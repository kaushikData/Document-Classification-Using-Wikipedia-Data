The year '''1965''' saw a number of significant events in '''[[radio broadcasting]]'''.

==Events==
*19 April: [[WINS (AM)]] in [[New York City, New York|New York]] switches from Top 40 to all-news, with the slogan "You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world."
*19 June: After a multi-year courtroom battle which involved [[NBC Radio Network#The 1956 Cleveland/Philadelphia ownership swap|accusations of extortion]], the FCC reversed a 1956 station ownership trade between [[Westinghouse Broadcasting]] and [[NBC]]. Westinghouse reclaimed their [[KYW (AM)|original Philadelphia stations]], while NBC was ordered to take over [[WTAM|their former owned-and-operated stations]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]. The KYW call letters originally went from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] to Cleveland in 1956, and back to Philadelphia with the reversal, with NBC renaming the Cleveland stations [[WTAM|WKYC AM]]/[[WMJI|FM]]/[[WKYC|TV]].
*18 August: [[Marlene Dietrich]] appears in "The Child" for [[BBC]] radio.
*21 September: [[KYW (AM)]], shortly after relocating back to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], institutes an all-news format patterned after [[WINS (AM)]].
*11 October: The Dutch popular-music channel Hilversum 3 (now [[3FM]]) begins broadcasting.
*12 December: New owner Westchester Broadcasting changes the call letters of WDOK (AM) in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to WIXY, installing a Top 40 format (today known as [[WCCR (AM)|WCCR]]). Their FM sister station retains the [[WDOK]] calls and [[beautiful music]] format.

===Unknown Dates===
*[[KMGL|KOFM]] signed on air in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]] with a [[Beautiful music|Beautiful Music]] format.

==Debuts==
*16 May: [[Cross Country Checkup]] debuts on [[CBC Radio]]
*4 October: Long-running lunchtime news and current affairs programme ''[[The World At One]]'' begins on the [[BBC Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4]]).

==Deaths==
*[[Martin De Haan]], 74. American [[Bible]] teacher, pastor, author. physician and the founder of ''Radio Bible Class''.
*January 20, [[Alan Freed]], 47, an American [[disc jockey]].&lt;ref name="coxotd"&gt;Cox, Jim (2008). ''This Day in Network Radio: A Daily Calendar of Births, Debuts, Cancellations and Other Events in Broadcasting History''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3848-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposed by an heraldic authority (such as the [[Court of Chivalry]] in England) or by royal decree for misconduct.  The practice of inverting the entire [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of an [[armiger]] found guilty of high [[treason]] has been attested since the [[Middle Ages]] and is generally accepted as reliable, and medieval heraldic sources cite at least one instance of removing an honourable charge from a coat of arms by royal decree as an abatement of honour.  Other abatements of honour implied by the addition of dishonourable [[Stain (heraldry)|stains]] and [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]], appearing in late 16th-century texts, have never been reliably attested in actual practice.  Additionally, as many heraldic writers note, the use of arms is not compulsory, so armigers are more likely to relinquish a dishonored coat of arms than to advertise their dishonor.

==Inverted arms==
The earliest mention in heraldic writing of a dishonorable display of arms (and, according to Fox-Davies, the only one reliably attested in actual use; see historical examples below)&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies /&gt; was inverting the entire shield, first documented by [[Johannes de Bado Aureo]] in his heraldic treatise ''Tractatus de armis'' (c. 1394).&lt;ref name=laurel&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/abate.html |last=Levin |first=Craig |title=Abatements and Augmentations of Honor |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary accounts of executions for treason describe the traitor being marched to his execution in a paper tabard displaying his inverted arms,&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies /&gt; and other accounts tell of displaying the inverted arms of prisoners, released on parole, who refuse to pay their ransom.&lt;ref name=laurel /&gt;

==Theoretical abatements==
Eight other abatements were introduced in the late 16th century, each prescribing a specific charge in a specific [[Stain (heraldry)|stain]] for a specific offense; though the charges themselves were uncommon but no less honourable than any other charge (if colored in any standard tincture or fur), it was only when displayed in the prescribed position and stain that these charges were supposed to be considered dishonourable.

Leigh (1562) enumerated the nine abatements thus:&lt;ref name=Oxford /&gt;

#Point dexter parted [[tenné]], for false claims of valor
#Point champaine tenné, for killing a prisoner who has demanded quarter
#Plain point [[sanguine (heraldry)|sanguine]], for one who lies to his sovereign
#Point in point sanguine, for cowardice
#Gusset sanguine borne to dexter, for adultery, or to sinister for a drunkard
#Gore sinister tenné, for cowardice in the face of the enemy
#Delf tenné, for revoking a challenge
#Inescutcheon reversed sanguine, for any man who "discourteously entreateth eyther maid or widow against her will, or flieth from his Soveraignes banner"&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, G. ''The Accedence of Armory,'' 1st ed. (London:1562). Quoted in Woodcock (1988), p.68.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The entire escutcheon inverted, for treason

Scottish herald [[Thomas Innes of Learney]] mentioned abatements in marital situations: "The law of arms provides for abating the arms of an adulterer by two gussets sanguine, and where the bearing of arms is necessary this, and one gusset (they will be close-gussets) for non-adulterous divorcees, are, at least in Patents, applied in the case of divorcees."&lt;ref name=IH&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.internationalheraldry.com/ |title=Abatements |publisher=InternationalHeraldry.com |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several notable modern heraldists have asserted that the execution of this system of abatements has never been attested in fact, and that the whole system was in all likelihood a theoretical exercise created by heralds for the purpose of discouraging armigers from committing dishonourable acts.&lt;ref name=Fox-Davies&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=Arthur Charles |authorlink=Arthur Charles Fox-Davies |year=1909 |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |location=London |publisher=T.C. &amp; E.C.

==Breaking or erasing charges==
[[File:Lion Coward.svg|thumb|right|150px|A lion ''couard'' is said to denote dishonor or cowardice.]]
As another form of abatement, some coats of arms were reportedly modified through breaking or cutting, reversing, or altogether erasing some existing charges, at least as they occur in patents, though the armiger's actual display of these defaced arms has not been documented and is unlikely.

In [[French heraldry]] the term ''diffamé'' is used to denote a lion or other animal whose tail is cut off, or may refer more broadly to arms which have been altered to signify loss of honor.  A lion with its tail between its hind legs is termed "couard" (coward), and has also been cited as a mark of infamy.&lt;ref name=IH /&gt;

Though lions are traditionally depicted with male genitals, a recent trend toward omitting the genitals has been controversial, prodding claims that emasculated lions have also been an historical form of abatement.  Commenting on the newly castrated lion in the arms of the [[Nordic Battle Group]] in 2007, Vladimir Sagerlund, heraldic artist at the [[Swedish National Archives]] since 1994, was critical of the politically motivated decision, stating, "once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the Crown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reported historical examples==
A few examples of historical abatements of arms have been recorded, though none of these reflect the addition of stained ordinaries as detailed above.  Rather, these include broken chevrons, disarmed lions, and reversed or erased charges.

One of these rare historical examples was [[Amery of Pavy]], who was appointed governor of [[Calais]] by King [[Edward III of England]] in 1347, and whose arms were abated by royal decree in 1349 after the failed French [[Siege of Calais (1348)|siege of Calais]] on the last day of December 1348, which resulted from Sir Amery's attempt to sell Calais to [[Geoffroi de Charny|Sir Geffrey Charney]], the French governor of nearby [[Saint-Omer]], for 20,000 [[Crown (English coin)|crowns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bicknell |first=W.

Guillim further explained that this humiliation is not inherited by the traitor's heirs, up to and including [[capital crime]]s, except in cases of [[high treason]].&lt;ref name=Guillim&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillim |first=John |date=1611 |title=A Display of Heraldrie |chapter=Section I Chapter VIII |url=http://www.btinternet.com/~paul.j.grant/guillim/s1/gu_s1c8.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015165207/http://www.btinternet.com/~paul.j.grant/guillim/s1/gu_s1c8.htm |archivedate=2008-10-15 |location=London |publisher=Printed by William Hall for Raphe Mab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a lion ''diffamée'' is that of [[John I, Count of Hainaut|Jean d'Avesnes]] who insulted his mother, [[Margaret II, Countess of Flanders]], in the presence of [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX]]. He is supposed to have seen the lion in his arms ''diffamée'' (i.e. the tail removed) and ''morné'' (i.e. the teeth and claws removed).&lt;ref name=IH /&gt;

'''Archibald Cary Coolidge''' (March 6, 1866 – January 14, 1928)&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[educator]] and diplomat.  He was a Professor of History at [[Harvard College]] from 1908 and the first Director of the [[Harvard University Library]] from 1910 until his death. Coolidge was also a scholar in international affairs, a planner of the [[Widener Library]], a member of the [[United States Foreign Service]], and editor-in-chief of the policy journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]''.&lt;ref name="INObit1928"/&gt;

==Early life ==

Archibald Coolidge was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] as the third of five boys.  His parents were [[Harvard University Law School]] graduate Joseph Randolph Coolidge and Julia ([[née]] Gardner) Coolidge, both from prominent and wealthy [[Boston Brahmin]] families.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;  His siblings included [[United States Ambassador to Nicaragua|U.S. Minister to Nicaragua]] [[John Gardner Coolidge]], noted lawyer [[Harold Jefferson Coolidge Sr.]] (the father of [[zoologist]] [[Harold Jefferson Coolidge Jr.]]), and mathematician and fellow Harvard professor [[Julian Coolidge|Julian Lowell Coolidge]].&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt;

His paternal uncle was [[T. Jefferson Coolidge|Thomas Jefferson Coolidge]], the Boston businessman and [[United States Ambassador to France|U.S. Minister to France]].  His father, Joseph Randolph Coolidge, was a great-grandson of the 3rd United States President [[Thomas Jefferson]], through his maternal grandparents, [[Thomas Mann Randolph Jr.]] and [[Martha Jefferson Randolph]].  Archibald's great-uncles were [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]], [[George Wythe Randolph]], [[Andrew Jackson Donelson]], and his grandfather, Joseph Coolidge, was a distant relative of President [[Calvin Coolidge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wead|first1=Doug|title=All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families|date=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=127–129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AzPd0aVnOl0C&amp;pg=PA127|isbn=9780743446334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his mother, Archibald was the nephew of [[John Lowell Gardner II]].  His mother and uncle John were the grandchildren of merchant [[Joseph Peabody]], one of the wealthiest men in the United States at the time of his death in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, F. [1858].

Coolidge attended seven different elementary and preparatory schools, the [[Adams Academy]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and [[Harvard College]], from which he emerged ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in history in 1887.  He also attended the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[École des Sciences Politiques]] in Paris.  He earned a Ph.D. from the [[University of Freiburg]] in Germany 1892.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[[Harold Jefferson Coolidge, Sr.|Coolidge, Harold Jefferson]]; Lord,  Robert Howard: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jDJSo80eRxsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=IS1VRMyiwa&amp;dq=%2B%22archibald%20cary%20coolidge%22&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Archibald Cary Coolidge: life and letters]'', 1932 (reprinted 1971), {{ISBN|0-8369-6641-4}}. URL retrieved 2011-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1893 on, he taught various history courses at Harvard, first as an instructor, from 1899 on as Assistant Professor, and in 1908, he was made a full Professor of History.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; 

Coolidge today is recognized as having turned the [[Harvard College Library]] into a major research institution.  In 1908, he was appointed to the Harvard Library Council and was chairman of this council in 1909. In 1910, he became the first Director of the Harvard University Library. Coolidge's tenure saw the building of the [[Widener Library]].&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;Harvard University Archives, call no.

===Diplomatic career===
Between college terms and parallel to his post at Harvard, Coolidge also pursued a career in [[diplomacy]], which fit his travel interests and his desire and aptitude for learning languages well.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;  He held posts as secretary to the American legation in Saint Petersburg, Russia (1890–1891), as private secretary to the American minister in France (1892), and as secretary to the American legation in Vienna (1893).

At the end of [[World War I]], more important assignments followed. Coolidge joined the [[The Inquiry|Inquiry]] study group established by [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt; The [[U.S. State Department]] sent him in 1918 to Russia to report on the situation there. In 1919, he was made the head of the so-called Coolidge Mission, which was "appointed by the American Delegation on 27 December and set up headquarters in Vienna.".&lt;ref&gt;Arno J.

In 1921, Coolidge worked as a negotiator for the [[American Relief Administration]] and helped organize the humanitarian aid to Russia after the [[Russian famine of 1921|famine of 1921]].&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; Coolidge also was one of the founders of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], which grew out of the Inquiry study group, and served as the first editor of its publication ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' from 1922 until his death in 1928.&lt;ref name="grose"&gt;Grose, P.: ''[http://i.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/Continuing_The_Inquiry.pdf Continuing the Inquiry: The Council on Foreign Relations from 1921 to 1996]''.

Coolidge was also a member of the [[Monticello Association]], which was created in 1913 to care for and preserve [[President Jefferson]]'s home, [[Monticello]], serving as its president from 1919 to 1925.&lt;ref name="life328"&gt;Coolidge, H.J.; Lord, R.H.: ''Archibald Cary Coolidge: life and letters'', p.&amp;nbsp;328.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Japan |periods |image=Satsuma-samurai-during-boshin-war-period.jpg |caption=[[Samurai]] of the [[Shimazu clan]].}}
{{nihongo|'''''Bakumatsu'''''|幕末|bakumatsu|a compound word, translatable as "the end" or ''matsu'' of the military government or ''baku'', which abbreviates ''bakufu'', in turn literally meaning "tent-government"}} refers to the final years of the [[Edo period]] when the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] [[Meiji Restoration|ended]]. Between 1853 and 1867, Japan ended its [[isolationist foreign policy]] known as ''[[sakoku]]'' and changed from a [[feudalism|feudal]] [[Tokugawa_shogunate|Tokugawa]] shogunate to the pre-modern empire of the [[Meiji period|Meiji government]]. The major ideological-political divide during this period was between the pro-imperial [[nationalism|nationalist]]s called ''[[Shishi (organization)|ishin shishi]]'' and the [[shogunate]] forces, which included the elite [[shinsengumi]] swordsmen.

Although these two groups were the most visible powers, many other factions attempted to use the chaos of Bakumatsu to seize personal power.&lt;ref name="Shinsengumi"&gt;Hillsborough, ''page # needed''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2013}} Furthermore, there were two other main driving forces for dissent: first, growing resentment on the part of the ''[[tozama daimyō]]''  (or outside lords), and second, growing anti-Western sentiment following the arrival of [[Matthew C. Perry]]. The first related to those lords whose predecessors had fought against Tokugawa forces at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600 and had, from that point on, been excluded permanently from all powerful positions within the shogunate. The second was to be expressed in the phrase ''[[sonnō jōi]]'', or "revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians". The turning point of the Bakumatsu was during the [[Boshin War]] and the [[Battle of Toba–Fushimi]] when pro-shogunate forces were defeated.&lt;ref name="LS"&gt;Ravina, ''page # needed''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2013}}

== Foreign frictions ==
{{main|Sakoku}}
[[File:Russians meeting Japanese in Akkeshi 1779.jpg|thumb|left|[[Empire of Japan–Russian Empire relations|Russians meeting Japanese]] in 1779]]

[[Image:MorrisonShip.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Morrison'' of [[Charles W. King]], was repelled from [[Edo Bay]] in 1837.]]

Frictions with foreign shipping led Japan to take defensive actions from the beginning of the 19th century. Western ships were increasing their presence around Japan due to [[whaling]] activities and the [[Qing Dynasty|China]] trade. They were hoping for Japan to become a base for supply or at least a place where shipwrecks could receive assistance. [[Nagasaki Harbour Incident|The violent demands made]] by the British frigate ''Phaeton'' in 1808 shocked many in Japan.&lt;ref name="Jansen 2002 p.287"&gt;Jansen 2002, p.287&lt;/ref&gt; In 1825, the {{nihongo|[[Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels|Edict to expel foreigners]] at all cost|異国船無二念打払令|Ikokusen Muninen Uchiharairei|"Don't think twice" policy}} was issued by the shogunate, prohibiting any contacts with foreigners; it remained in place until 1842.

[[File:Satsuma 150 pound cannon 1849.jpg|thumb|A 150-pound [[Artillery of Japan|Satsuma cannon]], built in 1849. It was mounted on Fort Tenpozan at [[Kagoshima]]. Caliber: 290mm, length: 4220mm]]

Meanwhile, Japan endeavoured to learn about foreign sciences through [[rangaku]] ("Western studies"). To reinforce Japan's capability to carry on the orders to repel Westerners, some such as the [[Nagasaki]]-based [[Takashima Shūhan]] managed to obtain weapons through the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] at [[Dejima]], such as field guns, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and [[firearms]].&lt;ref name="Jansen 2002 p.287"/&gt; Domains sent students to learn from Takashima in Nagasaki, from [[Satsuma Domain]] after the intrusion of an American warship in 1837 in [[Kagoshima Bay]], and from [[Saga Domain]] and [[Chōshū Domain]], all southern domains mostly exposed to Western intrusions.&lt;ref name="Kornicki"&gt;Kornicki, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JB_KSp6widMC&amp;pg=PA246 p. 246]&lt;/ref&gt; These domains also studied the manufacture of Western weapons. By 1852 Satsuma and Saga had [[reverberatory furnace]]s to produce the iron necessary for firearms.&lt;ref name="Kornicki"/&gt;

Following the [[Morrison incident|''Morrison'' incident]] involving the ''Morrison'' under [[Charles W. King]] in 1837, [[Egawa Hidetatsu]] was put in charge of establishing the defense of [[Tokyo Bay]] against Western intrusions in 1839.&lt;ref name= "Cullen p. 158-159"&gt;Cullen, pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; After the victory of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] over the Chinese in the 1840 [[Opium War]], many Japanese realized that traditional ways would not be sufficient to repel Western intrusions. To resist Western military forces, Western guns were studied and demonstrations made in 1841 by [[Takashima Shūhan]] to the Tokugawa shogunate.&lt;ref name="Jansen 2002 p.287"/&gt;

A national debate was already taking place about how to better avoid foreign domination. Some such as Egawa claimed that it was necessary to use the foreigners' techniques to repel them. Others, such as [[Torii Yōzō]] argued that only traditional Japanese methods should be employed and reinforced.&lt;ref name= "Jansen p. 124"&gt;Jansen 1995, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Egawa argued that just as [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]] had been introduced from abroad, it made sense to introduce useful Western techniques.&lt;ref name= "Jansen p. 124"/&gt; A theoretical synthesis of "Western knowledge" and "Eastern morality" would later be accomplished by [[Sakuma Shōzan]] and [[Yokoi Shōnan]], in view of "controlling the [[barbarians]] with their own methods".&lt;ref name= "Jansen pp. 126–130"&gt;Jansen 1995, pp. 126–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1839, however, traditionalists tended to prevail. Students of Western sciences were accused of treason (''[[Bansha no goku]]''), put under house arrest ([[Takashima Shūhan]]), forced to commit ritual suicide ([[Watanabe Kazan]], [[Takano Chōei]]), or even assassinated as in the case of [[Sakuma Shōzan]].

== Commodore Perry (1853–54) ==

When [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s four-ship squadron appeared in [[Tokyo Bay|Edo Bay]] (Tokyo Bay) in July 1853, the shogunate was thrown into turmoil. Commodore Perry was fully prepared for hostilities if his negotiations with the Japanese failed, and threatened to open fire if the Japanese refused to negotiate. He gave them two white flags, telling them to hoist the flags when they wished a bombardment from his fleet to cease and to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Takekoshi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mvfMKV1b1fwC&amp;pg=PA285 pp. 285–86]&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate his weapons, Perry ordered his ships to attack several buildings around the harbor. The ships of Perry were equipped with new [[Paixhans gun|Paixhans shell guns]], capable of bringing destruction everywhere a shell landed.&lt;ref&gt;Millis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=PcGpkzmjFbgC&amp;pg=PA88 p. 88]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walworth, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bFyV2BZMCRwC&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Reverberatory furnace of Nirayama.jpg|thumb|{{nihongo|[[Nirayama, Shizuoka|Nirayama]]|韮山}} [[reverberatory furnace]] in [[Izunokuni, Shizuoka]] built by [[Egawa Hidetatsu]]. Construction began in November 1853 and was completed in 1857; it operated until 1864.{{efn|A Dutch book entitled ''The Casting Processes at the National Iron Cannon Foundry in Luik'' (''Het Gietwezen ins Rijks Iizer-Geschutgieterij, to Luik'') written in 1826 by [[Huguenin Ulrich]] (1755–1833) was used as a reference to build the furnace.&lt;ref name="Iida"/&gt;}}]]

Fortifications were established at [[Odaiba]] in [[Tokyo Bay]] in order to protect Edo from an American incursion. Industrial developments were also soon started in order to build modern cannons. A [[reverbatory furnace]] was established by [[Egawa Hidetatsu]] in [[Nirayama, Shizuoka|Nirayama]] to cast cannons.&lt;ref name="Iida"&gt;Iida, [http://d-arch.ide.go.jp/je_archive/society/wp_je_unu8.html 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts were made at building Western-style warships such as the [[Japanese warship Shohei Maru|''Shōhei Maru'']] by using Dutch textbooks.

The American fleet returned in 1854. The chairman of the senior councillors, [[Abe Masahiro]], was responsible for dealing with the Americans. Having no precedent to manage this threat to [[national security]], Abe tried to balance the desires of the senior councillors to compromise with the foreigners, of the emperor who wanted to keep the foreigners out, and of the feudal ''[[daimyō]]'' rulers who wanted to go to war. Lacking consensus, Abe compromised by accepting Perry's demands for opening Japan to foreign trade while also making military preparations. In March 1854, the [[Convention of Kanagawa|Treaty of Peace and Amity]] (or Treaty of Kanagawa) maintained the prohibition on trade but opened the ports of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] and [[Hakodate]] to American whaling ships seeking provisions, guaranteed good treatment to shipwrecked American sailors, and allowed a United States consul to take up residence in [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]], a seaport on the [[Izu Peninsula]], southwest of Edo. In February 1855, the Russians followed suit with the [[Treaty of Shimoda]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Political troubles and modernization ===
[[Image:NagasakiNavalTrainingCenter.jpg|thumb|The [[Nagasaki Naval Training Center]], in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], near [[Dejima]]]]

The resulting damage to the shogunate was significant. Debate over government policy was unusual and had engendered public criticism of the shogunate. In the hope of enlisting the support of new allies, Abe, to the consternation of the ''[[fudai daimyō]]s'', had consulted with the ''[[Shinpan (daimyō)|shinpan]]'' and ''[[tozama daimyō]]s'', further undermining the already weakened ''[[bakufu]]''.

In the [[Ansei Treaties|Ansei Reform]] (1854–1856), Abe then tried to strengthen the regime by ordering Dutch warships and armaments from the Netherlands and building new port defenses. In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the shogunate acquired its first steam warship, ''[[Kankō Maru]]'', which was used for training, and opened the [[Nagasaki Naval Training Center]] with Dutch instructors, while a Western-style military school was established at Edo. In 1857, it acquired its first screw-driven steam warship, the [[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']]. Scientific knowledge was quickly expanded from the pre-existing foundation of Western knowledge (''[[Rangaku]]'', "Dutch learning").

Opposition to Abe increased within ''fudai'' circles, which opposed opening shogunate councils to ''tozama daimyōs'', and he was replaced in 1855 as chairman of the senior councilors by [[Hotta Masayoshi]] (1810–1864). At the head of the dissident faction was [[Tokugawa Nariaki]], who had long embraced a militant loyalty to the emperor along with anti-foreign sentiments, and who had been put in charge of national defense in 1854. The [[Mito school]]—based on neo-Confucian and Shinto principles—had as its goal the restoration of the imperial institution, the turning back of the West.

===Earthquakes===
The years 1854-1855 saw a dramatic series of earthquakes, known as the [[Ansei great earthquakes]], with 120 major and minor temblors recorded over a less than two-year period including the 8.4 magnitude [[1854 Tōkai earthquake]] on 23 December 1854, the 8.4 magnitude [[1854 Nankai earthquake]] occurring the following day, and the 6.9 magnitude [[1855 Edo earthquake]], which struck what is today modern Tokyo, on 11 November 1855. An earthquake and tsunami struck [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] on the [[Izu Peninsula]] during the December 23 [[1854 Tōkai earthquake]], and because the port had just been designated as the prospective location for a US consulate, some construed the natural disasters as demonstration of the displeasure of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=6O8VyhDbUPgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=yokohama+burning&amp;sig=rbgbEDXJV5fht4wdSD1HBoAMANg#PPA65,M1 p. 65]&lt;/ref&gt; As the earthquakes were blamed by many Japanese on a giant catfish (''[[Namazu (Japanese mythology)|Namazu]]'') thrashing about, [[Ukiyo-e]] prints depicting ''namazu'' became very popular during this time.

== Treaties of Amity and Commerce (1858) ==
[[Image:TownsendHarris1855JamesBogle.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Townsend Harris]] negotiated the "[[Harris Treaty|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]]" in 1858, opening Japan to foreign influence and trade, under unequal conditions.]]
[[Image:Yokohama 1859.jpg|thumb|View of [[Yokohama]] in 1859.]]

Following the nomination of [[Townsend Harris]] as U.S. Consul in 1856 and two years of negotiation, the "[[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]]" was signed in 1858 and put into application from mid-1859. In a major diplomatic coup, Harris had abundantly pointed out the aggressive colonialism of France and Great Britain against China in the current [[Second Opium War]] (1856–1860), suggesting that these countries would not hesitate to go to war against Japan as well, and that the United States offered a peaceful alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Satow, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important points of the Treaty were:

* exchange of diplomatic agents.
* [[Edo]], [[Kobe]], [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], and [[Yokohama]]’s opening to foreign trade as ports.
* ability of United States citizens to live and trade at will in those ports (only [[opium]] trade was prohibited).
* a system of [[extraterritoriality]] that provided for the subjugation of foreign residents to the laws of their own [[consular court]]s instead of the Japanese law system.
* fixed low import-export duties, subject to international control
* ability for Japan to purchase American shipping and weapons (three American steamships were delivered to Japan in 1862).

Japan was also forced to apply any further conditions granted to other foreign nations in the future to the United States, under the "most favoured nation" provision. Soon several foreign nations followed suit and obtained treaties with Japan (the [[Ansei Five-Power Treaties]], with the United States ([[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-Japan)|Harris Treaty]]) on July 29, 1858, Dutch ([[Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the Netherlands and Japan]]) on August 18, Russia ([[Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Russia and Japan]]) August 19, Great Britain ([[Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce]]) on August 26, and France ([[Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and Japan]]) on October 9).

Trading houses were quickly set up in the open ports.

== Crisis and conflict ==

=== Political crisis ===
[[Image:Hotta.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hotta Masayoshi]] (1810–1864)]]

[[Hotta Masayoshi|Hotta]] lost the support of key ''daimyōs'', and when [[Tokugawa Nariaki]] opposed the new treaty, Hotta sought imperial sanction. The court officials, perceiving the weakness of the ''bakufu'', rejected Hotta's request which resulted in the resignation of himself, and thus suddenly embroiled Kyoto and the emperor in Japan's internal politics for the first time in many centuries. When the ''shōgun'' died without an [[heir]], Nariaki appealed to the court for support of his own son, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] (or Keiki), for ''shōgun'', a reformist candidate favored by the ''shinpan'' and ''tozama daimyōs''. The ''fudai'' won the power struggle, however, installing the 12 year old [[Tokugawa Iemochi]] as ''shōgun'' whom it was perceived Tairō [[Ii Naosuke]] would have influence over, ultimately placing Nariaki and Yoshinobu under house arrest, and [[Execution (legal)|executing]] [[Yoshida Shōin]] (1830–1859, a leading ''sonnō-jōi'' intellectual who had opposed the American treaty and plotted a revolution against the bakufu) known as [[Ansei Purge]].

=== Attacks on foreigners and their supporters ===
[[Image:BritishLegationAttack1861.jpg|thumb|left|Attack on the British legation in Edo, July 1861.]]
[[File:Arimura Jisaemon.jpg|thumb|Assassination of Tairō [[Ii Naosuke]] in the [[Sakuradamon Incident (1860)|Sakuradamon incident (1860)]].]]

From 1859, the ports of [[Nagasaki]], [[Hakodate]] and [[Yokohama]] became open to foreign traders as a consequence of the Treaties.&lt;ref&gt;Satow, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners arrived in Yokohama and [[Kanagawa]] in great numbers, giving rise to trouble with the samurai.&lt;ref name="Satow, p.34"&gt;Satow, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Violence increased against the foreigners and those who dealt with them. Murders of foreigners and collaborating Japanese soon followed. On 26 August 1859, a Russian sailor was cut to pieces in the streets of Yokohama.&lt;ref name="Satow, p.34"/&gt; In early 1860, two Dutch captains were slaughtered, also in Yokohama.&lt;ref name="Satow, p.34"/&gt; Chinese and native servants of foreigners were also killed.&lt;ref name="Satow, p.34"&gt;Satow, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Tairō [[Ii Naosuke]], who had signed the Harris Treaty and tried to eliminate opposition to Westernization with the [[Ansei Purge]], was himself murdered in March 1860 in the [[Sakuradamon Incident (1860)|Sakuradamon incident]]. A servant of the French Minister was attacked at the end of 1860.&lt;ref name="Satow, p.34"&gt;Satow, p.34&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 1861, [[Henry Heusken]], Secretary to the American mission, was attacked and murdered.&lt;ref name="Satow, p.34"/&gt; On 5 July 1861, a group of samurai attacked the British Legation, resulting in two deaths.&lt;ref name="Satow, p.34"/&gt; During this period, about one foreigner was killed every month. The [[Namamugi Incident|Richardson Affair]] occurred in September 1862, forcing foreign nations to take decisive action in order to protect foreigners and guarantee the implementation of Treaty provisions. In May 1863, the US legation in Edo was torched.

The opening of Japan to uncontrolled foreign trade brought massive economic instability. While some entrepreneurs prospered, many others went bankrupt. [[Unemployment]] rose, as well as [[inflation]]. Coincidentally, major famines also increased the price of food drastically. Incidents occurred between brash foreigners, qualified as "the scum of the earth" by a contemporary diplomat, and the Japanese.

[[File:Tokugawa coinage.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Japan's monetary system, based on [[Tokugawa coinage]], broke down due to foreign [[arbitrage]].]]
[[File:Allegory of inflation during the Bakumatsu era.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Allegory of [[inflation]] and soaring prices during the Bakumatsu era]]

Japan's monetary system, based on [[Tokugawa coinage]], also broke down. Traditionally, Japan's exchange rate between gold and silver was 1:5, whereas international rates were of the order of 1:15. This led to massive purchases of gold by foreigners, and ultimately forced the Japanese authorities to devalue their currency.&lt;ref name="DowerChaos"&gt;Dower p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; There was a massive [[Gresham's law|outflow of gold]] from Japan, as foreigners rushed to exchange their silver for "token" silver Japanese coinage and again exchange these against gold, giving a 200% profit to the transaction. In 1860, about 4 million [[ryō]]s thus left Japan,&lt;ref name="Metzler p.15"&gt;Metzler p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; that is about 70 tons of gold. This effectively destroyed Japan's gold standard system, and forced it to return to weight-based system with International rates. The Bakufu instead responded to the crises by debasing the gold content of its coins by two thirds, so as to match foreign gold-silver exchange ratios.&lt;ref name="Metzler p.15"/&gt;

Foreigners also brought [[cholera]] to Japan, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths.&lt;ref name="DowerChaos"/&gt;

During the 1860s, peasant uprisings (hyakushō ikki) and urban disturbances (uchikowashi) multiplied. "World renewal" movement appeared (yonaoshi ikki), as well as feverish hysteric movements such as the [[Ee ja nai ka|Eejanaika]] ("Why Not?").

Several missions were sent abroad by the Bakufu, in order to learn about Western civilization, revise [[unequal treaties]], and delay the opening of cities and harbour to foreign trade. These efforts towards revision remained largely unsuccessful.

A [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|Japanese Embassy to the United States]] was sent in 1860, on board the [[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']] and the USS ''Powhattan''. A [[First Japanese Embassy to Europe (1862)|First Japanese Embassy to Europe]] was sent in 1862.

=== Imperial Order to Expel Barbarians (1863) ===
[[File:Foreigner and Wrestler at Yokohama 1861.jpg|thumb|left|An 1861 image expressing the ''[[Jōi]]'' ({{lang|ja|攘夷}}, "Expel the Barbarians") sentiment]]

Belligerent opposition to Western influence further erupted into open conflict when the [[Emperor Kōmei]], breaking with centuries of imperial tradition, began to take an active role in matters of state and issued, on March 11 and April 11, 1863, his {{nihongo|"[[Order to expel barbarians]]"|攘夷実行の勅命|jōi jikkō no chokumei}}.

[[Image:ShimonosekiShooting.jpg|thumb|Japanese cannons shooting on Western shipping at [[Shimonoseki]] in 1863. Japanese painting]]

The Mōri clan of [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]], under Lord [[Mōri Takachika]], followed on the order, and began to take actions to expel all foreigners from the date fixed as a deadline (May 10, Lunar calendar). Openly defying the shogunate, Takachika ordered his forces to fire without warning on all foreign ships traversing [[Shimonoseki Strait]].

Under pressure from the Emperor, the Shogun was also forced to issue a declaration promulgating the end of relations with foreigners. The order was forwarded to foreign legations by Ogasawara Zusho no Kami on June 24, 1863:

{{quote|"The orders of the [[Taikun|Tycoon]], received from [[Kyoto]], are to the effect that the ports are to be closed and the foreigners driven out, because the people of the country do not desire intercourse with foreign countries."|Missive of Ogasawara Dzusho no Kami, June 24, 1863, quoted in ''A Diplomat in Japan'', Ernest Satow, p75}}

[[Lieutenant-Colonel Neale]], head of the British legation, responded on very strong terms, equating the move with a declaration of war:

{{quote|"It is, in fact, a declaration of war by Japan itself against the whole of the Treaty Powers, and the consequences of which, if not at once arrested, it will have to expiate by the severest and most merited chastisement"|Edward Neale, June 24, 1863. Quoted in ''A Diplomat in Japan'', Ernest Satow, p77}}

A [[Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (1863)|Second Japanese Embassy to Europe]] would be sent in December 1863, with the mission to obtain European support to reinstate Japan's former closure to foreign trade, and especially stop foreign access to the harbor of [[Yokohama]]. The Embassy ended in total failure as European powers did not see any advantages in yielding to its demands.

== Military interventions against Sonnō Jōi (1863–1865) ==
{{Late Tokugawa conflicts}}
American influence, so important in the beginning, waned after 1861 due to the advent of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) that monopolized all available U.S. resources. This influence would be replaced by that of the British, the Dutch and the French.

The two ringleaders of the opposition to the Bakufu were from the provinces Satsuma (present day Kagoshima prefecture) and Chōshū (present-day Yamaguchi prefecture), two of the strongest tozama anti-shogunate domains in Edo period Japan. Satsuma military leaders Saigō Takamori and Okubo Toshimichi were brought together with Katsura Kogorō (Kido Takayoshi) of Chōshū. As they happened to be directly involved in the murder of Richardson for the former, and the attacks on foreign shipping in Shimonoseki for the latter, and as the Bakufu declared itself unable to placate them, Allied forces decided to mount direct military expeditions.

=== American intervention (July 1863) ===
[[Image:ShimonosekiWyomingAttacks.jpg|thumb|The [[USS Wyoming (1859)|USS ''Wyoming'']] battling in the Shimonoseki Straits against the Choshu steam warships ''Daniel Webster'' (six guns), the brig ''Lanrick'' (''Kosei'', with ten guns), and the steamer ''Lancefield'' (''Koshin'', of four guns).]]
{{main|Naval battle of Shimonoseki}}

In the morning of July 16, 1863, under sanction by Minister Pruyn, in an apparent swift response to the attack on the ''Pembroke'', the U.S. frigate [[USS Wyoming (1859)|USS ''Wyoming'']] under Captain McDougal himself sailed into the strait and single-handedly engaged the U.S.-built but poorly manned rebel fleet. For almost two hours before withdrawing, McDougal sank one enemy vessel and severely damaged the other two, along with some forty Japanese casualties, while the ''Wyoming'' suffered extensive damage with fourteen crew dead or wounded.

=== French intervention (August 1863) ===
{{main|Bombardment of Shimonoseki}}

On the heels of McDougal's engagement, two weeks later a French landing force of two warships, the ''Tancrède'' and the ''[[FS Dupleix (1861)|Dupleix]]'', and 250 men under Captain [[Benjamin Jaurès]] swept into Shimonoseki and destroyed a small town, together with at least one artillery emplacement.

=== British bombardment of Kagoshima (August 1863) ===
[[Image:KagoshimaBirdView.jpg|thumb|Birds-eye view of the bombardment of [[Kagoshima]] by the [[Royal Navy]], August 15, 1863. ''[[Le Monde Illustré]]''.]]
{{main|Bombardment of Kagoshima}}

In August 1863, the Bombardment of Kagoshima took place, in retaliation for the [[Namamugi Incident|Namamugi incident]] and the murder of the English trader Richardson. The British [[Royal Navy]] bombarded the town of [[Kagoshima]] and destroyed several ships. Satsuma however later negotiated and paid 25,000 pounds, but did not remit Richardson's killers, and in exchange obtained an agreement by Great Britain to supply steam warships to Satsuma. The conflict actually became the starting point of a close relationship between Satsuma and Great Britain, which became major allies in the ensuing [[Boshin War]]. From the start, the [[Satsuma Province]] had generally been in favour of the opening and modernization of Japan. Although the Namamugi Incident was unfortunate, it was not characteristic of Satsuma's policy, and was rather abusively branded as an example of anti-foreign [[sonnō jōi]] sentiment, as a justification to a strong Western show of force.

=== Repression of the Mito rebellion (May 1864) ===
{{main|Mito Rebellion}}
[[File:Bakumatsu Hoheitai 1864.jpg|thumb|left|Shogunate troops moving to quell the [[Mito Rebellion|Mito rebellion]] in 1864]]

On 2 May 1864, another rebellion erupted against the power of the shogunate, the [[Mito Rebellion|Mito rebellion]]. This rebellion also was in the name of the ''[[sonnō jōi]]'', the expulsion of the Western "barbarians" and the return to Imperial rule. The shogunate managed to send an army to quell the revolt, which was ended in blood with the surrender of the rebels on 14 January 1865.

=== Chōshū rebellion ===
{{main|Kinmon Incident|First Chōshū expedition}}
In the [[Kinmon Incident]] on 20 August 1864, troops from [[Chōshū Domain]] attempted to take control of Kyoto and the Imperial Palace in order to pursue the objective of ''[[Sonnō Jōi]]''. This also led to a punitive expedition by the Tokugawa government, the [[First Chōshū expedition]] (長州征討).

=== Allied bombardment of Shimonoseki (September 1864) ===
[[Image:Shimonoseki.JPG|thumb|The [[Shimonoseki Campaign|Bombardment of Shimonoseki]], 1863–1864]]
{{main|Bombardment of Shimonoseki}}

Western nations planned an armed retaliation against armed Japanese opposition with the Bombardment of Shimonoseki. The Allied intervention occurred in September 1864, combining the naval forces of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[French Second Empire|France]] and the United States, against the powerful ''daimyō'' [[Mōri Takachika]] of the [[Chōshū Domain]] based in [[Shimonoseki]], [[Japan]]. This conflict threatened to involve America, which in 1864, was already torn by its own civil war.

=== Conservative reaffirmation ===
Following these successes against the imperial movement in Japan, the shogunate was able to reassert a certain level of primacy at the end of 1864. The traditional policy of ''[[sankin-kōtai]]'' was reinstated, and remnants of the rebellions of 1863–64 as well as the [[Shishi (organization)|''Shishi'']] movement were brutally suppressed throughout the land.&lt;ref&gt;Totman, pp. 140–147&lt;/ref&gt;

The military interventions by foreign powers also proved that Japan was no military match against the West, and that expelling foreigners was not a realistic policy. The ''sonnō jōi'' movement thus lost its initial impetus. The structural weaknesses of the Bakufu however remained an issue, and the focus of opposition would then shift to creating a strong government under a single authority.

== Twilight of the Bakufu ==

=== Hyōgo naval expedition (November 1865) ===
[[Image:JapaneseBakufuInfantryApril1867.JPG|thumb|Japanese Bakufu Infantry (Osaka, 29 April 1867). Painting by [[Jules Brunet]].]]

As the Bakufu proved incapable to pay the $3,000,000 indemnity demanded by foreign nations for the intervention at Shimonoseki, foreign nations agreed to reduce the amount in exchange for a ratification of the Harris Treaty by the Emperor, a lowering of customs tariffs to a uniform 5%, and the opening of the harbours of Hyōgo (modern [[Kōbe]]) and [[Osaka]] to foreign trade. In order to press their demands more forcefully, a squadron of four British, one Dutch and three French warships were sent to the harbour of Hyōgo in November 1865. Various incursions were made by foreign forces, until the Emperor finally agreed to change his total opposition to the Treaties, by formally allowing the ''shōgun'' to handle negotiations with foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;Satow, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicts led to the realization that head-on conflict with Western nations was not a solution for Japan. As the Bakufu continued its modernization efforts, Western ''daimyōs'' (especially from Satsuma and Chōshū) also continued to modernize intensively in order to build a stronger Japan and to establish a more legitimate government under Imperial power.

=== Second Chōshū expedition (June 1866) ===
{{main|Second Chōshū expedition}}
[[File:Samurai troops in the Second Choshu expedition.jpg|thumb|left|Shogunate [[Samurai]] troops in the [[Second Chōshū expedition]] ]]

The shogunate led a second punitive expedition against Chōshū from June 1866, but the shogunate was actually defeated by the more modern and better organized troops of Chōshū. The new ''shōgun'' [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] managed to negotiate a ceasefire due to the death of the previous ''shōgun'', but the prestige of the shogunate was nevertheless seriously affected.

This reversal encouraged the Bakufu to take drastic steps towards modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen 1995, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewal and modernization===
[[Image:Kanrinmaru.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']], Japan's first screw-driven steam warship, 1855]]

During the last years of the ''bakufu'', or ''bakumatsu'', the ''bakufu'' took strong measures to try to reassert its dominance, although its involvement with modernization and foreign powers was to make it a target of anti-Western sentiment throughout the country.

[[Image:TokugawaYoshinobu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]], the last ''shōgun'', in French military uniform, c. 1867]]

Naval students were sent to study in Western naval schools for several years, starting a tradition of foreign-educated future leaders, such as Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. The French naval engineer [[Léonce Verny]] was hired to build naval arsenals, such as [[Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. By the end of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868, the Japanese navy of the ''shōgun'' already possessed eight western-style steam warships around the flagship [[Japanese battleship Kaiyō Maru|''Kaiyō Maru'']], which were used against pro-imperial forces during the [[Boshin War]], under the command of Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki|Enomoto]]. A [[French Military Mission to Japan (1867)]] was established to help modernize the armies of the [[Bakufu]]. Japan sent a delegation to and participated in the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|1867 World Fair]] in Paris.

[[File:Secret imperial order of overthrow the Tokugawa Shogunate.JPG|thumb|left|Secret imperial order of overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate (1867)]]

[[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] (informally known as Keiki) reluctantly became head of the Tokugawa house and ''shōgun'' following the unexpected death of [[Tokugawa Iemochi]] in mid-1866. In 1867, [[Emperor Kōmei]] died and was succeeded by his second son, Mutsuhito, as [[Emperor Meiji]]. Tokugawa Yoshinobu tried to reorganize the government under the Emperor while preserving the ''shōgun''{{'}}s leadership role, a system known as ''kōbu gattai''. Fearing the growing power of the Satsuma and Chōshū ''daimyōs'', other ''daimyōs'' called for returning the ''shōgun''{{'}}s political power to the emperor and a council of ''daimyōs'' chaired by the former Tokugawa ''shōgun''. With the threat of an imminent Satsuma-Chōshū led military action, Yoshinobu moved pre-emptively by surrendering some of his previous authority.

=== Boshin War ===
[[Image:ShogunalTroops1864.jpg|thumb|Shogunal troops in 1864, ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]
[[Image:BakufuTroopsIn1867.JPG|thumb|Bakumatsu troops near [[Mount Fuji]] in 1867. Painting by [[Jules Brunet]] ]]
{{main|Boshin War}}

After Keiki had temporarily avoided the growing conflict, anti-shogunal forces instigated widespread turmoil in the streets of Edo using groups of ''rōnin''. Satsuma and Chōshū forces then moved on Kyoto in force, pressuring the Imperial Court for a conclusive edict demolishing the shogunate. Following a conference of ''daimyōs'', the Imperial Court issued such an edict, removing the power of the shogunate in the dying days of 1867. The Satsuma, Chōshū, and other ''han'' leaders and radical courtiers, however, [[rebellion|rebelled]], seized the [[Japanese imperial palace|imperial palace]], and announced their own restoration on January 3, 1868. Keiki nominally accepted the plan, retiring from the Imperial Court to Osaka at the same time as resigning as ''shōgun''. Fearing a feigned concession of the shogunal power to consolidate power, the dispute continued until culminating in a military confrontation between Tokugawa and allied domains with Satsuma, Tosa and Chōshū forces, in Fushimi and Toba. With the turning of the battle toward anti-shogunal forces, Keiki then quit Osaka for Edo, essentially ending both the power of the Tokugawa, and the shogunate that had ruled Japan for over 250 years.

Following the [[Boshin War]] (1868–1869), the ''bakufu'' was abolished, and Keiki was reduced to the ranks of the common ''daimyōs''. Resistance continued in the North throughout 1868, and the ''bakufu'' [[navy|naval forces]] under Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] continued to hold out for another six months in [[Hokkaidō]], where they founded the short-lived [[Republic of Ezo]]. This defiance ended in May 1869 at the [[Battle of Hakodate]], after one month of fighting.

[[File:Maria Elizabeth Winblad (1895-1987) birth certificate.jpg|thumb|Birth certificate of Mary Elizabeth Winblad (1895–1987)]]
A '''birth certificate''' is a [[vital record]] that documents the [[Childbirth|birth of a child]]. The term "birth certificate" can refer to either the original document certifying the circumstances of the birth or to a certified copy of or representation of the ensuing registration of that birth. Depending on the jurisdiction, a record of birth might or might not contain verification of the event by such as a midwife or doctor.

==History and contemporary times==
[[File:Russian birth certificate of Michael Lucas.JPG|thumb|A Soviet birth certificate from 1972.]]
The documentation of births is a practice widely held throughout human civilization, especially in China, Egypt, Greece, Rome, and Persia. The original purpose of vital statistics was for tax purposes and for the determination of available military manpower. In [[England]], births were initially registered with churches, who maintained registers of births. This practice continued into the 19th century.&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;[http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Planning_eval/Vital_Statistics/VR_HBK_2006_Rev.pdf ''Vital Records Registration Handbook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411110141/http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Planning_eval/Vital_Statistics/VR_HBK_2006_Rev.pdf |date=11 April 2008 }} (Jacksonville, FL: Florida Office of Vital Statistics, 2007) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The compulsory registration of births with the [[United Kingdom]] government is a practice that originated at least as far back as 1853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/aboutus/index.asp "About Us"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801134846/http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/aboutus/index.asp |date=1 August 2008 }} (UK General Registry Office), accessed August 2009, .&lt;/ref&gt; The entire United States did not get a standardized system until 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumberg|first1=H.L.|last2=Dozor|first2=D.|last3=Golombek|first3=S.G.|title=History of the birth certificate: from inception to the future of electronic data|journal=Journal of Perinatology|date=June 2012|volume=32|pages=407–411|doi=10.1038/jp.2012.3|url=http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v32/n6/full/jp20123a.html|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries have statutes and laws that regulate the registration of births. In all countries, it is the responsibility of the mother's [[physician]], [[midwife]], hospital administrator, or the parent(s) of the child to see that the birth is properly registered with the appropriate [[government agency]].

The actual record of birth is stored with a government agency. That agency will issue certified copies or representations of the original birth record upon request, which can be used to apply for government benefits, such as [[passports]]. The certification is signed and/or sealed by the registrar or other custodian of birth records, who is commissioned by the government.

The right of every child to a name and nationality, and the responsibility of national governments to achieve this are contained in Articles 7 and 8 in the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]: "The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality..." (CRC Article 7) and "States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations..." (CRC Article 8).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm ''Convention on the Rights of the Child''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |date=11 June 2010 }} (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 1989), accessed 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite 191 countries ratifying the Convention, the births of millions of children worldwide go unregistered. By their very nature, data concerning unregistered children are approximate. About 29% of countries don't have available or sufficient data to assess global progress towards the SDG goal of universal coverage.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|url=http://www.uni.cf/sdgreport|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, from the data that is available, UNICEF estimates that more than a quarter of children under 5 worldwide are unregistered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/birth-registration/ "UNICEF Data – Birth Registration"] (data.unicef.org) accessed 18 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest levels of birth registration are found in sub-Saharan Africa (43 percent). This phenomenon disproportionately impacts poor households and indigenous populations. Even in many developed countries, it contributes to difficulties in fully accessing civic rights.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Gerba, [http://www.altlj.org/index.php?option=Articles&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;artid=69#3 "Making Indigenous Australians 'disappear': Problems arising from our birth registration systems,"] ''Alternative Law Journal'' 34, no. 3 (2009): |157&amp;ndash;162, {{Dead link|date=October 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth registration opens the door to rights to children and adults which many other human beings take for granted: to prove their age; to prove their nationality; to receive healthcare; to go to school; to take exams; to be adopted; to protection from under-age military service or conscription; to marry; to open a bank account; to hold a driving licence; to obtain a passport; to inherit money or property; and to vote or stand for elected office.&lt;ref name="Plan International 2009"&gt;[http://plan-international.org/about-plan/resources/publications/campaigns/count-every-child ''Count Every Child''] (Plan, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons why births go unregistered, including social and cultural beliefs and attitudes; alternative documents and naming ceremonies; remote areas, poor infrastructure; economic barriers; lack of office staff, equipment and training; legal and political restrictions; fear of discrimination and persecution; war, conflict and unrest or simply the fact that there is no system in place.&lt;ref name = "Plan International 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The 'Rights' Start to Life'', (New York: UNICEF).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icn.ch/matters_birth.htm "Fact sheets,"] (International Council of Nurses, 21 May 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF (2007) [http://www.unicef.at/fileadmin/medien/pdf/birth_registration_and_armed_conflict.pdf ''Birth Registration and Armed Conflict,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706095209/http://www.unicef.at/fileadmin/medien/pdf/birth_registration_and_armed_conflict.pdf |date=6 July 2011 }} (Florence: Innocenti Research Centre, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inter-Agency Task Team (IATT) on Children and HIV and AIDS Working Group on Civil Registration, [http://plan-international.org/birthregistration/files/ubr-in-the-context-of-hiv-and-aids-english ''Birth and Death Registration in the Context of HIV and AIDS in Eastern and Southern Africa: Human's First and Last Right''] (Plan, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/search?page=search&amp;docid=4b910bf19&amp;query=birth "Birth Registration: A Topic Proposed for an Executive Committee Conclusion on International Protection,"] (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 9 February 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrospective registration may be necessary where there is a backlog of children whose births have gone unregistered. In Senegal, the government is facilitating retrospective registration through free local court hearings and the number of unregistered children has fallen considerably as a result.
In Sierra Leone, the government gave the National Office of Births and Deaths special permission to issue birth certificates to children over seven. In Bolivia, there was a successful three-year amnesty for the free registration of young people aged between 12 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Heap and Claire Cody, [http://www.fmreview.org/FMRpdfs/FMR32/20-22.pdf "The Universal Birth Registration Campaign,"] ''Forced Migration Review,'' no. 32 (2009): 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statelessness, or the lack of effective nationality, impacts the daily lives of some 11-12 million people around the world. Perhaps those who suffer most are stateless infants, children, and youth. Although born and raised in their parents' country of habitual residence, they lack formal recognition of their existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refintl.org/policy/in-depth-report/futures-denied-statelessness-among-infants-children-and-youth ''Futures Denied: Statelessness Among Infants, Children and Youth''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912145953/http://www.refintl.org/policy/in-depth-report/futures-denied-statelessness-among-infants-children-and-youth |date=12 September 2010 }} (Refugees International, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==

[[File:Birth certificate - Australian Capital Territory.jpg|thumb|upright|Specimen birth certificate issued by the [[Australian Capital Territory]]]]

[[States and territories of Australia]] are responsible for the issuance of birth certificates, through agencies generally titled "Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages" or similar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially registering a birth is done by a hospital through a "Birth Registration Statement" or similar, signed by appropriately licensed and authorized health professionals, and provided to the state or territory registry. Home births are permitted, but a statement is required from a registered midwife, doctor or 2 other witnesses other than the parent(s). Unplanned births require in some states that the baby be taken to a hospital within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/births/births.aspx#Registeringabirth&lt;/ref&gt; Once registered, a separate application (sometimes it can be done along with the Birth Registration Statement) can be made for a birth certificate, generally at a cost. The person(s) named or the parent(s) can apply for a certificate at any time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/births/birth-certificate.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, there is no restriction on re-applying for a certificate at a later date, so it could be possible to legally hold multiple original copies.

The [[Government of Australia|Federal government]] requires that births be also registered through a "Proof of Birth Declaration" similarly signed as above by a doctor or midwife. This ensures the appropriate benefits can be paid, and the child is enrolled for [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/subjects/when-your-baby-born&lt;/ref&gt;

The state or territory issued birth certificate is a secure [[A4 paper]] document, generally listing: Full name at birth, sex at birth, parent(s) and occupation(s), older sibling(s), address(es), date and place of birth, name of the registrar, date of registration, date of issue of certificate, a registration number, with the signature of the registrar and seal of the registry printed and or embossed. Most states allow for stillbirths to be issued a birth certificate. Some states issue early pregnancy loss certificates (without legal significance if before 20 weeks).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/births/stillbirths.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the state or territory, amendment on the certificate are allowed to correct an entry, add ascendant, recognize same-sex relationship,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/births/amend-birth-certificate.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; changing the sex of the holder is also permitted in some state or territory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Documents/apply-for-record-a-change-of-sex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The full birth certificate in Australia is an officially recognized [[Identity documents of Australia|identity document]] generally in the highest category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.humanservices.gov.au/sites/default/files/2016/04/ss231-1604en2.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404221257/https://www.humanservices.gov.au/sites/default/files/2016/04/ss231-1604en2.pdf |archive-date=4 April 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The birth certificate assists in establishing [[Australian nationality law#Citizenship by birth|citizenship]]. Shorter and/or commemorative birth certificates are available; however, they are not generally acceptable for identification purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/apply-for-certificates/commemorative-certificates.aspx#CommemorativeBirthCertificate&lt;/ref&gt;

Birth certificates in Australia can be verified online by approved agencies through the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] Document Verification Service&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dvs.gov.au/How-the-DVS-works/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used to validate [[Digital identity in Australia|identity digitally]], e.g. online.

==Canada==

In Canada, the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the provinces or territories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/subjects/cards/birth_certificate.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies or various ministers are in charge of issuing birth certificates:&lt;ref&gt;
https://www.ontario.ca/en/information_bundle/birthcertificates/119275.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alberta]] - Department of Vital Statistics (Service Alberta)
* [[British Columbia]] - Vital Statistics Agency (Ministry of Health)
* [[Manitoba]] - Vital Statistics Agency (Ministry of Healthy Living, Seniors, and Consumer Affairs/Consumer and Corporate Affairs)
* [[New Brunswick]] - Vital Statistics (Service New Brunswick)
* [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] - Vital Statistics Government Services (Service NL)
* [[Northwest Territories]] - Vital Statistics (Department of Health and Social Services - Health Services Administration Division)
* [[Nova Scotia]] - Registrar General Division of Vital Statistics (Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations)
* [[Nunavut]] - Registrar General of Vital Statistics (Nunavut Health and Social Services)
* [[Ontario]] - Office of Registrar General-Service Ontario (Ministry of Government Services)
* [[Prince Edward Island]] - Vital Statistics (Health and Social Services)
* [[Quebec]] - Director of Civil State (Minister of Justice)
* [[Saskatchewan]] - Vital Statistics-Information Service Corporation (Department of Health)
* [[Yukon]] - Vital Statistics (Ministry of Health and Social Services - Health Services)

===Forms of certified copies issued===

There are three forms of birth certificates issued:

* Copy of an act - contains all information available on the birth of a person.
* Long-form - legal size or two-page form with details of the person, the parent(s), place of birth, certification by the parent(s), signature, and stamp of the issuing agency or department.
* Short form or card - provides name, birth date, place of birth, date of registration, date of issue, registration number, certificate number, and signature of registrar general

Residents of Quebec born elsewhere can have their non-Quebec birth record inserted into Quebec's birth register. Quebec birth certificates issued with regard to a birth, civil union, marriage or death that occurred outside of Quebec are referred to as "semi-authentic" under paragraph 137 of the Civil Code of Québec unless their validity is recognized by a Quebec court. Inserting one's birth record into the Quebec register is a prerequisite for anyone born outside of Quebec to apply for a legal name change in the province. Semi-authentic birth certificates are issued in the long-form only.

===Languages===

Depending on the province, certificates are in English, French or both languages. Birth certificates from Canadian territories are in English and French, as well as Inuktitut in Nunavut (though individual data is in the Roman alphabet only, not in Inuktitut syllabics).

==China==

The People's Republic of China issued its first birth certificate on January 1, 1996. The birth certificate used currently is the fifth edition, which was adopted since January 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification about initiating and standard management of new edition birth medical certificate issued by National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China and the Ministry of Public Security (Chinese)|url=http://www.nhfpc.gov.cn/fys/s3585/201401/9289ca9fc9fc429c995dcf94de4eb740.shtml|publisher=National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, China, the world's most populous country, is among those with no globally comparable data, presenting challenges to researchers who wish to assess global and regional progress towards universal birth registration.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt;

==England and Wales==
[[File:Specimen England and Wales Long Birth Certificate.jpg|thumb|Specimen England and Wales Long Birth Certificate]]
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the description "birth certificate" is used to describe a certified copy of an entry in the birth register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Melanie Lee|title=GRO information on birth certificates in England and Wales|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/56012/response/140909/attach/html/3/Master%20Wild%20Hunt.14.1.11.pdf.html|website=whatdotheyno.com|publisher=General Registre Office|accessdate=7 September 2015|format=pdf|date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in [[England and Wales]] started on 1 July 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Registration in England and Wales|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/civreg|website=genuki.org.uk|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Registration was not compulsory until 1875, following the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1874, which made registration of a birth the responsibility of those present at the birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1874|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/37-38/88/enacted|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a birth is registered, the details are entered into the register book at the local [[register office]] for the district in which the birth took
place and is retained permanently in the local register office. A copy of each entry in the birth register is sent to the [[General Register Office for England and Wales|General Register Office]] (GRO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official information on births, marriages and deaths|url=http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/|website=General Register Office|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-1837 birth and baptism records===
Before the government's registration system was created, evidence of births and/or baptisms (and also marriages and death or burials) was dependent on the events being recorded in the records of the Church of England or in those of other various churches – not all of which maintained such records or all types of those records. Copies of such records are not issued by the General Register Office; but can be obtained from these churches, or from the local or national archive, which usually now keeps the records in original or copy form.

===Types of certified copies issued in England and Wales===
There are two types of birth certificates:

A full certificate, titled 'CERTIFIED COPY OF AN ENTRY' is a copy of the original entry in the birth register, giving all the recorded details.&lt;ref name=Certificate&gt;{{cite web|title=Register a Birth|url=https://www.gov.uk/register-birth/birth-certificates|website=gov.uk|publisher=Government UK|accessdate=8 September 2015|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information includes; name, sex, date, and place of birth of the child, father's name, place of birth and occupation, mother's name, place of birth, maiden name, and occupation. Certificates for births before 1911 do not show the mother's maiden name, before 1969 do not show the detail(s) of the parent(s), place of birth and registration, and before 1984 do not show mother's occupation.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;{{cite web|author1=GRO|title=Information on a birth, marriage or death certificate|url=http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/most_customers_want_to_know.asp#FamilyHistory|website=gro.gov.uk|publisher=Government UK|accessdate=8 September 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short certificate, titled 'CERTIFICATE OF BIRTH', shows the child's full name, sex, date, and place of birth. It does not give any detail(s) of the parent(s); therefore it is not proof of parentage. A short birth certificate is issued, free of charge, at the time of registration.&lt;ref name=Certificate/&gt;

Both versions of a certificate can be used in the verification of identity by acting as a support to other information or documentation
provided. Where proof of parentage is required only a full certificate will be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Treasury Solicitor's Department|title=Proof of Identity checklist for individuals|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/proof-of-identity-checklist/proof-of-identity-checklist#proof-of-identity-checklist-for-individuals|website=gov.uk|publisher=Government UK|accessdate=8 September 2015|date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original registrations are required by law&lt;ref&gt;Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1953, 1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/20/section/1 c. 1], accessed October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to be issued in the form of certified copies to any person who identifies an index entry and pays the prescribed fee. They can be ordered by registered users from the [https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/default.asp General Register Office Certificate Ordering Service] or by postal or telephone ordering from the General Register Office or by post or in person from local registrars. If the birth was registered within the past 50 years detailed information is required before a certificate will be issued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=GRO|title=Ordering a certificate for events which have taken place during the last 50 years|url=http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/most_customers_want_to_know.asp#Delivery7|website=gro.gov.uk|publisher=Government UK|accessdate=8 September 2015|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== India ==
Traditionally births were poorly recorded in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25% of Indian births not registered - Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/25-of-Indian-births-not-registered/articleshow/12104158.cms|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For official purposes, other proofs are accepted in India in lieu of the birth certificate, such as [[matriculation]] certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Passport Seva Application form|url=http://passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/online/faqApplicationForm|website=passportindia.gov.in|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities are available to produce a birth certificate from a passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India Visa Information - Australia - Consular Miscellaneous Services - Issue of Birth Certificate - Basis Indian Passport|url=http://www.vfsglobal.com/india/australia/consular_miscellaneous/issue_of_birth_certificate_basis_indian_passport.html|website=www.vfsglobal.com|accessdate=22 April 2017|quote=Issuance of birth certificate to Indian nationals on the basis of valid Indian passport.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By law since 1969, registration of births is compulsory as per provisions of Registration of Births &amp; Deaths Act.&lt;ref name="delhi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Dte.of Economics &amp; Statistics|url=http://www.delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/DOIT_DES/des/home/facts+about+births+and+deaths+registration/frequently+asked+question|website=www.delhi.gov.in|publisher=Government of NCT of Delhi|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Birth certificates are issued by the [[Government of India]] or the municipality concerned. Specific rules vary by state, region and municipality.

In Delhi, for example, births must be registered within 21 days by the hospital or institution, or by a family member if the birth has taken place at home. After registration, a birth certificate can be obtained by applying to the relevant authority. Certificates can also be issued under special provisions to adopted children, and undocumented orphans. Overseas births can also be registered.&lt;ref name="Delhi" /&gt;

Some municipalities, such as the [[Greater Chennai Corporation]] allow for fully digital birth certificates to be applied for, printed, and verified online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birth Certificates|url=http://chennaicorporation.gov.in/online-civic-services/birthCertificate.do?do=show|website=chennaicorporation.gov.in|publisher=Greater Chennai Corporation|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
[[file:Пример свидетельства о рождении.png|thumb|right|200px|A Russian birth certificate issued in April 2011]]
Earlier testimony was a small book format-bound, now it's just a page format B5, provided with [[watermark]]s. The certificate has a series and number.

The blank insert is made in [[Russian language|Russian]]. In the case of being issued in one of the [[Republics of Russia|country's republics]], its national language form liner can be made in Russian and in the [[Languages of Russia|official language of the Republic]] on the model, approved by the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation]].

===Filling===
A birth certificate can be filled with a handwritten way and with the use of technical equipment (typewriters, computers). When filling in the form is carried handwritten way, all records are made legibly in ink or paste blue or black. If you are using a computer or typewriter dye must be black. The quality of paste, ink, dye, used in completing the documents should ensure the preservation of text documents for a set retention period. When filling out the birth certificate is not allowed to have it in patches, blots, and erasures, cuts.

A birth certificate is signed by the head of the registrar or other public authority issuing the certificate (e.g., the consulate). Signature of the registrar should have a transcript (initials and surname) and sealed with the [[Seal (emblem)|official seal]].

Currently, information about the nationality of the parent(s) is mentioned in the certificate on request. By default, this column is empty

When making a [[Citizenship of Russia|citizenship]], a special insert is issued to the birth certificate. In testimony to Stamp.

February 6, 2007 ear of citizenship were canceled, on the reverse side of the Certificate began to put a stamp on the child's citizenship. This rule applies to newborns or those who change or restores documents.

Old shells are valid for achieving a child 14 years old and to change them is not necessary.

===The procedure for obtaining===
The birth certificate of the child's parent(s) can get (not deprived of parental rights), itself a child of full age, guardian(s) or caregiver(s). Issuance of the document is made in the offices of the registrar, ''ZAGS'' ({{lang-ru|ЗАГС}}).

With the loss of the certificate, a new document is issued by the registry office (ZAGS) in the place of the original receipt on the basis of a written application.

==United States==

{{See also|United States nationality law|Citizenship in the United States|Birthright citizenship in the United States}}
In the U.S., the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the Vital Records Office of the states, capital district, territories&lt;ref&gt;[http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oai-02-86-00001.pdf Birth Certificate Fraud] (Office of Inspector General, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988), iii.&lt;/ref&gt; and former territories.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and [[Philippines]]. [https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/abroad/events-and-records/birth.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Birth in the U.S. establishes automatic eligibility for American citizenship, so a birth certificate from a local authority is commonly provided to the federal government to obtain a [[U.S. passport]].&lt;ref name="CRSReport"&gt;|Margaret Lee, [https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/data/2006/upl-meta-crs-9011/RL33079_2006May12.pdf?PHPSESSID=1ca373c497c7db6a81c7ca74a1445530.pdf ''U.S. Citizenship of Persons Born in the United States to Alien Parents''], Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, (UNT Digital Library, 12 May 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/panelreport_acc.pdf ''Report of the panel to evaluate the standard U.S. certificates''] (Division of Vital Statistics National&amp;mdash; Center for Health Statistics, April 2000, addenda November 2001), 60.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[U.S. State Department]] does issue a Consular Report of Birth Abroad for children born to U.S. citizens (who are also eligible for citizenship), including births on military bases in foreign territory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usa.gov/replace-vital-documents#item-36582 Replace Your Vital Records: Get a Copy of Your Birth Certificate], USA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal and state governments have traditionally cooperated to some extent to improve vital statistics. From 1900 to 1946 the U.S. Census Bureau designed standard birth certificates, collected vital statistics on a national basis, and generally sought to improve the accuracy of vital statistics. In 1946 that responsibility was passed to the [[United States Public Health Service|U.S. Public Health Service]]. Unlike the British system of recording all births in "registers", the states file an individual document for each and every birth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/panelreport_acc.pdf ''Report of the panel to evaluate the standard U.S. certificates''] (Division of Vital Statistics National&amp;mdash; Center for Health Statistics, April 2000, addenda November 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics creates standard forms that are recommended for use by the individual states to document births. However, states are free to create their own forms.&lt;ref name="standard certs"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vital_certificate_revisions.htm ''2003 Revisions of the U.S. Standard Certificates''] (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, last updated 27 April 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, neither the appearance nor the information content of birth certificate forms is uniform across states. These forms are completed by the attendant at birth or a hospital administrator, which are then forwarded to a local or state registrar, who stores the record and issues certified copies upon request.&lt;ref name="handbook"/&gt;

===Types of certified copies issued===
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, {{as of|2000|lc=y}} there were more than 6,000 entities issuing birth certificates. The Inspector General report states that according to the staff at the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]]’s Forensics Document Laboratory the number of legitimate birth certificate versions in use exceeded 14,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oai-02-86-00001.pdf Birth Certificate Fraud] (Office of Inspector General, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Acceptance of short forms====
In the case of applying for a U.S. passport, not all legitimate government-issued birth certificates are acceptable:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A certified birth certificate has a registrar's raised, embossed, impressed or multicolored seal, registrar's signature, and the date the certificate was filed with the registrar's office, which must be within 1 year of your birth. Please note, some short (abstract) versions of birth certificates may '''not''' be acceptable for passport purposes.
&lt;p&gt;Beginning April 1, 2011, all birth certificates must also include the full name of the applicant's parent(s).&lt;ref&gt;[https://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html "First Time Applicants"], US State Department, accessed 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The U.S. State Department has paid close attention to abstract certificates from both Texas and California. There have been reports of a high incidence of midwife registration fraud along the border region between Texas and Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121842058533028907 "They Say They Were Born in the U.S.A.

====Other forms====

Most hospitals in the U.S. issue a souvenir birth certificate which may include the [[Fingerprint#Footprints|footprints]] of the newborn. However, these birth certificates are not legally accepted as proof of age or citizenship, and are frequently rejected by the [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]] during [[United States passport|passport]] applications. Many Americans believe{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} the souvenir records to be their official birth certificates when in reality they hold little legal value.&lt;ref name="ranking"&gt;Bob Rankin, [http://askbobrankin.com/passports_online.html "Passports Online"] on ''Ask Bob Rankin'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth certificates in cases of adoptions====
In the United States, when an adoption is finalized, the government seals the original birth certificate and will issue a replacement birth certificate substituting the individual's birth name with the name selected by the adoptive parent(s), and replacing the birth parent(s) name with the adoptive parent(s). In those cases, adopted individuals are not granted access to their own original birth certificate upon request. Laws vary depending on the state where the birth was originally registered and the adoption was finalized. Some states allow adopted people unrestricted access to their own original birth certificate, while in others the certificate is available only if the biological parent(s) have given their permission or a petition has been granted by the court of jurisdiction. Other jurisdictions do not allow adopted people access to their own original birth certificate under any circumstances. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Sweden==
Birth certificates are no longer issued by the Swedish government, and the only available option is to ask the Swedish Tax Authority for an extract from the Population Register (personbevis), which will specify birthplace, date of birth, and parents, among other information, such as marriage status and current registered address. When a child is born in Sweden, the nurse is obligated to report that to the Swedish Tax Authority, which in turn will issue a [[Personal identity number (Sweden)|Personal identity number]] (personnummer) for the child. This number can then later be used to request the extract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=När barnet är fött|url=http://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/foralder/barnet_fott|publisher=Försäkringskassan|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230011428/http://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/foralder/barnet_fott|archivedate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9261">'''British Library Sounds''' (previously named Archival Sound Recordings) is a [[British Library]] service providing free online access to a diverse range of spoken word, music and environmental sounds from the [[British Library Sound Archive]].  Anyone with web access can use the service to search, browse and listen to 50,000 digitised recordings. Playback and download of an additional 22,000 recordings is available to Athens or Shibboleth users in UK higher and [[further education]]. The service was originally launched with funding by the [[Jisc]].

There are over 20,000 hours of rarely heard audio material available online.  Images and transcripts are also available for some recordings to further enrich the content.

Recordings may be searched by keywords or browsed by collection types, dates, languages, performer names and subjects. Several collections can be browsed using a map interface.

==Content currently available==
The British Library Sounds website covers a broad range of content:

* '''Accents and dialects''' of spoken English, including extracts from the [[Survey of English Dialects]], the Millennium Memory Bank of personal oral histories, the Berliner Lautarchiv of British [[World War I]] prisoners, crowdsourced public contributions of accents, BBC Voices project and a 1940s [[University College London]] phonetics research collection.
* '''Arts, literature and performance''' includes [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], London – Talks, 1981–92 and early spoken-word recordings (including [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Christabel Pankhurst]], [[Winston Churchill]] and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]); and the [[St Mary-le-Bow public debates]].
* '''Classical music''': recordings of Canonical Classical Repertoire 1926-1956 (including all recordings held from the repertoire of [[Bach]], [[Mozart]], [[Haydn]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Brahms]] on 78rpm shellac discs together with early long-playing vinyl discs); a large collection of Chopin performances, and Dutch String Quartet, the London Trio and the [[Philharmonic Quartet]] and other chamber music performers, and experimental music.
* '''Environment and nature''', including hundreds of examples of British wildlife sounds, historic wildlife recordings and amphibians sounds, recordings of East African wildlife, and sounds of weather and urban sounds including the pioneering Soundscapes of Canada collection.
* '''Jazz and popular music''' has skiffle music, interviews of recordings of British jazz musicians and the complete set of programmes from arts broadcaster [[Touch Radio]].
* '''Oral history''' including [[Holocaust]] Survivors' Centre interviews, the collection of [[oral history]] pioneer [[George Ewart Evans]], [[BBC]] Listening Project collection, [[Oral History of British Science]] and collections created by [[National Life Stories]].
* '''Sound recording history''' including scans of rare early record company catalogues, more than 400 images of historic playback equipment and 100 interviews charting the history of [[sound recording]].
* '''World and traditional music''': a wide range of musical styles from around the world. These range from the [[Decca Records]] West Africa "Yellow Label" Series and [[music of India]] collected by [[ethnomusicologist]] Rolf Killius to Traditional Music in [[England]], a vast collection of 20,000 recordings of popular ballads, [[children's skipping songs]], customs, [[music hall]], soldiers' songs, folk tales and interviews.

==Selected highlights==

'''African Writers' Club'''

Over 250 hours of radio programmes about African literary, social and cultural affairs. Made at the Transcription Centre in [[London]], the recordings were broadcast throughout [[Africa]] and sometimes on the [[BBC World Service]]. Ranging from radio dramas to magazine programmes, from politics to poetry, this collection provides a view of Africa in the mid-1960s.

'''Art and design interviews'''

Intimate encounters with the life and work of British painters, sculptors, photographers and architects. Interviewees include sculptors [[Elisabeth Frink]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]]; painters [[Terry Frost]], [[Paula Rego]] and [[Michael Rothenstein]]; photographers [[Grace Robertson]], [[Mari Mahr]] and [[Helen Chadwick]]; and architects [[Denys Lasdun]], [[Ralph Erskine (architect)|Ralph Erskine]], Edward Hollamby and Patrick Gwynne. 

'''David Rycroft Africa recordings'''

South African-born linguist and musicologist, Rycroft made many field trips to villages, townships and settlements around [[South Africa]] between the 1960s and '80s. Fascinated by the relationship between oral traditions and musical structure, Rycroft focused on unaccompanied choral singing, songs composed for indigenous musical instruments, and urban music. 

'''Klaus Wachsmann Uganda recordings'''

[[Klaus Wachsmann]] made roughly 1,500 unique recordings of indigenous music in [[Uganda]], most of which have never been published before. This collection dates from the late 1940s, when Wachsmann was curator of the Uganda Museum in [[Kampala]], and includes field recordings and performances at the museum.

'''Oral history of jazz in Britain'''

An informal and anecdotal history of the music, venues and people that defined [[jazz]] in the UK. Through interviews with musicians, promoters and label owners, this collection focuses on some of the less well known aspects of [[British jazz]] – including the impact in Britain of overseas musicians, British developments in free improvisation in the 1960s, jazz outside London, and the contribution of women to the music.

'''Oral history of recorded sound'''

This teaching package reflects in sound, image and text the cultural and economic impact of developments in recording technology over the 20th century. It also features oral history interviews with significant figures in the worlds of music, radio, and the recording industry – with a focus on backroom innovators who have rarely enjoyed the limelight.

'''Sound Maps'''

A series of interactive maps allowing browsing and listening of accents and dialects, nature sounds, oral memories and traditional music.

'''Soundscapes'''

The word "''[[soundscape]]''" was coined by composer [[R. Murray Schafer]] to identify sounds that “describe a place, a sonic identity, a sonic memory, but always a sound that is pertinent to a place”&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, Gregg (2000) "From the Isles of Lewis and Harris", ''Soundscape, The Journal of Acoustic Ecology'', 1/1, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This selection draws together mechanical and industrial sounds (including transport and fog-horns), soundscapes of the natural world across continents, urban soundscapes, and wildlife sounds from around the globe. 

'''[[St Mary-le-Bow public debates]]'''

At one o’clock every Tuesday lunchtime for fifteen years (1964–79), Joseph McCulloch, the Rector of [[St Mary-le-Bow|St Mary-le-Bow Church]] in the City of London, invited a well-known public figure to debate an issue of the day. Popular among city workers, guests included [[Enoch Powell]] on race, [[Diana Rigg]] on single parentage, [[A. J. Ayer]] on moral responsibility, [[Edna O'Brien|Edna O’Brien]] on fear, and [[Germaine Greer]] on free will.

'''Syliphone record label recordings from Guinea'''

Over 7,800 recordings of music from Guinea, originally released on the Syliphone record label. It includes many unique recordings not previously heard outside of Guinea. A large proportion has not been broadcast in over 20 years, as it was politically sensitive and subject to censorship. The list of artists and musicians represented in the collection is a who’s who of Guinean and African music. There are many unreleased recordings by major stars such as Kandia Sory Kouyaté, Bembeya Jazz National, Fodé Conté, and Kadé Diawara, in addition to hundreds of unreleased recordings by Guinea’s national and regional orchestras, troupes and ensembles. There is also a wealth of material by famous Guinean artists who, as they were never commercially recorded, are virtually unknown outside of Guinea, including Farba Tela (an inspiration to Ali Farka Touré), Mama Kanté, Binta Laaly Sow, Koubia Jazz, and Jeanne Macauley. The collection also features thousands of traditional songs from all of Guinea’s regions and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/endangeredarchives/2013/06/syliphone-label-music.html "Syliphone - an early recording label from Guinea"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Indonesia}}
'''Buni culture''' is a prehistoric [[clay pottery]] culture that flourished in coastal northern [[West Java]],  [[Jakarta]] and [[Banten]] around 400 BC to 100 AD &lt;ref name="Zahorka-2007"&gt;
{{cite book| last = Zahorka| first = Herwig| publisher = Yayasan cipta Loka Caraka| title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with Royal Center of Bogor, Over 1000 Years of Propsperity and Glory| date =| year = 2007| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and probably survived until 500 AD. The culture was named after its first discovered archaeological site, Buni village in Babelan, [[Bekasi]], east of [[Jakarta]]. 

Buni culture is known for its peculiar pottery with incised, geometrical decorations, and the fact that it yielded the first Indian rouletted wares recorded from Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9xVZbxWNo40C&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=Buni+culture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BJRSkyxECV&amp;sig=roN4-usaQw3A5PBmWw7DWlech2k&amp;hl=id&amp;ei=uOxDTvTACILRrQeplOy9AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Buni%20culture&amp;f=false | author = Manguin, Pierre-Yves and Agustijanto Indrajaya | title = The Archaeology of Batujaya (West Java, Indonesia):an Interim Report, in Uncovering Southeast Asia's past}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay potteries were later developed with evidence found in [[Anyer]] to [[Cirebon]]. Artifacts such as food and drink containers, dated from 400&amp;nbsp;BC to AD 100 have been found, mostly as burial gifts.&lt;ref name="Zahorka-2007" /&gt;

Buni clay pottery culture bears similarities with [[Sa Huỳnh culture]] in [[Vietnam]]. [[Pottery]] artefacts were discovered such as clay dishes, pots, water jars and other daily utensils. [[Megalithic]] culture can also be found, such as beads as burial gifts, and also [[menhir]] and stone table. The people that supported Buni culture had established trade with foreign people, and the kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]] is probably the successor of Buni culture after the adoption of [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hinduism]]. The remnants of Buni pottery have also been discovered at the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site]] and the Kendaljaya site in [[Karawang]].

He also known as Cikgu Buyong.(Teacher Buyong)

==Biography==
===Education and Career===
Yusuf bin Adil, better known as Buyong Adil, was born in January 1907 at Teluk Intan, [[Perak]]. He received his early education at Sekolah Melayu Teluk Anson and later entered the Kolej Latihan Sultan Idris (SITC), [[Tanjung Malim]] in 1924. He was the best student at SITC and became a lecturer there after graduating. He began to write on history after his teacher, Cikgu Abdul Hadi Hassan, shifted to [[Kelantan]]. In 1939, Buyong Adil wrote Sejarah Alam Melayu Penggal IV and Sejarah Melayu V.

During the [[Japan]]ese occupation, he was selected to undergo Japanese teacher training at the Tokyo Shihan Gakko which is located in [[Kajang]], [[Selangor]].

After the Japanese occupation ended, he was appointed as a headmaster in a school in [[Ipoh]]. During this time, he started being actively involved in the Perak Malay Coalition (Perikatan Melayu Perak). This led to the [[United Kingdom|British]] appointing him as the head for the radio station for all the [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] schools in [[Singapore]] (which was at that time still a part of Malaysia). He also directed his first play after the Japanese occupation. 'Megat Terawis' was staged mainly for the teachers and their family members. Later, he became the historical advisor for Tan Sri P Ramlee's first movie to be shown in colour: 'Hang Tuah'.&lt;ref&gt;http://seniman-pramlee.tripod.com/hangtuah.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from the government in 1962, he was chosen as a member of Singapore's Public Services Commission (Perkhidmatan Awam Singapura) from 1963 until 1969. During that time, he managed to write Sejarah Johor, Sejarah Selangor, Sejarah Perak and Sejarah Pahang. He also assisted Tan Sri Senu Abdul Rahman in collecting materials for the book Revolusi Mental in 1970.

In 1971, he started work at [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] (DBP) as a research officer for history. This was when he began to write his other books such as Sejarah Sarawak, Sejarah Perlis, Sejarah Negeri Sembilan, Sejarah Melaka, Sejarah Kedah, Sejarah Terengganu and Sejarah Kelantan which were published by DBP. He died on August 31, 1976.

The Government English Secondary School (GESS) in [[Tapah]] was renamed as SM Buyong Adil Tapah in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[[:ms:Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Buyong Adil]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and Family===
Buyong Adil married at the age of 22. His wife, Halimah binti Mohd Daim, was from [[Gopeng]], Perak. She died in April 2005. They had 2 sons and 3 daughters.

[[File:ChesterMysteryPlay 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Engraving depicting an early Chester Mystery Play]]

The '''Chester Mystery Plays''' is a [[play cycle|cycle]] of [[mystery play]]s originating in the city of [[Chester]], England and dating back to at least the early part of the 15th century.

==History==
A record of 1422 shows that the plays took place at the feast of [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] and this appears to have continued until 1521. Plays on Corpus Christi Day in 1475 included 'The trial and flagellation of Christ' and 'The Crucifixion'. The plays were then expanded into a three-day cycle on Whit Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. In the years between the plays there was the [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]] instead.

The plays are based on biblical texts, from [[Creation myth|creation]] to the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]]. They were enacted by common [[guild]]smen and [[artisan|craftsmen]] on mounted stages that were moved around the city streets, with each company or guild performing one play.

Prior to the event the Crier read out these banns: "The Aldermen and stewards of evrie societie and Companie draw youselves to your said severall companies according to Ancient Customme and soe to appear with your said severall Companies everie man as you are Called upon paine that shall fall thereon". Such early banns exhorted each company to perform well.

Under Queen Elizabeth I the plays were seen as '[[Popery]]' and banned by the [[Church of England|English Church]]. Despite this a play cycle was performed in 1568 and the cathedral paid for the stage and beer as in 1562. They were performed again, over four days, in 1575. This resulted in the mayor, when he retired from his office, being taken to the [[Star Chamber]] in London to answer allegations against him, but with the support of the council (or assembly) he was freed.

One edition of the plays begins with "The [[wiktionary:banns|Banes]] which are reade beefore the beginninge of the playes of Chester, 4 June, 1600". Each play ends with "Finis. Deo gracias! per me Georgi Bellin. 1592". &lt;ref&gt;

The most well-known of the Chester plays relates the story of [[Noah]] and the [[Deluge (mythology)#Hebrew|Great Flood]], traditionally acted by the Drawers of Dee ([[Barge hauler|watercarriers]]). In it, Noah and his sons load up the provisions and the animals while his wife gossips with the neighbours. Noah urges her to hurry aboard, "''The flood comes in fleeting fast; On every side it speadeth full fare; For fear of drowning I am agast; Good gossip, let us draw near"''. But Noah's wife keeps on drinking and gossipping until, eventually, the sons carry her onto the ark by force. At the end of the play, God provides a rainbow as a token that mankind has had enough punishment for its sinful deeds.

The plays were revived in Chester in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]] and are presented there every five years.&lt;ref name=cmp&gt;[http://www.chestermysteryplays.com/history/history/morehistory.html Chester Mystery Plays website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714094749/http://www.chestermysteryplays.com/history/history/morehistory.html |date=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2018 run of plays was from 27 June to 14 July.

The Players of St Peter have been performing the plays in London roughly every five years since 1946.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theplayersofstpeter.org.uk/apps/history.php The Players of St Peter] who will be performing two of the plays in early December 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the direction of Dr. Jeff Dailey, the American Theatre of Actors in New York City performed the penultimate play, "The Coming of Antichrist," in August, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://terryvprideaux.wixsite.com/antichrist American Theatre of Actors]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In the 20th century, the Noah's Flood play was set [[opera]]tically by both [[Benjamin Britten]] (''[[Noye's Fludde]]'') and [[Igor Stravinsky]] (''[[The Flood (Stravinsky)|The Flood]]'').

''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'' is an adaption by the poet [[Tony Harrison]], principally based upon the [[Wakefield Cycle]], but incorporating scenes from the [[York Mystery Plays|York]], Chester and [[N-Town Plays|N-Town]] canons, first performed in 1977 at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], and again revived in 2000 as a celebration of the millennium.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3834">'''Chrétien Le Clercq, [[Recollects|O.M.R.]]''', (born 1641) was a [[Recollects|Recollect]] Franciscan friar and [[missionary]] to the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] on the [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] peninsula of Canada in the mid-17th century. He was a chronicler of [[New France]], who wrote two early histories, and translator of a [[First Nations|Native American]] language of that region, adapting an apparently indigenous [[mnemonic]] glyph system into a writing system known as [[Míkmaq hieroglyphic writing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Chrestien Leclercq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
A [[French Flanders|Fleming]] by birth, Le Clercq joined the Recollect [[ecclesiastical province|Province]] of St. [[Anthony of Padua|Anthony]], based in [[Artois]]. He was sent to the missions of the [[French colonial empire]] in Canada in 1673. On 11 October of that year, he was put in charge of the Micmac mission by [[Francois de Laval]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]]. There he learned the language of that tribe and devoted himself to its evangelization. In 1676 he tried to persuade the Micmacs that it would be more advantageous to build houses in the French manner, which earned him a stunning rebuke from the Micmac Chief.&lt;ref name="Ref-12"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z98Upq-rkrsC&amp;dq=first+peoples,+first+voices+penny+petrone&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Penny Petrone, ''First People, First Voices''], University of Toronto Press: (1984), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; 

Le Clercq's superiors sent him back to France in 1680 on business connected with the Franciscan missions in Canada. He returned the following spring with letters authorizing the foundation of a friary in [[Montreal]], where he went during the summer of 1681 to carry out this work. In November he returned to the Micmac mission, where he spent the next twelve years. 

In autumn 1686 Le Clercq left Canada permanently and returned to France, where he filled various positions of authority in the Artois Province of his Order. The date of his death is unknown, but he was still living in 1698. After his return to France, he completed two works which he published at Paris in 1691. An English translation of one of these works, ''Nouvelle Relation de la Gaspesie'', was provided by [[William Francis Ganong|William F. Ganong]] in 1910 as part of the [[Champlain Society|Champlain Society's]] General Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = New Relation of Gaspesia, with the Customs and Religion of the Gaspesian Indians: The Publications of the Champlain Society|url = http://champlainsociety.utpjournals.press/doi/book/10.3138/9781442618213|doi = 10.3138/9781442618213|first = Father Chrestien|last = Le Clercq|editor-first = William|editor-last = Ganong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dana Hudkins Crawford''' (born 1931) is an American [[conservation architect|architectural conservation]] developer and [[preservationist]] working in [[Denver]], Colorado. She has been involved in almost every renovation project in downtown Denver, from the initial designation of the LoDo District and creation of Larimer Square to the Union Station. She was recognized by her alma mater, [[Radcliffe College]], for the Larimer Square project, was inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame, and in 2013 the hotel at the restoration project of Union Station was renamed as the Crawford Hotel in honor of her contributions to preserve the history of Denver.

==Biography==
Dana Hudkins was born on July 22, 1931 in [[Salina, Kansas]]. She graduated from [[Monticello College]] and then went on to complete her undergraduate degree at the [[University of Kansas]]{{sfn|Varnell|Hanson|1999|p=225}} in 1953. From there, she enrolled in [[Radcliffe College]] and studied Business Administration, graduating in 1954.&lt;ref name="Harvard Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Radcliffe Alumnae Recognition Awards|url=http://via.lib.harvard.edu/via/deliver/deepcontentItem?recordId=olvgroup11728%2CRAD.ARCH%3A1147681|publisher=Harvard Library|accessdate=19 October 2015|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she moved to Denver, Colorado and began working in a public relations firm.&lt;ref name="Business Journal"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Paula|title=Legacy Award: Dana Crawford respected as a ‘placemaker’|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/print-edition/2014/06/13/dana-crawford-respected-as-a-placemaker.html|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=Denver Business Journal|date=June 19, 2014|location=Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, she married a geologist, John W. R. Crawford III, and they subsequently had four sons.{{sfn|Varnell|Hanson|1999|p=225}}

In the early 1960s, when the [[LoDo, Denver|Lower Downtown]] (LoDo) area of the 1400 block of Larimer Street was being proposed for demolition, Crawford organized a group of investors to buy the property for a potential retail redevelopment project.&lt;ref name="Business Journal" /&gt; They formed an organization called [[Historic Denver, Inc.]] with the goal of preserving Denver's architectural heritage and save the [[Molly Brown House]]. There was strong opposition to the preservation movement from the Denver Urban Renewal Authority{{sfn|Varnell|Hanson|1999|p=226}} as well as community opposition from those who thought that designating the area as a preservation district would limit new development in the area.&lt;ref name="Business Journal" /&gt; Finding financing was another hurdle, as many banks did not want to lend to a woman. She surmounted the problem by obtaining financing from the [[New York Life Insurance Company]].{{sfn|Varnell|Hanson|1999|p=226}} After about 10 years of planning, in 1971, Denver's first Historic District, Larimer Square, was launched.&lt;ref name="Business Journal" /&gt; She received a Radcliffe Alumnae Recognition Award for her successful development of Larimer Square.&lt;ref name="Harvard Library" /&gt;

After completing the Larimer Square project, Crawford started work on [[Union Station, Denver (neighborhood)|Union Station neighborhood]] but worked alone for nearly 30 years.&lt;ref name="Business Journal" /&gt; In the interim, she worked on preservation of the [[Oxford Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Oxford Hotel]], LoDo's Millennium retail office project, two Flour Mill Loft redevelopment ventures,&lt;ref name=Projects&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sinisi|first1=J. Sebastian|title=Crawford still an urban pioneer|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/profile0110.htm|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=Denver Post|date=January 10, 2000|location=Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ice House, Coors Field, and others. In 1996, she was inducted into the [[Colorado Women's Hall of Fame]] for her preservation&lt;ref name="Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dana Crawford|url=http://www.cogreatwomen.org/project/dana-crawford/|publisher=Colorado Great Women|accessdate=20 October 2015|location=Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; and development of downtown Denver. The Flour Mill Loft Project, completed in 1999,&lt;ref name=HomeDsgn&gt;{{cite news|title=Stunning Loft in a Former Flour Mill in Denver|url=http://www.homedsgn.com/2011/09/30/stunning-loft-in-a-former-flour-mill-in-denver/|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=HomeDsgn|date=September 30, 2011|location=Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was one of Crawford's personal favorites, as it was "the first residential project in the Platte Valley".&lt;ref name="Union Station"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rinaldi|first1=Ray Mark|title=Denver developer Dana Crawford continues to take on big projects|url=http://www.denverpost.com/lifestyles/ci_24605169/denver-developer-dana-crawford-continues-take-big-projects|accessdate=19 October 2015|publisher=The Denver Post|date=November 26, 2013|location=Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008, several investors got together and a plan was formed to design, finance and build a transit system linked to [[Union Station (Denver, Colorado)|Union Station]]. The station itself was accepting proposals and Crawford put together a team, which they called the Union Station Alliance, to make a bid. They won the project in December 2011 and a 99-year lease on the station and set about obtaining approval from the [[National Park Service]] to make alterations to the historic site. After a year, approval was attained, the consortium changed equity partners and the development got underway.&lt;ref name="new parntership"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaffe|first1=Mark|title=Denver's renovated Union Station has been a 30-year barn-raising|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_26139214/denvers-renovated-union-station-has-been-30-year|accessdate=20 October 2015|publisher=The Denver Post|date=July 13, 2014|location=Denver,  Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the hotel within Union Station, was renamed the Crawford Hotel in Crawford's honor as a way to recognize her contributions to the revitalization of downtown Denver.&lt;ref name="Crawford Hotel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Svaldi|first1=Aldo|title=Crawford Hotel will put flesh on old bones of Union Station|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_24515079/crawford-hotel-will-put-flesh-old-bones-union|accessdate=20 October 2015|publisher=The Denver Post|date=November 13, 2013|location=Denver, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Desert Uniforms, Patches, and Insignia of the US Armed Forces''''' is a comprehensive reference book that provides a detailed study of desert uniforms, patches, and insignia worn by the US Armed Forces in combat from Desert Storm, through Somalia and in the campaigns of Iraq and Afghanistan.

==Content==

The book is the definitive reference of desert combat uniforms, patches and insignia worn by the US Armed Forces in Desert Storm, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. It covers information on US Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard desert uniforms and patches. Its detailed research is designed to provide a reference for veterans, historians, collectors and reenactors.  &lt;ref&gt;Book Review of Desert Uniforms, Patches, and Insignia of the US Armed Forces, by Military Trader Magazine, March 2017, &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The March 2017 issue of the Military Trader Magazine stated that, "While the term 'bible' is thrown around rather loosely in our hobby 'definitive' retains its significance as an expression of honor and endorsement. I do not hesitate to say ''Desert Uniforms, Patches, and Insignia of the US Armed Forces'' by Born and Barns is the ''definitive'' volume for anyone who is collecting the shortest-lived - but some of the most distinctive  - uniforms in U.S. military history.  Not only is it a stand alone reference for the collector and historian, it is also a tribute to the men and women of the US Armed Forces during this chaotic time in history.   &lt;ref&gt;Book Review of Desert Uniforms, Patches, and Insignia of the US Armed Forces, by Military Trader Magazine, March 2017, &lt;/ref&gt;

The Trading Post, the quarterly journal of the American Society of Military Insignia Collectors described the book as, "a roadmap of those changes that will be an invaluable guide to the collector of uniforms and insignia from this somewhat unappreciated era in our military history... I highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in collecting militaria of the last thirty or so years"  &lt;ref&gt;Book Review of Desert Uniforms, Patches, and Insignia of the US Armed Forces 1st Edition, by Dave Johnson, July-September 2017, Trading Post, American Society of Military Insignia Collectors&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fort Lee Traveller Newspaper reported that, "In preparation for the book, they accumulated more than 1,000 government and theater-made desert patches and over 300 uniforms. A large number are in it. These came from numerous veterans and collectors...Born said, “writing the book was about two things for us – recognizing the service and sacrifice of the men and women of the armed forces who wore the desert uniform as well as advancing this area of military collecting. Whenever a reference like this is published, there is an increased interest among collectors.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.militarynews.com/fort-lee-traveller/news/local_news/employee-retiree-share-history-passion-in-u-s-military-desert/article_a4ec996e-ff51-11e6-bd6f-a7a0a76033e1.html  Employee, retiree share history passion in U.S. military desert uniform book, Ray Kozakewicz, Production Assistant, Fort Lee Traveller Newspaper, 2 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australian Aboriginal art]], a '''Dreaming''' is  a totemistic design or artwork, which can be owned by a tribal group or individual. 
This usage of Stanner's term was popularised by [[Geoffrey Bardon]] in the context of the [[Papunya Tula]] artist collective he established in the 1970s.

==Terminology==
{{main|Dreamtime}}
"[[Dreamtime]]" is commonly used as a term  for the [[animist]] creation narrative of [[indigenous Australians]] for a personal, or group, [[Creation myth|creation]] and for what may be understood as the "timeless time" of formative creation and perpetual creating. In addition, the term applies to places and localities on indigenous Australian traditional land (and throughout non-traditional Australia) where the uncreated creation spirits and [[totem]]ic ancestors, or ''[[genius loci|genii loci]]'', reside.&lt;ref&gt;Kimber, R. G., ''Man from Arltunga'', Hesperian Press, Carlisle, Western Australia, 1986, chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt;  
The term was coined by [[W. E. H. Stanner]] in 1956, and popularized from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.H Stanner, "The dreaming" in T.A.G. Hungerford (ed.), ''Australian Signpost'', (1956); W.E.H Stanner, ''The Australian Aboriginal Dreaming as an Ideological System'' (1963)&lt;/ref&gt; based on the description of indigenous Australian mythology by Lucien Levy-Bruhl (''La Mythologie Primitive'', 1935).&lt;ref&gt;"the ''religious symbol system'' at the primitive level is characterized by Lévy-Bruhl as "''le monde mythique''", and Stanner directly translates the Australians' own word for it as 'the Dreaming'." R. N. Bellah, "Religious Evolution" in:  S. N. Eisenstadt (ed.), ''Readings in Social Evolution and Development'', Elsevier, 2013 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=LkttBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220 p. 220].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Dreaming" is based on the root of the term ''altjira'' (''alcheringa'') used by the  [[Aranda people]], although it has since been pointed out that the rendition is based on a mistranslation.&lt;ref&gt;B. Kilborne, "On classifying dreams", in: Barbara Tedlock (ed.) ''Dreaming: Anthropological and Psychological Interpretations'', 1987, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eRk9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249 p. 249].
Tony Swain, ''Place for Strangers: Towards a History of Australian Aboriginal Being'',  Cambridge University Press, 1993, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=B040KquZAEIC&amp;pg=PA21 p. 21].&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanner introduced the derived term of "[[dreamtime]]" in the 1970s.

==Contemporary Indigenous Australian art==
{{main|Contemporary Indigenous Australian art}}
{{see|Papunya Tula}}

"A Dreaming" is a story owned by different tribes and their members that explains the creation of life, people and animals. A Dreaming story is passed on protectively as it is owned and is a form of "[[intellectual property]]". In the modern context, an Aborigine cannot relate, or paint someone else's dreaming or creation story without prior permission of the Dreaming's owner.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Someone's dreaming story must be respected, as the individual holds the knowledge to that Dreaming story.  Certain behavioural constraints are associated with dreaming ownership; for instance, if a Dreaming is painted without authorisation, such action can meet with accusations of "stealing" someone else's Dreaming. [[Geoffrey Bardon]]'s three books on [[Papunya]] (1971, 1976, 1978) specifically mention conflict related to possession of a dreaming story.  He uses as an example the [[Honey Ant]] Dreaming painted in contemporary times on the school walls of Papunya.  Before the [[mural]] could be painted, all tribes in Papunya: the ''[[Pintupi]]'', ''[[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]]'', ''[[Arrernte people|Arrernte]]'', and ''[[Anmatyerre]]'', had to agree that the honey ant was an acceptable mural, since Papunya is the meeting place for all tribes.  After the mural was painted, one of the senior [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s, Long Tom Onion, reminded Bardon that he, the elder, had suggested the mural be painted.  Later, Bardon realised Long Tom Onion owned that Dreaming.  He comprehended the importance of Dreaming ownership among indigenous Australians, especially those who retain tribal and traditional connections.

Among the [[Central Desert]] tribes of Australia, the passing on of the Dreaming story is for the most part [[gender]]-related.  For example, the late artist from the Papunya movement, [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]], painted ceremonial dreamings relating to [[circumcision]] and love stories, and lessons for "naughty boys".  His daughters Gabriella Possum and Michelle Possum have tended to paint the [[Australian Aboriginal astronomy|"Seven Sisters" Dreaming]] or the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]], as they inherited that Dreaming through the maternal line.  Consequently, they have painted their "Grandmother's Country", which is an expression of their inherited ownership of the land through knowledge of the dreamings.  Clifford and his daughters have not painted the same subjects; Clifford has never painted the "Seven Sisters Dreaming".  By tribal law, his daughters are not allowed to see male tribal ceremonies, let alone paint them.

Dreamings as "property" have also been used by a few Aboriginal tribes to argue before the [[High Court of Australia]] their title over traditional tribal land.  Paintings of Dreamings, travelling journeys and ceremonies tend to depict the locations where they occur.  There have been cases in which 10-metre-long paintings have been presented to the Court, as evidence of the tribe's [[title deed]] after ''[[terra nullius]]'' was struck down during the tenure of Chief Justice [[Gerard Brennan]].

'''Francesco Angeloni''' (after 1559 – 29 November 1652) was an Italian writer, [[antiquary]], historian and collector of a wide range of objects including classical antiquities and drawings.

Born in [[Terni]] in [[Umbria]]—a region of [[Italy]] at that time part of the [[Papal States]]—he studied in [[Perugia]] then moved to [[Rome]], where he served as secretary of cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini, later Pope [[Clement VIII]] (d. 1605), and for a time as chief [[notary]] to the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Spart&lt;/ref&gt;

Angeloni dedicated most of his life in collecting antique coins, medallions, books, paintings, and archaeological artifacts and achieved fame in Europe with the publication in 1641 of his edition of the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'', a history of ancient Rome since [[Julius Caesar]] to [[Constantine the Great]], illustrated with antique coins of the times: ''Historia Augusta da Giulio Cesare infino a Costantino il Magno illustrata con la verità delle antiche medaglie'' (1641, with a second edition edited by Bellori in 1685). He also wrote comedies and 38 [[novel|''noveli'']] and a ''Storia di Terni'' (1646), a history of his hometown.&lt;ref&gt;Spart&lt;/ref&gt;

In his house on the [[Pincio]] hill, from 1634 Angeloni raised and educated his nephew [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]], who became a well-known biographer of artists, antiquarian and archaeologist. Angeloni left his collections to Bellori on condition they were kept intact, but the family contested the will and Bellori only received the house, with the collections being dispersed. His collections were large and diverse, but included some 600 drawings by his friend [[Annibale Carracci]], a large library, and the diverse range of objects typical of the contemporary [[cabinet of curiosities]], but on an unusually large scale.  He left a manuscript catalogue. [[Giovanni Battista Agucchi]] and Camillo Massimi (uncle of [[Camillo Massimo|the cardinal of the same name]]) were particular friends.&lt;ref&gt;Spart; Fletcher, 664–666&lt;/ref&gt;

'''François-René, vicomte de Chateaubriand''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|æ|ˌ|t|oʊ|b|r|iː|ˈ|ɑː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/f+chateaubriand "Chateaubriand"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|fʁɑ̃swa ʁəne də ʃɑtobʁijɑ̃|lang}}; 4 September 1768 – 4 July 1848), was a French writer, [[France during the 19th century|politician, diplomat]] and historian who founded [[Romanticism]] in [[French literature]]. Descended from an old aristocratic family from [[Brittany]], Chateaubriand was a [[royalist]] by political disposition. In an age when a number of intellectuals turned against the Church, he authored the ''[[The Genius of Christianity|Génie du christianisme]]'' in defense of the [[Catholic faith]]. His works include the autobiography ''[[Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' ("''Memoirs from Beyond the Grave''"), published posthumously in 1849–1850. 

Historian [[Peter Gay]] says that Chateaubriand saw himself as the greatest lover, the greatest writer, and the greatest philosopher of his age. Gay states that Chateaubriand "dominated the literary scene in France in the first half of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, "The Complete Romantic," ''Horizon'' (1966) 8#2 pp 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early years and exile ===
[[File:Combourg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[château de Combourg]], where Chateaubriand spent his childhood]]

Born in [[Saint-Malo]], the last of ten children, Chateaubriand grew up at his family's castle (the [[château de Combourg]]) in [[Combourg]], Brittany. His father, René de Chateaubriand (1718–86), was a former sea captain turned ship owner and slave trader. His mother's maiden name was Apolline de Bedée. Chateaubriand's father was a morose, uncommunicative man, and the young Chateaubriand grew up in an atmosphere of gloomy solitude, only broken by long walks in the Breton countryside and an intense friendship with his sister Lucile. His youthful solitude and wild desire produced a suicide attempt with a hunting rifle, although the weapon failed to discharge.

Chateaubriand was educated in [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]], [[Rennes]] and [[Dinan]]. For a time he could not make up his mind whether he wanted to be a naval officer or a priest, but at the age of seventeen, he decided on a military career and gained a commission as a second lieutenant in the French Army based at [[Navarre]]. Within two years, he had been promoted to the rank of [[Captain (Land)|captain]]. He visited Paris in 1788 where he made the acquaintance of [[Jean-François de La Harpe]], [[André Chénier]], [[Louis-Marcelin de Fontanes]] and other leading writers of the time. When the [[French Revolution]] broke out, Chateaubriand was initially sympathetic, but as events in Paris became more violent he decided to journey to North America in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dialjournallitcrit65chicrich#page/16/mode/2up Nitze, William A.] "Chateaubriand in America", The Dial, Vol. LXV, June–December 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; He was given the idea to leave Europe by Chrétien-Guillaume de Lamoigon de Malesherbes, who also encouraged him to do some botanical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Tapié, V.-L. (1965) Chateaubriand. Seuil.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journey to America ===
[[File:François-René de Chateaubriand by Anne-Louis Girodet de Roucy Trioson.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Young Chateaubriand, by [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Anne-Louis Girodet]] (c. 1790)]]
In ''Voyage en Amérique'', published in 1826, Chateaubriand writes that he arrived in Philadelphia on 10 July 1791. He visited New York, Boston and Lexington, before leaving by boat on the Hudson River to reach Albany.&lt;ref name="Chateaubriand_1826"&gt;Chateaubriand, F-R. (1826) Voyage en Amérique&lt;/ref&gt; He then followed the Mohawk trail up the Niagara Falls where he broke his arm and spent a month in recovery in the company of a Native American tribe. Chateaubriand then describes Native American tribes' customs, as well as zoological, political and economic consideration. He then says that a raid along the Ohio River, the Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida took him back to Philadelphia, where he embarked on the ''Molly'' in November to go back to France.&lt;ref name="Chateaubriand_1826"/&gt;

This experience provided the setting for his exotic novels ''[[Les Natchez]]'' (written between 1793 and 1799 but published only in 1826), ''[[Atala (novella)|Atala]]'' (1801) and ''[[René (novella)|René]]'' (1802). His vivid, captivating descriptions of nature in the sparsely settled American [[Deep South]] were written in a style that was very innovative for the time and spearheaded what later became the Romantic movement in France. As early as 1916,&lt;ref&gt;Lebègue, R. (1965) Le problème du voyage de Chateaubriand en Amérique. Journal des Savants, 1,1 from http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jds_0021-8103_1965_num_1_1_1104&lt;/ref&gt; scholarship has cast doubt on Chateaubriand's claims that he was granted an interview with [[George Washington]] and that he actually lived for a time with the Native Americans he wrote about. Critics have questioned the veracity of entire sections of Chateaubriand's claimed travels, notably his passage through the [[Mississippi Valley]], Louisiana and Florida.

=== Return to France ===
Chateaubriand returned to France in 1792 and subsequently joined the army of [[House of Bourbon|Royalist]] ''[[émigré]]s'' in [[Koblenz]] under the leadership of [[Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé|Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Condé]]. Under strong pressure from his family, he married a young aristocratic woman, also from Saint-Malo, whom he had never previously met, Céleste Buisson de la Vigne. In later life, Chateaubriand was notoriously unfaithful to her, having a series of love affairs. His military career came to an end when he was wounded at the siege of [[Thionville]], a major clash between Royalist troops and the [[French Revolutionary Army]]. Half-dead, he was taken to [[Jersey]] and exiled to England, leaving his wife behind.

=== Exile in London ===
Chateaubriand spent most of his exile in extreme poverty in London, scraping a living offering French lessons and doing translation work, but a stay in [[Suffolk]] ([[Beccles]]) was more idyllic. Here Chateaubriand fell in love with a young English woman, Charlotte Ives, but the romance ended when he was forced to reveal he was already married. During his time in Britain, Chateaubriand also became familiar with [[English literature]]. This reading, particularly of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (which he later translated into French prose), had a deep influence on his own literary work.

His exile forced Chateaubriand to examine the causes of the French Revolution, which had cost the lives of many of his family and friends; these reflections inspired his first work, ''Essai sur les Révolutions'' (1797). An attempt in 18th-century style to explain the French Revolution, it predated his subsequent, romantic style of writing and was largely ignored. A major turning point in Chateaubriand's life was his conversion back to the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith of his childhood around 1798.

=== Consulate and Empire ===
Chateaubriand took advantage of the amnesty issued to ''émigrés'' to return to France in May 1800 (under the [[French Consulate]]); Chateaubriand edited the ''[[Mercure de France]]''. In 1802, he won fame with ''[[The Genius of Christianity|Génie du christianisme]]'' ("The Genius of Christianity"), an [[apologetics|apology]] for the Catholic Christian faith which contributed to the post-revolutionary religious revival in France. It also won him the favour of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who was eager to win over the Catholic Church at the time.  

James McMillan argues that a Europe-wide Catholic Revival emerged from the change in intellectual climate from intellectually oriented classicism to emotionally based [[romanticism]].  He concludes that Chateaubriand’s book:
:did more than any other single work to restore the credibility and prestige of Christianity in intellectual circles and launched a fashionable rediscovery of the Middle Ages and their Christian civilisation. The revival was by no means confined to an intellectual elite, however, but was evident in the real, if uneven, rechristianisation of the French countryside.&lt;ref&gt; James McMillan,  "Catholic Christianity in France from the Restoration to the separation of church and state, 1815-1905." in Sheridan Gilley and Brian Stanley, eds., ''The Cambridge history of Christianity'' (2014) 8: 217-232&lt;/ref&gt;

Appointed secretary of the legation to the [[Holy See]] by Napoleon, he accompanied [[Joseph Fesch|Cardinal Fesch]] to Rome. But the two men soon quarrelled and Chateaubriand was nominated as minister to [[Valais]] (in Switzerland). He resigned his post in disgust after Napoleon ordered the execution in 1804 of Louis XVI's cousin, [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé, duc d'Enghien]]. Chateaubriand was, after his resignation, completely dependent on his literary efforts. However, and quite unexpectedly, he received a large sum of money from the Russian Tsarina [[Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden)|Elizabeth Alexeievna]]. She had seen him as a defender of Christianity and thus worthy of her royal support.

Chateaubriand used his new-found wealth in 1806 to visit [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Egypt, [[Tunisia]] and Spain. The notes he made on his travels later formed part of a prose epic, ''Les Martyrs'', set during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Persecution of Christians|persecution of early Christianity]]. His notes also furnished a running account of the trip itself, published in 1811 as the ''Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem'' (''Itinerary from Paris to [[Jerusalem]]''). The Spanish stage of the journey inspired a third novella, ''Les aventures du dernier Abencérage'' (''The Adventures of the Last [[Abencerrages|Abencerrage]]''), which appeared in 1826.

On his return to France, he published a severe criticism of Napoleon, comparing him to [[Nero]] and predicting the emergence of a new [[Tacitean studies|Tacitus]]. Napoleon famously threatened to have Chateaubriand sabered on the steps of the Tulieries Palace for it, but settled for merely banishing him from the city. Chateaubriand retired to a modest estate he called ''La Vallée aux Loups'' ("''Wolf Valley''"), in [[Châtenay-Malabry]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of central Paris. Here he finished ''Les Martyrs'', which appeared in 1809, and began the first drafts of his memoirs. He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1811, but, given his plan to infuse his acceptance speech with criticism of the Revolution, he could not occupy his seat until after the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. His literary friends during this period included [[Germaine de Staël|Madame de Staël]], [[Joseph Joubert]] and [[Pierre-Simon Ballanche]].

=== Under the Restoration ===
{{further|Bourbon Restoration}}
He became a major figure in politics as well as literature.  At first he was a strong Royalist in the period up to 1824. His liberal phase lasted from 1824 to 1830. After that he was much less active.
After the fall of Napoleon, Chateaubriand rallied to the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]. On 30 March 1814, he wrote a pamphlet against Napoleon, titled ''De Buonaparte et des Bourbons'', of which thousands of copies were published. He then followed [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] into exile to [[Ghent]] during the [[Hundred Days]] (March–July 1815), and was nominated ambassador to Sweden.

After Napoleon's final defeat, Chateaubriand became [[Peerage of France|peer of France]] and [[state minister]] (1815). In December 1815 he voted for [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]]'s execution. However, his criticism of [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII]] in ''[[La Monarchie selon la Charte]]'', after the ''[[Chambre introuvable]]'' was dissolved, got him disgraced. He lost his function of state minister, and joined the opposition, siding with the [[Ultra-royalist]] group supporting the future [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], and becoming one of the main writers of its mouthpiece, ''[[Le Conservateur]]''.

Chateaubriand sided again with the Court after the murder of the [[Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry|Duc de Berry]] (1820), writing for the occasion the ''Mémoires sur la vie et la mort du duc''. He then served as ambassador to [[Prussia]] (1821) and the United Kingdom (1822), and even rose to the office of [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] (28 December 1822 – 4 August 1824). A [[plenipotentiary]] to the [[Congress of Verona]] (1822), he decided in favor of the [[Quintuple Alliance]]'s [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|intervention in Spain]] during the ''[[Trienio Liberal]]'', despite opposition from the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Although the move was considered a success, Chateaubriand was soon relieved of his office by Prime Minister [[Jean-Baptiste Guillaume Joseph, comte de Villèle|Jean-Baptiste de Villèle]], the leader of the ultra-royalist group, on 5 June 1824.

Consequently, he moved towards the liberal opposition, both as a Peer and as a contributor to ''[[Journal des Débats]]'' (his articles there gave the signal of the paper's similar switch, which, however, was more moderate than ''[[Le National (newspaper)|Le National]]'', directed by [[Adolphe Thiers]] and [[Armand Carrel]]). Opposing Villèle, he became highly popular as a defender of [[Freedom of the press|press freedom]] and the [[Greek War of Independence|cause of Greek independence]]. After Villèle's downfall, Charles X appointed him ambassador to the Holy See in 1828, but he resigned upon the accession of the [[Jules, Prince de Polignac|Prince de Polignac]] as premier (November 1829).

In 1830, he donated a monument to the French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]] in the church of "San Lorenzo in Lucina" in Rome.

=== July Monarchy ===
{{further|July Monarchy}}
[[Image:House of Chateaubriand 120 rue du Bac.jpg|thumb|upright|His last home, 120 [[rue du Bac]], where Chateaubriand had an apartment on the ground floor]]

In 1830, after the [[July Revolution]], his refusal to swear allegiance to the new [[House of Orléans]] king [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] put an end to his political career. He withdrew from political life to write his ''[[Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe]]'' ("Memoirs from Beyond the Grave"), published posthumously in two volumes in 1849–1850. It reflects his growing pessimism regarding the future. Although his contemporaries celebrated the present and future as an extension of the past, Chateaubriand and the new Romanticists abandoned this nostalgic outlook. Instead he foresaw chaos, discontinuity, and disaster. His diaries and letters often focused on the upheavals he could see every day--abuses of power, excesses of daily life, and disasters yet to come. His melancholy tone suggested astonishment, surrender, betrayal, and bitterness.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fritzsche, "Chateaubriand's Ruins: Loss and Memory after the French Revolution." ''History and Memory'' 10.2 (1998): 102-117. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25681029 online] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fritzsche, "Specters of history: On nostalgia, exile, and modernity." ''American Historical Review'' 106.5 (2001): 1587-1618.&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Études historiques'' was an introduction to a projected ''History of France''. He became a harsh critic of the "bourgeois king" and the [[July Monarchy]], and his planned volume on the arrest of the [[Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchess de Berry|duchesse de Berry]] caused him to be unsuccessfully prosecuted.

Chateaubriand, along with other Catholic traditionalists such as [[Pierre-Simon Ballanche|Ballanche]] or, on the other side of the political divide, the socialist and republican [[Pierre Leroux]], was one of the few of his time who attempted to conciliate the three terms of [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|''Liberté'', ''égalité'' and ''fraternité'']], going beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists as to what interpretation to give the seemingly contradictory terms.&lt;ref name=Ozouf/&gt; Chateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his ''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe'':

{{bquote|Far from being at its term, the religion of the Liberator is now only just entering its third phase, the political period, liberty, equality, fraternity.&lt;ref name=Ozouf&gt;[[Mona Ozouf]], "Liberté, égalité, fraternité", in ''Lieux de Mémoire'' (dir. [[Pierre Nora]]), tome III, Quarto Gallimard, 1997, pp.4353–4389 {{fr icon}} (abridged translation, ''Realms of Memory'', Columbia University Press, 1996–1998 {{en icon}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French: "''Loin d'être à son terme, la religion du Libérateur entre à peine dans sa troisième période, la période politique, liberté, égalité, fraternité.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his final years, he lived as a recluse in an apartment at 120 [[rue du Bac]], Paris, leaving his house only to pay visits to [[Jeanne Françoise Julie Adélaïde Récamier|Juliette Récamier]] in [[Abbaye-aux-Bois]]. His final work, ''Vie de Rancé'', was written at the suggestion of his confessor and published in 1844. It is a biography of [[Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Rancé]], a worldly seventeenth-century French aristocrat who withdrew from society to become the founder of the [[Trappist]] order of monks. The parallels with Chateaubriand's own life are striking. Chateaubriand died in Paris during the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolution of 1848]] and was buried, as he had requested, on the tidal island [[Grand Bé]] near [[Saint-Malo]], accessible only when the tide is out.

== Influence ==
His descriptions of Nature and his analysis of emotion made him the model for a generation of Romantic writers, not only in France but also abroad. For example, [[Lord Byron]] was deeply impressed by ''[[René (novella)|René]]''. The young [[Victor Hugo]] scribbled in a notebook, "To be Chateaubriand or nothing." Even his enemies found it hard to avoid his influence. [[Stendhal]], who despised him for political reasons, made use of his psychological analyses in his own book, ''De l'amour''.

Chateaubriand was the first to define the ''vague des passions'' ("intimations of passion") that later became a commonplace of Romanticism: "One inhabits, with a full heart, an empty world" (''Génie du Christianisme''). His political thought and actions seem to offer numerous contradictions: he wanted to be the friend both of legitimist royalty and of republicans, alternately defending whichever of the two seemed more in danger: "I am a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]ist out of honour, a monarchist out of reason, and a republican out of taste and temperament". He was the first of a series of French men of letters ([[Alphonse de Lamartine|Lamartine]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[André Malraux]], [[Paul Claudel]]) who tried to mix political and literary careers.

"We are convinced that the great writers have told their own story in their works", wrote Chateaubriand in ''[[The Genius of Christianity|Génie du christianisme]]''. "One only truly describes one's own heart by attributing it to another, and the greater part of genius is composed of memories". This is certainly true of Chateaubriand himself. All his works have strong autobiographical elements, overt or disguised.

[[George Brandes]], in 1901, compared the works of Chateaubriand to those of Rousseau and others:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The year 1800 was the first to produce a book bearing the imprint of the new era, a work small in size, but great in significance and mighty in the impression it made. ''Atala'' took the French public by storm in a way which no book had done since the days of ''Paul and Virginia''. It was a romance of the plains and mysterious forests of North America, with a strong, strange aroma of the untilled soil from which it sprang; it glowed with rich foreign colouring, and with the fiercer glow of consuming passion.&lt;ref&gt;George Brandes, ''Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature'', '''1''':''The Emigrant Literature'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/47675/47675-h/47675-h.htm#I p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chateaubriand was a food enthusiast; [[Chateaubriand steak]] is most likely to have been named after him.&lt;ref&gt;see the [[Chateaubriand steak]] article for discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and memberships==
Chateaubriand was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistc American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;
A French school in Rome (Italy) is named after him.

Lloyd was born in [[London]] where he spent the first two months of his life,{{cn|date=November 2014}} and raised in London and Wales. His father, a Welsh physician, specialised in [[tuberculosis]].  After a nomadic early education in six different schools, he obtained a scholarship to [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], where, despite an indifferent academic culture, he excelled in mathematics, and learned Italian from [[Wilfrid Noyce]]. The curriculum was biased to classics, which he was advised, misleadingly in his later view, to pursue. On obtaining another scholarship to [[King's College, Cambridge]] he came under the influence of the [[pre-Socratics]] specialist [[John Raven]]. He spent a year in [[Athens]] (1954–1955) where, apart from learning [[modern Greek]], he also mastered the [[bouzouki]].

== Career ==
A keen interest in [[anthropology]] informed his reading of ancient Greek philosophy, and his doctoral studies, conducted under the supervision of [[Geoffrey Kirk]], focused on patterns of [[wiktionary:polarity|polarity]] and [[analogy]] in Greek thought, a thesis which, revised, was eventually published in 1966. 

He was called up for [[National Service]] in 1958. On 14 March 1959, following training, he was [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[British Army]]'s [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]]. He was given the [[service number]] 460084.&lt;ref name="LG 19 May 1959"&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=41713 |date=19 May 1959 |page=3318 |supp=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was posted to [[Cyprus]] after the [[EOKA]] insurgency. 

On his return to Cambridge in 1960, a chance conversation with [[Edmund Leach]] stimulated him to read deeply in the emerging approach of [[structural anthropology]] being formulated by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. In 1965, thanks to the support of [[Moses Finley]], he was appointed to an assistant lectureship. A recurring element of his approach was the consideration of how political discourse influenced the forms of scientific discourse and demonstration in Ancient Greece.

After a visit to lecture in China in 1987, Lloyd turned to the study of [[Classical Chinese]]. This has added a broad comparative scope to his more recent work, which, following in the wake of [[Joseph Needham]]'s pioneering studies, analyses how the different political cultures of ancient China and Greece influenced the different forms of scientific discourse in those cultures.

In 1989 he was appointed [[List of Masters of Darwin College, Cambridge|Master]] of [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]], where he remains as an Honorary Fellow. Presently he spends a part of each year in his other home in Spain,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} where much of his writing is now done.

==Honours==
Lloyd was elected a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] in 1983 and awarded its [[Kenyon Medal]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenyon Medal 2007 |url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/about/medals/Kenyon_Medal_2007.cfm |website=Prizes and medals |publisher=British Academy |accessdate=13 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614223140/http://www.britac.ac.uk/about/medals/Kenyon_Medal_2007.cfm |archivedate=14 June 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He received the [[George Sarton Medal]] of the [[History of Science Society]] in 1987. He was elected to Honorary Foreign Membership of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1995, to the International Academy for the History of Science in 1997, the year in which he was knighted for 'services to the history of thought'. In 2013 he received the [[Dan David Prize]] on the modern legacy of the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Dan David Prize • Laureates 2013 • Sir Geoffrey Lloyd | publisher = | date = | year = | url = http://www.dandavidprize.org/laureates/2013/157-past-classics,-the-modern-legacy-of-the-ancient-world/486-prof-sir-geoffrey-lloyd | accessdate = 30 Aug 2014
 | quote = Sir Geoffrey Lloyd is the greatest living scholar of the history of ancient science, who has completely transformed the field over the last four decades. He has brought together insights from anthropology, sociology and general history to bear upon the history of ideas, and initiated the research program of comparative studies of Greek and Chinese science. He showed how Greek science is a product of Greek society, and he crucially uncovered the great diversity of Greek scientific practices.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the Advisory Board of [[The International Academic Forum]]. In 2014 he received the [[International Prize (Fyssen Foundation)|International Fyssen Prize]] for work in Cross-Cultural Cognition. In 2015, he was elected a [[Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales]] (FLSW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fellows Elected 2015|url=http://learnedsocietywales.ac.uk/sites/default/files/NEW%20FELLOWS%20LIST%202015.pdf|publisher=Learned Society of Wales|accessdate=2 May 2015|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Geistesgeschichte''''' (from German ''[[Geist]]'', "spirit" [here connoting the [[metaphysical]] realm, in contradistinction to the material], and ''Geschichte'', "history", "science") is a concept in the [[history of ideas]] denoting the branch of study concerned with the ''undercurrents'' of cultural manifestations, within the history of a people, that are peculiar to a specific timeframe.

The term is a largely untranslatable term, sometimes translated as "intellectual history"&lt;ref&gt;Fugmann, Nicole. 1997. "Contemporary Editorial Theory and the Transvaluation of Postmodern Critique." ''Text'' 10: 15–30, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bontempelli, Pier Carlo. 2004. ''Knowledge, Power, and Discipline: German Studies and National Identity.'' Transl. Gabriele Poole. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; or "history of ideas",&lt;ref&gt;Crossley, Paul. 1997. "Introduction." Peter Draper (ed.), ''Reassessing Nikolaus Pevsner'', (pp. 1–28). Aldershot, UK: Ashgate, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strelka, Joseph. "On German ''Geistesgeschichte'' and Its Impact on Comparative Literature." François Jost (ed.), ''Aesthetics and the Literature of Ideas'', (pp. 44–52) . Cranbury, NJ: Associated University Presses, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes used synonymously with ''Problemgeschichte''.  The branch of study it denotes is often seen as having been inspired by the type of work done by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and his followers.

The '''Jacobite risings''', also known as the '''Jacobite rebellions''' or the '''War of the British Succession''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Black |first=Jeremy |date=2015 |title=A Short History of Britain |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OuIyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 |location=London |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |page=49–50 |isbn=9781472586681 |accessdate=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were a series of uprisings, rebellions, and wars in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] occurring between 1688 and 1746. The uprisings had the aim of returning [[James II of England|James II of England and VII of Scotland]], the last [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] British monarch, and later his descendants of the [[House of Stuart]], to the throne of Great Britain after they had been deposed by Parliament during the [[Glorious Revolution]]. The series of conflicts takes its name [[Jacobitism]], from {{lang|la|Jacobus}}, the [[Latin]] form of James.

'''Jacobite rising''' may refer to any of the following:

* [[Jacobite rising of 1689]]
* [[Williamite War in Ireland]], James's attempts to regain the throne in Ireland 
* [[Jacobite assassination plot 1696]]
* [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1708)]], included Jacobite support.
* [[Jacobite rising of 1715]]
* [[Jacobite rising of 1719]]

'''Jonathan Locke Hart''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[poet]], [[literary]] [[scholar]] and [[historian]].

Hart trained at the [[University of Toronto]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has held visiting appointments at [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], Toronto, Cambridge and elsewhere and has given readings and lectures in many countries. He is currently employed by [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]].

Hart's poetry has appeared in ''[[Harvard Review]]'', ''Grain'', ''Mattoid'', and he has published books of poetry, such as ''Breath and Dust'', ''Dream China'' and ''Dream Salvage''. He has written extensively on [[Shakespeare]] (for instance, ''Theater and World''), on [[literary theory]] (''Northrop Frye''), and on history, especially on empire and on the expansion of [[Europe]] (for example, ''Representing the New World'', and ''Empires and Colonies'').  His poetry often explores the [[psychology]] of landscape and a sense of loss and exile. A central concern of his creative work  and non-fiction is the relation between history and fictions (literary and legal).

''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' revealed that since September 2011, Hart had simultaneously held two full-time academic positions until some time prior to 2013, one at the [[University of Alberta]] in Canada and another at [[Durham University]] in England. The University of Alberta only became aware of the situation in late 2012, and Hart is no longer employed by Durham.&lt;ref&gt;Jump, Paul.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3979">'''Joshua the [[Stylite]]''' (also spelled '''Yeshu Stylite'''&lt;ref&gt;Witold Witakowski ''Chronicle: known also as the Chronicle of Zuqnin'', Liverpool University Press, 1996, p. xxi&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Ieshu Stylite''') is the attributed author of a [[chronicle]] which narrates the history of the [[Roman%E2%80%93Persian Wars#Anastasian War|war]] between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanian Empire|Persians]] between 502 and 506, and which is one of the earliest and best historical documents preserved in [[Syriac language|Syriac]].

The work owes its preservation to having been incorporated in the third part of the ''[[Zuqnin Chronicle|Chronicle of Zuqnin]]'', and may probably have had a place in the second part of the ''Ecclesiastical History'' of [[John of Ephesus]], from whom (as [[François Nau]] has shown) Pseudo-Dionysius copied all or most of the matter contained in his third part. The chronicle in question is anonymous, and Nau has shown that the note of a [[copyist]], which was thought to assign it to the monk Joshua of Zuqnin near Amida ([[Diyarbakir]]), more probably refers to the compiler of the whole work in which it was incorporated. In any case, the author was an eyewitness of many of the events which he describes, and must have been living at [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] during the years when it suffered so severely during the [[Roman–Persian Wars]]. His view of events is everywhere characterized by his belief in overruling Providence; and as he eulogizes [[Flavian II of Antioch|Flavian II]], the [[Chalcedon]]ian [[patriarch of Antioch]], in warmer terms than those in which he praises his great Monophysite contemporaries, [[Jacob of Serugh]] and [[Philoxenus of Mabbog]], he was probably an orthodox [[Catholic]].

The chronicle was first made known in [[Joseph Simon Assemani|Assemani]]'s abridged Latin version (B O i. 260–83) and was edited in 1876 by [[Paulin Martin]] and (with an English translation) by [[William Wright (Orientalist)|William Wright]] in 1882. After an elaborate dedication to a friend the priest and abbot Sergius, a brief recapitulation of events from the death of [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in 363 and a fuller account of the reigns of the Persian kings [[Peroz I of Persia|Peroz I]] (457-484) and [[Balash of Persia|Balash]] (484-488), the writer enters upon his main theme: the history of the disturbed relations between the Persian and Roman Empires from the beginning of the reign of [[Kavadh I of Persia|Kavadh I]] (489–531), which culminated in the great war of 502–6.

From October 494 to the conclusion of peace near the end of 506, the author gives an annalistic account, with careful specification of dates, of the main events in [[Mesopotamia]], the theatre of conflict such as the siege and capture of Amid by the Persians (502–3), their unsuccessful siege of Edessa (503), and the abortive attempt of the Romans to recover Amida (504–5). The work was probably written a few years after the conclusion of the war. The style is graphic and straightforward, and the author was evidently a man of good education and of a simple, honest mind.

A modern German translation with a good historical commentary was published 1997.

{{Nihongo|'''''Kabukibu!'''''|カブキブ!}} is a light novel series written by Yūri Eda, with illustrations by Ishinoya. The series began on August 24, 2013 and has since collected five volumes, published by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] as of December 2016. The series is about Kurogo Kurusu, a boy who is obsessed with [[kabuki]] and decides to form a kabuki club at his high school. A manga adaptation by Chizu Kamiko is being serialized on Kadokawa Shoten's ''[[Young Ace]]'' since March 2017. A 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Studio Deen]], (with original character designs by [[CLAMP]]) aired between April 6, 2017 and June 22, 2017.

==Plot==
Kurogo Kurusu, a high school boy who loves the art of [[kabuki]], so much that it is annoying. He yearns to perform kabuki for a club, but his school doesn't have one. Kurogo decides to create his own and sets out to gather members.

==Characters==
;{{nihongo|Kurogo Kurusu|来栖黒悟}}
:{{anime voices|Taichi Ichikawa}}&lt;ref name="cast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/kabukibu/staffcast/|title=カブクブ！スタッフ キャスト|publisher=TBS|language=Japanese|accessdate=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The main protagonist of the series, Kurusu is an upbeat high school boy with passion for kabuki. He is simple-minded and straightforward. It is unknown what happened to his parents, since he lives with his aunt Saiko, a manga artist who is often rushing to meet deadlines, leaving Kurusu to take care of himself. He's noted to be short of height and having a baby-face. However, his love for Kabuki is unparalleled. He is the president and director of the club.
;{{nihongo|Tonbo Murase|村瀬とんぼ}}
:{{anime voices|[[Yūichiro Umehara]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:Kurusu's neighbour and best friend, who aids him in creating his kabuki club. He's good with information and can easily find potential candidates for the club or other references for whatever Kurusu needs. He's more serious than Kurusu, but fully supports him. During his early childhood he earned many awards, which in turn generated the ire and envy of his peers, causing them to bully him relentlessly until he passed out in his home from the fear. As a result he moved next to Kurusu with the two becoming close. He acts as the sound and light director of the club.
;{{nihongo|Shin Akutsu|阿久津新}}
:{{anime voices|[[Ryōta Ōsaka]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:A descendant from a family of Kabuki performers. He's aware of kabuki and knows many of its customs but resents it for unknown reasons. He attempts instead to form a Rock Band, but he is tone-deaf and doesn't get along with his fellow members. Akutsu is noted to be fairly talented at Kabuki, however his deeply narcissistic personality along his recurrent need to be the center of attention are his major setbacks. He had his hair dyed red and blond until he cut it down, now having a much shorter brown-coloured hair. He has a complicated relationship with his family; his mother was the one who taught him Kabuki when he was younger, but lied about his father being a famous kabuki actor. Then in middle school, Shin heard the truth from his grandmother and his mother moved away to America, marrying another man. This incident is where Shin's hate for Kabuki stems from.
;{{nihongo|Jin Ebihara|蛯原仁}}
:{{anime voices|[[Kengo Kawanishi]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:A descendant from a family of Kabuki performers. He has been practicing kabuki since he was four years old, but he still feels his performance is lacking. He greatly admires his grandfather who is a famous performer, a Living National Treasure, and aspires to be with him despite the fact his grandfather wants Jin to develop his own sense and broaden his horizons. He takes kabuki very seriously, rejecting Kurusu's proposal to join his club. He considers Kurusu's Kabuki club to be a 'joke'.
;{{nihongo|Hanamichi Niwa|丹羽花満}}
:{{anime voices|[[Nobunaga Shimazaki]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:A tall and intimidating upperclassman from Kurusu's school. He is silent and usually covered in bruises causing many to believe he's a delinquent. He practiced dance for a long time and had a promising future but decided to quit it, in favour of more aggressive hobbies like bodybuilding and martial arts. It turns out however that Niwa is a rather effeminate individual with a liking towards feminine things (such as female dancing or even cooking), but his continuous growth and masculine traits made it exceedingly awkward to do so. Furthermore he went out with a friend he was interested on, who unfortunately had a boyfriend of her own and mostly saw Niwa as more of a female friend than a love interest, which caused him to force himself into a more masculine persona. However he's able to accept himself through Kurusu's encouragement. He is one of the performers in the club and also helps teach the other members dance.
;{{nihongo|Kaoru Asagi|浅葱芳}}
:{{anime voices|[[Yuko Kaida]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:An upperclassman from Kurusu's school and a member of the Drama Club. Although confused by many to be male, Kaoru is in fact a girl. Her androgynous appearance and courteous behaviour make her popular amongst other girls, even those from other schools. Kurusu tries to recruit her, much to her surprise as kabuki is usually performed by men. She eventually joins the Kabuki Club, performing there and in the Drama Club.
;{{nihongo|Maruko Janome|蛇ノ目丸子}}
:{{anime voices|[[Yumi Uchiyama]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:A student from Kurusu's school, she is Akutsu's neighbour and childhood friend. A passionate otaku, she's well renowned in the internet due to her talent in creating costumes of varying designs. She is blunt, speaks fast and is well aware of her chubby face, believing herself to be unattractive and thus "beats people" in saying it first. She's eventually recruited into the Kabuki Club as the costume designer.
;{{nihongo|Riri Miwayama|三輪山梨里}}
:{{anime voices|[[Ayaka Asai]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:Niwa's childhood friend and current classmate. She spent a year in Canada so she was unaware of the reasons that changed Niwa's personality. She joins the Kabuki Club as a helper upon Niwa's request.
;{{nihongo|Kazuma Katsumi|数馬克己}}
:{{anime voices|[[Kazutomi Yamamoto]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:A member of the Drama Club. He assists the Kabuki Club upon Kaoru's request. Although he likes drama, he feels increasingly frustrated by the Drama Club's president feminist's management, putting males in charge of lesser tasks. Becoming motivated by Kurusu's ideas he quits the Drama Club and becomes a full member of the Kabuki Club. He is later revealed to have a girlfriend.
;{{nihongo|Tsurani Toomi|遠見連}}
:{{anime voices|[[Tomoaki Maeno]]}}&lt;ref name="cast" /&gt;
:A teacher in Kurusu's school. He serves as the "advisor" of the Kabuki Club, however he knows very little about Kabuki and mostly serves to fill in a position to allow the club's existence.

==Reception==
[[Anime News Network]] had four editors review the first episode of the anime:&lt;ref name="Kabuki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2017/spring/kabukibu/.114515|title=''Kabukibu!'' - The Spring 2017 Anime Preview Guide|website=Anime News Network|date=April 7, 2017|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite seeing it as a typical high school club premise, Lynzee Loveridge was optimistic about learning the art of kabuki as the show progresses from its debut episode based on the studio producing it; Jacob Chapman said that the show's "refreshing sincerity and quirky flavor" of slice-of-life could bring in viewers intrigued by the notion of knowing more about its subject matter but may have to get through subpar animation and a lack of personality to get there; Paul Jensen was enthralled by the protagonist Kurogo's passion to learn more about kabuki performances and the shift in art style when viewing them but questioned whether the show can keep that pace with further episodes. The fourth reviewer, Rebecca Silverman, felt that the slice-of-life structure the introductory episode takes could hold back the potential it has with its premise, saying that it "doesn't feel like a great representation of what the show could become, even more so than other series."&lt;ref name="Kabuki"/&gt;

The '''''Lexikon des Mittelalters''''' ("Lexicon of the Middle Ages", LMA, LexMA) is a [[German language|German]] [[encyclopedia]] on the history and culture of the [[Middle Ages]]. Written by authors from all over the world, it comprises more than 36,000 articles in 9 volumes. Historically the works range from the [[Late Antiquity]] to about 1500, covering the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Arab world]] .

The first six volumes were published by [[Artemis]] (later Artemis &amp; Winkler), [[Munich]] and [[Zürich]]; volumes seven through nine by [[LexMA]], Munich. In 2000, an electronic (standalone) edition of the ''Lexikon'' was published on [[CD-ROM]] by [[Brepols]].

==Praise and criticism==
The first volume was widely praised upon publication; G.A. Holmes, in ''[[The English Historical Review]]'', foresaw that the entire encyclopedia would be "a valuable reference work of a kind which medievalists hitherto lacked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Maithil Karna Kayasthak Panjik Sarvekshan''''' (''A Survey of the Panji of the Karan Kayasthas of Mithila'') is a book written by [[Binod Bihari Verma]] in [[Maithili language|Maithili]]. It is a research study on the available ancient manuscripts in the [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]] region, called as [[Panjis]], which are genealogical charts of [[Maithil Brahmin]] and [[Kayastha]]s castes. This study deals with the manuscripts available in respect of [[Karna Kayastha]]s.

==Overview==
The work is based on several manuscripts of [[Panjis]] obtained from various panjikars of [[Darbhanga]], [[Bihar]]. The [[Panjis]] concerned deals with the [[genealogy]] of the [[Karna Kayasthas]]. The manuscript is written in [[Tirhuta]] script ([[Maithili script]]) on palm leaves and old paper called as '[[Basaha]]' made out of indigenous material. The work deals with ''Mulgrams'' (original village homes) and the transmigration of the Karna Kayasthas to subsequent places of living. The book is important for the geographical and social study of North [[Bihar]] of the concerned period. The work also deals with personalities of eminence among the Karna Kayasthas since 12th century. Dr (Prof) Surendra Lal Das  along with Panjikars and other eminent Karna kayastha members  formed "Akhil Bhartiya Karn kayastha Mahasabha" to protect the original and traditional values of Panji .

The '''Mark-Twain-Straße''' is a street in the [[Munich]] district [[Pasing-Obermenzing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.neue-strassen.de/bayern/munchen/mark-twain-strasse | title=Mark-Twain-Straße in München | author= | date= | website=neue-strassen.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was built around 1900. It was named in 1947 after the American writer [[Mark Twain]] (1835-1910).

== History ==
Originally called Kirchenstraße, the street connects [[Alte Allee (Munich)|Alte Allee]] with [[Barystraße]]. It belonged to the extension planning of the [[Villenkolonie Pasing II]] between Alter Allee and [[Pippinger Straße]], which to this day was not carried out. Between Barystraße 10 and 12 there is an undeveloped property owned by the city of Munich, so that the Mark-Twain-Straße can be extended at any time in the direction of Pippinger Straße.

Until the [[World War I|First World War]], only two [[villa]]s were built on Mark-Twain- Straße, No. 2 and 4. The complete development of the [[Avenue (landscape)|alley]] laid out street happened in recent decades. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Weski | first=Timm | date=2004 | title=Denkmäler in Bayern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42327">[[File:Woman in a red miniskirt and green cardigan crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman wearing a red miniskirt]] 
A '''miniskirt''' (sometimes hyphenated as '''mini-skirt''' or separated as '''mini skirt''') is a [[skirt]] with a [[hemline]] well above the knees, generally at mid-thigh level, normally no longer than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} below the buttocks;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} Sophie George, ''Le Vêtement de A à Z'', {{ISBN|978-2-9530240-1-2}}, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[dress]] with such a hemline is called a '''minidress''' or a '''miniskirt dress'''. A ''micro-miniskirt'' or '''microskirt''' is a miniskirt with its hemline at the upper thigh.

Short skirts have existed for a long time, though they were generally not called "mini" or became a fashion trend until the 1960s. Instances of clothing resembling miniskirts have been identified by archaeologists and historians as far back as c. 1390–1370 BCE. In the early 20th century, the dancer [[Josephine Baker]]'s banana skirt that she wore for her mid-1920s performances in the [[Folies Bergère]] was subsequently likened to a miniskirt. Extremely short skirts became a staple of 20th-century [[science fiction]], particularly in 1940s pulp artwork such as that by [[Earle K. Bergey]] who depicted futuristic women in a "stereotyped combination" of metallic miniskirt, bra and boots.

Hemlines were just above the knee in 1961, and gradually climbed upward over the next few years. By 1966, some designs had the hem at the upper thigh. Stockings with suspenders were not considered practical with miniskirts and were replaced with coloured tights. The popular acceptance of miniskirts peaked in the "[[Swinging London]]" of the 1960s, and has continued to be commonplace, particularly among younger women and teenage girls. Before that time, short skirts were only seen in sport and dance clothing, such as skirts worn by female tennis players, figure skaters, cheerleaders, and dancers.

Several designers have been credited with the invention of the 1960s miniskirt, most significantly the London-based designer [[Mary Quant]] and the Parisian [[André Courrèges]].

==Pre-1960==

While very short skirts have existed for a long time, they were generally not called "mini" until the 1960s. Figurines produced by the [[Vinča culture]] (c. 5700–4500 BCE) have been interpreted by archaeologists as representing women in miniskirt-like garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cvekic |first1=Ljilja |title=Prehistoric women had passion for fashion |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-archaeology-balkans-idUSL0782181520071112 |accessdate=19 September 2016 |work=Reuters |date=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oldest surviving garments resembling a miniskirt is the short woollen skirt with bronze ornaments worn by the [[Egtved Girl]] for her burial in the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (c. 1390–1370 BCE).&lt;ref name="Harding2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.

One of the earliest known cultures where women regularly wore clothing resembling miniskirts was a subgroup of the [[Miao people]] of China, the Duan Qun Miao ({{zh|c=短裙苗|p= duǎn qún miáo}}, literally "short skirt Miao").&lt;ref name=norma&gt;{{cite book |last1=Diamond |first1=Norma |editor1-last=Harrell |editor1-first=Stevan |title=Cultural encounters on China's ethnic frontiers|date=1997|publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97528-8 |pages=98–103|edition=2nd pr. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WChrSv86uIsC&amp;pg=PA98 |chapter=Defining the Miao}}&lt;/ref&gt; In albums produced during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912) from the early eighteenth century onwards to illustrate the various types of Miao, the Duan Qun Miao women were depicted wearing "mini skirts that barely cover the buttocks."&lt;ref name=norma/&gt; At least one of the "One Hundred Miao Pictures" albums contains a poem that specifically describes how the women's short skirts and navel-baring styles were an identifier for this particular group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steele|first1=Apollonia|title=Chinese Language Book|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/lib-old/SpecColl/Chinese/index.html|publisher=University of Calgary library|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unknown (pre-1911)|last2=Zhang|first2=Jane (translator)|title=Duan Qun Miao (Mini-Skirt Miao)|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/lib-old/SpecColl/Chinese/page32.html|publisher=University of Calgary Library|accessdate=21 October 2015|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extremely short skirts became a staple of 20th-century science fiction, particularly in 1940s pulp artwork such as that by [[Earle K. Bergey]] who depicted futuristic women in a "stereotyped combination" of metallic miniskirt, bra and boots.&lt;ref name=bass99&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassior |first1=Jean-Noel |title=Space patrol : missions of daring in the name of early television |date=2005 |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C.

==1960s==

The manager of an unnamed shop in London's Oxford Street began experimenting in 1960 with skirt hemlines an inch above the knees of window mannequins, and noted how positively his customers responded.&lt;ref&gt;Montreal Gazette, May 28, 1960, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Hemlines were just above the knee in 1961, and gradually climbed upward over the next few years. By 1966, some designs had the hem at the upper thigh. Stockings with suspenders (American English: "[[wikt:garter|garters]]") were not considered practical with miniskirts and were replaced with coloured tights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laver|first=James|title=Costume and Fashion: A Concise History|year=2002|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd. |location=London |isbn=978-0-500-20348-4 |pages=261–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 1960s, an even shorter version, called the microskirt or micro-mini, emerged.&lt;ref name=cumming&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cumming |first1=Valerie |last2=Cunnington |first2=C.

Extremely short skirts, some as much as eight inches above the knee, were observed in Britain in the summer of 1962.&lt;ref name=gilmore&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gilmore|first1=Eddie|title=British Girls (Ya!

The earliest known reference to the miniskirt is in a humorous 1962 article datelined Mexico City and describing the "mini-skirt" or "Ya-Ya" as a controversial item of clothing that was the latest thing on the production line there.  The article characterized the miniskirt as stopping eight inches above the knee.  It referred to a writing by a psychiatrist, whose name it did not provide, who had argued that the miniskirt was a youthful protest of international threats to peace.  Much of the article described the reactions of men, who were said to favor the fashion on young women to whom they were unrelated, but to oppose it on their own wives and fiancés.&lt;ref&gt;John Abney, "Yahoo!  The Ya-Ya!" ''Billings Gazette'', Aug. 6, 1962, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, by shortening the skirts to less than {{convert|24|inch}} they were classed as children's garments rather than adult clothes. Children's clothing was not subject to [[purchase tax]] whereas adult clothing was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = "premierludwig" | title = Trends Of The Mid-1960s workshop | date = 19 July 2005| website = Vintage Fashion Guild | url = http://forums.vintagefashionguild.org/threads/trends-of-the-mid-1960s-workshop.10771/ | accessdate = 31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of tax meant that the price was correspondingly less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Livraghi | first = Giancarlo | title = The pitfalls of fashion | website = off-line | date = 2002 | url = http://www.gandalf.it/offline/off50-en.htm | accessdate=31 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thomas | first = Pauline | title = The 60s Mini Skirt 1960s Fashion History | website = Fashion-Era.com | date = 2014 | url = http://www.fashion-era.com/the_1960s_mini.htm | accessdate = 31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several designers have been credited with the invention of the 1960s miniskirt, most significantly the London-based designer [[Mary Quant]] and the Parisian [[André Courrèges]]. Although Quant reportedly named the skirt after her favourite make of car, the [[Mini]],&lt;ref name="katya"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman |first1=Katya |title=Short but sweet: The miniskirt |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20140523-short-but-sweet-the-miniskirt |publisher=BBC |accessdate=9 June 2016 |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miles |first1=Barry |title=The British invasion: the music, the times, the era |date=2009 |publisher=Sterling |location=New York, NY |isbn=9781402769764 |page=203|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8xbaIlrUREC&amp;pg=PA203}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no consensus as to who designed it first.

The miniskirt is one of the garments most widely associated with Mary Quant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horton |first1=Ros |last2=Simmons |first2=Sally|title=Women who changed the world : fifty inspirational women who shaped history |date=2006 |publisher=Quercus |location=London |isbn=9781847240262 |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quant herself is ambivalent about the claim that she invented the miniskirt, stating that her customers should take credit, as she herself wore very short skirts, and they requested even shorter hemlines for themselves.&lt;ref name=polanq&gt;{{cite book |last1=Polan  |first1=Brenda |last2=Tredre |first2=Roger |title=The great fashion designers |date=2009 |publisher=Berg Publishers |location=Oxford |isbn=9780857851741 |pages=103–105 |edition=English |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nevAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|chapter=Mary Quant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether or not Quant invented the miniskirt, it is widely agreed that she was one of its highest-profile champions.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kennedy |first1=Carol |title=From Dynasties to Dotcoms : The Rise, Fall and Reinvention of British Business in the Past 100 Years |date=2003 |publisher=Kogan Page Ltd |location=London |isbn=9780749441272 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XL5nk5D6woC&amp;pg=PA122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quant loved [[Mini#Mini Cooper and Cooper S: 1961–2000|Mini Cooper]] cars and named the garment after them, saying that car and skirt were both "optimistic, exuberant, young, flirty," and complemented each other.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt;

Quant had started experimenting with shorter skirts in the late 1950s, when she started making her own designs up to stock her boutique on the King's Road.&lt;ref name=polanq/&gt; Among her inspirations was the memory of seeing a young tap-dancer wearing a "tiny skirt over thick black tights," influencing her designs for young, active women who did not wish to resemble their mothers.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt;&lt;ref name=polanq/&gt; In addition to the miniskirt, Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned [[tights]] that tended to accompany the garment, although their creation is also attributed to the Spanish couturier [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] who offered [[harlequin]]-patterned tights in 1962&lt;ref name=jess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carter |first=Ernestine |title=The changing world of fashion: 1900 to the present |year=1977 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |isbn=9780297773498 |pages=213 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=PNn-T8q3GMXV0QXltIC7Bw&amp;id=AkdEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Balenciaga+stockings+patterned&amp;q=Balenciaga+harlequin#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to Bates.&lt;ref name=bates43&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lester |first1=Richard |title=John Bates : fashion designer|date=2008|publisher=ACC Editions |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |isbn=9781851495702|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a Mary Quant minidress was among the 10 British "design classics" featured on a series of [[Royal Mail]] stamps, alongside the [[Tube map]], the [[Spitfire]], and the [[red telephone box]].&lt;ref name=katya/&gt;

;André Courrèges
Courrèges explicitly claimed that he invented the mini, and accused Quant of only "commercialising" it.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; He presented short skirts measuring four inches above the knee in January 1965 for that year's Spring/Summer collection,&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt; although some sources claim that Courrèges had been designing miniskirts as early as 1961, the year he launched his couture house.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; The collection, which also included [[pantsuit|trouser suits]] and cut-out backs and midriffs, was designed for a new type of athletic, active young woman.&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt; Courrèges had presented "above-the-knee" skirts in his August 1964 haute couture presentation which was proclaimed the "best show seen so far" for that season by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Patricia|title=Courrèges Is Star of Best Show Seen So Far|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/03/courreges-is-star-of-best-show-seen-so-far.html|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=The New York Times|date=3 August 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Courrèges look, featuring a knit [[bodystocking]] with a [[gabardine]] miniskirt slung around the hips, was widely copied and plagiarised, much to the designer's chagrin, and it would be 1967 before he again held a press showing for his work.&lt;ref name=polanc/&gt; Steele has described Courrèges's work as a "brilliant couture version of youth fashion" whose sophistication far outshone Quant's work, although she champions the Quant claim.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt; Others, such as Jess Cartner-Morley of ''[[The Guardian]]'' explicitly credit him, rather than Quant, as the miniskirt's creator.&lt;ref name=jess&gt;{{cite news|last=Cartner-Morley|first=Jess|title=Chelsea girl who instigated a new era|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/02/audreygillan|accessdate=12 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that John Bates, rather than Quant or Courrèges, innovated the miniskirt had an influential champion in [[Marit Allen]], who as editor of the influential "Young Ideas" pages for UK [[Vogue (British magazine)|''Vogue'']], kept track of up-and-coming young designers.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; In 1966 she chose Bates to design her mini-length wedding outfit in white gabardine and silver [[PVC]].&lt;ref name=allen/&gt; In January 1965 Bates's "skimp dress" with its "short-short skirt" was featured in ''Vogue,'' and would later be chosen as the [[Dress of the Year]].&lt;ref name=bates45&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lester|first1=Richard|title=John Bates : fashion designer|date=2008|publisher=ACC Editions|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=9781851495702|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Breward |editor1-first=Christopher |editor2-last=Lister|editor2-first=Jenny|editor3-last=Gilbert|editor3-first=David |title=Swinging sixties : fashion in London and beyond ; 1955 – 1970|date=2006|publisher=V&amp;A Publ. |location=London |isbn=9781851774845 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dress of the Year walkthrough|url=http://www.fashionmuseum.co.uk/galleries/dress-year |website=Fashion Museum, Bath|publisher=Bath &amp; North East Somerset Council 2015|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates was also famous for having designed mini-coats and dresses and other outfits for [[Emma Peel]] (played by [[Diana Rigg]]) in the TV series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', although the manufacturers blocked his request for patterned tights to enable Emma Peel to fight in skirts if necessary.&lt;ref name=allen/&gt;&lt;ref name=bates43/&gt;

An alternative origin story for the miniskirt came from [[Barbara Hulanicki]] of the London boutique [[Biba]], who recalled that in 1966 she received a delivery of stretchy [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]] skirts that had shrunk drastically in transit. Much to her surprise, the ten-inch long garments rapidly sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|title=Barbara Hulanicki and Biba|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/biba,-barbara-hulanicki/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 [[Rudi Gernreich]] was among the first American designers to offer miniskirts, in the face of strongly worded censure and criticism from American couturiers [[James Galanos]] and [[Norman Norell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writer|title=Fashion: Up, Up &amp; Away|work=TIME |date=1 December 1967}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the miniskirt also came from the Paris couturier [[Coco Chanel]],who declared the style "disgusting" despite being herself famed for supporting shorter skirts in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=steele/&gt;

Owing to Quant's position in the heart of fashionable "[[Swinging London]]", the miniskirt was able to spread beyond a simple street fashion into a major international trend. The style came into prominence when [[Jean Shrimpton]] wore [[White shift dress of Jean Shrimpton|a short white shift dress]], made by Colin Rolfe, on 30 October 1965 at Derby Day, first day of the annual [[Melbourne Cup]] Carnival in Australia, where it caused a sensation. According to Shrimpton, who claimed that the brevity of the skirt was due mainly to Rolfe's having insufficient material, the ensuing controversy was as much as anything to do with her having dispensed with a hat and gloves, seen as essential accessories in such a conservative society.&lt;ref name="shrimpton"&gt;Shrimpton, Jean (1990).

Upper garments, such as rugby shirts, were sometimes adapted as mini-dresses. With the rise in hemlines, the wearing of tights or [[pantyhose]], in place of [[stockings]], became more common. Some European countries &lt;!---which? Must look this up---&gt; banned mini-skirts from being worn in public, claiming they were an invitation to rapists. In response, Quant retorted that there was clearly no understanding of the tights worn underneath.&lt;ref name="Adburgham"&gt;Adburgham, Alison (1967-10-10). Mary Quant. Interview with Alison Adburgham, ''The Guardian'', 10 October 1967. Retrieved from http://century.guardian.co.uk/1960-1969/Story/0,6051,106475,00.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The response to the miniskirt was particularly harsh in Africa, where many state governments saw them as an un-African garment and part of the corrupting influence of the West.&lt;ref name=ross&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ross |first1=Robert |title=Clothing: A Global History |date=2008 |publisher=Polity |isbn=9780745631868 |pages=162–163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwprGRt3XkMC&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en |chapter=Engendered Acceptance and Rejection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young city-dwelling African women who wore Western clothing such as the miniskirt were particularly at risk of attack based on their clothing, although Robert Ross notes that gender roles and politics were also a key factor.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; The urban woman earning her own living and independence was seen as a threat to masculine authority, particularly if she wore clothing seen as un-African.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; Short skirts were seen as indicating that their wearer was a prostitute, and by conflation, a witch who drained male-dominated society of its vitality and energy.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; In addition to prostitute and witch, miniskirts also became associated with secretaries, schoolgirls and undergraduates, and young women with "[[wikt:sugar daddy|sugar daddies]]" as lovers or boyfriends.&lt;ref name=ivaska&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ivaska |first1=Andrew M. |editor1-last=Allman |editor1-first=Jean |title=Fashioning Africa: Power and the Politics of Dress |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=0253111048 |pages=113–114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_K9Zvt8kkkcC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en |chapter='Anti-mini Militants Meet Modern Misses': Urban Style, Gender, and the Politics of 'National Culture' in 1960s Dar es Salaam, Tanzania}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew M. Ivaska has noted that these various tropes boiled down to a basic fear of female power, fear that a woman would use her education or sexual power to control men and/or achieve her own independence, and that the miniskirt therefore became a tangible object of these fears.&lt;ref name=ivaska/&gt;

In 1968 the Youth League of [[Tanzania]]'s ruling [[Tanganyika African National Union|TANU]] party launched Operation Vijana.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; Organised and run by young men, Vijana was a morality campaign targeting indecent clothing, which led to attacks on women with at least one stoning reportedly triggered by the victim's miniskirt.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; Gangs of youths patrolled bus stations and streets looking for women dressed "inappropriately," and dealing out physical attacks and beatings.&lt;ref name=ivaska/&gt; In [[Ethiopia]], an attack on women wearing miniskirts triggered a riot in which a hundred cars were set on fire and fifty people injured.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt;

[[Kamuzu Banda]], president of [[Malawi]], described miniskirts as a "diabolic fashion which must disappear from the country once and for all."&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; It is also reported that [[Kenneth Kaunda]], president of [[Zambia]], cited [[apartheid]] and the miniskirt as his two primary hates.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; By the mid-1970s the [[Zanzibar]] revolutionary party had forbidden both women and men from wearing a long list of garments, hairstyles and cosmetics, including miniskirts.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt;

==Post-1960s==

===1970s===

From 1969 onwards, the fashion industry largely returned to longer skirts such as the ''midi'' and the ''maxi''. Journalist [[Christopher Booker]] gave two reasons for this reaction: firstly, that "there was almost nowhere else to go ... the mini-skirts could go no higher"; and secondly, in his view, "dressed up in mini-skirts and shiny [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] [[Mackintosh|macs]], given such impersonal names as 'dolly birds', girls had been transformed into throwaway plastic objects".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Booker (1980) ''The Seventies''&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly this lengthening of hemlines coincided with the growth of the [[feminist]] movement.  However, in the 1960s the mini had been regarded as a symbol of liberation, and it was worn by some, such as [[Germaine Greer]] and, in the following decade, [[Gloria Steinem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/09/24/RV65259.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Making Ms.Story / The biography of Gloria Steinem, a woman of controversy and contradictions | first=Patricia | last=Holt | date=22 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greer herself wrote in 1969 that:

{{quote|The women kept on dancing while their long skirts crept up, and their [[girdle]]s dissolved, and their nipples burst through like hyacinth tips and their clothes withered away to the mere wisps and ghosts of draperies to adorn and glorify ...&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Germaine (1969-02). Germaine Greer in ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'', February 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although they disappeared from mainstream fashion by the mid-70s, miniskirts never entirely went away. This was evidenced by [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] of the group [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], who often wore miniskirts during the "new wave" era of the late 70s; and by the female cast members of the TV show ''[[Hee Haw]]'', who were known as the "Hee Haw Honeys," who always wore country-style minidresses even during the miniskirt's fashion hiatus in the late 70s and early 80s; and as mentioned above, by female tennis players, figure skaters, cheerleaders, and dancers. The song "(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea" (1978), by new wave artist [[Elvis Costello]], contained the line: "There's no place here for the mini-skirt waddle".{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===1980s and 1990s===
In spring of 1982, (see June ''Time Magazine'') short skirts began to re-emerge, notably in the form of "[[Rah-rah skirt|rah-rahs]]", which were modeled on those worn by female cheerleaders at sporting and other events. In 1985, the British designer [[Vivienne Westwood]] offered her first "mini-crini," an abbreviated version of the Victorian [[crinoline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff writer |title=Vivienne Westwood designs |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/vivienne-westwood-designs/ |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mini-length, bouffant silhouette inspired the puffball skirts widely presented by more established designers such as [[Christian Lacroix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cicolini|first1=Alice|last2=British Council|title=Inside out: underwear and style in the UK|date=2000|publisher=Black Dog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Caroline |editor1-last=Breward |editor1-first=Christopher |editor2-last=Ehrman |editor2-first=Edwina |editor3-last=Evans |editor3-first=Caroline |title=The London look : fashion from street to catwalk |date=2004 |page=149| publisher=Yale University Press / Museum of London |location=New Haven |isbn=9780300103991 |chapter=Cultural Capital 1976–2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Westwood's mini-crini was described as having combined two conflicting ideals – the crinoline, representing a "mythology of restriction and encumbrance in woman's dress", and the "equally dubious mythology of liberation" associated with the miniskirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Caroline |last2=Thornton |first2=Minna |title=Women and Fashion: A New Look |date=1989 |publisher=Quartet Books |location=London |isbn=9780704326910 |pages=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1980s, many women began to incorporate the miniskirt into their business attire, a trend which grew during the remainder of the century. The titular character of the 1990s television program ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', a lawyer portrayed by [[Calista Flockhart]], has been credited with popularising micro-skirts.&lt;ref name=standring&gt;{{cite news|last1=Standring|first1=Chris|title=Top Trends: Spring’s long skirts flatter every body|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/trends+spring+long+skirts+flatter+every+body/10787269/story.html|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=Edmonton Journal|agency=Postmedia Network Inc.|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
In the early 21st century micro-minis were once again revived.&lt;ref name=cumming/&gt;&lt;ref name=aniello/&gt; In 2003 [[Tom Ford]], at that time described as one of the few designers able to effortlessly dictate changes in fashion, stated that micro-skirts would be the height of fashion for Spring/Summer 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff writer|title=Gucci Spring/Summer 2003 Ready-To-Wear|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/spring-summer-2003/ready-to-wear/gucci/catwalk-report|website=Vogue|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=20 October 2015|date=29 September 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127044600/http://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/spring-summer-2003/ready-to-wear/gucci/catwalk-report|archivedate=27 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For fashionable wear, early 21st century microskirts were often worn with [[leggings]] or [[tights]] in order to avoid revealing too much.&lt;ref name=standring/&gt;&lt;ref name=aniello/&gt; At this time, an even briefer version of the micro-mini emerged, creating a garment sometimes described as a "belt-skirt."&lt;ref name=aniello&gt;{{cite news |author=Fulvio Aniello |title=Donne con la gonna|url=http://www.fashiontimes.it/2010/11/donne-con-la-gonna/|accessdate=20 October 2015|work=The Fashion Times|publisher=Drawers Media Srl|date=14 November 2010 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LG 시네마 3D TV 새 모델 ‘소녀시대’ 영입.jpg|thumb|left|Pop group [[Girls' Generation]] in various styles of mini- and micro-mini dresses. South Korea, 2012.]]

A BBC article in 2014 wrote that miniskirts remained as contemporary a garment as ever, retaining their associations with youth.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt; In an early 2010s study the department store [[Debenhams]] found that women continued buying miniskirts up to the age of 40, whilst 1983 studies showed that 33 years old was when the average woman had stopped buying them.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt; Debenham's report concluded that by the 2020s, miniskirts would be seen as a wardrobe staple for British women in their 40s and early 50s.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt;

Despite this, in the early 21st century, miniskirts are still seen as controversial, and remain subject to bans and regulation.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt; [[Valerie Steele]] told the BBC in 2014 that even though miniskirts no longer had the power to shock in most Western cultures, she would hesitate to wear one in most parts of the world.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt; She described the garment as symbolic of looking forward to future freedom and backwards to a "much more restricted past." and noted that international rises in extreme conservatism and religious fundamentalism had led to an [[misogyny|anti-women]] backlash, some of which was shown through censure and criticism of women wearing "immodest" clothing.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt; In 2010 the mayor of [[Castellammare di Stabia]] in Italy ordered that police fine women for wearing "very short" miniskirts.&lt;ref name=katya/&gt;&lt;ref name="ban"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Sam |last2=Kington |first2=Tom |title=Italian mayor seeks ban on miniskirts that reveal too much |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/25/italy-mayor-miniskirts-ban|accessdate=9 June 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, a ban on miniskirts at a teacher's college in [[Kemerovo]] was claimed by lawyers to be against the terms of equality and human rights as laid out by the Russian constitution, whilst in [[Chile]], the women's minister, [[Carolina Schmidt]], described a regional governor's ban on public employees wearing minis and [[strapless dress|strapless]] tops as "absolute nonsense" and challenged their right to regulate other people's clothing.&lt;ref name=ban/&gt; In July 2010, [[Southampton]] city council also tried to regulate their female employees's wardrobes, telling them to avoid miniskirts and dress "appropriately."&lt;ref name=ban/&gt;

Miniskirts regularly appear in Africa as part of controversies, something that has continued since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kiruga |first1=Morris |title=Understanding Africa's 'fashion gestapo': Miniskirts, maxi skirts make-up and long beards |url=http://m.mgafrica.com/article/2014-12-04-understanding-africas-fashion-police |accessdate=10 June 2016 |work=Mail and Guardian Africa |date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 21st century alone, instances have included a proposed ban on miniskirts in [[Uganda]] justified by claiming that they were a dangerous distraction to drivers and would cause road accidents, and in 2004, a leaflet campaign in [[Mombasa]] instructed women to dress modestly and "shun miniskirts", leading to the [[Kenya]]n government denying that they wanted a ban.&lt;ref name=ban/&gt; Since the 1990s, women perceived to be "indecently dressed" might be stripped in public often by gangs of men, but sometimes by other women.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; These acts took place in Kenya, [[Zambia]] and elsewhere, including incidents in [[Johannesburg]] in 2008 and 2011 which led to similar attacks in various states including [[Sudan]], [[Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; The President of Malawi, [[Bingu wa Mutharika]], was forced to make a statement in 2012 after male gangs forcibly stripped women in [[Lilongwe]] and [[Mzuzu]].&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; By this point, "miniskirt protests" regularly followed these acts of violence, with the protesters defiantly wearing miniskirts.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; In late February 2010, a group of about 200 Ugandan women demonstrated against a so-called "miniskirt law," an anti-pornography legislation which specifically forbade women to dress  "in a manner designed to sexually excite," or from wearing clothing that revealed their thighs and/or other body parts.&lt;ref name=ban/&gt; Uganda revisited their proposed ban in 2013, with [[Simon Lokodo]], Minister of Ethics and Integrity, proposing another anti-pornography bill which would outlaw revealing "intimate parts," defined as "anything above the knee," and vowing that women who wore miniskirts would be arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sevenzo|first1=Farai|title=Letter from Africa: Miniskirts and morals |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22375730|accessdate=10 June 2016|work=BBC News|date=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of these proposed bans come from male politicians, in 2009 [[Joice Mujuru]], Zimbabwe's Vice President, had to deal with rumours that she intended to ban miniskirts and trousers for women.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; In Africa, one of the main issues with the miniskirt since the 1960s is that it is seen as representative of protest against predominantly male authority, an accusation also applied to trousers for women which are perceived as blurring the gender divide.&lt;ref name=ross/&gt;&lt;ref name=ivaska/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

'''''Nakaz''''', or '''Instruction, of Catherine the Great''' ({{lang-ru|Наказ Екатерины II Комиссии о составлении проекта нового Уложения}}) was a statement of legal principles written by [[Catherine II of Russia]], and permeated with the ideas of the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It was compiled as a guide for the All-Russian Legislative Commission convened in 1767 for the purpose of replacing the mid-17th-century [[Sobornoe Ulozhenie|Muscovite code of laws]] with a modern law code. Catherine believed that to strengthen law and institutions was above all else to strengthen the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hosking, Russia: People and Empire(Harvard, 1997) p.98&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Instruction proclaimed the equality of all men before the law and disapproved of the death penalty and torture, thus anticipating some of the issues raised by the later [[United States Constitution]] and the [[Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791|Polish Constitution]]. Although the ideas of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] were emphatically upheld, the stance towards [[serfdom]] is more blurry: the chapter about peasants was retouched a number of times, as Catherine's views on the subject evolved.

Catherine worked on the Instruction for two years. In 1766, she showed the manuscript to her closest advisors, [[Nikita Panin]] and [[Grigory Orlov]], asking them to make changes as they thought necessary. In its final version, the Instruction consists of 22 chapters and 655 articles, which embrace various spheres of state, criminal, and civil law and procedure. More than 400 articles are copied verbatim from the works of [[Montesquieu]], [[Cesare Beccaria|Beccaria]], and other contemporary thinkers.

In 1767, Catherine sent the German edition to [[Frederick II of Prussia]] and the French one to [[Voltaire]]. She wrote to one of her correspondents that {{quote|for the benefit of my Empire I pillaged President [[Montesquieu]], without naming him in the text. I hope that if he had seen me at work, he would have forgiven this literary theft if only for the good of 20 million people which it may bring about. He loved the humanity too much to be offended; [[The Spirit of the Laws|his book]] was my [[breviary]].}}

The extant manuscript of the Instruction was written by Catherine in French. There is also a Russian translation by herself. On 10 August 1767 the Russian and German editions were printed in [[Moscow]]. The Latin and French editions followed in 1770. In 1769 [[Étienne François, duc de Choiseul|Duc de Choiseul]] had the Instruction officially prohibited in [[France]] as a "libertarian book". 

The Instruction generated much discussion among Russian intellectuals and exerted considerable influence on the course of the [[Russian Enlightenment]]. It was in this document that the basic tenets of the French Enlightenment were articulated in Russian for the first time. Catherine's work had little practical value however: the Legislative Commission failed to outline the new code of laws and the Instruction never circulated in Russia outside Moscow and St. Petersburg. 

[[Denis Diderot]], who visited Russia in 1774, penned an extensive critique of the Nakaz — ''Observations sur le Nakaz'' — which opens with a famous contention: "There is no true sovereign except the nation; there can be no true legislator except the people".

==Background==
[[Image:Catherine 2 nakaz.JPG|thumb|right|275px|Catherine the Great with the Nakaz]]
Catherine’s Instruction to the Legislative Commission gave an in-depth description of the state of the nation at the time it was written (1764).&lt;ref&gt;David L. Ransel, The Politics of Catherinian Russia:  The Panin Party (New Haven: Yale University, 1975), 181&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteen months in the making, the Nakaz was written with the intention of providing an unambiguous description of the existing laws.  Though Catherine based her writing heavily on the Enlightenment of Western Europe, she merely utilized some of the broader ideas of the movement, such as equality under the law, to strengthen autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas V. Riasanovsky, Mark D. Steinberg, A History of Russia, Vol. 1: to 1855 (Oxford: Oxford University, 2005), 255-56&lt;/ref&gt;  Montesquieu, whose works heavily influenced Catherine, wrote of such things as a divided government (where the power is split between the executive and legislative bodies) and a monarchy made up of three estates.&lt;ref&gt;Riasanovsky, Steinberg, A History of Russia, 256&lt;/ref&gt;  Catherine tactfully ignored these ideas in favor of an absolutist bureaucratic monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Ransel, The Politics of Catherinian Russia, 179&lt;/ref&gt;
	The Nakaz was written as a way to argue for the already existing system rather than bring about any serious change.  Borrowing heavily from Montesquieu’s Esprit des lois (“The Spirit of the Laws”) Catherine was careful to make small alterations of the original that brought it into conformity with her view of Russia as an absolutist bureaucratic monarchy that has offices to manage things like tax collection, police service, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ransel, The Politics of Catherinian Russia, 179&lt;/ref&gt;  It took several drafts and ample input from advisors before the final document was finished, by which time several more radical proposals were eliminated.  Catherine continued to listen to criticism and make changes to her work up until 1767, at which time two supplementary chapters were written.&lt;ref&gt;Ransel, The Politics of Catherinian Russia, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
	The Instruction is composed of a total of 22 chapters, 655 clauses, an introduction and a conclusion.  The first three chapters discuss the current state of the Russian Empire.  Chapters 4-10 discuss the existing code of laws as well as Catherine’s opinion of them.  The rest of the chapters excluding the last two discuss the people of Russia as a whole.  Chapters 21 and 22, the supplementary chapters, come after the conclusion and analyze the organization of the police and the state’s management of money, respectively.

==State of the Empire==
	Catherine begins her Instruction by stating that the nature of an empire is to move forward and constantly be progressing.  She goes on to say that the Christian duty of every worthwhile subject is to aid the nation with whatever skill they possess.  The first three chapters of the Nakaz describe the state of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Dukes (historian)|Paul Dukes]], Russia Under Catherine the Great, Vol. 2: Catherine the Great's Instruction (Nakaz) to the Legislative Commission, 1767 (Newtonville: Oriental Research Partners, 1978), 43&lt;/ref&gt;
	The body of the document starts by stating that Russia is a European power, and that the nation owes this to the reforms of [[Peter the Great]].  The next chapter specifies Russia’s territory as containing 32 degrees of Latitude, and 165 of Longitude on the globe.  In that chapter, Catherine says that an absolute monarchy is necessary to rule over such a vast realm.  Continuing to defend autocracy, she states “Another reason is, that it is better to obey the Laws under the direction of one Master, than to be subject to the Wills of many.”  Her final argument for autocracy is that an absolute government does not deprive people of liberty, but directs them so that they can contribute to the overall society to make it better.&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, Russia Under Catherine the Great, 44&lt;/ref&gt;
	Lastly, Catherine describes the power structure of Russia in this first section of the Instruction.  First there are the intermediate powers such as local judicatures, and then the Supreme powers which the inferior powers are subject to and dependent on.  However, the sovereign is the source of all power, both supreme and civil.  Catherine contradicts this notion later by saying that Russia is an absolute monarchy in which the leader voluntarily accepts limitations of the common law.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Dixon, Catherine the Great (New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2009), 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Inconsistencies like this prove that Catherine was trying to use the Enlightenment to enforce her autocratic regime.

==Law==
	A large portion of the rest of the Nakaz looks at law, more specifically, parts of the law such as crime, punishment, and trial.  In this section Catherine also talks about equal treatment under the law, the nature of law, and what liberty means in an autocratic state.  Though she does not explore the issue of serfdom very deeply, many of her more in-depth thoughts were expressed in previous drafts of her Instruction that were edited out.
	Catherine first states that law should have sanction and should provide equal protection to all.  The discussion of equal protection to all brought to the table the issue of serfdom.  Consideration was given to outright condemnation of the practice of serfdom, but Catherine was advised against such radical proposals; consequently in the final document, the discussion of the subject is limited to her criticism and condemnation of physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Catherine the Great, 172&lt;/ref&gt;
	The Instruction explores the nature of law, or more specifically, how laws of different cultures come about.  Catherine cites the cultures of “savage nations”, China, Japan, Lacedaemonians (Spartans), Rome, and Spain as examples of how elements such as climate, resources, and general manner of the people affect the development of their individual cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, Russia Under Catherine the Great, 47&lt;/ref&gt;
	The discussion of culture and law is followed by views on punishment and how crime should be measured and how punishment should relate to crime.  Catherine states that there are four types of offenses:  crimes against religion, crimes against morals, crimes that disturb the peace, and crimes that affect the security of the citizens.  Here Catherine takes her stance on torture and condemns the practice as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, Russia Under Catherine the Great, 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to other arguments made on the issue of crime and punishment, it came to be widely believed that Catherine was of the school of thought that suggested it is better to let ten guilty men go free than to convict a single innocent man.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Catherine the Great, 171&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, there is no such passage in the Instruction.
	Her writings about how the judicial system should be viewed were radical at the time.  She believed in the importance of a judge, jury, and witnesses, but claimed that the way police were viewed in society was wrong.  Police, in her opinion, were meant to uncover crime, not exact justice, and this issue was looked at more closely in supplements she added to the text later.  She went so far as to say that being arrested “ought not to be looked upon as a punishment, but rather as the means of preserving the person of the accused in safety, which assure him at the same time of his liberty, provided he is innocent.”&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, Russia Under Catherine the Great, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The final section of the body of the Nakaz is devoted to statistics and theories about the people of Russia.  Catherine takes another look at serfdom and the ethics of the practice.  Other areas she covers are marriage, taxes, trade and manufacture, education, the nobility, the middle class, the role of towns in the Russian infrastructure, and the practice of inheritance and will making.  Catherine concludes her instruction by stating that this work takes careful reading and that everyone should take the time to try to understand it.  She wanted it to be read every month at the assembly of the Legislative Commission until a new code of laws had been finished.  She also wrote that she knew her Instruction could not be perfect so she permitted the Legislative Commission to request changes to the document.&lt;ref&gt;Dukes, Russia Under Catherine the Great, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|"Pinakes" may be plural of [[pinax]], a votive tablet that served as a votive object deposited in a sanctuary or burial chamber.}}
[[Image:Ancientlibraryalex.jpg|thumb|Imaginary depiction of the [[Library of Alexandria]]]]
The '''''Pinakes''''' ({{lang-grc|Πίνακες}} "tables", plural of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πίναξ|πίναξ]]}}) is a lost [[bibliography|bibliographic]] work composed by [[Callimachus]] (310/305–240 BCE) that is popularly considered to be the first [[library catalog]]; its contents were based upon the holdings of the [[Library of Alexandria]] during Callimachus' tenure there during the third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;N. Krevans 2002: 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Library of Alexandria had been founded by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] about 306 BCE. The first recorded librarian was [[Zenodotus]] of Ephesus. During Zenodotus' tenure, Callimachus, who was never the head librarian, compiled the ''Pinakes'', thus becoming the first bibliographer and the scholar who organized the library by authors and subjects about 245 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Hopkinson, ''A Hellenistic Anthology'' (CUP, 1988) 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="alexandria3"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greekplanet.com.au/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t486.html|title=
Greek Inventions|accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was 120 volumes long.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkinson&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apollonius of Rhodes]] was the successor to Zenodotus. [[Eratosthenes]] of Cyrene succeeded Apollonius in 235 BCE and compiled his ''tetagmenos epi teis megaleis bibliothekeis'', the "scheme of the great bookshelves." In 195 BCE [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] was the librarian and updated the ''Pinakes'',&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, R. ''History of Classical Scholarship from the Beginnings to the End of the Hellenistic Age'' (OUP, 1968) 133.&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also possible that his work was not a supplement of Callimachus' ''Pinakes'' themselves, but an independent polemic against, or commentary upon, their contents.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, W.J. "Grammarians on Handwashing", ''Phoenix'' 43 (1989) 100&amp;ndash;11, at 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The collection at the Library of Alexandria contained nearly 500,000 [[papyrus]] scrolls, which were grouped together by subject matter and stored in bins.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Parson, "Libraries", in the ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 3rd ed. (OUP, 1996) describes the evidence for the size of the library's holdings thus: "The first Ptolemies (see Ptolemy (1) ) collected ambitiously and systematically; the Alexandrian Library (see ALEXANDRIA (1) ) became legend, and *Callimachus (3)'s ''Pinakes'' made its content accessible. There were rivals at *Pella, *Antioch (1) (where *Euphorion (2) was librarian), and especially *Pergamum. Holdings were substantial: if the figures can be trusted, Pergamum held at least 200,000 rolls (Plut. ''Ant.'' 58. 9), the main library at Alexandria nearly 500,000 (*Tzetzes, ''Prolegomena de comoedia'' 11a. 2. 10–11 Koster)&amp;mdash;the equivalent, perhaps, of 100,000 modern books."&lt;/ref&gt; Each bin carried a label with painted tablets hung above the stored papyri. ''Pinakes'' was named after these tablets and are a set of index lists. The bins gave bibliographical information for every roll.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Heather A., [http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm "The Great Library of Alexandria?". Library Philosophy and Practice, August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A typical entry started with a title and also provided the author's name, birthplace, father's name, any teachers trained under, and educational background. It contained a brief biography of the author and a list of the author's publications. The entry had the first line of the work, a summary of its contents, the name of the author, and information about the origin of the roll.&lt;ref name ="alexandria4"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.greece.org/hec01/www/arts-culture/alexandria/library/library11.htm|title= The Pinakes|accessdate= 2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Callimachus' system divided works into six [[genres]] and five sections of prose: rhetoric, law, epic, tragedy, comedy, lyric poetry, history, medicine, mathematics, natural science, and miscellanies. Each category was alphabetized by author.

Callimachus composed two other works that were referred as ''pinakes'' and were probably somewhat similar in format to the ''Pinakes'' (of which they "may or may not be subsections"&lt;ref&gt;Nita Krevans, "Callimachus and the Pedestrian Muse," in M.A. harder et al., eds., ''Callimachus II'' (Hellenistica Groningana 7), 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CL4A5I3K-KsC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=callimachus%20democritus%20catalog&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 173] n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;), but were concerned with individual topics. These are listed by the ''[[Suda]]'' as: ''A Chronological Pinax and Description of [[Theatre director#The director in theatre history|Didaskaloi]] from the Beginning'' and ''Pinax of the Vocabulary and Treatises of [[Democritus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-entries/kappa/227|title=SOL Search|website=www.stoa.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later bibliographic ''pinakes''==
The term ''pinax'' was used for bibliographic catalogs beyond Callimachus. For example, [[Ptolemy-el-Garib]]'s catalog of [[Aristotle]]'s writings comes to us with the title ''Pinax (catalog) of Aristotle's writings''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ingemar Düring]], ''Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition'' (Göteborg 1957), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The ''Pinakes'' proved indispensable to librarians for centuries, and they became a model for [[Knowledge organization|organizing knowledge]] throughout the [[Mediterranean]]. Their later influence can be traced to medieval times, even to the Arabic counterpart of the tenth century: [[Ibn al-Nadim]]'s ''Al-Fihrist'' ("Index").&lt;ref name ="alexandria4"/&gt;   Local variations for [[cataloging]] and [[library classification]] continued throughout the late 1800s, when [[Anthony Panizzi]] and [[Melvil Dewey]] paved the way for more shared and standardized approaches.

The concept of the '''primordial sandwich''' was proposed by the [[chemist]] [[Günter Wächtershäuser]] to describe the possible origins of the first [[cell membrane]]s, and, therefore, the first cell.&lt;ref name="pallen-2011"/&gt;

According to the two main models of [[abiogenesis]], [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]] and [[iron-sulfur world theory|iron-sulfur world]], prebiotic&lt;ref&gt;From the roots pre (meaning before) and biotic (referring to life), the word '''prebiotic''' can refer to the time before life appeared on the earth or any other planet with the capacity to harbor it.&lt;/ref&gt; processes existed ''before'' the development of the cell membrane. The difficulty with this idea, however, is that it is almost impossible to create a complex molecule such as RNA (or even its molecular precursor, pre-RNA) directly from simple organic molecules dissolved in a global ocean (Joyce, 1991), because without some mechanism to concentrate these organic molecules, they would be too dilute to generate the necessary [[chemical reaction]]s to transform them from simple organic molecules into genuine prebiotic molecules.

To address this problem, Wächtershäuser proposed that concentration might occur by concentration upon ("[[adsorption]] to") the surfaces of minerals. With the accumulation of enough [[amphipathic]] molecules (such as [[phospholipid]]s), a [[bilayer]] will self-organize, and any molecules caught inside will become the contents of a [[liposome]], and would be concentrated enough to allow chemical reactions to transform organic molecules into prebiotic molecules.

Although developed for his own iron-sulfur world model, the idea of the ''primordial sandwich'' has also been adopted by some adherents of the [[RNA world]] model.

The '''''Prieuré de Sion''''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁi.jœ.ʁe də sjɔ̃|}}), translated as '''Priory of Sion''', is a fringe [[fraternal organisation]], founded and dissolved in [[France]] in 1956 by [[Pierre Plantard]] as part of a hoax. In the 1960s, Plantard created a fictitious history for that organization, describing it as a [[secret society]] founded by [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] on [[Mount Zion]] in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] in 1099, conflating it with a genuine historical monastic order, the [[Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion]]. In Plantard's version, the Priory was devoted to installing a secret [[bloodline]] of the [[Merovingian dynasty]] on the thrones of France and the rest of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=moreorless.net |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2005/pa_introvigne.htm |title=CESNUR 2005 International Conference – Beyond The Da Vinci Code: History and Myth of the Priory of Sion, by Massimo Introvigne |publisher=Cesnur.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[mythology|myth]] was expanded upon and popularised by the 1982 [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]]&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 21 by Cory James Rushton, "Twenty-First-Century Templar", p. 236, in Gail Ashton (editor), ''Medieval Afterlives in Contemporary Culture'' (Bloomsbury Academic, 2015. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-2960-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt; book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]''&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"&gt;Henry Lincoln, Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'', Corgi, 1982. {{ISBN|0-552-12138-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later presented in the preface of the 2003 novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref name="DVC"&gt;Dan Brown, ''The Da Vinci Code'', Doubleday, 2003. {{ISBN|0-385-50420-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' from the late 1960s to the 1980s, the mythical Priory of Sion was exposed as a [[ludibrium]] created by Plantard as a framework for his claim of being the [[Last Roman Emperor|Great Monarch]] prophesied by [[Nostradamus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Plantard, ''Gisors et son secret...'', ORBIS, 1961, abridged version contained in Gérard de Sède, ''Les Templiers sont parmi nous''. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence presented in support of its historical existence and activities before 1956 was discovered to have been forged and then planted in various locations around France by Plantard and his accomplices. Nevertheless, many [[conspiracy theorist]]s still [[true-believer syndrome|persist in believing]] that the Priory of Sion is an age-old [[cabal]] that conceals a [[subversion|subversive]] secret.&lt;ref name="Putnam"&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château. A Mystery Solved'', Sutton Publishers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Priory of Sion myth has been exhaustively [[debunker|debunked]] by journalists and scholars as one of the greatest [[hoax]]es of the 20th century.&lt;ref name =CBS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1552009.shtml |title='&amp;#39;The Secret of the Priory of Sion'&amp;#39;, '60 Minutes', 30 April 2006, presented by Ed Bradley, produced by Jeanne Langley, CBS News |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[skeptic]]s have expressed concern that the proliferation and popularity of books, websites and films inspired by this hoax have contributed to the subject of [[List of conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]], [[pseudohistory]] and other confusions becoming more [[mainstream]].&lt;ref name="Thompson 13/01/2008"&gt;[[Damian Thompson]], a"for [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/12/nrfact212.xml How Da Vinci Code tapped pseudo-fact hunger]", ''Daily Telegraph''. 2008.

==History==
The [[fraternal organisation]] was founded in the town of [[Annemasse]], [[Haute-Savoie]] in eastern France in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcaminosantiago.com/PDF/Book/The_Real_History_Behind_The_Da_Vinci_Code.pdf Sharan Newman.

The Headquarters of the Priory of Sion and its journal ''Circuit'' were based in the apartment of Plantard, in a social housing block known as Sous-Cassan newly constructed in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Gavard, ''Histoire d'Annemasse et des communes voisines: les relations avec Genève de l'époque romaine à l'an 2000'' (Montmélian: la Fontaine de Siloé, impr. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Sanchez Da Motta, ''Do Enigma de Rennes-le-Château ao Priorado de Siao – Historia de um Mito Moderno'', Esquilo, 2005, p. 322, reproducing the Priory of Sion Registration Document showing the group was based in Plantard's apartment.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The founders and signatories inscribed with their real names and aliases were Pierre Plantard, also known as "Chyren", and André Bonhomme, also known as "Stanis Bellas". Bonhomme was the President while Plantard was the Secretary General.  The registration documents also included the names of Jean Deleaval as the Vice-President and Armand Defago as the Treasurer. The offices of the Priory of Sion and its journal ''Circuit'' were located at Plantard's apartment. 

The choice of the name "Sion" was based on a popular local feature, a hill south of Annemasse in France, known as Mont Sion, where the founders intended to establish a [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] center.&lt;ref name="Bradley 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bradley | first = Ed | authorlink = Ed Bradley | title = The Priory Of Sion: Is The "Secret Organization" Fact Or Fiction? | year = 2006 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1552009_page2.shtml | accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying title to the name was "''Chevalerie d'Institutions et Règles Catholiques d'Union Indépendante et Traditionaliste''": this subtitle forms the acronym CIRCUIT and translates in English as Chivalry of Catholic Rules and Institutions of Independent and Traditionalist Union".

The statutes of the Priory of Sion indicate its purpose was to allow and encourage members to engage in studies and [[social work with groups#Mutual aid|mutual aid]]. The articles of the association expressed the goal of creating a [[Traditionalist Catholic]] [[chivalric order]].&lt;ref name="Jean-Luc Chaumeil"&gt;"Les Archives du Prieuré de Sion", ''Le Charivari'', N°18, 1973. Containing a transcript of the 1956 Statutes of the Priory of Sion.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Article 7 of the statutes of the Priory of Sion stated that its members were expected "to carry out good deeds, to help the Roman Catholic Church, teach the truth, defend the weak and the oppressed". Towards the end of 1956 the association had planned to forge partnerships with the local Catholic Church of the area which would have involved a school bus service run by both the Priory of Sion and the church of Saint-Joseph in Annemasse.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cailleboite, "A Sous-Cassan et aux pervenches un missionnaire regarde la vie ouvriere", ''Circuit'', Numéro spécial, October 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantard is described as the President of the Tenants' Association of Annemasse in the issues of ''Circuit''.

The bulk of the activities of the Priory of Sion, however, bore no resemblance to the objectives as outlined in its statutes: ''Circuit'', the official journal of the Priory of Sion, was indicated as a news bulletin of an "organisation for the defence of the rights and the freedom of affordable housing" rather than for the promotion of chivalry-inspired charitable work. The first issue of the journal is dated 27 May 1956, and, in total, twelve issues appeared. Some of the articles took a political position in the local council elections. Others criticised and even attacked real-estate developers of Annemasse.&lt;ref name="Jean-Luc Chaumeil"/&gt;

According to a letter written by Léon Guersillon the Mayor of Annemasse in 1956, contained in the folder holding the 1956 Statutes of the Priory of Sion in the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois, Plantard was given a six-month sentence in 1953 for fraud.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of a Mystery'', BBC 2, transmitted on 17 September 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The formally registered association was dissolved some time after October 1956 but intermittently revived for different reasons by Plantard between 1961 and 1993, though in name and on paper only. The Priory of Sion is considered dormant by the subprefecture because it has indicated no activities since 1956. According to French law, subsequent references to the Priory bear no legal relation to that of 1956 and no one, other than the original signatories, is entitled to use its name in an official capacity.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

André Bonhomme played no part in the association after 1956. He officially resigned in 1973 when he heard that Plantard was linking his name with the association. In light of Plantard's death in 2000, there is no one who is currently alive who has official permission to use the name.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Archives de Rennes-le-Château'', Tome II, Editions Belisane, 1988, p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Gino Sandri (former secretary to Pierre Plantard) announced the revival of Priory of Sion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rennes-le-chateau.org/rlctoday/int-sandri.asp Gino Sandri, Secrétaire du Prieuré de Sion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101215314/http://www.rennes-le-chateau.org/rlctoday/int-sandri.asp |date=1 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myth==

===Plantard's plot===
Plantard set out to have the Priory of Sion perceived as a prestigious [[esoteric Christian]] chivalric order, whose members would be [[Éminence grise|people of influence]] in the fields of finance, politics and philosophy, devoted to installing the "[[Great Catholic Monarch|Great Monarch]]", prophesied by [[Nostradamus]], on the throne of France. Plantard's choice of the pseudonym "Chyren" was a reference to "Chyren Selin", Nostradamus's [[anagram]] for the name for this [[Christian eschatology|eschatological]] figure.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-France Etchegoin &amp; Frédéric Lenoir, ''Code Da Vinci: L'Enquête'', p. 61 (Robert Laffont, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1961 and 1984, Plantard contrived a mythical pedigree for the Priory of Sion claiming that it was the offshoot of a real [[Roman Catholic religious order]] housed in the Abbey of Our Lady of Mount Zion, which had been founded in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] during the [[First Crusade]] in 1099 and later absorbed by the [[Jesuits]] in 1617. The mistake is often made that this Abbey of Sion was a Priory of Sion, but there is a difference between an [[abbey]] and a [[priory]].&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Introvigne | first = Massimo | authorlink = Massimo Introvigne | title = Beyond The Da Vinci Code: History and Myth of the Priory of Sion | year = 2005 | url = http://www.cesnur.org/2005/pa_introvigne.htm | accessdate=16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling his original 1956 group "Priory of Sion" presumably gave Plantard the later idea to claim that his organisation had been historically founded by crusading knight [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] on [[Mount Zion]] near [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Putnam"/&gt;

[[File:Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version).jpg|thumb|left|200px|The cryptic phrase "''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]''" in [[Nicolas Poussin]]'s late 1630s painting ''[[Et in Arcadia ego|Arcadian Shepherds]]'' was appropriated for Priory of Sion [[myth-making]], first utilised in 1964.]]Furthermore, Plantard was inspired by a 1960 magazine ''Les Cahiers de l'Histoire'' to center his personal genealogical claims, as found in the "Priory of Sion documents", on the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] king [[Dagobert II]], who had been assassinated in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Chaumeil, ''La Table d'Isis ou Le Secret de la Lumière'', Editions Guy Trédaniel, 1994, pp. 121–124.&lt;/ref&gt; He also adopted ''"[[Et in Arcadia ego]]&amp;nbsp;..."'', a slightly altered version of a [[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] that most famously appears as the title of two paintings by [[Nicolas Poussin]], as the [[motto]] of both his family and the Priory of Sion,&lt;ref&gt;Madeleine Blancassall, "Les Descendants Mérovingiens ou l’énigme du Razès wisigoth" (1965), in: Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Mystères de Rennes-le-Château, Mélanges Sulfureux'', CERT, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; because the tomb which appears in these paintings resembled one in the Les Pontils area near [[Rennes-le-Château]]. This tomb would become a symbol for his [[dynastic]] claims as the last legacy of the Merovingians on the territory of [[Razès]], left to remind the select few who have been initiated into these [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]] that the "lost king", Dagobert II, would figuratively come back in the form of a hereditary [[pretender]].&lt;ref name="Jean Delaude 1994"&gt;Jean Delaude, ''Le Cercle d’Ulysse'' (1977), in: Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Mystères de Rennes-le-Château, Mélanges Sulfureux'', CERT, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A photograph of a young Thomas Plantard de Saint-Clair standing next to the Les Pontils tomb was published in Jean-Pierre Deloux, Jacques Brétigny, ''Rennes-le-Château – Capitale Secrète de l'Histoire de France'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

To give credibility to the fabricated lineage and pedigree, Plantard and his friend, [[Philippe de Chérisey]], needed to create "independent evidence". So during the 1960s, they created and deposited a series of [[false document]]s, the most famous of which was entitled ''[[Dossiers Secrets|Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau]]'' ("The Secret Files of Henri Lobineau"), at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris. During the same decade, Plantard commissioned de Chérisey to forge two medieval [[parchment]]s. These parchments contained encrypted messages that referred to the Priory of Sion. 

They adapted, and used to their advantage, the earlier false claims put forward by [[Noël Corbu]] that a Catholic priest named [[Bérenger Saunière]] had supposedly discovered ancient parchments inside a pillar while renovating his church in [[Rennes-le-Château]] in 1891. Inspired by the popularity of media reports and books in France about the discovery of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] in the [[West Bank]], they hoped this same theme would attract attention to their parchments.&lt;ref name="ChaumTest"&gt;Jean-Luc Chaumeil (Goeroe of speculative freemason), ''Rennes-le-Château – Gisors – Le Testament du Prieuré de Sion. Le Crépuscule d’une Ténébreuse Affaire'', Éditions Pégase, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their version of the parchments was intended to prove Plantard's claims about the Priory of Sion being a medieval society that was the source of the "[[Alfeios|underground stream]]" of [[esotericism]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Putnam"/&gt;

Plantard then enlisted the aid of author [[Gérard de Sède]] to write a book based on his unpublished manuscript and forged parchments,&lt;ref name="ChaumTest"/&gt; alleging that Saunière had discovered a link to a hidden treasure. The 1967 book ''L'or de Rennes, ou La vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château'' ("The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of Bérenger Saunière, Priest of Rennes-le-Château"), which was later published in paperback under the title ''Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Château'' ("The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Château") in 1968, became a popular read in France. It included copies of the found parchments (the originals were, of course, never produced), though it did not provide the decoded hidden texts contained within them. One of the Latin texts in the parchments was copied from the ''[[New Testament|Novum Testamentum]]'', an attempted restoration of the [[Vulgate]] by [[John Wordsworth]] and Henry White.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, A Mystery Solved'', Sutton Publishing, revised 2005 paperback edition, pp. 189–192. {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The other text was copied from the [[Codex Bezae]].&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, A Mystery Solved'', Sutton Publishing, revised 2005 paperback edition ({{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}). This book mentions Dr Wieland Willker’s identification of the smaller “parchment” with the Codex Bezae.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the wording used, the versions of the Latin texts found in the parchments can be shown to have been copied from books first published in 1889 and 1895, which is problematic considering that de Sède's book was trying to make a case that these documents were centuries old.

In 1969, English actor and science-fiction scriptwriter [[Henry Lincoln]] became intrigued after reading ''Le Trésor Maudit''. He discovered one of the encrypted messages, which read "''À Dagobert II Roi et à Sion est ce trésor, et il est là mort''" ("To Dagobert II, King, and to Sion belongs this treasure and he is there dead"). This was possibly an allusion to the tomb and [[shrine]] of [[Sigebert IV]], a real or mythical son of Dagobert II which would not only prove that the Merovingian dynasty did not end with the death of the king, but that the Priory of Sion has been entrusted with the duty to protect his [[relic]]s like a treasure.&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"/&gt; 

Lincoln expanded on the conspiracy theories, writing his own books on the subject, and inspiring and presenting three [[BBC Two]] [[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]] documentaries between 1972 and 1979 about the alleged mysteries of the Rennes-le-Château area. In response to a tip from Gérard de Sède, Lincoln claims he was also the one who discovered the ''Dossiers Secrets'', a series of planted genealogies which appeared to further confirm the link with the extinct Merovingian bloodline. The documents claimed that the Priory of Sion and the [[Knights Templar]] were two fronts of one unified organisation with the same leadership until 1188.&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"/&gt;

Letters in existence dating from the 1960s written by Plantard, de Chérisey and de Sède to each other confirm that the three were engaging in an out-and-out [[hoax]].  The letters describe schemes to combat criticisms of their various allegations and ways they would make up new allegations to try to keep the hoax alive. These letters (totalling over 100) are in the possession of French researcher Jean-Luc Chaumeil, who has also retained the original envelopes.

A letter later discovered at the subprefecture of Saint-Julien-en-Genevois also indicated that Plantard had a criminal conviction as a [[confidence trick]]ster.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of a Mystery'', BBC 2, transmitted on 17 September 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Secret of the Priory of Sion'', CBS News '60 Minutes', transmitted on 30 April 2006, presented by Ed Bradley, produced By Jeanne Langley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''===
{{details|The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail}}

After reading ''Le Trésor Maudit'', Lincoln persuaded [[BBC Two]] to devote three episodes in their ''Chronicle'' documentary series to the topic. These became quite popular and generated thousands of responses. Lincoln then joined forces with [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] for further research. This led them to the pseudohistorical ''[[Dossiers Secrets]]'' at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], which though alleging to portray hundreds of years of medieval history, were actually all written by Plantard and de Chérisey under the pseudonym of "Philippe Toscan du Plantier".

Unaware that the documents had been forged, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh used them as a major source for their 1982 controversial non-fiction book ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,''&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1982"/&gt; in which they presented the following [[factoid|myths as facts]] to support their hypotheses:&lt;ref name="Thompson 13/01/2008"/&gt;
* there is a [[secret society]] known as the Priory of Sion, which has a long history starting in 1099, and had illustrious [[Priory of Sion#Alleged Grand Masters|Grand Masters]] including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Isaac Newton]];
* it created the [[Knights Templar]] as its military arm and financial branch; and
* it is devoted to installing the [[Merovingian dynasty]], that ruled the [[Franks]] from 457 to 751, on the thrones of France and the rest of Europe.

However, the authors re-interpreted the ''Dossiers Secrets'' in the light of their own interest in undermining the Roman Catholic Church's institutional reading of [[Judeo-Christian]] history.&lt;ref&gt;''Conspiracies On Trial: The Da Vinci Code'' (The Discovery Channel); transmitted on 10 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Plantard's initial [[French Israelism|Franco-Israelist]] claim that the Merovingians were only descended from the [[Tribe of Benjamin]],&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Mystères de Rennes-le-Château: Mèlange Sulfureux'' (CERT, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; they asserted that:
* the Priory of Sion protects Merovingian [[dynast]]s because they may be the lineal [[Jesus bloodline|descendants of the historical Jesus]] and his alleged wife, [[Mary Magdalene]], traced further back to [[King David]];
* the legendary [[Holy Grail]] is simultaneously the womb of [[saint]] Mary Magdalene and the sacred [[royal descent|royal bloodline]] she gave birth to; and
* the Church tried to kill off all remnants of this bloodline and their supposed guardians, the [[Cathars]] and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], so [[popes]] could hold the [[episcopal throne]] through the [[apostolic succession]] of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] without fear of it ever being [[usurper|usurped]] by an [[antipope]] from the [[primogeniture|hereditary succession]] of Mary Magdalene.

The authors therefore concluded that the modern goals of the Priory of Sion are:
* the public revelation of the tomb and shrine of [[Sigebert IV]] as well as the [[Arch of Titus#Significance in Jewish history|lost treasure]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], which supposedly contains genealogical records that prove the Merovingian dynasty was of the [[Davidic line]], to facilitate Merovingian restoration in France;
* the re-institutionalization of [[chivalry]] and the promotion of [[pan-European nationalism]];
* the establishment of a [[theocracy|theocratic]] "[[United States of Europe]]": a Holy European Empire politically and religiously unified through the [[imperial cult]] of a Merovingian [[Great Catholic Monarch|Great Monarch]] who occupies both the throne of Europe and the [[Holy See]]; and
* the actual governance of Europe residing with the Priory of Sion through a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[European Parliament]].

The authors also incorporated the [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] tract known as ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' into their story, concluding that it was actually based on the master plan of the Priory of Sion. They presented it as the most persuasive piece of evidence for the existence and activities of the Priory of Sion by arguing that:
* the original text on which the published version of ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' was based had nothing to do with [[Judaism]] or an "[[Jewish world domination|international Jewish conspiracy]]". It issued from a [[Masonic body]] practicing the [[Scottish Rite]] which incorporated the word "[[Zion]]" in its name;
* the original text was not intended to be released publicly, but was a program for gaining control of [[Freemasonry]] as part of a strategy to infiltrate and reorganise church and state according to [[esoteric Christian]] principles;
* after a failed attempt to gain influence in the court of Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], [[Sergei Nilus]] changed the original text to forge an inflammatory tract in 1903 to discredit the esoteric clique around [[Papus]] by implying they were [[Judaeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Judaeo-Masonic conspirators]]; and
* some esoteric Christian elements in the original text were ignored by Nilus and hence remained unchanged in the [[antisemitic canard]] he published.

In reaction to this [[memetic engineering|memetic synthesis]] of investigative journalism with religious [[conspiracism]], many secular conspiracy theorists added the Priory of Sion to their list of [[secret societies]] collaborating or competing to manipulate political happenings from behind the scenes in their bid for [[Hegemony|world domination]].&lt;ref name="Moench 1995"&gt;Doug Moench, ''Factoid Books. The Big Book of Conspiracies'', Paradox Press, 1995. {{ISBN|1-56389-186-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[list of occultists|occultists]] speculated that the emergence of the Priory of Sion and Plantard closely follows ''The Prophecies by M. Michel Nostradamus'' (unaware that Plantard was [[self-fulfilling prophecy|intentionally trying to fulfill]] them).&lt;ref&gt;Marie-France Etchegoin &amp; Frédéric Lenoir, ''Code Da Vinci: L’Enquête'', p. 61 (Robert Laffont; 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Fringe [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatologists]] countered that it was a fulfilment of [[prophecies]] found in the [[Book of Revelation]] and further proof of an [[Antichrist|anti-Christian]] conspiracy of epic proportions.&lt;ref name="Aho 1997"&gt;Barbara Aho, "[http://www.watch.pair.com/merovingian.html The Merovingian Dynasty. Satanic Bloodline of the Antichrist and False Prophet]", watchpair.com, 1997. Retrieved on 29 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, professional historians and scholars from related fields do not accept ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' as a serious dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kemp, Professor of Art History at Oxford University, on the documentary ''The History of a Mystery'', BBC Two, transmitted on 17 September 1996, commenting on books like ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'': "There are certain historical problems, of which the Turin Shroud is one, in which there is 'fantastic fascination' with the topic, but a historical vacuum – a lack of solid evidence – and where there's a vacuum – nature abhores a vacuum – and historical speculation abhors a vacuum – and it all floods in...But what you end up with is almost nothing tangible or solid. You start from a hypothesis, and then that is deemed to be demonstrated more-or-less by stating the speculation, you then put another speculation on top of that, and you end up with this great tower of hypotheses and speculations – and if you say 'where are the rocks underneath this?' they are not there. It's like the House on Sand, it washes away as soon as you ask really hard questions of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

French authors like Franck Marie (1978),&lt;ref&gt;Franck Marie, ''Rennes-le-Château: Etude Critique'' (SRES, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Jarnac (1985),&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Histoire du Trésor de Rennes-le-Château'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Les Archives de Rennes-le-Château'' (Editions Belisane, 1988). Describing ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail'' as a "monument of mediocrity".&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Luc Chaumeil (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Chaumeil,''La Table d'Isis ou Le Secret de la Lumière'' (Editions Guy Trédaniel, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently Marie-France Etchegoin and Frédéric Lenoir (2004),&lt;ref&gt;Marie-France Etchegoin &amp; Frédéric Lenoir, ''Code Da Vinci: L'Enquête'' (Robert Laffont, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massimo Introvigne]] (2005),&lt;ref&gt;Massimo Introvigne, ''Gli Illuminati E Il Priorato Di Sion - La Verita Sulle Due Societa Segrete Del Codice Da Vinci Di Angeli E Demoni'' (Piemme; 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Jacques Bedu (2005),&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Bedu, ''Les sources secrètes du Da Vinci Code'' (Editions du Rocher, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; and Bernardo Sanchez Da Motta (2005),&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Sanchez Da Motta, ''Do Enigma de Rennes-le-Château ao Priorado de Siao – Historia de um Mito Moderno'' (Esquilo, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; have never taken Plantard and the Priory of Sion as seriously as Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh. They eventually concluded that it was all a [[hoax]], outlining in detail the reasons for their verdict, and giving detailed evidence that the ''Holy Blood'' authors had not reported comprehensively.&lt;ref name="Miller 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Miller | first = Laura | title = The Last Word; The Da Vinci Con | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0DD103AF931A15751C0A9629C8B63 | accessdate=16 July 2008 | date=22 February 2004 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; They imply that this evidence had been ignored by Lincoln, Baigent, and Leigh to bolster the mythical version of the Priory's history that was developed by Plantard during the early 1960s after meeting author [[Gérard de Sède]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2004"/&gt;

=== ''The Messianic Legacy'' ===
In 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh published ''The Messianic Legacy'', a sequel to ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''. The authors assert that the Priory of Sion is not only ''the'' archetypal [[cabal]] but an ideal repository of the cultural legacy of [[Jewish messianism]] that could end the “crisis of [[Meaning of life|meaning]]” within the [[Western world]] by providing a Merovingian [[sacred king]] as a [[Messiah|messianic figure]] in which the West and, by extension, humanity can place its trust. However, the authors are led to believe by Plantard that he has resigned as [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an internal power struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” as well as a campaign of [[character assassination]] against Plantard in the press and books written by skeptics.&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baigent, Michael |author2=Leigh, Richard |author3=Lincoln, Henry | title = The Messianic Legacy| publisher = Henry Holt &amp; Co | year = 1987| isbn = 0-8050-0568-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh remain convinced that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion is true, they confess to the possibility that all of Plantard's claims about a post-1956 Priory of Sion were part of an elaborate [[hoax]] to build a [[cult of personality]] and [[The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence#In popular culture|cult of intelligence]] around himself in French [[esotericism|esoteric]] circles.&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1987"/&gt;

===Revised myth===
In 1989, Plantard tried but failed to salvage his reputation and agenda as a [[mystagogue]] in esoteric circles by claiming that the Priory of Sion had actually been founded in 1681 at [[Rennes-le-Château]], and was focused more on harnessing the [[paranormal]] power of [[ley line]]s and sunrise lines,&lt;ref&gt;The ley line is from "Fauteil du Diable" to "Fortin de Blanchefort", intersected by a sunrise line of 17 January from the church of Rennes-les-Bains to the church of Rennes-le-Château, in ''Vaincre'', page 19 (June 1989). This was first given, in much more complex form, in Philippe de Chérisey's 1975 document ''L'Or de Rennes pour un Napoléon'' (Bibliothèque Nationale; Tolbiac – Rez-de-jardin – magasin 4- LB44- 2360).&lt;/ref&gt; and a promontory called "Roc Noir" (Black Rock) in the area,&lt;ref&gt;Quoting from Plantard's letter dated 4 April 1989: "Our Treasure, that of the Priory of Sion, is the Secret of the Roc Noir. Venerated since high antiquity by those who believed in its immense power..."&lt;/ref&gt; than installing a Merovingian [[pretender]] on the restored throne of France. In 1990, Plantard revised himself by claiming he was only descended from a [[cadet branch]] of the line of Dagobert II, while arguing that the direct descendant was really [[Otto von Habsburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Pierre Plantard: "If anyone can claim to be a descendant of Sigisbert IV in the direct line it can only be Otto von Habsburg, and he alone. To all those people who write to me I have given this same reply." From ''Vaincre – Reprend le titre d'un périodique paru en 1942–1943'', Number 1, April 1990 {{cite web |url=http://jhaldezos.free.fr/lespersonnages/plantard/images/Vaincre%20avril%201990.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818232934/http://jhaldezos.free.fr/lespersonnages/plantard/images/Vaincre%20avril%201990.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }} The April 1989, June 1989, September 1989, April 1990 issues of ''Vaincre'' were compiled together (with some of the articles modified) in 1992 and entitled ''Le Cercle: Rennes-le-Château et le Prieuré de Sion'', consisting of 86 pages. This material was published in December 2007 by Pierre Jarnac in ''Pégase, No 5 hors série, Le Prieuré de Sion - Les Archives de Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair – Rennes-le-Chateau – Gisors – Stenay'' (90 pages) {{cite web |url=http://www.rennes-le-chateau.tv/back/images_article/03010918115990.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051656/http://www.rennes-le-chateau.tv/back/images_article/03010918115990.jpg |archivedate=25 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Plantard: "We would like to repeat that in no case have we found any trace of the son of Dagobert II in the list of the Visigothic Razes. This Sigibert IV found refuge with his abbess sister at Oeren and was the cousin of Sigebert de Rhedae, who was alive more or less around the same time. Historians conflate these two Sigiberts into one person. When did Sigebert IV die? We don't know. Some think that he was the founder of the Habsburg family."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pelat Affair===
In September 1993, while investigative judge Thierry Jean-Pierre was investigating the activities of multi-millionaire Roger-Patrice Pelat in the context of the Pechiney-Triangle Affair, he was informed that Pelat may have once been [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of an esoteric society known as the Priory of Sion. Pelat's name had been on Plantard's list of Grand Masters since 1989. In fact, Pelat had died in 1989, while he was being indicted for [[insider trading]]. Following a long established pattern of using dead people's names, Plantard "recruited" the "initiate" Pelat soon after his death and included him as the most recent Priory of Sion Grand Master.&lt;ref name="lepoint"&gt;"Affaire Pelat: Le Rapport du Juge", ''Le Point'', no. 1112 (8–14 January 1994), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantard had first claimed that Pelat had been a Grand Master in a Priory of Sion pamphlet dated 8 March 1989, then claimed it again later in a 1990 issue of ''Vaincre'', the revived publication of Alpha Galates, a pseudo-[[chivalric order]] created by Plantard in [[Vichy France]] to support the "[[National Revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Les Cahiers de Rennes-le-Chateau'', Nr. IX, page 59, Éditions Bélisane, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Bedu, ''Les sources secrètes du Da Vinci Code'', Editions du Rocher, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelat had been a friend of [[François Mitterrand]], then [[President of France]], and at the centre of a scandal involving French Prime Minister [[Pierre Bérégovoy]]. As an investigative judge, Jean-Pierre could not dismiss any information brought to his attention pertaining to the case, especially if it might have led to a scandal similar to the one implicating an illegal [[Masonic lodge]] named [[Propaganda Due]] in the 1982 [[Banco Ambrosiano]] bank failure in Italy, Jean-Pierre ordered a search of Plantard's home. The search turned up a hoard of false documents, including some proclaiming Plantard the true [[king of France]]. Plantard admitted under oath that he had fabricated everything, including Pelat's involvement with the Priory of Sion.&lt;ref name="lepoint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philippe Laprévôte 1996 p. 140"&gt;Philippe Laprévôte, "Note sur l’actualité du Prieuré de Sion", in: ''Politica Hermetica'', Nr. 10 (1996), pp. 140–151.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantard was threatened with legal action by the Pelat family and therefore disappeared to his house in [[southern France]]. He was 74 years old at the time. Nothing more was heard of him until he died in Paris on 3 February 2000.&lt;ref name="Octonovo"&gt;Laurent "Octonovo" Buchholtzer, "Pierre Plantard, Geneviève Zaepfell and the Alpha-Galates", in: ''Actes du Colloque 2006'', Oeil-du-Sphinx, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sandri revival===
On 27 December 2002, an open letter announced the revival of the Priory of Sion as an [[Traditionalist School|integral traditionalist]] esoteric society, which stated that: "The Commanderies of Saint-Denis, Millau, Geneva and Barcelona are fully operative. According to the Tradition, the first Commanderie is under the direction of a woman", claiming there were 9,841 members.&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin ''Pégase'' N°06, Janvier/Mars 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed by Gino Sandri (who claims to be Plantard's former private secretary) under the title of General Secretary,&lt;ref name="Buccholtzer, 2008"&gt;Laurent "Octonovo" Buchholtzer, ''Rennes-le-Château, une Affaire Paradoxale'', Oeil-du-Sphinx, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and by "P. Plantard" (Le Nautonnier, G. Chyren). Sandri is a well-versed [[occultist]] who has spent his life infiltrating esoteric societies only to get expelled from them.&lt;ref name="Buccholtzer, 2008"/&gt; After interviewing Sandri, independent researcher Laurent Octonovo Buchholtzer wrote:

{{quote|I’ve personally met this Gino Sandri on one occasion, and I had the opportunity to have a really good talk with him, but I think that he's simply seeking attention. He seemed to me to be something of a mythomaniac, which would certainly be an excellent qualification for being Secretary of the Priory of Sion. During our conversation he said something in passing that I found quite extraordinary. He said, “Ultimately, what is the Priory of Sion? It's nothing more than a well-known brand name, but with goodness knows what behind it?” He gave a good brief account of the phenomenon of the Priory of Sion. Thanks to Dan Brown, hundreds of millions of people now have “brand awareness”, and several million of them seem to take it seriously.&lt;ref name="Octonovo"/&gt;}}

===''The Da Vinci Code''===

As a result of [[Dan Brown]]'s best-selling 2003 [[conspiracy fiction]] novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and the subsequent 2006 [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|film]],&lt;ref name="DVC"/&gt; there was a new level of public interest in the Priory of Sion. Brown's novel promotes the mythical version of the Priory but departs from the ultimate conclusions presented in ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''. Rather than plotting to create a Federal Europe ruled by a [[Merovingian]] [[sacred king]] descended from the [[historical Jesus]], the Priory of Sion initiates its members into a [[mystery cult]] seeking to restore the [[feminist theology]] necessary for a complete understanding of [[early Christianity]], which was supposedly suppressed by the Roman Catholic Church. The author has presented this speculation as fact in his non-fiction preface, as well as in his public appearances and interviews.

Furthermore, in their 1987 sequel ''[[The Messianic Legacy]]'',&lt;ref name="Baigent, Leigh &amp; Lincoln 1987"/&gt; Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh suggested that there was a current conflict between the Priory of Sion and the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], which they speculated might have originated from an earlier rivalry between the [[Knights Templar]] and [[Knights Hospitaller]] during the [[Crusades]]. However, for the dramatic structure of ''The Da Vinci Code'', Brown chose the [[controversies about Opus Dei|controversial]] Roman Catholic [[personal prelature|prelature]] [[Opus Dei]] as the [[The Assassini#Similarities|Assassini]]-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite the fact that no author had ever argued that there is a conflict between these two groups.

===''The Sion Revelation''===
Further conspiracy theories were reported in the 2006 non-fiction book ''The Sion Revelation: The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline'' by [[Lynn Picknett]] and Clive Prince (authors of the 1997 non-fiction book ''[[The Templar Revelation]]'', the principal source for Dan Brown's claims about hidden messages in the work of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]).&lt;ref name="Picknett &amp; Prince 2006"&gt;Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince, ''The Sion Revelation. The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline'', Touchstone, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7432-6303-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They accepted that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion was a hoax created by Plantard, and that his claim that he was a Merovingian [[dynast]] was a lie. However, they insist that this was part of a complex [[red herring (narrative)|red herring]] intended to distract the public from the hidden agenda of Plantard and his [[agent handling|"controllers"]]. They argue that the Priory of Sion was a [[front organisation]] for one of the many crypto-political societies which have been plotting to create a "[[United States of Europe]]" in line with French [[list of occultists|occultist]] [[Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]]'s [[synarchist]] vision of an ideal form of government.

===''Bloodline'' movie===
The 2008 documentary ''[[Bloodline (documentary)|Bloodline]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Bloodline'' DVD (Cinema Libre, 2008, 113 minutes). The documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1244 Films and producers Bruce Burgess, a British filmmaker with an interest in [[paranormal]] claims and Rene Barnett, a Los Angeles researcher and television and filmmaker, expands on the "[[Jesus bloodline]]" hypothesis and other elements of ''The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail''.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Fritze, ''Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions'', pp. 8–9 (Reaktion Books, 2009). {{ISBN|1-86189-430-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting as valid the testimony of an amateur archaeologist codenamed "Ben Hammott" relating to his discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; The film speculates that Ben has found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which Hammott claimed to believe is [[Mary Magdalene]], in an underground tomb purportedly connected to both the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society – Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society – Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 2012, ahead of an impending public outing on the internet, Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on NightVision Radio, a podcast hosted by Bloodline Producer Rene Barnett (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=20 March 2012 }}, entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged Grand Masters==
The mythic version of the Priory of Sion first referred to during the 1960s was supposedly led by a "Nautonnier", an [[Old French]] word for a [[navigator]], which means [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] in their internal esoteric nomenclature. The following list of Grand Masters is derived from the ''[[Dossiers Secrets|Dossiers Secrets d'Henri Lobineau]]'' compiled by Plantard under the ''nom de plume'' of "Philippe Toscan du Plantier" in 1967. All those named on this list had died before that date. All but two are also found on lists of alleged “[[Imperator]]s” (supreme heads) and “distinguished members” of the [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis]] which circulated in France at the time when Plantard was in touch with this [[Rosicrucian Order]]. Most of those named share the common thread of being known for having an interest in the [[occult]] or [[Christian heresy|heresy]].&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2005"/&gt;
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|right|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], alleged to be the Priory of Sion's 12th Grand Master]]

The ''Dossiers Secrets'' asserted that the Priory of Sion and the [[Knights Templar]] always shared [[Grand Masters of the Knights Templar|the same Grand Master]] until a [[schism (religion)|schism]] occurred during the "[[Cutting of the elm]]" incident in 1188. Following that event, the Grand Masters of the Priory of Sion are listed in [[French language|French]] as being:
# [[Jean de Gisors]] (1188–1220)
# Marie de Saint-Clair (1220–1266)
# [[Guillaume de Gisors]] (1266–1307)
# [[Edouard de Bar]] (1307–1336)
# [[Jeanne de Bar]] (1336–1351)
# Jean de Saint-Clair (1351–1366)
# [[Blanche of Navarre, Queen of France|Blanche d'Évreux]] (1366–1398)
# [[Nicolas Flamel]] (1398–1418)
# [[René of Anjou|René d'Anjou]] (1418–1480)
# [[Yolande, Duchess of Lorraine|Iolande de Bar]] (1480–1483)
# [[Sandro Botticelli]] (1483–1510)
# [[Leonardo da vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]] (1510–1519)
# [[Charles III, Duke of Bourbon|Connétable de Bourbon]] (1519–1527)
# [[Ferrante Gonzaga|Ferrante I Gonzaga]] (1527–1575)
# [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers|Ludovico Gonzaga]] (1575–1595)
# [[Robert Fludd]] (1595–1637)
# [[Johannes Valentinus Andreae|J. Valentin Andrea]] (1637–1654)
# [[Robert Boyle]] (1654–1691)
# [[Isaac Newton]] (1691–1727)
# [[Charles Radclyffe]] (1727–1746)
# [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles de Lorraine]] (1746–1780)
# [[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria|Maximilian de Lorraine]] (1780–1801)
# [[Charles Nodier]] (1801–1844)
# [[Victor Hugo]] (1844–1885)
# [[Claude Debussy]] (1885–1918)
# [[Jean Cocteau]] (1918–1963)

A later document, ''Le Cercle d'Ulysse'',&lt;ref name="Jean Delaude 1994"/&gt; identifies [[François Ducaud-Bourget]], a prominent [[Traditionalist Catholic]] priest who Plantard had worked for as a [[Sexton (office)|sexton]] during World War II,&lt;ref name="Introvigne 2005" /&gt;  as the Grand Master following Cocteau's death. Plantard himself is later identified as the next Grand Master.

When the ''Dossiers Secrets'' were exposed as a forgery by French researchers, Plantard kept quiet. During his 1989 attempt to make a comeback and revive the Priory of Sion, Plantard sought to distance himself from the discredited first list, and published a second list of Priory Grand Masters,&lt;ref&gt;The second list appeared in ''Vaincre'' No. 3, September 1989, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; which included the names of the deceased Roger-Patrice Pelat, and his own son Thomas Plantard de Saint-Clair:
# Jean-Tim Negri d'Albes (1681–1703)
# François d'Hautpoul (1703–1726)
# [[André-Hercule de Fleury]] (1726–1766)
# [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles de Lorraine]] (1766–1780)
# [[Archduke Maximilian Franz of Austria|Maximilian de Lorraine]] (1780–1801)
# [[Charles Nodier]] (1801–1844)
# [[Victor Hugo]] (1844–1885)
# [[Claude Debussy]] (1885–1918)
# [[Jean Cocteau]] (1918–1963)
# François Balphangon (1963–1969)
# John Drick (1969–1981)
# [[Pierre Plantard|Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair]] (1981)
# [[Philippe de Chérisey]] (1984–1985)
# Roger-Patrice Pelat (1985–1989)
# [[Pierre Plantard|Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair]] (1989)
# Thomas Plantard de Saint-Clair (1989)

In 1993 Plantard acknowledged that both lists were fraudulent when he was investigated by a judge during the [[Priory of Sion#Pelat Affair|Pelat Affair]].&lt;ref name="lepoint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philippe Laprévôte 1996 p. 140"/&gt;

In 2006, American author Eric Mader-Lin made a public declaration claiming to be the current Grand Master of the Priory of Sion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.necessaryprose.com/thegm.htm|title=Declaration from the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion|author=|date=|website=www.necessaryprose.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1346">The '''Pysa''' was a [[Zanzibar]]i coin that was struck in AH1299 (1882) and AH1304 (1887). The obverses of these coins have a pair of [[Weighing scale|scales]]. The name 'Pysa' is derived from the currency units '[[Pice]]' and '[[Paisa]]'. The AH1299 1 Pysa often turns up in old [[coin]] collections, but the AH1304 coin very seldom turns up. The AH1299 coin was struck at the [[Royal Belgian Mint]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] while the AH1304 coin was struck at [[Heaton's Mint]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

These coins were commissioned by Sultan [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]] ibn Sultan who was, apparently and understandably, upset that his name was written incorrectly on the coins as "Sultan Said ibn Barghash ibn Sultan". It is accompanied by the expression "حفظه الله", "may Allah save him". Note that even one of the Arabic characters was incorrectly written: the "fa" in "حفظه" is written with a dot below (a Maghreb variant) rather than with the dot above as in standard Arabic script.

'''Robert Heron''' (6 November 1764 – 13 April 1807) was a Scottish writer.

==Life==
Robert Heron was son of John Heron, a [[Weaver (occupation)|weaver]], and was born in [[New Galloway]], [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], on 6 November 1764. He was taught privately by his mother until his ninth year, when he was sent to the parish school, where he displayed such precocity that at the age of eleven he was employed to teach some of the local farmers' children and at fourteen was appointed master of the parochial school of Kelton. {{sfn|Henderson|1891}}

By the end of 1780, he had saved sufficient money to enable him, with the help of his parents, to enter the [[University of Edinburgh]] with the view of studying for the church. He supported his studies partly by teaching but chiefly by miscellaneous work for booksellers. In autumn 1789, while a divinity student, he visited [[Robert Burns]], who entrusted him with a letter to a Dr. Blacklock, which he failed to deliver. In a rhyming epistle to Blacklock, Burns attributes Heron's faithlessness either to preoccupation with ‘some dainty fair one,’ or to partiality for liquor.{{sfn|Henderson|1891}}
 
Heron was for some time assistant to a Dr. Blair, but, according to his own statement, all his ‘ideas, as well of exertion as of enjoyment, soon became literary.’ His first independent literary venture was a small edition in 1789 of Thomson's ''Seasons'', with a criticism on his poetry; a larger edition appeared in 1793. In 1790–1, he announced a course of lectures on the ''Law of Nature, the Law of Nations, the Jewish, the Grecian, the Roman and the Canon Law, and then on the Feudal Law,'' intended as an introduction to the study of law, but the scheme was unsuccessful. {{sfn|Henderson|1891}}

His imprudent habits overwhelmed him with debt, and he was thrown into prison by his creditors. On their suggestion, he undertook a ''[[History of Scotland (book)|History of Scotland]]'' for Messrs. Morrison of Perth, who engaged to pay him three guineas per sheet. After making some progress he was liberated from prison on condition of devoting two-thirds of his remuneration to paying 15''s''. in the pound. The first volume (1794), was nearly all written in gaol. In his preface, he expressed a hope that this would be regarded as some excuse for ‘considerable imperfections.’ The excuse is naive but all Heron's works bear evident marks of superficial knowledge and hurried composition. The ''History'' was completed in six volumes, 1794–9. {{sfn|Henderson|1891}}

In 1798, at the [[Theatre Royal, Edinburgh]], Heron produced a comedy which was condemned before the second act. Attributing its failure to a conspiracy against him, he published it under the title ''St. Kilda in Edinburgh, or News from Camperdown, a Comic Drama in Two Acts, with a Critical Preface, to which is added an Account of a famous Ass Race'' (1798); the publication attracted no attention. Returning to [[New Galloway (Parliament of Scotland constituency)|New Galloway]] as a [[ruling elder]], Heron served several years in the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and frequently spoke with fluency and ability. {{sfn|Henderson|1891}}

In order to obtain more constant literary occupation, he removed in 1799 to London, where he contributed largely to the periodicals, editing the ''Globe,'' the ''British Press,'' and other newspapers, and acting as a parliamentary reporter. In 1806 he commenced a newspaper entitled ''The Fame,'' which proved unsuccessful. Its failure and Heron's improvident habits led to his confinement by his creditors in [[Newgate prison]], where, according to his own statement, he was reduced ‘to the very extremity of bodily and pecuniary distress.’ On 2 February 1807, from Newgate, he wrote a letter to the [[Royal Literary Fund]], recounting his services to literature, and appealing for aid, but the appeal met with no response. Being attacked by fever, Heron was removed to [[St Pancras Hospital]], where he died 13 April 1807. {{sfn|Henderson|1891}}

==Works==
Besides the works above mentioned, Heron also published: 
# A translation of Niebuhr's ''Travels through Arabia,'' 1792. 
# ''Elegant Extracts of Natural History,'' 1792. 
# ''Arabian Tales, or continuations of Arabian Nights' Entertainments,'' translated from the French, 4 vols. 1792. 
# ''Observations made in a Journey through the Western Counties of Scotland in 1792,'' 2 vols., Perth, 1792; 2nd ed. 1799. 
# ''General View of the Natural Circumstances of the Hebrides,'' 1794. 
# ''Letters which passed between General Dumourier and Pache, Minister of War to the French Republic in 1792,'' translated from the French, 1794. 
# ''Information concerning the Strength, Views, and Interests of the Powers presently at War,'' 1794. 
# A translation of Fourcroy's ''Chemistry,'' 1796. 
# ''An Account of the Life of Muley Liezet, late Emperor of Morocco,'' translated from the French, 1797. 
# ''Letter to Sir John Sinclair, bart., on the necessity of an instant Change of Ministry'', published under the name of Ralph Anderson, 1797. 
# ''Scotland Described,'' Edinburgh, 1797, 12mo. 
# ''Life of Robert Burns,'' Edinburgh, 1797 (a work of some value, owing to the writer's knowledge of the south-west of Scotland). 
# ''A New and Complete System of Universal Geography, to which is added a Philosophical View of Universal History,'' 4 vols. 1798. 
# ''Elements of Chemistry,'' London, 1800. 
# ''Letter to William Wilberforce, esq., M.P., on the Justice and Expediency of the Slave Trade, and on the best means to improve the Manners and Condition of the Negroes in the West Indies,'' 1806. An edition of the ''Letters of Junius'', 1802, in Watt's ''Bibl. Brit.'' is credited to Pinkerton, but a letter in ''Notes and Queries'', 1st ser. vi. 445, clearly shows that Heron and not Pinkerton was the editor. Pinkerton was, however, the author of ''Letters of Literature'', published under the pseudonym of ‘Robert Heron’ in 1784. {{sfn|Henderson|1891}}

A manuscript ''Journal of My Conduct'', by Heron, is in the library of the University of Edinburgh (Laing collection). Heron also contributed to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]],'' the ''[[London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine|Edinburgh Magazine]],'' and other periodicals; and was employed by Sir [[Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet|John Sinclair]] in the preparation of the ''Statistical Account of Scotland.''

'''Sir Archibald Alison, 1st Baronet''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|FRSE}} (29 December 1792{{snd}}23 May 1867) was a Scottish [[advocate]] (attorney) and [[historian]]. He held several prominent legal appointments. He was the younger son of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] cleric and author [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]]. His elder brother was the physician and social reformer [[William Alison]].

==Background==
He was born at the [[parsonage]] at [[Kenley, Shropshire]], to the Rev. [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]] and his wife Dorothea Gregory, daughter of [[John Gregory (moralist)|John Gregory]], and granddaughter of [[James Forbes, 17th Lord Forbes]].&lt;ref name = Dod&gt;{{cite book | last = Dod | first = Robert P. | title = The Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland | year = 1860 | publisher = Whitaker and Co. | location = London | pages = 88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800 his parents moved the family back to Edinburgh, as his father thought that he could give his sons a better education and more independent careers in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen, Leslie (1885). [https://archive.org/stream/dictionarynatio43stepgoog#page/n300/mode/2up "Alison, Sir Archibald (1792–1867)."] In: ''Dictionary of National Biography,'' Vol. 1. New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., p. 286–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying under a private tutor, and at the [[University of Edinburgh]], he was, in 1814, admitted to the [[Faculty of Advocates]], at which he ultimately attained some distinction, becoming in 1834 [[Sheriff of Lanarkshire]]. In 1853, he received a [[Doctor of Civil Law|Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law]] by the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref name = Dod/&gt;

The [[University College London]], Legacies of British Slave-ownership, two projects based at UCL tracing the impact of slave-ownership on the formation of modern Britain:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/project/details/&lt;/ref&gt; (the ESRC-funded Legacies of British Slave-ownership project, now complete, and the ESRC and AHRC-funded Structure and significance of British Caribbean slave-ownership 1763-1833, running from 2013-2015), highlight that, '''Sir Archibald Alison 1st Bart.''', benefited from the compensation paid out following the abolition of slavery in 1833. According to the record, he benefited from a payment of £4,081,18s,10d, an approximate £346,000 in 2015, made by the government of United Kingdom and Great Britain as recorded by the Slave Compensation Commission and the records held at the National Archives in London. The record containing the facts discovered can be found at the UCL's ''Legacies of British Slave-ownership'' database,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/46692&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/8659&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Archive and the records of the Slave Compensation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/search/search_results.aspx?Page=1&amp;QueryText=slave+compensation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
When travelling in France in 1814 he conceived the idea of his expansive ''History of Europe from the commencement of the French revolution to the restoration of the Bourbons''. This multi-volume set is usually regarded as Alison's chief historical work and is considered to be the first scholarly English-language study of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Blackwell&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Historians |last=Derry |first=John |editor=[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] |year=1988 |publisher=Basil Blackwell Ltd. |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=063114708X |page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in ten volumes between 1833 and 1843, ''History of Europe'' was revised and reprinted many times throughout the century,&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt; including numerous foreign language editions.&lt;ref&gt;"It was by far the best-selling history of the French Revolution in England and America almost to the end of the century, and was translated into most European and several oriental languages." — Ben Israel, Hedva (1968). ''English Historians of the French Revolution.'' London: Cambridge University Press, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is one of vast industry, "contain[ing] a wealth of information communicated in a vigorous though wordy style."&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt;

[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Disraeli]] satirises the author in ''[[Coningsby (novel)|Coningsby]]'' as Mr. Wordy, who wrote a history to prove that Providence was on the side of the Tories.&lt;ref&gt;Disraeli, Benjamin (1844). [https://archive.org/stream/02717595.5129.emory.edu/02717595_5129#page/n5/mode/2up ''Conningsby,''] Vol. 1. London: Henry Coulburn, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticism notwithstanding, ''History of Europe'' proved to be a huge commercial success.&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt; By 1848 100,000 copies had been sold in the United States. It was translated into French, German, and even Arabic, in which language 2,000 copies were published "under the auspices of the Pasha of Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen (1885), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; Alison also composed a comprehensive survey of the military campaigns of the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]], as well as two standard works on the [[criminal law of Scotland]].

He was elected [[Lord Rector]] successively of [[Marischal College]], [[Aberdeen]], and of the [[University of Glasgow]]. On 25 June 1852 he was created a [[baronet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=21327 |date=11 June 1852 |page=1648}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]]'s administration.

==Family and death==
In 1825, he married Elizabeth Glencairn (1799 - 1874), the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Duff Tytler (1760 - 1849); the children from the marriage were Archibald, Frederick and Ella Frances Catherine who married [[James Charlemagne Dormer]]. Both sons became distinguished British officers. The 1st Baronet's autobiography was published in 1883;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Some Account of my Life and Writings: an Autobiography'' by the late Sir Archibald Alison, Bart., ed. by his Daughter-in-law, Lady Alison|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1883|volume=155|pages=35–74|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924065563904;view=1up;seq=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; his portrait was painted by [[Robert Scott Lauder]].

Alison died at [[Possil House]], [[Glasgow]], at the age of 74, and was interred in [[Dean Cemetery]], [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/mlemen/mlemen001.htm |title=Sir Archibald Alison, 1792–1867 |author=MacLehose, James |year=1886 |origyear=2012 |publisher=[[University of Strathclyde]] |work=Glasgow Digital Library |accessdate=19 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed great popularity in Glasgow. His funeral was attended by a crowd of from 100,000 to 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen (1885), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; His grave lies amid the "Lord's Row" against the western wall, and is modest in comparison to most in this section.

He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his elder son, [[Sir Archibald Alison, 2nd Baronet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3561">'''Skënder Rizaj''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Скендер Ризај, ''Skender Rizaj'') (born 1930 in [[Pejë|Peja]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]) is an [[Albanians|Albanian]] scholar and historian.&lt;ref name="Elsie2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=Historical Dictionary of Kosova|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fnbw1wsacSAC&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=4 August 2012|year=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810853096|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specialises in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman period]] of Balkans history.

==Career==
Rizaj earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in History from [[Skopje]] University in 1956 and his [[doctorate]] from [[Sarajevo]] University in 1965. He is one of the founders of the Department of History of the [[University of Pristina (1969-1999)|University of Pristina]], where he taught from 1965 until he retired in 1987. He also worked as a Special Consultant for Turkish State Archives in [[Istanbul]] from 1989 to 1990. Rizaj is still active in writing and in 2010 was awarded as "Educator Emeritus" by the [[Republic of Kosovo|Kosovan]] government.

==Fields of interest==
He has done extensive research in Turkish Archives in [[Istanbul]], and the [[British Library]] in [[London]]. During his studies, he mastered [[Serbian language]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], as well as modern [[Turkish language]] and English. He has written extensively on Albanian history, with an emphasis on [[Kosovo]]. His research gave him enough scientific material to produce several books, most prominent his 1982 book "[[Kosovo]] during the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries" in which he emphasizes that [[Kosovo]] was dominated by ethnic [[Albanians]] during and after the [[Middle Ages]], a claim refuted by modern historiography.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

He also wrote a university textbook " History of the New Era (1453-1789)", published in 1985.

'''Tempore''' (abbreviated to '''temp.'''), in historical literature, denotes a period during which a person whose exact lifespan is unknown was known to have been alive or active, or some other date which is not exactly known, usually given as the reign of a monarch. The word is [[Latin]], being the [[Ablative case|ablative]] singular of the noun ''tempus, temporis'', "time", thus meaning "in the time (of)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BIxyWH0FKgYC&amp;pg=PT586&amp;dq=Tempore+temp.+latin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj9gJ_KutfXAhXDCBoKHVZLC3AQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Tempore%20temp.%20latin&amp;f=false|title=Soma's Dictionary of Latin Quotations, Maxims and Phrases: A Compendium of Latin Thought and Rhetorical Instruments for the Speaker, Author and Legal|last=S.O.M.A|date=2010|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781425144975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be followed by a name in the [[genitive case]]. The theoretical full form might be ''vixit tempore Regis Henrici Primi'' ("he/she lived in the time of King Henry the First") (i.e. 1100-1135).

The best known occurrence is in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, where the phrase ''Tempore Regis Eduardi'' (nominative case ''Rex Eduardus''), meaning "in the time of [[Edward the Confessor|King Edward (the Confessor)]]" appears in the entry for almost every [[manor]], abbreviated as TRE. It thus signifies the date range 1042–1066. It is useful in historical literature because the names of many historical persons appear in surviving documents only in royal charters, possibly as witnesses, which can be dated to the reign of the originating monarch.

The word ''tempore'' is often given in its abbreviated form ''temp.'' It is similar to ''[[floruit]]'' ("flourished" [at a date or range of dates]) which however is more appropriate for artists to denote not merely a period of life, but a particularly productive period within that lifespan.

From 1985 to 1989 he was a researcher for [[NAVF]], and from 1990 he worked at the [[Norwegian Institute for Social Research]]. He is now a professor in the Department of Political Science, [[University of Oslo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statsvitenskap.uio.no/ansatte/presentasjon/person/trnordby-eng.xml|title=Trond Nordby - Professor|date=16 June 2006|publisher=Department of Political Science, University of Oslo|accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been promoted in 1995.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Trond Nordby|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Trond_Nordby|language=Norwegian|accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old College, University of Edinburgh courtyard facade detail.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Henry Playfair]], [[University of Edinburgh]]: beveled edges of each stone block emphasise the voussoirs.]]
A '''voussoir''' {{IPAc-en|v|u|ˈ|s|w|ɑr}} is a wedge-shaped element, typically a stone, which is used in building an [[arch]] or [[vault (architecture)|vault]].&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane Vadnal|url=https://Pitt.edu/~medart/menuglossary/voussoir.htm|title=Glossary of Medieval Art and Architecture - voussoir|date=August 1997|website=Pitt.edu|publisher=[[University of Pittsburgh]]|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although each unit in an arch or vault is a voussoir, two units are of distinct functional importance: the [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] and the [[Springer (architecture)|springer]].  The keystone is the centre stone or masonry unit at the apex of an arch.  The springer is the lowest voussoir on each side, located where the curve of the arch springs from the vertical support or [[abutment]] of the wall or [[pier (architecture)|pier]].&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt;

The keystone is often decorated or enlarged.  An enlarged and sometimes slightly dropped keystone is often found in [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] arches of the 16th century, beginning with the works of [[Giulio Romano]], who also began the fashion for using voussoirs above rectangular openings, rather than a [[lintel]] (Palazzo Stati Maccarani, Rome, circa 1522).

The word is a [[Stonemasonry|mason's]] term borrowed in [[Middle English]] from French verbs connoting a 'turn' (''[[OED]]'').  Each wedge-shaped voussoir ''turns aside'' the thrust of the mass above, transferring it from stone to stone to the springer's bottom face ('impost'), which is horizontal and passes the thrust on to the supports.  Voussoir arches distribute weight efficiently, and take maximum advantage of the [[compressive strength]] of stone, as in an [[arch bridge]].

In [[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic]] and [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] architectural traditions, the voussoirs are often in alternating colours, usually red and white. This is sometimes found in [[Romanesque architecture]] also.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, British bricklayers became aware that, by thickening the vertical mortar joint between regularly shaped bricks from bottom to top, they could construct an elliptical arch of useful strength{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} over either a standard 'former', or over specially constructed timber [[falsework]] (temporary structure to be removed once the construction is complete).  The bricks used in such an arch are often referred to as 'voussoirs'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2630">'''William Wynne''' ([[circa|c.]] 1671 &amp;ndash; May 1704) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] historian.

==Life==
Wynne was the youngest son of Robert Wynne (a [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Bangor Cathedral]] and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Llanddeiniolen]] and [[Llaniestyn, Gwynedd|Llaniestyn]]) and his wife Catherine Madryn, heiress of [[Llannerch Fawr]].  William Wynne's eldest brother was [[Robert Wynne (Chancellor of St Asaph)|Robert Wynne]].  William Wynne was born before 12 November 1671 and educated at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] (like his father and elder brother).&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Foster (genealogist)|title=Alumni Oxonienses: The Members of the University of Oxford, 1500&amp;ndash;1714|isbn=978-1-85506-843-8 |year=1891/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He [[matriculation|matriculated]] in March 1688 and took his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1691.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-WYNN-WIL-1671.html | title=Wynne, William (1671?&amp;ndash;1704), historian | work=Welsh Biography Online | publisher=[[National Library of Wales]] | last=Jenkins | first=Robert Thomas | accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|Fellow]] of the college in 1692, and held this position until his death in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Ernest George|authorlink=Ernest George Hardy|title=Jesus College|publisher=F.

Whilst at Oxford, he was part of the circle of [[Edward Lhuyd]], the Welsh naturalist, botanist, linguist, geographer and antiquary. Wynne's publications included a ''History of Wales'' (1697), which was essentially a new version of [[David Powel]]'s 1584 work ''[[Cronica Walliae|The Historie of Cambria, now called Wales]]''.  Wynne's version, which was reprinted in 1702 (unchanged), 1774 and 1812 (with changes each time), and in 1832 (with [[topographical]] notes), was the starting point in English on medieval [[Welsh history]] for nearly two hundred years.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

'''`Alí-Akbar Furútan''' (29 April 1905 &amp;ndash; 26 November 2003) was a prominent [[Iran]]ian [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] educator and author who was given the rank of [[Hand of the Cause]] in 1951.

A native of [[Sabzevar|Sabzivár]] in what was, at the time, [[Iran]]'s [[province of Khorasan|Khurásán]], `Alí-Akbar Furútan was still a child when he witnessed the persecution of his family and others for their beliefs. Seeking safety, the family moved in 1914 from Sabzivár to [[Ashkhabad]] in [[Russian Turkestan|Turkestan]], which was then a part of the [[Russian Empire]]. In 1926, nine years after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], 21-year-old Furútan won a scholarship to the [[University of Moscow]], where he studied education and child psychology.&lt;ref name="academy"/&gt; Within four years, as a result of his Bahá'í activities, he was expelled from the [[Soviet Union]] and, in 1930, returned to Iran.

After he returned to Iran, he and his wife helped administer the ''Tarbiyat School for Boys'',&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news | title = High-ranking member of the Baha'i Faith passes away | date= 2003-11-26 | publisher = Bahá’í International Community | url = http://news.bahai.org/story/261}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later closed by the Pahlavi government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denial.bahai.org/003.php ''History of Bahá'í Educational Efforts in Iran''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, `Alí-Akbar Furútan was elected to the National [[Spiritual Assembly]] of Iran in 1934, serving as its secretary until 1957. In December 1951, he was appointed a [[Hands of the Cause|Hand of the Cause of God]] by [[Shoghi Effendi]].&lt;ref name="academy"&gt;{{cite book | title = Lights of Fortitude | accessdate=2011-06-01 | last = Harper | first = Barron | pages = 211–22 | url = http://www.furutanacademy.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1959 to 1963, he served as one of the nine [[Shoghi Effendi#Ministry of the Custodians|Custodians]] at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="academy"/&gt;

Throughout his life, `Alí-Akbar Furútan taught Bahá'í classes for children and youth, and he published many works in the area of child spiritual and material education.&lt;ref name="academy"/&gt;

`Ali-Akbar Furútan died in Haifa five months before his 99th birthday.&lt;ref name="news"/&gt;
