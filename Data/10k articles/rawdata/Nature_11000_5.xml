'''{{mp|2001 AV|43}}''' is a very small, monolithic [[asteroid]] and [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter. It was first observed on 5 January 2001, by astronomers of the [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|LINEAR]] program at [[Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site]] near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The presumed [[S-type asteroid]] has an [[rotation period]] of only 10 minutes.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; It has an exceptionally low [[minimum orbital intersection distance|MOID]] of 0.66 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] (LD) and will approach Earth at 0.81&amp;nbsp;LD on 11 November 2029.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2001 AV|43}} is a member of the dynamical [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]],&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; which are [[Earth-crossing asteroid]]s. Apollo asteroids are the largest subgroup of [[near-Earth object]]s. Unlike many Apollo asteroids, this asteroid is not a [[Mars-crosser]], as its [[aphelion]] is smaller than the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

This asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.97–1.59&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 17 months (531 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.28&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.24 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 0[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with a [[precovery]] found in [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]]'s [[Astrovirtel]] data archive {{Obscode|I03}}, in August 2000, less than 5 months prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close approaches ===

{{mp|2001 AV|43}} has an ''Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]]'' of {{convert |0.0017 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off |sigfig=3}}, which translates into 0.7 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] (LD). Due to its small size, that is, an [[absolute magnitude]] fainter than 22, this asteroid is not classified as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

On 18 November 2013, the asteroid passed Earth at 2.7&amp;nbsp;LD. The angle of approach made it a good target for radar observations.&lt;ref name="staradvertiser.com" /&gt;

On 11 November 2029, the orbit of {{mp|2001 AV|43}} is predicted to bring the asteroid within a nominal distance of {{convert |0.00209 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off}} or 0.81&amp;nbsp;LD of Earth. It will also pass the [[Moon]] at an even shorter nominal distance of {{convert |0.00166 |AU |km mi |abbr=on |lk=off}}&lt;ref name="jpldata"/&gt;

==Physical characteristics==

{{mp|2001 AV|43}} is an assumed stony [[S-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

A rotational [[lightcurve]] of {{mp|2001 AV|43}} was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomers [[Robert J. Whiteley]], [[Carl Hergenrother]] and [[David Tholen]]. Lightcurve analysis gave a [[rotation period]] of 0.1701 hours (612 second) with a brightness amplitude of 0.26 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2]]}}).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Whiteley-2002" /&gt; With such a short period, it is a notable [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]]. The observers classified it as a "monolithic fast-rotating asteroid" (MFRA).&lt;ref name="Whiteley-2002" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 0.03 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 24.9.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Numbering and naming ==

As of 2018, this [[minor planet]] has neither been numbered nor [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''Daniel Hernandez''' (born May 8, 1996), known professionally as '''6ix9ine''' (pronounced "six nine") or '''Tekashi69''', is an American rapper and Internet personality. Hernandez is known for his distinctive [[rainbow]]-themed look, [[Hardcore hip hop|aggressive]] style of rapping, public feuds with fellow celebrities, legal issues, and controversial public persona. All 10 of his singles have charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/6ix9ine-celebrates-stoopid-going-10-for-10-on-billboard-while-heading-to-court-news.62336.html|title=6ix9ine Celebrates "Stoopid" Going 10 For 10 On Billboard While Heading To Court|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernandez rose to mainstream fame in late 2017 with the release of his debut single "[[Gummo (song)|Gummo]]", which was certified [[Music certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. In early 2018, Hernandez released his debut mixtape, ''[[Day69]]'', which debuted at number 4 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart. He later earned his first top-five entry on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 with "[[Fefe (song)|Fefe]]", featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Murda Beatz]], which peaked at number three on the chart. His debut studio album, ''[[Dummy Boy]]'', was released on November 27, 2018, after being delayed a week earlier due to his arrest.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/stream-tekashi-6ix9ines-new-album-dummy-boy-news.65484.html|title=Stream Tekashi 6ix9ine's New Album "DUMMY BOY"|work=HotNewHipHop|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernandez pled guilty to using a 13-year-old child in a sexual performance in 2015. He was [[Trial of 6ix9ine|arrested in November 2018]] on [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] and firearm charges, among others, for which he is facing a possible [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2018/11/19/tekashi-6ix9ine-arrested-on-racketeering-weapons-charges/#6316e22466a8|title=Rapper 6ix9ine jailed on racketeering and weapon charges|date=November 23, 2018|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Daniel Hernandez was born on May 8, 1996 in [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]] to a mother originally from [[Atlixco]], [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]] and a [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tidal.com/browse/track/84096476|title=Fat Joe and 6ix9ine interview presented by CocaVision and Tidal|publisher=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was raised with his older brother by his parents until he was 13, when his father was shot dead steps away from the family home.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMt46dmSuxY "Open Space: Tekashi69 - YouTube"].  Interview with Mass Appeal, published August 3, 2017. See minute 4:09.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotionally disturbed by the passing of his father, Hernandez started to act out and was eventually expelled from school in the 8th grade for bad behavior.&lt;ref name="No Jumper"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIfXo2SbruU "The 6IX9INE Interview - YouTube"]. Interview with No Jumper, published July 24, 2017. See minutes 20:34–22:32.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than continue his education, he started working various odd jobs such as working as a busboy to help his mother financially. Hernandez also dealt drugs to supplement his income, most notably selling [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and [[heroin]] on the streets while working at a local Brooklyn [[convenience store|bodega]]. He was eventually arrested for his criminal activities and sentenced to prison time at [[Rikers Island]], where he began to associate himself with the [[Nine Trey Gangsters]], a prison subset of the [[Bloods]] street gang. Hernandez began his career as a rapper in 2014, releasing songs such as "69" and "Scumlife". Other early songs were taken down by [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="No Jumper" /&gt;

== Music career ==
===2014–2016: Early career===
Hernandez began releasing rap songs in 2014. Over the next three years, he released multiple tracks and videos with titles such as "Scumlife", "Yokai", and "Hellsing Station", drawing attention for his aggressive rapping style and use of [[anime]] as music video visuals. Many of his early songs were released by FCK THEM, a music label based in [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="69early"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/how-fast-can-6ix9ine-paint-himself-into-a-corner.html|title=How Fast Can 6ix9ine Paint Himself Into a Corner?|website=Vulture|author=Frank Guan|date=February 23, 2018|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gathering fame as an internet meme for his rainbow-dyed hair and rainbow-plated [[Grill (jewelry)|grills]], he eventually became an associate of fellow New York rapper [[ZillaKami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theringer.com/2018/3/1/17067584/6ix9ine-tekashi-gummo-rap-controversy|title=Meet 6ix9ine: The First Rap Star of 2018 Is Easy to Hate, Impossible to Ignore|work=The Ringer|access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later feuded after Hernandez allegedly stole instrumentals and songs they had made together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=No Jumper|title=The ZillaKami &amp; SosMula Interview|date=July 8, 2018|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3LPT06_0Is&amp;t=914s|access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Poles1469", released in April 2017, featured Hernandez alongside [[Ohio]]-based artist [[Trippie Redd]] and was the first of Hernandez's songs to receive significant views on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="69early" /&gt;

===2017–present: Breakthrough and ''Day69''===
Hernandez rose to prominence on social media due to a July 2017 [[Instagram]] post that went viral on both Reddit and Twitter. Hernandez's eccentric appearance (rainbow-dyed hair, a rainbow [[Grill (jewelry)|grill]], and multiple versions of the number 69 tattooed on his body) turned him into an [[internet meme]].&lt;ref name="Genius"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/a/here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-controversial-brooklyn-rapper-6ix9ine-his-breakout-hit-gummo|title=Here’s What You Need To Know About Controversial Brooklyn Rapper 6ix9ine &amp; His Breakout Hit 'Gummo'|date=November 15, 2017|website=Genius|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228214844/https://genius.com/a/here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-controversial-brooklyn-rapper-6ix9ine-his-breakout-hit-gummo|archivedate=December 28, 2017|deadurl=no|access-date=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernandez's commercial debut single "[[Gummo (song)|Gummo]]" was released on November 10, 2017, and eventually peaked at number 12 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/gummo-mw0003125113 |title=GUMMO - 6ix9ine {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic |accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2017-12-30 "Billboard Hot 100: December 30, 2017"].

Hernandez stirred up controversy in May 2018 when he was involved in a shooting with the entourage of fellow New York rapper [[Casanova (rapper)|Casanova]] as part of a feud; this led to Hernandez losing a $5 million headphone deal and being banned from the [[Barclays Center]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.46742/title.alleged-tekashi-6ix9ine-affiliate-arrested-over-barclays-shooting#|title=Alleged Tekashi 6ix9ine Affiliate Arrested Over Barclays Shooting|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX -|work=HipHopDX|access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the shooting, Hernandez stopped releasing music for several months, before releasing "[[Tati (song)|Tati]]", featuring DJ Spinking in June, which debuted at number 43 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

In July 2018, Hernandez released his eighth single, "[[Fefe (song)|Fefe]]", featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Murda Beatz]]; the single debuted at number four on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 before peaking at number three in its second week, marking 6ix9ine's highest entry on the chart and his first single to reach the top five of the Hot 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8468763/drake-in-my-feelings-hot-100|title=Drake Dominates Hot 100 for Fourth Week With 'In My Feelings,' DJ Khaled's All-Star 'No Brainer' Debuts at No. 5|work=Billboard|access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fefe" was later certified double [[Music recording certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/08/6ix9ine-fefe-platinum-nicki-minaj-murda-beatz/|title=6ix9ine’s “Fefe” Featuring Nicki Minaj, Murda Beatz Goes Platinum - XXL|work=XXL Mag|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent singles, "Bebe" and "Stoopid", also proved successful and both reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Notable feuds ==

Their feud continued to escalate with mutual Internet trolling. Hernandez later accused Redd over Instagram Live of having pedophilic sexual relations with fellow rapper [[Danielle Bregoli|Danielle "Bhad Bhabie" Bregoli]], who was a minor at the time. Trippie Redd denied the allegations, and reiterated Hernandez's conviction for use of a child in sexual performance.

She questioned him after finding provocative text messages from Jade, a woman Hernandez was seeing. The incident left Molina with a bruised lip.&lt;ref&gt; [http://hyperap.com/6ix9ine-accused-of-beating-his-baby-mama-sara/ 6ix9ine Domestic Abuse Allegations Uncovered by DomIsLive News] - HypeRap Reporting&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [https://mtonews.com/.amp/rapper-tekashi-6ix9ine-accused-of-beating-baby-mama-pics 6ix9ine Allegedly a Domestic Abuser] - MTO Reporting&lt;/ref&gt;

Hernandez's criminal behavior has been the subject of controversy, most notably relating to a child sex case from 2015.&lt;ref name="Caramanica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Legal1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jezebel.com/details-in-child-sex-complaint-against-rapper-6ix9ine-c-1821245294|title=Details in Child Sex Complaint Against Rapper 6ix9ine Contradict His Public Comments|author=Rich Juzwiak|date=December 14, 2017|website=Jezebel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405180207/https://jezebel.com/details-in-child-sex-complaint-against-rapper-6ix9ine-c-1821245294|archivedate=April 5, 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Hernandez pled guilty to a felony count of use of a child in a sexual performance. He was charged with three counts of the offense after a February 2015 incident in which he had physical contact with a 13-year-old girl and later distributed videos of the incident online as part of a music video. Three videos are described in the criminal complaint against Hernandez. In the first, "the child engages in oral sexual intercourse with the separately charged defendant Taquan Anderson, while the defendant, Daniel Hernandez, stands behind the child making a thrusting motion with his pelvis and smacking her on her buttocks. The child is nude in the video." The other videos show the child sitting on Hernandez's lap while Anderson gropes her breasts, and later sitting naked across the laps of Anderson and Hernandez.&lt;ref name="Legal1" /&gt;

In a November 2017 interview, Hernandez claimed to have had "no sexual contact" with the girl and denied knowing she was a minor. Hernandez also claimed to have been 17 at the time of the incident, though the birth date listed in the complaint against him and in his statement to the police shows he was 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/12/tekashi-6ix9ine-child-sex-complaint-details/ |title=New Details in Tekashi 6ix9ine's Sexual Misconduct Case |author=Nick Mojica |date=December 14, 2017 |website=XXL |accessdate=December 29, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214025643/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/12/tekashi-6ix9ine-child-sex-complaint-details/ |archivedate=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his plea deal, Hernandez must obtain his [[General Education Development|GED]], refrain from posting sexually explicit or violent images of women or children to social media, and not commit another crime for two years, among other injunctions. If met, the plea deal will give Hernandez three years' probation and he will not have to register as a sex offender; if not, Hernandez could face up to three years in prison. In a January 2018 court hearing, it was revealed that Hernandez had failed his GED test, but had his sentencing adjourned until April 10, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Mojica |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/6ix9ine-fails-ged-test/ |title=Judge Gives 6ix9ine One Last Chance to Pass GED Test |website=XXL |date=January 30, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201222959/http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/6ix9ine-fails-ged-test/ |archivedate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rich Juzwiak |url=https://jezebel.com/sentencing-in-rapper-6ix9ines-child-sex-case-delayed-be-1822557621 |title=Sentencing in Rapper 6ix9ine's Child Sex Case Delayed Because He Failed His GED |work=Jezebel |date=January 30, 2018 |accessdate=April 5, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201022908/https://jezebel.com/sentencing-in-rapper-6ix9ines-child-sex-case-delayed-be-1822557621 |archivedate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court date was later postponed, reportedly because the court did not have a copy of Hernandez's GED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joshua Espinoza |title=6ix9ine's Court Date in Child Sex Case Postponed |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/04/tekashi-6ix9ine-court-date-postponed-deletes-instagram-posts-drops-gotti-track |website=Complex |accessdate=June 9, 2018 |date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his sexual misconduct charges, Hernandez served jail time as a minor for assault and the sale of heroin.&lt;ref name="Genius" /&gt;

On July 12, 2018, Hernandez was arrested in New York for an outstanding warrant related to an incident where he allegedly choked a 16-year-old in [[Houston]]'s [[The Galleria|Galleria mall]] in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Strauss |first1=Matthew |title=6ix9ine Arrested for Allegedly Choking 16-Year-Old |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/6ix9ine-arrested-for-allegedly-choking-16-year-old/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=July 11, 2018 |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning hours of July 22, 2018, Hernandez was kidnapped, beaten, and robbed by three armed assailants in Brooklyn. He had finished shooting the music video for "FEFE" (featuring [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Murda Beatz]]) when the assailants grabbed him outside his home and pistol-whipped him. The robbers eventually took over $750,000 in custom jewelry and approximately $35,000 in cash. Hernandez escaped from their vehicle and summoned police help via a stranger. He was taken to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tekashi 6ix9ine Kidnapped, Robbed and Hospitalized (Report)|url=https://variety.com/2018/music/news/tekashi-6ix9ine-kidnapped-robbed-hospitalized-1202880725/|work=Variety|date=July 22, 2018|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his continuing legal problems in light of his plea bargain, the Manhattan district attorney's office announced Hernandez could face up to three years in prison and possible [[Sex offender registry#In the United States|sex offender registration]] for his 2015 case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/08/6ix9ine-jail-sex-offender-sentencing/|title=6ix9ine Could Face Prison in 2015 Sexual Misconduct Case|date=August 9, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was instead sentenced to four years' probation starting in October 2018, with one clause being that he cannot utter the phrase “[[Tr3yway|Treyway]]” in public as it was deemed to promote gang activity, as well as 1,000 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Klinkenberg |first1=Brendan |title=Tekashi 6ix9ine Sentenced to 4 Years Probation |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tekashi-6ix9ine-probation-747879/ |accessdate=October 26, 2018 |work=Rolling Stone |date=October 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moynihan |first1=Colin |title=Rapper 6ix9ine Sentenced to Probation in Sex Video Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/arts/tekashi-6ix9ine-sentencing-probation.html |accessdate=November 5, 2018 |work=New York Times |date=October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 2018, two members of Hernandez's entourage were involved in a shooting in [[Manhattan]] and were subsequently charged with gang assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Police Arrest 2 in Shooting Involving Rapper Tekashi69 |url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Police-Arrest-2-in-Shooting-Involving-Rapper-Tekashi69-498791211.html |work=NBC New York |agency=Associated Press |date=October 27, 2018 |access-date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2018, Hernandez, his former manager Kifano "Shotti" Jordan, and three other associates were arrested. Hernandez is charged with federal [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] and firearms charges, including conspiracy to murder and armed robbery, and faces up to life in prison.

Hernandez’s legal team plans to appeal that decision.

This sensory information is transmitted by the [[posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway]] of the spinal cord, which also carries the sensations of [[fine touch]], [[stereognosis]], tactile pressure, [[graphesthesia]], texture recognition, [[kinesthesia]], [[two-point discrimination]], [[proprioception]], and [[vibration]].

To test for intact barognosis, a set of small objects with the same size and shape but of graduated weight is used.  A series of different weights can be placed one at a time in the same hand, and the patient is asked to identify the comparative weight of the objects, i.e. by saying whether the object is "heavier" or "lighter".  Other methods for testing include different weights being placed in each hand simultaneously, or having the patient pick up each weight using a fingertip grip.&lt;ref&gt;

On the right of the camera is the producer, Captain L Hamilton-Webb, while around the microphone are Staff Captain Jackson and brothers Louis and Ted De Rosa.]]

Produced by the Directorate for Army Welfare (DAK) in [[British Raj|India]] from 1944 to 46, '''''Calling Blighty''''' was a series of ten-minute films which featured members of the [[British Armed Forces]] stationed in India and [[Southeast Asia]] speaking a personal message direct to camera. These films were shown back in the UK to a specially invited audience in a cinema in the area from which those featured came.

== Background ==
Poor welfare and especially length of tour duty, crystallised in the phrase "the Forgotten Army", led the [[War Office]] to investigate the significant issue of morale, which culminated in a tour of [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC) by the [[Geoffrey FitzClarence, 5th Earl of Munster|Earl of Munster]] and his subsequent report in September 1944, although a Morale Committee had met regularly in the War Office since 1942.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"&gt;Sargent, Paul.  November 1992, "'Keep Smiling. Keep those chins up and God bless': filmed messages home from service personnel in the Far East during the Second World War." ''Imperial War Museum Review No. 7''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Calling Blighty'' was one of the steps introduced by the War Office to address concerns of low morale within the 14th Army stationed in India and SEAC during the latter stages of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt;

The series title was probably derived from a [[Pathé News|Pathé Gazette]] newsreel issue of early 1944 featuring soldiers based in Italy and the first DAK ''Calling Blighty'' was issued in April 1944.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt; The production was based at what was then the Training Film Centre in [[Bombay]], already a film production centre for the making of training films for the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]], (and later to become the Combined Kinematograph Services Film Production and Training Centre – CKS), with studio space rented at the Shree Sound Studios.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Adam.  Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12358. Mr Dawson worked both as a director and supervising film editor at the CKS.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Calling Blighty'' was produced in two different formats: one was studio-based and the other shot on location. In the studio a canteen set was built to provide a realistic and relaxing environment and personnel were brought in to deliver their messages. On location the unit had to find the personnel – and they travelled widely, through India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]] – whom they filmed outside, usually with some significant landmark behind them. The format was similar to the canteen set-up, with each person addressing their loved ones with a short message direct to camera.&lt;ref name="atcheler1991"&gt;Atcheler, Jack. Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12357 Mr Atcheler was a cameraman on the ''Calling Blighty'' location unit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equipment used by both studio and location units was broadly the same; 35mm camera, film and sound equipment. In 1945 the cumbersome separate sound camera was replaced by a sound-on-film camera similar to those used for newsreels. The studio had a permanent complement of staff consisting of Indian as well as British personnel. The location unit usually comprised a director, two cameramen, two sound recordists, two assistants and a welfare officer responsible for making the contacts. At least one of the location units operated as part of the [[Army Kinematograph Service]] (AKS) and had been sent out from the [[UK]] to assist.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt;{{rp|33}}&lt;ref name="atcheler1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Indian documentary maker NS Thapa was a studio-based cameraman on ''Calling Blighty''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, people from one particular city, town or region were grouped together in order to facilitate screening back in the UK, and while personnel from all three services are featured, they are predominantly from the army.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt; The completed negatives were sent by sea to the UK, a journey of about six weeks. On arrival the negative was sent to [[Denham Film Studios|Denham Studios]] near [[Uxbridge]], [[Middlesex]], where a print was made for distribution, although a copy was kept in Bombay as a precaution against the negative being lost.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becket, Albert.  Sound Archives 1991, Imperial War Museum ref 12356. Mr Becket was Production Manager at the CKS from May 1945 until August 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''Calling Blighty'' screening took place at a cinema in the subjects local area and was usually organised by the regional Army Welfare Committee. The names and addresses of those to be invited were sent to the UK along with the films.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt;

These films continued to be produced after the [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945 as many thousands of service personnel were still needed in SEAC; transport and forces were still required for the occupation of Malaya, [[Java]] and the return of thousands of prisoners of war, as well as for the occupation of Japan. Production of ''Calling Blighty'' finally ceased in April 1946.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt;

It is estimated that only slightly more than 10% of the ''Calling Blighty'' films have survived - some 52 issues.&lt;ref name="sargent1992"/&gt; It is estimated some 400 issues were produced, the majority of the originals – 47 – are held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] Film Archive. An additional five are held by the [[British Film Institute]] National Film Archive. Copies of all Manchester issues are held by the North West Film Archive at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] who are running a project to trace all family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwfa.mmu.ac.uk/blighty/index.php |title=Messages Home: Lost Films of the British Army |website=North West Film Archive |date=2016 |publisher=Manchester Metropolitan University |access-date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual copies relating to [[Norwich]] and [[Southampton]] are held by the relevant regional film archives.

The '''carbon cycle''' is the [[biogeochemical cycle]] by which [[carbon]] is exchanged among the [[biosphere]], [[pedosphere]], [[geosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of the Earth]]. Carbon is the main component of biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone. Along with the [[nitrogen cycle]] and the [[water cycle]], the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long-term processes of [[carbon sequestration]] to and release from [[carbon sink]]s.

The carbon cycle was discovered by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], and popularized by [[Humphry Davy]].&lt;ref name="AOW"&gt;Holmes, Richard (2008). "The Age Of Wonder", Pantheon Books. {{ISBN|978-0-375-42222-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global carbon cycle is now usually divided into the following major reservoirs of carbon interconnected by pathways of exchange:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=David|title=The global carbon cycle|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400837076}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–6}}
* The [[atmosphere]]
* The terrestrial [[biosphere]]
* The [[World Ocean|ocean]], including [[total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] and living and non-living marine biota
* The [[sediment]]s, including [[fossil fuel]]s, freshwater systems, and non-living organic material.
* The Earth's interior ([[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[crust (geology)|crust]]). These carbon stores interact with the other components through geological processes.

The carbon exchanges between reservoirs occur as the result of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;

Carbon in the Earth's atmosphere exists in two main forms: [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]].

Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere primarily through [[photosynthesis]] and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water (ocean, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms [[carbonic acid]], which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. It also can acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean.&lt;ref name=Planet&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Many Planets, One Earth // Section 4: Carbon Cycling and Earth's Climate |url=http://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/unit/text.php?unit=1&amp;secNum=4 |journal=Many Planets, One Earth |volume=4 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activities over the past two centuries have significantly increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, both by modifying ecosystems' ability to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and by emitting it directly, e.g., by burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete.&lt;ref name="GlobalCarbonCycle"/&gt;

===Terrestrial biosphere===
{{Main|Terrestrial biological carbon cycle}}
[[File:SRS1000 being used to measure soil respiration in the field..jpg|thumb|right|A portable soil respiration system measuring soil {{CO2}} flux]]
The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all land-living organisms, both alive and dead, as well as carbon stored in [[soil]]s. About 500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms,&lt;ref name=Prentice_etal_2001/&gt; while soil holds approximately 1,500 gigatons of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=Charles W.|title=Storing carbon in soil: Why and how?|journal=Geotimes|date=January 2002|volume=47|issue=1|pages=14&amp;ndash;17|url=http://www.geotimes.org/jan02/feature_carbon.html|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/gcbb.12401|title=Investigating the biochar effects on C-mineralization and sequestration of carbon in soil compared with conventional amendments using the stable isotope (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) approach|journal=GCB Bioenergy|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1085–1099|year=2016|last1=Yousaf|first1=Balal|last2=Liu|first2=Guijian|last3=Wang|first3=Ruwei|last4=Abbas|first4=Qumber|last5=Imtiaz|first5=Muhammad|last6=Liu|first6=Ruijia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms, such as [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref name=Lal-2008&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1039/b809492f |title=Sequestration of atmospheric {{CO2}} in global carbon pools |last=Lal |first=Rattan |journal=Energy and Environmental Science |volume=1 |pages=86–100 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on earth. [[Autotrophs]] extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide, converting it into organic carbon, while [[heterotrophs]] receive carbon by consuming other organisms.

Because carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere is dependent on biotic factors, it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle. In {{CO2}} measurements, this feature is apparent in the [[Keeling curve]]. It is strongest in the northern [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]] because this hemisphere has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon.

Carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere in several ways and on different time scales. The [[combustion]] or [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere. It can also be exported into the ocean through rivers or remain sequestered in soils in the form of inert carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Mingxu|last2=Peng|first2=Changhui|last3=Wang|first3=Meng|last4=Xue|first4=Wei|last5=Zhang|first5=Kerou|last6=Wang|first6=Kefeng|last7=Shi|first7=Guohua|last8=Zhu|first8=Qiuan|date=2017-09|title=The carbon flux of global rivers: A re-evaluation of amount and spatial patterns|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=80|pages=40–51|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.049|issn=1470-160X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by [[erosion]] or released into the atmosphere through [[soil respiration]]. Between 1989 and 2008 soil respiration increased by about 0.1% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond-Lamberty|first1=Ben|last2=Thomson|first2=Allison|title=Temperature-associated increases in the global soil respiration record|journal=Nature|date=25 March 2010|volume=464|issue=7288|pages=579–582|doi=10.1038/nature08930|pmid=20336143|bibcode=2010Natur.464..579B}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the global total of {{CO2}} released by soil respiration was roughly 98 billion tonnes, about 10 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel (this does not represent a net transfer of carbon from soil to atmosphere, as the respiration is largely offset by inputs to soil carbon). There are a few plausible explanations for this trend, but the most likely explanation is that increasing temperatures have increased rates of decomposition of [[soil organic matter]], which has increased the flow of {{CO2}}. The length of carbon sequestering in soil is dependent on local climatic conditions and thus changes in the course of [[climate change]]. &lt;!-- From pre-industrial era to 2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric {{CO2}} prior to 1940, switching subsequently to a net sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, Junling and McElroy, Michael B. |url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10981610/The%20contemporary%20and%20historical%20budget%20of%20atmospheric%20CO2_1%202.pdf?sequence=9 |title=The Contemporary and Historical Budget of Atmospheric {{CO2}}|journal=Canadian Journal of Physics |volume = 90 | issue = 8  | pages = 707–716 |year=2012 |doi=10.1139/p2012-033|bibcode = 2012CaJPh..90..707H }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Ocean===
{{Main|Oceanic carbon cycle}}
The ocean can be conceptually divided into a [[surface layer]] within which water makes frequent (daily to annual) contact with the atmosphere, and a deep layer below the typically [[mixed layer]] depth of a few hundred meters or less, within which the time between consecutive contacts may be centuries. The  dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface layer is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere, maintaining equilibrium. Partly because its concentration of DIC is about 15% higher&lt;ref name=Sarmiento_and_Gruber_2006&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sarmiento |first1=J.L. |last2=Gruber |first2=N. |title=Ocean Biogeochemical Dynamics |year=2006 |publisher=Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mainly due to its larger volume, the deep ocean contains far more carbon—it's the largest pool of actively cycled carbon in the world, containing 50 times more than the atmosphere&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;—but the timescale to reach equilibrium with the atmosphere is hundreds of years: the exchange of carbon between the two layers, driven by [[thermohaline circulation]], is slow.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;

Carbon enters the ocean mainly through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a small fraction of which is converted into [[carbonate]]. It can also enter the ocean through rivers as [[dissolved organic carbon]]. It is converted by organisms into organic carbon through [[photosynthesis]] and can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the ocean's deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells as [[calcium carbonate]]. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or, eventually, returned to the surface waters through thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref name=Prentice_etal_2001/&gt; Oceans are basic (~pH 8.2), hence {{CO2}} acidification shifts the pH of the ocean towards neutral.   

Oceanic absorption of {{CO2}} is one of the most important forms of [[carbon sequestering]] limiting the human-caused rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, this process is limited by a number of factors. &lt;!--Because the carbonate buffering of {{CO2}} in the ocean is dependent on the weathering of rocks and this process takes place slower than current rates of human greenhouse gas emissions, absorption of {{CO2}} by the surface ocean will decrease in the future.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;--&gt; {{CO2}} absorption makes water more acidic, which affects ocean biosystems. The projected rate of increasing [[Ocean acidification|oceanic acidity]] could slow the biological precipitation of [[calcium carbonate]]s, thus decreasing the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=Klyepas1999&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kleypas |first1=J.

&lt;!--According to a study done by Dr. Grace Saba of Rutgers University and Professor Deborah Steinberg of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science marine organisms such as copepods and other small drifting organisms play a key role in the biological pump by feeding on the photosynthetic algae on the surface then releasing the carbon they've ingested as "fecal pellets". These pellets rapidly sink to the bottom of the ocean; releasing carbon into the deep sea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}--&gt;

===Earth's interior===
The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Slow Carbon Cycle |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/CarbonCycle/page2.php |author=NASA |accessdate=2012-06-24

Most of the earth's carbon is stored inertly in the earth's [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt; Much of the carbon stored in the earth's mantle was stored there when the earth formed.&lt;ref name=DiVenere2012&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/carbon.htm The Carbon Cycle and Earth's Climate] Information sheet for Columbia University Summer Session 2012 Earth and Environmental Sciences Introduction to Earth Sciences I&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it was deposited in the form of organic carbon from the biosphere.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berner|first1=Robert A.|title=A New Look at the Long-term Carbon Cycle|journal=GSA Today|date=November 1999|volume=9|issue=11|pages=1&amp;ndash;6|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e2c5/d2eb552fa447ded17dfb920e9ebb668c8d68.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the carbon stored in the geosphere, about 80% is [[limestone]] and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of [[calcium carbonate]] stored in the shells of marine organisms. The remaining 20% is stored as [[kerogen]]s formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure. Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there for millions of years.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;

Carbon can leave the geosphere in several ways. Carbon dioxide is released during the [[Metamorphism (geology)|metamorphosis]] of carbonate rocks when they are [[Subduction|subducted]] into the earth's mantle. This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through [[Volcanism|volcanoes]] and [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]].&lt;ref name=DiVenere2012/&gt; It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens in the form of [[fossil fuels]]. After extraction, fossil fuels are burned to release energy, thus emitting the carbon they store into the atmosphere

Since the [[industrial revolution]], human activity has modified the carbon cycle by changing its components' functions and directly adding carbon to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;

The largest human impact on the carbon cycle is through direct emissions from burning [[fossil fuels]], which transfers carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use, [[Deforestation and climate change|particularly deforestation]].

Another direct human impact on the carbon cycle is the chemical process of [[calcination]] of [[limestone]] for [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] production, which releases {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2007) [https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch7s7-4-5.html 7.4.5 Minerals] in ''Climate Change 2007'': Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change,&lt;/ref&gt; Clinker is an industrial [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[cement]].

Humans also influence the carbon cycle indirectly by changing the terrestrial and oceanic biosphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0070457108703388|title=Developments in Sedimentology|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|editor-last=Morse|editor-first=John W.|series=Geochemistry of Sedimentary Carbonates|volume=48|pages=447–510|editor-last2=Mackenzie|editor-first2=Fred T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human-caused [[land use]] and land cover change (LUCC) has led to the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. [[Deforestation]] for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon so that the net product of the process is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere.

Other human-caused changes to the environment change ecosystems' productivity and their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. [[Air pollution]], for example, damages plants and soils, while many agricultural and land use practices lead to higher [[erosion]] rates, washing carbon out of soils and decreasing plant productivity.
&lt;!--
Higher temperatures and {{CO2}} levels in the atmosphere increase decomposition rates in soil, thus returning {{CO2}} stored in plant material more quickly to the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

However, increased levels of {{CO2}} in the atmosphere can also lead to higher gross primary production. It increases photosynthesis rates by allowing plants to more efficiently use water, because they no longer need to leave their [[stomata]] open for such long periods of time in order to absorb the same amount of carbon dioxide. This type of carbon dioxide fertilization affects mainly [[C3 plants]], because [[C4 plants]] can already concentrate {{CO2}} effectively.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}--&gt;

On 12 November 2015, [[NASA]] scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) [[Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere|continues to increase]], reaching levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years: currently, the rate carbon dioxide released by the burning of fossil fuels is about double the net uptake by vegetation and the ocean.&lt;ref name="NASA-20151112-ab"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Buis |first1=Alan |last2=Ramsayer |first2=Kate |last3=Rasmussen |first3=Carol |title=A Breathing Planet, Off Balance |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4769 |date=12 November 2015 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20151112b"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Audio (66:01) - NASA News Conference - Carbon &amp; Climate Telecon |url=http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/77531778 |date=12 November 2015 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20151110"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Atmospheric Greenhouse Gas Levels Hit Record, Report Says |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/science/atmospheric-greenhouse-gas-levels-hit-record-report-says.html |date=10 November 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20151109"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=Karl |title=UK: In 1st, global temps average could be 1 degree C higher |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20151109/climate_countdown-greenhouse_gases-d8a21f0397.html |date=9 November 2015 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''compensated pulsed alternator''', also known by the [[portmanteau]] ''compulsator'', is a form of [[power supply]].

As the name suggests, it is an [[alternator]] that is "compensated" (see below) to make it better at delivering pulses of electrical energy than a normal alternator.

==Description and operation==

{{See also|Flywheel energy storage}}

The principle is very similar to an alternator, except the rotor is usually kept spinning by its [[inertia]] (having been "spun up" by an external motor, or the compulsator itself having been used in reverse as an AC motor) and the small matter of the "compensation". The compulsator is used like a [[capacitor]], to gather energy from a low-power source and store it, then generate a high-power output for a short period.

The [[Compensation winding|windings]] of a compulsator are different from those of a normal alternator in being designed for minimal [[inductance]]. This allows the current in the windings to change very rapidly, which is why this "compensation" makes it better at delivering pulses.

The kinetic energy of a rotating object depends on the mass of the object, the shape of the object, and the square of the speed of rotation. Therefore, compulsators tend to have very light rotors spinning very fast in order to store the most energy in the available mass, and because too much mass in the rotor causes problems with the magnitude of [[centripetal force]] required to prevent the rotor from flying apart.

== Usage ==

Compulsators are popular choices for high-end [[railgun]] power supplies.

One possibility being considered is to build an electric [[tank]] using a conventional diesel engine for propulsion and to charge a compulsator. The compulsator would be used to power a railgun, and potentially other [[pulsed energy weapon]]s (particularly [[electronic warfare]] systems); also, the compulsator could be used in non-pulsed mode to drive a tank with electric motors for limited periods as a kind of "quiet mode", which could be useful in urban combat.

'''Daudi Migereko''' was the minister of lands, housing and urban development in the [[cabinet of Uganda]]. He was appointed to that position on 27 May 2011. He replaced [[Omara Atubo]], who was dropped from the cabinet. In the cabinet reshuffle of 2016, the president dropped him from this position and replaced him with [[Betty Amongi]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/755941 |title=Museveni Names New Cabinet |date=28 May 2011 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |first=Henry |last=Mukasa |newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211124001/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/755941 |archivedate=11 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 16 February 2009 until 27 May 2011, he served as the government's [[chief whip]] in the [[parliament of Uganda]]. Before that, he was the minister of energy and mineral development in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

==Background and education==
Migereko was born on 26 June 1956 in Jinja District. He graduated from [[Makerere University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a Diploma in Education. His [[Master of Arts]] in transport planning and marketing was obtained from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.parliament.go.ug/mpdata/mps.hei?p=f&amp;n=t&amp;details=t&amp;j=161&amp;const=Butembe++County&amp;dist_id=19&amp;distname=Jinja|title=Profile of Migereko Daudi, MP For Butembe County, Jinja District | last=Uganda Parliament | publisher=[[Parliament of Uganda]] | date=2011 | accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work history==
Between 1986 and 2001, he was the director of operations at Intraco Uganda Limited, a private business. During the same period, he also served as a director on the board of [[FINCA]], a Ugandan [[microfinance]] company. In 1996, he was elected to represent Butembe County, Jinja District in the parliament. He has been re-elected to that seat ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

Edward [[Levett]] Darwin was the son of Sir [[Francis Sacheverel Darwin]] and his wife Jane Harriet Ryle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He grew up at [[Breadsall Priory]], near Derby.  He was a captain in the [[Sherwood Foresters|Derby Regiment of Militia]] from 1856.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wishful-thinking.org.uk/genuki/DBY/Buxton/MIs.html Some Memorial Inscriptions, St John the Baptist Churchyard and Buxton Cemetery, Buxton, Derbyshire]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 he married Harriett Jessopp, (1825 &amp;ndash; 1889), daughter of Francis and Ann Jessopp of Derby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Francis Jessopp was once Derby's solicitor and an attorney, owner of Jacobean House and under-sheriff for the county of Derbyshire.) The 1851 Census records Darwin and his wife residing at Dale House in [[Matlock Bath]] with his occupation as solicitor (attorney), while [[Kelly's Directory]] of 1855 records him as a solicitor living in [[Matlock Bath]]. Darwin had settled in the area where Erasmus Darwin had recommended the waters to [[Josiah Wedgwood]].

Edward Levett Darwin is buried along with his wife in the churchyard of St John the Baptist's Church at [[Burbage, Derbyshire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1160">The '''Eltonian niche''' is an [[ecological niche]] that emphasizes the functional attributes of animals and their corresponding [[trophic level|trophic]] position. This was the definition [[Eugene Odum]] popularized in his analogy of the [[ecological niche|niche]] of a species with its profession in the ecosystem as opposed to the [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] being its address. The definition is attributed to [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] in his 1927 now classic book ''Animal Ecology''.&lt;ref&gt;Elton, C.(1927) Animal Ecology. Sidgwick and Jackson, London. Reprinted several times, e.g. 2001 by The University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-20639-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elton used the two [[Africa]]n [[Rhinoceros]] species to exemplify the definition. The [[White Rhinoceros]] has broad (wide, hence its [[White_Rhinoceros#Naming|name]]) mouthparts, which are efficient in harvesting  grass, while the [[Black Rhinoceros]] has narrow pointed lips enabling it to feed selectively on the foliage of thorny bushes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6467">[[Image:eej cm4.png|thumb|400px|A snapshot of the variation of the Earth’s magnetic field from its intrinsic field at 400&amp;nbsp;km altitude, due to the ionsopheric current systems. The equatorial intensification of the magnetic field is due to the equatorial electrojet (EEJ). The EEJ peaks over the Indian Ocean at the point in time depicted. The map was generated using a geomagnetic field model.]]

The '''equatorial electrojet''' ('''EEJ''') is a narrow ribbon of current flowing eastward in the day time equatorial region of the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. The abnormally large amplitude of variations in the horizontal components measured at equatorial [[geomagnetic]] observatories, as a result of EEJ, was noticed as early as 1920 from [[Huancayo]] geomagnetic observatory. Observations by radar, rockets, satellites, and geomagnetic observatories are used to study EEJ.

== Causes ==
The explanation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |first1=W. G. |last1=Baker |first2=D. F.|last2=Martyn |year=1953 |title=Electric currents in the ionosphere I. The conductivity |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A |volume=246 |pages=281–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the existence of the equatorial electrojet lies with the anisotropic nature of ionospheric electrical conductivity and a process of self-reinforcement. Global-scale ionospheric circulation establishes a Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere (100&amp;ndash;130&amp;nbsp;km altitude), and a primary eastwards electric field near day-side magnetic equator, where the magnetic field is horizontal and northwards. This electric field gives a primary eastwards [[Pedersen current]]. [[Guiding center|E cross B drift]] results in a downwards [[Hall current]], sustaining vertical charge separation across the depth of the ionosphere, giving an upwards secondary electric field and a secondary Pedersen current that is opposite to the primary Hall current. A secondary Hall current then reinforces the original Pedersen current. At about 110&amp;nbsp;km height, the integration of the current density gives a peak current strength of about 100 kA, which supports a day-side electrojet magnetic-field enhancement of a factor of two or so.

== Studies of the EEJ from satellite and ground magnetic data ==
The EEJ phenomenon was first identified using geomagnetic data. The amplitude of the daily variation of the horizontal magnetic intensity (Δ'''H''') measured at a geomagnetic observatory near the dip-equator is 3–5 fold higher than the variation of data from other regions of Earth. A typical diurnal equatorial observatory data show a peak of strength ~80 nT at 12:00 LT, with respect to the night-time level.  Egedal (1947) showed that the enhancement of quiet day solar daily variations in Δ'''H''' (Sq('''H''')) lay within  the 50 latitude centered on the dip equator. The mechanism that produced the variation in the magnetic field was proposed as a band of current about 300&amp;nbsp;km in width flowing over the dip equator.

EEJ studies from satellite data were initiated with the arrival of data from the POGO (Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatories) series of satellite (1967–1970). The characteristic signature of the EEJ is a sharp negative V-shaped curve in the &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;H field, attaining its minimum within 0.5° of the magnetic dip equator. The magnetic data from satellite missions like [[Ørsted (satellite)|Ørsted]] (1999–present) and CHAMP (2000–present) have vastly improved our knowledge of the EEJ.

Recent studies have focused on the lunar-solar interaction is the EEJ. It was demonstrated that complexity is introduced into the EEJ due to the interaction between lunar tide variability in the equatorial electric field and solar-driven variability in the E-region conductivity.

The term '''foo fighter''' was used by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[aircraft pilot]]s in [[World War II]] to describe various [[unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or mysterious aerial [[phenomena]] seen in the skies over both the [[European Theater of Operations|European]] and [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] theaters of operations.

Though "foo fighter" initially described a type of UFO reported and named by the U.S. [[415th Night Fighter Squadron]], the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period.&lt;ref name=toomey&gt;{{cite book | last = Toomey | first = Vurlee A. | authorlink = | title = Let Us Not Forget: A Tribute to America's 20th Century Veterans | publisher = iUniverse | date = 2002 | location = | page = 71 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-595-23823-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally reported from November 1944 onwards, witnesses often assumed that the foo fighters were secret weapons employed by the enemy.

The [[Robertson Panel]] explored possible explanations, for instance that they were [[electrostatic]] phenomena similar to [[St. Elmo's fire]], [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic]] phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals.&lt;ref name="ufoevidence.org"&gt;[http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1419.htm Report of Scientific Advisory Panel on Unidentified Flying Objects convened by Office of Scientific Intelligence, CIA January 14–18, 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[nonsense word]] "[[foobar|foo]]" emerged in popular culture during the early 1930s, first being used by cartoonist [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], who peppered his ''[[Smokey Stover]]''&lt;ref&gt;See for instance;&lt;br /&gt;Holman, "Smokey Stover – A Dead Ringer", ''Daily News'', 21 November 1938, [http://www.smokey-stover.com/deadringer.html retrieved 6 Feb 2009],&lt;br /&gt;Holman, "Smokey Stover – Movie Idle", ''Daily News'', 23 November 1938, [http://www.smokey-stover.com/movieidle.html retrieved 6 Feb 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; fireman cartoon strips with "foo" signs and puns.&lt;ref&gt;Moira Davison Reynolds, ''Comic Strip Artists in American Newspapers, 1945–1980'', p. 94, McFarland, 2003 {{ISBN|0-7864-1551-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coulton Waugh, ''The Comics'', p. 316, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 1991 {{ISBN|0-87805-499-5}} (modern reprint first published 1947).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RFC3092"&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3092.html RFC3092 – Etymology of "Foo"], [[Internet Society]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "foo" was borrowed from Bill Holman's ''Smokey Stover'' by a radar operator in the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who (it is agreed by most 415th members) gave the foo fighters their name. Meiers was from Chicago and was an avid reader of Bill Holman's strip, which was run daily in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Smokey Stover's catch-phrase was "where there's foo, there's fire". In a mission debriefing on the evening November 27, 1944, Fritz Ringwald, the unit's S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them through a variety of high-speed maneuvers. Fritz said that Meiers was extremely agitated and had a copy of the comic strip tucked in his back pocket. He pulled it out and slammed it down on Fritz's desk and said "... it was another one of those fuckin' foo fighters!" and stormed out of the debriefing room.&lt;ref name="Jeffery A Lindell 1991"&gt;Jeffery A. Lindell, 1991. "Interviews with Harold Augspurger, Commander 415th Night Fighter Squadron; Frederic Ringwald, S-2 Intelligence Officer, 415th Night Fighter Squadron".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fritz Ringwald, because of the lack of a better name, it stuck. And this was originally what the men of the 415th started calling these incidents: "fuckin' foo fighters". In December 1944, a press correspondent from the [[Associated Press]] in Paris, Bob Wilson, was sent to the 415th at their base outside of [[Dijon]], France to investigate this story.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times''. "Balls of Fire Stalk U.S. Fighters in Night Assaults Over Germany". (A.P.) 2 Jan. 1945. p. 1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that the term was cleaned up to just "foo fighters". The squadron commander, Capt. Harold Augsperger, also decided to sanitize the term to "foo fighters" in the historical data of the squadron.&lt;ref name="Jeffery A Lindell 1991"/&gt;

==History==
The first sightings occurred in November 1944, when pilots flying over [[Western Europe]] by night reported seeing fast-moving round glowing objects following their aircraft. The objects were variously described as fiery, and glowing red, white, or orange. Some pilots described them as resembling Christmas-tree lights and reported that they seemed to toy with the aircraft, making wild turns before simply vanishing. Pilots and aircrew reported that the objects flew formation with their aircraft and behaved as if they were under intelligent control, but never displayed hostile behavior. However, they could not be outmaneuvered or shot down. The phenomenon was so widespread that the lights earned a name – in the European Theater of Operations they were often called "Kraut fireballs", but for the most part called "foo-fighters". The military took the sightings seriously, suspecting that the mysterious sightings might be secret German weapons, but further investigation revealed that German and Japanese pilots had reported similar sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lucanio | first = Patrick | authorlink = |author2=Gary Coville | title = Smokin' Rockets: The Romance of Technology in American Film, Radio and Television, 1945–1962 | publisher = McFarland | date = 2002 | location = | pages = 16–17 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7864-1233-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 1944, the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] in Paris issued a press release, which was featured in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' on the next day, officially describing the phenomenon as a "new German weapon". Follow-up stories, using the term "Foo Fighters", appeared in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and the British ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hayward | first = James | authorlink = | title = Myths and Legends of the Second World War| publisher = Isis | date = 2003 | location = | pages = 343–344 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7531-5664-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 15 January 1945 edition, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine carried a story entitled "Foo-Fighter", in which it reported that the "balls of fire" had been following [[USAAF]] [[Night fighter|nightfighters]] for over a month, and that the pilots had named it the "foo-fighter". According to ''Time'', descriptions of the phenomena varied, but the pilots agreed that the mysterious lights followed their aircraft closely at high speed.&lt;ref name=time19450115&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Foo-Fighter | newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | pages = | date = 15 Jan 1945 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,775433,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "balls of fire" phenomenon reported from the Pacific Theater of Operations differed somewhat from the foo fighters reported from Europe; the "ball of fire" resembled a large burning sphere which "just hung in the sky", though it was reported to sometimes follow aircraft. On one occasion, one of the gunners of a [[B-29]] aircraft hit one with gunfire, causing it to break up into several large pieces that fell on buildings below and set them on fire.{{cn|date=October 2017}} There was speculation that the phenomena could be related to the Japanese [[fire balloon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; campaign. As with the European foo fighters, no aircraft were reported as having been attacked by a "ball of fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Robertson, Jr. | first = Gordon Bennett | authorlink = | title = Bringing the Thunder: The Missions of a World War II B-29 Pilot in the Pacific | publisher = Stackpole Books | date = 2006 | location = | pages = 183–185 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8117-3333-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postwar [[Robertson Panel]] cited foo fighter reports, noting that their behavior did not appear to be threatening, and mentioned possible explanations, for instance that they were [[electrostatic]] phenomena similar to [[St. Elmo's fire]], [[Electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic]] phenomena, or simply reflections of light from ice crystals. The Panel's report suggested that "If the term "flying saucers" had been popular in 1943–1945, these objects would have been so labeled."&lt;ref name="ufoevidence.org"/&gt;

===Sightings===
Foo fighters were reported on many occasions from around the world; a few examples are noted below.

* Sighting from September 1941 in the [[Indian Ocean]] was similar to some later foo fighter reports. From the deck of the S.S. ''Pułaski'' (a [[Poland|Polish]] merchant vessel transporting British troops), two sailors reported a "strange globe glowing with greenish light, about half the size of the full moon as it appears to us."&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1998 p 230&lt;/ref&gt; They alerted a British officer, who watched the movements of the object with them for over an hour.
* Charles R. Bastien of the [[Eighth Air Force]] reported one of the first encounters with foo fighters over the [[Belgium]]/[[Netherlands]] area; he described them as "two fog lights flying at high {{sic|rates |hide=y"|of speed}} that could change direction rapidly". During debriefing, his intelligence officer told him that two RAF nightfighters had reported the same thing, and it was later reported in British newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bastien | first = Charles R. | authorlink = | title = 32 Copilots | publisher = Trafford Publishing | date = 2004 | location = | page = 205 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4120-1729-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Career [[U.S. Air Force]] pilot Duane Adams often related that he had witnessed two occurrences of a bright light which paced his aircraft for about half an hour and then rapidly ascended into the sky. Both incidents occurred at night, both over the South Pacific, and both were witnessed by the entire aircraft crew. The first sighting occurred shortly after the end of World War II while Adams piloted a [[B-25]] bomber. The second sighting occurred in the early 1960s when Adams was piloting a [[KC-135]] tanker.

==Explanations and theories==
The author Renato Vesco revived the wartime theory that the foo fighters were a Nazi secret weapon in his work ''Intercept UFO'', reprinted in a revised English edition as ''Man-Made UFOs: 50 Years Of Suppression'' in 1994. Vesco claims that the foo fighters were in fact a form of ground-launched, automatically guided, jet-propelled [[flak]] mine called the ''Feuerball'' (Fireball). This device, supposedly operated by special [[SS]] units,  resembled a [[tortoise]] shell in shape, and it flew by means of gas jets that spun like a [[Catherine wheel (firework)|Catherine wheel]] around the fuselage. Miniature [[klystron]] tubes inside the device, in combination with the gas jets, created the characteristic glowing spheroid appearance of the foo fighters. A crude form of collision avoidance radar ensured the craft would not crash into another airborne object, and an onboard sensor mechanism would even instruct the machine to depart swiftly if it was fired upon. The purpose of the ''Feuerball'', according to Vesco, was twofold. The appearance of this weird device inside a bomber stream would (and indeed did) have a distracting and disruptive effect on the bomber pilots. Also, Vesco alleges that the devices were also intended to have an "offensive" capability. [[Electrostatic]] discharges from the klystron tubes would, he stated, interfere with the ignition systems of the engines of the bombers, causing the planes to crash. Although there is no hard evidence to support the reality of the ''Feuerball'' drone, this theory has been taken up by other aviation/ufology authors, and it has even been cited by some as the most likely explanation for the phenomena -- in at least one recent TV "documentary" on [[Wunderwaffen|Nazi Secret Weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;Renato Vesco, David Hatcher Childress, ''Man-made UFOs 1944–1994: 50 years of suppression'', Adventures Unlimited Press, 1994 {{ISBN|0-932813-23-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renato Vesco, ''Intercept UFO'', Pinnacle Books, 1974 {{ISBN|0-523-00840-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although others cite the single sourced nature of the claims, the complete lack of evidence supporting them, and the implausible capabilities of the supposed device as nonsense. &lt;ref&gt;The Nazi UFO Mythos [http://naziufomythos.greyfalcon.us/renatovesco.html] The Nazi UFO Mythos: An Investigation 
by Kevin McClure&lt;/ref&gt;

Any type of electrical discharge from the wings of airplanes (see [[St. Elmo's Fire]]) has been suggested as an explanation, since it has been known to appear at the wingtips of aircraft.&lt;ref name=time19450115/&gt; It has also been pointed out that some of the descriptions of foo fighters closely resemble those of [[ball lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stenhoff | first = Mark | authorlink = | title = Ball Lightning: An Unsolved Problem in Atmospheric Physics | publisher = Springer | date = 1999 | location = | page = 112 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-306-46150-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During April 1945, the [[U.S. Navy]] began to experiment on visual illusions as experienced by nighttime aviators. This work began the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Medicine (BUMED) project X-148-AV-4-3. This project pioneered the study of aviators' [[vertigo]] and was initiated because a wide variety of anomalous events were being reported by nighttime aviators.&lt;ref&gt;"The Real Foo Fighters - A Historical and Physiological Perspective on a World War II Aviation Mystery" Skeptic Magazine, vol. 17, n. 2 (pp. 38-43)&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Edgar Vinacke, who was the prime flight psychologist on this project, summarized the need for a cohesive and systemic outline of the epidemiology of aviators' vertigo:
{{quote|Pilots do not have sufficient information about phenomena of disorientation, and, as a corollary, are given considerable disorganized, incomplete, and inaccurate information. They are largely dependent upon their own experience, which must supplement and interpret the traditions about "Vertigo" which are passed on to them. When a concept thus grows out of anecdotes cemented together with practical necessity, it is bound to acquire elements of mystery. So far as "vertigo" is concerned, no one really knows more than a small part of the facts, but a great deal of the peril. Since aviators are not skilled observers of human behavior, they usually have only the vaguest understanding of their own feelings. Like other naive persons, therefore, they have simply adopted a term to cover a multitude of otherwise inexplicable events.|Edgar Vinacke|The Concept of Aviator's "Vertigo"&lt;ref&gt;Vinacke, Edgar. 8 May 1946.

'''Forbon''' is a [[Vulcanized fibre|vulcanized fiber]] that was created in the early 1900s by the [[National Vulcanized Fiber|NVF]] company. It was used on the original [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]] that [[Leo Fender]] (founder of [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender Guitars]]) created for the [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]], and the [[Fender Precision Bass|Precision Bass]]. It is still used on reissue [[Electric guitar|guitar]] and [[Bass guitar|bass]] models from that era. Lollar Pickups and The [[Seymour Duncan]] Pickup Company also use Forbon on many of their pickups, such as early Fender style replacement pickups. Forbon is still sold by the NVF company.

{{Main|Electricity sector in Guyana}}

In Guyana, the areas outside of the coastal plain are referred to as hinterland. Approximately twenty percent of the Guyanan population live in the hinterland. The population mostly consists of Amerindian communities who have little access to modern energy services such as electricity, light and modern fuels for cooking and transportation. This situation contrasts with the coastal plain, where there is access to the electricity grid. Several initiatives are in place to improve energy services in the hinterland. 

== Stakeholders and involved parties ==
Many offices and organisations are active in issues relating to energy development in the hinterland, some of which are listed below:

== Projects and initiatives ==

=== Unserved Areas Electrification Programme (GoG,OPM,IDB 2004-2010) ===
The Government of Guyana (GoG) started the implementation of the [http://www.electricity.gov.gy/uaep.php?id=uaep.txt Unserved Areas Electrification Programme (UAEP)] with loan support from the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) in 2004, which had several components, including extending electric grid coverage of [http://www.gplinc.com/?q=uaep Guyana Power and Light Inc.], reducing losses, management and operational support and a Customer Information System. It also had a hinterland energy component, using [[Solar Home Systems]] (SHS) and community-based systems for schools to provide community and household access to electricity. The systems in Yarakita, Capoey, Kurukubaru and Muritaro comprised a 125W monocrystalline panel and flooded [[lead acid battery]]. The schools in these villages received 250W system with inverter, 8x25W bulbs and 120V outlets. Another 12 villages received a total of 1200 SHS with 65W panels and maintenance-free [[AGM battery]], and one 260W system for the school. Wind speed measurements were carried out in Orealla, Jawalla, Campbelletown and Yupukari, but wind power potential was found to be insufficient&lt;ref name="GEA"&gt;{{cite book|title=Energy Development in Guyana|year=2010|publisher=GEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rural Electrification Project (GEA, OLADE, CIDA 2009) ===
[[File:WowettaControl.jpg|thumb|Solar controller used in SHS]]This project was funded by CIDA, implemented jointly by the Latin American Energy Organisation [http://www.olade.org/ OLADE] and the University of Calgary-Haskayne School of Business. The Guyana Energy Agency [http://www.gea.gov.gy/ GEA] was the national supporting agency. The project focused on the village of Wowetta and it included 5 components: 49 Solar Home Systems (40W MC Kyocera panel, 92Ah Deka AGM battery, 8 Amp Steca controller, one 7W and one 15W CFL 12V lightbulb), a freezer for the village shop (SunDanzer 24V freezer, 2x130W Kyocera panels, a 15 Amp Steca controller and two 12V lightbulbs), a Lorenz submersible water pump for irrigation of vegetable garden (four 85W panels, Lorenz 200 pump controller), an electric 110V cassava mill powered by a diesel generator, and a joinery shop. A field visit in May 2011 showed that the SHS and solar freezer were working well, but the water pump was defective. In addition, due to several overcast days the freezer was temporarily emptied due to insufficient cooling.

=== Hinterland Electrification by Renewable Energy Pilot Project (UNDP/OPM 2006-2008)===
[[File:WiniarskiRocket.jpg|thumb|x90px|Efficient wood stove used in Orealla]]The purpose of this project was capacity building and demonstration of renewable energy. It was funded by UNDP and implemented by Office of Prime Minister. During this project, 3 PV systems were installed for income generation, one in Wauna to support a peanut processing business, one in Kato for a vaccine freezer and battery charging service and one in Orealla to support Fruit Cheese production. Also, efficient woodstoves were introduced in Orealla and Kato to reduce firewood consumption and respiratory illnesses from smoke inhalation. Wind measurement was carried out in Paramakatoi, but proved insufficient for wind power generation

In Kato an opportunity was identified to use small hydro-power at the Chiung River to operate a water pump for irrigation purposes, and a prefeasibility study was carried out. In 2011 the hydro-power option is pursued by OPM and under EU support to provide the school in Kato with electricity and irrigation for the nearby fields.

=== Energy Services at Community Level for MDG achievement in Hinterland area (UNDP/OPM/GEA 2010-2015) ===
[[File:LD150.jpg|thumb|x90px|Parabolic solar cooker]]The [[United Nations Development Programme]] [[UNDP]] has initiated a project on delivering energy services to hinterland areas. However, this project also targets other energy needs besides electricity, like cooking and transportation and it focuses specifically on community needs. It builds on the experiences of 2006 project and will be carried out in two phases during 2011-2012 and 2013-2015. In the first phase a needs assessment survey will be carried out in Regions 1 and 7 to identify specific energy needs and potential energy sources.

=== Solar Home Light kits (GEA, MoFA) ===
[[File:PortableSolarLight.jpg|thumb|x80px|Portable solar light kit]]
In 2009 the Guyana Energy Agency and Office of Prime Minister in collaboration with Ministry of Amerindian Affairs provided 1000 portable solar light kits to 19 Villages in Regions 1,2,7,8 and 9. The kit consists of a 15W panel, a charge control cabinet containing a 20Ah battery and three 11W CFL light bulbs.&lt;ref name="GEA" /&gt; In 2011 another 100 solar light kits were procured, with new design and LED light bulbs.

=== Hinterland Electrification Programme, 11.000 Solar Home Systems (OP/OPM/GRIF 2011) ===
In 2011  GoG will invest more on distributed PV technology when 11.000 Solar Home Systems (65W)&lt;ref name="Office of President web page"&gt;{{cite web|last=Office of President web page|title=Solar panel project moving ahead|url=http://opnew.op.gov.gy/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1203:solar-panel-project-moving-ahead--president&amp;catid=34:bulletins&amp;Itemid=70|work=Hinterland Electrification Programme|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!-- Staff reporter --&gt; |title=Cabinet approves procurement of solar home systems for hinterland electrification programme |url=http://guyanachronicle.com/2011/07/03/cabinet-approves-procurement-of-solar-home-systems-for-hinterland-electrification-programme |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Guyana Chronicle |date=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are being deployed to mostly Amerindian Hinterland and riverine communities as part of the [http://www.lcds.gov.gy/ Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS)]. The systems will be equipped with maintenance-free AGM batteries. Due to delays in accessing funding by the [http://www.lcds.gov.gy/guyana-redd-investment-fund-grif.html Guyana Redd+ Investment Fund (GRIF)] the acquired equipment will be paid from the national treasury and the Government will seek retroactive financing.&lt;ref name="Office of President web page"/&gt;

The project will also include training the communities to install and maintain their systems.

=== Eerepami Foundation Projects ===
This German foundation [http://www.eerepami.de/?main=18&amp;sub=38&amp;lang=en Eerepami Regenwaldstiftung] has carried out several renewable energy initiatives in Guyana. In Bina Hill and Shell Beach 1&amp;nbsp;kW PV systems have been installed, and the Bina Hill system will later be extended to 11&amp;nbsp;kW. In Annai and Agatash a set of 100 solar lights have been distributed. The foundation also encourages other hinterland activities and volunteering.

=== Peace Corps Capacity Building ===
After identifying the lack of knowledge on PV technology the Peace Corps has initiated efforts to provide engineering support to specific locations in the Hinterland as well as prepare training for community volunteers in 2011. Support consisted of 2 volunteers stationed in Region 1 and Region 9.

=== Mobile phone base stations in off-grid areas===
[[File:BTS Vodafone.jpg|thumb|x150px|Mobile Base Station]]Mobile operators (Digicel and GTT) are expanding their coverage to off-grid areas and thus require electricity for the base stations. As conventional diesel generators face maintenance and fuel cost issues and the price of PV equipment is declining, it is envisaged that mobile base stations will be powered by PV systems. Digicel has already installed PV power systems in the villages of Wakapau, Kwebana, Red Hill and Mathews Ridge. 58 miles and Mahdia Trail will get PV later in 2011, and Mahdia, Port Kaituma and Mabaruma in 2012. To support local communities and improve the mobile communication potential a phone charging service is provided to the communities free of charge.

=== Private installations ===
[[File:CabinWithPV.jpg|thumb|Holiday cabin using solar power]]
Several private users and tourism businesses have installed renewable energy systems in the Hinterland. PV electricity, typically using diesel backup, is in use at least at Iwokrama Field Station, Surama Ecolodge, Gamell's Back Shop (Kumaka R1),Adel's Eco-Resort, Arrow Point and Karanambu.

=== Amaila Falls Hydro Energy Power  ===
The [http://www.amailahydropower.com/ Amaila Falls Hydro Energy Plant] is not directly targeting energy needs in the Hinterland, but the plants remote location in Region 7 and the vast logistics of construction, access and transmission lines for the largest investment project in Guyana will be a significant development for the Hinterland. The designed electrical power is 165MW, which exceeds the national electricity demand. The project would offer the opportunity for Guyana to move from a nearly complete reliance on imported fuels to self-sufficiency in primary energy demand for electricity production.

=== CREDP/GIZ ===
The Caricom Renewable Energy Development Programme [http://www.credp-giz.org/ CREDP] is a joint project of CARICOM and the German International Cooperation GIZ, formerly GTZ, delivering technical expertise to renewable energy projects. CREDP seeks to remove barriers for the use of Renewable Energy and application of Energy Efficiency measures in the Caribbean Region. In Guyana, CREDP is currently providing technical support to a small hydro-power project in Kato, as well as a business in Georgetown in utilising PV.

=== SIDS DOCK ===
The  [http://aosis.info/sids-dock/ SIDS DOCK Support Programme] is a joint initiative of UNDP and the World Bank, developed in close consultation with the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). This initiative aims to support Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to transition to low-emission economies through development and deployment of renewable energy resources and promotion of greater energy efficiency. An important component is the one-stop-shop function, facilitating SIDS’s access to global financial flows, especially from the carbon market enabling them to fund transformational energy policies.
 
The programme will be implemented over a period of 18 months, from July 2011 to December 2012. At present, funding of USD 14.5 million has been mobilized from the Government of Denmark.

== PV installations ==
Photovoltaic systems can be Solar Home Systems, installations for a specific application (like a water pump or freezer) or community or mini-grids serving multiple users.

=== Photovoltaic household systems ===
[[File:Guyana regions numbered (GINA).png|thumb|Regions of Guyana]]
No public records exist on private solar home systems in use in Guyana. However, several development projects have comprising solar home system (SHS) installations or portable systems (Pico-PV) for small lights etc. have been carried out in Hinterland villages. These projects typically use a ''one size fits all'' approach to serve a large number of beneficiaries.

==Biofuels==
[[Image:Elaeis guineensis MS 3467.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Oil palm]] tree (''Elaeis guineensis'')]]
Guyana has excellent potential for biofuels utilization. The [http://www.guysuco.gy/ GuySuCo] Sugar factory in Skeldon has been modernized and a biocombustion plant has been built for producing electricity from bagasse. In recent years the [http://www.iast.gov.gy/biofuels.html Institute of Applied Science and Technology] has been investigating [http://www.iast.gov.gy/ricebiomass.html rice husk] for combustion, and vegetable oils (palm, coconut, jathropa, wastes) for biodiesel production,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Narine|first=Suresh|title=Agro-Energy Presentation|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.gy/agro-energy%20presentation/16%20Suresh%20S.%20Narine.pdf|work=Biofuels in Guyana|publisher=IAST|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with large scale palm oil based production facilities in Wauna, Region 1. Furthermore, the development of a national Agro-Energy Policy has been reported,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IAST Biofuels|url=http://www.iast.gov.gy/biofuels.html|publisher=IAST|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but information has not been updated since 2008.

==Biogas==
The GEA reports small scale biogas production at 5 sites&lt;ref name="GEA"/&gt; in Georgetown, Linden and Berbice, using mostly low-cost polyethylene-film tube digesters of plug-flow digesters. Many have been supported by IDB and the [http://www.ipedgy.com/ Institute of Private Enterprise Development]. Pay-back periods of 3–7 months have been reported. A similar digester has been built in Bina Hill, but this digester is currently not operational.

== Suppliers ==
Renewable energy equipment is available from several suppliers in Georgetown, some of which are listed below in alphabetical order:

The '''International Commission on the History of Geological Sciences''' ('''INHIGEO''') promotes ongoing research into the history of the [[earth science]]s, particularly the [[history of geology]]. It has 17 Honorary Senior Members and 265 Members and Associate Members&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxpbmhpZ2VvdGVzdHxneDoxZGVhYzMwZjMyZjMyMjQ4 INHIGEO Annual record. No. 46], May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide.

INHIGEO has been established by the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] (IUGS) and is also affiliated with the [[International Union of History and Philosophy of Science]] (IUHPS). The suggestion for the establishment of INHIGEO in 1967 was chiefly due to the ideas and efforts of the distinguished Russian geologist ''Vladimir Tikhomirov'' (1915-1994) from the Geological Institute of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]].

== Objective ==
The primary objective of the Commission on the History of Geological Sciences involves promoting studies in the history of geological disciplines. In so doing, the Commission
endeavours to stimulate and coordinate the activities of regional, national, and international organizations having shared purposes. The Commission also works to foster the publication of individual and collective works that illuminate the history of the geological sciences.

INHIGEO achieves its objective by sponsoring a major annual symposium with associated field activities. It also promotes publication of individual and collective works on the history of geology and issues a substantial "Annual Record" that details historical research into earth sciences worldwide, publicises other pertinent historical activities and provides scholarly reviews of recent literature on the subject.

== Strategies ==
* Meet with regularity, usually once a year, including years of the [[International Geological Congress]], to conduct a major symposium on the history of geology. This typically
includes a multi-day field component, with the production by the Commission of printed guidebooks.
* Produce an annual Newsletter that incorporates information from the officers, national reports, book reviews, conference reports, and a variety of news items and illustrations that
promote sharing of professional insights.
* Make an effort to record the history of the [[International Geological Congress]] meetings and relevant IUGS activities.
* Work with various publishing houses and journals, including ''Episodes'',&lt;ref&gt;Episodes - Journal of International Geosciences.&lt;/ref&gt; to promote publication of symposia proceedings and a variety of contributions to the discipline.

The International Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE) is an international collaborative initiative to accelerate the development and deployment of [[hydrogen]] and [[fuel cell]] technologies and enable the global energy security, environmental and economic benefits that these technologies can provide. The IPHE membership is open to national governmental entities that have significant commitments to invest resources into research, development and demonstration activities to advance hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.

The IPHE Terms of Reference, signed in November 2003, created a steering committee which governs the overall framework and activities of the IPHE.  The mission of the IPHE is to serve as a mechanism to share information among partners to enable the organization and  implementation of effective, efficient, and focused international research, development, demonstration and deployment activities related to hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.  The organization also provides a forum for sharing information on advancing policies as well as common codes and standards that can accelerate the cost-effective transition to hydrogen and fuel cells in a global economy to enhance energy security and environmental protection.  The four strategic priorities which guide the activities of the organization include:

# Accelerating the market penetration and early adoption of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies and their supporting infrastructure
# Supporting widespread deployment through policy and regulatory activities
# Raising the profile with policy-makers and the public
# Monitoring hydrogen, fuel cell and complementary technology developments

The two primary Working Groups within IPHE are the Education Working Group and the Regulations, Codes and Standards (RCS) Working Group.  The Education Working Group focuses on sharing best practices and ideas on methods to increase education and outreach activities, including increased recognition programs such as through student awards.  The RCS Working Group has focused on a number of activities related to sharing information on safety and protocol development related to testing hydrogen systems, including round robin testing of hydrogen tanks among several countries.  Task Forces are also created to accelerate activities in specific areas as needed, such as the Task Force on sharing information on policies and incentives that may be valuable in accelerating the commercialization of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies.

IPHE also recognizes that stakeholders, those organizations that are affected by and can affect the goals of IPHE, form an essential component of IPHE activities. As such, IPHE has organized and endorsed a number of workshops and stakeholder events aligned with its mission.

In July 2005, the G8 Summit endorsed the IPHE in its Plan of Action on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development, and identified it as a medium of cooperation and collaboration to develop  clean energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Gleneagles Plan of Action: Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development"[http://www.g8.utoronto.ca/summit/2005gleneagles/climatechangeplan.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar designations were also made in bilateral activities that include:

# the joint statement of the U.S.-European Union Summit on Energy Security, Energy Efficiency, Renewables and Economic Development,&lt;ref&gt;U.S.-European Union Summit on Energy Security, Energy Efficiency, Renewables and Economic Development"[http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/us/sum04_07/joint_statement_energy_security.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
# the Mainz Declaration of Germany and the United States on Cleaner and More Efficient Energy, Development and Climate Change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://germany.usembassy.gov/germany/statement_climate.html Mainz Declaration"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128111613/http://germany.usembassy.gov/germany/statement_climate.html |date=2008-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note: When formed in 2003, the IPHE stood for the "International Partnership for the Hydrogen Economy".  The name was changed in 2009 in order to ensure the inclusion of fuel cell technologies within the scope of the partnership.

{{History of Italy}}

The '''Italian Renaissance''' ({{lang-it|Rinascimento}} {{IPA-it|rinaʃʃiˈmento|}}) was a period of [[European history]] that began in [[Italy]] in the 14th century ([[Trecento]]) and lasted until the 17th century ([[Seicento]]), marking the transition from the [[Middle Ages]] to [[Modernity]]. The French word ''renaissance'' (''Rinascimento'' in Italian) means "Rebirth" and defines the period as one of cultural revival and renewed interest in [[classical antiquity]] after the centuries labeled the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] by [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]]. The Renaissance author [[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term "Rebirth" in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' but the concept became widespread only in the 19th century, after the works of scholars such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Jacob Burckhardt]].

The European Renaissance began in [[Tuscany]] ([[Central Italy]]), and was centred in the city of [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke, P., ''The European Renaissance: Centre and Peripheries'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Florence, one of the several [[city-states]] of the peninsula, rose to economic prominence by providing credit for European monarchs and laying down the groundwork for [[capitalism]] and [[banking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sée|first=Henri|title=Modern Capitalism Its Origin and Evolution|url=http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|work=University of Rennes|publisher=Batoche Books|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007010542/http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/see/ModernCapitalism.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Renaissance later spread to [[Venice]], heart of a [[Venetian Empire|mediterranean empire]] and in control of the trade routes with the east since the participation in the [[crusades]] and the voyages of [[Marco Polo]], where the remains of [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek culture]] were brought together and provided [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars with new texts. Finally the Renaissance had a significant effect on the [[Papal States]] and [[Rome]], largely rebuilt by Humanist and [[Renaissance pope]]s (such as [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]), who were frequently involved in [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Italian politics]], in [[Treaty of Tordesillas|arbitrating disputes]] between competing colonial powers and in [[Counter-Reformation|opposing]] the [[Reformation]].

The Italian Renaissance is best known for its achievements in [[Italian Renaissance painting|painting]], [[Italian Renaissance architecture|architecture]], [[Italian Renaissance sculpture|sculpture]], [[Italian Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]] and [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]]. Italy became the recognized European leader in all these areas by the late 15th century, during the [[Peace of Lodi]] (1454-1494) agreed between Italian states. The Italian Renaissance peaked in the mid-16th century as domestic disputes and foreign invasions plunged the region into the turmoil of the [[Italian Wars]] (1494-1559). However, the ideas and ideals of the Italian Renaissance endured and spread into the rest of Europe, setting off the [[Northern Renaissance]]. Italian explorers from the [[maritime republics]] served under the auspices of European monarchs, ushering the Age of discovery. The most famous among them are [[Christopher Columbus]] who served for Spain, [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] for France, [[Amerigo Vespucci]] for Portugal, and [[John Cabot]] for England. Italian universities attracted [[polymaths]] and scholars such as [[Copernicus]], [[Vesalius]], [[Galileo]] and [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]], playing a key role in the [[scientific revolution]]. Various events and dates of the 17th century, such as the conclusion of the [[European Wars of Religion]] in 1648, have been proposed for the end of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=SvYACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT62&amp;dq=peace+of+westphalia+marks+the+end+of+the+Renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA3ICuifLVAhXKCsAKHRbbBCgQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=peace%20of%20westphalia%20marks%20the%20end%20of%20the%20Renaissance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of [[Renaissance literature]] usually begin with the three great poets of the 14th century: [[Dante Alighieri]] (''[[Divine Comedy]]''), [[Petrarch]] (''[[Canzoniere]]'') and [[Boccaccio]] (''[[Decameron]]''). Famous vernacular poets of the Renaissance include the renaissance epic authors [[Luigi Pulci]] (author of ''[[Morgante]]''), [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]] (''[[Orlando Innamorato]]''), [[Ludovico Ariosto]] (''[[Orlando Furioso]]'') and [[Torquato Tasso]] (''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]''). 15th-century writers such as the poet [[Poliziano]] and the Platonist philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] made extensive translations from both Latin and Greek. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione|Castiglione]] laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady in ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', while [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on "''la verità effettuale della cosa''"—the actual truth of things—in ''[[The Prince]]'', composed, in humanistic style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virtù]]. Historians of the period include Machiavelli himself, his friend and critic [[Francesco Guicciardini]] and [[Giovanni Botero]] (''[[The Reason of State]]''). The Aldine Press, founded by the printer [[Aldo Manuzio]], active in Venice, developed [[Italic type]] and portable printed books that could be carried in one's pocket, as well as being the first to publish editions of books in Ancient Greek. Venice also became the birthplace of the [[Commedia dell'Arte]].

[[Italian Renaissance art]] exercised a dominant influence on subsequent European painting and sculpture for centuries afterwards, with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Donatello]], [[Giotto di Bondone]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], [[Perugino]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Titian]]. The same is true for [[Renaissance architecture|architecture]], as practiced by [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Andrea Palladio]], and [[Bramante]]. Their works include, to name only a few, the [[Florence Cathedral]], [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, and the [[Tempio Malatestiano]] in Rimini, as well as [[Renaissance architecture|several private residences]]. The musical era of the Italian Renaissance was defined by the [[Roman School]] and later by the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]] and the birth of [[Opera]] in Florence. In [[Modern philosophy#Modern Western philosophy|philosophy]], thinkers such as Galileo, Machiavelli, [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Pico della Mirandola]], emphasized [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and [[humanism]], thus rejecting dogma and [[scholasticism]].

==Origins and background==
===Northern and Central Italy in the Late Middle Ages===
By the [[Late Middle Ages]] (circa 1300 onward), [[Latium]], the former heartland of the [[Roman Empire]], and [[southern Italy]] were generally poorer than the North. [[Rome]] was a city of ancient ruins, and the [[Papal States]] were loosely administered, and vulnerable to external interference such as that of France, and later Spain. The Papacy was affronted when the [[Avignon Papacy]] was created in southern France as a consequence of pressure from [[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair]] of France. In the south, [[Sicily]] had for some time been under foreign domination, [[History of Islam in southern Italy|by the Arabs]] and [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|then the Normans]]. Sicily had prospered for 150 years during the [[Emirate of Sicily]] and later for two centuries during the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman Kingdom]] and the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Hohenstaufen Kingdom]], but had declined by the late Middle Ages.

In contrast, Northern and Central Italy had become far more prosperous, and it has been calculated that the region was among the richest of [[Europe]]. The [[Crusades]] had built lasting trade links to the [[Levant]], and the [[Fourth Crusade]] had done much to destroy the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Roman Empire]] as a commercial rival to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. The main trade routes from the east passed through the Byzantine Empire or the [[Arab World|Arab lands]] and onward to the ports of [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], and [[Venice]]. Luxury goods bought in the Levant, such as spices, dyes, and silks were imported to Italy and then resold throughout Europe. Moreover, the inland [[city-state]]s profited from the rich agricultural land of the [[Po River|Po]] valley. From France, Germany, and the Low Countries, through the medium of the [[Champagne fairs]], land and river trade routes brought goods such as [[wool]], [[wheat]], and [[precious metal]]s into the region. The extensive trade that stretched from [[Egypt]] to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] generated substantial surpluses that allowed significant investment in mining and agriculture. Thus, while northern Italy was not richer in resources than many other parts of Europe, the level of development, stimulated by trade, allowed it to prosper. In particular, Florence became one of the wealthiest of the cities of Northern Italy,  mainly due to its woolen textile production, developed under the supervision of its dominant trade [[guild]], the ''[[Arte della Lana]]''. Wool was imported from Northern Europe (and in the 16th century from Spain)&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and together with [[dye]]s from the east were used to make high quality textiles.

The Italian trade routes that covered the Mediterranean and beyond were also major conduits of culture and knowledge. The
[[Transmission of the Classics|recovery of lost Greek classics]] (and, to a lesser extent, Arab advancements on them) following the [[Fourth Crusade|Crusader]] [[Siege of Constantinople|conquest of the Byzantine heartlands]], revitalized [[medieval philosophy]] in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], just as the [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|refugee Byzantine scholars]] who migrated to Italy during and following the Turkish conquest of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] between the 12th and 15th centuries were important in sparking the new linguistic studies of the Renaissance, in newly created [[Academy|academies]] in Florence and Venice. Humanist scholars searched monastic libraries for ancient manuscripts and recovered [[Tacitus]] and other Latin authors. The rediscovery of [[Vitruvius]] meant that the architectural principles of Antiquity could be observed once more, and Renaissance artists were encouraged, in the atmosphere of humanist optimism, to excel the achievements of the Ancients, like [[Apelles]], of whom they read.

===Thirteenth-century===
In the 13th century, much of Europe experienced strong economic growth. The trade routes of the Italian states linked with those of established Mediterranean ports and eventually the [[Hanseatic League]] of the Baltic and northern regions of Europe to create a network economy in Europe for the first time since the 4th century. The  [[Italian city-states|city-states of Italy]] expanded greatly during this period and grew in power to become de facto fully independent of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; apart from the [[Kingdom of Naples]], outside powers kept their armies out of Italy. During this period, the modern commercial infrastructure developed, with [[double-entry book-keeping]], [[joint stock companies]], an international [[banking]] system, a systematized [[foreign exchange market]], [[insurance]], and [[government debt]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Florence became the centre of this financial industry and the gold [[Italian coin florin|florin]] became the main currency of international trade.

The new mercantile governing class, who gained their position through financial skill, adapted to their purposes the [[feudal]] aristocratic model that had dominated Europe in the Middle Ages. A feature of the High Middle Ages in Northern Italy was the rise of the [[Medieval commune|urban communes]] which had broken from the control by bishops and local counts. In much of the region, the [[landed nobility]] was poorer than the urban patriarchs in the High Medieval money economy whose inflationary rise left land-holding aristocrats impoverished. The increase in trade during the early Renaissance enhanced these characteristics. The decline of feudalism and the rise of cities influenced each other; for example, the demand for luxury goods led to an increase in trade, which led to greater numbers of tradesmen becoming wealthy, who, in turn, demanded more luxury goods. This atmosphere of assumed luxury of the time created a need for the creation of visual symbols of wealth, an important way to show a family’s affluence and taste.

This change also gave the merchants almost complete control of the governments of the Italian city-states, again enhancing trade. One of the most important effects of this political control was security. Those that grew extremely wealthy in a feudal state ran constant risk of running afoul of the monarchy and having their lands confiscated, as famously occurred to [[Jacques Coeur]] in France. The northern states also kept many medieval laws that severely hampered commerce, such as those against [[usury]], and prohibitions on trading with non-Christians. In the city-states of Italy, these laws were repealed or rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourteenth-century collapse===
The 14th century saw a series of catastrophes that caused the European economy to go into recession. The [[Medieval Warm Period]] was ending as the transition to the [[Little Ice Age]] began.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 97; see also Andrew B. Appleby's "Epidemics and Famine in the Little Ice Age." ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History.'' Vol. 10 No. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in climate saw agricultural output decline significantly, leading to repeated [[famine]]s, exacerbated by the rapid population growth of the earlier era. The [[Hundred Years' War]] between England and France disrupted trade throughout northwest Europe, most notably when, in 1345, King [[Edward III of England]] repudiated his debts, contributing to the collapse of the two largest Florentine banks, those of the [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]]. In the east, war was also disrupting trade routes, as the [[Ottoman Empire]] began to expand throughout the region. Most devastating, though, was the [[Black Death]] that decimated the populations of the densely populated cities of Northern Italy and returned at intervals thereafter. Florence, for instance, which had a pre-plague population of 45,000 decreased over the next 47 years by 25–50%.&lt;ref&gt;Olea, Ricardo A, Christakos, George, [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 "Duration of Urban Mortality for the 14th-Century Black Death Epidemic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206150835/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_200506/ai_n15845444/pg_4 |date=2008-12-06 }}, ''Human Biology'',  Jun 2005. The population level of Florence is controversial see also Ziegler (1969, pp. 51-52), Chandler 1987, pp. 16-18, and Gottfried 1983, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread disorder followed, including a revolt of Florentine textile workers, the ''[[ciompi]]'', in 1378.

It was during this period of instability that the Renaissance authors such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Petrarch]] lived, and the first stirrings of Renaissance art were to be seen, notably in the realism of [[Giotto]]. Paradoxically, some of these disasters would help establish the Renaissance. The [[Black Death]] wiped out a third of Europe's population. The resulting labour shortage increased wages and the reduced population was therefore much wealthier, better fed, and, significantly, had more surplus money to spend on luxury goods.  As incidences of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] began to decline in the early 15th century, Europe's devastated population once again began to grow.  The new demand for products and services also helped create a growing class of [[bankers]], merchants, and skilled [[artisan]]s.  The horrors of the Black Death and the seeming inability of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] to provide relief would contribute to a decline of church influence. Additionally, the collapse of the [[Compagnia dei Bardi|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi Bank|Peruzzi]] banks would open the way for the [[Medici]] to rise to prominence in Florence. [[Roberto Sabatino Lopez]] argues that the economic collapse was a crucial cause of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Robert Sabatino. "Hard Times and Investment in Culture."&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, in a more prosperous era, businessmen would have quickly reinvested their earnings in order to make more money in a climate favourable to investment. However, in the leaner years of the 14th century, the wealthy found few promising investment opportunities for their earnings and instead chose to spend more on culture and art.

Another popular explanation for the Italian Renaissance is the thesis, first advanced by historian [[Hans Baron]],&lt;ref&gt;Baron, Hans. "The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance". Princeton University Press, March 1, 1966. {{ISBN|0-691-00752-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that states that the primary impetus of the early Renaissance was the long-running series of [[Italian Wars|wars]] between Florence and Milan. By the late 14th century, Milan had become a centralized monarchy under the control of the [[house of Visconti|Visconti]] family. [[Giangaleazzo Visconti]], who ruled the city from 1378 to 1402, was renowned both for his cruelty and for his abilities, and set about building an empire in Northern Italy. He launched a long series of wars, with Milan steadily conquering neighbouring states and defeating the various coalitions led by Florence that sought in vain to halt the advance. This culminated in the 1402 siege of Florence, when it looked as though the city was doomed to fall, before Giangaleazzo suddenly died and his empire collapsed.

Baron's thesis suggests that during these long wars, the leading figures of Florence rallied the people by presenting the war as one between the free republic and a despotic monarchy, between the ideals of the Greek and Roman Republics and those of the Roman Empire and Medieval kingdoms. For Baron, the most important figure in crafting this ideology was [[Leonardo Bruni]]. This time of crisis in Florence was the period when the most influential figures of the early Renaissance were coming of age, such as [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], [[Donatello]], [[Masolino]], and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]. Inculcated with this republican ideology they later went on to advocate republican ideas that were to have an enormous impact on the Renaissance.

{{Main|Italian Wars}}
[[File:Piero, ritratto di sigismondo malatesta.jpg|thumb|[[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] (1417–1468), lord of [[Rimini]], by [[Piero della Francesca]]. Malatesta was a capable ''[[condottiere]]'', following the tradition of his family. He was hired by the [[Venice|Venetians]] to fight against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] (unsuccessfully) in 1465, and was patron of [[Leone Battista Alberti]], whose ''[[Tempio Malatestiano]]'' at Rimini is one of the first entirely classical buildings of the Renaissance.]]
Northern Italy and upper Central Italy were divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the most powerful being [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Siena]], [[Genoa]], [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]], [[Verona]] and [[Venice]].  High Medieval Northern Italy was further divided by the long-running battle for supremacy between the forces of the Papacy and of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: each city aligned itself with one faction or the other, yet was divided internally between the two warring parties, [[Guelf]]s and [[Ghibelline]]s.  Warfare between the states was common, invasion from outside Italy confined to intermittent sorties of [[Holy Roman Emperors]]. Renaissance politics developed from this background. Since the 13th century, as armies became primarily composed of [[mercenaries]], prosperous city-states could field considerable forces, despite their low populations. In the course of the 15th century, the most powerful city-states annexed their smaller neighbors. Florence took [[Pisa]] in 1406, Venice captured [[Padua]] and [[Verona]], while the [[Duchy of Milan]] annexed a number of nearby areas including [[Pavia]] and [[Parma]].

The first part of the Renaissance saw almost constant warfare on land and sea as the city-states vied for preeminence.  On land, these wars were primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, but especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.  The mercenaries were not willing to risk their lives unduly, and war became one largely of sieges and maneuvering, occasioning few pitched battles. It was also in the interest of mercenaries on both sides to prolong any conflict, to continue their employment.  Mercenaries were also a constant threat to their employers; if not paid, they often turned on their patron.  If it became obvious that a state was entirely dependent on mercenaries, the temptation was great for the mercenaries to take over the running of it themselves—this occurred on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

At sea, Italian city-states sent many fleets out to do battle. The main contenders were Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, but after a long conflict the Genoese succeeded in reducing Pisa.  Venice proved to be a more powerful adversary, and with the decline of Genoese power during the 15th century Venice became pre-eminent on the seas. In response to threats from the landward side, from the early 15th century Venice developed an increased interest in controlling the ''terrafirma'' as the Venetian Renaissance opened.

On land, decades of fighting saw Florence, Milan and Venice emerge as the dominant players, and these three powers finally set aside their differences and agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries.  This peace would hold for the next forty years, and Venice's unquestioned hegemony over the sea also led to unprecedented peace for much of the rest of the 15th century. In the beginning of the 15th century, adventurer and traders such as [[Niccolò Da Conti]] (1395–1469) traveled as far as [[Southeast Asia]] and back, bringing fresh knowledge on the state of the world, presaging further European voyages of exploration in the years to come.

===Florence under the Medici===
{{Main|House of Medici}}
Until the late 14th century, prior to the Medici, Florence's leading family were the [[House of Albizzi]]. In 1293 the Ordinances of Justice were enacted which effectively became the constitution of the republic of Florence throughout the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Bartlett, ''The Italian Renaissance'', Chapter 7, p.37, Volume II, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The city's numerous luxurious [[Palace#Italy|palazzi]] were becoming surrounded by [[townhouses]], built by the ever prospering merchant class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutflorence.com/history-of-Florence.html |title=History of Florence |publisher=Aboutflorence.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1298, one of the leading banking families of Europe, the Bonsignoris, were bankrupted and so the city of Siena lost her status as the banking center of Europe to Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, p 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The main challengers of the Albizzi family were the [[Medici]]s, first under [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], later under his son [[Cosimo de' Medici|Cosimo di Giovanni de' Medici]]. The Medici controlled the [[Medici bank]]—then Europe's largest bank—and an array of other enterprises in Florence and elsewhere. In 1433, the Albizzi managed to have Cosimo exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, Roger J. ''Severing the Neck of Pride: Donatello's "Judith and Holofernes" and the Recollection of Albizzi Shame in Medicean Florence ''. Artibus et Historiae, Volume 22, Edit 44, 2001. pp. 23-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, however, saw a pro-Medici [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] elected and Cosimo returned. The Medici became the town's leading family, a position they would hold for the next three centuries. Florence remained a republic until 1537, traditionally marking the end of the High Renaissance in Florence, but the instruments of republican government were firmly under the control of the Medici and their allies, save during the intervals after 1494 and 1527. Cosimo and Lorenzo rarely held official posts, but were the unquestioned leaders.

Cosimo de' Medici was highly popular among the citizenry, mainly for bringing an era of stability and prosperity to the town. One of his most important accomplishments was negotiating the [[Peace of Lodi]] with [[Francesco Sforza]] ending the decades of war with Milan and bringing stability to much of Northern Italy. Cosimo was also an important patron of the arts, directly and indirectly, by the influential example he set.

Cosimo was succeeded by his sickly son [[Piero di Cosimo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]], who died after five years in charge of the city. In 1469 the reins of power passed to Cosimo's twenty-one-year-old grandson [[Lorenzo de' Medici|Lorenzo]], who would become known as "Lorenzo the Magnificent." Lorenzo was the first of the family to be educated from an early age in the humanist tradition and is best known as one of the Renaissance's most important patrons of the arts. Under Lorenzo, the Medici rule was formalized with the creation of a new [[Council of Seventy]], which Lorenzo headed. The republican institutions continued, but they lost all power. Lorenzo was less successful than his illustrious forebears in business, and the Medici commercial empire was slowly eroded. Lorenzo continued the alliance with Milan, but relations with the papacy soured, and in 1478, Papal agents allied with the [[Pazzi]] family in an attempt to assassinate Lorenzo. Although the plot failed, Lorenzo's young brother, [[Giuliano di Piero de' Medici|Giuliano]], was killed, and the failed assassination led to a war with the Papacy and was used as justification to further centralize power in Lorenzo's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florentine-society.ru/Medici_Chapel_Mysteries.htm Peter Barenboim, Sergey Shiyan, ''Michelangelo: Mysteries of Medici Chapel'', SLOVO, Moscow, 2006]. {{ISBN|5-85050-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spread===
Renaissance ideals first spread from Florence to the neighbouring states of [[Tuscany]] such as [[Siena]] and [[Lucca]]. The Tuscan culture soon became the model for all the states of Northern Italy, and the Tuscan variety of Italian came to predominate throughout the region, especially in literature. In 1447 [[Francesco Sforza]] came to power in [[Milan]] and rapidly transformed that still medieval city into a major centre of art and learning that drew [[Leone Battista Alberti]]. [[Venice]], one of the wealthiest cities due to its control of the Adriatic Sea, also became a centre for Renaissance culture, especially architecture. Smaller courts brought Renaissance patronage to lesser cities, which developed their characteristic arts: [[Ferrara]], [[Mantua]] under the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]], and [[Urbino]] under [[Federico da Montefeltro]]. In [[Naples]], the Renaissance was ushered in under the patronage of [[Alfonso V of Aragon|Alfonso I]] who conquered Naples in 1443 and encouraged artists like [[Francesco Laurana]] and [[Antonello da Messina]] and writers like the poet [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] and the humanist scholar [[Angelo Poliziano]].

In 1417 the Papacy returned to Rome, but that once imperial city remained poor and largely in ruins through the first years of the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="rome"&gt;Burke 1999, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; The great transformation began under [[Pope Nicholas V]], who became pontiff in 1447.  He launched a dramatic rebuilding effort that would eventually see much of the city renewed.  The humanist scholar Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini became [[Pope Pius II]] in 1458. As the papacy fell under the control of the wealthy families, such as the [[Medici]] and the [[Borgia]]s&lt;!--Valencia!--&gt; the spirit of Renaissance art and philosophy came to dominate the Vatican.  [[Pope Sixtus IV]] continued Nicholas' work, most famously ordering the construction of the [[Sistine Chapel]].  The popes also became increasingly secular rulers as the [[Papal States]] were forged into a centralized power by a series of "warrior popes".

The nature of the Renaissance also changed in the late 15th century.  The Renaissance ideal was fully adopted by the ruling classes and the aristocracy.  In the early Renaissance artists were seen as craftsmen with little prestige or recognition.  By the later Renaissance the top figures wielded great influence and could charge great fees.  A flourishing trade in Renaissance art developed.  While in the early Renaissance many of the leading artists were of lower- or middle-class origins, increasingly they became aristocrats.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

===Wider population===
As a cultural movement, the Italian Renaissance affected only a small part of the population. Italy was the most urbanized region of Europe, but three quarters of the people were still rural peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; For this section of the population, life remained essentially unchanged from the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic [[feudalism]] had never been prominent in Northern Italy, and most peasants worked on private farms or as [[sharecropper]]s.  Some scholars see a trend towards [[refeudalization]] in the later Renaissance as the urban elites turned themselves into landed aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation differed in the  cities. These were dominated by a commercial elite; as exclusive as the aristocracy of any Medieval kingdom.  This group became the main patrons of and audience for Renaissance culture.  Below them there was a large class of artisans and guild members who lived comfortable lives and had significant power in the republican governments.  This was in sharp contrast to the rest of Europe where artisans were firmly in the lower class.  Literate and educated, this group did participate in the Renaissance culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1992, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest section of the urban population was the urban poor of semi-skilled workers and the unemployed.  Like the peasants, the Renaissance had little effect on them. Historians debate how easy it was to move between these groups during the Italian Renaissance. Examples of individuals who rose from humble beginnings can be instanced, but Burke notes two major studies in this area that have found that the data do not clearly demonstrate an increase in [[social mobility]]. Most historians feel that early in the Renaissance social mobility was quite high, but that it faded over the course of the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Burke 1999, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality in society was very high.  An upper-class figure would control hundreds of times more income than a servant or labourer.  Some historians see this unequal distribution of wealth as important to the Renaissance, as art patronage relies on the very wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pullan |first1=Brian S. |title=History of early Renaissance Italy:From the mid-thirteenth to the mid-fifteenth century |year=1973 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |isbn=0-7139-0304-X |oclc=613989155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renaissance was not a period of great social or economic change, only of cultural and ideological development.  It only touched a small fraction of the population, and in modern times this has led many historians, such as any that follow [[historical materialism]], to reduce the importance of the Renaissance in human history. These historians tend to think in terms of "[[Early Modern Europe]]" instead. Roger Osborne&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "The Renaissance is a difficult concept for historians because the history of Europe quite suddenly turns into a history of Italian painting, sculpture and architecture."

{{Details|Northern Renaissance}}
[[File:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|[[Giulio Clovio]], ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' and ''[[Solomon]] Adored by the [[Queen of Sheba]]'' from the ''Farnese Hours,'' 1546]]
The end of the Renaissance is as imprecisely marked as its starting point.  For many, the rise to power in Florence of the austere monk [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in 1494-1498 marks the end of the city's flourishing; for others, the triumphant return of the Medici family to power in 1512 marks the beginning of the late phase in the Renaissance arts called [[Mannerism]].  Other accounts trace the end of the Italian Renaissance to the French invasions of the early 16th century and the subsequent conflict between France and Spanish rulers for control of Italian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Roger, Civilization: A New History of the Western World Pegasus, NY, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Savonarola rode to power on a widespread backlash over the secularism and indulgence of the Renaissance –&lt;ref&gt;Cast, David. "Review: Fra Girolamo Savonarola: Florentine Art and Renaissance Historiography by Ronald M. Steinberg". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 61, No. 1, March 1979. pp. 134-136.&lt;/ref&gt; his brief rule saw many works of art destroyed in the "[[Bonfire of the Vanities]]" in the centre of Florence.  With the Medici returned to power, now as [[Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], the counter movement in the church continued.  In 1542 the [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] was formed and a few years later the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' banned a wide array of Renaissance works of literature, which marks the end of the [[illuminated manuscript]] together with [[Giulio Clovio]], who is considered the greatest illuminator of the Italian High Renaissance, and arguably the last very notable artist in the long tradition of the illuminated manuscript, before some modern revivals.

Equally important was the end of stability with a series of foreign invasions of Italy known as the [[Italian Wars]] that would continue for several decades.  These began with the 1494 invasion by France that wreaked widespread devastation on Northern Italy and ended the independence of many of the city-states.  Most damaging was the May 6, 1527, Spanish and German troops' [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacking Rome]] that for two decades all but ended the role of the Papacy as the largest patron of Renaissance art and architecture.&lt;ref name="rome"/&gt;

While the Italian Renaissance was fading, the Northern Renaissance adopted many of its ideals and transformed its styles. A number of Italy's greatest artists chose to emigrate.  The most notable example was [[Leonardo da Vinci]] who left for France in 1516, but teams of lesser artists invited to transform the [[Château de Fontainebleau]] created the [[school of Fontainebleau]] that infused the style of the Italian Renaissance in France. From Fontainebleau, the new styles, transformed by [[Mannerism]], brought the Renaissance to [[Antwerp]] and thence throughout Northern Europe.

This spread north was also representative of a larger trend.  No longer was the Mediterranean Europe's most important trade route.  In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India, and from that date the primary route of goods from the Orient was through the Atlantic ports of Lisbon, Seville, Nantes, Bristol, and London.

===Literature and poetry===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance literature}}
The thirteenth-century Italian literary revolution helped set the stage for the Renaissance. Prior to the Renaissance, the [[Italian language]] was not the [[literary language]] in Italy.  It was only in the 13th century that Italian authors began writing in their native language rather than [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], or [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]].  The 1250s saw a major change in Italian poetry as the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'' (''Sweet New Style'', which emphasized [[Platonic love|Platonic]] rather than [[courtly love]]) came into its own, pioneered by poets like [[Guittone d'Arezzo]] and [[Guido Guinizelli]].  Especially in [[poetry]], major changes in [[Italian literature]] had been taking place decades before the Renaissance truly began.
[[File:Santi di Tito - Niccolo Machiavelli's portrait headcrop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]] (1469–1527), the author of ''[[The Prince]]'' and prototypical [[Polymath|Renaissance man]]. Detail from a portrait by [[Santi di Tito]].]]
With the printing of books initiated in Venice by [[Aldus Manutius]], an increasing number of works began to be published in the Italian language in addition to the flood of Latin and Greek texts that constituted the mainstream of the Italian Renaissance.  The source for these works expanded beyond works of [[theology]] and towards the pre-Christian eras of [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]].  This is not to say that no religious works were published in this period:  [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' reflects a distinctly medieval world view.  [[Christianity]] remained a major influence for artists and authors, with the [[classics]] coming into their own as a second primary influence.

In the early Italian Renaissance, much of the focus was on translating and studying classic works from Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Renaissance authors were not content to rest on the laurels of ancient authors, however.  Many authors attempted to integrate the methods and styles of the ancient Greeks into their own works.  Among the most emulated Romans are [[Cicero]], [[Horace]], [[Sallust]], and [[Virgil]].  Among the Greeks, [[Aristotle]], [[Homer]], and [[Plato]] were now being read in the original for the first time since the 4th century, though Greek compositions were few.

The literature and poetry of the Renaissance was largely influenced by the developing science and philosophy.  The humanist [[Francesco Petrarch]], a key figure in the renewed sense of scholarship, was also an accomplished poet, publishing several important works of poetry.  He wrote poetry in [[Latin]], notably the [[Punic War]] epic ''[[Africa (epic poem)|Africa]]'', but is today remembered for his works in the Italian [[vernacular]], especially the ''[[Canzoniere]]'', a collection of love [[sonnet]]s dedicated to his unrequited love Laura.  He was the foremost writer of [[sonnet]]s in Italian, and translations of his work into English by [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Thomas Wyatt]] established the sonnet form in that country, where it was employed by [[William Shakespeare]] and countless other poets.

Petrarch's disciple, [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], became a major author in his own right.  His major work was the ''[[Decameron]]'', a collection of 100 stories told by ten storytellers who have fled to the outskirts of Florence to escape the [[black plague]] over ten nights.  The ''[[Decameron]]'' in particular and Boccaccio's work in general were a major source of inspiration and plots for many English authors in the Renaissance, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare]].

Aside from Christianity, [[classical antiquity]], and scholarship, a fourth influence on Renaissance literature was politics. The political philosopher [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s most famous works are ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'', ''[[Florentine Histories]]'' and finally ''[[The Prince]]'', which has become so well known in Western society that the term "Machiavellian" has come to refer to the ''[[realpolitik]]'' advocated by the book. However, what is ordinarily called "Machiavellianism" is a simplified textbook view of this single work rather than an accurate term for his philosophy. Further, it is not at all clear that Machiavelli himself was the apologist for immorality as whom he is often portrayed: the basic problem is the apparent contradiction between the monarchism of ''The Prince'' and the republicanism of the ''Discourses''. Regardless, along with many other Renaissance works, ''The Prince'' remains a relevant and influential work of literature today.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}
[[File:Petrarch by Bargilla.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Petrarch]], from the ''Cycle of Famous Men and Women.'' ca. 1450.  Detached fresco.  {{convert|247|x|153|cm|2|abbr=on}}. Galleria degli [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  Artist: [[Andrea di Bartolo di Bargilla]] (ca. 1423–1457).]]
One role of [[Petrarch]] is as the founder of a new method of scholarship,  Renaissance Humanism.

Petrarch encouraged the study of the [[Latin]] classics and carried his copy of Homer about, at a loss to find someone to teach him to read Greek. An essential step in the humanist education being propounded by scholars like [[Pico della Mirandola]] was the hunting down of lost or forgotten manuscripts that were known only by reputation.  These endeavors were greatly aided by the wealth of Italian patricians, merchant-princes and despots, who would spend substantial sums building [[libraries]].  Discovering the past had become fashionable and it was a passionate affair pervading the upper reaches of society.  ''I go'', said [[Cyriac of Ancona]], ''I go to awake the dead''. As the Greek works were acquired, manuscripts found, libraries and [[museum]]s formed, the age of the [[printing press]] was dawning.  The works of Antiquity were translated from Greek and Latin into the contemporary modern languages throughout Europe, finding a receptive middle-class audience, which might be, like Shakespeare, "with little Latin and less Greek".

While concern for [[philosophy]], art and literature all increased greatly in the Renaissance the period is usually seen as one of scientific backwardness.  The reverence for classical sources further enshrined the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] views of the universe. Humanism stressed that nature came to be viewed as an animate spiritual creation that was not governed by laws or mathematics.  At the same time philosophy lost much of its rigour as the rules of [[logic]] and deduction were seen as secondary to intuition and emotion.

===Science===
{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance}}
According to some recent scholarship, the 'father of modern science' is [[Leonardo da Vinci]] whose experiments and clear scientific method earn him this title, Italian universities such as Padua, Bologna and Pisa were scientific centres of renown and with many northern European students, the science of the Renaissance moved to Northern Europe and flourished there, with such figures as [[Copernicus]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Descartes]].   [[Galileo]], a contemporary of Bacon and Descartes, made an immense contribution to scientific thought and experimentation, paving the way for the scientific revolution that later flourished in Northern Europe.
Bodies were also stolen from gallows and examined by many like Vesalius, a professor of anatomy. This allowed them to create accurate skeleton models and correct previously believed theories. For example, many thought that the [[human]] [[Mandible|jawbone]] was made up of two bones, as they had seen this on [[animals]]. However through examining human corpses they were able to understand that humans actually have only one.

===Sculpture and painting===
{{Main|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Last judgement.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgment]]'', 1536-1541, by [[Michelangelo]]]]
In painting, the false dawn of [[Giotto]]'s [[Trecento]] realism, his fully three-dimensional figures occupying a rational space, and his humanist interest in expressing the individual personality rather than the iconic images,&lt;ref&gt;Hayden B. J. Maginnis, ''Painting in the Age of Giotto: A Historical Reevaluation'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was followed by a retreat into conservative late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Ethan Matt Kavaler, "Renaissance Gothic: Pictures of Geometry and Narratives of Ornament," ''Art History,'' Feb 2006, Vol. 29 Issue 1, pp 1-46&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Renaissance in painting began anew, in Florence and Tuscany, with the frescoes of [[Masaccio]], then the [[panel painting]]s and [[fresco]]s of [[Piero della Francesca]] and [[Paolo Uccello]] which began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], thus representing three [[dimension]]s in two-dimensional art more authentically. The figures in Masaccio's frescos painted between 1425 and his death in 1428 have a plasticity unknown up to that point in time.  Compared to the flatness of Gothic painting, his pictures were revolutionary.  Piero della Francesca wrote treatises on scientific perspective. The creation of credible space allowed artists to also focus on the accurate representation of the human body and on naturalistic landscapes.  Completed in 1460, the [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] of [[Andrea Mantegna]], was probably the first good example of Renaissance painting in Northern Italy and became a model for other painters in the region.  At the turn of the 16th century, especially in Northern Italy, artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of [[Titian]]'s portraits and the development of [[sfumato]] and [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Giorgione]].  The period also saw the first secular (non-[[religion|religious]]) themes.  There has been much debate as to the degree of [[secularism]] in the Renaissance, which had been emphasized by early 20th-century writers like Jacob Burckhardt, based on, among other things, the presence of  a relatively small number of mythological paintings.  Those of [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], notably ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', are now among the best known, although he was deeply religious (becoming a follower of Savonarola) and the great majority of his output was of traditional religious paintings or portraits.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"&gt;Frederick Hartt,  and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In sculpture, [[Donatello]]'s (1386–1466)  study of classical sculpture led to his development of classicizing positions (such as the [[contrapposto]] pose) and subject matter (like the unsupported nude – his second sculpture of ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire.)  The progress made by Donatello was influential on all who followed; perhaps the greatest of whom is [[Michelangelo]], whose [[Michelangelo's David|''David'']] of 1500 is also a male nude study;   more naturalistic than Donatello's and with greater emotional intensity. Both sculptures are standing in ''contrapposto'', their weight shifted to one leg.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Blake McHam, ed. ''Looking at Italian Renaissance Sculpture'' (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

The period known as the High Renaissance of painting was the culmination of the varied means of expression&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Wundrum "Renaissance and Mannerism" in ''Masterpieces of Western Art'', Tashen, 2007. Page 147&lt;/ref&gt; and various advances in painting technique, such as linear perspective,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Raunch "Painting of the High Renaissance and Mannerism in Rome and Central Italy" in ''The Italian Renaissance: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Drawing'', Konemann, Cologne, 1995. Pg. 308; Wundrum Pg. 147&lt;/ref&gt; the realistic depiction of both physical&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt and David G. Wilkins, ''History of Italian Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  and psychological features,&lt;ref&gt;Raunch pg. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and the manipulation of light and darkness, including tone contrast, [[sfumato]] (softening the transition between colours) and [[chiaroscuro]] (contrast between light and dark),&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 148; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; in a single unifying style&lt;ref&gt;Wundrum pg. 147; Hartt and Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; which expressed total compositional order, balance and harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture''; Harry N. Abrams Incorporated, New York, 1985, pg. 601; Wundrum pg. 147; Marilyn Stokstad ''Art History'', Third Edition, Pearson Education Inc., New Jersey, 2008. Pg 659&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the individual parts of the painting had a complex but balanced and well-knit relationship to the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Pg. 659&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous painters from this phase are Leonardo da Vinci, [[Raphael]], and Michelangelo and their images, including Leonardo's the [[Last Supper (da Vinci)|''Last Supper'']] and ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' and Michelangelo's ''[[Sistine Chapel Ceiling]]'' are the masterpieces of the period and among the most widely known works of art in the world.&lt;ref name="Frederick Hartt 2003"/&gt;

High Renaissance painting evolved into [[Mannerism]], especially in Florence.  Mannerist artists, who consciously rebelled against the principles of High Renaissance, tend to represent elongated figures in illogical spaces.   Modern scholarship has recognized the capacity of Mannerist art to convey strong (often religious) emotion where the High Renaissance failed to do so. Some of the main artists of this period are [[Pontormo]], [[Bronzino]], [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Parmigianino]] and Raphael's pupil [[Giulio Romano]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Italian Renaissance and Mannerist Art'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
[[File:Saint Peter's Basilica facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|[[St. Peter's Basilica]]. The dome, completed in 1590, was designed by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], architect, painter and poet.]]
{{Main|Italian Renaissance and Mannerist architecture}}
In [[Florence]], the Renaissance style was introduced with a revolutionary but incomplete monument in Rimini by [[Leone Battista Alberti]].  Some of the earliest buildings showing Renaissance characteristics are [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze|church of San Lorenzo]] and the [[Pazzi Chapel]]. The interior of ''Santo Spirito'' expresses a new sense of light, clarity and spaciousness, which is typical of the early Italian Renaissance.  Its architecture reflects the philosophy of [[Humanism]], the enlightenment and clarity of mind as opposed to the darkness and spirituality of the Middle Ages.  The revival of classical antiquity can best be illustrated by the [[Palazzo Rucellai]].  Here the [[pilaster]]s follow the superposition of [[classical orders]], with  [[Doric order|Doric]] [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] on the ground floor, [[Ionic order|Ionic]] capitals on the ''[[piano nobile]]'' and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitals on the uppermost floor. Soon, Renaissance architects favored grand, large domes over tall and imposing spires, doing away with the Gothic style of the predating ages.

In Mantua, [[Leone Battista Alberti]] ushered in the new antique style, though his culminating work, [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|Sant'Andrea]], was not begun until 1472, after the architect's death.

[[File:PalladioBramanteTempietto1570.jpg|thumb|[[Donato Bramante|Bramante]]'s ''Tempietto'' in San Pietro in Montorio, Rome, 1502]]
The High Renaissance, as we call the style today, was introduced to [[Rome]] with [[Donato Bramante]]'s [[San Pietro in Montorio|Tempietto at San Pietro in Montorio]] (1502) and his original centrally planned [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1506), which was the most notable architectural commission of the era, influenced by almost all notable Renaissance artists, including [[Michelangelo]] and [[Giacomo della Porta]].  The beginning of the late Renaissance in 1550 was marked by the development of a new column order by [[Andrea Palladio]].  Colossal columns that were two or more stories tall decorated the [[facade]]s.

===Music===
{{Main|Renaissance music}}
In Italy during the 14th century there was an explosion of musical activity that corresponded in scope and level of innovation to the activity in the other arts.  Although [[musicologist]]s typically group the music of the [[Trecento]] (music of the 14th century) with the late [[Medieval music|medieval]] period, it included features which align with the early Renaissance in important ways:  an increasing emphasis on secular sources, styles and forms; a spreading of culture away from ecclesiastical institutions to the nobility, and even to the common people; and a quick development of entirely new techniques.  The principal forms were the [[Madrigal (Trecento)|Trecento madrigal]], the [[caccia (music)|caccia]], and the [[ballata]]. Overall, the musical style of the period is sometimes labelled as the "Italian [[ars nova]]." From the early 15th century to the middle of the 16th century, the center of innovation in sacred music was in the [[Low Countries]], and a flood of talented composers came to Italy from this region.  Many of them sang in either the papal choir in Rome or the choirs at the numerous chapels of the aristocracy, in [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Milan]], [[Ferrara]] and elsewhere; and they brought their [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style with them, influencing many native Italian composers during their stay.

The predominant forms of church music during the period were the [[mass (music)|mass]] and the [[motet]].  By far the most famous composer of church music in 16th-century Italy was [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], the most prominent member of the [[Roman School]], whose style of smooth, emotionally cool polyphony was to become the defining sound of the late 16th century, at least for generations of 19th- and 20th-century musicologists.  Other Italian composers of the late 16th century focused on composing the main secular form of the era, the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]:  and for almost a hundred years these secular songs for multiple singers were distributed all over Europe.  Composers of madrigals included [[Jacques Arcadelt]], at the beginning of the age, [[Cipriano de Rore]], in the middle of the century, and [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Philippe de Monte]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], and [[Claudio Monteverdi]] at the end of the era. Italy was also a centre of innovation in instrumental music.  By the early 16th century keyboard improvisation came to be greatly valued, and numerous composers of virtuoso keyboard music appeared.  Many familiar instruments were invented and perfected in late Renaissance Italy, such as the [[violin]], the earliest forms of which came into use in the 1550s.

By the late 16th century Italy was the musical centre of Europe.  Almost all of the innovations which were to define the transition to the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] period originated in northern Italy in the last few decades of the century.  In Venice, the [[Venetian polychoral style|polychoral]] productions of the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian School]], and associated instrumental music, moved north into Germany; in Florence, the [[Florentine Camerata]] developed [[monody]], the important precursor to [[opera]], which itself first appeared around 1600; and the avant-garde, [[mannerism|manneristic]] style of the [[Ferrara school]], which migrated to [[Naples]] and elsewhere through the music of [[Carlo Gesualdo]], was to be the final statement of the polyphonic vocal music of the Renaissance.

'''Loess''' ({{IPAc-en|US|l|ɛ|s|,_|ˈ|l|oʊ|.|ə|s|,_|l|ʌ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|l|ɜ|s}}; from [[German language|German]] ''Löss'' {{IPA-de|lœs|}}) is a [[clastic rock|clastic]], predominantly silt-sized sediment that is formed by the accumulation of wind-blown dust.&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011"/&gt; 10% of the Earth's land area is covered by loess or similar deposits.&lt;ref name=" VasiljevicEtAl2011"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://ojs.zrc-sazu.si/ags/article/viewFile/1328/1091 | title=Loess Towards (Geo) Tourism – Proposed Application on Loess in Vojvodina Region (North Serbia) | first=D.

Loess is an [[aeolian processes|aeolian]] sediment formed by the accumulation of wind-blown [[silt]],&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, I.J., Derbyshire, E. 1990. The definition of 'ice-sheet' and 'mountain' loess. Area 22, 300-301&lt;/ref&gt; typically in the 20–50 micrometer size range, twenty percent or less [[clay]] and the balance equal parts [[sand]] and silt&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, Miller, Shickluna (1977). Soils: An Introduction to Soils and Plant Growth, 4th edition. Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt; that are loosely cemented by [[calcium carbonate]]. It is usually homogeneous and highly porous and is traversed by vertical capillaries that permit the sediment to fracture and form vertical bluffs.

The word ''loess'', with connotations of origin by wind-deposited accumulation, came into English from [[German language|German]] ''Löss'', which can be traced back to [[Alemannic German|Swiss German]] and is [[cognate]] with the English word ''loose'' and the German word ''los''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=loess|title=loess - Origin and meaning of loess by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first applied to Rhine River valley loess about 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/346022/loess |title=loess (sedimentary deposit) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwds.de/?qu=L%C3%B6ss&amp;submit_button=Suche&amp;view=1 |title=DWDS &amp;#124; Suchergebnisse |publisher=Dwds.de |accessdate=2013-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:Loess landscape china.jpg|thumb|left|Loess near [[Hunyuan]], [[Shanxi]] province, [[China]].]]
Loess is [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]], [[porous]], [[friable]], pale yellow or [[buff (color)|buff]], slightly [[wikt:coherent|coherent]], typically non-[[stratum|stratified]] and often [[calcareous]].  Loess grains are [[Rounding (sediment)|angular]] with little polishing or rounding and composed of crystals of [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], [[mica]] and other [[mineral]]s. Loess can be described as a rich, dust-like soil.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Prentice Hall - World Studies - Europe and Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

Loess deposits may become very thick, more than a hundred meters in areas of China and tens of meters in parts of the Midwestern United States. It generally occurs as a blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.

Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces.&lt;ref&gt;Neuendorf, K.E.K., J.P. Mehl Jr., and J.A. Jackson, 2005, ''Glossary of Geology.'' [[Springer-Verlag]], [[New York City]], 779 pp., {{ISBN|3-540-27951-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the grains are angular, loess will often stand in banks for many years without [[Slump (geology)|slump]]ing. This soil has a characteristic called vertical cleavage which makes it easily excavated to form cave dwellings, a popular method of making [[yaodong|human habitations]] in some parts of China. Loess will erode very readily.

In several areas of the world, loess [[ridge]]s have formed that are aligned with the [[prevailing wind]]s during the last [[glacial maximum]].  These are called "[[paha (landform)|paha]] ridges" in America and "greda ridges" in [[Europe]].  The form of these loess [[dune]]s has been explained by a combination of wind and [[tundra]] conditions.

==Etymology==
''Loess'' comes from the German ''Löss'' or ''Löß'', and ultimately from [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] ''lösch'' meaning ''drop'' as named by [[peasants]] and [[masonry|mason]]s along the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].

==History of research==
The term "Löß" was first described in Central Europe by [[Karl Cäsar von Leonhard]] (1823–1824)&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard K. C. von (1823–1824). ''Charakteristik der Felsarten''. 3 Vols., J. Engelmann Verlag Heidelberg, pp. 772.&lt;/ref&gt; who reported yellowish brown, silty deposits along the Rhine valley near [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011"/&gt; [[Charles Lyell]] (1834) brought this term into widespread usage by observing similarities between loess and loess derivatives along the loess bluffs in the Rhine and Mississippi.&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011" /&gt; At that time it was thought that the yellowish brown silt-rich sediment was of [[fluvial]] origin being deposited by the large rivers.&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011" /&gt; It wasn't until the end of the 19th century that the [[Aeolian processes|aeolian]] origin of loess was recognized (Virlet D'Aoust 1857),&lt;ref&gt;Virlet D'Aoust P.T. (1857). "Observations sur un terrain d`origine météorique ou de transport aerien qui existe au Mexique et sur le phénomène des trombes de poussière auquel il doit principalement son origine". ''[[Geol. Soc. France, Full.]]'', 2d, Ser. 2, 129–139.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the convincing observations of loess in China by [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]] (1878).&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richthofen F. von (1878). "Bemerkungen zur Lößbildung". ''[[Verh Geol Reichsanst]]'', Berlin, pp 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; A tremendous number of papers have been published since then, focusing on the formation of loess and on loess/[[Paleosol|palaeosol]] (older soil buried under deposits) sequences as archives of climate and environment change.&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011"/&gt; These water conservation works were carried out extensively in China and the research of Loess in China has been continued since 1954. (Liu TS, Loess and the environment)

Much effort was put into the setting up of regional and local loess [[stratigraphy|stratigraphies]] and their correlation (Kukla 1970, 1975, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;Kukla G. (1970). "Correlation between loesses and deep-sea sediments". ''[[Geologiske Foreningen Foerhandlingar]]'' '''92''': 148–180. Stockholm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kukla G. J. (1975). "Loess stratigraphy of Central Europe". In: Butzer K. W. &amp; Isaac G. L. (eds.) After the Australopithecus, pp. 99–188. Mouton, The Hague.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kukla |first1=G. J. |year=1977 |title=Pleistocene Land-Sea Correlations I.

Since the 1980s, [[thermoluminescence]] (TL), [[optically stimulated luminescence]] (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating are available providing the possibility for dating the time of loess (dust) deposition, i.e. the time elapsed since the last exposure of the mineral grains to daylight.&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011" /&gt; During the past decade, [[luminescence dating]] has significantly improved by new methodological improvements, especially the development of single [[wikt:aliquot|aliquot]] regenerative (SAR) protocols (Murray &amp; Wintle 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=A.

==Formation==
According to Pye (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pye | first1 = K | year = 1995 | title = The nature, origin and accumulation of loess | url = | journal = [[Quaternary Science Reviews]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 653–667 | doi=10.1016/0277-3791(95)00047-x| bibcode = 1995QSRv...14..653P}}&lt;/ref&gt; four fundamental requirements are necessary for the formation of loess: a dust source, adequate wind energy to transport the dust, a suitable accumulation area, and a sufficient amount of time.&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011"/&gt;

===Periglacial loess===
[[Periglacial]] (glacial) loess is derived from the floodplains of [[glacier|glacial]] [[braided river]]s that carried large volumes of glacial meltwater and sediments from the annual melting of continental icesheets and mountain icecaps during the spring and summer. During the autumn and winter, when melting of the icesheets and icecaps ceased, the flow of meltwater down these rivers either ceased or was greatly reduced. As a consequence, large parts of the formerly submerged and unvegetated floodplains of these braided rivers dried out and were exposed to the wind. Because these floodplains consist of sediment containing a high content of glacially ground flour-like [[silt]] and [[clay]], they were highly susceptible to winnowing of their silts and [[clay]]s by the wind. Once entrained by the wind, particles were then deposited downwind. The loess deposits found along both sides of the [[Mississippi embayment|Mississippi River Alluvial Valley]] are a classic example of periglacial loess.&lt;ref name="MuhsOthers2003a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bettis|first1=E.A.|last2=Muhs|first2=D.R.|last3=Roberts|first3=H.M.|last4=Wintle|first4=A.G.|title=Last Glacial loess in the conterminous USA|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=2003|volume=22|issue=18–19|pages=1907–1946|doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(03)00169-0|bibcode=2003QSRv...22.1907A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esp.cr.usgs.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muhs|first1= D.R.|first2=E.A. |last2=Bettis, III|date=2003|url=http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/info/eolian/MuhsBettis2003GSAsp370.pdf |title=Quaternary loess-paleosol sequences as examples of climate-driven sedimentary extremes|journal=GSA Special Papers|volume=370|pages= 53–74|doi=10.1130/0-8137-2370-1.53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Quaternary]], loess and loess-like sediments were formed in periglacial environments on mid-continental [[Shield (geology)|shield]] areas in Europe and Siberia, on the margins of high mountain ranges like in [[Tajikistan]] and on semi-arid margins of some lowland deserts like in China.&lt;ref name="Frechen 2011"/&gt;

In England, periglacial loess is also known as [[brickearth]].

===Non-glacial===
Non-glacial loess can originate from [[desert]]s, [[dune field]]s, [[playa lake]]s, and [[volcanic ash]].

Some types of nonglacial loess are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Iriondo | first1 = M.H. | last2 = Krohling | first2 = D.M. | year = 2007 | title = Non-classical types of loess | journal = [[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]] | volume = 202 | issue = 3| pages = 352–368 | bibcode=2007SedG..202..352I | doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2007.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fertility==
Loess tends to develop into very rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, it is some of the most agriculturally productive terrain in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Getis|first=Arthur|author2=Judith Getis and Jerome D. Fellmann|title=Introduction to Geography, Seventh Edition|year=2000 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]|isbn=0-697-38506-X |page= 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soils underlain by loess tend to be excessively drained. The fine grains [[weathering|weather]] rapidly due to their large surface area, making soils derived from loess rich.  One theory states that the fertility of loess soils is due largely to [[cation exchange capacity]] (the ability of plants to absorb nutrients from the soil) and [[porosity]] (the air-filled space in the soil). The fertility of loess is not due to organic matter content, which tends to be rather low, unlike tropical soils which derive their fertility almost wholly from organic matter.

Even well managed loess [[arable land|farmland]] can experience dramatic [[erosion]] of well over 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg /m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per year. In China the [[Loess Plateau|loess deposits]] which give the [[Yellow River]] its color have been farmed and have produced phenomenal yields for over one thousand years. Winds pick up loess particles, contributing to the [[Asian Dust]] pollution problem. The largest deposit of loess in the United States, the [[Loess Hills]] along the border of [[Iowa]] and Nebraska, has survived intensive farming and [[Land degradation|poor farming practices]]. For almost 150 years, this loess deposit was farmed with [[mouldboard plough]]s and fall tilled, both intensely erosive. At times it suffered erosion rates of over 10 kilograms per square meter per year. Today this loess deposit is worked as low till or [[no till]] in all areas and is aggressively [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Large areas of loess deposits and soils==
===Argentina===
[[File:ArgentinaLoess.JPG|right|thumb|An [[outcrop]] of loess in [[Patagonia]]]]
Much of Argentina is covered by loess. Two areas of loess are usually distinguished in Argentina: the neotropical loess north of [[30th parallel south|latitude 30° S]] and the pampean loess.&lt;ref name=Sagayo/&gt;

The neotropical loess is made of silt or silty clay. Relative to the pampean loess the neotropical loess is poor in [[quartz]] and [[calcium carbonate]]. The source region for this loess is thought by some scientists to be areas of [[fluvio-glacial]] depostis the Andean foothills formed by the [[Patagonian Ice Sheet]]. Other researchers stress the importance of [[tephra|volcanic material]] in the neotropical loess.&lt;ref name=Sagayo/&gt;

The pampean loess is sandy or made of silty sand.&lt;ref name=Sagayo&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sagayo |first=José Manuel |date=1995 |title=The Argentine neotropical loess: An overview |url= |journal=Quaternary Science Reviews |publisher=Pergamon |volume=14 |issue=7–8 |pages=755–766 |doi=10.1016/0277-3791(95)00050-X |bibcode=1995QSRv...14..755S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
The [[Loess Plateau]] (simplified Chinese: 黄土高原; traditional Chinese: 黃土高原; pinyin: huángtǔ gāoyuán), also known as the Huangtu Plateau, is a [[plateau]] that covers an area of some 640,000&amp;nbsp;km² in the upper and middle of [[China]]'s [[Yellow River]] and China proper.  The Yellow River was so named because the loess forming its banks gave a yellowish tint to the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Huang He |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/hu/HuangHe.html |encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]] |edition=6th |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605050404/http://www.bartleby.com/65/hu/HuangHe.html |archivedate=June 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soil of this region has been called the "most highly erodible soil on earth".&lt;ref&gt;John M.

The [[Loess Hills]] of Iowa owe their fertility to the [[prairie]] [[topsoil]]s built by 10,000 years of post-glacial accumulation of organic-rich [[humus]] as a consequence of a persistent [[grassland]] [[biome]]. When the valuable [[A horizon|A-horizon]] topsoil is eroded or degraded, the underlying loess soil is infertile, and requires the addition of [[fertilizer]] in order to support [[agriculture]].

The loess along the [[Mississippi River]] near [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]], [[Mississippi]], consist of three layers. The ''Peoria Loess'', ''Sicily Island Loess'', and ''Crowley's Ridge Loess'' accumulated at different periods of time during the [[Pleistocene]]. Ancient soils, called [[paleosol]]s, have developed in the top of the Sicily Island Loess and Crowley's Ridge Loess. The lowermost loess, the Crowley's Ridge Loess, accumulated during the late [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]]. The middle loess, Sicily Island Loess, accumulated during early [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin Stage]]. The uppermost loess, the Peoria Loess, in which the modern soil has developed, accumulated during the late Wisconsin Stage.

'''Léon Philippe Teisserenc de Bort''' (5 November 1855 in [[Paris]], [[France]] – 2 January 1913 in [[Cannes]], France) was a [[France|French]] [[meteorology|meteorologist]] and a pioneer in the field of [[aerology]]. Together with [[Richard Assmann]] (1845-1918), he is credited as co-discoverer of the [[stratosphere]], as both men announced their discovery during the same time period in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OlckxY7BA_0C&amp;pg=PA17] Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier&lt;/ref&gt; 
Teisserenc de Bort pioneered the use of unmanned instrumented [[weather balloon|balloons]] and was the first to identify the region in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] around 8-17 kilometers of height where the [[adiabatic lapse rate|lapse rate]] reaches zero, known today as the [[tropopause]].

==Early life and career==
He was the son of an engineer. He began his scientific career in 1880, when he entered the meteorological department of the Bureau Central Météorologique (Administrative Center of National Meteorology, a department of the French government) in [[Paris]] under [[Éleuthère Mascart|E. E. N. Mascart]]. In 1883, 1885 and 1887 he made journeys to [[North Africa]] to study geology and terrestrial magnetism, and during this, period published some important charts of the distribution of pressure at a height of 4,000 metres. Between 1892 and 1896, Teisserenc de Bort was chief meteorologist to the Bureau.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Teisserenc de Bort, Léon Philippe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumented balloons pioneer==
After his resignation from the Bureau in 1896, he established a private meteorological observatory in [[Trappes]] near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. There he carried out investigations on clouds and the problems of the upper air. He conducted experiments with high-flying instrumented [[hydrogen]] balloons and was one of the first people to use such devices.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meteohistory.org/2004polling_preprints/docs/abstracts/fonton_abstract.pdf Teisserenc de Bort a life in Meteorology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, Teisserenc de Bort published an important paper in ''Comptes Rendus'' detailing his researches by means of balloons into the constitution of the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;  He noticed that while the air [[temperature]] decreased steadily up to approximately 11 kilometers of height, it remained constant above that [[altitude]] (up to the highest points he could reach). In other words, he discovered an indication of a [[temperature inversion]] or at least of a zero lapse rate above this altitude. For many years he was uncertain whether he discovered a true [[physical phenomenon]] or whether his measurements suffered from a systematic [[bias]] (indeed, the first measurements ''did'' have a positive temperature bias as the instruments were liable to radiative heating by [[solar radiation]]). That is why Teisserenc de Bort carried out 200+ more balloon experiments (with a substantial part of them being held during the night to eliminate radiative heating) until 1902, when he suggested that the atmosphere was divided into two layers.

==Troposphere and stratosphere==
During the years that followed, he named the two [[Earth's atmosphere|layers of the atmosphere]] known as the "[[troposphere]]" and the "[[stratosphere]]". This naming convention has since been maintained, with (higher-altitude) layers that were subsequently discovered being given names of this sort. After Teisserenc de Bort's death in 1913, the heirs donated the observatory to the state so that the research tasks could be continued.

==Additional investigations==
He also carried out investigations in [[Sweden]] and over the [[Zuider Zee]], the [[Mediterranean]] and the tropical region of the [[Atlantic]], and fitted out a special vessel in order to study the currents above the [[trade winds]]. He was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] in 1903, honorary member in 1909, and was awarded the [[Symons Gold Medal]] of the Society in 1908. He collaborated with [[Hugo Hildebrandsson]] in ''Les bases de la météorologie dynamique'' (1907).&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5407">'''Meteorological intelligence''' is [[information]] measured, gathered, compiled, exploited, analyzed and disseminated by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], [[Climatology|climatologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] to characterize the current state and/or predict the future state of the [[atmosphere]] at a given location and time.  Meteorological intelligence is a subset of [[environmental intelligence]] and is synonymous with the term [[weather intelligence]].  

The earliest known use of the term "meteorological intelligence" in a written document dates to 1854 on pg. 168 of the Eighth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  This report discusses the Smithsonian Institution's initiative to transmit meteorological intelligence via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines.  An early reference to "meteorological intelligence" in England dates an 1866 issue of [[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]] which was a prominent [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journal during the 19th century (Reeve 1866, pg. 75).  

Another documented, early use of the term dates to 1874 in a historical compilation entitled, "The American Historical Record" (Lossing 1874, pg. 125).  In this book, Lossing uses the term to refer to weather observations transmitted over telegraph lines for the purpose of studying the nature of [[storm]]s with the ultimate goal of enhancing public safety through the issuance of storm warnings.  This mission was carried out by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Service]] starting in the 1870s who was responsible for communication (via telegraph) of technical [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the army as well as "meteorological intelligence" for the general welfare of the country (Ingersoll 1879, pg. 156).

From the viewpoint of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence community]], the term meteorological intelligence is more limited in its use referring to the use of [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] or technical means to learn about environmental conditions over enemy territory (Shulsky and Schmitt 2002) as in the [[North Atlantic weather war]]. In the [[military intelligence]] context, weather information is often referred to as meteorological or environmental intelligence (Hinsley 1990, pg. 420; Platt 1957, pg. 14; U.S. Congress, pg. 164). 

With regard to private sector [[meteorology]], the term meteorological intelligence is a broad term of art that is primarily associated with observed and forecast weather information provided to decision makers in one of a number of weather sensitive business areas including: Energy, [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[transport]]ation, [[aviation]], [[entertainment]], [[Retailing|retail]] and [[construction]] (CMOS 2001, pg. 23) .  It is considered a key aspect of [[weather risk management]] for the legal and [[insurance]] industries.

[[File:Carlo Crivelli 007.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Aquinas]], a [[Catholic philosopher]] of the [[Middle Ages]], revived and developed the concept of natural law from [[ancient Greek philosophy]].]]

'''Natural law''' ({{lang-la|ius naturale}}, ''lex naturalis'') is a [[philosophy]] asserting that certain [[human right|rights]] are inherent by virtue of [[human nature]], endowed by [[nature]]—traditionally by [[God]] or a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] source—and that these can be understood universally through [[human reason]]. As determined by nature, the '''law of nature''' is implied to be objective and universal;&lt;ref name="IESS"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Strauss|first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Strauss |title=Natural Law |encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences |year=1968 |publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; it exists independently of human understanding, and of the [[positive law]] of a given [[Sovereign state|state]], [[political order]], [[legislature]] or [[society]] at large.

Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze [[human nature]] to [[Deductive reasoning|deduce]] binding rules of [[moral behavior]] from nature's or God's creation of [[reality]] and [[Human|mankind]]. The concept of natural law was documented in [[ancient Greek philosophy]], including [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;Rommen, Heinrich A., ''The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social Philosophy'' trans. Thomas R. Hanley, O.S.B., Ph.D. (B. Herder Book Co., 1947 [reprinted 1959]), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and was referred to in [[Roman philosophy]] by [[Cicero]]. References to natural law are also found in the Old and New Testaments of the [[Bible]], later expounded upon in the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Christian philosopher]]s such as [[Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]. The [[School of Salamanca]] made notable contributions during the [[Renaissance]]. Modern natural law theories were greatly developed in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], combining inspiration from [[Roman law]] with philosophies like [[social contract]] theory. Key proponents were [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Francisco Suárez]], [[Richard Hooker]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]], [[John Locke]], [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[Jean Jacques Burlamaqui]],  [[Emmerich de Vattel]], [[Cesare Beccaria]] and [[Francesco Mario Pagano]]. It was used to challenge the [[divine right of kings]], and became an alternative justification for the establishment of a [[social contract]], [[positive law]], and [[government]]—and thus legal rights—in the form of [[classical republicanism]]. Conversely, the concept of natural rights is used by others to challenge the legitimacy of all such establishments.

Contemporarily, the concept of natural law is closely related to the concept of [[natural rights]]. Indeed, many [[philosopher]]s, [[jurist]]s and scholars use natural law synonymously with natural rights ({{lang-la|[[ius naturale]]}}), or [[natural justice]].&lt;ref name="Shellens" /&gt; while others distinguish between natural law and natural right.&lt;ref name="IESS" /&gt;

Because of the intersection between natural law and [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], natural law has been cited as a component in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] (1776), and claimed by natural law proponents thus to be incorporated into its constitution, as well as in the [[France|French]] ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' (1789), hence providing a foundation for the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'' (1948) of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

== History ==
The use of natural law, in its various incarnations, has varied widely throughout history. There are a number of theories of natural law, that differ from each other with respect to the role that morality plays in determining the authority of legal norms. This article deals with its usages separately rather than attempt to unify them into a single theory.

===Judaism===
Those who see [[Torah|biblical]] support for the doctrine of natural law often point to [[Abraham]]'s interrogation of [[God in Judaism|God]] on behalf of the iniquitous city of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]. Abraham even dares to tell the Most High that his plan to destroy the city (Genesis 18:25) would violate God’s own justice: “That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?" This almost Socratic reply became for later writers the beginnings of natural rights theory. In this respect, natural law as described in the interaction between Abraham and God predates the later Greek exposition of it by Plato, Socrates and Aristotle.

However, an even earlier set of laws is attributed to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The seven [[Noahidism|Noahide]] laws as traditionally enumerated are the following:&lt;ref name="Jewishvirtuallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Shared values: The Noahide Laws|url=http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/shared-values-noahide-laws/|access-date=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Josef Meri|title=The Routledge Handbook of Muslim-Jewish Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXF9DAAAQBAJ&amp; |date=23 June 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-38320-8|pages=191–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Not to worship idols.
# Not to curse God.
# To establish courts of justice.
# Not to commit murder.
# Not to commit adultery or sexual immorality.
# Not to steal.
# Not to eat flesh torn from a living animal.
According to the [[Genesis flood narrative]], a [[Deluge (mythology)|deluge]] covered the whole world, killing every surface-dwelling creature except Noah, his wife, his sons and their wives, and the animals taken aboard [[Noah's Ark]]. According to this, all modern humans are descendants of Noah, thus the name Noahide Laws in reference to laws that apply to all of humanity. After the flood, God sealed a [[Covenant (biblical)#Noahic covenant|covenant with Noah]] with the following admonitions ({{bibleverse||Genesis|9|HE}}):
* Flesh of a living animal: "Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.” (9:4)
* Murder and courts: "And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it; and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made He man." (9:5-6)

===Ancient Greece===
==== Plato ====
{{Original research section|date=May 2011}}Although [[Plato]] did not have an explicit theory of natural law (he rarely used the phrase 'natural law' except in ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' 484 and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 83e), his concept of nature, according to John Wild, contains some of the elements found in many natural law theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wild|first=John|year=1953|title=Plato's Modern Enemies and the Theory of Natural Law|location=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plato, we live in an orderly universe.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' 508a.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of this orderly universe or nature are the [[Theory of forms|forms]], most fundamentally the [[Form of the Good]], which Plato describes as "the brightest region of Being".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', 518b–d.&lt;/ref&gt; The Form of the Good is the cause of all things, and when it is seen it leads a person to act wisely.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', 540a, 517b–d.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', the Good is closely identified with the Beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', 205e–6a.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Symposium'', Plato describes how the experience of the Beautiful by Socrates enabled him to resist the temptations of wealth and sex.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Symposium'', 211d–e.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the ideal community is "a city which would be established in accordance with nature".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', 428e9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aristotle ====
{{see also|Treatise on Law}}
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of ''[[The School of Athens]]'', a fresco by [[Raphael]].]]
[[Greek philosophy]] emphasized the distinction between "nature" (''physis'', ''φúσις'') on the one hand and "law", "custom", or "convention" (''nomos'', ''νóμος'') on the other. What the law commanded would be expected to vary from place to place, but what was "by nature" should be the same everywhere. A "law of nature" would therefore have the flavor more of a paradox than something that obviously existed.&lt;ref name="IESS" /&gt; Against the [[conventionalism]] that the distinction between nature and custom could engender, [[Socrates]] and his philosophic heirs, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (''dikaion physikon'', ''δικαιον φυσικον'', [[Latin]] ''ius naturale''). Of these, Aristotle is often said to be the father of natural law.&lt;ref name="Shellens"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shellens|first=Max Solomon|title=Aristotle on Natural Law|journal=Natural Law Forum|volume=4|issue=1|year=1959|pages=72–100|doi=10.1093/ajj/4.1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's association with natural law may be due to the interpretation given to his works by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Jaffa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaffa|first=Harry|authorlink=Harry V. Jaffa|title=Thomism and Aristotelianism|origyear=1952|year=1979|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; But whether Aquinas correctly read Aristotle is in dispute. According to some, Aquinas conflates natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Book IV of the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]''). According to this interpretation, Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages in an unfortunate manner, though more recent translations render those more literally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Corbett|first=Ross J.|title=The Philosophic Context of the Development of Natural Law| date=April 2012 |conference=Midwest Political Science Association|ssrn=2021235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle notes that [[natural justice]] is a species of political justice, specifically the scheme of [[distributive justice|distributive]] and [[restorative justice|corrective justice]] that would be established under the best political community; were this to take the form of law, this could be called a natural law, though Aristotle does not discuss this and suggests in the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' that the best regime may not rule by law at all.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ross J.|last=Corbett|title=The Question of Natural Law in Aristotle|journal=History of Political Thought|volume=30|issue=2| date=Summer 2009 |pages=229–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', where Aristotle notes that, aside from the "particular" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a "common" law that is according to nature.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'' 1373b2–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he quotes Sophocles and Empedocles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Universal law is the law of Nature. For there really is, as every one to some extent divines, a natural justice and injustice that is binding on all men, even on those who have no association or covenant with each other. It is this that Sophocles' Antigone clearly means when she says that the burial of Polyneices was a just act in spite of the prohibition: she means that it was just by nature:

:"Not of to-day or yesterday it is,
:But lives eternal: none can date its birth."

And so Empedocles, when he bids us kill no living creature, he is saying that to do this is not just for some people, while unjust for others:

:"Nay, but, an all-embracing law, through the realms of the sky
:Unbroken it stretcheth, and over the earth's immensity."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Rhetoric, Book I – Chapter 13, {{cite web |url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-13.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213075009/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-13.html |archivedate=2015-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics believe that the context of this remark suggests only that Aristotle advised that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the "particular" law of one's own city was averse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law;&lt;ref name="Shellens" /&gt; Moreover, they claim that Aristotle considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law provided in this passage to be wrong.&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt; Aristotle's paternity of natural law tradition is consequently disputed.

==== Stoic natural law&lt;!--linked from 'Stoicism'--&gt; ====
The development of this tradition of [[natural justice]] into one of natural law is usually attributed to the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. The rise of natural law as a universal system coincided with the rise of large empires and kingdoms in the Greek world.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Introduction to Jurisprudence'', Seventh Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}} Whereas the "higher" law that Aristotle suggested one could appeal to was emphatically [[Appeal to nature|natural]], in contradistinction to being the result of [[Divinity|divine]] [[Positive law|positive]] [[legislation]], the Stoic natural law was indifferent to either the natural or divine source of the law: the Stoics asserted the existence of a rational and purposeful order to the universe (a [[Divine law|divine]] or [[eternal law]]), and the means by which a rational being lived in accordance with this order was the natural law, which inspired actions that accorded with virtue.&lt;ref name="IESS"/&gt;

As the English historian A. J. Carlyle (1861–1943) notes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no change in political theory so startling in its completeness as the change from the theory of Aristotle to the later philosophical view represented by Cicero and Seneca&amp;nbsp;... We think that this cannot be better exemplified than with regard to the theory of the equality of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. J.|last=Carlyle|title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West, vol. 1|location=Edinburgh|year=1903|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles H. McIlwain likewise observes that "the idea of the equality of men is the most profound contribution of the Stoics to political thought" and that "its greatest influence is in the changed conception of law that in part resulted from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles H.|last=McIlwain|title=The Growth of Political Thought in the West: From the Greeks to the End of the Middle Ages|location=New York|year=1932|pages=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Natural law first appeared among the stoics who believed that God is everywhere and in everyone (see [[classical pantheism]]). According to this belief, within humans there is a "divine spark" which helps them to live in accordance with nature. The stoics felt that there was a way in which the universe had been designed, and that natural law helped us to harmonise with this.

=== Ancient Rome ===
[[File:Thorvaldsen Cicero.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Marcus Tullius Cicero]]]]
[[Cicero]] wrote in his [[De Legibus]] that both justice and law originate from what nature has given to humanity, from what the human mind embraces, from the function of humanity, and from what serves to unite humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'', bk. 1, sec. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; For Cicero, natural law obliges us to contribute to the general good of the larger society.&lt;ref name="Barham"&gt;{{cite book|first=Francis|last=Barham|contribution=Introduction|title=The Political Works of Marcus Tullius Cicero|location=London|publisher=Edmund Spettigue|year=1842|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=747&amp;Itemid=284|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808205547/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=747&amp;Itemid=284|archivedate=2010-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of positive laws is to provide for "the safety of citizens, the preservation of states, and the tranquility and happiness of human life." In this view, "wicked and unjust statutes" are "anything but 'laws,'" because "in the very definition of the term 'law' there [[wikt:inheres|inheres]] the idea and principle of choosing what is just and true."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), bk. 2, sec. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Law, for Cicero, "ought to be a reformer of vice and an incentive to virtue."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Legibus'' (Keyes translation), bk. 1, sec. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero expressed the view that "the virtues which we ought to cultivate, always tend to our own happiness, and that the best means of promoting them consists in living with men in that perfect union and charity which are cemented by mutual benefits."&lt;ref name="Barham" /&gt;

In De Re Publica, he writes:
{{quote|There is indeed a law, right reason, which is in accordance with nature ; existing in all, unchangeable, eternal. Commanding us to do what is right, forbidding us to do what is wrong. It has dominion over good men, but possesses no influence over bad ones. No other law can be substituted for it, no part of it can be taken away, nor can it be abrogated altogether. Neither the people or the senate can absolve from it. It is not one thing at Rome, and another thing at Athens : one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow ; but it is eternal and immutable for all nations and for all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/republicofcicero00cicerich/republicofcicero00cicerich_djvu.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303160447/http://www.archive.org/stream/republicofcicero00cicerich/republicofcicero00cicerich_djvu.txt |archivedate=2017-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cicero influenced the discussion of natural law for many centuries to come, up through the era of the American Revolution. The jurisprudence of the [[Roman Empire]] was rooted in Cicero, who held "an extraordinary grip ... upon the imagination of posterity" as "the medium for the propagation of those ideas which informed the law and institutions of the empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles Norris|last=Cochrane|title=Christianity and Classical Culture: A Study of Thought and Action from Augustus to Augustine|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1957|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's conception of natural law "found its way to later centuries notably through the writings of [[Isidore of Seville|Saint Isidore of Seville]] and the [[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum of Gratian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward S.|last=Corwin|title=The "Higher Law" Background of American Constitutional Law|location=Ithaca, NY|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1955|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his summary of medieval natural law, quoted Cicero's statement that "nature" and "custom" were the sources of a society's laws.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''Treatise on Law'' (Summa Theologica, Questions 90–97), ed.

===Christianity===
The New Testament carries a further exposition on the Abrahamic dialogue and links to the later Greek exposition on the subject, when [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Romans]] states: "For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves: Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Romans|2:14–15|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intellectual historian A. J. Carlyle has commented on this passage, "There can be little doubt that St Paul's words imply some conception analogous to the 'natural law' in [[Cicero]], a law written in men's hearts, recognized by man's reason, a law distinct from the positive law of any State, or from what St Paul recognized as [[Torah|the revealed law of God]]. It is in this sense that St Paul's words are taken by the Fathers of the fourth and fifth centuries like [[Hilary of Poitiers|St Hilary of Poitiers]], [[Ambrose|St Ambrose]], and [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]], and there seems no reason to doubt the correctness of their interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A. J.|last=Carlyle|title=A History of Medieval Political Theory in the West|volume=1|page=83|url=https://archive.org/details/ahistorymedival00carlgoog|location=New York|publisher=G.P.

Because of its origins in the Old Testament, early [[Church Fathers]], especially those in the [[Western Christianity|West]], saw natural law as part of the natural foundation of [[Christianity]]. The most notable among these was [[Augustine of Hippo]], who equated natural law with humanity's [[fall of man|prelapsarian]] state; as such, a life according to unbroken human nature was no longer possible and persons needed instead to seek healing and salvation through the [[divine law]] and [[divine grace|grace]] of [[Jesus Christ]].

In the twelfth century, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] equated the natural law with divine law. [[Albertus Magnus]] would address the subject a century later, and his pupil, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]], in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' [[Treatise on Law|I-II qq. 90–106]], restored Natural Law to its independent state, asserting natural law as the rational creature's participation in the eternal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2091.htm#article2 Summa Theologica, I-II, Q. 91, Art. 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704182120/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2091.htm |date=2007-07-04 }} "I answer that"&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, since human reason could not fully comprehend the [[Eternal law]], it needed to be supplemented by revealed [[Divine law]]. (See also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].) Meanwhile, Aquinas taught that all human or positive laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law is not a law, in the full sense of the word. It retains merely the 'appearance' of law insofar as it is duly constituted and enforced in the same way a just law is, but is itself a 'perversion of law.'&lt;ref&gt;''Summa Theologicae,'' Q. 95, A. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what those  laws meant in the first place. This principle laid the seed for possible societal tension with reference to tyrants.&lt;ref name="Burns"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burns|first=Tony|year=2000|title=Aquinas's Two Doctrines of Natural Law|journal=Political Studies|volume=48|pages=929–46|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00288|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural law was inherently [[teleological]], however, it is most assuredly not [[deontological]]. For Christians, natural law is how human beings manifest the divine image in their life. This mimicry of [[Jesus Christ|God]]'s own life is impossible to accomplish except by means of the power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact that humanity is made in God's image, humanity is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how humanity displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within human control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction may or may not be attained, but salvation will be attained. The [[State (polity)|state]], in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.

In the 16th century, the [[School of Salamanca]] ([[Francisco Suárez]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]], etc.) further developed a philosophy of natural law.

After the [[Protestant Reformation]], some [[Protestant denominations]] maintained parts of the Catholic concept of natural law. The [[England|English]] [[theology|theologian]] [[Richard Hooker]] from the [[Church of England]] adapted [[Thomism|Thomistic]] notions of natural law to [[Anglicanism]]  five principles: to live, to learn, to reproduce, to worship God, and to live in an ordered society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.rsrevision.com/Alevel/ethics/revision/natural_law_aspects_of_theory.pdf | title=Natural Law aspects of theory | publisher=Rsrevision.com | medium=[[PDF]] | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026050618/http://www.rsrevision.com/Alevel/ethics/revision/natural_law_aspects_of_theory.pdf | archivedate=2014-10-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic natural law===
[[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], an [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]] and [[polymath]] [[Islamic science|scientist]], understood natural law as the survival of the fittest. He argued that the [[:wikt:antagonism|antagonism]] between [[human]] beings can only be overcome through a [[divine law]], which he believed to have been sent through [[prophets of Islam|prophets]]. This is also the position of the [[Ashari]] school, the largest school of Sunni theology.&lt;ref name="Corbin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Corbin|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Corbin|title=History of Islamic Philosophy|others=Translated by Liadain Sherrard and [[Philip Sherrard]]|publisher=London; Kegan Paul International in association with Islamic Publications for The Institute of Ismaili Studies|isbn=0-7103-0416-1|page=39|year=1993|origyear= 1964}} (original in French.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd), in his treatise on ''Justice and Jihad'' and his commentary on Plato's ''Republic'', writes that the human mind can know of the unlawfulness of killing and stealing and thus of the five [[maqasid]] or higher intents of the Islamic [[sharia]] or to protect religion, life, property, offspring, and reason. The concept of natural law entered the mainstream of [[Western culture]] through his Aristotelian commentaries, influencing the subsequent [[Averroism|Averroist]] movement and the writings of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=What the Law Requires Is Written on Their Hearts: Noachic and Natural Law among German-Speakers in Early Modern North America|first=A. G.|last=Roeber|journal=[[William and Mary Quarterly]]|series=Third Series|volume=58|issue=4|date=October 2001|pages=883–912 [887]|doi=10.2307/2674504|jstor=2674504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maturidi]] school, the second largest school of Sunni theology, posits the existence of a form of natural law. [[Abu Mansur al-Maturidi]] stated that the human mind could know of the existence of God and the major forms of 'good' and 'evil' without the help of revelation. Al-Maturidi gives the example of stealing, which is known to be evil by reason alone due to people's working hard for their property. Killing, fornication, and drinking alcohol were all 'evils' the human mind could know of according to al-Maturidi. The concept of ''[[Istislah]]'' in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] bears some similarities to the natural law tradition in the West, as exemplified by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. However, whereas natural law deems good what is self-evidently good, according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person, ''istislah'' calls good whatever is connected to one of five "basic goods". [[Al-Ghazali]] abstracted these "basic goods" from the legal precepts in the Qur'an and Sunnah: they are religion, life, reason, lineage and property. Some add also "honour". [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] also posited that human reason could discern between 'great sins' and good deeds.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Brehon law&lt;!--linked from 'Early Irish law'--&gt;===
Early Irish law, An Senchus Mor (The Great Tradition) mentions in a number of places ''recht aicned'' or natural law. This is a concept predating European legal theory, and reflects a type of law that is universal and may be determined by reason and observation of natural action. Neil McLeod identifies concepts that law must accord with: fír (truth) and dliged (right or entitlement). These two terms occur frequently, though Irish law never strictly defines them. Similarly, the term córus (law in accordance with proper order) occurs in some places, and even in the titles of certain texts. These were two very real concepts to the jurists and the value of a given judgment with respect to them was apparently ascertainable. McLeod has also suggested that most of the specific laws mentioned have passed the test of time and thus their truth has been confirmed, while other provisions are justified in other ways because they are younger and have not been tested over time&lt;ref&gt;Neil McLeod, ''The Concept of Law in Ancient Irish Jurisprudence'', in "Irish Jurist" 17 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The laws were written in the oldest dialect of the Irish language, called Bérla Féini [Bairla-faina], which even at the time was so difficult that persons about to become brehons had to be specially instructed in it, the length of time from beginning to becoming a learned Brehon was usually 20 years. Although under the law any third person could fulfill the duty if both parties agreed, and both were sane.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/ancientlaws01hancuoft&lt;/ref&gt; It has been included in an Ethno-Celtic breakaway subculture, as it has religious undertones and freedom of religious expression allows it to once again be used as a valid system in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/62421128B249FE9480257FC3005C7C67?opendocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824231855/http://www.courts.ie/Courts.ie/Library3.nsf/pagecurrent/62421128B249FE9480257FC3005C7C67?opendocument |archivedate=2017-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, like [[procreation]], are common to other animals, while others, like the pursuit of truth, are inclinations peculiar to the capacities of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;International Theological Commission, [http://www.pathsoflove.com/universal-ethics-natural-law.html ''The Search for Universal Ethics: A New Look at the Natural Law''], n. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

To know what is right, one must use one's reason and apply it to Thomas Aquinas' precepts. This reason is believed to be embodied, in its most abstract form, in the concept of a primary precept: "Good is to be sought, evil avoided."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' I–II, Q. 94, A. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; St. Thomas explains that:
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
there belongs to the natural law, first, certain most general precepts, that are known to all;
      and secondly, certain secondary and more detailed precepts, which are, as it were,
      conclusions following closely from first principles. As to those general principles, the
      natural law, in the abstract, can nowise be blotted out from men's hearts. But it is blotted
      out in the case of a particular action, insofar as reason is hindered from applying the
      general principle to a particular point of practice, on account of concupiscence or some
      other passion, as stated above (77, 2). But as to the other, i.e., the secondary precepts, the
      natural law can be blotted out from the human heart, either by evil persuasions, just as in
      speculative matters errors occur in respect of necessary conclusions; or by vicious customs
      and corrupt habits, as among some men, theft, and even unnatural vices, as the Apostle
      states (Rm. i), were not esteemed sinful.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'' I–II, Q. 94, A. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, while the primary and immediate precepts cannot be "blotted out", the secondary precepts can be. Therefore, for a deontological ethical theory they are open to a surprisingly large amount of interpretation and flexibility. Any rule that helps humanity to live up to the primary or subsidiary precepts can be a secondary precept, for example:
* Drunkenness is wrong because it injures one's health, and worse, destroys one's ability to reason, which is fundamental to humans as rational animals (i.e., does not support self-preservation).
* Theft is wrong because it destroys social relations, and humans are by nature social animals (i.e., does not support the subsidiary precept of living in society).

Natural moral law is concerned with both exterior and interior acts, also known as action and motive. Simply doing the right thing is not enough; to be truly moral one's motive must be right as well. For example, helping an old lady across the road (good exterior act) to impress someone (bad interior act) is wrong. However, good intentions don't always lead to good actions. The motive must coincide with the cardinal or theological virtues. [[Cardinal virtues]] are acquired through reason applied to nature; they are:
# [[Prudence]]
# [[Justice (virtue)|Justice]]
# [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]
# [[Cardinal virtues|Fortitude]]

The [[theological virtues]] are:

# [[Faith in Christianity|Faith]]
# [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]]
# [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]]

According to Aquinas, to lack any of these virtues is to lack the ability to make a moral choice. For example, consider a person who possesses the virtues of justice, prudence, and fortitude, yet lacks temperance. Due to their lack of self-control and desire for pleasure, despite their good intentions, they will find themself swaying from the moral path.

===English jurisprudence===
Heinrich A. Rommen remarked upon "the tenacity with which the spirit of the English common law retained the conceptions of natural law and equity which it had assimilated during the Catholic Middle Ages, thanks especially to the influence of [[Henry de Bracton]] (d. 1268) and [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] (d. cir. 1476)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Heinrich A.|last=Rommen|title=The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social History and Philosophy|others=Trans. and rev.

&lt;/ref&gt; and it was thoroughly annotated by [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullett|first=Charles F.|title=Fundamental Law and the American Revolution, 1760–1776|place=New York|publisher=Octagon Books|origyear=1933|year=1966|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Germain informs his readers that English lawyers generally don't use the phrase "law of nature", but rather use "reason" as the preferred synonym.&lt;ref name="Doctor and Student, bk. 1, ch. 5"&gt;Doctor and Student, bk. 1, ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doe|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Doe|year=1990|title=Fundamental Authority in Late Medieval English Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=112–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman Doe notes that St. Germain's view "is essentially Thomist," quoting Thomas Aquinas's definition of law as "an ordinance of reason made for the common good by him who has charge of the community, and promulgated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doe|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Doe|year=1990|title=Fundamental Authority in Late Medieval English Law|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=113}}, note 23, citing Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa Theologica'', 1a, 2ae, 90, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir Edward Coke was the preeminent jurist of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Coke, ''The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003), vol. 1, p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's preeminence extended across the ocean: "For the American revolutionary leaders, 'law' meant Sir Edward Coke's custom and right reason."&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''In a Defiant Stance: The Conditions of Law in Massachusetts Bay, The Irish Comparison, and the Coming of the American Revolution'' (University Park, Penn.: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1977), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to [[James Madison]] in 1826 that before the Revolution, the first volume of Coke's ''Institutes of the Laws of England'' "was the universal elementary book of law students, and a sounder Whig never wrote, nor of profounder learning in the orthodox doctrines of the British constitution, or in what were called English liberties." See ''The Writings of Thomas Jefferson'', vol. 16, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke defined law as "perfect reason, which commands those things that are proper and necessary and which prohibits contrary things".&lt;ref&gt;John Underwood Lewis, "Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634): His Theory of 'Artificial Reason' as a Context for Modern Basic Legal Theory," in ''Law, Liberty, and Parliament: Selected Essays on the Writings of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Allen D. Boyer (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2004), pp. 108–09; citing Edward Coke, ''First Part of the Institutes'', 319b.&lt;/ref&gt; For Coke, human nature determined the purpose of law; and law was superior to any one person's reason or will.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634): His Theory of 'Artificial Reason' as a Context for Modern Basic Legal Theory", p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Coke's discussion of natural law appears in his report of ''Calvin's Case'' (1608): "The law of nature is that which God at the time of creation of the nature of man infused into his heart, for his preservation and direction." In this case the judges found that "the ligeance or faith of the subject is due unto the King by the law of nature: secondly, that the law of nature is part of the law of England: thirdly, that the law of nature was before any judicial or municipal law: fourthly, that the law of nature is immutable." To support these findings, the assembled judges (as reported by Coke, who was one of them) cited as authorities [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]]; as well as Bracton, Fortescue, and [[Christopher St. Germain|St. Germain]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Edward Coke, ''The Selected Writings and Speeches of Sir Edward Coke'', ed. Steve Sheppard (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003), vol. 1, pp. 195–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Coke, the most famous common law jurist of the seventeenth century is [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Sir Matthew Hale]]. Hale wrote a treatise on natural law that circulated among English lawyers in the eighteenth century and survives in three manuscript copies.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, London, Add. MS 18235, fols. 41–147 [1693]; Harley MS 7159, fols. 1–266 [1696]; Hargrave MS 485 [late-eighteenth century]&lt;/ref&gt; This natural-law treatise has been published as ''Of the Law of Nature'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hale, [http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-nature ''Of the Law of Nature''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514014830/http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-nature |date=2016-05-14 }}, ed. David S. Sytsma (CLP Academic, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Hale's definition of the natural law reads: "It is the Law of Almighty God given by him to Man with his Nature discovering the morall good and moral evill of Moral Actions, commanding the former, and forbidding the latter by the secret voice or dictate of his implanted nature, his reason, and his concience."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 41.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed natural law as antecedent, preparatory, and subsequent to civil government,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 85–106.&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that human law "cannot forbid what the Law of Nature injoins, nor Command what the Law of Nature prohibits."&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 194.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited as authorities [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 41, 52, 64, 150–51.&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of Hobbes's reduction of natural law to self-preservation and Hobbes's account of the state of nature,&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 43, 86, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; but drew positively on  [[Hugo Grotius]]'s ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'', [[Francisco Suárez]]'s ''Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore'', and [[John Selden]]'s ''De jure naturali et gentium juxta disciplinam Ebraeorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, ''Of the Law of Nature'', 7–8, 17, 49, 63, 111–19, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the thirteenth century, it was held that "the law of nature...is the ground of all laws"&lt;ref&gt;8 Edw 4 fol. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Chancellor and Judges that "it is required by the law of nature that every person, before he can be punish'd, ought to be present; and if absent by contumacy, he ought to be summoned and make default".&lt;ref&gt;9 Ed. 4 fol. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fort. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 1824, we find it held that "proceedings in our Courts are founded upon the law of England, and that law is again founded upon the law of nature and the revealed law of God. If the right sought to be enforced is inconsistent with either of these, the English municipal courts cannot recognize it."&lt;ref&gt;2 B. &amp; C. 471&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hobbes====
[[File:Thomas Hobbes.jpeg|thumb|right|190px|Thomas Hobbes]]
By the 17th century, the [[medieval]] [[teleology|teleological]] view came under intense criticism from some quarters. [[Thomas Hobbes]] instead founded a [[social contract|contractarian theory]] of [[legal positivism]] on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another). The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act. Natural law, therefore, was discovered by considering humankind's [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law. In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign. Because the ultimate source of law now comes from the sovereign, and the sovereign's decisions need not be grounded in morality, legal positivism is born. [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s modifications on [[legal positivism]] further developed the theory.

As used by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in his treatises ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and ''[[De Cive]]'', natural law is "a [[precept]], or general rule, found out by [[reason]], by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Leviathan, pt. 1, ch. 14 (p. 64)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hobbes, there are nineteen Laws. The first two are expounded in chapter XIV of Leviathan ("of the first and second natural laws; and of contracts"); the others in chapter XV ("of other laws of nature").
* The first law of nature is ''that every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war''.
* The second law of nature is ''that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far forth, as for peace, and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself.''
* The third law is ''that men perform their covenants made.'' In this law of nature consisteth the fountain and original of justice... when a covenant is made, then to break it is unjust and the definition of injustice is no other than the not performance of covenant. And whatsoever is not unjust is just.
* The fourth law is ''that a man which receiveth benefit from another of mere grace, endeavour that he which giveth it, have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good will.'' Breach of this law is called ingratitude.
* The fifth law is complaisance: ''that every man strive to accommodate himself to the rest.'' The observers of this law may be called sociable; the contrary, stubborn, insociable, forward, intractable.
* The sixth law is ''that upon caution of the future time, a man ought to pardon the offences past of them that repenting, desire it.''
* The seventh law is ''that in revenges, men look not at the greatness of the evil past, but the greatness of the good to follow.''
* The eighth law is ''that no man by deed, word, countenance, or gesture, declare hatred or contempt of another.'' The breach of which law is commonly called contumely.
* The ninth law is ''that every man acknowledge another for his equal by nature.'' The breach of this precept is pride.
* The tenth law is ''that at the entrance into the conditions of peace, no man require to reserve to himself any right, which he is not content should be reserved to every one of the rest.'' The breach of this precept is arrogance, and observers of the precept are called modest.
* The eleventh law is that ''if a man be trusted to judge between man and man, that he deal equally between them.''
* The twelfth law is ''that such things as cannot be divided, be enjoyed in common, if it can be; and if the quantity of the thing permit, without stint; otherwise proportionably to the number of them that have right.''
* The thirteenth law is ''the entire right, or else...the first possession'' (in the case of alternating use), of a thing that ''can neither be divided nor enjoyed in common'' should be determined by lottery.
* The fourteenth law is that ''those things which cannot be enjoyed in common, nor divided, ought to be adjudged to the first possessor; and in some cases to the first born, as acquired by lot.''
* The fifteenth law is that ''all men that mediate peace be allowed safe conduct.''
* The sixteenth law is ''that they that are at controversie, submit their Right to the judgement of an Arbitrator.''
* The seventeenth law is ''that no man is a fit Arbitrator in his own cause.''
* The eighteenth law is that no man should serve as a judge in a case if ''greater profit, or honour, or pleasure apparently ariseth [for him] out of the victory of one party, than of the other.''
* The nineteenth law is that in a disagreement of fact, the judge should not give more weight to the testimony of one party than another, and absent other evidence, should give credit to the testimony of other witnesses.

Hobbes's philosophy includes a frontal assault on the founding principles of the earlier natural legal tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern: Classical Republicanism and the American Revolution'' (Chapel Hill, 1992), pp. 372–73&lt;/ref&gt; disregarding the traditional association of virtue with happiness,&lt;ref&gt;A Hobbes Dictionary: {{cite web |url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631192626_chunk_g978063119262612_ss1-2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111140201/http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631192626_chunk_g978063119262612_ss1-2 |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise re-defining "law" to remove any notion of the promotion of the common good.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Stoner, Jr., ''Common Law and Liberal Theory: Coke, Hobbes, and the Origins of American Constitutionalism'' (Lawrence, Kansas, 1992), 71; see also John Phillip Reid, "In the Taught Tradition: The Meaning of Law in Massachusetts-Bay Two-Hundred Years Ago," ''Suffolk University Law Review'' 14 (1980), 938–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes has no use for [[Aristotle]]'s association of nature with human perfection, inverting Aristotle's use of the word "nature." Hobbes posits a primitive, unconnected state of nature in which men, having a "natural proclivity...to hurt each other" also have "a Right to every thing, even to one anothers body";&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''De Cive (The Citizen)'', ed. Sterling P. Lamprecht (New York, 1949; orig. 1642), ch. 2, sec. 2 (p. 29).&lt;/ref&gt; and "nothing can be Unjust" in this "warre of every man against every man" in which human life is "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes, ''Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, &amp; Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civill'' (Mineola, N.Y., 2006; orig. 1651), pt. 1, ch. 14 (p. 72); p. 1, ch. 13 (pp. 21, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting [[Cicero]]'s view that people join in society primarily through "a certain social spirit which nature has implanted in man,"&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De re publica'' (Keyes translation), bk. 1, ch. 25, sec. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes declares that men join in society simply for the purpose of "getting themselves out from that miserable condition of Warre, which is necessarily consequent...to the naturall Passions of men, when there is no visible Power to keep them in awe."&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', pt. 2, ch. 17 (p. 93)&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his campaign against the classical idea of natural human sociability, Hobbes inverts that fundamental natural legal maxim, the Golden Rule. Hobbes's version is ''"Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thy selfe."''&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, ''Leviathan'', pt. 1, ch. 15 (p. 79)(emphasis in original). See also Rahe, ''Republics Ancient and Modern'', p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cumberland's rebuttal of Hobbes====
The English cleric [[Richard Cumberland (philosopher)|Richard Cumberland]] wrote a lengthy and influential attack on Hobbes's depiction of individual self-interest as the essential feature of human motivation. Historian Knud Haakonssen has noted that in the eighteenth century, Cumberland was commonly placed alongside [[Alberico Gentili]], [[Hugo Grotius]] and [[Samuel Pufendorf]] "in the triumvirate of seventeenth-century founders of the 'modern' school of natural law."&lt;ref&gt;Knud Haakonssen, "The Character and Obligation of Natural Law according to Richard Cumberland," in ''English Philosophy in the Age of Locke'', ed. M.A. Stewart (Oxford, 2000), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The eighteenth-century philosophers [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Hutcheson]] "were obviously inspired in part by Cumberland."&lt;ref&gt;Haakonssen, ''Natural Law and Moral Philosophy: From Grotius to the Scottish Enlightenment'' (Cambridge, 1996), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Jon Parkin likewise describes Cumberland's work as "one of the most important works of ethical and political theory of the seventeenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Jon Parkin, ''Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's'' De Legibus Naturae (Bury St. Edmunds, United Kingdom, 1999), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Parkin observes that much of Cumberland's material "is derived from Roman [[Stoicism]], particularly from the work of [[Cicero]], as "Cumberland deliberately cast his engagement with Hobbes in the mould of Cicero's debate between the Stoics, who believed that nature could provide an objective morality, and [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]], who argued that morality was human, conventional and self-interested."&lt;ref&gt;Parkin, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Cumberland de-emphasized the overlay of Christian dogma (in particular, the doctrine of "original sin" and the corresponding presumption that humans are incapable of "perfecting" themselves without divine intervention) that had accreted to natural law in the Middle Ages.

By way of contrast to Hobbes's multiplicity of laws, Cumberland states in the very first sentence of his ''Treatise of the Laws of Nature'' that "all the Laws of Nature are reduc'd to that one, of Benevolence toward all Rationals."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cumberland, ''A Treatise of the Laws of Nature'', trans. John Maxwell (Indianapolis, 2005; orig. 1727), "Contents" (p. 237). Cumberland's treatise was originally published in Latin in 1672. A Latin edition was published in Germany in 1684.&lt;/ref&gt; He later clarifies: "By the name ''Rationals'' I beg leave to understand, as well ''God'' as ''Man''; and I do it upon the Authority of Cicero." Cumberland argues that the mature development ("perfection") of human nature involves the individual human willing and acting for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 1, sec. 33 (p. 356)&lt;/ref&gt; For Cumberland, human interdependence precludes Hobbes's natural right of each individual to wage war against all the rest for personal survival. However, Haakonssen warns against reading Cumberland as a proponent of "[[enlightened self-interest]]." Rather, the "proper moral love of humanity" is "a disinterested love of God through love of humanity in ourselves as well as others."&lt;ref&gt;Haakonssen, "The Character and Obligation of Natural Law according to Richard Cumberland," pp. 34, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland concludes that actions "principally conducive to our Happiness" are those that promote "the Honour and Glory of God" and also "Charity and Justice towards men."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 13 (pp. 523–24).&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland emphasizes that desiring the well-being of our fellow humans is essential to the "pursuit of our own Happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 12 (p. 525)&lt;/ref&gt; He cites "reason" as the authority for his conclusion that happiness consists in "the most extensive Benevolence," but he also mentions as "Essential Ingredients of Happiness" the "Benevolent Affections," meaning "Love and Benevolence towards others," as well as "that Joy, which arises from their Happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, ch. 5, sec. 15 (pp. 527–28).&lt;/ref&gt;

====American jurisprudence====
The [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]] states that it has become necessary for the people of the United States to assume "the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them". Some early American lawyers and judges perceived natural law as too tenuous, amorphous, and evanescent a legal basis for grounding concrete [[rights]] and [[Limited government|governmental limitations]].&lt;ref name=Edlin&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1057/palgrave.polity.2300065 |title=Judicial Review without a Constitution |author=Douglas E.

===European liberal natural law===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2009}}
[[File:Dr Sir Albericus Gentilis (Father of international law).png|thumb|190px|[[Alberico Gentili|Dr Alberico Gentili]], the founder of the science of international law.]]
Liberal natural law grew out of the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Christian natural law theories and out of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] revision of natural law, sometimes in an uneasy balance of the two.

[[Alberico Gentili|Sir Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] based their philosophies of international law on natural law. In particular, his writings on [[freedom of the seas]] and [[just war theory]] directly appealed to natural law. About natural law itself, he wrote that "even the will of an [[omnipotent]] being cannot change or abrogate" natural law, which "would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no [[God]] or that he does not care for human affairs." (''[[De iure belli ac pacis]]'', Prolegomeni XI). This is the famous [[argument]] ''etiamsi daremus'' (''non esse Deum''), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology. However, German church-historians Ernst Wolf and M. Elze disagreed and claimed that Grotius' concept of natural law did have a theological basis.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Wolf, ''Naturrecht'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band IV (1960), Tübingen (Germany), col. 1357&lt;/ref&gt; In Grotius' view, the [[Old Testament]] contained moral precepts (e.g. the [[Decalogue]]) which [[Christ]] confirmed and therefore were still valid. Moreover, they were useful in explaining the content of natural law. Both biblical revelation and natural law originated in God and could therefore not contradict each other.&lt;ref&gt;M. Elze, ''Grotius, Hugo'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band II (1958), col. 1885&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar way, [[Samuel Pufendorf]] gave natural law a theological foundation and applied it to his concepts of government and [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Hohlwein, ''Pufendorf, Samuel Freiherr von'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band V (1961), col. 721&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Locke]] incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. There is considerable debate about whether his conception of natural law was more akin to that of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] (filtered through [[Richard Hooker]]) or [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes']] radical reinterpretation, though the effect of Locke's understanding is usually phrased in terms of a revision of Hobbes upon Hobbesian [[social contract|contractarian]] grounds. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect "life, liberty, and property," people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, ''Two Treatises of Government'', Second Treatise, Chapter 13, §149&lt;/ref&gt;

While Locke spoke in the language of natural law, the content of this law was by and large protective of [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]], and it was this language that later liberal thinkers preferred. Political philosopher [[Jeremy Waldron]] has pointed out that Locke's political thought was based on "a particular set of Protestant Christian assumptions."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron (2002), ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought''. Cambridge University Press, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; To Locke, the content of natural law was identical with biblical ethics as laid down especially in the [[Decalogue]], [[Christ]]'s teaching and exemplary life, and St. Paul's admonitions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', pp. 12–15, 45–46, 95–97, 195–98, 230&lt;/ref&gt; Locke derived the concept of basic human equality, including the [[equality of the sexes]] ("Adam and Eve"), from [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/? Genesis 1, 26–28], the starting-point of the theological doctrine of [[Imago Dei]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', pp. 21–43&lt;/ref&gt; One of the consequences is that as all humans are created equally free, governments need the consent of the governed.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Waldron, ''God, Locke, and Equality'', p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]], arguably echoing Locke, appealed to [[inalienable rights|unalienable rights]] in the ''[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are ''created'' equal, that they are endowed by their ''Creator'' with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1988), 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lockean idea that governments need the [[consent of the governed]] was also fundamental to the Declaration of Independence, as the American Revolutionaries used it as justification for their separation from the British crown.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005),''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-531588-2}}, pp. 49–52, 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belgian philosopher of law [[Frank van Dun]] is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213180721/http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/Texts/Logica/NaturalLaw.htm |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of natural law in the liberal tradition. [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] theorist [[Murray Rothbard]] argues that "the very existence of a natural law discoverable by reason is a potentially powerful threat to the status quo and a standing reproach to the reign of blindly traditional custom or the arbitrary will of the State apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ethics of Liberty|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics.pdf|chapter=Natural Law Versus Positive Law|pages=17|author=Rothbard, Murray|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126063000/http://mises.org/rothbard/ethics.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Mises]] states that he relaid the general sociological and economic foundations of the liberal doctrine upon utilitarianism, rather than natural law, but R.

Economist and philosopher [[Friedrich Hayek|F. A. Hayek]] said that, originally, "the term 'natural' was used to describe an orderliness or regularity that was not the product of deliberate human will. Together with 'organism' it was one of the two terms generally understood to refer to the spontaneously grown in contrast to the invented or designed. Its use in this sense had been inherited from the stoic philosophy, had been revived in the twelfth century, and it was finally under its flag that the late Spanish Schoolmen developed the foundations of the genesis and functioning of spontaneously formed social institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=97–98|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that 'natural' was "the product of designing reason" is a product of a seventeenth century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] reinterpretation of the law of nature. [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]], for example, when referred to the 'natural' price, explained that it is "so called because 'it results from the thing itself without regard to laws and decrees, but is dependent on many circumstances which alter it, such as the sentiments of men, their estimation of different uses, often even in consequence of whims and pleasures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/lllfh.pdf|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1973, 1976, 1979, 1982|isbn=0-415-09868-8|location=London|pages=21|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008175341/http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/lllfh.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And even [[John Locke]], when talking about the foundations of natural law and explaining what he thought when citing "reason", said: "By reason, however, I do not think is meant here that faculty of the understanding which forms traint of thought and deduces proofs, but certain definite principles of action from which spring all virtues and whatever is necessary for the proper moulding of morals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays Concerning the Law of Nature|last=Locke|first=John|publisher=W. von Leyden|year=1954|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This anti-rationalist approach to human affairs, for Hayek, was the same which guided [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish enlightenment]] thinkers, such as [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Ferguson]], to make their case for liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies in Philosophy, Politics and Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=98–99|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For them, no one can have the knowledge necessary to plan society, and this "natural" or "spontaneous" order of society shows how it can efficiently "plan" bottom-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://tmtfree.hd.free.fr/albums/files/TMTisFree/Documents/Economy/libertarianismo/fahttet.pdf|title=The Trend of Economic Thinking|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=22–24|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829053955/http://tmtfree.hd.free.fr/albums/files/TMTisFree/Documents/Economy/libertarianismo/fahttet.pdf|archivedate=2016-08-29|df=|access-date=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the idea that law is just a product of deliberate design, denied by natural law and linked to [[legal positivism]], can easily generate [[totalitarianism]]: "If law is wholly the product of deliberate design, whatever the designer decrees to be law is just by definition and unjust law becomes a contradiction in terms. The will of the duly authorized legislator is then wholly unfettered and guided solely by his concrete interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/tcolfh.pdf|title=The Constitution of Liberty|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=|pages=238–39|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926153103/http://www.libertarianismo.org/livros/tcolfh.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is wrong because law cannot be just a product of "reason": "no system of articulated law can be applied except within a framework of generally recognized but often unarticulated rules of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|title=Studies In Philosophy, Politics And Economics|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=102|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011181044/https://direitasja.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/studies-in-philosophy-and-economics-friedrich-a-hayek.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a secular critique of the natural law doctrine was stated by [[Pierre Charron]] in his ''De la sagesse'' (1601): "The sign of a natural law must be the universal respect in which it is held, for if there was anything that nature had truly commanded us to do, we would undoubtedly obey it universally: not only would every nation respect it, but every individual. Instead there is nothing in the world that is not subject to contradiction and dispute, nothing that is not rejected, not just by one nation, but by many; equally, there is nothing that is strange and (in the opinion of many) unnatural that is not approved in many countries, and authorized by their customs."

==Contemporary jurisprudence==

In [[jurisprudence]], ''natural law'' can refer to the several doctrines:
* That [[justice|just laws]] are [[Immanence|immanent]] in nature; that is, they can be "discovered" or "found" but not "created" by such things as a [[bill of rights]];
* That they can emerge by the natural process of resolving conflicts, as embodied by the evolutionary process of the common law; or
* That the meaning of law is such that its content cannot be determined except by reference to moral principles. These meanings can either oppose or complement each other, although they share the common trait that they rely on inherence as opposed to design in finding just laws.

Whereas [[legal positivism]] would say that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence would say that there is something legally deficient about an unjust norm. [[Legal interpretivism]], famously defended in the English-speaking world by [[Ronald Dworkin]], claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism.

Besides [[utilitarianism]] and [[Kantianism]], natural law jurisprudence has in common with [[virtue ethics]] that it is a live option for a [[first principles]] ethics theory in [[analytic philosophy]].

The concept of natural law was very important in the development of the English [[common law]]. In the struggles between [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and the [[British monarchy|monarch]], Parliament often made reference to the [[Fundamental Laws of England]], which were at times said to embody natural law principles since [[time immemorial]] and set limits on the power of the monarchy. According to [[William Blackstone]], however, natural law might be useful in determining the content of the common law and in deciding cases of [[Equity (law)|equity]], but was not itself identical with the laws of England. Nonetheless, the implication of natural law in the common law tradition has meant that the great opponents of natural law and advocates of [[legal positivism]], like [[Jeremy Bentham]], have also been staunch critics of the common law.

Natural law jurisprudence is currently undergoing a period of reformulation (as is legal positivism). The most prominent contemporary natural law jurist, Australian [[John Finnis]], is based in Oxford, but there are also Americans [[Germain Grisez]], [[Robert P. George]], and Canadian [[Joseph Boyle (jurist)|Joseph Boyle]] and Brazilian Emídio Brasileiro. All have tried to construct a new version of natural law. The 19th-century [[anarchism|anarchist]] and legal theorist, [[Lysander Spooner]], was also a figure in the expression of modern natural law.

"New Natural Law" as it is sometimes called, originated with Grisez. It focuses on "basic human goods", such as human life, knowledge, and aesthetic experience, which are [[Self-evidence|self-evidently]] and intrinsically worthwhile, and states that these goods reveal themselves as being [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]] with one another.

The tensions between the natural law and the positive law have played, and continue to play a key role in the development of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Prabhakar Singh, "From 'narcissistic' positive international law to 'universal' natural international law: the dialectics of 'absentee colonialism'", ''African Journal of International and Comparative Law'', 2008, 16(1), 56–82&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Madrid Seismic Zone''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|d|r|ɪ|d}}), sometimes called the '''New Madrid Fault Line''', is a major [[seismic zone]] and a prolific source of [[intraplate earthquake]]s (earthquakes within a [[tectonic plate]]) in the [[Southern United States|southern]] and [[midwestern United States]], stretching to the southwest from [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], [[Missouri]].

The New Madrid fault system was responsible for the [[1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes]] and has the potential to produce large [[earthquake]]s in the future. Since 1812, frequent smaller earthquakes have been recorded in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/ceri/public/history.php|title=Center for Earthquake Research and Information at the University of Memphis|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Mimphis|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquakes that occur in the New Madrid Seismic Zone potentially threaten parts of eight American states: [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Missouri]], [[Arkansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Oklahoma]] and [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/on-shaky-ground/Content?oid=2492565|title=On Shaky Ground|last=Stelzer|first=C. D.|date=December 15, 1999|website=Riverfront Times|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}}-long seismic zone, which extends into five states, stretches southward from [[Cairo, Illinois]]; through [[Hayti, Missouri|Hayti]], [[Caruthersville, Missouri|Caruthersville]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]] in [[Missouri]]; through [[Blytheville, Arkansas|Blytheville]] into [[Marked Tree, Arkansas|Marked Tree]] in [[Arkansas]]. It also covers a part of [[West Tennessee]], near [[Reelfoot Lake]], extending southeast into [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]. It is southwest of the [[Wabash Valley Seismic Zone]].

Most of the [[seismicity]] originates between {{convert|3|and|15|mi|km}} beneath the Earth's surface.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Earthquake history==
The zone had four of the largest North American earthquakes in recorded history, with moment magnitudes estimated to be as large as 7.0 or greater, all occurring within a three-month period between December 1811 and February 1812. Many of the published accounts describe the cumulative effects of all the earthquakes (known as the New Madrid Sequence); thus finding the individual effects of each quake can be difficult. Magnitude estimates and epicenters are based on interpretations of historical accounts and may vary.

===Prehistoric earthquakes===

Because uplift rates associated with large New Madrid earthquakes could not have occurred continuously over geological timescales without dramatically altering the local topography, studies have concluded that the seismic activity there cannot have gone on for longer than 64,000 years, making the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) a young feature, or that earthquakes and the associated uplift migrate around the area over time, or that the NMSZ has short periods of activity interspersed with long periods of quiescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Thomas L|date=April–June 1994|title=How old is the New Madrid Seismic Zone?|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/tpratt/publications/Pratt_SRL_94.pdf|journal=Seismological Research Letters|volume=65|issue=2|pages=|doi=10.1785/gssrl.65.2.172|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210144437/http://faculty.washington.edu/tpratt/publications/Pratt_SRL_94.pdf|archive-date=December 10, 2013|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeological studies have found from studies of [[Sand volcano|sand blows]] and soil horizons that previous series of very large earthquakes have occurred in the NMSZ in recent prehistory.

[[Dendrochronology]] (tree ring) studies conducted on the oldest [[bald cypress]] trees growing in [[Reelfoot Lake]] found evidence of the 1811–1812 series in the form of fractures followed by rapid growth after their inundation, whereas cores taken from old bald cypress trees in the St. Francis sunklands showed slowed growth in the half century that followed 1812. These were interpreted as clear signals of the 1811–1812 earthquake series in tree rings. Because the tree ring record in Reelfoot Lake and the St. Francis sunk lands extend back to AD 1682 and AD 1321, respectively, Van Arsdale et al. interpreted the lack of similar signals elsewhere in the chronology as evidence against large New Madrid earthquakes between those years and 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Earthquake signals in tree-ring data from the New Madrid seismic zone and implications for paleoseismicity |first=RB |last=Van Arsdale |first2=DW |last2=Stahle |author3=MK Cleaveland |author4=MJ Guccione |journal=Geology |date=June 1998 |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=515–518 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1998)026&lt;0515:ESITRD&gt;2.3.CO;2 |bibcode = 1998Geo....26..515V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known written record of an earthquake felt in the NMSZ was from a French missionary traveling up the Mississippi with a party of explorers. At 1 pm on [[Christmas Day]] 1699, at a site near the present-day location of Memphis, the party was startled by a short period of ground shaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OB75l5upMJQC&amp;vq|title=When the Mississippi Ran Backwards : Empire, Intrigue, Murder, and the New Madrid Earthquakes|last=Feldman|first=Jay|publisher=Free Press|year=2005|isbn=0-7432-4278-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1812–1900===
Hundreds of aftershocks of the 1811–1812 series followed over a period of several years. Aftershocks strong enough to be felt occurred until 1817.  The largest earthquakes to have occurred since then were on January 4, 1843, and October 31, 1895, with magnitude estimates of 6.0 and 6.6, respectively. The 1895 had its epicenter near [[Charleston, Missouri]]. The quake damaged virtually all the buildings in Charleston, created [[sand volcano]]es by the city, cracked a pier on the [[Cairo Rail Bridge]] and toppled chimneys in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]; [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Gadsden, Alabama]]; and [[Evansville, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historic Earthquakes: Near Charleston, Mississippi County, Missouri |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1895_10_31.php |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=23 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707135000/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1895_10_31.php |archivedate=7 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern activity===
The largest NMSZ earthquake of the 20th century was [[1968 Illinois earthquake|a 5.4-magnitude quake]] (although it was reported as a 5.5 at the time) on November 9, 1968, near [[Dale, Illinois]]. The quake damaged the civic building at [[Henderson, Kentucky]] and was felt in 23 states.  People in [[Boston]] said their buildings swayed. At the time of the quake, it was the biggest recorded quake with an epicenter in Illinois in that state's recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Quakes: Southern Illinois 1968 11 09 17:01:40.5 UTC|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/events/1968_11_09.php|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=23 September 2009|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708185537/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/events/1968_11_09.php|archivedate=8 July 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 in the nearby [[Wabash Valley Seismic Zone]], a similar [[2008 Illinois earthquake|magnitude 5.4 earthquake]] occurred with its epicenter in Illinois near [[West Salem, Illinois|West Salem]] and [[Mount Carmel, Illinois|Mount Carmel]].

Instruments were installed in and around the area in 1974 to closely monitor seismic activity. Since then, more than 4,000 earthquakes have been recorded, most of which were too small to be felt. On average, one earthquake per year is large enough to be felt in the area.

==Geology==
[[File:Reelfoot Rift diagram from USGS en.svg|thumb|left|287px|Geological structure of [[Reelfoot Rift]]]]

The [[Fault (geology)|faults]] responsible for the New Madrid Seismic Zone are embedded in a subsurface geological feature known as the [[Reelfoot Rift]] that formed during the breakup of the [[supercontinent]] [[Rodinia]] in the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[Era (geology)|Era]] (about 750 million years ago). The resulting [[rift]] system failed to split the continent, but has remained as an [[aulacogen]] (a scar or zone of weakness) deep underground, and its ancient faults appear to have made the Earth's crust in the New Madrid area mechanically weaker than much of the rest of North America.

This relative weakness is important, because it would allow the relatively small east-west compressive forces associated with the continuing [[continental drift]] of the North American plate to reactivate old faults around New Madrid, making the area unusually prone to earthquakes in spite of it being far from the nearest tectonic plate boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/2003/eq_030606/|title=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, Earthquake Report: Kentucky|last=|first=|date=June 6, 2003|website=National Earthquake Information Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420141846/http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/eq_depot/2003/eq_030606/|archive-date=April 20, 2006|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since other ancient rifts are known to occur in North America but not all are associated with modern earthquakes, other processes could be at work to locally increase mechanical stress on the New Madrid faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Did deglaciation trigger intraplate seismicity in the New Madrid seismic zone? |first=Balz |last=Grollimund |first2=Mark D. |last2=Zoback |journal=Geology |date=February 2001 |volume=29  |issue=2 |pages=175–178 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029&lt;0175:DDTISI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 2001Geo....29..175G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Sinking Mafic Body in a Reactivated Lower Crust: A Mechanism for Stress Concentration at the New Madrid Seismic Zone |first=Fred F. |last=Pollitz |first2=Louise |last2=Kellogg |first3=Roland |last3=Bürgmann |journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America |date=December 2001 |volume=91 |issue=6 |pages=1882–1897 |doi=10.1785/0120000277 |bibcode = 2001BuSSA..91.1882P |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1235774/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that some form of heating in the lithosphere below the area may be making deep rocks more plastic, which would concentrate compressive stress in the shallower subsurface area where the faulting occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Liu |first=L. |first2=M.

==Potential for future earthquakes==

In a report filed in November 2008, the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] warned that a serious earthquake in the New Madrid Seismic Zone could result in "the highest economic losses due to a natural disaster in the United States," further predicting "widespread and catastrophic" damage across Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, and particularly Tennessee, where a 7.7 magnitude quake would cause damage to tens of thousands of structures affecting [[Water purification|water distribution]], [[transportation|transportation systems]], and other vital [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-earthquake-study/government-warns-of-catastrophic-u-s-quake-idUSTRE4AJ9EV20081120|title=Government warns of "catastrophic" U.S. quake|last=|first=|date=November 20, 2008|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earthquake is expected to also result in many thousands of fatalities, with more than 4,000 of the fatalities expected in Memphis alone.

&lt;!--According to an unattributed report carried by the ''Virtual Times'', an 8.0 earthquake on the New Madrid Fault would destroy 60 percent of Memphis, killing thousands and causing over $50 billion in property damage in the city alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsv.com/genlintr/newmadrd/ "The Virtual Times: The New Madrid Earthquake"&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;The potential for the recurrence of large earthquakes and their impact today on densely populated cities in and around the seismic zone has generated much research devoted to understanding in the New Madrid Seismic Zone. By studying evidence of past quakes and closely monitoring ground motion and current earthquake activity, scientists attempt to understand their causes and recurrence intervals.

In October 2009, a team composed of [[University of Illinois]] and [[Virginia Tech]] researchers headed by Amr S. Elnashai, funded by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), considered a scenario where all three segments of the New Madrid fault ruptured simultaneously with a total earthquake magnitude of 7.7. The report found that there would be significant damage in the eight states studied – [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], and [[Tennessee]] – with the probability of additional damage in states farther from the NMSZ. Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri would be most severely impacted, and the cities of [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri]] would be severely damaged.  The report estimated 86,000 casualties, including 3,500 fatalities; 715,000 damaged buildings; and 7.2 million people displaced, with 2 million of those seeking shelter, primarily due to the lack of utility services.  Direct economic losses, according to the report, would be at least $300 billion.&lt;ref name="Elnashai 2009"&gt;[https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/14810 "Impact of New Madrid Seismic Zone Earthquakes on the Central USA"] Mid-American Earthquake Center Report 09-03.

===Iben Browning's 1990 prediction===

Beginning in February 1989, climatologist [[Iben Browning]] – who claimed to have predicted the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] and the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] – predicted that there was a 50 percent probability of a magnitude 6.5 to 7.5 earthquake in the New Madrid area sometime between December 1 and December 5, 1990.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news | author=Fowler, Glenn| title=Iben Browning, 73; Researcher Studied Climate and Quakes | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/20/obituaries/iben-browning-73-researcher-studied-climate-and-quakes.html?scp=1&amp;sq=iben%20browning&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | date=July 20, 1991 | accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS Circular 1083"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Spence, William J. |author2=Herrmann, R.

The period passed with no major earthquake activity in New Madrid or along the {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} fault line.&lt;ref name="USGS Circular 1083"/&gt;

===Uncertainty over recurrence potential===
The lack of apparent land movement along the New Madrid fault system has long puzzled scientists. In 2009, two studies based on eight years of GPS measurements indicated that the faults were moving at no more than {{convert|0.2|mm|in|sp=us}} a year.&lt;ref name="Shutting Down"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/news156169464.html|title=New Madrid fault system may be shutting down|last=Gardner|first=Elizabeth K.|date=2009|work=|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts to the rate of slip on the [[San Andreas Fault]], which averages up to {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}} a year across California.&lt;ref name="Cyclic Deformation"&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1990/1515/ Thatcher, Wayne "Present-Day Crustal Movements and the Mechanics of Cyclic Deformation"] in "The San Andreas Fault System, California." USGS Professional Paper 1515. Robert E. Wallace, editor. 1990. Retrieved 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2009, a research group based out of [[Northwestern University]] and [[Purdue University]], funded by the [[United States Geological Survey]], reported in the journal [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] and in other journals that the New Madrid system may be "shutting down" and that tectonic stress may now be accumulating elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Shutting Down"/&gt; Seth Stein, the leader of the research group, published these views in a book, ''Disaster Deferred'', in 2008.  Although some of these ideas have gained some amount of acceptance among researchers, they have not been accepted by the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council, which advises the [[USGS]].&lt;ref&gt;Monastersky, Richard. [http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111109/full/479166a.html "Nature News: Seth Stein: The Quake Killer"] ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (9 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 5, 2009, issue of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', researchers from [[Northwestern University]] and the [[University of Missouri]] said that due to the lack of fault movement, the quakes along the faults may only be [[aftershock]]s of the 1811–1812 earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Earthquakes Actually Aftershocks Of 19th Century Quakes; Repercussions Of 1811 And 1812 New Madrid Quakes Continue To Be Felt |url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091104132652.htm |publisher=[[Science Daily]] |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the USGS, there is a broad consensus that the possibility of major earthquakes in the New Madrid Seismic Zone remains a concern, and that the GPS data do not provide a compelling case for lessening perceived earthquake hazards in the region. One concern is that the small earthquakes that still happen are not diminishing over time, as would be if they were aftershocks of the 1811–1812 events; another is that the 4,500-year archaeological record of large earthquakes in the region is more significant than ten years of direct strain measurement. The USGS issued a fact sheet in 2009 stating the estimate of a 7–10% chance of a New Madrid earthquake of magnitude comparable to one of the 1811–1812 quakes within the next 50 years, and a 25–40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 earthquake in the same time frame.&lt;ref name="USGS Factsheet 2009"&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2009/3071/pdf/FS09-3071.pdf Earthquake Hazard in the New Madrid Seismic Zone Remains a Concern USGS (2009).] Retrieved 12/6/13&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, the USGS increased the risk assessment for the New Madrid area.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, Mark D.; Moschetti, Morgan P.'; Powers, Peter M.' et al.

'''Nyai Loro Kidul''' (also spelled ''Nyi Roro Kidul'') is an Indonesian goddess of the sea. She is the Queen of the Southern Sea ([[Indian Ocean]]) in [[Javanese mythology|Javanese]] and [[Sundanese people#Religion|Sundanese]] mythology.

According to [[Javanese beliefs]], she is also the mythical spiritual consort of the Sultans of [[Mataram Sultanate|Mataram]] and [[Sultanate of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], beginning with [[Senopati]] and continuing to the present day.

==Names==
Nyai Roro Kidul spirit has many different names, which reflect the diverse stories of her origin in different sagas, legends, myths and traditional [[folklore]]. The [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] folk tale tells of '''Dewi Kandita''' or '''Kadita''', the beautiful daughter of the [[Sunda Kingdom]] in [[West Java]], refer to '''Ratu Laut Selatan'''.
Other names include '''Ratu Laut Selatan''' ("Queen of the South Sea," meaning the [[Indian Ocean]]) is '''Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Kidul'''&lt;ref&gt;[Indonesian Mystery Poem honoring Nyi Roro Kidul Kanjeng Ratu Kidul]&lt;/ref&gt;. Refer to the royal house of [[Keraton]] [[Surakarta]] revered her as '''Kanjeng Ratu Ayu Kencono Sari'''.&lt;ref&gt;Karaton Surakarta, Yayasan Pawiyatan Kabudayaan Karaton Surakarta, Sekilas Sejarah Keraton Surakarta, R.Ay. Sri Winarti P, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Javanese people|Javanese]] believe it is important to use various [[honorific]]s when referring to her, such as ''Nyai'', ''Kanjeng'', and ''Gusti''. People who invoke her also call her ''Eyang'' (grandmother). In [[mermaid]] form she is referred to as ''Nyai Blorong''.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, Stuart. The Kraton, KITLV Press 2003, Leiden, {{ISBN|90-6718-131-5}}, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

The Javanese word '''loro''' literally means ''two – 2'' and merged into the name of the myth about the Spirit-Queen born as a beautiful girl or maiden, in Old Javanese '''rara''', written as '''rårå''', (also used as ''roro''). Old-Javanese '''rara''' evolved into the New Javanese '''lara''', written as '''lårå''', (means ''ill'', also ''grief'' like heartache, heart-break).

Dutch orthography changed '''lara''' into ''loro'' (used here in Nyai Loro Kidul) so the word play moved from '' beautiful girl'' to a ''sick one'' –  Old Javanese '''Nyi Rara''' and the New Javanese '''Nyai Lara'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jordaan, Roy E. ''Tara and Nyai Lara Kidul ''- Asian Folklore Studies, Volume 56, 1997: pp 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Nyai Loro Kidul is often illustrated as a [[mermaid]] with a tail as well as the lower body parts of a fish. The mythical creature is claimed to be able to take the soul of any who she wished for.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Judith. Die Meereskönigin des Südens, Ratu Kidul. pp 142, Nyi Blorong, die Schlangenfrau – {{ISBN|3-496-02657-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to local popular beliefs around coastal villages on Southern Java, the Queen often claim lives of fishermen or visitors that bathe on the beach, and she usually prefers handsome young men.  

The role of Nyai Loro Kidul as a Javanese Spirit-Queen became a popular motif in traditional Javanese folklore and palace mythologies, as well as being tied in with the beauty of Sundanese and Javanese princesses. Another aspect of her mythology was her ability to change shape several times a day.&lt;ref&gt;Bogaerts, Els. Scription Van sunans, sultans en sultanes; Ratu Kidul in the Panitik Sultan Agungan – M.A. Thesis, Rijskuniversiteit Leiden, Holland&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] of Yogyakarta described his experience on spiritual encounters with the spirit Queen in his memoire; the queen could change shapes and appearance, as a beautiful young woman usually during full moon, and appear as an old woman at other times.&lt;ref&gt;Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX memoire "Takhta untuk Rakyat"&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyai Loro Kidul in a significant amount of the folklore that surrounds her – is in control of the violent waves of the [[Indian Ocean]] from her dwelling place in the heart of the ocean. Sometimes she is referred as one of the spiritual queens or wives of the [[Susuhunan]] of Solo or [[Surakarta]] and the [[Sultan]] of [[Yogyakarta]]. Her literal positioning is considered as corresponding to the [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]]-[[Kraton (Indonesia)|Kraton]]-[[Indian Ocean|South Sea]] axis in the Solo [[Sultanate]] and Yogyakarta Sultanate.

Another pervasive part of folklore surrounding her is the colour of aqua green, ''gadhung m'lathi'' in Javanese, is favoured and referred to her, which is forbidden to wear along the south-coast of Java.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, Stuart. The Kraton, KITLV Press 2003, Leiden , {{ISBN|90-6718-131-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often describes wearing clothes or ''selendang'' (silky sashes) in this color.

==Origin and history==
Although her legends are mostly linked to the 16th century Javanese [[Mataram Sultanate]], the older manuscript traced her legendary origin to the era of the [[Kingdom of Sunda|Sundanese kingdom]] of [[Padjajaran]] and the legend of the ill-fated princess Kadita. However, Javanese and Sundanese anthropological and cultural studies suggest that the myth of the Queen of Java's Southern Seas probably originated from older prehistoric [[animism|animistic]] beliefs in the pre-Hindu-Buddhist female deity of the southern ocean. The fierce waves of the [[Indian Ocean]] on southern Java's coasts, its storms and sometimes [[tsunami]]s, probably had raised in the locals awe and fear of natural power, and locals attributed it to the spiritual realm of deities and [[demon]]s that inhabit the southern seas ruled by their queen, a female deity, later identified as "Queen Kidul".

The 16th century Javanese legends connects the Queen of Southern Seas as the protector and spiritual consort of the kings of [[Mataram Sultanate]]. [[Panembahan Senopati]] (1586–1601 AD), founder of the [[Mataram Sultanate]], and his grandson [[Sultan Agung]] (1613–1645 AD) who named the Kanjeng Ratu Kidul as their bride, is claimed in the [[Babad Tanah Jawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Babad Tanah Jawi by Dr. J.J. Ras – {{ISBN|90-6765-218-0}} (34:100 – 36:1)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Javanese legends dated from 16th century CE, the prince Panembahan Senopati aspired to establish a new kingdom [[Mataram Sultanate]] against [[Pajang]] overlordship. He performed ascetic acts through meditating on the beach of Parang Kusumo, south of his home in the town of [[Kota Gede]]. His meditation caused a disturbing, powerful supernatural phenomenon in the spiritual kingdom of Southern Sea. The Queen came to the beach to see who had caused this menace in her kingdom. Upon seeing the handsome prince, the queen immediately fell in love and asked the prince to stop his meditation. In return, the deity queen, who ruled spiritual realm of the southern seas, agreed to help Panembahan Senopati in his political effort to establish a new kingdom. In order to become the spiritual protector of the kingdom, the Queen asked to be held by the prince in hand of marriage, as the spiritual consort of Panembahan Senopati and all of his successors, the series of Mataram kings.

One Sundanese folktale is mentioned about Dewi Kadita, the beautiful princess of the [[Pajajaran]] Kingdom, in [[West Java]], who desperately fled to the Southern Sea after being struck by black magic. The black magic was cast by a witch under the order of a jealous rival in the palace and it caused the beautiful princess to suffer a disgusting skin disease. She later jumps into the violent waves of the ocean where she was finally cured and regained her beauty, and the spirits and demons crowned the girl as the legendary Spirit-Queen of the South Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Meijboom, Jos – Javaansche sagen mythen en legenden, Zutphen – W.J. Thieme &amp; Cie, 1924 pp 204 – 243, {{ISBN|90-03-91270-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar version of the story above mentions that the king (at the time), who had her as his only child, was planning to retire from the throne. At the time, having a queen lead a kingdom, instead of a king, was forbidden. Therefore, the king remarried and sought for a male heir to his throne from his new wife. The king's wife finally gets impregnated, but, due to jealousy, forces the king to choose between her and his daughter. His wife then stated an ultimatum; If he chose his daughter, then his wife would leave the palace for good and the throne would be given to his daughter, who would later become the queen. If the wife was chosen instead, the daughter would be banned from the palace and the unborn child of his wife would later claim the throne as king. The king then made his decision to ban his daughter from the palace and orders a witch to curse his daughter, leaving her to suffer a skin disease. The pitiful daughter, now banned from the palace, hears a voice that tells her that if she wants to be cured of her terrible disease, she should jump into the seawater as midnight strikes. She followed as instructed and then she vanished, never to be seen or heard from again.

Another Sundanese folktale shows ''Banyoe Bening'' (meaning ''clear water'') becomes Queen of the Djojo Koelon Kingdom and, suffering from [[leprosy]], travels to the South where she is taken up by a huge wave to disappear into the Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Njai Loro Kidoel by Inten Bayan aka Rene Adeboi, Moesson, The Hague 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

Another West Java folktale is about the [[Ajar Cemara Tunggal]] (Adjar Tjemara Toenggal) on the mountain of [[Kombang]] in the [[Pajajaran]] Kingdom. He is a male [[clairvoyant|seer]] who actually was the beautiful great aunt of [[Raden Jaka Susuruh]]. She disguised herself as a psychic and told Raden Jaka Susuruh to go to the east of Java to found a kingdom on the place where a ''maja''-tree just had one fruit; the fruit was bitter, ''pait'' in Javanese, and the kingdom got the name of [[Majapahit]]. The seer Cemara Tunggal would marry the founder of Majapahit and any descendant in first line, to help them in all kind of matters. Though the seer's spirit would have transmigrated into the "spirit-queen of the south" who shall reign over the spirits, demons and all dark creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Babad Tanah Jawi by Dr. J.J. Ras – {{ISBN|90-6765-218-0}} (7:16 – 9:1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialities==
''Sarang Burung'' are Javanese bird's nests, and some of the finest in the world. The edible bird's nests, in the form of [[Bird's nest soup]] or ''sarang burung'', that find a ready market in [[China]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] are dedicated to Nyai Loro Kidul, mentioned by Sultan Agung in reports.

There are three harvests which are known as the ''Unduan-Kesongo'', ''Unduan-Telor'' and ''Unduan-Kepat'', and take place in April, the latter part of August (the largest), and December. The places [[Rongkob]] and {{ill|Karang Bolong, Kebumen|lt=Karang Bolong|id|Karangbolong, Buayan, Kebumen}} along the south coast of central Java are famous for the edible bird's nests, made by the little sea swallows (so called, but actually [[swiftlet]]s), called ''Salanganen'' or ''[[Collocalia fuciphaga]]''. The harvests are famous because of the [[wayang]] performances which are held, and the Javanese ritual dances which are performed with [[gamelan]] music as the traditional ceremony.

This happens in a cave (Karang Bolong) and when these are ended specially prepared offerings are made in a shed in what is known as the "Royal Bed of Nyai Loro Kidul". This relic is hung with beautiful silk [[batik]] kains, and a toilet mirror is placed against the green-coloured pillows of the bed.&lt;ref&gt;De Cock Wheatley, Ch. In the Realms of a Mystic Queen, Inter-Ocean, 12–13, 1931–'32 – KITLV Leiden Holland pp 205–210&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyai Loro Kidul is the patron goddess of the [[bird's-nest gatherer]]s of South Java. The gatherers descend the sheer cliff-face on [[coconut fibre]] ropes to an overhang some thirty feet above the water where a rickety [[bamboo]] platform has been built. From there they must await their wave, drop into it, and be swept beneath the overhang into the cave. Here they grope around in total darkness filling their bags with bird's nests. Going back needs very precise timing, to avoid misjudging the tides, and falling into the violent waves.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Lawrence and Lorne. Ring of Fire an Indonesian Odyssey, Park Street Press Hongkong 1991 {{ISBN|0-89281-430-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dutch and their Javanese legacy==
The term ''wali'' which is applied to all of the Islam teachers is Arabic (meaning "''saint''"), but the title "''sunan''" which they all carry, too, is Javanese. ''Sunan Kalijaga'' used to be one of the most "popular" Wali Sanga, and he got deeply involved with Nyai Loro Kidul because of the water aspect (at the beach of Pemancingan of northern Java, ''kali'' means ''river''). Panembahan Senopati Ingalaga (1584–1601), founder of Mataram's imperial expansion, sought the support of the goddess of the Southern Ocean (Kangjeng Ratu Kidul or Nyai Loro Kidul) at Pemancinang of southern Java.

She was to become the special protectress of the House of Mataram. Senopati's reliance upon both Sunan Kalijaga and Nyai Loro Kidul in the chronicles accounts nicely reflects the Mataram Dynasty's ambivalence towards Islam and indigenous Javanese beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Ricklefs, M.C.  A history of modern Indonesia since c.1300, The Macmillan Press LTD 1993, pp 7, 41, {{ISBN|0-333-57690-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local beliefs==

===Pelabuhan Ratu===
[[Pelabuhan Ratu]], a small fishermen city in [[West Java]], celebrates an annual holiday in her honor on April 6. A memorial day for the locals, offering a lot of ceremonial "presents" to appease the queen. The local fishermen annually send the ''sedekah laut'' ceremony, offering gifts and sacrifices; from [[rice]], vegetables and agricultural produces, to chicken, [[batik]] fabrics and cosmetics, to be ''larung'' (sent afloat to the sea) and finally drawn it to the sea to appease the queen. The local fishermen believed that the ceremony would please the Queen of Southern Sea, that in return would give them some good catches in fisheries and also would bless the surrounding areas with better weather, fewer storms and waves.

Nyai Loro Kidul is also associated with [[Parangtritis]], Parangkusumo, [[Pangandaran]], [[Karang Bolong Beach (Anyer)|Karang Bolong]], [[Ngliyep]], [[Puger]], [[Banyuwangi]], and places all along the south coast of Java. There is a local belief that wearing a green garment in these areas will anger her and will bring misfortune on the wearer, as green is her sacred colour.&lt;ref&gt;Legend of Borobudur, pp 114: Dr. C.W. Wormser – Het Hooge Heiligdom – Uitgeverij W. Van Hoeve Deventer, N.V. Maatschappij Vorkink Bandoeng&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samudra Beach Hotel===
The Samudra Beach Hotel, [[Pelabuhan Ratu]], West Java, keeps room 308 furnished with green colours and reserved for Nyai Loro Kidul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.jawakidul.nl/room308.htm| title = Room 308 A room for the Javanese goddess of The South Sea| accessdate = July 5, 2007| last = Döhne| first = Roy James| publisher = Website Roy James}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first president of Indonesia, [[Sukarno]], was involved with the exact location and the idea for the Samudra Beach Hotel. In front of the room 308 there is the Ketapang tree where [[Sukarno]] got his spiritual inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://indahnesia.com/indonesia/JAWSAM/samudra_beach.php| title = Room No. 308 still retains its mystery| accessdate = December 20, 2006| last = Khouw| first = Ida Indawati| publisher = The Jakarta Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting of Nyai Rara Kidul by [[Basuki Abdullah]], a famous Indonesian painter, is displayed in this room.

===Yogyakarta and Central Java===
The legend of Queen Kidul is often associated with beaches in Yogyakarta, especially Parangkusumo and [[Parangtritis]]. Parangkusumo in particular is special since it was the place believed to be the location of the first spiritual encounter between the Queen with [[Panembahan Senopati]]. Legends recount her love for Senopati and the famous Sultan Agung of Mataram, which continues to be recounted in the ritualized [[Bedhaya]] dance by the royal line of [[Surakarta]], and she is honored by the susuhunans of Solo/Surakarta and the sultans of Yogyakarta, Central-Java. When [[Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX]] died on October 3, 1988, the ''Tempo'' newsmagazine reported her sighting by palace servants, who were sure she was paying her final tribute to the dead ruler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.tempointeraktif.com/ang/min/02/02/nas3.htm| title = Wawancara Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono X|  date = March 15, 1997| last = PDAT| first = D&amp;R| publisher = Tempo Nacional| language = Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Underwater topography}}
[[Image:Ocean dynamic topography.jpg||400px|right|thumb| TOPEX/Poseidon was the first space mission that allowed scientists to map ocean topography with sufficient accuracy to study the large-scale current systems of the world's ocean. Although this image was constructed from only 10 days of TOPEX/Poseidon data (October 3 to October 12, 1992), it reveals most of the current systems that have been identified by shipboard observations collected over the last 100 years.]]

The ocean surface has highs and lows, similar to the hills and valleys of Earth's land surface depicted on a [[topographic map]]. These variations, called '''ocean surface topography''' (or '''sea surface topography'''), also '''dynamic topography''', are mapped using direct (usually satellite-based) or indirect measurements of sea surface height relative to Earth's [[geoid]]. Earth's geoid is a calculated surface of equal gravitational potential energy and represents the shape the sea surface would be if the ocean were not in motion. The main purpose of measuring ocean surface topography is to understand the large-scale circulation of the ocean.

On a daily basis, sea surface height (SSH) is most obviously affected by the [[tidal force]]s of the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]] acting on the [[Earth]]. Over longer timescales, SSH is influenced by [[ocean circulation]]. Typically, SSH anomalies resulting from these forces differ from the mean by less than ±{{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at the global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Stewart | first = R.H. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title = Introduction To Physical Oceanography | publisher= | date = September 2008 | location= | pages= | url = http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/PDF_files/book.pdf
 | doi= | id= | isbn = }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other influences include temperature, salinity, tides, waves, and the loading of atmospheric pressure. The slowest and largest variations are due to changes in the [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]] ([[geoid]]) due to the rearrangement of continents, formation of sea mounts and other redistribution of rock. 

Since the Earth's gravitational field is relatively stable on decadal to centennial timescales, ocean circulation plays a more significant role in the observed variation of SSH. Across the [[season|seasonal cycle]] changes in patterns of warming, cooling and surface [[wind]] forcing affect circulation and influence SSH. Variations in SSH can be measured by [[satellite]] [[altimeter|altimetry]] (e.g. [[TOPEX/Poseidon]]) and used to determine [[sea level rise]] and properties such as ocean heat storage.

==Applications==
Ocean surface topography is used to map [[ocean current]]s, which move around the ocean's "hills" and "valleys" in predictable ways. A clockwise sense of rotation is found around "hills" in the northern hemisphere and "valleys" in the southern hemisphere. This is because of the [[Coriolis effect]]. Conversely, a counterclockwise sense of rotation is found around "valleys" in the northern hemisphere and "hills" in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/education/tutorial2.html |title=TOPEX/Poseidon on-line tutorial. Part II.| website = Ocean Surface Topography from Space | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916233519/http://topex-www.jpl.nasa.gov/education/tutorial2.html | archivedate = 2008-09-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ocean surface topography is also used to understand how the ocean moves heat around the globe, a critical component of Earth's [[climate]], and for monitoring changes in global [[sea level rise|sea level]].  The sea surface height (SSH) is calculated through altimetry satellites, which determine the distance from the satellite to a target surface by measuring the satellite-to-surface round-trip time of a radar pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dudley B. |last1=Chelton |first2=John C. |last2=Ries |first3=Bruce J. |last3=Haines |first4=Lee-Lueng |last4=Ru |first5=Philip S. |last5=Callahan |chapter=Satellite Altimetry |page=1 |editor-last1=Fu |editor-first1=Lee-Lueng |editor-last2=Cazenave |editor-first2=Andy |title=Satellite altimetry and earth sciences : a handbook of techniques and applications |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=9780080516585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Glazman |first1=R.

Due to the differing depths of the ocean, an approximation is made. This is called the Arbitrary Reference Surface.  Arbitrary Reference Surface is an estimated surface that is calculated to factor in the shape of the Earth.  The general shape of the earth is spherical, but flattened out at the [[Polar regions of Earth|North and South Pole]]. This approximated surface is called the reference ellipsoid.  This enables data to be taken precisely due to the uniform surface level.  The satellite’s altitude then has to be calculated with respect to the reference ellipsoid.  It is calculated using the orbital parameters of the satellite and various positioning instruments.  The sea surface height is then the difference between the satellite’s altitude relative to the reference ellipsoid and the altimeter range.  The satellite sends microwave pulses to the ocean surface.  The travel time of the pulses ascending to the oceans surface and back provides data of the sea surface height.

The collection of the data is useful for the long-term information about the ocean and its currents.  According to [[NASA]] science this data can also be used to provide understanding of weather, climate, navigation, fisheries management, and offshore operations.  Observations made about the data are used to study the oceans tides, circulation, and the amount of heat the ocean contains. These observations can help predict short and long term effects of the weather and the earth’s climate over time.

Currently there are two different satellites calculating the earth ocean topography, [[Jason-1]], and Jason-2. These two satellites are currently both in space orbiting Earth in a tandem rotation.  They are approximately 330 kilometers apart.

Ocean surface topography can be derived from [[ship]]-going [[measurement]]s of [[temperature]] and [[salinity]] at depth. However, since 1992, a series of  [[satellite]] [[altimeter|altimetry]] missions, beginning with [[TOPEX/Poseidon]] and continued with [[Jason-1]] and the [[Ocean Surface Topography Mission]] on the Jason-2 satellite have measured sea surface height directly. By combining these measurements with gravity measurements from NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|Grace]] mission, scientists can determine sea surface topography to within a few centimeters.

[[Jason-1]] was launched by a Boeing Delta II rocket in California in 2001 and continued measurements initially collected by [[TOPEX/Poseidon]] satellite, which orbited from 1992 up until 2006.&lt;ref name=Menard&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ménard |first1=Yves |last2=Fu |first2=Lee-Lueng |last3=Escudier |first3=P. |last4=Parisot |first4=F. |last5=Perbos |first5=J. |last6=Vincent |first6=P. |last7=Desai |first7=S. |last8=Haines |first8=B. |last9=Kunstmann |first9=G. |title=The Jason-1 Mission Special Issue: Jason-1 Calibration/Validation |journal=Marine Geodesy |date=21 June 2010 |volume=26 |issue=3-4 |pages=131–146 |doi=10.1080/714044514}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] and [[CNES]], a French space agency, are joint partners in this mission.

The main objectives of the [[Jason-1]] satellite is to collect data on the average ocean circulation around the globe in order to better understand its interaction with the time varying components and the involved mechanisms for initializing ocean models.  To monitor the low frequency ocean variability and observe the season cycles and inter-annual variations like [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]], the North Atlantic oscillation, the pacific decadal oscillation, and planetary waves crossing the oceans over a period of months, then they will be modeled over a long period of time due to the precise altimetric observations.&lt;ref name=Menard/&gt; It aims to contribute to observations of the mesoscale ocean variability, affecting the whole oceans.  This activity is especially intense near western boundary currents. Also monitor the average [[sea level]] because it is a large indicator of global warming through the [[sea level]] data.  Improvement of tide modeling by observing more long period components such as costal interactions, internal waves, and tidal energy dissipation. Finally the satellite data will supply knowledge to support other types of marine meteorology which is the scientific study of the atmosphere.

Jason-2 was launched on June 20, 2008 by a Delta-2 rocket out of the California site in Vandenberg.  Its current mission is to transfer the current data into a second decade of data collection on the ocean height. 
The long-term objectives of the Jason-2 satellite were to provide global descriptions of the seasonal and yearly changes of the circulation and heat storage in the ocean.&lt;ref name=Lambin&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lambin |first1=Juliette |last2=Morrow |first2=Rosemary |last3=Fu |first3=Lee-Lueng |last4=Willis |first4=Josh K. |last5=Bonekamp |first5=Hans |last6=Lillibridge |first6=John |last7=Perbos |first7=Jacqueline |last8=Zaouche |first8=Gérard |last9=Vaze |first9=Parag |last10=Bannoura |first10=Walid |last11=Parisot |first11=François |last12=Thouvenot |first12=Eric |last13=Coutin-Faye |first13=Sophie |last14=Lindstrom |first14=Eric |last15=Mignogno |first15=Mike |title=The OSTM/Jason-2 Mission |journal=Marine Geodesy |date=16 August 2010 |volume=33 |issue=sup1 |pages=4–25 |doi=10.1080/01490419.2010.491030}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the study of short-term climatic changes such as [[El Nino]], [[La Nina]].  The satellites detect global [[sea level]] mean and record the fluctuations.  Also detecting the slow change of upper ocean circulation on decadal time scales, every ten years. Studying the transportation of heat and carbon in the ocean and examining the main components that fuel deep water tides.  The satellites data collection also helps improve wind speed and height measurements in current time and for long term studies. Lastly improving our knowledge about the marine [[geoid]].&lt;ref name=Lambin/&gt; The first seven months Jason-2 was put into use it was flown in extreme close proximity to [[Jason-1]].  Only being one minute apart from each other the satellites observed the same area of the ocean.  The reason for the close proximity in observation was for cross-calibration.  This was meant to calculate any bias in the two altimeters.  This multiple month observation proved that there was no bias in the data and both collections of data were consistent.&lt;ref name=Lambin/&gt;

A new satellite mission called the [[Surface Water Ocean Topography Mission]] has been proposed to make the first global survey of the topography of all of Earth's surface water—the ocean, lakes and rivers.  This study is aimed to provide a comprehensive view of Earth’s freshwater bodies from space and more much detailed measurements of the ocean surface than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Following the Water with the Ocean Surface Topography Mission |date=September 2008 |newspaper=Surface Topography From Space |publisher= Jet Propulsion Laboratory |url=http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/features/200809-1b.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620221126/http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/features/200809-1b.html|archivedate=2009-06-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==

The Ocean Surface Topography Mission is a combined effort from four different organizations with one mutual focus; measure sea surface height.  The four contributing organizations are National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]), France’s Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales ([[CNES]]), National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration ([[NOAA]]), and European Meteorological Satellite Organisation ([[EUMETSAT]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ocean surface topography |url=https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/oceanography/physical-ocean/ocean-surface-topography |website=NASA Science |publisher=NASA |accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Indian family in Brazil posed in front of hut.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|Humans traditionally lived in family-based social structures and artificial shelters.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}]]
'''Personal life''' is the course of an [[personhood|individual]]'s life, especially when viewed as the sum of personal choices contributing to one's [[identity (social science)|personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Baker| first1 = Maureen| title = Choices and Constraints in Family Life| edition = 2| location = Don Mills, Ontario| publisher = Oxford University Press| publication-date = 2010| page = 1| isbn = 978-0-19-543159-9| quote = In this book, I argue that intimate relationships are certainly influenced by our personal preferences but to a large extent our 'choices' are shaped by family circumstances and events in the wider society [...] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient past, most people's time was limited by the need to meet necessities such as food and shelter and there was not much [[leisure time]]. People identified with their [[social role]] in their community, and engaged in [[job]]s based on necessity rather than personal choice. [[Privacy]] in such communities was rare.

The modern conception of personal life is an offshoot of modern Western society. A modern person tends to distinguish one's work from one's personal life. It is a person's choices and preferences outside work that define personal life, including one's choice of hobbies, cultural interests, manner of dress, and so on. In particular, what activities one engages in during leisure-time defines a person's personal life. For instance, a typical American has about five hours of leisure time per day, more than half of which is spent on watching TV.

People in Western countries, such as the [[United States]], tend to value privacy. Privacy includes both [[information privacy]] and decisional privacy; people expect to be left alone with respect to intimate details of their life and they expect to be free from undue control by others.

==History==
[[File:11-stages-womanhood-1840s.jpg|thumb|"The Life &amp; Age of Woman - Stages of Woman's Life from the Cradle to the Grave", 1849]]

In the past, before modern [[technology]] largely alleviated issues of economic [[scarcity]] in industrialised countries, most people spent a large portion of their time attempting to provide their basic survival needs, including water, food, and protection from the weather.&lt;ref name="Van Loon"&gt;{{cite book|last= Van Loon|first=Hendrik|title= The Story of Mankind|year= 1921|publisher= Boni and Liveright, Inc.|location= New York|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/VanStor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans needed [[survival skills]] for the sake of both themselves and their community; food needed to be harvested and shelters needed to be maintained.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gupta |first=Anil K. |title=Origin of agriculture and domestication of plants and animals linked to early Holocene climate amelioration |journal=Current Science |date=10 July 2004 |volume=87 |issue=1 |url=http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul102004/54.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031122606/http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/jul102004/54.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 October 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was little [[privacy]] in a community, and people identified one another according to their social role.&lt;ref name=Barnard&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnard|first=Alan J.|title= Hunter-gatherers in history, archaeology and anthropology|year=2004|publisher= Berg Publishers|isbn= 978-1-85973-825-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Labour (economics)|Jobs]] were assigned out of necessity rather than personal choice.&lt;ref name=ERA&gt;{{cite web|title=Why did anthropologists get interested in peasants?|url= http://era.anthropology.ac.uk/Era_Resources/Era/Peasants/intro2.html|work= Experience Rich Anthropology|publisher= University of Kent at Canterbury|accessdate= 26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, individuals in many [[ancient culture]]s primarily viewed their [[self-existence]] under the aspect of a larger social whole, often one with [[mythological]] underpinnings which placed the individual in relation to the [[cosmos]].&lt;ref name=Percy&gt;{{cite book|last=Percy|first=Walker|title= Lost in the cosmos: the last self-help book|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-25399-8|authorlink= Walker Percy}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in such cultures found their identity not through their individual [[choice]]s—indeed, they may not have been able to conceive a choice which was purely individual. Such individuals, if asked to describe themselves, would speak of the collective of which they were part: the [[tribe]], the [[Christian Church|Church]], the [[nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Ashton-Jones|first1= Evelyn|title= The Gender reader|year= 1991|publisher= Allyn and Bacon|location= Boston|isbn= 0-205-12806-8|pages=252|author2= Lindholm, Cherry|chapter= Life behind the Veil|author3= Charles Lindholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 21st century, survival issues dominate in many countries and societies. For example, the continents of Africa and Asia are still largely mired in [[poverty]] and [[third-world]] conditions, without technology, secure shelter, or reliable food sources. In such places, the concepts of a "personal life", "[[self-actualization]]", "personal fulfillment", or "[[privacy]]" are often unaffordable luxuries.&lt;ref name=Maslow&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1037/h0054346|last= Maslow|first= A.

The English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632-1704) figures among the pioneers in discussing the concept of [[individual rights]]. In the 17th century he promoted the natural rights of the individual to [[right to life|life]], [[liberty]], and [[property]], and included the [[pursuit of happiness]] as one of the individual's goals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Like democratic materialism, democratic individualism led to the death of civic life and opened the door to any despotic power that would assume responsibility for shared interests.

This [[9 to 5]] paradigm regards work and [[recreation]] as distinct; one is either on the job or not, and the transition is abrupt. Employees have certain hours they are bound to work, and work during recreational time is rare. This may{{original research inline|date= August 2016}} reflect the continuing specialization of jobs and the demand for increased efficiency, both at work and at home. The common phrase "Work hard, play hard" illustrates this mindset.

The way in which individuals make use of their spare time also plays an important role in defining their personal lives. In general, leisure activities can be categorised as either passive, in cases when no real effort is required, or active, when substantial physical or mental energy is needed.&lt;ref name=Stebbins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stebbins|first=Robert A.|title=Choice and Experiential Definitions of Leisure|journal=LSA Newsletter|date=November 2002|volume=63|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~stebbins/reflections1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passive activities include watching [[television]], listening to [[music]], watching sports activities or going to the [[movie theatre|cinema]]. The individual simply relaxes without any special effort.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Active activities may be more or less intensive ranging from [[walking]], through [[jogging]] and [[cycling]] to sports such as [[tennis]] or [[football]].

'''Plasma deep drilling technology''' is one of several different variants of recently explored [[new drilling technologies]] which would be able to substitute conventional, contact-based rotary systems.
These new technologies, including plasma deep drilling, [[Water jet cutter|water jet]], [[Spallation|hydrothermal spallation]] or [[laser]], are matter of active research. Only a very small number of companies have embraced plasma-drilling method, e.g. [[Geothermal Anywhere|GA Drilling]], headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia.

==High-energetic electrical plasma==

High-energetic electrical plasma is a technology currently being developed in deep drilling applications to address many issues related to drilling in water environment or in the production of boreholes with a wide range of diameters.

==Physical principle of electrical plasma==
[[Image:Drilling using electrical plasma.jpg|thumb|Drilling using electrical plasma]]
An [[electric arc]] is an electrical breakdown of a gas that produces an ongoing [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharge, resulting from a current flowing through normally nonconductive media such as air or gas. An arc discharge is characterized by a lower voltage than a glow discharge, and relies on thermionic emission of electrons from the electrodes supporting the arc. The electric arc is influenced by factors such as: the gas flow, inner and outer magnetic fields, and construction elements of the chamber which confine the arc. The development of highly effective plasma torches to be used as a source of the thermal plasma, demands a deep understanding of a wide spectrum of the processes taking place in the discharge chamber.

==Advantages of Plasma deep drilling technology==

# Higher drilling energy efficiency
# Continuous drilling process without replacement of mechanical parts
# Constant casing diameter
# Effective transport of disintegrated rock

A '''pumice raft''' is a floating raft of [[pumice]] occasionally created by ocean-based or near-ocean [[volcanic]] activity.

Biologists suggest that animals and plants have [[Animal migration|migrated]] from island to island on pumice rafts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=17605 New Island and Pumice Raft, Tonga], NASA Earth Observatory photo with commentary, August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nunn|first=Patrick D.|title=Vanished Islands and Hidden Continents of the Pacific|year=2008|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3219-3|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Astrobiologist]]s have hypothetically linked pumice rafts to the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin D. Brasier, Richard Matthewman, Sean McMahon and David Wacey. "Pumice as a Remarkable Substrate for the Origin of Life" Astrobiology. August 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
{{main|2012 Kermadec Islands eruption}}
A large pumice raft appeared near [[New Zealand]] in August 2012. It was reported to be spread on an area {{convert|300|mi|km|order=flip}} long, {{convert|30|mi|km|-1|order=flip}} wide, and riding {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|abbr=out|order=flip}} above the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Space.com, [http://www.space.com/17102-pumice-raft-pacific-volcano-source.html "Source of Mysterious Pumice 'Raft' in Pacific Found, NASA Says"], Jeanna Bryner, 14 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August 2012 [[2012 Kermadec Islands eruption and pumice raft|a raft with an estimated area of 26,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (10,000 sq mi) was observed near [[Raoul Island]], north-east of New Zealand by the Royal New Zealand Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vast volcanic 'raft' found in Pacific, near New Zealand |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19207810 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=10 August 2012 |date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/undersea-eruption-creates-pumic-raft/story-fn3dxix6-1226447601191 | work=The Australian | title=Pumice raft bigger than area of Israel | date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/floating-pumice/index.html | work=CNN | title='Weirdest thing' floats in South Pacific - CNN.com | date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanic activity in the South Pacific near [[Tonga]] on August 12, 2006 caused the emergence of a new island. The crew of the ''Maiken'', a yacht that had left the northern Tongan islands group of [[Vava'u]] in August, reported that they had seen streaks of light, porous [[pumice]] stone floating in the water—and then had "sailed into a vast, many-miles-wide belt of densely packed pumice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yacht-maiken.blogspot.com/2006/08/stone-sea-and-volcano.html |title=Stone sea and volcano |work=Fredrik and Crew on Maiken |publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] |date=2006-08-17 |accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went on to witness the [[ephemeral]] island known as [[Home Reef]] breaching the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/view.php?id=17610 New Island and Pumice Raft, Tonga], NASA Earth Observatory photo with commentary, November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Pumice rafts drifted to [[Fiji]] in 1979 and 1984 from eruptions around Tonga, and some were reportedly {{convert|30|km|mile}} wide.

'''Sick building syndrome''' ('''SBS''') is a medical condition where people in a building suffer from symptoms of illness or feel unwell for no apparent reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wondermakers.com/Portals/0/docs/Sick%20building%20syndrome%20by%20WHO.pdf|title=Sick Building Syndrome|last=|first=|date=n.d. |website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The symptoms tend to increase in severity with the time people spend in the building, and improve over time or even disappear when people are away from the building.  The main identifying observation is an increased incidence of complaints of symptoms such as headache, eye, nose, and throat irritation, fatigue, and dizziness and nausea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stolwijk|first=J A|date=1991-11-01|title=Sick-building syndrome.|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=95|pages=99–100|issn=0091-6765|pmc=1568418|pmid=1821387|doi=10.1289/ehp.919599}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These symptoms appear to be linked to time spent in a building, though no specific illness or cause can be identified.  SBS is also used interchangeably with "building-related symptoms", which orients the name of the condition around patients rather than a "sick" building.  A 1984 [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report suggested up to 30% of new and remodeled buildings worldwide may be subject of complaints related to poor [[indoor air quality]].&lt;ref name="Sick Building Syndrome"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/sbs.html|title=Sick Building Syndrome|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)|accessdate=2009-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sick building causes are frequently pinned down to flaws in the [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] (HVAC) systems.  However, there have been inconsistent findings on whether air conditioning systems result in SBS or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shahzad|first=Sally S.|last2=Brennan|first2=John|last3=Theodossopoulos|first3=Dimitris|last4=Hughes|first4=Ben|last5=Calautit|first5=John Kaiser|date=2016-04-06|title=Building-Related Symptoms, Energy, and Thermal Control in the Workplace: Personal and Open Plan Offices|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/4/331|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=331|doi=10.3390/su8040331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other causes have been attributed to contaminants produced by [[outgassing]] of some types of building materials, [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOC), [[molds]] (see [[mold health issues]]), improper exhaust [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] of [[ozone]] (byproduct of some office machinery), light industrial chemicals used within, or lack of adequate fresh-air intake/air filtration (see [[Minimum efficiency reporting value]]).

==Signs and symptoms==
Human exposure to [[bioaerosol]]s has been documented to give rise to a variety of adverse health effects.&lt;ref name=Sundell&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Sundell| first1=J| last2=Lindval| first2=T|last3=Berndt|first3=S|title=Association between type of ventilation and airflow rates in office buildings and the risk of SBS-symptoms among occupants.| journal=Environ.Int.| date=1994| volume=20| issue=2| pages=239–251| doi=10.1016/0160-4120(94)90141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building occupants complain of symptoms such as sensory [[irritation]] of the eyes, nose, or throat; neurotoxic or general health problems; skin irritation; nonspecific [[hypersensitivity]] reactions; infectious diseases;&lt;ref name=Rylander&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Rylander| first1=R| title=Investigation of the relationship between disease and airborne (1P3)-b-D-glucan in buildings.|journal=Med.

New York: CRC Press. pp. 196–197. {{ISBN|1-56670-402-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to poor lighting conditions has led to general malaise.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jafari|first=Mohammad Javad|last2=Khajevandi|first2=Ali Asghar|last3=Mousavi Najarkola|first3=Seyed Ali|last4=Yekaninejad|first4=Mir Saeed|last5=Pourhoseingholi|first5=Mohammad Amin|last6=Omidi|first6=Leila|last7=Kalantary|first7=Saba|date=2015-01-01|title=Association of Sick Building Syndrome with Indoor Air Parameters|journal=Tanaffos|volume=14|issue=1|pages=55–62|issn=1735-0344|pmc=4515331|pmid=26221153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic allergic [[alveolitis]] has been associated with the presence of fungi and bacteria in the moist air of residential houses and commercial offices.&lt;ref name=Teculescu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teculescu|first1=D.B.|title=Sick Building Symptoms in office workers in northern France: a pilot study|journal=Int Arch. Occup. Environ. Health|date=1998|volume=71|issue=5|pages=353–356|doi=10.1007/s004200050292}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very large 2017 Swedish study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/cea.12976 | pmid=28695715 | title=Patient-reported signs of dampness at home may be a risk factor for chronic rhinosinusitis: A cross-sectional study | journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Allergy | volume=47 | issue=11 | pages=1383–1389 | author=Pind C. Ahlroth| year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; correlated several inflammatory diseases of the respiration tract with objective evidence of damp-caused damage in homes.

The WHO has classified the reported symptoms into broad categories, including: mucous membrane irritation (eye, nose, and throat irritation), neurotoxic effects (headaches, fatigue, and irritability), asthma and asthma-like symptoms (chest tightness and wheezing), skin dryness and irritation, gastrointestinal complaints and more.&lt;ref name=Apter&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Apter|first1=A|title=Epidemiology of the sick building syndrome.|journal=J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.| date=1994| issue=94| pages=277–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sick occupants may report individual symptoms which do not appear to be connected.  The key to discovery is the increased incidence of illnesses in general with onset or exacerbation within a fairly close time frame—usually within a period of weeks. In most cases, SBS symptoms will be relieved soon after the occupants leave the particular room or zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Sick Building Syndrome | publisher=National Safety Council |date=2009 | access-date=April 27, 2009 | url=http://www.nsc.org/resources/Factsheets/environment/sbs.aspx | website=NSC.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there can be lingering effects of various [[neurotoxin]]s, which may not clear up when the occupant leaves the building. In some cases—particularly in sensitive individuals—there can be long-term health effects.

==Cause==
It has been suggested{{by whom|date=February 2017}} that sick building syndrome could be caused by inadequate ventilation, deteriorating fiberglass duct liners, chemical contaminants from indoor or outdoor sources, and biological contaminants, air recycled using fan coils, traffic noise, poor lighting, and buildings located in a polluted urban area.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Many volatile organic compounds, which are considered chemical contaminants, can cause acute effects on the occupants of a building. "Bacteria, molds, pollen, and viruses are types of biological contaminants" and can all cause SBS.  In addition, pollution from outdoors, such as motor vehicle exhaust, can contribute to SBS.&lt;ref name="Sick Building Syndrome" /&gt;  Adult SBS symptoms were associated with a history of allergic rhinitis, eczema and asthma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A 2015 study concerning the association of SBS and indoor air pollutants in office buildings in Iran found as [[carbon dioxide]] levels increase in a building, symptoms like nausea, headaches, nasal irritation, [[dyspnea]], and throat dryness have also been shown to increase.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Certain work conditions have been found to be correlated with specific symptoms. For example, higher light intensity was significantly related to skin dryness, eye pain, and malaise.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Higher temperature has also been found to correlate with symptoms such as sneezing, skin redness, itchy eyes and headache, while higher relative humidity has been associated with sneezing, skin redness, and pain of the eyes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[ASHRAE]] has recognized that polluted urban air, designated within the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s air quality ratings as unacceptable requires the installation of treatment such as filtration for which the [[HVAC]] practitioners generally apply carbon-impregnated filters and their like.

In 1973, in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]] and [[energy conservation|conservation]] concerns, ASHRAE Standards 62-73 and 62-81 reduced required ventilation from {{convert|10|cuft/min|L/s}} per person to {{convert|5|cuft/min|L/s}} per person, but this was found to be a contributing factor to sick building syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 2796751 | pmid=20040980 | doi=10.4103/0019-5278.43262 | volume=12 | issue=2 | title=The sick building syndrome | author=Joshi S. M. | journal=Indian J. Occup. Environ. Med. | pages=61–4| year=2008 }} in section 3 "Inadequate ventilation".&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the 2016 revision, ASHRAE ventilation standards call for 5 to 10 cubic feet per minute of ventilation per occupant (depending on the occupancy type) in addition to ventilation based on the zone floor area delivered to the breathing zone.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological factors===
One study looked at commercial buildings and their employees, comparing some environmental factors suspected of inducing SBS to a self-reported survey of the occupants,&lt;ref&gt;Taken from another study: Whitehead II.{{clarify|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; finding that the measured psycho-social circumstances appeared more influential than the tested environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16556750 | doi=10.1136/oem.2005.022889 | pmc=2078095 | volume=63 | issue=4 | title=Building health: an epidemiological study of "sick building syndrome" in the Whitehall II study | author=Marmot A. F., Eley J., Stafford M., Stansfeld S. A., Warwick E., Marmot M. G. | journal=Occup. Environ. Med. | pages=283–9| year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The list of environmental factors in the study can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2078095/table/tbl1/ | pmc=2078095 | pmid=16556750 | doi=10.1136/oem.2005.022889 | volume=63 | issue=4 | title=Building health: an epidemiological study of "sick building syndrome" in the Whitehall II study | author=Marmot A. F., Eley J., Stafford M., Stansfeld S. A., Warwick E., Marmot M. G. | journal=Occup. Environ. Med. | pages=283–9| year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Limitations of the study include that it only measured the indoor environment of commercial buildings, which have different building codes than residential buildings, and that the assessment of building environment was based on layman observation of a limited number of factors.

Research has shown that SBS shares several symptoms common in other conditions thought to be at least partially caused by psychosomatic tendencies. The umbrella term "[[autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants]]" has been suggested. Other members of the suggested group include [[Silicosis]], [[Macrophagic myofasciitis|Macrophagic myofascitis]],[[Gulf War syndrome]], Post-vaccination phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=21188456 The sick building syndrome as a part of the autoimmune (auto-inflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants]. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace ===
Greater effects were found with features of the psychosocial work environment including high job demands and low support. The report concluded that the physical environment of office buildings appears to be less important than features of the psychosocial work environment in explaining differences in the prevalence of symptoms. However, there is still a relationship between sick building syndrome and symptoms of workers regardless of workplace stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bauer R. M., Greve K. W., Besch E. L., Schramke C. J., Crouch J., Hicks A., Lyles W. B. | year = 1992 | title = The role of psychological factors in the report of building-related symptoms in sick building syndrome | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 60 | issue = 2| pages = 213–219 | doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.60.2.213 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive work stress or dissatisfaction, poor interpersonal relationships and poor communication are often seen to be associated with SBS, recent studies show that a combination of environmental sensitivity and stress can greatly contribute to sick building syndrome.

Specific work-related stressors are related with specific SBS symptoms. Workload and work conflict are significantly associated with general symptoms (headache, abnormal tiredness, sensation of cold or nausea). While crowded workspaces and low work satisfaction are associated with upper respiratory symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Azuma K., Ikeda K., Kagi N., Yanagi U., Osawa H. | year = 2014 | title = Prevalence and risk factors associated with nonspecific building-related symptoms in office employees in Japan: Relationships between work environment, Indoor Air Quality, and occupational stress | url = | journal = Indoor Air | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 499–511 | doi = 10.1111/ina.12158 | pmid = 25244340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific careers are also associated with specific SBS symptoms. Transport, communication, healthcare, and social workers have highest prevalence of general symptoms. Skin symptoms such as eczema, itching, and rashes on hands and face are associated with technical work. Forestry, agriculture, and sales workers have the lowest rates of sick building syndrome symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norback D., Edling C. | year = 1991 | title = Environmental, occupational, and personal factors related to the prevalence of sick building syndrome in the general population | url = | journal = Occupational and Environmental Medicine | volume = 48 | issue = 7| pages = 451–462 | doi = 10.1136/oem.48.7.451 | pmid = 1854648 | pmc = 1035398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton et al. determined the cost of sick leave specific for one business was an estimated $480 per employee, and about five days of sick leave per year could be attributed to low ventilation rates. When comparing low ventilation rate areas of the building to higher ventilation rate areas, the relative risk of short-term sick leave was 1.53 times greater in the low ventilation areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Milton D.

=== Home ===
Sick building syndrome can also occur due to factors of the home. [[Laminate flooring|Laminated flooring]] can cause more exposure to chemicals and more resulting SBS symptoms compared to stone, tile, and cement flooring.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recent redecorating and new furnishings within the last year were also found to be associated with increased symptoms, along with dampness and related factors, having pets, and the presence of cockroaches.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The presence of mosquitoes was also a factor related to more symptoms, though it is unclear whether it was due to the presence of mosquitoes or the use of repellents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
While sick building syndrome (SBS) encompasses a multitude of non-specific symptoms, building-related illness (BRI) comprises specific, diagnosable symptoms caused by certain agents (chemicals, bacteria, fungi, etc.). These can typically be identified, measured, and quantified.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seltzer|first=J. M.|date=1994-08-01|title=Building-related illnesses|journal=The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=94|issue=2 Pt 2|pages=351–361|issn=0091-6749|pmid=8077589|doi=10.1016/0091-6749(94)90096-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are usually 4 causal agents in BRI; 1.) Immunologic, 2.) Infectious, 3.) toxic, and 4.) irritant.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  For instance, [[Legionnaire's disease]], usually caused by ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', involves a specific organism which could be ascertained through clinical findings as the source of contamination within a building. SBS does not have any known cure; alleviation consists of removing the affected person from the building associated with non-specific symptoms. BRI, on the other hand, utilizes treatment appropriate for the contaminant identified within the building (e.g., antibiotics for Legionnaire's disease). In most cases, simply improving the indoor air quality (IAQ) of a particular building will attenuate, or even eliminate, the acute symptoms of SBS, while removal of the source contaminant would prove more effective for a specific illness, as in the case of BRI.&lt;ref&gt;Indoor Air Facts No. 4 (revised) Sick building syndrome. Available from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/sbs.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Building-Related Illness is vital to the overall understanding of Sick Building Syndrome because BRI illustrates a causal path to infection, theoretically. Office BRI may more likely than not be explained by three events: “Wide range in the threshold of response in any population (susceptibility), a spectrum of response to any given agent, or variability in exposure within large office buildings."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menzies|first=Dick|last2=Bourbeau|first2=Jean|date=1997-11-20|title=Building-Related Illnesses|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=337|issue=21|pages=1524–1531|doi=10.1056/NEJM199711203372107|issn=0028-4793|pmid=9366585}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Isolating any one of the three aspects of office BRI can be a great challenge, which is why those who find themselves with BRI should take three steps, history, examinations, and interventions. History describes the action of continually monitoring and recording the health of workers experiencing BRI, as well as obtaining records of previous building alterations or related activity. Examinations go hand in hand with monitoring employee health. This step is done by physically examining the entire workspace and evaluating possible threats to health status among employees. Interventions follow accordingly based off the results of the Examination and History report.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Some studies have shown a small difference between genders, with women having slightly higher reports of SBS symptoms compared to men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Juan|last2=Li|first2=BaiZhan|last3=Yang|first3=Qin|last4=Wang|first4=Han|last5=Norback|first5=Dan|last6=Sundell|first6=Jan|date=2013-12-01|title=Sick building syndrome among parents of preschool children in relation to home environment in Chongqing, China|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|language=en|volume=58|issue=34|pages=4267–4276|doi=10.1007/s11434-013-5814-2|issn=1001-6538|bibcode=2013ChSBu..58.4267W}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other studies have shown an even higher difference in the report of sick building syndrome symptoms in women compared to men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is not entirely clear, however, if this is due to biological, social, or occupational factors.

A 2001 study published in the Journal Indoor Air 2001 gathered 1464 office-working participants to increase the scientific understanding of gender differences under the Sick Building Syndrome phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brasche|first=S.|last2=Bullinger|first2=M.|last3=Morfeld|first3=M.|last4=Gebhardt|first4=H.

The study team found that across most test variables, prevalence rates were different in most areas, but there was also a deep stratification of working conditions between genders as well. For example, men’s workplace tend to be significantly larger and have all around better job characteristics. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, there was a noticeable difference in reporting rates, finding that women have higher rates of reporting roughly 20% higher than men. This information was similar to that found in previous studies, indicating a potential difference in willingness to report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There might be a [[gender]] difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men do. Along with this, some studies have found that women have a more responsive immune system and are more prone to mucosal dryness and facial [[erythema]]. Also, women are alleged by some to be more exposed to indoor environmental factors because they have a greater tendency to have clerical jobs, wherein they are exposed to unique office equipment and materials (example: [[blueprint]] machines), whereas men often have jobs based outside of offices.&lt;ref&gt;Godish, Thad (2001).

==History==
{{or-section|date=August 2017}}
In the late 1970s, it was noted that nonspecific symptoms were reported by tenants in newly constructed homes, offices, and nurseries. In media it was called "office illness". The term "Sick Building Syndrome" was coined by the WHO in 1986, when they also estimated that 10-30% of newly built office buildings in the West had indoor air problems. Early Danish and British studies reported symptoms.

Poor indoor environments attracted attention. The Swedish allergy study (SOU 1989:76) designated "sick building" as a cause of the allergy epidemic as was feared. In the 1990s, therefore, extensive research into "sick building" was carried out. Various physical and chemical factors in the buildings were examined on a broad front.

The problem was highlighted increasingly in media and was described as a "ticking time bomb". Many studies were performed in individual buildings.

In the 1990s "sick buildings" were contrasted against "[[healthy building]]s". The chemical contents of building materials were highlighted. Many building material manufacturers were actively working to gain control of the chemical content and to replace criticized additives. The ventilation industry advocated above all more well-functioning ventilation. Others perceived ecological construction, natural materials, and simple techniques as a solution.

At the end of the 1990s came an increased distrust of the concept of "sick building". A dissertation at the ''Karolinska Institutet'' in Stockholm 1999 questioned the methodology of previous research, and a Danish study from 2005 showed these flaws experimentally. It was suggested that sick building syndrome was not really a coherent syndrome and was not a disease to be individually diagnosed. In 2006 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommended in the medical journal ''[[Läkartidningen]]'' that "sick building syndrome" should not be used as a clinical diagnosis. Thereafter, it has become increasingly less common to use terms such as "sick buildings" and "sick building syndrome" in research. However, the concept remains alive in popular culture and is used to designate the set of symptoms related to poor home or work environment engineering. "Sick building" is therefore an expression used especially in the context of workplace health.

Sick building syndrome made a rapid journey from media to courtroom where professional engineers and architects became named defendants and were represented by their respective professional practice insurers. Proceedings invariably relied on expert witnesses, medical and technical experts along with building managers, contractors and manufacturers of finishes and furnishings, testifying as to cause and effect. Most of these actions resulted in sealed settlement agreements, none of these being dramatic. The insurers needed a defense based upon Standards of Professional Practice to meet a court decision that declared—that in a modern, essentially sealed building, the HVAC systems must produce breathing air for suitable human consumption. ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers, currently with over 50,000 international members) undertook the task of codifying its IAQ (Indoor Air Quality) standard.

ASHRAE empirical research determined that "acceptability" was a function of outdoor (fresh air) ventilation rate and used carbon dioxide as an accurate measurement of occupant presence and activity. Building odors and contaminants would be suitably controlled by this dilution methodology. ASHRAE codified a level of 1,000 ppm of carbon dioxide and specified the use of widely available sense-and-control equipment to assure compliance. The 1989 issue of ASHRAE 62.1-1989 published the whys and wherefores and overrode the 1981 requirements that were aimed at a ventilation level of 5,000 ppm of carbon dioxide, (the OAHA workplace limit), federally set to minimize HVAC system energy consumption. This apparently ended the SBS epidemic.

Over time, building materials changed with respect to emissions potential. Smoking vanished and dramatic improvements in ambient air quality, coupled with code compliant ventilation and maintenance, per ASHRAE standards have all contributed to the acceptability of the indoor air environment. Only time and the courts will tell how right, or wrong ASHRAE is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pdfs/sick_building_factsheet.pdf|title=Sick Building Syndrome - Fact Sheet|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]| accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title=Sick Building Syndrome |publisher=[[National Health Service]], England|accessdate=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Temperate rainforests''' are [[conifer]]ous or [[broadleaf]] [[forests]] that occur in the [[temperate zone]] and receive heavy [[rainfall]]. 

Temperate rain forests occur in oceanic moist regions around the world: the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of [[North America|North American]] [[Pacific Northwest]]; the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] of southwestern [[South America]]; the rain forests of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]] and southeastern [[Australia]]; [[northwest Europe]] (small pockets in the [[British Isles]], [[Iceland]], and larger areas in southern [[Norway]] and northern [[Iberia]]); southern [[Japan]]; and the eastern [[Black Sea]]-[[Caspian Sea]] region of [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and northern [[Iran]]. 

The moist conditions of temperate rain forests generally support an understory of [[moss]]es, [[fern]]s and some shrubs. Temperate rain forests can be [[temperate coniferous forests]] or [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]]s.

==Definition==
[[File:Termas_geometricas.jpg|right|300px|thumb| Humid temperate rain forest in Termas Geométricas near [[Coñaripe]], Chile]]
For temperate rain forests of North America, Alaback's definition&lt;ref name=Alaback/&gt; is widely recognized:&lt;ref name=Definition&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inforain.org/rainforestatlas/rainforestatlas_page2.html|title=A Review of Past and Current Research|publisher=Ecotrust|accessdate=2008-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6E8TaBIav?url=http://www.inforain.org/rainforestatlas/rainforestatlas_page2.html|archivedate=2013-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over {{convert|140|cm|in|abbr=on}}
: Mean annual temperature is between 4 and 12&amp;nbsp;°C (39 and 54&amp;nbsp;°F).
However, required annual precipitation depends on factors such as distribution of rainfall over the year, temperatures over the year and fog presence, and definitions in other regions of the world differ considerably. For example, Australian definitions are [[ecological]]-structural rather than [[climatic]]:
: Closed [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] of [[tree]]s excludes at least 70% of the sky.
: Forest is composed mainly of tree [[species]] which do not require fire for regeneration, but with [[seedling]]s able to regenerate under shade and in natural openings.&lt;ref name=Floyd&gt;Floyd, A. (1990) ''Australian Rainforests in New South Wales'', Vol. 1. Surrey Beatty &amp; Sons Pty Ltd, Chipping Norton, NSW, {{ISBN|0949324302}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The latter would, for example, exclude a part of the temperate rain forests of western North America, as [[Coast Douglas-fir]], one of its dominant tree species, requires stand-destroying disturbance to initiate a new cohort of seedlings.&lt;ref name=Pseudotsuga&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/psemenm/all.html#BOTANICAL%20AND%20ECOLOGICAL%20CHARACTERISTICS |title=Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|publisher=USDA Forest Service|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American definition would in turn exclude a part of temperate rain forests under definitions used elsewhere.

==Canopy level==
For [[forests]], [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] refers to the upper layer or [[habitat]] zone, formed by mature [[tree crowns]] and including other biological organisms ([[neophytes]], [[lanais]], [[arboreal animals]], etc.). The canopy level is the third level of the [[temperate rainforest]]. The trees forming the canopy, [[conifers]], can stand as tall as 100 meters or more. A variety of species survive in the canopy. The tops of these trees collect most of the rain, moisture, and photosynthesis that the [[rainforest]] takes in. They form a canopy over the forest, covering about 95% of the floor during the summer.

The canopy’s coverage affects the [[shade tolerance]] levels of forest floor plants. When the canopy is in full bloom, covering about 95% of the floor, plant survival decreases. Some plant species have become shade tolerant in order to survive. 
The treetops take in the heavy amount of rain and keep the lower levels of the forest damp.

The canopy survives through [[photosynthesis]]. The leaves provide energy and nutrients for the trees, which provide homes and food for the forest. Through satellite data, the radiation use efficiency(RUE) calculates the annual amount of [[photosynthesis]] that occurs in [[temperate rainforests]]. A diverse amount of [[photosynthesis]] occurs based on the location and [[microclimates]] of the forest.

==Global distribution==
[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|450px|A map showing the areas of temperate rain forest]]
Temperate forests cover a large part of the Earth, but temperate rainforests only occur in a few regions around the world. Most of these occur in oceanic moist climates: the [[Pacific temperate rain forest (WWF ecoregion)|Pacific temperate rain forests]] in Western [[North America]] (Southeastern [[Alaska]] to Central [[California]]), the [[Valdivian temperate rainforests|Valdivian]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests|Magellanic]] temperate rainforests of southwestern [[South America]] (Southern [[Chile]] and adjacent [[Argentina]]), pockets of rain forest in [[Northwestern Europe]] (southern [[Norway]] to northern [[Iberia]]), temperate rainforests of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the [[New Zealand]] temperate rainforests ([[South Island]]'s west coast).

Others occur in subtropical moist climates; [[South Africa]]'s [[Knysna-Amatole coastal forests]], the Colchan rainforests of the eastern [[Black Sea]] region ([[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), the Caspian temperate rainforests of [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]], the mountain temperate rainforests along eastern [[Taiwan]]'s Pacific coast, the eastern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]] along the length of the [[Baekdudaegan|Baekdu Mountain Range]] and in the area surrounding [[Jirisan|Mt. Jiri]] and across the peninsula's southern coastline, southwest [[Japan]]'s Taiheiyo forests, coastal [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand's [[North Island]].

Additionally pockets of temperate rainforest occur in dreary climates that are not categorized by just annual precipitation but also number of cloudy days as well as number of days of measurable precipitation in the form of rain or snow.  In Western North America outside the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Columbia Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]] (BC), northern [[Idaho]] and northwestern [[Montana]], have more of a continental climate and have pockets of temperate coniferous rainforest.

In Eastern North America, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest also exist along the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and adjacent parts of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from [[West Virginia]] to [[New England]]. These areas include sections of West Virginia, Western Pennsylvania, as well as Western [[Upstate New York]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]].  A good example of these forests are found in [[Zoar Valley]] in [[Western New York]] (nearest major city is [[Buffalo, New York]]), [[Cook Forest State Park]] within the [[Allegheny National Forest]] (nearest major city is [[Pittsburgh]]), and [[Cathedral State Park]] in West Virginia. 

In Eastern Asia, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest in what is known as the [[Russian Far East]] ([[Ussuri]], [[Outer Manchuria]], [[Sakhalin]]) in [[Asia]] where the climate is also continental in nature, but get enough precipitation and cloud cover to harbor significant pockets of temperate rainforest.  Like Eastern North America, much precipitation is in the form of rain and snow. The mountainous coniferous forests of the [[Changbai Mountains]] bordering [[China]] and [[North Korea]] are also a good example, containing some of the richest high-elevation coniferous evergreen forests in [[East Asia]].

A portion of the temperate rain forest region of [[North America]], the largest area of temperate zone rain forests on the planet, is the [[Pacific temperate rain forests ecoregion]] which occur on    west-facing [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coastal mountains]] along the Pacific coast of [[North America]], from [[Kodiak Island]] in [[Alaska]] to northern [[California]], and are part of the [[Nearctic]] ecozone.  In the different system established by the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]], this same general region is classed as the [[Pacific Maritime Ecozone (CEC)|Pacific Maritime Ecozone]] by [[Environment Canada]] and as the [[List of ecoregions in the United States (EPA)#Marine West Coast Forest|Marine West Coast Forest]] and [[List of ecoregions in the United States (EPA)#Marine West Coast Forest|Northwestern Forested Mountains]] Level II ecoregions by the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]].  In terms of the [[floristic province]] system used by [[botany]], the bulk of the region is the [[Rocky Mountain Floristic Region]] but a small southern portion is part of the [[California Floristic Province]].
[[File:Redwood National Park, fog in the forest.jpg|thumb|[[Sequoia sempervirens|Coast Redwood]] forest in [[Redwood National Park]]]]

Sub-ecoregions of the Pacific temperate rain forest ecoregion as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF]] include the [[Northern Pacific coastal forests (WWF ecoregion)|Northern Pacific coastal forests]], [[Queen Charlotte Islands|Queen Charlotte Islands ecoregion]], [[Vancouver Island|Vancouver Island ecoregion]],  [[British Columbia mainland coastal forests (WWF ecoregion)|British Columbia mainland coastal forests]], [[Central Pacific coastal forests (WWF ecoregion)|Central Pacific coastal forests]], [[Central and Southern Cascades forests (WWF ecoregion)|Southern Cascades forests ecoregion]], [[Klamath-Siskiyou forests (WWF ecoregion)|Klamath-Siskiyou coastal forests]], and [[Northern California coastal forests (WWF ecoregion)|Northern California coastal forests]] ecoregions. They vary in their species composition, but are all predominantly [[coniferous]], sometimes with an [[understory]] of [[broadleaved]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s. Most of the precipitation occurs in winter but summer [[fog]]s moisture is extracted by the trees and produces a [[fog drip]] keeping the forest moist.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;Franklin, J.F. &amp; Dyrness C.T. (1988) ''Natural Vegetation of Oregon and Washington''. Oregon State University Press, {{ISBN|0870713566}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern California coastal forests are home to the [[Coast Redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens''), the world's tallest tree. In the other ecoregions, [[Coast Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''menziesii''), [[Sitka Spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis''), [[Western Hemlock]] (''Tsuga heterophylla'') and [[Western redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata'') are the most important tree species. A common feature of Pacific temperate rain forests of North America is the [[Nurse log]], a fallen tree which as it decays, provides ecological facilitation to seedlings.  Trees such as the [[Coast Douglas-fir]], [[Western Hemlock]], [[Western Red Cedar]], [[Pacific Yew]], and [[Vine Maple]] are more closely related to coniferous and deciduous trees in the temperate forests of [[East Asia]].

Some of the largest expanses of old growth are found in [[Olympic National Park]], [[Mount Rainier National Park]], [[Tongass National Forest]], [[Mount St. Helens National Monument]], [[Redwood National Park]], and throughout [[British Columbia]] (including British Columbia's Coastal Mountain Ranges), with the coastal [[Great Bear Rainforest]] containing the largest expanses of old growth temperate rainforest found in the world.

[[British Columbia]]'s [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Cariboo Mountains]], [[Rocky Mountain Trench]] (east of [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]]) and the [[Columbia Mountains]] of Southeastern British Columbia (west of the Canadian [[Rocky Mountains]] that extend into parts of Idaho and Northwestern Montana in the USA), which include the [[Selkirk Mountains]], [[Monashee Mountains]], and the [[Purcell Mountains]], have the largest stretch of interior temperate coniferous rain forests.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Wetbelt – University of Northern British Columbia http://wetbelt.unbc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; These [[inland rainforest]]s have more continental climate with a large proportion of the precipitation falling as snow. Being closer to the Rocky Mountains, there is more of a diverse mammalian fauna. Some of the best interior rain forests are found in [[Mount Revelstoke National Park]] and [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]] in the Columbia Mountains.

====Appalachian temperate rain forests ====
{{main|Appalachian temperate rainforest}}
[[File:Roaring Fork River.jpg|thumb|right|Temperate rain forest in the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].]]
Temperate rain forests are located in the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] where [[Orographic lift|orographic precipitation]] causes weather systems coming from the west and from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to drop more precipitation than in surrounding areas.  The largest of these forest blocks are located in western [[North Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Red spruce and Fraser fir are dominant canopy trees in high mountain areas. In higher elevation (over 1,980 metres (6,500&amp;nbsp;ft)), Fraser fir is dominant, in middle elevation (1,675 to 1,890 metres (5,495 to 6,201&amp;nbsp;ft)) red spruce and Fraser fir grow together, and in lower elevation (1,370 to 1,650 metres (4,490 to 5,410&amp;nbsp;ft)) red spruce is dominant. Yellow birch, mountain ash, and mountain maple grow in the understory.Younger spruce and fir and shrubs like raspberry, blackberry, hobblebush, southern mountain cranberries, red elderberry, minniebush, southern bush honeysuckle are understory vegetation. Below the spruce-fir forest, at around 1,200 metres (3,900&amp;nbsp;ft), are forests of American beech, yellow birch, maple birch, and oak.[9] Skunk cabbage and ground juniper are northern species that were pushed into the areas from the north.

The mild and wet environment supports the high diversity of fungi. Over 2,000 species live in this area and scientists estimate many unidentified fungi may be there.[10]

===South America===

====Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests====
{{main|Valdivian temperate rainforests|Magellanic subpolar forests}}
[[File:Bosque de olivillo en Punta Curinanco.jpg|230px|thumbnail|''[[Aextoxicon punctatum]]'' forest in [[Punta Curiñanco]]]]
The temperate rain forests of [[South America]] are located on the Pacific coast of southern [[Chile]], on the west-facing slopes of the southern Chilean coast range, and the [[Andes Mountains]] in both Chile and [[Argentina]] down to the southern tip of South America, and are part of the [[Neotropic]] ecozone. Temperate rain forests occur in the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregions. The Valdivian rainforests are home to a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, like ''[[Aextoxicon punctatum]]'', ''[[Eucryphia cordifolia]]'', and [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus''), but include many [[conifers]] as well, notably [[Fitzroya|Alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), one of the largest tree species of the world.

The Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only temperate rain forests in [[South America]]. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of [[North America]]. The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the [[Antarctic flora]], and share many plant [[Family (biology)|families]] and [[genera]] with the temperate rainforests of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Australia]]. Fully half the species of woody plants are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to this ecoregion.

In the Valdivian region the Andean Cordillera intercepts moist westerly winds along the Pacific coast during winter and summer months; these winds cool as they ascend the mountains, creating heavy rainfall on the mountains' west-facing slopes. The northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. The tree line is at about 2,400&amp;nbsp;m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35°S), and descends to 1,000&amp;nbsp;m in the south of the [[Los Ríos Region|Valdivian region]]. In the summer the temperature can climb to {{convert|16.5|C|abbr=on}}, while during winter the temperature can drop below {{convert|7|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Di Castri, F and Hajek, E. (1976) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080411125445/http://svsch.ceachile.cl/biblioteca_archivos/Bioclimatologia%20de%20Chile.pdf "Bioclimatología de Chile"], 163 pages with English summary, Catholic University of Chile.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===

====Knysna-Amatole coastal rain forests (South Africa)====
[[File:Groot River.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Knysna Forest Biome near [[Nature's Valley]], in the [[Tsitsikamma]], [[South Africa]]]]
The temperate rainforests of [[South Africa]] are part of the [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Knysna-Amatole forests]] that are located along South Africa's [[Garden Route]] between Cape Town and Durban on the south-facing slopes of South Africa's Drakensberg Mountains facing the Indian Ocean.  There are several coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] that grow here. This forest receives a lot of moisture as fog from the Indian Ocean, and resembles not only other temperate rain forests worldwide, but also the montane evergreen [[Afromontane]] forests that occur at higher elevations in southern and eastern Africa. A fine example of this forest is in South Africa's [[Tsitsikamma National Park]].

===Europe===
Temperate rainforest occurs in fragments across the north and west of Europe in countries such as southern [[Norway]] (see [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]]) and northern [[Spain]]. Other temperate rainforest regions include areas of south eastern Europe such as mountains on the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]], surrounding North Western [[Bulgaria]] along with the [[Black Sea]].

====Atlantic Oakwood forest (United Kingdom and Ireland)====
The woodlands are variously referred to in Britain as Upland Oakwoods, Atlantic Oakwoods, Western Oakwoods or Temperate Rainforest, [[Caledonian forest]], and colloquially as 'Celtic Rainforests'. They are also listed in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]] as [[British NVC community W11]] and [[British NVC community W17]] depending on the ground flora. The majority of surviving fragments of Atlantic Oakwoods in Britain occur on steep-sided slopes above rivers and lakes which have avoided clearance and intensive grazing pressure. There are notable examples on the islands and shores of Loch Maree, Loch Sunart, Loch Lomond and one of the best preserved sites on the remote Taynish Peninsula in Argyll. There are also small areas on steep-sided riverine gorges in Snowdonia and Mid Wales. In England, they occur in the Lake District (Borrowdale Woods) and steep-sided riverine and estuarine valleys in Devon and Cornwall including the [[Fowey]] valley in Cornwall and the valley of the [[river Dart]] which flows off Dartmoor and has rainfall in excess of 2&amp;nbsp;metres per year.&lt;ref name="UK Government Met Office"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109134904/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/rainfall.html UK Government Met Office].

====Colchian (Colchis) rain forests (Bulgaria, Turkey and Georgia)====

The Colchian rainforests are found around both the southeast and west corners of the Black Sea starting in [[Bulgaria]] all the way to [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and are part of the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]] ecoregion, together with the drier Euxine forests further west. The Colchian rain forests are mixed, with deciduous [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]] ''(Alnus glutinosa)'', hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]'' and ''[[Carpinus orientalis|C. orientalis]]''), [[Oriental beech]] (''Fagus orientalis''), and [[sweet chestnut]] ''(Castanea sativa)'' together with evergreen [[Nordmann fir]] (''Abies nordmanniana'', the tallest tree in Europe at 78 m), [[Caucasian spruce]] (''Picea orientalis'') and [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris'').
The refugium is the largest throughout the Western Asian / near Eastern region.&lt;ref&gt;Zazanashvili N, Sanadiradze G, Bukhnikashvili A, Kandaurov A, Tarkhnishvili D. (2004).

In general, species composition of this refugium is quite distinct and differs from that of the other Western Eurasian refugia.&lt;ref name=tgm /&gt; 
Genetic data suggest that the Colchis temperate rainforest, during the [[Ice Age]], was fragmented into smaller parts; in particular, evolutionary lineages of the [[Caucasian Salamander]] from the central and south-western Colchis remained isolated from one another during the entire Ice Age.&lt;ref name=Tarkhnishvili/&gt;

====Fragas do Eume (Spain)====
The [[Fragas do Eume]] is a natural park situated in [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]], north-western [[Spain]]. ''Fraga'' is a [[Galician language|Galician]] word for "natural woodland", (old-growth forest) and the park is an example of a temperate rainforest in which oak ([[Quercus robur]] and [[Quercus pyrenaica]]) is the [[climax vegetation]]. The protected area extends along the valley of the river Eume within the [[Ferrolterra]] municipalities of [[Pontedeume]], [[Cabanas, Galicia|Cabanas]], [[A Capela, Galicia|A Capela]], [[Monfero]] and [[As Pontes de García Rodríguez]]. Some 500 people reside within the park. The monastery of [[Saint John of Caaveiro]] also lies within the park.
The area was declared a [[Natural park (Spain)|natural park]] (a level of protection lower than [[national park]]) in 1997. It is one of six natural parks in Galicia. The European Union has recognised the park as a [[Site of Community Importance]]. There are a number of species of ferns. Invertebrate species include the [[Kerry slug]] and it is an important site for amphibians.

===Asia===

====Caspian Hyrcanian forest (Iran and Azerbaijan)====
The [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]] ecoregion in northern [[Iran]] contains a jungle in the form of a rain forest which stretches from the east in the [[Khorasan province]] to the west in the [[Ardebil]] province, covering the other provinces of [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]], and [[Golestan Province|Golestan]].  The Elburz or [[Alborz]] mountain range is the highest mountain range in the [[Middle East]] which captures the moisture of the [[Caspian Sea]] to its north and forms [[subtropical]] and temperate rain forests in the northern part of [[Iran]]. The Iranians call this forest and region ''Shomal'' which means ''north'' in [[Persian language|Persian]].

In southeast [[Azerbaijan]], this ecoregion includes the [[Lankaran Lowland]] and the [[Talysh Mountains]], the latter being evenly divided with Iran to the south. They are [[deciduous]] forests containing tree species such as black alder (''[[Alnus glutinosa]]'' subsp. ''barbata''), hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]'' and ''[[Carpinus orientalis|C. orientalis]]''), Caucasian wingnut (''[[Pterocarya fraxinifolia]]''), chestnut-leaved oak (''[[Quercus castaneifolia]]''), Caucasian oak (''[[Quercus macranthera]]''), oriental beech (''[[Fagus orientalis]]''), Persian ironwood (''[[Parrotia persica]]'') and Persian silk tree (''[[Albizia julibrissin]]'').

The existing protected areas in Azerbaijan include:

* [[Gizil-Agach State Reserve]] – {{convert|88.4|km2|mi2}}
* [[Hirkan National Park]] – {{convert|427.97|km2|mi2}}
* [[Zuvand National Park]] – {{convert|15|km2|mi2}}
* [[Girkan State Reserve]] – {{convert|3|km2|mi2}}

====High elevation mountain rain forests (Taiwan)====
These forests are found in eastern Taiwan and Taiwan's Central Mountain Ranges, part of the [[Taiwan subtropical evergreen forest]] region covering the higher elevations. Most of the lower elevations are covered by subtropical broadleaf evergreen forests, dominated by Chinese Cryptocarya (''[[Cryptocarya chinensis]]''), ''[[Castanopsis hystrix]]'' and Japanese Blue Oak (''[[Quercus glauca]]''). Higher elevations give way to temperate forests with large stands of [[old growth]] Taiwan Cypress (''[[Chamaecyparis taiwanensis]]''), Camphor tree (''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]''), maple (''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'' spp.), Chinese yew (''[[Taxus chinensis]]''), Taiwan Hemlock (''[[Tsuga chinensis]]''), and Taiwan Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga sinensis]] var. wilsoniana''). These higher elevation forests include also giant conifers Formosan Cypress (''[[Chamaecyparis formosensis]]'') and Taiwania (''[[Taiwania cryptomerioides]]'') Some fine examples of forests are found in Yushan ([[Jade Mountain]]) National Park and [[Alishan National Scenic Area|Alishan]].&lt;ref name=Taiwan&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=im0172 |name=Taiwan subtropical evergreen forests|accessdate=2008-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=farjon&gt;Farjon, A.

[[File:Baemsagol MS3812.JPG|right|230px|thumb|Baemsagol vally of [[Jirisan]], which is the southern end of Baekdu Mountain Range.]]

The forests that cover the mountains and valleys of the [[Baekdudaegan|Baekdu Mountain Range]] – from [[Baekdusan|Mt. Baekdu]], in the north, to [[Jirisan|Mt. Jiri]], in the southwest, forming the spine of the [[Korean Peninsula]] – and the [[South Sea (Korea)|southern coast and islands]] of the peninsula – including [[Jeju Island]] – feature a wide variety of conifers and broadleaf trees. Much of these forests are protected in mountain and marine national forests, such as in [[Hallyeohaesang National Park]], which encompasses 150.14 km2 of mountainous forests spread out over 69 uninhabited islands and 30 inhabited islands in [[South Sea (Korea)|Korea's South Sea]] that provide a home to 1,142 plant species, including major species such as red pine, black pine, common camellia, serrata oak, and cork oak, as well as rare species such as nadopungnan (sedirea japonica), daeheongnan (cymbidium nipponicum) and the Korean winter hazel. Major animals species, such as otters, small-eared cats, and badgers also call Hallyeohaesang National Park home, and overall there are 25 mammal species, 115 bird species, 16 reptile species, 1,566 insect species, and 24 freshwater fish species found among the forested, mountains islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hallyeohaesang National Park|url=http://english.knps.or.kr/Knp/Hallyeohaesang/Intro/Introduction.aspx?MenuNum=1&amp;Submenu=Npp|website=Korea National Park Service|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seoraksan National Park]] covers 398.539㎢ of mountainous forests near the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, and is a [[UNESCO]] designated Biosphere Preservation District. Over 2,000 animal species live in Seoraksan, including the Korean goral, musk deer, and there are also more than 1,400 rare plant species, such as the edelweiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seoraksan National Park|url=http://english.knps.or.kr/Knp/Seoraksan/Intro/Introduction.aspx?MenuNum=1&amp;Submenu=Npp|website=Korea National Park Service|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southwestern [[Japan]]'s [[Taiheiyo evergreen forests]] region covers much of [[Shikoku]] and [[Kyūshū]] Islands, and the Southern/Pacific Ocean-facing side of [[Honshu]] ("Taiheiyo" is the [[Pacific Ocean]], in Japanese). Here the natural forests are mainly [[broadleaf]] [[evergreen]] in lower [[elevation]]s and [[deciduous]] in higher elevations. The [[hydrangea hirta]] species is an endemic deciduous species that can be found in this area. The limit occurs at 500–1000&amp;nbsp;metres depending on [[latitude]].&lt;ref name=Satoo&gt;Satoo, T. (1983). ''Temperate broad-leaved evergreen forests of Japan''. In: Ovington, J.V. (ed.) ''Ecosystems of the world 10: Temperate broad-leaved evergreen forests'', pp. 169–189. Elsevier, Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt; The main tree species are members of beech [[Family (biology)|family]] ([[Fagaceae]]). In lower altitudes these include evergreen oaks (''[[Oak|Quercus]]'' spp.), Japanese Chinquapin (''[[Castanopsis cuspidata]]'') and Japanese Stone Oak (''[[Lithocarpus edulis]]''),&lt;ref name=Satoo/&gt; and in higher altitudes Japanese Blue Beech (''[[Fagus japonica]]'') and Siebold's beech (''[[Fagus crenata]]'').&lt;ref name=Ching&gt;Ching, K.K.

Some of the best preserved examples of forest are found in [[Kirishima-Yaku National Park]] on the Island of [[Yakushima]] off of [[Kyūshū]] in a very wet [[climate]] (the annual [[rainfall]] is 4,000 to 10,000&amp;nbsp;mm depending on [[altitude]]). Because of relatively infertile [[soil]]s on [[granite]], Yakushima's forests in higher elevations are dominated by a giant [[conifer]] species, Japanese Cedar (''[[Cryptomeria japonica]]''), rather than deciduous forests typical of the mainland.&lt;ref name=farjon/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yakushima&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/yaku.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718173307/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/yaku.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-18 |title=Yakushima – Natural site datasheet from WCMC |publisher=World Conservation Monitoring Centre |accessdate=2008-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas include [[Mount Kirishima]] near [[Kagoshima]] in southern Kyūshū.

====Australian temperate rainforests====
{{see also|Eastern Australian temperate forests|Rainforest in Victoria (Australia)}}

In [[Australia]] rainforests occur near the mainland east coast and in [[Tasmania]]. There are warm-temperate and cool-temperate rainforests. They are [[broadleaf]] [[evergreen]] forests with the exception of [[Montane forest|montane]] rainforests of Tasmania. [[Eucalyptus|Eucalypt]] forests are not classified as rainforests although some eucalypt forest types receive high annual [[rainfall]] (to over 2000&amp;nbsp;mm in [[Tasmania]]&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, J. B. and Hill, R. S. (2005) ''Vegetation of Tasmania'', Australian Biological Resources Study, {{ISBN|064644512X}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and in the absence of [[Wildfire|fire]] they may develop to rainforest. If these widespread [[wet sclerophyll]] forests were considered rainforests, the total area of rainforest in Australia would be much larger.

Warm-temperate rainforest replaces subtropical rainforest on poorer soils or with increasing altitude and latitude in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  Cool-temperate rainforests are widespread in Tasmania ([[Tasmanian temperate rain forests]] ecoregion) and they can be found scattered from the [[World Heritage]] listed [[Border Ranges National Park]] and [[Lamington National Park]] on the NSW/Queensland border to [[Otway Ranges]], [[Strzelecki Ranges]], [[Dandenong Ranges]] and [[Tarra Bulga]] in Victoria. In the northern NSW they are usually dominated by Antarctic Beech (''[[Nothofagus moorei]]''), in the southern NSW by Pinkwood (''[[Eucryphia moorei]]'') and Coachwood (''[[Ceratopetalum apetalum]]'') and in Victoria and Tasmania by Myrtle Beech (''[[Nothofagus cunninghamii]]''), Southern Sassafras (''[[Atherosperma moschatum]]'') and Mountain Ash (''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'').&lt;ref name=harden&gt;Harden, G., McDonald, B. &amp; Williams, J. (2006). ''Rainforest Trees and Shrubs.''

====New Zealand temperate rainforests====
The temperate rainforests of New Zealand occur on the western shore of the [[South Island]] and on the [[North Island]]. The forests are made up of coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] and broadleaf evergreen trees. The podocarps are abundant at lower elevations, while [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus'') can be found on higher slopes and in the cooler southernmost rainforests. Ecoregions include the [[Fiordland temperate forests]] and [[Westland temperate rainforests]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2698">{{For|other figures named Thyia|Thyia (mythology)}}In [[Greek mythology]], '''Thyia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|aɪ|ə}}; {{lang-grc|Θυία}} ''Thuia'' derived from the verb ''θύω'' "to sacrifice") was a female figure associated with cults of several major gods.  

== Mythology ==
In the [[Delphi]]c tradition, Thyia was also the [[naiad]] of a spring on [[Mount Parnassos]] in [[Phocis]] (central Greece), daughter of the river god [[Cephissus (Boeotia)|Cephissus]].&lt;ref name="Hdt." /&gt; Her shrine was the site for the gathering of the '''Thyiades''' (women who celebrated in the orgies of the god [[Dionysos]]). She was said to have been the first to sacrifice to Dionysus, and to celebrate orgies in his honour. Hence, the [[Attica|Attic]] women, who every year went to Mount Parnassus to celebrate the Dionysiac orgies with the Delphian Thyiades, received themselves the name of Thyades or Thyiades (synonymous with [[Maenads]]).&lt;ref name="Paus. 10. 6. 4" /&gt;

She was said to have loved [[Apollo]] and bore him a son, [[Delphus|Delphos]], the eponymous founder of town [[Delphi]], beside the oracular shrine. She was also closely associated with the prophetic [[Castalian Spring]], from which she was sometimes said to have been born (Pausanias follows a tradition that made her daughter of the [[autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthon]] [[Castalius (mythology)|Castalius]]). Thyia was also related to [[Castalia]], the nymph of the spring; Melaena, an alternative mother for Delphos; and the [[Corycian nymphs]], Naiades of the springs of the holy [[Corycian Cave]].&lt;ref name="Paus. 10. 6. 4"&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' 10. 6. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Thyia was also reported to have had an affair with [[Poseidon]], and to have been a close friend of [[Chloris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', 10. 25. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

A sacred precinct of Thyia was reported to have been located in the city of the same name, with an altar to the [[Anemoi]] set up during the [[Greco-Persian Wars]].&lt;ref name="Hdt."&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''Histories'' 7. 178. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was applied to the [[Thuja occidentalis|white cedar]] and its genus,  ''[[Thuja]]'', by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] (1753).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4775">'''The Tree of Peace''' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]: Strom pokoja, [[Russian language|Russian]]: Дерево мира) is an international project that originated in [[Slovakia]]. The project was created on the occasion of the 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary of the end of Great War Conflict – [[World War I]] and was initiated by garden architect [[Marek Sobola]] from [[Žilina]]. The idea of the project is generally a message of peace. The project ambition is to plant The Tree of Peace on every continent within 4 years (2018 – 2022). As the Global War Conflict (WWI) lasted for 4 years this project could last for 4 years as well. On the contrary to the WWI this project is going to join people around the world.

== Background of the project ==
World War I also had an impact on family of Marek Sobola. Personally, was touched of his great-grandfather [[Andreas Sobola]]. He died during the WWI on the Russian battlefield. Andreas was born on August 7, 1880 in the Village [[Divinka|Lalinok]] near Žilina an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian–Hungarian Empire]] that time. He was enlisted in the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Military Infantry Regiment and was missing since c. 1915 on the Russian battlefield. Andreas died in an unknown place. In the [[Czechoslovakia]], he was officially pronounced dead in 1930, with the official date of death: 31&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December 1918. The story of his family inspired Marek Sobola to the idea of this project. This story was repeated millions of times during the WWI. The project is realized in memory of all soldiers who died in WWI in unknown places without name and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sobola.sk/strom-pokoja-prvy-strom-zasadeny/|title=The first Tree of Peace has already been planted / Strom pokoja: prvý strom zasadený|last=Sobola|first=Marek|date=|website=sobola.sk|language=sk-SK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''XMM-Newton''''', also known as the '''High Throughput X-ray Spectroscopy Mission''' and the '''X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission''', is an [[X-ray]] [[space observatory]] launched by the [[European Space Agency]] in December 1999 on an [[Ariane 5]] rocket. It is the second cornerstone mission of ESA's [[Horizon 2000]] programme. Named after physicist and astronomer Sir [[Isaac Newton]], the spacecraft is tasked with investigating interstellar X-ray sources, performing narrow- and broad-range [[spectroscopy]], and performing the first simultaneous imaging of objects in both X-ray and optical ([[visible spectrum|visible]] and [[ultraviolet]]) wavelengths.&lt;ref name="xmm-objectives"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31355-objectives/ |title=XMM-Newton: Objectives |publisher=European Space Agency |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally scheduled for a two-year mission, the spacecraft remains in good health and has received repeated mission extensions, most recently for one year through 2016&lt;ref name="esa20141120"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/54999-working-life-extensions-for-esas-science-missions/ |title=Working life extensions for ESA's science missions |publisher=European Space Agency |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for two years through 2018.&lt;ref name="esa20161122"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/58589-two-year-extensions-confirmed-for-esa-s-science-missions/ |title=Two-Year Extensions Confirmed for ESA's Science Missions |publisher=European Space Agency |first1=Martin |last1=Kessler |first2=Fabio |last2=Favata |first3=Markus |last3=Bauer |date=22 November 2016 |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESA plans to succeed ''XMM-Newton'' with the [[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics]] (ATHENA), the second large mission in the [[Cosmic Vision]] 2015-2025 plan, to be launched in 2028.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Athena_to_study_the_hot_and_energetic_Universe |title=Athena to study the hot and energetic Universe |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Markus |last=Bauer |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''XMM-Newton'' is similar to [[NASA]]'s [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], also launched in 1999.

As of May 2018, close to 5,600 [[academic paper|papers]] have been published about either ''XMM-Newton'' or the scientific results it has returned.&lt;ref name="xmm-papers"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/332006/1713846/mission_status.pdf |title=XMM-Newton Overall Mission Status |conference=XMM-Newton Users' Group Meeting #19. 17-18 May 2018.

== Concept and mission history ==
The observational scope of ''XMM-Newton'' includes the [[X-ray astronomy|detection of X-ray]] emissions from astronomical objects, detailed studies of star-forming regions, investigation of the formation and evolution of [[galaxy cluster]]s, the environment of [[supermassive black hole]]s and mapping of the mysterious [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="bulletin141"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/ESA-Bulletin-141/pageflip.html |title=10 years of discovery: Commemorating XMM-Newton's first decade |journal=ESA Bulletin |first1=Norbert |last1=Schartel |first2=María |last2=Santos-Lleo |first3=Arvind |last3=Parmar |first4=Jean |last4=Clavel |issue=141 |pages=2–9 |date=February 2010 |issn=0376-4265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''XMM'' left the ESTEC integration facility on 9 September 1999, taken by road to [[Katwijk]] then by the barge ''Emeli'' to [[Rotterdam]].

During a press conference on 9 February 2000, ESA presented the first images taken by ''XMM'' and announced that a new name had been chosen for the spacecraft. Whereas the program had formally been known as the High Throughput X-ray Spectroscopy Mission, the new name would reflect the nature of the program and the originator of the field of spectroscopy. Explaining the new name of ''XMM-Newton'', Roger Bonnet, ESA's former Director of Science, said, "We have chosen this name because Sir Isaac Newton was the man who invented spectroscopy and XMM is a spectroscopy mission." He noted that because Newton is synonymous with gravity and one of the goals of the satellite was to locate large numbers of black hole candidates, "there was no better choice than XMM-Newton for the name of this mission."&lt;ref name="xmm-fact-sheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31250-fact-sheet/ |title=XMM-Newton: Fact Sheet |publisher=European Space Agency |date=21 December 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including all construction, spacecraft launch, and two years of operation, the project was accomplished within a budget of {{€|689 million|link=yes}} (1999 conditions).&lt;ref name="aeat2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lumb2012"/&gt;

Because of the spacecraft's good health and the significant returns of data, ''XMM-Newton'' has received several mission extensions by ESA's Science Programme Committee. The first extension came during November 2003 and extended operations through March 2008.&lt;ref name="xmm-extend-2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_news/news_list/xmm_news-2003-12-01.shtml |title=XMM-Newton-NEWS #36 |publisher=European Space Agency |date=1 December 2003 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second extension was approved in December 2005, extending work through March 2010.&lt;ref name="xmm-extend-2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/38397-mission-extension-approved/ |title=XMM-Newton Mission Extension Approved |publisher=European Space Agency |date=6 December 2005 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third extension was passed in November 2007, which provided for operations through 2012. As part of the approval, it was noted that the satellite had enough on-board consumables (fuel, power and mechanical health) to theoretically continue operations past 2017.&lt;ref name="xmm-extend-2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/41772-xmm-newton-mission-extension-approved/ |title=XMM-Newton Mission Extension Approved |publisher=European Space Agency |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth extension in November 2010 approved operations through 2014.&lt;ref name="esa20101122"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Europe_maintains_its_presence_on_the_final_frontier |title=Europe maintains its presence on the final frontier |publisher=European Space Agency |date=22 November 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth extension was approved in November 2014, continuing operations through 2018.&lt;ref name="esa20141120"/&gt;

{{anchor|Cooling}}The spacecraft has the ability to lower the operating temperature of both the EPIC and RGS cameras, a function that was included to counteract the deleterious effects of ionising [[radiation]] on the camera [[pixel]]s. In general, the instruments are cooled to reduce the amount of [[dark current (physics)|dark current]] within the devices. During the night of 3–4 November 2002, RGS-2 was cooled from its initial temperature of {{convert|-80|C|F|0}} down to {{convert|-113|C|F|0}}, and a few hours later to {{convert|-115|C|F|0}}. After analysing the results, it was determined the optimal temperature for both RGS units would be {{convert|-110|C|F|0}}, and during 13–14 November, both RGS-1 and RGS-2 were set to this level. During 6–7 November, the EPIC MOS-CCD detectors were cooled from their initial operating temperature of {{convert|-100|C|F|0}} to a new setting of {{convert|-120|C|F|0}}. After these adjustments, both the EPIC and RGS cameras showed dramatic improvements in quality.&lt;ref name="xmm-cam-cooling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_news/items/cooling02/index.shtml |title=First results from XMM-Newton RGS and EPIC MOS instruments cooling |publisher=European Space Agency |date=11 November 2002 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 October 2008, ''XMM-Newton'' suffered an unexpected communications failure, during which time there was no contact with the spacecraft. While some concern was expressed that the vehicle may have suffered a catastrophic event, photographs taken by amateur astronomers at the [[Starkenburg Observatory]] in Germany and at other locations worldwide showed that the spacecraft was intact and appeared on course. A weak signal was finally detected using a {{convert|35|m|ft|adj=on}} antenna in [[New Norcia, Western Australia]], and communication with ''XMM-Newton'' suggested that the spacecraft's Radio Frequency switch had failed. After troubleshooting a solution, ground controllers used [[NASA]]'s {{convert|34|m|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} antenna at the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]] to send a command that changed the switch to its last working position. ESA stated in a press release that on 22 October, a ground station at the [[European Space Astronomy Centre]] (ESAC) made contact with the satellite, confirming the process had worked and that the satellite was back under control.&lt;ref name="aero20081023"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;id=11b62d59-623b-49f2-b8c1-f815b24f9738 |title=ESA Receives An Orbital Call For Help |work=Aero-News.net |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20081022"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/43591-re-establishing-contact-with-xmm-newton/ |title=Re-establishing contact with XMM-Newton |publisher=European Space Agency |date=22 October 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esa20081023"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/XMM-Newton_talks_again_loud_and_clear |title=XMM-Newton talks again loud and clear |publisher=European Space Agency |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spacecraft ==
[[File:XMM-Newton.jpg|thumb|Mock-up of ''XMM-Newton'' at the ''[[Cité de l'espace]]'', [[Toulouse]].]]
''XMM-Newton'' is a {{convert|10.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} long space telescope, and is {{convert|16.16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide with solar arrays deployed. At launch it weighed {{convert|3764|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; The spacecraft has three degrees of stabilisation, which allow it to aim at a target with an accuracy of 0.25 to 1 [[minute of arc|arcseconds]]. This stabilisation is achieved through the use of the spacecraft's [[#AOCS|Attitude &amp; Orbit Control Subsystem]]. These systems also allow the spacecraft to point at different celestial targets, and can turn the craft at a maximum of 90 degrees per hour.&lt;ref name="xmm-overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-fact-sheet" /&gt; The instruments on board ''XMM-Newton'' are three European Photon Imaging Cameras (EPIC), two Reflection Grating [[Spectrometer]]s (RGS), and an Optical Monitor.

The spacecraft is roughly cylindrical in shape, and has four major components. At the fore of the spacecraft is the ''Mirror Support Platform'', which supports the X-ray telescope assemblies and grating systems, the Optical Monitor, and two [[star tracker]]s. Surrounding this component is the ''Service Module'', which carries various spacecraft support systems: [[Bus (computing)|computer]] and [[electric bus]]ses, consumables (such as fuel and [[coolant]]), [[photovoltaic system|solar arrays]], the Telescope Sun Shield, and two [[S band|S-band]] antennas. Behind these units is the ''Telescope Tube'', a {{convert|6.8|m|ft|adj=on}} long, hollow [[carbon fibre]] structure which provides exact spacing between the mirrors and their detection equipment. This section also hosts [[outgassing]] equipment on its exterior, which helps remove any contaminants from the interior of the satellite. At the aft end of spacecraft is the ''Focal Plane Assembly'', which supports the Focal Plane Platform (carrying the cameras and spectrometers) and the data-handling, power distribution, and radiator assemblies.&lt;ref name="bulletin100"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/ESA-Bulletin-100/ |title=An Overview of the XMM Observatory System |journal=Bulletin |publisher=European Space Agency |first1=H. |last1=Barré |first2=H. |last2=Nye |first3=G. |last3=Janin |issue=100 |pages=15–20 |date=December 1999 |bibcode=1999ESABu.100...15B |issn=0376-4265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instruments ==

=== European Photon Imaging Cameras{{anchor|EPIC}} ===
The three ''European Photon Imaging Cameras'' (EPIC) are the primary instruments aboard ''XMM-Newton''. The system is composed of two [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor|MOS]]-[[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras and a single [[p–n junction|pn]]-CCD camera, with a total field of view of 30 [[minute of arc|arcminutes]] and an energy sensitivity range between {{nowrap|0.15 and 15 [[electronvolt|keV]]}} ({{nowrap|82.7 to 0.83 [[ångström]]s}}). Each camera contains a six-position [[optical filter|filter wheel]], with three types of X-ray-transparent filters, a fully open and a fully closed position; each also contains a radioactive source used for internal calibration. The cameras can be independently operated in a variety of modes, depending on the image sensitivity and speed needed, as well as the intensity of the target.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31281-instruments/?fbodylongid=774 |title=XMM-Newton: Instruments: European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-manual-332"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/uhb/epicmode.html |title=Science modes of the EPIC cameras |work=XMM-Newton Users' Handbook |publisher=European Space Agency |page=3.3.2 |id=Issue 2.13 |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm47.pdf |title=The European Photon Imaging Camera on XMM-Newton: The MOS cameras |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=M.

The two MOS-CCD cameras are used to detect low-energy X-rays. Each camera is composed of seven [[silicon chip]]s (one in the centre and six circling it), with each chip containing a matrix of 600×600 [[pixel]]s, giving the camera a total resolution of about 2.5 [[megapixel]]s. As [[#Cooling|discussed above]], each camera has a large adjacent [[radiator]] which cools the instrument to an operating temperature of {{convert|-120|C|F|0}}. They were developed and built by the [[University of Leicester]] Space Research Centre and [[English Electric Valve Company|EEV Ltd]].&lt;ref name="xmm-cam-cooling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2001" /&gt;

The pn-CCD camera is used to detect high-energy X-rays, and is composed of a single silicon chip with twelve individual embedded CCDs. Each CCD is 64×189 pixels, for a total capacity of 145,000 pixels. At the time of its construction, the pn-CCD camera on ''XMM-Newton'' was the largest such device ever made, with a sensitive area of {{convert|36|cm2|abbr=on}}. A radiator cools the camera to {{convert|-100|C|F|0}}. This system was made by the [[University of Tübingen|Astronomisches Institut Tübingen]], the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]], and PNSensor, all of Germany.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pnsensor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnsensor.de/Welcome/Detectors/pn-CCD/index.php |title=Detector Concept of pn-CCDs |website=PNSensor.de |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Struder2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm35.pdf |title=The European Photon Imaging Camera on XMM-Newton: The pn-CCD camera |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=L. |last1=Strüder |first2=U. |last2=Briel |first3=K. |last3=Dennerl |first4=R. |last4=Hartmann |first5=E. |last5=Kendziorra |display-authors=etal |volume=365 |issue=1 |pages=L18-L26 |date=January 2001 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20000066 |bibcode=2001A&amp;A...365L..18S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPIC system records three types of data about every X-ray that is detected by its CCD cameras. The time that the X-ray arrives allows scientists to develop [[light curve]]s, which projects the number of X-rays that arrive over time and shows changes in the brightness of the target. Where the X-ray hits the camera allows for a visible image to be developed of the target. The amount of energy carried by the X-ray can also be detected and helps scientists to determine the physical processes occurring at the target, such as its temperature, its chemical make-up, and what the environment is like between the target and the telescope.&lt;ref name="leicaster-epic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.src.le.ac.uk/projects/xmm/instrument/ |title=The EPIC-MOS instruments on-board XMM-Newton |work=University of Leicester |first=Darren |last=Baskill |date=14 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701101611/http://www.src.le.ac.uk/projects/xmm/instrument/ |archivedate=1 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reflection Grating Spectrometers{{anchor|RGS}} ===
The ''Reflection Grating Spectrometers'' (RGS) are a secondary system on the spacecraft and are composed of two Focal Plane Cameras and their associated Reflection Grating Arrays. This system is used to build [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectral data]] and can determine the [[chemical element|elements]] present in the target, as well as the temperature, quantity and other characteristics of those elements. The RGS system operates in the {{nowrap|2.5 to 0.35 keV}} ({{nowrap|5 to 35 ångström}}) range, which allows detection of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon and iron.&lt;ref name="denHerder2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm19.pdf |title=The Reflection Grating Spectrometer on board XMM-Newton |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=J.

The Focal Plane Cameras each consist of nine MOS-CCD devices mounted in a row and following a curve called a [[Rowland circle]]. Each CCD contains 384×1024 pixels, for a total resolution of more than 3.5 megapixels. The total width and length of the CCD array was dictated by the size of the RGS spectrum and the wavelength range, respectively. Each CCD array is surrounded by a relatively massive wall, providing heat conduction and [[radiation]] shielding. Two-stage radiators cool the cameras to an operating temperature of {{convert|-110|C|F|0}}. The camera systems were a joint effort between [[Netherlands Institute for Space Research|SRON]], the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]], and [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory|MSSL]], with EEV Ltd and Contraves Space providing hardware.&lt;ref name="xmm-cam-cooling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="denHerder2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinkman1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-support-tech-rgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/technical/RGS/index.shtml |title=The Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-rgs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31281-instruments/?fbodylongid=797 |title=XMM-Newton: Instruments: Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reflection Grating Arrays are attached to two of the primary telescopes. They allow approximately 50% of the incoming X-rays to pass unperturbed to the EPIC system, while redirecting the other 50% onto the Focal Plane Cameras. Each RGA was designed to contain 182 identical gratings, though a fabrication error left one with only 181. Because the telescope mirrors have already focused the X-rays to converge at the focal point, each grating has the same angle of incidence, and as with the Focal Plane Cameras, each grating array conforms to a Rowland circle. This configuration minimises focal aberrations. Each {{convert|10|xx|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} grating is composed of {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} thick [[silicon carbide]] substrate covered with a {{convert|2000|Å|adj=on|lk=in}} [[gold]] film, and is supported by five [[beryllium]] stiffeners. The gratings contain a large number of grooves, which actually perform the X-ray deflection; each grating contains an average of 646 grooves per millimetre. The RGAs were built by [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="denHerder2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brinkman1998" /&gt;

=== Optical Monitor{{anchor|OM}} ===
The ''Optical Monitor'' (OM) is a {{convert|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope|Ritchey–Chrétien]] optical/ultraviolet telescope designed to provide simultaneous observations alongside the spacecraft's X-ray instruments. The OM is sensitive between {{nowrap|170 and 650}} nanometres in a 17×17 arcminute square field of view co-aligned with the centre of the X-ray telescope's field of view. It has a [[focal length]] of {{convert|3.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and a [[focal ratio]] of ƒ/12.7.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-om"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31281-instruments/?fbodylongid=798 |title=XMM-Newton: Instruments: Optical Monitor (OM) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=18 August 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason2001"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/01/aaxmm33.pdf |title=The XMM-Newton optical/UV monitor telescope |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=K.

The instrument is composed of the Telescope Module, containing the optics, detectors, processing equipment, and power supply; and the Digital Electronics Module, containing the instrument control unit and data processing units. Incoming light is directed into one of two fully redundant detector systems. The light passes through an 11-position [[optical filter|filter wheel]] (one opaque to block light, six broad band filters, one white light filter, one magnifier, and two [[grism]]s), then through an intensifier which amplifies the light by one million times, then onto the CCD sensor. The CCD is 384×288 pixels in size, of which 256×256 pixels are used for observations; each pixel is further subsampled into 8×8 pixels, resulting in a final product that is 2048×2048 in size. The Optical Monitor was built by the [[Mullard Space Science Laboratory]] with contributions from organisations in the United States and Belgium.&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-om"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mason2001"/&gt;

== Telescopes ==
[[File:Schema-optique-Wolter.png|thumb|Diagram of a Wolter Type 1 optical system]]

Feeding the EPIC and RGS systems are three telescopes designed specifically to direct X-rays into the spacecraft's primary instruments. The telescope assemblies each have a diameter of {{convert|90|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, are {{convert|250|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length, and have a base weight of {{convert|425|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The two telescopes with Reflection Grating Arrays weigh an additional {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Components of the telescopes include (from front to rear) the mirror assembly door, entrance and X-ray [[wikt:baffle|baffles]], mirror module, electron deflector, a Reflection Grating Array in two of the assemblies, and exit baffle.&lt;ref name="aeat2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-mirror-intro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31318-x-ray-mirrors/ |title=XMM-Newton: X-ray Mirrors: Introduction |publisher=European Space Agency |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-mirror-config"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31318-x-ray-mirrors/?fbodylongid=800 |title=XMM-Newton: X-ray Mirrors: Configuration |publisher=European Space Agency |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-mirror-design"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31318-x-ray-mirrors/?fbodylongid=801 |title=XMM-Newton: X-ray Mirrors: Optical Design |publisher=European Space Agency |date=3 April 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each telescope consists of 58 cylindrical, nested [[Wolter telescope|Wolter Type-1 mirrors]] developed by Media Lario of Italy, each {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and ranging in diameter from {{convert|306|to|700|mm|in|abbr=on}}, producing a total collecting area of {{convert|4425|cm2|0|abbr=on}} at 1.5 [[Electronvolt|keV]] and {{convert|1740|cm2|0|abbr=on}} at 8 keV.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; The mirrors range from {{convert|0.47|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick for the innermost mirror to {{convert|1.07|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick for the outermost mirror, and the separation between each mirror ranges from {{convert|1.5|to|4|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} from innermost to outermost.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; Each mirror was built by vapour-depositing a 250&amp;nbsp;nm layer of gold reflecting surface onto a highly polished aluminium [[mandrel]], followed by [[electroforming]] a monolithic [[nickel]] support layer onto the gold. The finished mirrors were glued into the grooves of an [[Inconel]] spider, which keeps them aligned to within the five-micron tolerance required to achieve adequate X-ray resolution. The mandrels were manufactured by [[Carl Zeiss AG]], and the electroforming and final assembly were performed by Media Lario with contributions from [[Kayser-Threde]].&lt;ref name="bulletin089"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/ESA-Bulletin-089/ |title=Producing the X-Ray Mirrors for ESA's XMM spacecraft |journal=Bulletin |publisher=European Space Agency |first1=D. |last1=de Chambure |first2=R. |last2=Lainé |first3=K. |last3=van Katwijk |first4=J. |last4=van Casteren |first5=P. |last5=Glaude |issue=89 |pages=68–79 |date=February 1997 |issn=0376-4265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subsystems ==

=== Attitude &amp; Orbit Control System{{anchor|AOCS}} ===
Spacecraft three-axis [[attitude control]] is handled by the ''Attitude &amp; Orbit Control System'' (AOCS), composed of four [[reaction wheel]]s, four [[inertial measurement unit]]s, two [[star tracker]]s, three fine [[Sun sensor]]s, and three Sun acquisition sensors. The AOCS was provided by [[Matra Marconi Space]] of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-engineering-aocs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/31314-engineering/?fbodylongid=802 |title=XMM-Newton: Engineering: Attitude and Orbital Control Systems (AOCS) |publisher=European Space Agency |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-manual-362"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/uhb/aocs.html |title=Attitude &amp; Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS) |work=XMM-Newton Users' Handbook |publisher=European Space Agency |page=3.6.2 |id=Issue 2.13 |date=20 July 2015 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coarse spacecraft orientation and orbit maintenance is provided by two sets of four {{convert|20|N|adj=on|lk=on}} [[hydrazine]] thrusters (primary and backup).&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt; The hydrazine thrusters were built by [[DASA|DASA-RI]] of Germany.&lt;ref name="esa19991217"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/13180-jets-in-space-xmm-unique-pictures/ |title=Jets in space: XMM unique pictures |publisher=European Space Agency |date=17 December 1999 |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power systems ===
Primary power for ''XMM-Newton'' is provided by two fixed solar arrays. The arrays are composed of six panels measuring {{convert|1.81|xx|1.94|m|ft|abbr=on}} for a total of {{convert|21|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and a mass of {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. At launch, the arrays provided 2,200 W of power, and were expected to provide 1,600 W after ten years of operation. Deployment of each array took four minutes. The arrays were provided by [[Fokker Space]] of the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa19990818"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/xmm-newton/13035-xmm-spreads-its-wings-for-the-last-time-on-earth/ |title=XMM spreads its wings for the last time on Earth |publisher=European Space Agency |date=18 August 1999 |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When direct sunlight is unavailable, power is provided by two [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium batteries]] providing 24 [[A·h]] and weighing {{convert|41|kg|lb|abbr=on}} each. The batteries were provided by [[Saft Groupe S.A.|SAFT]] of France.&lt;ref name="Wilson2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="esa19990818"/&gt;

=== Radiation Monitor System{{anchor|ERMS}} ===
The cameras are accompanied by the ''EPIC Radiation Monitor System'' (ERMS), which measures the radiation environment surrounding the spacecraft; specifically, the ambient proton and electron flux. This provides warning of damaging radiation events to allow for automatic shut-down of the sensitive camera CCDs and associated electronics. The ERMS was built by the [[Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements]] of France.&lt;ref name="aeat2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="xmm-instruments-epic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner2001" /&gt;

=== Visual Monitoring Cameras{{anchor|VMC}} ===
The ''Visual Monitoring Cameras'' (VMC) on the spacecraft were added to monitor the deployment of solar arrays and the sun shield, and have additionally provided images of the thrusters firing and outgassing of the Telescope Tube during early operations. Two VMCs were installed on the Focal Plane Assembly looking forward. The first is FUGA-15, a black and white camera with high [[dynamic range]] and 290×290 pixel resolution. The second is IRIS-1, a colour camera with a variable [[exposure time]] and 400×310 pixel resolution. Both cameras measure {{convert|6|xx|6|xx|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weight {{convert|430|g|abbr=on}}. They use [[active pixel sensor]]s, a technology that was new at the time of ''XMM-Newton''{{'s}} development. The cameras were developed by {{abbr|OIC–Delft|Optronic Instruments and Products–Delft Sensor Systems}} and [[IMEC]], both of Belgium.&lt;ref name="esa19991217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Habinc2000"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://microelectronics.esa.int/vhdl/doc/MonCam.pdf |title=In-flight Results Using Visual Monitoring Cameras |conference=Data Systems in Aerospace. 22–26 May 2000.

== Ground systems ==
''XMM-Newton'' mission control is located at the [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) in [[Darmstadt]], Germany. Two [[ground station]]s, located in [[Perth]] and [[Kourou]], are used to maintain continuous contact with the spacecraft through most of its orbit. Back-up ground stations are located in [[Villanueva de la Cañada|Villafranca del Castillo]], [[Santiago]], and [[Dongara]]. Because ''XMM-Newton'' contains no on-board data storage, science data is transmitted to these ground stations in real time.&lt;ref name="xmm-orbit-nav"/&gt;

Data is then forwarded to the [[European Space Astronomy Centre]]{{'s}} Science Operations Centre in Villafranca del Castillo, Spain, where pipeline processing has been performed since March 2012. Data is archived at the ESAC Science Data Centre,&lt;ref name="irac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-web/ |title=Welcome to the XMM-Newton Science Archive |publisher=European Space Agency |date=6 August 2018 |accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed to mirror archives at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and the XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre (SSC) at the [[L'Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie]]. Prior to June 2013, the SSC was operated by the [[University of Leicester]], but operations were transferred due to a withdrawal of funding by the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="SSC-Leicester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSC-IRAP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xmmssc.irap.omp.eu/ |title=XMM-Newton Survey Science Centre |publisher=L'Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie |accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observations and discoveries ==
The space observatory was used to discover the [[galaxy cluster]] [[XMMXCS 2215-1738]], 10 billion light years away from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressrelease/media/media558.html |title=Massive galaxy cluster found 10 billion light years away |publisher=University of Sussex |first=Jacqui |last=Bealing |date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The object [[SCP 06F6]], discovered by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) in February 2006, was observed by ''XMM-Newton'' in early August 2006 and appeared to show an X-ray glow around it&lt;ref name="nature20080919"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080919/full/news.2008.1122.html |title=How they wonder what you are |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |first=Geoff |last=Brumfiel |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2016 |doi=10.1038/news.2008.1122}}&lt;/ref&gt; two orders of magnitude more luminous than that of [[supernova]]e.&lt;ref name="Gansicke2009"&gt;{{cite journal |title=SCP 06F6: A Carbon-rich Extragalactic Transient at Redshift ''Z'' ≃ 0.14? |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |first1=Boris T. |last1=Gänsicke |first2=Andrew J. |last2=Levan |first3=Thomas R. |last3=Marsh |first4=Peter J. |last4=Wheatley |volume=697 |issue=2 |pages=L129-L132 |date=June 2009 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/697/2/L129 |bibcode=2009ApJ...697L.129G |arxiv=0809.2562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a team from the [[University of Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], reported ''XMM-Newton'' seeing a flare that lasted four hours at a peak intensity of 10,000 times the normal rate, from an observation of [[Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient]] [[IGR J18410-0535]], where a [[blue supergiant]] star shed a plume of matter that was partly ingested by a smaller companion [[neutron star]] with accompanying X-ray emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Neutron_star_bites_off_more_than_it_can_chew |title=Neutron star bites off more than it can chew |publisher=European Space Agency |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozzo2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=XMM-Newton observations of IGR J18410-0535: the ingestion of a clump by a supergiant fast X-ray transient |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |first1=E. |last1=Bozzo |first2=A. |last2=Giunta |first3=G. |last3=Cusumano |first4=C. |last4=Ferrigno |first5=R. |last5=Walter |first6=S. |last6=Campana |first7=M. |last7=Falanga |first8=G. |last8=Israel |first9=L. |last9=Stella |display-authors=5 |volume=531 |at=A130 |date=July 2011 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201116726 |bibcode=2011A&amp;A...531A.130B |arxiv=1106.5125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 it was announced that ''XMM-Newton'' along with [[NuSTAR]] have for the first time measured the spin rate of a [[supermassive black hole]], by observing the black hole at the core of galaxy [[NGC 1365]]. At the same time, it verified the model that explains the distortion of X-rays emitted from a black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/feb/HQ_13-063_NuSTAR_Black_Hole_Spin.html |title=NASA's NuSTAR Helps Solve Riddle of Black Hole Spin |publisher=NASA |first1=J.D. |last1=Harrington |first2=Whitney |last2=Clavin |date=27 February 2013 |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Risaliti2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=A rapidly spinning supermassive black hole at the centre of NGC 1365 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |first1=G. |last1=Risaliti |first2=F.
