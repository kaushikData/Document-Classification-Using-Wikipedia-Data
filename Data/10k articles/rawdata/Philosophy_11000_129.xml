      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1327">'''Adaptive representation''' is an extension by [[Francis Heylighen]]&lt;ref&gt;Heylighen, Francis (1990). ''Representation and Change: A Metarepresentational Framework for the Foundations of Physical and Cognitive Science''. Communication and Cognition, Ghent, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]].

According to Kant, [[perception]] passes by the filters of the mind who observes the phenomena. In this line, there exists in the human mind invariant and ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' principles of experience. As an example, one may have imprinted in the brain a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian]] representation of space, a notion of time, color separation and others. This may be called "static representation".

Heylighen has proposed a revision of these Kantian ideas, in which these principles are not supposed to be invariant and necessary [[A priori and ''a priori''; instead alternative principles exist for the organization of experience in adaptive representations. This opens a path for new investigations in the [[philosophy of mind]] and human [[cognition]].

''Adiyogi'' was inaugurated on 24 February 2017 by the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Narendra Modi]], on the occasion of [[Maha Shivaratri]]{{dash}}a [[List of Hindu festivals|Hindu festival]] celebrated annually in honour of Shiva.

== Description ==
{{quote box|width=19em|border=1px|bgcolor=#FFEFD5|quote="This face is not a deity or temple, this is an iconic inspiration. In pursuit of the divine, you don't have to look up because it is not somewhere else. Each of the 112 possibilities is a method to experience the divine within you. You just have to pick one. [...] The idea is not to build one more monument but to use it as a galvanizing force towards self-transformation."|author=Sadhguru on the purpose of the statue.&lt;ref name="IE1"/&gt;}}

''Adiyogi'' is located at the Isha Yoga complex which houses the [[Dhyanalinga]] in [[Coimbatore]], Tamil Nadu at the foothills of [[Velliangiri Mountains]], a range in the [[Western Ghats]].&lt;ref name="DC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/240217/coimbatore-narendra-modi-unveils-112-feet-shiva-statue-on-mahashivaratri.html|title=Coimbatore: Narendra Modi unveils 112-feet Shiva statue on Mahashivaratri|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=24 February 2017|accessdate= 27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was designed over two years and manufactured within eight months. The bust is cast in steel. The height of the statue, {{cvt|112|ft|m}}, symbolizes the 112 possibilities to attain to ''[[moksha]]'' (liberation) that are mentioned in yogic culture. Sadhguru also said that the height represents the 112 [[chakras]] in the human system.&lt;ref name="IE1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt;

The Isha Foundation plans to erect such statues in three more locations in the eastern, western and northern parts of India - in [[Varanasi]], [[Mumbai]] and [[Delhi]].&lt;ref name="IE1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/isha-foundation-narendra-modi-112-feet-shiva-idols-in-india-4536763/ |title=PM Narendra Modi to unveil first 112 feet Shiva idol at Isha Foundation|newspaper=The Indian Express|location=Chennai|date=24 February 2017|accessdate= 27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue's face is world's tallest bust of Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/coimbatore-pm-modi-unveils-112-feet-tall-bust-of-adiyogi-shiva-117022400886_1.html|title=PM Modi unveils 112-foot tall bust of Adiyogi Shiva in Coimbatore|newspaper=Business Standard|date=24 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017|location=Coimbatore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaumudi.com/innerpage1.php?newsid=88366|title=PM unveils Adi Yogi, world's tallest bust|publisher=kaumudi|date=24 February 2017|accessdate=1 March 2017|location=Coimbatore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest Shiva statue is the [[Kailashnath Mahadev Statue]] in [[Nepal]] 20-km east of the capital, [[Katmandu]], which is {{Convert|143|ft|order=flip}} tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/south-asia/nepal-president-to-inaugurate-worlds-tallest-shiva-statue_633492.html |title= Nepal President to inaugurate `world`s tallest` Shiva statue |work=Zee News |date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Linga]] called "Yogeshwar Linga" was consecrated through the ceremony called [[Prana Pratishtha|prana pratishtha]], and is placed in front of the ''Adiyogi'' statue. This linga has five [[chakra]]s{{dash}}[[Muladhara]] (root chakra), [[Svadhishthana]] (sacral chakra), [[Manipura]] (solar plexus chakra), [[Vishuddhi]] (throat chakra), and [[Ajna]] (third eye chakra), and each one of them has sixteen dimensions.

== Inauguration ==
In 2014, on [[Guru Poornima]], a {{Convert|21|ft|adj=on|order=flip}} version of the same statue was unveiled at the Isha Yoga Center. This version weighed 30 tonnes and was constructed in three months by a team of fifteen people. This statue was also made of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2014/jul/13/Adi-Yogi-Statue-Unveiled-at-Isha-Centre-635177.html|title=Adiyogi Statue Unveiled at Isha Centre|date=13 July 2014|newspaper=New Indian Express|accessdate=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 January 2017, a replica model of the statue was taken out in a procession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/Adiyogi-replica-taken-out-on-procession/article17117933.ece|title= Adiyogi replica taken out on procession|newspaper=The Hindu|date=30 January 2017|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The main statue was inaugurated by Narendra Modi on Maha Shivaratri, 24 February 2017. He also inaugurated the book ''Adiyogi: The Source of Yoga'' written by Sadhguru and Arundhathi Subramaniam, and lit the [[Yajna|yajna fire]] for the Maha Yoga Yagna. Notable politicians  present at the event include Tamil Nadu Governor [[C. Vidyasagar Rao]], Tamil Nadu Chief Minister [[Edappadi K. Palaniswami]], Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]], Rajasthan Chief Minister [[Vasundhara Raje|Vasundhara Raje Scindia]], Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]], Minister [[Pon Radhakrishnan]], and Puducherry Lieutenant Governor [[Kiran Bedi]]. Along with politicians, various celebrities from [[Bollywood]] as well as [[Kollywood]] like actresses [[Juhi Chawla]] and [[Kajal Aggarwal]] were also present.&lt;ref name="DC1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/coimbatore/politicos-celebrities-flock-to-coimbatore/articleshow/57323833.cms|title=Politicos, celebrities flock to Coimbatore|newspaper=The Times of India|date=24 February 2017|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To mark the unveiling of the statue, the song "Adiyogi - The source of Yoga" was released by the Isha Foundation on [[YouTube]] on 19 February 2017.

Various environmental activists and groups protested the inauguration claiming that the statue was built in the catchment area of the [[Noyyal River]], thus affecting biodiversity and violating building bylaws.

'''Antonio''' "'''Toni'''" '''Negri''' (born 1 August 1933) is an Italian [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] [[sociologist]] and [[political philosophy|political philosopher]], best known for his co-authorship of ''[[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|Empire]]'' and secondarily for his work on [[Spinoza]].

Born in [[Padua]], he became a political philosophy professor in his hometown university. Negri founded the ''[[Potere Operaio]]'' (Worker Power) group in 1969 and was a leading member of  ''[[Autonomia Operaia]]''. As one of the most popular theorists of [[Autonomism]], he has published hugely influential books urging "revolutionary consciousness."

He was accused in the late 1970s of various charges including being the mastermind of the left-wing [[urban guerrilla|terrorist]] organization&lt;ref name="portelli"/&gt; [[Red Brigades]] (''Brigate Rosse'' or BR), involved in the May 1978 kidnapping of [[Aldo Moro]], two-time Prime Minister of Italy, and leader of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy, historical)|Christian-Democrat Party]], among others. He was wrongly suspected to have made a threatening phone call on behalf of the BR,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1988/10/05/ultima-parola-sul-caso-aprile.html|title=L' ULTIMA PAROLA SUL CASO '7 APRILE' LA CASSAZIONE CONFERMA LE CONDANN - la Repubblica.it|newspaper=Archivio - la Repubblica.it|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZAuGb9ZNjEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA242&amp;dq=toni+negri+phone+call+moro&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs-9PEk6fRAhXGvxQKHSVpBSEQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=toni%20negri%20phone%20call%20moro&amp;f=false|title=Death of Luigi Trastulli and Other Stories, The: Form and Meaning in Oral History|last=Portelli|first=Alessandro|date=2010-03-30|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438416335|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the court was unable to conclusively prove his ties.&lt;ref name="portelli"/&gt; The question of Negri's complicity with left-wing extremism is a controversial subject.&lt;ref name=drake&gt;Drake, Richard.

Quote: "The debate over Toni Negri's complicity in left-wing extremism has already resulted in the publication of several thick polemical volumes, as well as a huge number of op-ed pieces."&lt;/ref&gt; He was indicted on a number of charges, including "association and insurrection against the state" (a charge which was later dropped), and sentenced for involvement in two murders.

Negri fled to France where, protected by the [[Mitterrand doctrine]], he taught at the [[Paris 8 University|Paris VIII (Vincennes)]] and the [[Collège international de philosophie]], along with [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].

Many of his most influential books were published while he was behind bars. He now lives in Venice and Paris with his partner, the French philosopher [[Judith Revel]].

==Early years==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2011}}
Antonio Negri was born in [[Padua]], in the [[Northeast Italy|Northeastern Italian region]] of [[Veneto]], in 1933. His father was an active [[Communism|communist militant]] from the city of [[Bologna]] (in the [[Northeast Italy|Northeastern Italian region]] of [[Emilia-Romagna]]), and although he died when Negri was two years old, his political engagement made Negri familiar with [[Marxism]] from an early age, while his mother was a teacher from the town of [[Poggio Rusco]] (in [[province of Mantua]], [[Lombardy]])&lt;ref name=alqua2&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He began his career as a militant in the 1950s with the activist Roman Catholic youth organization ''Gioventú Italiana di Azione Cattolica (GIAC).'' Negri became a [[communism|communist]] in 1953–54 when he worked at a [[kibbutz]] in Israel for a year. The kibbutz was organised according to ideas of [[zionism|Zionist]] socialism and all the members were Jewish communists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ganahl|first=Rainer|url=http://semiotexte.com/?p=660|title=Marx is still Marx: Antonio Negri|work=Semiotext(e)|accessdate=2013-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030001958/http://semiotexte.com/?p=660|archive-date=30 October 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Italian Socialist Party]] in 1956 and remained a member until 1963, while at the same time becoming more and more engaged throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in Marxist movements.

He had a quick academic career at the [[University of Padua]] and was promoted to full professor at a young age in the field of "''dottrina dello Stato''" (State theory), a peculiarly Italian field that deals with juridical and constitutional theory. This might have been facilitated by his connections to influential politicians such as [[Raniero Panzieri]] and philosopher [[Norberto Bobbio]], strongly engaged with the Socialist Party.

In the early 1960s Negri joined the editorial group of ''Quaderni Rossi'', a journal that represented the intellectual rebirth of Marxism in Italy outside the realm of the communist party.

In 1969, together with [[Oreste Scalzone]] and [[Franco Piperno]], Negri was one of the founders of the group [[Potere Operaio]] (Workers' Power) and the ''[[Operaismo]]'' ([[workerist]]) Communist movement. ''Potere Operaio'' disbanded in 1973 and gave rise to the [[Autonomia]] Operaia Organizzata (Organised Workers' Autonomy) movement.

==Arrest and flight==
On 16 March 1978, [[Aldo Moro]], former Italian prime minister and Christian Democrat party leader, was kidnapped in Rome by the [[Red Brigades]], his five-man body guard murdered on the spot of the kidnapping in Rome's Via Fani. While they were holding him, forty-five days after the kidnapping,&lt;ref name=windschuttle/&gt; the Red Brigades called his family on the phone, informing Moro's wife of her husband's impending death.&lt;ref name=windschuttle/&gt; Nine days later his body, shot in the head, was found dumped in a city lane.&lt;ref name=windschuttle/&gt; The conversation was recorded, and later broadcast and televised. A number of people who knew Negri and remembered his voice identified him as the probable author of the call, but the claim has been since dismissed: the author of the call was, in fact, [[Valerio Morucci]].&lt;ref name="telefonobluff"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tecniche d'indagine.

On 7 April 1979, at the age of forty-six, Antonio Negri was arrested for his part in the Autonomy Movement, along with others (Emilio Vesce, Luciano Ferrari Bravo, Mario Dalmaviva, Lauso Zagato, [[Oreste Scalzone]], Pino Nicotri, Alisa del Re, Carmela di Rocco, Massimo Tramonte, Sandro Serafini, Guido Bianchini, and others). Padova's Public Prosecutor Pietro Calogero accused them of being  involved in the political wing of the Red Brigades, and thus behind [[left-wing terrorism]] in Italy. Negri was charged with a number of offenses, including leadership of the [[Red Brigades]], masterminding the 1978 kidnapping and murder of the President of the Christian Democratic Party [[Aldo Moro]], and plotting to overthrow the government.&lt;ref name="bull"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/malcolm-bull/you-cant-build-a-new-society-with-a-stanley-knife |title=You can’t build a new society with a Stanley knife |author=Malcolm Bull |publisher=London Review of Books |language= |date=4 October 2001 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113214455/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/malcolm-bull/you-cant-build-a-new-society-with-a-stanley-knife |archive-date=13 January 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Negri was a political science professor at the University of Padua and visiting lecturer at Paris' [[École Normale Supérieure]]. The Italian public was shocked that an academic could be involved in such events.&lt;ref name=windschuttle/&gt;

A year later, Negri was exonerated from Aldo Moro's kidnapping after a leader of the BR, having decided to cooperate with the prosecution, testified that Negri "had nothing to do with the Red Brigades."&lt;ref name="portelli"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/hwj/20.1.5|title=Oral Testimony, the Law and the Making of History: the 'April 7' Murder Trial|last=Portelli|first=Alessandro|journal=History Workshop Journal|volume=20 |issue=1 |pages= 5–35|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge of 'armed insurrection against the State' against Negri was dropped at the last moment, and because of this he did not receive the 30-year plus life sentence requested by the prosecutor, but only 30 years for being the instigator of political activist Carlo Saronio's murder and having 'morally concurred' with the murder of Andrea Lombardini, a [[carabinier]], during a failed bank robbery.&lt;ref name="portelli" /&gt;
{{Libertarian socialism |People}}
His philosopher peers saw little fault with Negri's activities. [[Michel Foucault]] commented, "Isn't he in jail simply for being an intellectual?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Foucault]], "Le philosophe masqué" (in ''Dits et écrits'', volume 4, Paris, Gallimard, 1994, p. 105)&lt;/ref&gt; French philosophers [[Félix Guattari]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]] also signed in November 1977 ''L'Appel des intellectuels français contre la répression en Italie'' (The Call of French Intellectuals Against Repression in Italy) in protest against Negri's imprisonment and Italian [[anti-terrorism legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibliothequedusaulchoir.org/activites/Deleuze/Deleuze+Bibliogr.pdf |title=Revised bibliography of Deleuze |accessdate=30 August 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030174653/http://www.bibliothequedusaulchoir.org/activites/Deleuze/Deleuze%20Bibliogr.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]], ''Lettre ouverte aux juges de Negri'', text n°20 in ''Deux régimes de fous'', [[Mille et une nuits]], 2003 (transl. of ''Lettera aperta ai giudici di Negri'' published in ''[[La Repubblica]]'' on 10 May 1979); ''Ce livre est littéralement une preuve d'innocence'', text n°21 (op.cit.), originally published in ''[[Le Matin de Paris]]'' on 13 December 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, four years after his arrest and while he was still in prison awaiting trial, Negri was elected to the Italian legislature as a member for the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]].&lt;ref name="pannella"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/giugno/22/Pannella_chiaro_che_mira_all_co_0_97062213413.shtml |title=Pannella: e' chiaro che mira all' amnistia |date=22 June 1997 |work=[[Corriere della Sera]] |accessdate=5 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904191348/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1997/giugno/22/Pannella_chiaro_che_mira_all_co_0_97062213413.shtml |archive-date=4 September 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming parliamentary immunity, he was temporarily released and used his freedom to escape to France. There he remained for 14 years, writing and teaching, protected from extradition in virtue of the "[[Mitterrand doctrine]]". His refusal to stand trial in Italy was widely criticized by Italian media and by the Italian Radical Party, who had supported his candidacy to Parliament.&lt;ref name="pannella"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2011}}

In France, Negri began teaching at the [[Paris 8 University|Paris VIII (Vincennes)]] and the [[Collège international de philosophie]], founded by [[Jacques Derrida]]. Although the conditions of his residence in France prevented him from engaging in political activities, he wrote prolifically and was active in a broad coalition of left-wing intellectuals. In 1990 Negri with Jean-Marie Vincent and Denis Berger founded the journal ''Futur Antérieur''. (The journal ceased publication in 1998 but was reborn as ''[[Multitudes]]'' in 2000, with Negri as a member of the international editorial board.)

In 1997, after a plea-bargain that reduced his prison time from 30 to 13 years,&lt;ref name=windschuttle/&gt; Negri returned to Italy to serve the end of his sentence. He was released from prison in the spring of 2003, having written some of his most influential works while behind bars.

In the late 1980s the Italian President [[Francesco Cossiga]] described Antonio Negri as "a psychopath" who "poisoned the minds of an entire generation of Italy's youth."&lt;ref&gt;The Independent, "[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/antonio-negri-the-nostalgic-revolutionary-556885.html Antonio Negri: The nostalgic revolutionary] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028193646/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/antonio-negri-the-nostalgic-revolutionary-556885.html |date=28 October 2011 }}", 17 August 2004.

== Political thought and writing ==
{{Left communism sidebar}}
Unlike other forms of [[Marxism]], autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the [[working class]] to force changes to the organization of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system independent of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[trade unions]] or [[political parties]]. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than are other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a "bottom-up" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working-class resistance to capitalism, for example [[absenteeism]], slow working, and socialization in the workplace. The journal ''Quaderni Rossi'' ("Red Notebooks"), produced between 1961 and 1965, and its successor ''Classe Operaia'' ("Working Class"), produced between 1963 and 1966, were also influential in the development of early autonomism. Both were founded by Antonio Negri and [[Mario Tronti]].

Today, Antonio Negri is best known as the co-author, with [[Michael Hardt]], of the controversial Marxist-inspired treatise ''[[Empire (Negri and Hardt book)|Empire]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name="bull"/&gt;

In 2009 Negri completed the book ''Commonwealth'', the final in a trilogy that began in 2000 with ''Empire'' and continued with ''Multitude'' in 2004, co-authored with Michael Hardt.&lt;ref name="gray"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/commonwealth-by-michael-hardt-amp--antonio-negribrfirst-as-tragedy-then-as-farce-by-slavoj-zizek-1823817.html |title=Commonwealth, By Michael Hardt &amp; Antonio Negri / First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, By Slavoj Zizek |author=Gray, John |publisher=[[The Independent]] |language= |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144240/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/commonwealth-by-michael-hardt-amp--antonio-negribrfirst-as-tragedy-then-as-farce-by-slavoj-zizek-1823817.html |archive-date=14 November 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Labor of Dionysus: A Critique of the State-Form'' (1994)===
In this book the authors ask themselves "How is it, then, that labor, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society?" The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labor in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/labor-of-dionysus Introductory page on the book by University of Minnesota press]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Insurgencies: Constituent Power and the Modern State'' (1999) ===
This book written solely by Negri "explores the drama of modern revolutions-from Machiavelli’s Florence and Harrington’s England to the American, French, and Russian revolutions-and puts forward a new notion of how power and action must be understood if we are to achieve a radically democratic future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/insurgencies Introduction to the book by University of Minnesota Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Empire'' (2000) ===
{{main|Empire (Negri and Hardt book)}}
In general, the book theorizes an ongoing transition from a "modern" phenomenon of [[imperialism]], centered around individual [[nation-states]], to an emergent [[postmodern]] construct created among ruling powers which the authors call "Empire", with different forms of warfare:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...according to Hardt and Negri's ''Empire'', the rise of Empire is the end of national conflict, the "enemy" now, whoever he is, can no longer be ideological or national. The enemy now must be understood as a kind of criminal, as someone who represents a threat not to a political system or a nation but to the law. This is the enemy as a terrorist....In the "new order that envelops the entire space of... civilization", where conflict between nations has been made irrelevant, the "enemy" is simultaneously "banalized" (reduced to an object of routine police repression) and absolutized (as the Enemy, an absolute threat to the ethical order"&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, ''Empire'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts &amp; London, England: Harvard University Press, 2000), pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pg 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Empire'' elaborates a variety of ideas surrounding constitutions, global war, and class. Hence, the Empire is constituted by a [[monarchy]] (the [[United States]] and the [[G8]], and [[international organizations]] such as [[NATO]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] or the [[World Trade Organization]]), an [[oligarchy]] (the [[multinational corporations]] and other nation-states) and a democracy (the various [[non-government organization]]s and the [[United Nations]]). Part of the book's analysis deals with "imagin&lt;nowiki&gt;[ing]&lt;/nowiki&gt; resistance", but "the point of Empire is that it, too, is "total" and that resistance to it can only take the form of negation - "the will to be against".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pg 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire is total, but [[economic inequality]] persists, and as all identities are wiped out and replaced with a universal one, the identity of the poor persists.&lt;ref&gt;"The problem, as they see it, is that "postmodernist authors" have neglected the one identity that should matter most to those on the left, the one we have always with us: "The only non-localizable 'common name' of pure difference in all eras is that of the poor" (156)...only the poor, Hardt and Negri say, "live radically the actual and present being" (157)." Walter Benn Michaels, ''The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to the end of history'' (Princeton University Press, 2004), pg 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire'' (2004)===
{{main|Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire}}
''Multitude'' addresses these issues and picks up the thread where ''Empire'' has left off. In order to do so, Hardt and Negri argue, one must first analyze the present configuration of war and its contradictions. This analysis is performed in the first chapter, after which chapters two and three focus on multitude and democracy, respectively. ''Multitude'' is not so much a sequel as it is a reiteration from a new point of view in a new, relatively accessible style that is distinct from the predominantly [[Academia|academic]] prose style of ''Empire''. Multitude remains, the authors insist, despite its ubiquitous subject matter and its almost casual tone, a book of philosophy which aims to shape a conceptual ground for a political process of democratization rather than present an answer to the question ‘what to do?’ or offer a programme for concrete action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Love's Lessons: Intimacy, Pedagogy and Political Community| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities | volume= 22 | issue= 4 | pages= 69-79 | year= 2017 | url = https://www.academia.edu/35349930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Commonwealth'' (2009)===
{{main|Commonwealth (book)}}
[[File:Antonio Negri y Michael Hardt.jpg|thumbnail|right|Antonio Negri  holding a copy of ''[[Commonwealth (book)|Commonwealth]]'', with co-author [[Michael Hardt]]]]
In this book, the authors introduce the concept of "the republic of property": "What is central for our purposes here is that the concept of property and the defense of property remain the foundation of every modern political constitution. This is the sense in which the republic, from the great bourgeois revolutions to today, is a republic of property".&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.15&lt;/ref&gt; Part 2 of the book deals with the relationship between modernity and anti-modernity and proposes "[[altermodernity]]". Altermodernity "involves not only insertion in the long history of antimodern struggles but also rupture with any fixed dialectic between modern sovereignty and antimodern resistance. In the passage from antimodernity to altermodernity, just as tradition and identity are transformed, so too resistance takes on a new meaning, dedicated now to the constitution of alternatives. The freedom that forms the base of resistance, as we explained earlier, comes to the fore and constitutes an event to announce a new political project."&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt. ''Commonwealth''. Harvard University Press. 2009. Pg.107&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Alex Callinicos]] in a review "What is newest in ''Commonwealth'' is its take on the fashionable idea of the common. Hardt and Negri mean by this not merely the natural resources that capital seeks to appropriate, but also "the languages we create, the social practices we establish, the modes of sociality that define our relationships", which are both the means and the result of biopolitical production. Communism, they argue, is defined by the common, just as capitalism is by the private and socialism (which they identify in effect with statism) with the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11189 |title=Commonwealth. Book Review by Alex Callinicos, March 2010 |access-date=21 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703061220/http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11189 |archive-date=3 July 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] Negri and Hardt "in the search of an altermodernity — something that is outside the dialectical opposition between modernity and anti-modernity — they need a means of escape. The choice between capitalism and socialism, they suggest, is all wrong. We need to identify something entirely different, communism — working within a different set of dimensions."&lt;ref name="korotonomedya1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.korotonomedya.net/kor/index.php?id=27,316,0,0,1,0 |title=David Harvey, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt.

As such, they state that "We instead define the concept of [[Mathematical singularity|singularity]], contrasting it to the figure of the individual on the one hand and forms of identity on the other, by focusing on three aspects of its relationship to multiplicity: Singularity refers externally to a multiplicity of others; is internally divided or multiple; and constitutes a multiplicity over time - that is, a process of becoming."&lt;ref name="korotonomedya1"/&gt;

=== Occupy movements of 2011–2012 and ''Declaration'' ===
In May 2012 Negri self-published (with Michael Hardt) an electronic pamphlet on the [[Occupy movement|occupy and encampment movements of 2011–2012]] called ''[[Declaration (book)|Declaration]]'' that argues the movement explores new forms of democracy. The introduction was published at ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' under the title "Take Up the Baton". He also published an article with Hardt in ''Foreign Affairs'' in October 2011 stating "The Encampment in Lower Manhattan Speaks to a Failure of Representation."&lt;ref name="Foreign" /&gt;

'''Archibald "Archie" Cox Jr.''' (May 17, 1912 – May 29, 2004) was an American lawyer and [[law professor]] who served as [[United States Solicitor General|U.S. Solicitor General]] under President [[John F. Kennedy]] and later as a [[special prosecutor]] during the [[Watergate scandal]]. During his career, he was a pioneering expert on [[labor law]] and also an authority on [[constitutional law]]. ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' has identified Cox as one of the most cited legal scholars of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Fred R.|year=2000|title=The Most-Cited Legal Scholars|journal=Journal of Legal Studies|volume=29|issue=1|pages=409–426|doi=10.1086/468080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox was Senator [[John F. Kennedy]]'s labor advisor and in 1961, President Kennedy appointed him solicitor general, an office he held for four and a half years. Cox became famous when under mounting pressure and charges of corruption against persons closely associated with [[Richard Nixon]], Attorney General nominee [[Elliot Richardson]] appointed him as [[Special Prosecutor]] to oversee the federal criminal investigation into the Watergate burglary and other related crimes that became popularly known as the [[Watergate scandal]]. He had a dramatic confrontation with Nixon when he subpoenaed [[Nixon White House tapes|the tapes the president had secretly recorded]] of his Oval Office conversations. When Cox refused a direct order from the White House to seek no further tapes or presidential materials, Nixon fired him in an incident that became known as the [[Saturday Night Massacre]]. Cox's firing produced a public relations disaster for Nixon and set in motion impeachment proceedings which ended with Nixon stepping down from the presidency.

Cox returned to teaching, lecturing, and writing for the rest of his life, giving his opinions on the role of the Supreme Court in the development of the law and the role of the lawyer in society. Although he was recommended to President [[Jimmy Carter]] for a seat on the First Circuit Court of Appeals, his nomination fell victim to the dispute between the president and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]. He was appointed to head several public-service, watchdog and good-government organizations, including serving for 12 years as head of [[Common Cause]]. He was elected to the [[Common Cause]] National Governing Board in 1976 and 1997. In addition he argued two important Supreme Court cases, winning both: one concerning the constitutionality of federal campaign finance restrictions (''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'') and the other the leading early case testing affirmative action (''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]'').

==Early life, education and private practice==

===Family and ancestors===
Cox was born in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], the son of Archibald and Frances "Fanny" Bruen Perkins Cox, the eldest of seven children.{{efn|Cox's siblings were: Elizabeth "Betty" (born 1913), Mary "Molly" (1916), Robert (1919), Maxwell (1922), Louis (1924) and Rowland (1928).{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=8}}}} His father Archibald Sr. (Harvard College, 1896; Harvard Law School, 1899&lt;ref name="FathObit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/03/01/archives/obituary-4-no-title.html|title=Archibald Cox: New York Lawyer dies at Age of 56 in Home at Rahway, N.J.|work=New York Times|date=February 28, 1931|page=30|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the son of a Manhattan lawyer, Rowland Cox, and rose to prominence as a patent and trademark lawyer, and who wrote ''Cox's Manual on Trade Marks''.{{efn|''See'' {{harvnb|Gormley|1999|p=4}}. The volume edited by Cox's grandfather was: {{cite book|last=Cox|first=Rowland|title=American Trade Mark Cases: A Compilation of All the Reported Trade Mark Cases Decided in the American Courts prior to the year 1871. With an Appendix Containing the Leading English Cases …|location=Cincinnati|publisher=R. Clarke|year=1871}}}} When Rowland Cox died suddenly in 1900, Archibald Sr. inherited his father's solo practice almost right out of law school. He built on that start to become successful in his own right.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/30/nyregion/archibald-cox-92-is-dead-helped-prosecute-watergate.html|title=Archibald Cox, 92, Is Dead; Helped Prosecute Watergate|work=New York Times|date=May 30, 2004|page=N32|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most prominent achievement was securing the red cross as the trademark of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=4}} Compared to the lawyers on his mother's side, his father (as Archibald Jr. reflected late in his life) did not participate much in public service, although he had "done a few things for [[Woodrow Wilson]] … at the time of the peace conference" and was president of the local Board of Education.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|p=1:22}} He also served as a member of the New Jersey Rapid Transit Commission.&lt;ref name="FathObit"/&gt;

===Education===
[[File:Sheldon Lib SPS.JPG|left|thumbnail|The library at St. Paul's School in New Hampshire]]Cox attended the private [[Wardlaw-Hartridge School|Wardlaw School]] in Edison, New Jersey until he was fourteen.{{sfn|Hilbinks|2000|pp=1–2}} Afterwards, he studied at [[St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in New Hampshire, attending due to his father's intervention on his behalf despite low grades.&lt;ref name="CSpanInt"&gt;{{harvnb|Collins|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox thrived at St. Paul and in his final year he won Hugh Camp Memorial Cup for public speaking and led the school's debate team to defeat [[Groton School|Groton]].{{sfn|Gormley|1999|p=16}} It was during this period that he read [[Albert J. Beveridge|Beveridge]]'s ''Life of John Marshall'', which was an important early ingredient in Cox's progressive view of the law.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|pp=1:4–5}} With a warm recommendation from the head-master (and family connections), Cox was able to enter Harvard College in 1930.

====College====
At Harvard, Cox joined a [[Final Club|final club]], the [[Delphic Club]], called the "Gashouse" for its parties, gambling and liquor (during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]).{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=20–21}} He majored in History, Government and Economics and did slightly better than "gentlemanly Cs."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilbink|1999|p=1:5}}; {{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during the second semester of his freshman year that his father died, at age 56.&lt;ref name = "FathObit"/&gt; For Cox's senior thesis he proposed analyzing the constitutional differences of the composition between the Senate and House through early American history. His advisor, [[Paul Herman Buck|Paul Buck]], told him he did not "have brains enough" for the project. Cox took up the challenge and completed ''Senatorial Saucer.''{{efn|The title of the paper referred to [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]]'s explanation to the French of the function of the Senate: just as pouring tea into a saucer cools it, so legislation coming from the House ("hot" because of the populist composition of that body) is cooled in the Senate (which is less populist because they are appointed by the states rather than elected by the people). One aspect of the research that would later relate to Cox's most famous episode was the impeachment and acquittal of Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]] in 1803. Chase was the first nationally known official to be impeached by the House.{{sfn|Gormley|p=26}}}} As a result of the work Cox was able to graduate with honors in History.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|pp=1:6–7}} Cox continued on to Harvard Law School in 1934.

====Law School====
Cox thrived at law school, ranking first in his class of 593 at the end of his first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|pp=1:26–28}}; {{harvnb|Hilbink|2000|pp=9, 12–13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox's second year was taken up with work on the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. He also met his future wife Phyllis Ames. Cox proposed to her after only three or four meetings. She initially put him off, but by March 1936 they were engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1936/03/15/archives/ames-cox.html|title=Ames—Cox|work=New York Times|date=March 15, 1936|page=N7|accessdate=March 31, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phyllis, who graduated Smith the year before, was the granddaughter of [[James Barr Ames]], one time dean of Harvard Law School and noted for popularizing the [[casebook method]] of legal study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/03/19/archives/phyllis-ames-to-be-wed-to-archibald-cox-in-ceremony-on-june-12-at.html|title=Phyllis Ames to Be Wed to Archibald Cox In Ceremony on June 12 at Wayland, Mass.|work=New York Times|date=March 19, 1937|page=20|accessdate=March 10, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor (and later United States Associate Justice) [[Felix Frankfurter]] wrote them a congratulatory note on their betrothal, which exclaimed: "My God, what a powerful legal combination!"{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=33}} Cox graduated in 1937 ''magna cum laude'', one of nine receiving the highest honor awarded by the law school that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/06/24/archives/harvard-university-confers-2062-degrees-at-todays-commencement.html|title=Harvard University Confers 2,062 Degrees at Today's Commencement Exercises|work=New York Times|date=June 24, 1937|page=28|accessdate=March 12, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks before his commencement, Cox and Phyllis married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1937/06/13/archives/phyllis-ames-wed-in-floral-setting-married-in-wayland-mass-to.html|title=Phyllis Ames Wed in Floral Setting|work=New York Times|date=June 13, 1937|page=138|accessdate=March 12, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to New York City after law school, Cox served as a clerk with United States District Court Judge Learned Hand.&lt;ref name="CSpanInt" /&gt;

===Private practice and wartime service===
After a year in New York City, Cox accepted an associate position with the Boston law firm of [[Ropes, Gray, Best, Coolidge and Rugg]]. After World War II began, Cox took a position in the United States Solicitor General's office. By 1943, Cox had advanced to become Assistant Solicitor of the Labor Department.

====Solicitor in the Labor Department====
As associate solicitor Cox's job in the Labor Department was to supervise enforcement at the District Court level of federal labor statutes. Cox had a staff of eight lawyers in Washington and supervised the Department's regional offices, including deciding when a regional attorney could bring suit. Most of the litigation involved wage and hours issues under the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]]. His background in the solicitor general's office also allowed him to handle much of the appellate work.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|p=49}} By virtue of his position Cox also occasionally sat as an alternative public member of the Wage Adjustment Board, which was a specialized subsidiary of the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board]], which dealt with the construction industry and attempted to maintain labor peace by mediating non-wage disputes and setting prevailing wage rates and increases under the [[Davis–Bacon Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

===Harvard faculty and labor arbitrator===
After WWII was over, Cox returned to the law firm Ropes, Gray with the intention of spending his professional career there. Instead, he lasted five weeks.&lt;ref name="CSpanInt"/&gt; Dean [[James M. Landis|Landis]] of the Harvard Law School offered to hire Cox as a probationary teacher in the fall of 1945. Cox accepted, despite the substantial cut in salary he would take, but on the condition that he would not have to teach corporations or property. Landis agreed; his expectation was that Cox should become a nationally recognized expert in [[labor law]].{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=59–60}} In addition to [[labor law]], Cox started out teaching [[tort]]s. Later he would also teach [[unfair competition]], [[Law of agency|agency]] and [[administrative law]].{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|p=54}} He was made a permanent professor during the 1946–47 academic year, a time when the law school greatly increased enrollment in the post-war boom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hlrec1500&amp;id=235&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;terms=Archibald%20Cox&amp;termtype=phrase&amp;set_as_cursor=3828|title=Dean's Report Cites Record of Veterans|work=Harvard Law School Record|volume=5|number=12|date=January 6, 1948|page=1|accessdate=April 7, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a legal scholar and professor at Harvard throughout the 1950s, Cox became immensely influential in the labor field. His writing was so prolific that Dean [[Erwin Griswold|Griswold]] pointed to Cox when he needed an example of the kind of academic output he was seeking from the faculty.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=84}} Given that the peak of his academic career also coincided with the enactment of the statutes that defined industrial relations, his work, usually the first on any new topic, shaped the Supreme Court's thinking. His one-time student and later colleague [[Derek Bok]] described this influence:

{{Quote|text=In the 1950s, the National Labor Relations Act was still relatively new, and the Taft-Hartley Act was in its infancy. Over the decade, the Supreme Court had a series of opportunities to clarify the meaning of good faith bargaining, the scope of mandatory arbitration, the legal status of arbitration, and other important issues of policy left open by Congress. In case after case, when the majority reached the critical point of decision, the justices would rely on one of Archie's articles.{{sfn|Bok|2006|p=462}}}}

In addition to his direct effect on Supreme Court decisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/berkjemp4&amp;start_page=483&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;id=493|last=Lynd|first=Slaughton|title=Government without Rights: The Labor Law Vision of Archibald Cox|work=Industrial Relations Law Journal|volume=4|number=3|pages=483–95, 487 n. 36|date=Summer 1981|accessdate=April 10, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox's scholarly writing influenced other academics and practitioners who widely cited him. ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'' lists Cox as one of the most-cited legal scholars of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Fred R. |year=2000 |title=The Most-Cited Legal Scholars |journal=Journal of Legal Studies |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=409–26 |doi=10.1086/468080}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework he developed, first in the two articles with Dunlop in 1950-51, then elaborated on his own, became the standard view of the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts. It assumed roughly equal bargaining power between union and management and interpreted the labor laws (often contrary to the language of the statutes themselves) to limit individual employee rights unless pursued by his bargaining agent, to restrict the subjects on which management is required to bargain about based on past practices, to permit unions to waive rights the statutes otherwise gave to employees and in general to advocate the notion that labor statutes should be interpreted to promote industrial peace over enhancing the economic power of labor.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/berkjemp4&amp;collection=journals&amp;index=&amp;id=345|last=Harper|first=Michael C.|title=Union Waiver of Employee Rights under the NLRA: Part I |work=Industrial Relations Law Journal|volume=4|number=1|date=Summer 1981|pages=335–89|accessdate=April 10, 2016}} {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/berkjemp4&amp;start_page=483&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;id=493|last=Lynd|first=Slaughton|title=Government without Rights: The Labor Law Vision of Archibald Cox|work=Industrial Relations Law Journal|volume=4|number=3|pages=483–95|date=Summer 1981|accessdate=April 10, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}} {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/clr80&amp;start_page=267&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;id=283|last=Kaden|first=|title=Judges and Arbitrators: Observations on the Scope of Judicial Review|work=Columbia Law Review|volume=80|number=2|date=March 1980|pages=267–98|accessdate=April 10, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes|doi=10.2307/1121921}} {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mnlr62&amp;start_page=265&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults#&amp;id=279|last=Klare|first=Karl E.|title=Judicial Deradicalization of the Wagner Act and the Origins of Modern Legal Consciousness, 1937–1941|work=Minnesota Law Review|volume=62|number=3|date=March 1978|pages=265–340|accessdate=April 10, 2016|via=[[Heinonline]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework remained the dominant view of federal labor relations until the late 1950s when concerns over member participation began to shape policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/berkjemp20&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=&amp;id=7|last=Schiller|first=Reuel E.|title=From Group Rights to Individual Liberties: Post-War Labor Law, Liberalism, and the Waning of Union Strength|work=Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law|volume=20|number=1|year=1999|pages=1–73|accessdate=April 15, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}} {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/dlr87&amp;start_page=253&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;id=263|last=Carney|first=James T.|title=In Defense of Industrial Pluralism|work=Dickinson Law Review|volume=87|number=2|date=Winter 1983|pages=253–64|accessdate=April 10, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}} {{cite journal|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4729&amp;context=penn_law_review|title=The Radical Potential of the Wagner Act: The Duty to Bargain Collectively|work=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|volume=129|number=6|pages=1392–426|date=June 1981|accessdate=April 10, 2016|doi=10.2307/3311962}} {{cite journal|last=Tomlins|first=Christopher L.|title=The New Deal, Collective Bargaining, and the Triumph of Industrial Pluralism|work=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|volume=39|number=1|date=October 1985|pages=19–34|subscription=yes|doi=10.2307/2523535|jstor=2523535}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be Cox and his work with Senator Kennedy on the bill that became the [[Landrum–Griffin Act]] that would initiate the new framework.

==Advisor to Senator Kennedy and role in the Kennedy administration==

===Kennedy advisor, then partisan===

====Kennedy's labor expert====
In 1953 the young and ambitious [[John F. Kennedy]], new to the Senate, decided that labor relations would be the area that he would specialize in to begin building a policy and legislative resume for use in future political endeavors. He wrote to Cox in March 1953 inviting him to testify before the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=98}} Cox was a natural ally to seek out. He was one of Kennedy's constituents and a fellow Harvard alumnus. More importantly he was a nationally recognized academic expert on labor law and a liberal Democrat{{efn|Professor Cox in 2000 was not certain when he had registered as a Democrat. He thought it "may have just been in connection with working with Kennedy and thinking it would be well advised."{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|p=1:62}} He once revealed that he had voted in an election for Democrat [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] for president, Republicans [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] for Senator and [[Christian Herter]] for Governor.&lt;ref name="ProfDemand"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/04/06/archives/professor-in-demand-archibald-cox.html|title=Professor in Demand: Archibald Cox|work=New York Times|date=April 6, 1960|page=31|accessdate=April 20, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lodge's opponent in that race was John F. Kennedy.}} with a predisposition towards labor.

In the fall of 1959, after the work on the Landrum–Griffin Act had wound up, Kennedy confided to Cox that he was running for president.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=112}} In January 1960 he wrote Cox formally asking him to head up his efforts to "tap intellectual talent in the Cambridge area" and then "ride herd over twenty or thirty college professors" in their activities for him.{{efn|[[Abram Chayes]] claimed that it was his idea to select Cox for this purpose and so told Sorensen "a couple of months" before 1960.{{sfn|Chayes|1964|pp=52–53}}{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=115}} Much like he did with the informal group of advisors that Cox recruited and led for the initial advice on the McClellan Hearings, Kennedy never made explicit what activities he wanted the group to perform, although he was clear to both Cox and those experts he met that he did not expect them to consider political implications in delivering their opinion on sound policy.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|p=1:72}} Cox later found out that the position had been originally offered to Harvard law professor [[Mark De Wolfe Howe (historian)|Mark Howe]], who turned it down, thinking he was not suited for the role and recommended Cox.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hilbink|2000|pp=1:70–71}}; {{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Cox brought a number of eminent policy experts in a number of fields into contact with Kennedy. Although many were skeptical of his candidacy and some had been loyal to or inclined towards either [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] or [[Hubert Humphrey]], Kennedy won them over at a meeting in Boston's Harvard Club on January 24.{{efn|''See'' {{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=116}}. The attendees included, from MIT: [[Jerome Wiesner]], [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt W. Rostow]], [[Paul Samuelson]], [[Lucian Pye]] and [[Walter A. Rosenblith]]; from Harvard Law School: Mark Howe, [[Paul Freund]] and [[Abram Chayes]]; and from Brandeis: [[Edward L. Katzenbach, Jr.]]{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=485 n.22}}}} In the period leading up to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention|Democratic Convention]] in July Cox acted mainly as a "stimulator" to prod various academics to send memoranda to Kennedy or to find academics to supply Kennedy with policy positions on specific topics.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|pp=1:72–73}} While before the Convention Cox had not recruited extensively beyond the Boston area, he had at least one recruit from the University of Colorado and recruited from [[Stanford University|Stanford]].{{sfn|Lester|1964|p=47}} as well. Even though the number was not large before the nomination, no other Democratic contender, not even Stevenson, had made an effort to recruit intellectual partisans.{{sfn|Lester|1964|pp=42–45}}

[[File:Archibald Cox in 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Archibald Cox in April 1960]]
As with the case of Cox's informal group of labor advisors, Kennedy was anxious to use Cox's contacts not only for their expertise but also for the éclat they gave his campaign. A ''Congressional Quarterly'' article in April, widely reprinted in local papers, named Cox and the other Cambridge advisors as a key to the kinds of policies Kennedy would advocate.&lt;ref&gt;One of the many papers that reprinted the report: {{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4766714/jefferson_city_posttribune/|title=Presidential Candidates Rely on 'Brain Trusts' for Advice|work=Jefferson City [Mo.] Post-Tribune|date=April 26, 1960|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Of John F. Kennedy's political talents none has been more helpful to him than his ability to attract capable men to his cause," the ''Times'' said in the middle of the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/07/14/archives/kennedys-nomination-drive-aided-by-mixture-of-amateurs.html|title=Kennedy's Nomination Drive Aided by Mixture of Amateurs, Professionals, Eggheads and Hardheads|work=New York Times|date=July 14, 1960|accessdate=March 23, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Cox's academic advisers was designed to recall Roosevelt's "[[Brain trust#Roosevelt.27s .22Brain Trust.22|Brain Trusts]]": "More ideas poured in from Cambridge, Mass., where an astounding galaxy of scholars had made themselves and informal brain-trust for Senator Kennedy."

After the Los Angeles Convention Kennedy, now the nominee, asked Cox to move to Washington to have an expanded role, hiring speechwriters and coordinating academic talent. Cox accepted, and then Kennedy point blank asked Cox if he thought he could get along with [[Ted Sorensen]] and explained "Sorensen's fear that somebody was going to elbow his way in between him and Kennedy."{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|p=1:74}} Cox assumed he could.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=122}} Cox had been unaware that Sorensen had already been at work, back in February, trying to compartmentalize and minimize Cox's group's efforts. Sorenen told [[Joseph A. Loftus]] of the ''Times'' that the Cambridge group was "something 'much more talked about than fact.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/02/08/archives/diverse-staffs-assist-kennedy-some-work-for-candidate-others-for.html|last=Loftus|first=James A.|title=Diverse Staffs Assist Kennedy|work=New York Times|date=February 8, 1960|page=25|accessdate=March 28, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox would soon discover, however, that Sorensen always "was terribly worried about being cut out" and protected Kennedy from independent advice including Cox's.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|page=1:66}}

===Solicitor General of the United States===
[[File:Cox, Hoover, RFK.jpg|right|thumb|FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and Solicitor General Archibald Cox in Rose Garden on May 7, 1963.]]
After Kennedy's election in 1960, despite publicly downplaying the idea that he was being considered for public office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hlrec31&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=29&amp;id=168|title=Professor Cox Back at the Law School, Resumes Teaching|work=Harvard Law Record|volume=31|number=11|date=December 8, 1960|page=8|accessdate=April 15, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was concerned he might be offered a seat on the NLRB or a second echelon position in the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]. Neither position offered new challenges for him, but he worried about the propriety of refusing.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|p=1:78}} Before leaving for his family Christmas celebration in Windsor, he was tipped by [[Anthony Lewis]] of the ''Times'' that he had been chosen for Solicitor General.  Cox decided that if this was true, he would tell the president-elect that he needed time to think the matter over. But when Kennedy called, interrupting a family lunch, he accepted immediately.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=143}} Cox was unaware until much later that his law school colleague, [[Paul Freund]], whom he had recommended for the position, declined and recommended Cox in turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=141}}; {{harvnb|Hilbink|2000|pp=2:117–18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next month Cox appeared before the Senate Judicial Committee for confirmation hearings, but his reputation was such that the hearing took only ten minutes; even minority leader Dirksen, who knew Cox from Landrum–Griffin days, said he "had been quite impressed with his legal abilities … ."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=146}}; {{cite book|last=Salokar|first=Rebecca Mae|title=The Solicitor General: The Politics of Law|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1992|isbn=0877229260 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nearly century that the office had existed before Cox occupied it, the solicitor general, as the government's lawyer before the Supreme Court, was immensely influential. Cox held the position at a time when the [[Warren Court]] was about to involve the Court in issues never before considered appropriate for judicial review, at a time when the country was ready for the Court to decide various questions of social justice and individual rights. Cox was aware of the pivotal time the Court and he faced and explained it in an address right before the beginning of the first full Term he would argue in:
	
{{Quote|text=[A]n extraordinarily large proportion of the most fundamental issues of our times ultimately go before the Supreme Court for judicial determination. They are the issues upon which the community, consciously or unconsciously, is most deeply divided. They arouse the deepest emotions. Their resolution—one way or the other often writes our future history. … Perhaps it is an exaggeration to suggest that in the United States we have developed an extraordinary facility for casting social, economic, philosophical and political questions in the form of actions at law and suits in equity, and then turning around and having the courts decide them upon social, economic, and philosophical grounds. It is plainly true that we put upon the Supreme Court the burden of deciding cases that would never come before the judicial branch in any other country.{{sfn|Cox|1961|p=94}}}}

====Civil rights and sit-in cases====
During the customary introduction of the Solicitor General to the members of the Court, Justice Frankfurter had an extended talk with his former student. The justice advised Cox that the first case to argue should be something involving criminal law. Cox gave due weight to the recommendation, but he met vigorous objections from his assistant [[Oscar Hirsh Davis|Oscar Davis]] who argued that civil rights was the most important legal issue facing the country and that Cox should signal in his first argued case the new administration's commitment to fight for it.  Cox agreed and selected ''[[Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority]]''.&lt;ref&gt;365 U.S. 715 (1961).&lt;/ref&gt; The case, brought by an African-American who was barred from a private restaurant that rented space in a building owned by the state of Delaware, confronted the Court squarely with the limitations on the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] guarantee of "equal protection of the laws" - erected by the so-called [[Civil Rights Cases]] of 1883, which held that the constitutional guarantee only applied against "state action."&lt;ref&gt;For an examination of the state of constitutional jurisprudence on "state action" at the time that Cox became Solicitor General, ''see'' {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tndl34&amp;start_page=303&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=2&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;id=311|last=Peters|first=Roger Paul|title=Civil Rights and State Non-Action|work=Notre Dame Lawyer|date=May 1959|pages=303–334|accessdate=March 30, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox persuaded the Court that the fact that the business was a state lessee as well as franchisee, was located in a parking complex developed by the state to promote business, and that the complex flew a Delaware flag in front of the building, all rendered the state a "joint participant" with the restaurant, sufficient to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=149–151}} The Court agreed.

By May 1961, the civil rights movement, led by [[James Farmer]] of [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]], initiated what would become a wave of non-violent confrontations against discrimination in public transit and other accommodations. The attorney general's office, under the personal supervision of Robert Kennedy, took active measures to protect the protestors in the face of local political and police indifference to or active complicity with violent resisters.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the Justice Department's efforts to protect protestors and employ legal measures to promote voting rights and integration of facilities, see {{harvnb|Schlesinger, Jr.|1978|p=1:329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was regularly involved in meetings over day-to-day Justice Department activities, while at the same time he prepared to argue cases seeking to overturn state court convictions of civil rights protestors (under various statutes dealing with vagrancy, trespass and even parading without a permit.) Cox came into close contact with Robert Kennedy, and while the two had widely different styles (Kennedy was impulsive and somewhat cavalier of legal principles; Cox was cautious against making missteps that would set the movement back or commit the Court to a position on which it might lose its legitimacy), Cox grew to admire Kennedy.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=151–152}} Prior to the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|Ole Miss riot]] the subject reluctantly gave counsel to the President.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=162–163}} Impatient of a piecemeal approach, Robert Kennedy, but more importantly the civil rights community and particularly [[Jack Greenberg (lawyer)|Jack Greenberg]] of the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|NAACP Legal Defense Fund]], sought near elimination of the "state action" doctrine, arguing that restaurants were like "common carriers" subject to the Fourteen Amendment or that the mere act of enforcing a trespass law used to further private discrimination was itself sufficient "state action."{{efn|The former argument found some support in ''[[Boynton v. Virginia]]'', 364 U.S. 454 (1960), which vacated a trespass conviction of an African American eating in a "whites only" facility of a bus station. But that decision was based on the [[Interstate Commerce Act]], which banned segregation (and itself was based on the Commerce Clause and not the Fourteenth Amendment). The second theory had some support in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', 334 U.S. 1 (1948), which made racially discriminatory real estate covenants illegal on the ground that court enforcement of them sufficiently intertwined the state in private discrimination as to amount to "state action." The arguments pressed on Cox, however, went well beyond those precedents in Cox's opinion, however much he agreed with the policy outcome.{{sfn|Hilbink|2000|pp=1:95–97}}}}

Cox did not believe the Court would make so radical a break with eighty-year-old precedent. So in each case he argued on narrow grounds that did not require the Court to overrule the Civil Rights Cases, and each case he won on those grounds, in the process infuriating Jack Greenberg who was arguing in those very cases for the broader approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|pp=158–59}}; {{harvnb|Hilbink|2000|pp=1:97–100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cautious approach, however, garnered Cox much credibility with the Court, which came to realize that he was not going to lead them into areas with uncertain future consequences.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=159}} After a number of these cases, however, even the Court requested briefing in 1962 on the "state action" doctrine in ''[[Bell v. Maryland.]]''  Cox took a slightly more advanced position, arguing that where trespass laws were used to prosecute civil rights demonstrators in states such as Maryland where there was a history of racial segregation by custom and law, then the discrimination was part of the enforcement sufficient to invoke state action. Although even this position disappointed civil rights activists and the Justice Department, it prevailed, but in the face of three dissents (including that of Justice Black), suggesting that a broader rule might have been rejected by a majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|pp=159–60}}; {{harvnb|Hilbink|2000|p=1:98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue would be mooted by legislation dealing with "public accommodations", which Cox helped draft and defended before the Court in 1965.

====Reapportionment cases====
The cases that troubled Cox the most during his tenure, and the area where he differed widest from Robert Kennedy, involved malapportionment of voting districts. Over the years failure to re-allocate voting districts particularly in state legislatures, produced wildly disproportionate districts, with rural areas having many fewer voters than urban districts as a result of the urbanization of America.{{efn|In 1962 more than half the states had failed to re-apportion legislative districts for more than a quarter of a century.{{sfn|Schlesinger, Jr.|1978|p=1:413}}}} The result was dilution of the urban vote with policy resulting accordingly; rectification would benefit Democrats politically, while malapportionment stood as an obstacle to legislation that improved the lot of city-dwellers, minorities and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Terris|first=Bruce J.|title=Attorney General Kennedy versus Solicitor General Cox: The Formulation of the Federal Government's Position in the Reapportionment Cases|work= Journal of Supreme Court History|volume=32|number=3|pages=335, 345, 337|date=November 2007|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5818.2007.00171.x|subscription=yes}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 31, 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was that Justice Frankfurter had written in a plurality decision in 1946 that such issues amounted to a [[political question]]—a matter not appropriate for the Court to resolve.{{efn|Frankfurter's decision in'' [[Colegrove v. Green]]'', 328 U.S. 549 (1946), was joined in by only two other justices. The two others making the majority decided on other grounds.}} On the other hand, given that political interests were entrenched, and those with disproportionate power were not likely to give up their greater share, a political solution was unlikely. But a case surfaced from Tennessee that seemed ideal to test that ruling. Tennessee had not reapportioned its legislature since 1910 and, as a result, there were urban districts that had eleven times the citizens of rural districts. Cox decided to submit an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' brief supporting the plaintiffs in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]''. The case was argued once in April 1961 and re-argued in October. In between Cox was subjected to an unpleasant onslaught by Frankfurter at a public dinner and relentless questions in the October argument.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=165–68}} When the decision was announced, however, Frankfurter was joined by only Harlan; the result was 6-2.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Baker v. Carr]]'', 369 U.S. 186 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case proved far easier than Cox expected.{{efn|It also became, to Warren's mind on his retirement, the single most important contribution to Constitutional law during his tenure: "I think ''Baker v. Carr'' was the most important case that we decided in my time, because that gave to the courts the power to determine whether or not we were to have fair representation in our governmental system, and ''Reynolds v. Simms'' [377 U.S. 533 (1964)] was merely the application of that principle."{{sfn|Lake|1969|p=130}}}} The holding was relatively narrow, simply providing federal court jurisdiction, and followed the points in Cox's brief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cwrlrv62&amp;start_page=1109&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;id=1147|last=Solimine|first=Michael E.|title=Congress, the Solicitor General, and the Path of Reapportionment Litigation|work=Case Western Reserve Law Review|volume=62|number=4|date=Summer 2012|pages=1109–52, 1121|accessdate=March 31, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Cox had much more difficulty with the follow up cases, because he could not persuade himself that history or legal theory would demand a one-man-one-vote standard in all cases. He developed what he later called a "highly complex set of criteria," but in the end when the Court finally erected the one-man-one-vote standard it simply made the general rule subject to all the exceptions that Cox had tried to weave into his proposed standards. As Chief Justice Warren's clerk later told him "all the Chief did was take your brief and turn it upside down and write exceptions to the one-person one-vote that covered all the cases that you had attempted to exclude by this complicated formula.".{{sfn|Hilbink|pp=2:168–69}} The case was ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'', 377 U.S. 533 (1964), holding that election districts must be roughly proportional to population.

====After Kennedy====
After President Kennedy's assassination, Deputy Attorney General [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] became Cox's direct superior The first request of the acting attorney general was that Cox accompany him to see the chief justice and request him to head a commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy. Cox was reluctant, believing that Warren should refuse the request, because it would have adverse impact on the Court. He agreed but asked that Katzenbach not have him try to persuade the chief justice. In the end Warren declined the request, and the two Justice employees left.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=184–86}} Within an hour President  [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] called Warren, who capitulated. Warren said in 1969 that because of it, it became "the unhappiest year of my life."{{sfn|Lake|1969|pp=SM133-34}}

The civil rights legislation that Kennedy was unable to see pass during his lifetime received the needed momentum from his death and the legislative skill of President Johnson. In 1964 the public accommodations bill passed as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The obvious constitutional attack on the legislation was its constitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment because it sought to regulate conduct that was not "state action." Cox and Assistant Attorney General and Head of the Civil Rights Division [[Burke Marshall]], however founded the legislation on Congress's [[Commerce Clause|power to regulate interstate commerce]]. Although both John and Robert Kennedy questioned the optics of using the Commerce Clause, they did not object.{{sfn|Marshall|1970|p=5}} Cox had no difficulty having the Court uphold the statute on that basis when he argued the cases in October.{{efn|''See'' ''[[Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States]]'', 379 U.S. 241 (1964) and ''[[Katzenbach v. McClung]]'', 379 U.S. 294 (1964). There was no dissent in either case.}}

After a landslide election victory, Johnson used his State of the Union address in January 1965 to, among other things, promise a voting rights act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/650104.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020416162913/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/speeches.hom/650104.asp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 16, 2002|title=Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union|date=January 4, 1965|publisher=LBJ Presidential Library Website|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Cox who developed the first draft. The mechanism devised by Cox was to provide for a presumption of illegality of a list of practices including literacy tests and similar devices if the state had a history of low minority voter turn-out as shown by voter statistics. In such cases the burden was shifted to the state to prove nondiscriminatory intent. This mechanism remained the heart of the legislation throughout the legislative process. Both Ramsey Clark and Nicholas Katzenbach admired the mechanism for its legal craftsmanship and statecraft (because it avoided the need to prove intent to discriminate).{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=190–91}} Before the bill was submitted to Congress Cox answered a question in Court that was used by nationally syndicated columnist [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] to embarrass Cox before the new president. On January 28, Cox urged the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court decision that held that the federal government had no power to sue a state alleging violation of the Fifteenth Amendment by discriminatory devices aimed at African-Americans. Cox argued the narrow ground that the government had such power. When the Court expressly asked Cox whether he was asking the Court to strike down the statutes, Cox answered that he was not, only that the case be remanded to the three-court panel. The Court's opinion, delivered on March 8, highlighted this exchange in such a way that some inferred that Cox passed up a golden opportunity.{{efn|"While the Government has argued that several provisions of the Mississippi laws challenged here might or should be held unconstitutional on their face without introduction of evidence or further hearings, with respect to all the others, the Solicitor General in this Court specifically has declined to 'urge that the constitutionality of these provisions be decided prior to trial.' In this situation, we have decided that it is the more appropriate course to pass only upon the sufficiency of the complaint's allegations to justify relief if proved." ''United States v. Mississippi'', 380 U.S. 128, 143 (1965) (Black, J.).}} Pearson's column stated that Cox had cost the civil rights movement two years in litigation, and for that he point blank suggested that Johnson replace Cox as solicitor general.&lt;ref&gt;For one of the papers the column appeared in, ''see'' {{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4987587/pearson_criticizes_cox_for_narrow/|last=Pearson|first=Drew|title=Chance to Kill Dixie Voting Law Muffed|work=Hagerstown, Md. Morning Herald|date=March 13, 1965|page=5|accessdate=April 18, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 mooted that case, and Cox would go on to defend the legislation successfully before the Court,&lt;ref&gt;''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'', 383 U.S. 301 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; but he did so as a private attorney.{{efn|Cox represented the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which supported the Act.}} In the summer after Johnson's victory Cox offered his resignation in order that Johnson might pick his own Solicitor General if he chose. Although Cox dearly loved the job,{{efn|Cox was quoted as saying: "My whole life and career has trained me to look upon the Solicitor's office as second only to God."{{sfn|Navasky|1971|p=281}} Years later, after arguing the [[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke|''Bakke'']] case in 1977, Cox told a reporter from the ''Boston Globe'': "There's nothing quite like being back before the Supreme Court."&lt;ref name="Gormley 1997 405"&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} he overrode Katzenbach's strong objections to his decision. Johnson accepted the resignation on June 25, 1965.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=193–94}}

Chief Justice Warren was "non-plussed and made unhappy by the news" that Cox was not reappointed.&lt;ref name="Gormley 1997 195"&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Kennedy delivered a tribute from the well of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/07/14/archives/appointment-assailed.html|last=UPI|title=Appointment Assailed|work=New York Times|date=July 14, 1965|page=21|accessdate=April 25, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even years later his colleagues in the Justice Department praised his service. [[John W. Douglas]], for example, said "he was the best solicitor general that the department's ever had … ."{{sfn|Douglas|1970|p=17}} [[John Seigenthaler]] likewise found him "great."{{sfn|Seigenthaler|1966|p=474}} Students of the office have agreed. [[Lincoln Caplan]] called him one of the three most respected Solicitors General in history (together with [[Robert H. Jackson]] and [[John W. Davis]]).{{sfn|Caplan|1987|p=10}} Bruce Terris, who was Assistant Solicitor General in three administrations, said that he "was the best oral advocate I ever saw. … He had the ability to do something I had never seen anybody ever having the ability to do, and I suspect very few people ever had, and that was he had the ability to lecture the Supreme Court. "{{sfn|Terris|2015|pp=4–5}} Even critic Victor Navasky wrote that Cox was "by general agreement one of the most distinguished Solicitors General in the history of the office … ."&lt;ref name="Navasky 1971 280"&gt;{{harvnb|Navasky|1971|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Solicitor General Cox personally argued over 80 cases before the Court, winning 88%.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=191}} A study of the eight Solicitors General between 1953 and 1982 found that Cox was the most liberal, filing liberal briefs in 77% of the cases.{{sfn|Clayton|1992|p=60}} Supreme Court litigation was his metier, so much so that he would continue to do it in the future even (or especially) when he received no fee.

In 1965, Cox returned to Harvard Law School as a visiting professor, teaching a course in current constitutional law and a section in criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hlrec41&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=44&amp;id=23|last=Joseph|first=Daniel M.|title=Prof. Cox Tells of High Court Advocacy|work=Harvard Law Record|date=October 7, 1965|volume=41|number=2|page=7|accessdate=April 18, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watergate special prosecutor==
{{watergate|Judiciary}}
{{Main|Watergate scandal}}

===Terms of engagement===
Cox was at Berkeley on May 16, 1973, when Secretary of Defense Elliot Richardson, President Nixon's nominee for attorney general, called him to ask if he would consider taking the position of Special Prosecutor in the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate affair]].{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=231–32}} Cox had woken up that morning, the day before his 61st birthday, without hearing in his right ear (a condition his doctor would tell him a few days later was permanent),{{sfn|Gornley|1997|pp=237, 239–40}} which dampened his enthusiasm for the job---the sensing of which, perhaps, increased Richardson's willingness to make concessions to obtain Cox's consent. Richardson, for his part, was getting "desperate" according to his aide John T. Smith.{{sfn|Gormley|19978|p=236}} It was clear that the Senate would make the appointment of a Special Prosecutor a condition of Richardson's confirmation.{{efn|Nixon's previous attorney general, [[Richard Kleindienst]], had resigned at the request of the president (together with chief of staff [[H. R. Haldeman]] and Nixon counsel [[John Ehrlichman]]) on the same day that White House counsel [[John Dean]] was fired as part of Nixon's attempt to get out front of the scandal publicly.{{sfn|Kutler|1990|pp=318–319}} In hindsight it was probably a mistake to create a vacancy at Justice. No one was then calling for Kleindienst's resignation, but once he resigned the perception was fixed that two attorneys general in a row (the first being John Mitchell) had been tainted with Watergate allegations. Even Senate Republicans now called for the appointment of a Special Prosecutor by a resolution that received unanimous Senate consent. Now that a new attorney general had to be confirmed, Senate Democrats had the leverage to make the appointment of a Special Prosecutor inevitable.{{sfn|Emrey|1992|pp=351–56}}}} Richardson's staff had prepared a list of 100 candidates. Richardson did not recall how many he had contacted before Cox.{{sfn|Kutler|1990|pp=329–330}} Given their mutual respect,(Like Cox, Richardson came with an illustrious pedigree, only his could be traced back to the earliest settlers in Boston and therefore he was counted among the [[Boston Brahmin]]. Richardson attended Harvard College and Law School (where he was president of the ''Harvard Law Review''), had been a student of Cox's, and, like Cox, clerked for Judge Hand (1947–48) and been associated with Ropes &amp; Gray.&lt;ref name="CSpanInt"/&gt; But Richardson had the additional advantage of having also clerked for Frankfurter (1948–49) and indeed was considered one of Frankfurter's all-time favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=940CE5DF123DE63ABC4851DFB3668388669EDE&amp;legacy=true|last=Lydon|first=Christopher|title=Richardson and Justice: 'Where you stand depends on where you sit'|work=New York Times Magazine|date=May 20, 1973|p=31, at 92|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825231216/https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=940CE5DF123DE63ABC4851DFB3668388669EDE&amp;legacy=true|archive-date=2017-08-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson, who negotiated with Frankfurter to allow him one hour every morning to read Shakespeare, so impressed Frankfurter that the latter proposed him for the presidency of Harvard in 1953, even though he was only 33.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/01/us/elliot-richardson-dies-79-stood-up-nixon-resigned-saturday-night-massacre.html|work=The New York Times|last=Lewis|first=Neil A.|title=Elliot Richardson Dies at 79; Stood Up to Nixon and Resigned In 'Saturday Night Massacre'|date=January 1, 2000|page=B7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson had sought out Cox's career advice.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=86–87}} And despite Richardson's affiliation with the Republican Party, in 1967 Cox supported Richardson for attorney general of Massachusetts, an election Richardson won.&lt;ref name="SupportRich"&gt;See {{harvnb|Gormley|200|1997|p=200}}; {{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4991326/kennedy_aides_support_elliot_richardson/|title=7 on Law School Faculty at BC Back Richardson|work=North Adams [mass.] Transcript|date=November 1, 1966|page=4|accessdate=April 18, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) over two days of phone conversations Richardson was able to satisfy Cox's concern over independence, and Richardson reduced it to writing.

The resulting "compact" was extraordinary even under the circumstances. The scope was "all offenses arising out of the 1972 election … involving the president, the White House staff or presidential appointments." It was thus not limited to Watergate. The assumption of responsibility for a case was left to the discretion of the Special Prosecutor, who also had sole discretion to decide "whether and to what extent he will inform or consult with the attorney general" on any matter being investigated. The White House thus lost its access to the investigation. In addition, the Special Prosecutor was granted the right to discuss his findings and progress with the press at his discretion. Finally, Cox could be dismissed only by Richardson and only for "extraordinary improprieties"—a standard virtually impossible to meet.{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=357}} The importance of the selection to Richardson's confirmation was highlighted by the fact that he brought Cox along to his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Democratic Whip Senator [[Robert Byrd]] asked Cox if he needed broader authority. Cox replied that he already had "the whip hand." Cox said that the only restraint the president or the Justice Department had over him was to fire him. He also vowed that he would follow the evidence even if it led "to the oval office."{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=331}} Richardson was confirmed.

===Reaction===
The president publicly welcomed the selection and, consistent with his new public relations offensive, commended Richardson's "determination" to get to the bottom of the affair.{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=332}} Privately, Nixon seethed with anger. In his memoir he said: "If Richardson searched specifically for the man whom I least trusted, he could hardly have done better."{{sfn|Emery|1994|pp=356–57}} Richardson, however, thought he had the best man for the job, because once Cox cleared the president there would be no hint that he colluded with Nixon or even that he was sympathetic. Richardson had perhaps been misled about what his assignment was (and what the president's true intentions were) when the president instructed him the night [[Richard Kleindienst|Kleindienst]] was dismissed to "get to the bottom of it" "no matter who[m] it hurts." Richardson was to "stand firm" only on two issues: presidential conversations were to remain privileged and national security matters were not to be investigated. Otherwise "I don't give a Goddam what it is—[[John N. Mitchell|Mitchell]], [[Maurice Stans|Stans]]—anybody." If there were any doubt, the president insisted to Richardson: "You've got to believe I didn't know anything."{{sfn|Kutler|1990|pp=328–29}}

Official Washington, however, was skeptical; Cox, they thought, would be ineffective; he was "too soft—not nasty enough."&lt;ref name="LewisTrib"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19751021&amp;id=EnApAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=840,2128305|last=Lewis|first=Anthony|title=A Tribute to Archibald Cox|work=Dayton Beach Morning Journal|date=October 21, 1975|page=4A|accessdate=March 31, 2016}} (From the ''New York Times News Service.'')&lt;/ref&gt; [[James S. Doyle|James Doyle]], a ''Washington Star'' reporter who would later become the chief press advisor for Cox's group, described his own first reaction to meeting Cox: "Prosecutors are supposed to have the instincts of a shark; this one seemed more like a dolphin."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=48}} That Cox was insufficiently attuned to the politics of his situation was on show when he invited to his swearing-in Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] (the one Democrat whom Nixon loathed and feared) as well as Robert Kennedy's widow; had it take place in his old solicitor general's office; and had his old boss, President Roosevelt's Solicitor General Charles Fahy, administer the oath. It convinced Nixon that Cox saw his job as to bring down the president. Nixon now regarded him as a 
"partisan viper."{{sfn|Kutler|1997|p=332}} Not long afterwards, Cox offended Senate Democrats as well by revealing at a press conference a letter requesting Senator Sam Ervin to cancel or at least postpone the Senate Watergate hearings so that he could familiarize himself with the proceedings.{{efn|''See'' {{harvnb|Doyle|1977|p=67}}. Cox wanted to establish his independence, but mostly the request was to protect the integrity of the prosecutions. National publicity might make it impossible for defendants to receive a fair trial, requiring indictments to be dismissed. Defendants and witnesses could watch the testimony and fashion their own accordingly. More significantly, the Senate could grant immunity to witness, to require them to testify, and thus possibly fatally compromise a prosecution. Cox was serious enough about the point that he made a motion to Judge Sirica, who was presiding over the Watergate prosecutions, requesting that he postpone the hearings. Alternately he asked that the court prohibit television coverage of the hearings. Cox also asked the court to prohibit the Senate Committee from granting use immunity to John Dean and [[Jeb Stuart Magruder]]. Cox's lawyers researched the points but determined that the judge would deny the motion (which he eventually swiftly did). When Cox realized he would lose, he sent his assistant [[Philip Heymann]] to argue the motion.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=272–73}} The court denied the motion is all respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B00E0D9123DE63ABC4B52DFB0668388669EDE|last=Ripley|first=Anthony|title=Immunity Denied: But Sirica Grants It in the Senate Inquiry|work=New York Times|date=June 13, 1973|page=1|accessdate=April 22, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ervin told the press: "Professor Cox's request is extraordinarily arrogant."{{efn|Quoted in {{harvnb|Doyle|1977|p=68}}. Committee Counsel Sam Dash used the same word describing their encounter when he visited Cox and Vorenberg on their first day in their offices. Cox told Dash that "you've got to close down your investigation" because it would interfere with the investigation. Dash said he told Cox: "For God's sakes, Archie, we have separation of powers. Our function is quite different than yours. We're supposed to inform the public and ultimately to reform legislation. You're a prosecutor. You're going to be trying to send people to jail. ... This is such an emergency that the public should know now what happened that we can't wait that long and I'm going to recommend to Ervin to say ‘no' to you."{{sfn|Dash|2002|p=176}}}}

===Staffing up===
After he was sworn in on May 25, 1973, Cox returned to Cambridge where he recruited two professors, [[James Vorenberg]] and [[Philip Heymann]], to join his staff. The three arrived in Washington on May 29. Cox was faced with reports that the team of federal prosecutors under [[Earl J. Silbert]] was about to resign unless given a vote of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5030149/cox_faces_resignation_by_federal?|last=AP wire service|title=Cox Takes Over Watergate Case|work=Beckley [W.V.] Post-Herald The Raleigh Register|date=May 26, 1973|page=8|accessdate=April 22, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox appealed to their sense of professionalism without comment on how the case was handled.{{efn|Silbert believed he was unfairly accused of failing to follow up leads and confining the investigation for political reasons.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=257}} He believed that his strategy of prosecuting the burglars, seeking maximum sentences and then after conviction requiring them to testify under immunity ultimately produced first the disclosures of McCord, then the cooperation of Magruder and Dean.{{sfn|Silbert|1992|pp= 76, 100–01, 112–13}} But as Heymann pointed out, the purpose of the appointment of a Special Prosecutor was precisely to "substitute his credibility" for that of Silbert's.{{sfn|Gormley|p=257}}}} A bigger problem was Silbert's boss, [[Henry E. Petersen]], a career FBI/Justice Department employee appointed Assistant Attorney General by Nixon, who had regular meetings with Nixon, but would only provide vague descriptions to Cox, and point blank refused to turn over his memorandum of one such meeting, claiming executive privilege on behalf of Nixon.{{efn|The meeting between Petersen and the president that was the focus of the first conversation took place on April 15, 1973. Cox and Vorenberg were concerned about leaks and whether confidential grand jury information was being misused. Petersen insisted that the president agreed that he should not receive any grand jury material.  During the course of the interview Petersen mentioned that Nixon had a tape of a conversation he had with Dean (during which Dean claimed the Justice Department was about to give him immunity). Cox did not follow up on that clue.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=55–58}} Later proceedings would show that Petersen had kept Dean informed of grand jury testimony,{{sfn|Emery|1994|pp=213–14}} brief the president on Dean's testimony,{{sfn|Emery|pp=325–26}} and gave Nixon a written summary of the evidence against Haldemann and Ehrlichman.{{sfn|Emery|1994|pp=341–42}} Nixon discussed these materials with both his aides. As for the April 15 meeting, when the tapes were finally produced, the tape for that meeting was missing.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=57}}}}

Cox concluded that a top priority was to hire a pre-eminent criminal trial attorney to supervise the prosecutors until the office was up and running and then try the cases after indictment. He persuaded [[James F. Neal]], the U.S. attorney who obtained the conviction of Jimmy Hoffa in 1964 for jury tampering, now in private practice, to come aboard for several weeks to stabilize the ship. Neal would stay to the end, at the end of each promised period promising only a few more weeks; he became Cox's number two man, picked to be the chief trial attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doyle|1977|p=52}}; {{harvnb|Gormley|1997|pp=261–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Vorenberg became number three and spent much of the early period recruiting lawyers. Vorenberg divided the mission into five task forces:{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=61–65}} the first to sign on was [[Thomas F. McBride]] who would head up the task force on campaign contributions and would obtain the conviction of [[George Steinbrenner]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/05/local/me-mcbride5|title=Thomas F.

[[Henry S.

===Joining issue===
The Special Prosecutor's office had to catch up with the federal prosecutors. The Senate Watergate committee was in competition for Dean's testimony,{{sfn|Dash|2002|pp=174–75}} and leaks suggested they were about to get it. On June 3, published reports said that Dean would testify that he had spoken to the president about Watergate 35 times. On the next day the Deputy White House spokesman admitted that the two spoke frequently, but insisted that the discussions were in furtherance of the president's new determination to get to the bottom of the scandal. The spokesman admitted there were logs of all such conversations, but that they would not be turned over on the ground that they were covered by "executive privilege."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/05/archives/nixondean-talks-on-case-conceded-by-white-house.html|last=Herbers|first=John|title=Nixon-Dean Talks on Case Conceded by White House|work=New York Times|date=June 5, 1973|page=1|accessdate=April 22, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Cox could litigate the issue of executive privilege and his entitlement to the documents, he had to fashion a reasonably specific subpoena that might be enforced in court. But he had no idea how the White House files were organized, so he scheduled a meeting with the president's counsel on June 6 to discuss his documents request.

The president's new defense team was made up of one-time Democrat [[Leonard Garment]], University of Texas constitutional law professor [[Charles Alan Wright]], and Nixon true believer [[J. Fred Buzhardt]]. Cox made three requests: the Petersen document concerning his meeting with Nixon; Petersen's memorandum to Haldeman summarizing the same meeting; and the tape of the conversation between Nixon and Dean mentioned by Petersen from the same meeting. Vorenberg added a request for all logs between the president and key aides from June 1972 to May 1973. Buzhardt said that only the president could determine what he would produce. Garment and Wright argued about executive privilege, which Wright said applied not only to presidential documents but ones of his aides such as Haldeman and Ehrlichman. As for the tape of the April 15 Dean meeting, Buzhardt (falsely) suggested it was not a tape ''of'' the meeting but rather the president's later dictated tape ''about'' the meeting.  No resolution was arrived at, but the president's lawyers did not reject the requests outright.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=274–77}}

The president's legal team employed an approach that would become familiar: state an overly broad position, equivocate, delay, and then abruptly make partial concessions in the face of perceived popular disapproval. Shortly after their meeting, Cox announced a sudden press conference (unrelated to the discovery dispute). Buzhardt, thinking that Cox planned to go public with the dispute over the documents, called Vorenberg. Instead of discussing the press conference Vorenberg reminded Buzhardt of the documents requests. Buzhardt assured Vorenberg that a package would soon be delivered. Twenty minutes before the press conference, the package arrived containing the logs of presidential meetings and telephone conferences with key aides, including Dean, Haldeman, and Ehrlichman.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=278}}; {{harvnb|Doyle|1977|pp=91–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The press conference took place and involved (as was originally planned) only an introduction to several new attorneys. The documents, however, together with the logs of Haldeman and Ehrlichman themselves proved essential to draft subpoenas sufficiently specific to elicit documents, and more crucially when their existence would later become known, the tapes.

By mid-June the office was fully functioning. Silbert's U.S. attorney's team was finally eased out on June 29, much to the chagrin of the federal prosecutors.{{efn|The prosecutors were broadsided on June 21 by an ''amicus'' brief of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] in support of McCord's motion to vacate his conviction. The ACLU brief urged the court to vacate all the convictions based on multiple frauds perpetrated on the court by prosecutors who had engaged in a "sham prosecution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/21/archives/aclu-urges-a-new-watergate-trial-charging-all-of-those-responsible.html|last=Rugaber|first=Walter|title=A.C.L.U.

He requested a vindication of his teams' proceedings. Cox replied that he saw nothing that showed they acted other than pursuant to the "honest judgment" and in "complete good faith."{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=280–83}}}} The task force that was to show the first results was McBridge's campaign finance group. On July 6, American Airlines admitted that it made an illegal $55,000 campaign contribution to Nixon's personal lawyer [[Herbert W.

===White House tapes===
Herb Kalmbach, especially of interest to the illegal campaign contributions task force,{{efn|Kalmbach was Nixon's personal lawyer who specialized in raising large sums for Nixon's campaigns from large corporations. Even before the Watergate break-in Kalmbach was known as one from whom White House influence could be purchased for cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/16/archives/exclusive-coast-club-spurs-gifts-of-millions-for-nixon-and-gop.html|last=Holless|first=Everett R.|title=Exclusive Coast Club Spurs Gifts Of Millions for Nixon and G.O.P.|work=New York Times|date=February 16, 1972|pages=1. 20|accessdate=April 24, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only was he the chief fundraiser in the 1972 campaign he was one of very few who could draw on money from a "secret political espionage fund."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/11/archives/nixons-attorney-tied-to-fund-role-deposition-filed-in-court.html|last=Franklin|first=Ben A.|title=Nixon's Attorney Tied to Fund Role|work=New York Times|date=February 11, 1973|page=29|accessdate=April 22, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} was scheduled to testify before the Senate Watergate Committee on July 16. Instead, Haldeman's aide Col. [[Alexander Butterfield]] was inserted as a "mystery witness." During his 30-minute testimony he revealed the secret taping system that was installed in the Oval Office, the president's office at the Executive Office Building, and at Camp David)—a voice-activated mechanism designed to capture everything spoken by or to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1994|pp=368–70}}; {{harvnb|Doyle|1977|pp=92–93}}; {{harvnb|Kutler|1990|pp=368–70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of the tapes was the biggest piece of evidence unearthed by the Senate Watergate Committee; around it much of the remainder of the [[cover-up]] case would revolve.{{efn|Aside from Butterfield's testimony, all the testimony televised by the Watergate Committee had been developed by the federal prosecutors in the District of Columbia U.S. attorney's office.{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=382}} Moreover, the presentation by the committee was largely inept in the opinion of the Special Counsel's staff. Dean, for example, escaped serious cross-examination. The committee allowed burglar [[Bernard Barker]] to testify without serious challenge to the patriotic motives of his cohorts, explaining that he believed that the Watergate Hotel contained evidence that [[Fidel Castro]] was sending money to Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]. And no one asked him how money from the Nixon campaign committee ended up in his bank account.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=97}} Nevertheless, without the disclosure of the tapes, the eventual outcome would have been in substantial doubt.}}

The materiality of certain tapes was self-evident. Tapes of conversations testified to by John Dean would either show that Dean's account was accurate, in which case the president was complicit in obstruction of justice, or false, in which case Dean committed perjury in his testimony to the Senate. The relevance of other tapes could be inferred from the proximity of meetings to Watergate-related events. Cox believed he could maximize his chance for a favorable ruling by limiting the scope of his initial request to material arguably important to the criminal proceedings. Once he obtained a ruling that executive privilege gave way to a compelling need in a criminal prosecution, he could ask for additional material later. So on July 18 Cox sent Buzhardt a written request for eight specific tapes.{{efn|One tape requested covered the meeting of Nixon, Haldeman, and Ehrlichman on June 20, 1972, their first meeting after the break-in. The remaining seven tapes covered meetings between Dean and Nixon in September 1972 and the spring of 1973. Since Dean had testified about these meetings with the permission of the president, Nixon arguably waived any privilege that may have attached to them.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=96}}}} On July 23, Wright responded in writing denying the request on grounds of executive privilege and separation of powers. That evening Cox had a grand jury subpoena demanding the eight tapes and three other items{{efn|The three additional items consisted of: a tape of a meeting on March 21; a memo of March 30 between two White House personnel employees concerning Hunt's employment; and memoranda between [[Gordon C. Strachan|Gordon Strachan]] and Haldeman from November 1971 to November 1972 concerning sale of ambassadorships. The second item had been voluntarily delivered to the FBI. Its inclusion was designed to bolster the waiver argument. The third group was designed to show that the White House interested itself in political matters and therefore privilege covering his "executive" function should not apply.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=103–04}}}} served on Buzhardt who accepted on behalf of the president.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=92–99, 101–05}}

On July 26, Chief Judge [[John J. Sirica]]{{efn|By virtue of being chief judge of the United States Court for the District of the District of Columbia Sirica handled all grand jury matters.{{sfn|Silbert|1992|p=78}} He also was the trial judge of the original Watergate break-in case.}} received a letter from Nixon himself responding to the subpoena in which he asserted that it would be as inappropriate for the court to compel him as it would for him to compel the court. He was therefore not producing the tapes. But he included a copy of the March 30 memo concerning Hunt's employment and promised to make available the Strachan political documents concerning ambassadorships. Within an hour Cox was before the grand jury, explaining the response to them; they voted to request Sirica to issue an order to Nixon to show cause why there should not be prompt compliance with the subpoena. Sirica had the members individually polled and issued the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dolye|1977|pp=105–06}}; {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/27/archives/nixon-contests-subpoenas-keeps-tapes-hearing-set-a-ug-7-on-historic.html|last=Apple|first=R.W.|title=Nixon Contests Subpoenas, Keeps Tapes, Hearing Set Aug. 7 on Historic Challenge|work=New York Times|date=July 27, 1973|pp=1, 8|accessdate=April 24, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirica allowed the parties a month to brief the issue, which came for a hearing on August 22. Wright took a broad, absolutist position claiming the president was the only person who could decide what materials to turn over to them. He relayed Nixon's feelings on national security, saying that Nixon told him that one tape had "national security information so highly sensitive that he did not feel free to hint to me what the nature of it is" despite Wright's full national security clearance. Wright said that the president's power was so inclusive that he could terminate the Special Prosecutor's office and have all the cases dismissed. Cox, on his turn, emphasized the peculiar situation here where there "is strong reason to believe the integrity of the executive office has been corrupted" and pointed out that the president had permitted his staff to testify about the meetings covered by the tapes but refused to turn over the tapes themselves,{{efn|A stark example was seen when Haldeman had been given access to the tapes to prepare his testimony and then having "refreshed his recollection" about the meetings testified before the Senate Watergate Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/05/archives/an-unexpected-ploy-adds-a-question-to-a-dilemma.html|last=Weaver, Jr.|first=Warren|title=An Unexpected Ploy Adds a Question to a Dilemma|work=New York Times|date=August 5, 1973|page=161|accessdate=April 24, 2016|subscription=yes}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1994|pp=370–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ordinarily when a witness uses material to refresh his recollection, the cross-examiner is entitled to see it and have it received into evidence if he so moves. This tradition is reflected as for "writings" in Federal Rule of Evidence 612(b).}} which would be the better evidence of what transpired. As for the claim that the president could terminate his commission, Cox said (presciently in hindsight) that even if were true, then the president would have to accept the political repercussions that would follow exercising that power. After questioning Wright for about 17 minutes (and Cox only 8), the judge said he hoped to have a decision within a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B05E2D6103DE63ABC4B51DFBE668388669EDE|last=Weaver, Jr.|first=Warren|title=Tape Case Argued in Federal Court: Sirica Will Decide in Week|work=New York Times|date=August 23, 1973|pages=1, 29|accessdate=April 24, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, the court ordered the president to deliver all the material to him for review. The decision amounted to a rejection of Wright's absolutist argument. Although not a complete victory for Cox,{{efn|The Special Prosecutor's office was particularly concerned with the sentence that "If privileged and unprivileged evidence are so inextricably connected that separation becomes impossible, the whole must be privileged and no disclosure made to the grand jury."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=113}} Cox was concerned that he would have no input into the decision; it would be made by a judge who was unfamiliar with how all the evidence connected. What made the decision to involve himself the more odd was that neither side had suggested or briefed the issue.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=305–06}}}} Sirica ignored the national security argument, and the decision was widely considered as historic—the first time a court ordered a president to produce evidence since Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] in 1807 ordered President [[Thomas Jefferson]] to produce documents. The White House quickly announced that Nixon "will not comply with the order." Wright said that they were considering an appeal, but the statement "hinted that they might find some other method of sustaining the president's legal position."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/08/30/archives/a-historic-ruling-president-first-since-jefferson-directed-to-give.html|last=Weaver, Jr.|first=Warren|title=A Historic Ruling: President First Since Jefferson Directed to Give Up Records|work=New York Times|date=August 30, 1973|pages=1, 21|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president did appeal, but to the public irritation of Wright,{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=114–15}} the Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the proceedings expedited, scheduling argument for the following week before the entire circuit.{{efn|The appellate court moved up the schedule in light of the expiration of the grand jury in early December. A decision by the end of September would also give the Supreme Court a chance to hear the case upon its return on October 1.&lt;ref name="CtExpid"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D03E6D9113DE63ABC4D53DFBF668388669EDE|last=Weaver, Jr.|first=Warren|title=Appellate Court Orders Speed-Up in Tapes Dispute: Slates Argument Next Week Without Waiting for Filing of the President's Plea|work=New York Times|date=September 5, 1973|pages=1, 18|accessdate=April 24, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hearing before the entire circuit rather than the usual three-court panel also deprived the losing party from delay associated with a petition for hearing ''en banc''.}} At the argument on September 11 Wright again took the maximum view of executive privilege. In response to a question by Chief Judge [[David L. Bazelon]], Wright said that he could think of no circumstance that the tapes could be demanded by courts. He said, however, that the White House had made information available, waiving the privilege, but tapes constituted "the raw material of life," something essentially privileged. Wright maintained that the privilege survived even if abused, such as by the president engaging in fraud or other crime. Cox's approach, just as in the sit-in and reapportionment cases, was to avoid asserting a broad legal principle and instead show how the case was ''sui generis'', unlikely to establish a precedent soon relied on, and one that fit easily within existing principles of administration of justice. Observers believed Cox had won.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=117–19}} Instead, the Court's decision two days later (even before the time the court had provided for post-argument briefs&lt;ref name="CtExpid"/&gt;) gave the parties one week to come up with a compromise.&lt;ref name="CtRecom"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0DE3D91030E63ABC4C52DFBF668388669EDE|last=Weaver, Jr.|first=Warren|title=Appellate Court Asks Compromise in Tapes Dispute: Bids Nixon Voluntarily Yield Portions of Recordings to Cox and Wright for Study|work=New York Times|date=September 14, 1973|pages=1, 23|accessdate=April 24, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations, grand jury progress, and the court's decision===
The Circuit Court's recommendation was that the parties come to an arrangement whereby the president would submit portions of the tapes to Cox and Wright who would decide with Nixon what portions would be submitted to the grand jury. Cox announced almost immediately that he was willing to discuss the matter with the White House lawyers. The White House would only say that it was studying the matter; Wright had already returned to Texas. The Court instructed the parties to report back within one week. If no arrangement could be made, it would decide the appeal.&lt;ref name="CtRecom"/&gt;

Nixon had lost patience with Cox and was in no mood to negotiate (even though the court's suggestion strongly implied that it would order production of the tapes if there was no settlement). While the lawyers engaged in delay, Nixon was trying to control Cox through Richardson. For three months, [[Alexander Haig]], H.R. Haldeman's replacement as White House chief of staff, had been directing Richardson to clamp down on Cox with increasingly more explicit threats until it reached the boiling point just at this moment.{{efn|In mid-June Haig complained to Richardson after Cox told reporters he might subpoena the president. Several weeks later he called Richardson to tell him that the president was "very uptight" about Cox and wanted "a line drawn." The president would "get rid" of him if he strayed outside the lines.{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=333}} On July 7 Nixon wrote Haig that he wanted "Richardson to rein in Archibald Cox and take him to task for 'conducting a partisan political vendetta rather than [doing] … the job he was appointed to do—bring the Watergate defendants to trial at the earliest possible date."{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=363}} The incident that infuriated Nixon and set him on a course of inflexible hostility towards Cox took place when Cox requested news clippings concerning the controversy over the source of funds used to renovate Nixon's estate at San Clemente. Haig three times interrupted a meeting Richardson was having with Maryland prosecutors informing Richardson for the first time of the case they were going to bring against Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]]. On the third call Nixon took the phone and demanded that Richardson get Cox to make a retraction within 30 minutes or he would to fire Cox.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=75–76}} The demands, threats and complaints to Richardson continued, until on September 25, just around the time the parties were supposed to be negotiating over the tapes, Nixon concluded a meeting with Richardson by saying that after the Agnew affair was over he wanted to get rid of Cox.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=125}}}} Buzhardt nevertheless made an offer: he would summarize the tapes with each participant's conversations re-written in the third person. It was an unworkable scheme, but Cox decided to continue negotiations over the next several days. Cox then drafted a 6-page counter-proposal providing for transcriptions of the actual conversations together with a third-party certification that the rest of the tape was irrelevant. At the last meeting, when Nixon's lawyers showed willingness to have a third party certify transcripts, Cox gave them his proposal and then left to give them a chance to consider it. In less than an hour Buzhardt called, rejecting the proposal and ending the negotiations. The parties informed the court that they could not reach agreement.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=120–22}}

Aside from the tapes, the Special Prosecutor's office was making substantial progress on all fronts. The Watergate task force was initially stymied in their case against John Dean. Dean's lawyer made a compelling argument that the government could not proceed against him on the basis of the information he proffered during his plea negotiations with Silbert's prosecutors. A court would require a showing that the evidence used by the government had an independent basis than that proffered by Dean. It took careful combing of the file to find a letter from one of the prosecutors to Dean's lawyer noting that Dean had failed to inform them about two specific crimes that two other witnesses disclosed. Dean's lawyer replied that the omission was an oversight. The two letters showed that there existed an independent basis to prosecute Dean. Jim Neal gave Dean until the third week of October to agree to plead to one felony count, with the obligation to become a prosecution witness, or else face indictment on the two separate incidents. The plea before Judge Sirica (known among the criminal bar as "Maximum John") would certainly require prison time, but Dean would likely receive favorable consideration for a reduced sentence if he cooperated.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=127–28}}

The other task forces were also proceeding apace. Connolly's task force was readying perjury indictments: one involved former Attorney General Kleindienst who now admitted that in fact Nixon had ordered him to dismiss the ITT antitrust suit in consideration of ITT's campaign contributions. The dirty tricks task force of Richard Davis obtained a plea of guilty by [[Donald Segretti]] to three counts of illegal campaign activity. It was now preparing a perjury indictment against [[Dwight Chapin]].{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=130}} New information suggested an illegal contribution of $100,000 cash (in $100 bills) from [[Howard Hughes]] through [[Charles Rebozo|Charles "Bebe" Rebozo]] to Nixon's campaign. Inasmuch as Cox had to recuse himself from this case,{{efn|Cox believed that there was an appearance of conflict of interest since his younger brother Maxwell was a member of the New York law firm that represented Howard Hughes.&lt;ref name="Doyle131"&gt;{{harvnb|Doyle|1977|pp=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally syndicated columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] later reported that the feeling at the Special Prosecutor's office was that the Rebozo case more than the desire to shield the tapes was the motivating factor in Nixon's decision to fire Cox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=17AzAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5415,3711393&amp;dq=bebe+rebozo+bagman|last=Anderson|first=Jack|title=Justice Faces True Test in Rebozo Inquiry|work=Bangor [Me.] Daily News|date=October 23, 1973|accessdate=April 25, 2016|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} he assigned it to McBride and authorized Ruth to make all decisions but asked for a prompt and diligent investigation.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=130–31}} The Plumbers task force was considering how to trace the chain of authority in the [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|Fielding break-in case]], given their lack of a high-level cooperating witness, but they had ready perjury indictments against [[John N. Mitchell|John Mitchell]] and [[Egil Krogh]]; Krogh would be indicted October 11.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=128–29, 136–37}} While most of this activity went unreported, people tapped into the network of defense attorneys and grand jury witnesses (including the White House) knew that the noose was being tightened around the president. One reporter told James Doyle that a "middle-level White House guy told him on September 28: "Over here they talk about how to get Cox all the time."&lt;ref name="Doyle131"/&gt;

It was the Krogh indictment that forced Richardson to have another meeting with Cox on October 12. The break-in of [[Daniel Ellsberg]]'s psychiatrist's office was still claimed by the White House to involve national security matters, and Richardson and Cox had an agreement that Cox would notify the attorney general before any indictment in that matter was filed. Richardson wanted to know why he was not notified. Cox, surprised, explained that the agreement did not involve perjury indictments (which could not betray national security secrets, since they would involve public testimony). Richardson, checking his notes of their understanding, agreed with Cox and then apologized for forgetting that provision. He then had a bizarre conversation with Cox during which he said that soon he would have to "push Cox," but that sometimes "it's better to lose your hat than your head." Perplexed, Cox returned to his office and was in the midst of telling Doyle of the conversation, when two lawyers interrupted to say the Circuit Court of Appeals had filed their decision just after 6 p.m.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=133–35}}

The 5-2 decision of the Court of Appeals&lt;ref&gt;''[http://openjurist.org/487/f2d/700/nixon-v-j-sirica-united-states Nixon v. Sirica]'', 487 F.2d 700 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (''en banc'').&lt;/ref&gt; was an utter defeat for the president,{{efn|The court rejected entirely the two broad principles urged by Wright: that separation of powers deprived the court jurisdiction to hear the case and that the president was the only person entitled to decide what items were covered by executive privilege: "Whenever a privilege is asserted, even one expressed in the constitution, such as the speech and debate privilege, it is the courts that determine the validity of the assertion and the scope of the privilege." If an executive privilege exists (and it is not found in the text of the constitution), the court held the privilege is not absolute and the courts, not the president, must be the arbiter. The court then examined the specific circumstances of the case, it found that only a portion of one tape involved military secrets. As for the rest, only a generalized interest in protecting the confidentiality of presidential communications was asserted, and the court found that the particular need of the grand jury in this case overweighed that generalized interest.}} and the papers highlighted the statement that the president was not "above the law's commands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/13/archives/judges-rule-52-historic-decision-finds-president-not-above-laws.html|last=Oelsner|first=Lesley|title=Judges rule 5-2: Historic Decision Finds President Not Above Law's Commands|work=New York Times|date=October 13, 1973|pages=1, 20|accessdate=April 25, 2016|subscription=yes}} Large excerpts from the opinion were printed by the ''Times''. {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/13/archives/excerpts-from-opinion-of-court-of-appeals-on-examination-of.html|title=Excerpts From Opinion of Court of Appeals on Examination of Presidential Tapes|work=New York Times|date=October 13, 1973|page=21|accessdate=April 26, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court modified Judge Sirica's order and required Nixon's lawyers to specify the grounds of any privilege they were claiming as to particular portions of the tape, and Cox was to be furnished with the specifications. Cox was also to be given access to the material in any instance when the Court was in doubt of the relevance to the criminal proceedings. In this case, the court said, "any concern over confidentiality is minimized by the attorney general's designation of a distinguished and reflective counsel as Special Prosecutor." In short, the court required disclosure except for portions that the president could articulate a particularized need for confidentiality, and Cox was permitted to see any portion where Sirica needed guidance on relevance.

===White House ultimatum===
Unlike its actions following the Sirica decision, the White House remained quiet that Friday night and through the weekend following the Court of Appeals ruling. Cox had no response until he met Richardson at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on Monday, October 15. Cox thought this meeting would be a continuation of the "Byzantine" conversation (as Cox called it) from the previous Friday, but instead Richardson appeared now to be the point man on negotiations over the tapes.{{efn|On Saturday October 13, Wright telephoned from Texas that the president should appeal to the Supreme Court. Nixon, however, did not want to take the risk of losing in the Court whose ruling he publicly pledged to respect.{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=401}} As Richardson came to realize later, the plan of Nixon and Haig was to force Cox to resign or at least engineer a situation that made it appear that Cox was in the wrong so as to justify firing him. It was essential for this plan, however, that Richardson appear to be the one negotiating with Cox and, even more importantly, not resign but instead fire Cox when Cox refused Richardson's "reasonable proposal."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1994|p=388}}; {{harvnb|Richardson|1976|pp=39–40}}; {{harvnb|Doyle|1977|pp=140–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday morning Haig had Richardson in the White House and either appealing to his vanity or in an attempt to keep him off balance gave an elaborate presentation on the progress of the [[Yom Kippur War|war by Egypt and Syria against Israel]], which had resulted in a tense standoff between the Soviet Union and the United States the previous week. He then turned to Watergate and told Richardson that Nixon had decided to fire Cox and submit to Sirica summaries of the tapes verified by him. He even had a draft letter directing Richardson to fire Cox. Richardson told him he would resign if he received such a letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Emery|1994|p=388}}; {{harvnb|Richardson|1976|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Buzhardt met Richardson separately and suggested that a third party verifier might be an alternative. Richardson seized on the idea and urged Haig to press in upon the president as a way to avoid adverse public reaction. When back at his office, he received a phone call from Haig saying he would try to persuade the president to use a third party and would suggest Senator John Stennis. An hour later he called again to say that the president would agree on two conditions: Cox would be barred from asking for any more documents, tapes, or other presidential material; and Richardson must agree to fire Cox if the latter balked. Richardson said that he would call back within an hour. When he did, he told Haig that he would not fire Cox under these circumstances. Haig responded by merely saying that he would contact Stennis directly to seek his cooperation. At 4:00 p.m. he again met with Haig and Buzhardt who told him Stennis was on board. They gave him the impression that the Stennis plan was very similar to the plan Cox had proposed but Buzhardt said that plan was confidential and did not give a copy to Richardson.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=143–45}}}} Richardson gave an outline of a proposal to have Senator [[John C. Stennis|John Stennis]] authenticate transcripts of relevant portions of the tapes. Cox was able to infer that Richardson had gotten orders from the White House and was concerned that if a compromise was not reached one or both would be fired. During the 75-minute meeting, Cox asked a long list of questions, including where he would stand with respect to future demands for documents, tapes, or other material. Because he had an engagement, Richardson proposed they meet again in the morning.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=145–47}} The next day Richardson told Cox that if they did not have an agreement by Friday "the consequences will be very serious for both of us." Cox objected to the deadline, suggesting that if their talks continue they could easily get a postponement of any response due the court. Richardson could not explain why there was a deadline and instead wanted to go over the points they had agreed upon, then discuss other issues; but Cox insisted that it was an inefficient way to proceed and gave him his earlier 6-page proposal; and Richardson agreed to write a counter-proposal.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=149–50}}

Cox did not hear from Richardson the rest of Tuesday or Wednesday. There was much disagreement in the Special Prosecutor's office whether Cox should accept the proposal at all. Much of the concern had to do with Senator Stennis, a Nixon supporter, but more importantly a frail, partially deaf&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/12/19/haig-trusted-defender-of-an-embattled-president/8553bbfe-947b-4415-99de-5d5c7eebe82e/&lt;/ref&gt; 72-year-old who only recently had recovered from a near fatal gunshot wound in a mugging in January. Cox was worried that rejecting a deal would risk obtaining anything from the White House. James Neal cautioned that if he rejected a compromise a large part of the country might accuse him of acting like a "super-president" without any checks. Doyle had the opposite concern: if Cox accepted less than the tapes, which the court ordered turned over, he might be seen as part of the cover-up.{{efn|There was some evidence supporting Doyle's view. The much tighter agreement that Cox proposed before the Court of Appeals decision produced this response by Senate Majority Leader, one of the few outside the office who saw it: "Well, you've offered to give ninety percent of it away."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=122}} Richardson now wanted him to give away more.}} James Neal had a suggestion to minimize the Stennis problem—have him appointed by the court as one of several special masters. In that way he could obtain assistance in a publicly regulated manner.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=151–52}} In the midst of the internal debate word came in the afternoon of Wednesday, October 17, that Judge Sirica dismissed the suit of the Senate Watergate Committee against Nixon seeking the tapes. Sirica ruled that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/18/archives/ervin-panel-loses-in-suit-for-tapes-siricarules-courts-lack.html|last=Ripley|first=Anthony|title=Ervin Panel Loses Suit for Tapes|work=New York Times|date=October 18, 1973|pages=1, 30|accessdate=April 28, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It left the Special Prosecutor as the only means by which the tapes could be made public. Pressure on Cox to seek the material increased, while the White House was left with only one avenue to block it and so had added incentive to pressure Richardson to get Cox either to compromise or resign.

At 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Richardson hand-delivered to Cox a draft entitled "A Proposal", which contained the Buzhardt comments. He called Cox at 6:00 for his comments. Cox replied: "I think I should respond in writing, Elliot." That night James Neal and Dean's lawyer worked past midnight finalizing John Dean's plea agreement. At about 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Neal had the lawyer review with Dean the agreement, including the provision that if any testimony he had already given proved materially false, he could be prosecuted for perjury. Neal said that when Dean agreed to the plea deal containing that proviso, he knew that Dean's version of the events was truthful and he also realilzed that "Archibald Cox was in serious trouble with the president."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=153–54}}

On Thursday, October 18, Cox drafted an 11-point reply to Richardson. Cox assured Richardson that he was "not unamenable" to a solution in which he had no direct access to the tapes. But he felt that it was unfair to depend on one individual to be responsible for verification, so he proposed Neal's idea of three "Special Masters" whose identities were disclosed from the start. He commented on the method for determining what portions would be transcribed and suggested that the tapes be subject to analysis for tampering. The comments went by messenger at mid-afternoon. Richardson around 6 p.m. brought it to the White House, where Wright had just returned from Texas (to finalize the appeal papers to the Supreme Court that were due the following day), and although he had just reviewed the "Stennis proposal," he was enthusiastically extolling its reasonableness and holding forth on how the president could convince the American people that it was the solution to the crisis. When shown the Cox counter-proposal, he was outraged that Cox had "rejected" the president's offer. Wright counseled rejection of Cox's counteroffer since he believed the president had a "50–50 chance" in the Supreme Court to win outright.{{efn|Neither Wright nor any of Nixon's other lawyers had been permitted to listen to the tapes, so they did not know how clearly they showed the president's culpability for obstruction of justice at least. They were unable therefore to evaluate how serious a risk a 50% chance of full disclose constituted. Moreover, Wright at least was still unaware that the president had already ruled out presenting his case to the Supreme Court.}} Richardson, perplexed at the opposition to negotiating with Cox, suggested to Wright: "Charlie, why don't you call Archie and see if you can sell it to him."{{efn|Both Richardson and Wright were unaware that the Nixon-Haig plan was to isolate the president's lawyers from the negotiations in order to use Richardson, and his reputation for integrity, to help sell the reasonableness of the plan. Back in his office that night after considering whether he would be able to pressure Cox the way the White House wanted him to, Richardson wrote out a memo entitled "Why I must resign", which concluded that the president's attitude toward Cox was not "fundamentally valid."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=157}}}} That night Wright called Cox and was routed to the phone in Cox's brother's home in Virginia, where Cox was having dinner and playing with his brother's children. Wright gave Cox an ultimatum with four points, the most important of which was that Cox would be given no more tapes beyond the nine that were being transcribed (a condition not in the Stennis proposal).{{efn|The other three were: that only Stennis would be involved, that there would be no "Special Masters" and that Cox himself would have no access to the tapes, only the summaries.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=158}}}} Cox asked that Wright send the points to him in writing so that he could consider them the next day and assured him that he was not rejecting the points outright.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=156–59}}

At 8:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Friday October 19, the day of Nixon's deadline for appealing to the Supreme Court (otherwise the Court of Appeals decision would become final), Cox received a letter from Wright dated the previous night. It purported to confirm Cox's "rejection" of Richardson's "very reasonable proposal." There was no mention of the four conditions. He wrote that he would telephone at 10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to find out if there was any reason to continue talking. Cox, who until then had publicly and privately spoken of the integrity of Wright, told his colleagues: "very clever lies."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=161}} Cox wrote a note to Wright saying that the proposal needed "fleshing out," particularly in light of the conditions Wright had set out in the phone call the previous night, which Cox put in writing for the record. He, Neal, and others then left for Sirica's courtroom to attend the plea hearing on John Dean. The White House, seeing only that a hearing had been scheduled, panicked, not knowing what was to take place; no attorney was present when Ruth and Lacovara arrived to deliver the letter and they left it with the guard. Haig quickly learned of the letter, told Richardson that Cox "rejected" the deal, and summoned him to the White House. To Richardson's surprise, Haig said that it was no longer necessary to fire Cox because the president had gotten bipartisan approval for the deal, there were meetings with the two leading members of the Senate Watergate Committee scheduled, and the plan would be acceptable to both the American people and the courts.

The guilty plea by John Dean (with obligation to cooperate) that morning represented the most significant step so far in the prosecutions.{{efn|Cox was unaware that Nixon had a bigger preoccupation. The ''Miami Herald'' that morning had a front page story that Bebe Rebozo was the subject of an investigation for tax fraud for the $100,000 from Howard Hughes supposedly for Nixon's campaign. Rebozo was on his way to Washington at that very moment. The White House was drawing inferences from all these matters. Later in the day Richardson telephoned to find out if Cox had named Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator in any indictment. With that call Cox realized that paranoia was running high at the White House.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=166, 169}}}} Yet, when Cox returned to the office it remained quiet—Wright had neither called nor responded in writing. When the courts closed, there was still no sign that the president had filed a notice to appeal to the Supreme Court. At 5:23&amp;nbsp;p.m. a letter from Wright arrived, which simply again maintained the reasonableness of the original proposal. Wright closed with a statement of regret that Cox would not agree. Cox now realized that he and Richardson had been allowed to negotiate even though the president had no intention to go beyond the inadequate first proposal. On this conclusion, the lawyers in the office began copying their most important memos for safe keeping.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=170–71}} At 7:20 Richardson phoned Cox at home and read him a letter he just received from Wright informing him the Stennis plan had been agreed to by the leadership of the Senate Watergate Committee and that Cox would be instructed to not pursue any further presidential material. A statement was to be released that night. Cox and Doyle hurried back to the office.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=173–74}} When they obtained the statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/20/archives/text-of-nixons-statement-on-the-watergate-tapes.html|title=Text of Nixon's Statement on the Watergate Tapes|work=New York Times|date=October 20, 1973|page=16|accessdate=April 27, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; they saw it as an attempt to sell the unilateral proposal; it claimed that the plan had the approval of Senators Sam Ervin and [[Howard Baker]], who, the statement falsely said, were the ones who proposed Senator Stennis. Although Cox had refused to agree, Nixon planned to take the proposal to Sirica and instructed his lawyers not to seek Supreme Court review. Given that the statement was riddled with falsehoods,{{efn|When Sam Ervin was reached in North Carolina by Sam Dash the next morning, for example, he said that he had been told that the committee would get complete transcripts not summaries and that he never agreed that the procedure should apply to the Special Prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Doyle|1997|pp=172–73}}; {{harvnb|Kutler|1990|p=404}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Cox that night dictated a press release to Doyle (the staff had gone off for the three-day weekend), and Doyle phoned it in to the wire services, also announcing there would be a press conference on Saturday, at 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=173–77}}

===Saturday Night Massacre===
{{main|Saturday Night Massacre}}
Doyle was able to use his press contacts to secure the ballroom of the National Press Club for the 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. press conference on Saturday, October 20. It was to be broadcast live on NBC and CBS and a summary would be shown during half-time of the football game being shown on ABC. Cox that morning was quite concerned about whether he would be able to take the president on alone. He was well aware that he had no institutional support, and the apparent defection of Sam Ervin of the Senate Watergate Committee profoundly troubled him. "Spineless!" he remarked on reading of it.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=174}} He was also concerned about lack of political support.{{efn|Although political support would have helped level the balance of power, Cox felt it inappropriate for a prosecutor to set out to build it. Heymann said: "In the ominous days before the Saturday Night Massacre when Cox might well have been marshaling political support, he did not, and found himself quite alone among the responsible figures in insisting on access to the crucial tapes when the Senators most involved had accepted an inadequate substitute. He didn't think a prosecutor should be marshaling Congressional support. Indeed, he regretted deeply the few hesitant steps he had taken in that direction when he earlier had reason to fear interference with the execution of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/hlr118&amp;start_page=11&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=0&amp;men_tab=srchresults&amp;id=37|last=Heymann|first=Philip B.|title=Archibald Cox|work=Harvard Law Review|volume=118|number=1|date=November 2004|pages=11, 13|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Just six days before Senator [[George McGovern]] had told the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], which had just taken out newspaper ads calling for Nixon's impeachment, that there was not yet support for it; in fact, there was not even enough strength in the opposition to override vetoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5105508/mcgovern_before_the_aclu/|last=AP wire service|title=McGovern Would Delay Nixon Impeachment|work=[Hagerstown, Md.] Daily Mail|date=October 15, 1973|p=2|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Nixon's statement itself, influential members seemed behind it: Republican Senate minority leader [[Hugh Scott]] called it a "very wise solution." Democratic Speaker [[Carl Albert]] characterized it, noncommitally, as "interesting." Even Senate majority leader Mike Mansfield said it was a way "to avoid a constitutional confrontation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5105536/reaction_to_nixon_statement_on_tapes/|last=UPI|title=Senators Criticize Proposal|work=New Castle [Pa.] News|date=October 20, 1973|page=1|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Joseph Connolly called an aide to liberal Republican Senator [[Richard Schweiker]], he was told that the senator "can't get out front on this."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=178}} At the office, the lawyer staff assembled to discuss the matter as a group for the first time. Philip Heymann had flown in from Cambridge to lend support. They offered contradictory advice, and Cox asked them to go to their offices to write up suggestions for him.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=176, 178}} At 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. he met them again and gave something of a valedictory and urged them to continue working if he were fired. At 12:30, Cox, Phyllis, James Doyle, and John Barker walked to the National Press Club. "He was plenty upset," said Barker.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=348}}

[[File:Archibald Cox-October 20, 1973.png|thumb|right|Archibald Cox at the National Press Club on October 20, 1973]]
Richardson was on the phone when Cox arrived and read to him the text of a letter he had sent to the president that day in which he said that Nixon's instructions gave him "serious difficulties" and outlined several steps that still might save the compromise.{{sfn|Doyle|1977|pp=178–79, 180}} Phyllis, holding his hand, walked him to the stage, where they were photographed. Cox then sat down at the table and began his impromptu remarks.&lt;ref&gt;The press conference can be viewed in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxfwE-ADebM CBS News Special Report] live broadcast. Excerpts of the remarks were published in {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/21/archives/excerpts-from-transcript-of-coxs-news-conference-on-nixons-decision.html|title=Excerpts From Transcript of Cox's News Conference on Nixon's Decision on Tapes|work=New York Times|date=October 21, 1973|page=60|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heymann thought he started out nervous, defensively saying that he was "not out to get the president …"{{sfn|Gormley|1997|page=350}} Once he got into the details of the history and significance of the dispute over the tapes, which involved a patient explanation of criminal procedure, evidence, administrative and constitutional law, he relaxed. Doyle said: "He was folksy, unpretentious, disarming. He seemed the country lawyer, talking good sense."{{sfn|Doyle|p=181}} While he used simple terms and short sentences, he was not patronizing or supercilious. "He offered a masterful professorial performance, designed to explain the legal and constitutional confrontation in terms that struck at the core of the layman's treasured values essential to the American system."{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=405}} He defended established institutions and regular procedure. By contrast, the president's proposal involved deciding that a "court order would not be obeyed." In the place of evidence, which Cox sought, the president proposed providing "summaries"  while the genuine, irrefutable evidence, the tapes of what actually transpired, would be available to only two or three men, "all but one of them the aides to the president and men who have been associated with those who are the subject of the investigation." In describing the course of the negotiations for all information, he showed how the White House lawyers had stalled from the beginning. But he never attacked anyone, at one point taking Buzhardt off the hook: "he has behaved in dealing with me in an entirely honorable way —except that he's too damn slow." With the questions that followed, Cox spent more than an hour, at the end of which his staff handed out copies of the various proposals and correspondence that took place during the week. It was so persuasive a performance that [[Sarah McClendon]], White House correspondent known for her sharp questions, approached Cox and said: "I want to shake your hand, you are a great American."{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=352}} Doyle wrote that it was "the most unusual press conference I have ever attended. The hard-bitten, cynical press corps was rooting for Archibald Cox."{{sfn|Doyle|1977|p=185}} John Douglas said: "It was one of the most spectacular performances, one of two or three press conference ever held in this country which have had a significant effect on public opinion."&lt;ref name=CSMSatNight&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1039163450?|last=Sweeney|first=Louise|title=Archibald Cox|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=June 6, 1980|accessdate=May 4, 2016|via=ProQuest|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The press conference also unravelled the Nixon-Haig plan. Cox did not resign, nor was he cowed by the president's directive. Moreover, instead of exploiting Richardson's reputation for integrity to his own advantage (a key feature on which the plan was based), the president was forced to act in his own name, and Cox was able to draw Richardson to his side by defending him as honorable. So the White House decided to fire Cox. It was unable, however, to make either Richardson or his deputy [[William Ruckelshaus]] carry out the order. Each resigned in turn rather than fire Cox, although the White House later claimed it fired Ruckelshaus. Solicitor General [[Robert Bork]] (third in line at the Justice Department) in a face-to-face meeting with the president agreed to issue the order as the acting attorney general and he also decided not to resign after so doing.{{efn|Nixon's purported reason for firing Cox, as relayed by Haig, was that Cox had embarrassed Nixon during sensitive negotiations during the Middle East war.{{sfn|Richardson|1976|p=39}} Richardson's advice to Bork, not to resign, or at least not to resign after firing Cox, was an important factor for Bork. But "[w]hy Bork acted as he did, exactly how he acted, and what were the consequences of his acts, became matters of some dispute."{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=407}}}} As for the termination itself, Bork sent a written order to Cox by messenger that evening to Cox's home.{{efn|Richardson called Cox earlier that afternoon, informing him that he and Ruckelshaus had resigned and that Bork would be firing him. Cox explained: "Sometime further on, the phone rang and it was the White House operator trying to get our address, and letting us know there was a letter to be delivered. And the messenger got lost in nearby Virginia. Instead of getting there in 20 minutes as he could have, it took him more than an hour. I think when I got the letter, the first thing I said to my wife and daughter was, 'I think they at least owed it to me to send me somebody with a jacket and necktie.' That's the kind of silly remark you make in moments of emotion … I was much more concerned about the issues."&lt;ref name=CSMSatNight/&gt;}}

The White House then fatally overplayed its hand. At 8:25&amp;nbsp;p.m. press secretary [[Ron Ziegler]] announced what would become known as the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]." He explained that Cox had been fired, but added, somewhat gratuitously (and, as it would ultimately transpire, inaccurately), "the office of the Special Prosecution Force has been abolished as of approximately 8 P.M. tonight."{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=400}} Haig compounded the bad publicity by publicly sealing the offices of the Special Prosecutor as well as those of Richardson and Ruckelshaus. He explained his conduct by saying: "You would turn the country into a banana republic if you allowed defiance of the president."{{sfn|Genovese|Morgan|2012|pp=72–73}} To Judge Sirica, who watched it on television, it was the cordoning off of the Special Prosecutor's offices that looked like part of a Latin American coup.{{sfn|Sirica|1979|p=130}} Fred Emery wrote for the ''Times of London'' that there was "a whiff of the Gestapo in the chill October air."{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=401}} FBI agents showed up at the Special Prosecutor's offices at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and briefly prevented deputy prosecutor Henry Ruth from entering. Staffers inside were told they were not permitted to remove any documents, official or personal. At a hastily arranged press conference in the library of the building, Ruth and Doyle explained that they had taken copies of major memos to a safe place the night before, but that they were concerned about the vast amount of material still in the office that had not been presented to the grand jury. Doyle read Cox's statement on his termination: "Whether we shall continue to be a Government of laws and not of men is now for Congress and ultimately the American people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/10/21/archives/cox-office-shut-on-nixons-order-fbi-agents-impound-files-and.html |last=Oelsner|first=Lesley|title=Cox Office Shut on Nixon's Order: F.B.I.

[[File:NYTimes Saturday Night Massacre Front Page.gif|thumb|left|Front page of the ''New York Times,'' October 21, 1973, announcing the [[Saturday Night Massacre]] amid mounting tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union over possible armed conflict in the Middle East.]]
The actions of Nixon and his aides that night produced "results precisely the opposite to what the president and his lawyers had anticipated." Instead of simply removing Cox, "they raised a 'firestorm' of protest that permanently scarred Nixon's credibility with the public, and, most damagingly, with Congressional Republicans and Southern Democrats."{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=406}} Public reaction, even though it was a holiday weekend, was swift and overwhelming. About 450,000 telegrams and cables reached the White House and Congress. Mail and wires were put in bundles then sorted by state. The deluge eclipsed any previous record.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=361–62}} Outside the White House, marchers held signs saying "Honk for Impeachment"; car horns were heard in downtown Washington day and night for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kutler|1990|p=410}}; {{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=362}}; {{harvnb|Emery|1994|p=402}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But more concerning to the White House must have been the political reaction. On Sunday [[John B. Anderson]], Chairman of the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]], predicted that "impeachment resolutions are going to be raining down like hailstorms."{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=402}} [[George H.W. Bush]], then Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]], was so concerned over the electoral consequences that he visited the White House, hoping to persuade the president to rehire Richardson for damage control, perhaps as ambassador to the U.S.S.R.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=362}} On Tuesday, Speaker [[Carl Albert]] began referring impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee with the consent of Gerald Ford.{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=404}} Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment said that the White House was paralyzed. "[H]e thought of little else except to marvel 'over the mischief we had wrought and the public relations disaster we had brought on ourselves.'"{{sfn|Kutler|1990|p=410}}

In the end, Nixon did not even achieve the short-term tactical benefit the maneuver was designed to afford him. On Tuesday afternoon eleven lawyers from the Special Prosecutor's force convened with Wright and Buzhardt in the courtroom of Judge Sirica, for further proceedings on the subpoenas. That weekend Sirica drafted an order to show cause why Nixon should not be held in contempt. He was thinking of a $25,000 to $50,000 a day fine until the president complied.{{sfn|Sirica|1979|pp=167–80}} To everyone's amazement, Wright announced that the president was prepared to produce all the material ordered.{{sfn|Emery|1994|p=406}} Not long afterward, [[Leon Jaworski]] would be appointed Special Prosecutor and, because of Nixon's wounded public standing, was given even more independence than Cox had. Cox would not be part of any of it, however, for after a brief farewell meeting with his staff (whom Jaworski would keep), advising them how important it was that they continue and assuring them of Jaworski's good faith,{{efn|Jaworski at Robert Kennedy's request prosecuted Governor [[Ross Barnett]] of Mississippi for contempt over the integration of the University of Mississippi by Medger Evers. Cox had been so impressed with his integrity (as a Southerner taking on a segregationist politician) and his talent that he split his argument time with him before the Supreme Court.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=163}}}} he and Phyllis drove off in their pickup truck to their place in [[Brooksville, Maine]].

Cox's colleague and friend [[Philip Heymann]] described the effect of that weekend from Cox's address, through the massacre and the reaction:
{{Quote|text=President Nixon asked the country to understand his firing an honest prosecutor so that he could get on with national security business. Cox spoke to the American people about the primacy of the rule of law even during a near-confrontation with the Soviet Union over the Yom Kippur war. Unfrightened, unpretentious, talking from the very depths of his convictions and loyalties to hundreds of millions of individual Americans as one citizen to another, Archie reversed a congressional retreat and found a nation following him along the path of freedom. The people and the Congress rallied to the cause of a professor who, without a hint of anger, spoke mildly about our history and principles, and who made clear that what would happen to him was not an issue. After that the executive was again bound by the laws that make men free, and Archie became a national symbol of the triumph of law.&lt;ref name="HarvTrib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/06.03/15-cox.html|title=Archibald Cox dies at 92|work=Harvard University Gazette|date=June 3, 2004|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cox's case on the tapes did not go to the Supreme Court, but when the president tried to resist a later subpoena by Jaworski, the case made its way to the Court. On July 24, 1974, only three days after oral argument, United States Supreme Court voted by 8 to 0 to reject Nixon's claims of [[executive privilege]] and enforced the subpoena requiring the release of the tapes.{{efn|''[[United States v. Nixon]]'', 418 U.S. 683 (1974) (opinion by Chief Justice Burger, joined in by all except Associate Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] who did not participate in the deliberations). Justice Rehnquist had recused himself on the ground that as an assistant attorney general during Nixon's first term, he had taken part in internal executive-branch discussions of the scope of executive privilege.}} Fifteen days later Nixon announced his decision to resign as president effective the next day, August 8, 1974. Many legal experts outside of the United States were shocked at how legal process, particularly one issued at the request of a subordinate official, could require the head of state to do anything. Cox wrote of one scholar who said: "It is ''unthinkable'' that the courts of any country should issue an order to its Chief of State."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Archibald|title=The Court and the Constitution|page=7|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1987|isbn=0395379334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox spent much of the rest of his career writing on the unique place of the Court in the American system of government. As for this particular case, when it was all over, ''Times'' legal correspondent Anthony Lewis gave chief credit for the extraordinary result to Cox: 
{{Quote|text=If Cox and his staff had not been so able and dogged, they easily could have fallen in a dozen procedural holes along the way in the tapes case. …But plainly there was more to that Saturday night and its aftermath. It all depended on public attitudes—and they in turn depended on the public's reading of one man's character. I am convinced myself that the character of Archibald Cox was essential to the result. Nixon and his men never understood it; they assumed that Cox must be a conspirator, like them, when he was so straight as to approach naivete. [Cox said on taking the job]: "I think sometimes it is effective not to be nasty, in a nasty world—although it may take a little while for people to realize that."&lt;ref name="LewisTrib"/&gt;}}

==After Watergate==

===Teaching again===
Cox spent the academic year from September 1974 to Spring 1975 at the University of Cambridge as the [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]].{{efn|The professorship had been offered before Cox's appointment as Watergate prosecutor. Cox chose to deliver lectures at [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex College]].{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=393–94}}}} During that year Cox and his wife were able to travel throughout Britain and Ireland meeting judges, lawyers and other dignitaries. Cox lectured to packed houses, including at Oxford where he delivered the [[Chichele Lectures]] at [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]]. The Coxes also occasionally socialized with the Richardsons, Elliot having been appointed by President [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] as the Ambassador to the [[Court of St James's]]. They were even able to spend a weekend in Scotland with David Graham-Campbell, the commander of corps that Cox's brother Robert served in when he died during World War II.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=394}}

When Cox returned to Harvard in the Fall of 1975 he returned to teaching and writing full-time. His interests were now almost exclusively constitutional law, but he occasionally would teach a course in labor law. Faculty members and students noticed a change in his style of teaching. Whereas once he was known as the austere, dominating law professor drilling students with the [[Socratic method]], and even was considered a possible basis for the fictional [[The Paper Chase (novel)|Professor Kingsfield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hlrec60&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=1&amp;id=38|last=Sisson|first=Frank E.|title=Paper Chase Finally Comes Home|work=Harvard Law Record|volume=60|number=3|date=February 14, 1975|page=6|accessdate=May 1, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was now referred to in student evaluations as "interesting, kind, decent." Derek Bok concluded: "He developed an affection for people."{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=397}}

===Judicial reform===
Cox's outside activities shifted from arbitration to government reform and appellate advocacy. In 1975, court reform was a top priority in Massachusetts where criminal cases had backlogged the system, which (because they required priority) resulted in even greater congestion of civil cases. Cox was appointed to a Massachusetts Bar committee to study the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.barjournals/malr0060&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=303&amp;id=338|last=Wadsworth|first=Charles Y.|title=President's Message: Judicial Reform!|work=Massachusetts Law Quarterly|volume=60|number=4|date=December 1975|page=336|accessdate=May 1, 2016}} Subscription required.)&lt;/ref&gt; in February 1976 Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] appointed Cox to head the 20 member Governor's Select Committee on Judicial Needs to make recommendations. In December the committee issued the Cox-drafted report, entitled "Report on the State of the Massachusetts Court."&lt;ref&gt;Cox himself summarized the report in {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.barjournals/malr0062&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=189#&amp;id=23|last=Cox|first=Archibald|title=The Report of the Governor's Committee on Judicial Needs|work=Massachusetts Law Quarterly|volume=62|number=1|date=March 1977|pages=23–28|accessdate=April 2, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Report's most important recommendations were a structuring of the District Courts, state assumption of the administrative costs of the courts, placing management of the court system in the hands of the chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, abolition of trials ''de novo'' in appeals from the District Court and tightening of the rules for remand and continuances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/hlrec63&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=310&amp;id=149|last=Jordan|first=Charles|title=Cox Judiciary Committee Nixes Trial De Novo, Reworks Budget|work=Harvard Law Record|volume=63|number=10|date=December 16, 1976|pages=1, 4| accessdate=May 1, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that the Governor made judicial reform along the lines of the Cox report his "top" legislative priority for 1976, and despite the fact that the proposal was supported by the newspapers of the state, and despite intense lobbying efforts by Cox himself (not only in testimony before the legislatures but also in numerous speaking events throughout the state) over the course of 1976, the legislation ultimately ran out of time in the 1977 legislative session.{{efn|The recommendations faced an uphill battle through Massachusetts byzantine politics. The major problems were (i) the balkanized judicial system gave hundreds of independent enclaves of patronage, so the judiciary (including clerks and other officers) had no interest in reform; (ii) there existed a "terrible hatred" between the Governor and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee (both of whom supported reform, and the chairmen and between the Senate and House Judiciary Committees (the later of which opposed reform); and (iii) the House kept inserting poison pills that would make the legislation unconstitutional (namely, making certain judges elected rather than appointed) and reusing to include a [[Severability|severability provision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5141774/obstacles_to_judicial_reform_in/|last=Swaim|first=Loring|title=Court Reform Faces Uncertain Future in House|work=Lowell [Mass.] Sun|date=November 27, 1977|page=E1|accessdate=May 2, 2016|via=newspapers.com}} The continuation is on [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5141820/obstacles_to_judicial_reform_in/ page E2].&lt;/ref&gt; Late in the legislative season Cox tried to persuade the state's selectmen at an annual gathering that the bill would substantially ease their own budgets and benefit local governments especially,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/55018160/?terms=archibald%2Bcox%2Bjudicial%2Breform#|last=Bird|first=Joan|title=Cox Puts Case for Reform Before State's Selectmen's Assn.|work=Berkshire [Mass.] Eagle|date=October 29, 1977|page=11|accessdate=May 2, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the association ignored the plea in its legislative requests.

===Supreme Court advocate===
Just as his public support for Udall was uncharacteristic, after Watergate Cox was more open to represent groups not a part of traditional institutions.{{efn|For example, in early 1977 Cox agreed to help an advocacy group for native Americans who were pressing the claims of the [[Passamaquoddy]] and [[Penobscot]] against the state of Maine for land acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5143301/cox_advises_passamquoddy_and_penobscot/|title=Cox Joins Legal Team for Indians|work=Portsmouth [N.H.] Herald|date=February 2, 1977|page=2|accessdate=May 2, 2016|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claims were ultimately settled for $81.5 million through the adoption of the [[Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton|Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/nativevoices/timeline/550.html|title=Maine Indians settle land claims against U.S.|publisher=National Institutes of Health, Health &amp; Human Services|date=n.d.|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} But Cox's chief interest was always in Supreme Court advocacy. And he would argue two more landmark cases.

The first of the cases arose out of the 1974 amendments&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 93-443, {{usstat|88|1263}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Federal Election Campaign Act|Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]]. These amendments were a response to the campaign finance abuses of Nixon's [[Committee for the Re-Election of the President]], which Cox was familiar with as Special Watergate Prosecutor.{{efn|The president's counsel, Herb Kalmbach, was able to raise large and illegal contribution from numerous corporations and commercial groups, and following the contributions the contributors received significant government benefits: The Milk Producers Association pledged $2 million at the same time the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]] increased the support price of milk. American Airlines received approval for certain profitable routes right after an illegal contribution. ITT agreed to underwrite the Republican National Convention and an antitrust suit by the government was dropped after a direct order by the president to Richard Kleindienst.{{sfn|Cox|1982|p=397}}}} The amendments provided for financial reporting by federal campaigns, established a variety of contribution and spending limitations and provided for public funding of presidential campaigns. A variety of plaintiffs sued, claiming the regulatory scheme violated their right to free speech. In 1975 the case reached the Supreme Court, and Senators Edward Kennedy and Hugh Scott requested Cox to file an ''amicus'' brief on their behalf. [[Common Cause]] had intervened as a party in the lower court and therefore had time a right to argue before the Court, but its counsel [[Lloyd Cutler]] disagreed with the position taken by the organization (which supported the amendments) and Cox was asked to argue on its behalf.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=e01  &amp; 553 n. 34}}

Cox's key argument was that the contribution of money, even when done to enable public discourse is not "speech" but rather "conduct." Nor was total campaign spending, even though part of it was used to enable "speech." In light of the realities of escalating campaign contributions, Congress had a right to regulate this conduct to reduce corruption and to counter public cynicism in the electoral process. Cox argued that such conduct should be subject to a lesser standard of court review than the strict scrutiny of restrictions on pure political speech. The Court's decision in the case, known as ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|424|1|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a bizarre array of separate opinions on various parts of the amendments, with only a brief ''per curiam'' decision tallying the votes on each issue.{{efn|The principal regulations were as follows: (i) prohibition on individuals against contributing more than $1,000 to any one candidate per election; (ii) prohibition on multi-candidate committees against contributing more than $5,000 to one candidate; (iii) prohibition on candidates against contributing above set ceilings from personal or family funds; (iv) prohibition on aggregate spending by a campaign above a set amount; (v) prohibition on individual against spending above $1,000 on behalf of a candidate regardless whether it was in coordination with the campaign; (vi) provision for federal financing of campaign under certain conditions, including that candidate agrees to spending limits; (vii) prohibition on "election committee" against spending more than $1,000 on any candidate who has elected public financing. The Court held that (i) the reporting requirements were constitutional; (ii) the restrictions on contributions were constitutional; (iii) restrictions on spending by the campaign or individuals (except those in coordination with a campaign that accepted the voluntary restrictions as a condition for public financing) were unconstitutional; and (iv) the provisions for public financing of presidential elections were constitutional.{{sfn|Cox|1982|pp=397–98}}}} The Court rejected Cox's approach. As Justice White put it in dissent, the Court held that 'money talks" without considering the variety of ways that federal laws regulate speech in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;424 U.S. 257, 262-64 (White, J., dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while it voided limits on campaign spending, it upheld contribution limits, financial reporting requirements and the conditions to financing of presidential campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion of the details of ''Buckley v. Valeo'', ''see'' {{harvnb|Cox|1982|pp=404–415}}; {{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ylr103&amp;start_page=469&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=8&amp;men_tab=srchresults#&amp;id=483|last=Levit|first=Kenneth J.|title=Campaign Finance Reform and the Return of Buckley v.

Gardner]], the chairman of Common Cause called it a victory for those who "worked so hard to clean up politics in this country."{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=401}}

The second significant case Cox participated in dealt with affirmative action. In 1976 the California Supreme Court had ruled that the University of California–Davis Medical School had violated the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by failing to admit Allan Bakke, a 37-year-old white engineering student, who claimed that he was barred by a "racial quota." The trustees sought out Cox to argue the case in the Supreme Court,  Cox who had already prepared a brief on the issue in the ''DeFunis'' case, agreed to take the case on the condition that other lawyers take primary responsibility for preparing the brief, something highly unusual for Cox who normally carefully supervised and revised anything that went to the Court under his name, but necessary because of the work involved on the Massachusetts court reform committee{{sfn|Gormley|1997|pp=401–02}} When the case came on to be argued, on October 12, 1977, Cox was in the midst of his heaviest schedule of lobbying for the reform bill with the legislative session over after the holidays. The crux of his argument was to separate two questions facing universities who had fewer places available than qualified candidates: 1) Which candidates are capable of benefiting from the education provided by the school? and 2) From that group what characteristics can the school employ to make up a class benefits each other, the school and the community. It is the confusing of the two questions that gives rise to the claim that a "quota" exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?men_tab=srchresults&amp;handle=hein.journals/natblj3&amp;size=2&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=15#&amp;id=251|last=Simmons|first=Vikki|title=Friends of the Court|work=Black Law Journal|volume=3|number=3|pages=245–248, 246|accessdate=May 2, 2016|via=[[Heinonline.org]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox opened his ''Bakke'' argument by stating these questions in an elegant way that put the case at its most forceful; namely, that unless the Court permitted universities to take race into account to promote minority participation in learned professions, they would be excluded except for a very small number.{{efn|Cox opened by stating the case as follows:{{Quote|text="This case … presents a single, vital question: whether a state university, which is forced by limited resources to select a relatively small number of students from a much larger number of well-qualified applicants, is free, voluntarily, to take into account the fact that a qualified applicant is black, Chicano, Asian, or native American, in order to increase the number of qualified members of those minority groups trained for the educated professions and participating in them, professions from which minorities were long excluded because of generations of pervasive racial discrimination."{{sfn|Ogeltree|2004|p=16}}}}}} The case, known as ''[[Regents of the University of California v. Bakke]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|438|265|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced several opinions: four justices opined that taking race into account was never permissible; four, on the other hand, that it was permissible if "benign." Justice [[Lewis F. Powell Jr.|Lewis Powell]], whose plurality opinion, joined in by the different groups in different parts, tried to thread the needle. While he rejected a fixed number of acceptances (a so-called "quota"), and thus affirmed Bakke's admission in this case, he also answered Cox's framing of the question in the affirmative and said that universities are entitled to take race into account as one factor among many.&lt;ref&gt;438 U.S. at 315-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Assistant Attorney General [[Drew S. Days, III]], who watched the argument felt that Cox's presence was crucial as a symbol of the "establishment" assuring the Court (and the conservative Justice Powell) that the position was not "outlandish."&lt;ref name="Gormley 1997 405"&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|p=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's approach opinion underlies the approach of most university affirmative actions policies today.{{efn|There was much debate whether Powell's opinion on race as a permissible "plus factor," represented a holding of the Court inasmuch as it was not joined in by other justices. That doubt was removed by ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', 539 U.S. 306 (2003), where Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] re-affirmed Justice Powell's reasoning in an opinion for the Court. Cox's friend and colleague Charles Ogeltree attributes the survival of affirmative action programs in universities to Cox's forceful argument in ''Bakke''.{{sfn|Ogeltree|2004|pp=17–18}}}}

===Judicial politics===
In late 1978 a new seat became available in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (the federal appellate court sitting in Boston) when Congress expanded the federal judiciary by 152 judges. Observers expected Senator Kennedy to avail himself of the tradition allowing the Senator of the president's political party to name federal judges in his state to propose Archibald Cox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/28/archives/kennedy-proposes-a-black-man-and-a-jewish-woman-as-judges-two.html|last=Knight|first=Michael|title=Kennedy Proposes a Black Man and a Jewish Woman as Judges|work=New York Times|date=November 28, 1978|page=A16|accessdate=May 3, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1979 a panel of lawyers appointed by President Carter unanimously recommended Cox as their first choice among five for the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gormley|1997|pp=407–08}}. ''See also'' {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/04/archives/cox-is-candidate-far-judgeship-on-the-federal-court-of-appeals.html|title=Cox is Candidate for Judgeship on the Federal Court of Appeals|work=New York Times|date=March 4, 1979|page=29|accessdate=May 3, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox was highly doubtful, however, that Carter would appoint him in light of his prominent support of Udall three years earlier, but nevertheless filled out the application and submitted to background checks.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=408}} Then in June the ''New York Times'' reported that the nomination was "stalled." Some anonymous sources claimed that Attorney General [[Griffin B. Bell]] objected to the nomination on the ground that Cox at 67 was too old, noting that the ABA suggested that no one over 64 be named to the job. Another suggested that behind this rationale was antagonisms between Bell and Cox dating back to when Cox was Solicitor General and Bell was an appellate court judge in the south. Another source said that the Justice Department was holding up the appointment because Kennedy was attempting to assert undue influence as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who had the ability to block appointments across the country. Publicly, however, all the parties insisted that the delay was nothing out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/03/archives/coxs-nomination-to-bench-stalled-by-3way-battle-viewed-as-major.html|title=Cox's Nomination to Bench Stalled by 3-Way Battle|work=New York Times|date=June 3, 1978|p=26|accessdate=May 3, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the White House Cox had his defenders who argued strongly against the "rule of 64" and even obtained an opinion that the ABA would not object to Cox's appointment. Kennedy even spoke personally to Carter, urging that the appointment would redound to the president's political benefit, but Carter told him he would not appoint Cox. When the decision was made members of Carter's own judicial selection publicly expressed their anger over the decision.{{efn|One member said that "[i]t bothers me ... because he ... disregarded what the commission was trying to do—select the positively best person." Common Cause's counsel termed the behavior "awfully petty." The ''National Journal'' concluded the affair demonstrated that when Carter and his aides "bungle something, they don't do it half way." It showed lack of statesmanship and competence at a time when Carter's hold on the nomination, let alone re-election, was slipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Richard E.|title=Another White House Folly|work=National Journal|volume=11|number=6|date=September 8, 1979|page=1492}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Carter's 1976 New York campaign manager listed the failure to appoint Cox as one of several ways in which the Administration had "behaved foolishly" simply to snub Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/13/archives/move-grows-at-capitol-to-urge-carter-to-shun-race-talk-of-visit-to.html|last=Clymer|first=Adam|title=Move Grows at Capitol to Urge Carter to Shun Race|work=New York Times|date=September 13, 1979|page=B18|accessdate=May 4, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year another panel assembled by Carter asked Cox if he wished again to apply for a judgeship. Cox quickly turned down offer of interest. His colleague [[Stephen Breyer]] obtained the appointment.{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=411}}

===Common Cause===
His judicial ambitions over, Cox turned his energies to leading outside advocacy and policy-making groups. In 1980 Cox was elected chairman of [[Common Cause]], the 230,000 member citizens' lobby, as John Gardner's successor. Cox wrote that "[t]he challenge was to reshape the machinery of self-government … so that every citizen knows that he or she can participate and that his or her participation counts ... ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/03/archives/archibald-cox-is-elected-to-head-common-cause.html|title=Archibald Cox is Elected to Head Common Cause|work=New York Times|date=February 3, 1980|page=15|accessdate=March 11, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year he also became the founding chairman of the [[Health Effects Institute]], a partnership between the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and private automobile and truck manufacturers to study the effects of emissions from motor vehicles. Cox said that the organization was designed to take the testing and scientific research concerning the health effects of this type of pollution "out of the adversarial context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/12/13/archives/health-institute-to-study-motor-vehicle-emissions-concern-over.html|last=Shabecoff|first=Philip|title=Health Institute to Study Motor Vehicle Emissions|work=New York Times|date=December 13, 1980|page=8|accessdate=March 11, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was as head of Common Cause, however, that he was to make his final mark; his goal was to make government more transparent and responsible to the broad public rather than special interests in order to restore faith in government institutions. The very day he took office, the [[Abscam]] affair was leaked. While Cox personally deplored the leak, he immediately sent letters to congressional leaders underlining "the urgent necessity of looking into the charges to demonstrate that Congress is concerned about its honor and integrity."&lt;ref name=CSMSatNight/&gt; In July 1980 the organization instituted its first major litigation under Cox, and it was a follow-up on ''Buckley v. Valeo'': Common Cause sued the four "independent" groups that promised to spend between $38 and $58 million for television and print advertisements in support of the election of [[Ronald Reagan]], even though he agreed to abide by spending limits of $29.4 million as part of the agreement he made in accepting public financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806EEDB1139F931A35754C0A966948260|last=Weaver|first=Warren, Jr.|title=Group Supporting Reagan is Sued|work=New York Times|date=July 2, 1980|page=A17|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-to-work law|Right to work groups]] used the occasion to criticize Cox for attacking voluntary independent expenditures while ignoring union efforts on behalf of candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/07/29/archives/on-straining-out-the-flies-and-swallowing-the-camel.html|last=Larson|first=Reed|title=On Straining Out the Flies and Swallowing the Camel|work=New York Times|date=July 29, 1980|page=A15|accessdate=May 4, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The D.C. District Court dismissed the case on the ground that any restrictions on "independent" spending amounted to an unconstitutional abridgment of freedom of speech.

Conservatives' complaints against Common Cause became more general and more numerous from that summer to fall when the organization celebrated its tenth anniversary. [[Henry Fairlie]] published in the June issue of ''Harper's'' a broad (but largely unspecific) complaint against the organization for representing all that was wrong with American politics: "The underlying thrust of Common Cause reforms has been to weaken the political role of the very associations that give power to the otherwise powerless, and in the name of this misguided notion of participatory democracy Common Cause increases the opportunities of the already influential to extend their privileges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://harpers.org/archive/1980/06/constitutional-complaints/|last=Fairley|first=Henry|title=Constitutional Complaints; What Ails America|work=Harper's|volume=240|number=1561|date=June 1980|pages=27–30, 32–34, 36, 29|accessdate=May 4, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Bethell (Washington editor of Harper's) wrote in the ''Times'' " The concept of 'reform' itself is beginning to be viewed with skepticism. Writers are more and more inclined to put the word inside quotation marks. In Washington these days, one often hears references to 'the unintended consequences of reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/08/24/archives/taking-hard-look-at-common-cause.html|last=Bethell|first=Tom|title=Taking a Hard Look at Common Cause|work=New York Times|date=August 24, 1980|page=A34|accessdate=May 4, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox responded in an address on September 6, 1980: It was not reforms that were the problem, but rather incomplete implementation of them. The flood of money into national political campaigns was not the result of campaign finance reform, but of inadequate regulation of "independent" committees that informally coordinated with the campaigns. "[D]amaging and dangerous as the rising rate of influence of political action committee contributions is … the present law is clearly preferable to the old pre-Watergate conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/09/07/archives/common-cause-marks-birthday-with-new-resolve-misguided-notion-of.html|last=Herbers|first=John|title=Common Cause Marks Birthday with New Resolve|work=New York Times|date=September 7, 1980|page=36|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox continued his campaign against large campaign contributions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenbag.org/v1n3/v1n3_dialogue_cox_gossett.pdf/ |title=The Case for Campaign Finance Reform |author=Archibald Cox |website=[[The Green Bag]] |language=en-US |access-date=2018-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161023213040/http://www.greenbag.org/v1n3/v1n3_dialogue_cox_gossett.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;‘‘See’’ e.g.’’, {{cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1037925060?|last=Merry|first=George B.|title=PAC Foes Seek to Cap Dollars for Candidates|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=July 15, 1983|accessdate=May 6, 2016|subscription=yes|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was largely unsuccessful in effecting any further change.

After twelve years at the helm, Cox, at 79, chose to retire from the chairmanship of Common Cause as of February 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/15/style/chronicle-078091.html|last=Anderson|first=Susan Heller|title=Chronicle|work=New York Times|date=May 15, 1991|page=B4|accessdate=May 10, 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
Having taught for two years beyond Harvard's mandatory retirement age, Cox was finally forced to retire from the Harvard Law School faculty at the end of the 1983-84 school year. Cox wryly said: "I won't be allowed to teach anymore. I'm presumed to be senile." He then accepted a teaching position at [[Boston University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/19/us/the-nation-archibald-cox-to-leave-harvard-law-faculty.html|author=UPI wire service|title=Archibald Cox to Leave Harvard Law Faculty|work=New York Times|date=April 19, 1984|page=A16|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boston University Law School made up a specific retirement policy for Cox; according to Dean Ronald A. Cass: "He teaches as long as he wants to."{{sfn|Gormley|1997|p=556 n.105}}

==Death==
Cox died at his home in [[Brooksville, Maine]], of [[natural causes]] on May 29, 2004.  He and his wife, Phyllis, had been married for 67 years. At the time of his death his daughter Sarah (in business management) lived in Brooksville, Archibald, Jr. (who broke with family tradition and entered finance rather than law) in Markleville, Indiana and Phyllis (who became a lawyer) in Denver. At the time he had several grandchildren and great grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/02/classified/paid-notice-deaths-cox-archibald.html|title=Paid Notice: Deaths Cox, Archibald|work=New York Times|date=June 2, 2004|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phyllis died on February 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020700354_pf.html|last=AP wire service|title=Phyllis Ames Cox|work=Washington Post|date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashrama''' is a [[Retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] located in the Upper San Antonio Valley in [[Diablo Range (census county division)|unincorporated]] [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], [[California]], United States. It is approximately 40 miles east of downtown [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

== History ==

The retreat resides on {{convert|160|acre}} of [[California Oak Woodland|oak-studded]] [[chaparral]] [[scrubland]] near Upper San Antonio Valley Road, about 18 miles southeast of [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]].  The land was gifted to the [[Vedanta Society]] at the turn of the 20th century, as a place for meditation and contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sfvedanta.org/the-society/history/shanti-ashrama-history/ Vedanta Historical Society of Northern California, Shanti Ashrama History]&lt;/ref&gt;  A meditation cabin there serves as the site for annual retreats.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sfvedanta.org/the-society/history/shanti-ashrama-historical-overview/ Vedanta Historical Society of Northern California, Shanti Ashrama Meditation Cabin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://sfvedanta.org/shanti-ashrama-retreat-photos/ Vedanta Historical Society of Northern California, Shanti Ashrama Annual Retreats]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio therapy''' is the clinical use of recorded [[sound]], [[music]], or [[Speech|spoken]] [[words]], or a combination thereof, recorded on a physical medium such as a [[compact disc]] (CD), or a [[Computer file|digital file]], including those formatted as [[MP3]], which patients or participants play on a suitable device, and to which they listen with intent to experience a subsequent beneficial [[Physiology|physiological]], [[Psychology|psychological]], or [[Social relation|social]] effect.

==Synthesis of multiple disciplines==

Audio therapy synthesises elements from a number of discrete areas of research and practice, including [[Music therapy|receptive music therapy]], [[bibliotherapy]], [[creative visualization]], [[guided imagery]], [[guided meditation]], [[sound healing]], and [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Blenkiron, P., Coping with depression: A pilot study to assess the efficacy of a self-help  audio cassette. British Journal of General Practice, Vol. 51, 2001, pp366-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suresh, B. S., De Oliveira Jr, G. S., and Suresh, S., The effect of audio therapy to treat postoperative pain in children undergoing major surgery: a randomized controlled trial. Pediatric surgery international, Vol. 31, No. 2, 2015, pp197-201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, R. M., Taylor, O., Shah, S., and Urstein, S., A Prospective, Randomized Trial in the Emergency Department of Suggestive Audio-Therapy under Deep Sedation for Smoking Cessation. Western Journal of Emergency Medicine, Vol. 8, No. 3, 2007, p79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaini, N., Latip, M. F. A., Omar, H., Mazalan, L., and Norhazman, H., Online personalized audio therapy recommender based on community ratings. In Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics (ISCAIE), IEEE Symposium, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Receptive music therapy===
{{main|Music therapy}}

The term "receptive music therapy" denotes a process by which patients or participants listen to music with specific intent to therapeutically benefit; and is a term used by therapists to distinguish it from "active music therapy" by which patients or participants engage in producing [[Human voice|vocal]] or [[Musical instrument|instrumental]] music.&lt;ref name="Bruscia, K. 1998"&gt;Bruscia, K. (1998). Defining music therapy. Gilsum, NH: Barcelona.&lt;/ref&gt;

Receptive music therapy is an effective adjunctive [[Mind–body interventions|intervention]] suitable for treating a range of [[Human body|physical]] and [[Mind|mental]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Grocke, D., and Wigram, T. (2007). Receptive methods in music therapy: Techniques and clinical applications for music therapy clinicians, educators, and students. London, England: Jessica Kingsley, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio therapy inherits from receptive music therapy the process by which listening to sound benefits a listener, but departs from it in three significant ways.

Firstly, whilst receptive music therapy provides musical sound, to which the patient or participant listens, audio therapy also uses other kinds of acoustic content, including the [[Speech|spoken word]] and [[Ambient music|ambient]] [[Background noise|noise]].&lt;ref&gt;Kämpfe, J., Sedlmeier, P., and Renkewitz, F., The impact of background music on adult listeners: A meta-analysis. Psychology of Music, Vol. 39, No. 4, 2011,  pp424-448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, practitioners of receptive music therapy allege that its effective application requires the presence of a therapist, emphasizing the relationship between the client and the therapist, between the client and the music, and between the client and therapist interacting with the music. In contrast and by distinction, audio therapy is provided as a self-service modality, through which the listener is purported to experience a therapeutic benefit in consequence to listening, without input or guidance form a third party.&lt;ref name="Bruscia, K. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris, C. 2012"&gt;Morris, C., The use of self-service technologies in stress management: A pilot project. Master of Social Work Clinical Research Papers. Saint Catherine University, St. Paul, MN, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter, E. 2006, pp27-39"&gt;Carter, E., Pre-packaged guided imagery for stress reduction: Initial results. Counselling, Psychotherapy and Health, Vol. 2, No. 2, 2006, pp27-39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naik, M. N. S. 2013"&gt;Naik, M. N. S., Effect of guided imagery on life style among alcoholics. Sinhgad e-Journal of Nursing, Vol. 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, whilst receptive music therapy may provide live as well as recorded music, to which the patient or participant listens, audio therapy is always provided via a [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, J. A., An examination of effectiveness of a sleep induction audiotape in conjunction with a standardized behavioral treatment protocol on anxiety, depression, psychosocial functioning, and sleep among a clinical population with insomnia. Doctoral Dissertation, Florida State University, Tallahassee. FL, USA, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bibliotherapy===
{{main|Bibliotherapy}}

[[Bibliotherapy]] is the process by which a patient or participant reads [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and other creative with intent to experience a therapeutic outcome that manifests most commonly as the relief of [[psychological pain]] or mental distress as well as an increased [[Introspection|introspective]] insight into himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;Lehr, F., Bibliotherapy. Journal of Reading, Vol. 25, No. 1, 1981, pp76-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, G., Hevey, D., &amp; Martin, E., Patients' and providers' perspectives on bibliotherapy in primary care. Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Vol. 17, 2010, pp497-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bibliotherapy is often situated in a context where it is one of multiple interventions, and is usually grounded in a specific psychotherapeutic or psychological discipline. One such discipline is [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, L. F., and Smith, T. P., Integrating self-help into psychotherapy. Journal of Clinical Psychology In Session, Vol. 59, 2003, pp177–186.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike music therapy, but similar to audio therapy, the most important aspect of cognitive bibliotherapy is the content of the recording, and not the individual interactions with a therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Cuijpers, P., Donker, T., van Straten, A., Li, J., and Andersson, G., Is guided self-help as effective as face-to-face psychotherapy for depression and anxiety disorders? A systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative outcome studies. Psychological Medicine, Vol. 40, No. 12, 2010, pp1943-1957.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio therapy imports the principles of bibliotherapy but provides the content on a recorded media, making therapeutic use of [[audiobook]]s&lt;ref&gt;Scogin, F., Hamblin, D., &amp; Beutler, L., Bibliotherapy for depressed older adults: A self- help alternative. The Gerontologist, Vol 27, 1987 pp383–387.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creative visualization===
{{main|Creative visualization}}

Creative visualization is the [[Cognition|cognitive]] process of [[Intention|purposefully]] generating [[Visual perception|visual]] [[mental image]]ry, with eyes open or closed,&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, A. R., and Marks, D. F. (1994). Individual differences in mental imagery experience: Developmental changes and specialization.

Creative visualization can be facilitated in person by a teacher or practitioner, or provided on recorded media. Whether provided in person, or delivered via [[Digital media|media]], as it is in audio therapy the [[Speech|verbal]] instruction consists of words, often pre-scripted, intended to direct the participant's [[Attentional control|attention]] to [[intention]]ally generated [[Visual perception|visual]] [[mental images]] that precipitate a positive psychologic and physiologic response, incorporating increased [[Relaxation (psychology)|mental]] and [[Relaxation technique|physical]] relaxation and decreased [[Stress (psychological)|mental]] and [[Stress (biology)|physical]] stress.&lt;ref&gt;Lang P.

===Guided meditation===
{{main|Guided meditation}}

Guided meditation is a process by which one or more participants [[Meditation|meditate]] in response to the guidance provided by a trained practitioner or teacher,&lt;ref name="Online Version"/&gt; either in person or via a written text, sound recording, video, or [[audiovisual]] [[Digital media|media]]&lt;ref name="Morris, C. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter, E. 2006, pp27-39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein, T.

London, England: Jessica Kingsley, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio therapy facilitates guided meditation for therapeutic benefit through the provision of recordings.

The term "guided meditation" is most commonly used in [[Medicine#Clinical practice|clinical practice]], scholarly research, and [[Scientific method|scientific investigation]] to signify an aggregate of integrated techniques. The most common and frequently used combination or synthesis comprises meditation music and [[Music therapy|receptive music therapy]], [[guided imagery]], [[Relaxation technique|relaxation]], some form of [[Meditation|meditative practice]], and [[Writing therapy|journaling]]. Less commonly, [[hypnosis]], or [[Hypnotherapy|hypnotherapeutic procedures]] are included as part of the multifaceted intervention denoted by the term "guided meditation".&lt;ref&gt;Astin, J.A., Shapiro, S.L., Eisenberg, D.

===Cognitive behavioral therapy===
{{Main|Cognitive behavioral therapy}}

New York, NY: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that can be delivered effectively to a range of patients through the provision of audio recordings, as it is in audio therapy, which provide the patient with instruction pertaining to the management of [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[behavior]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Seidler, G.

The British Journal of Psychiatry Vol. 183, 2003, pp57–65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypotheses ==

Audio therapy is predicated on the hypothesis that attentively listening to recorded sound, such as music, spoken words, or [[ambient noise]], affects [[thought]]s and feelings, which in turn affects [[brain]] [[electrochemistry]] and [[Human body|body]] [[physiology]]. It may therefore be considered as a [[Mind–body interventions|mind-body intervention]], as defined by the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] (NCCIH). The NCCIH defines mind–body interventions as those practices that "employ a variety of techniques designed to facilitate the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms", and include [[guided imagery]], [[guided meditation]] and forms of [[Meditation|meditative activity]], [[hypnosis]] and [[hypnotherapy]], [[prayer]], as well as [[art therapy]], [[music therapy]], and [[dance therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Straus, S. E., Expanding Horizons of Healthcare: Five Year Strategic Plan 2001–2005. 25 September 2000. US Department of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service. National Institutes of Health. NIH Publication No. 01-5001. [https://nccih.nih.gov/sites/nccam.nih.gov/files/about/plans/fiveyear/fiveyear.pdf Online Version] Retrieved 31 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the means by which the mind affects the body is largely unknown, it is explained to a significant degree by [[psychoneuroimmunology]].

The term "psychoneuroimmunology" was coined by the American psychologist [[Robert Ader]] in 1981 to describe the study of interactions between psychological, [[Neurology|neurological]], and immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ader, R., A historical account of conditioned immunobiologic responses. In R. Ader (Ed.), Psvchoneuroimmunology, pp321-352. New York: Academic Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental hypothesis of psychoneuroimmunology is concisely that the way people think and how they feel directly influences the [[electrochemistry]] of the brain and [[central nervous system]], which in turn has a significant influence on the [[immune system]] and its capacity to defend the body against [[Disease#Terminology|disease]] [[infection]], and ill health. Meanwhile, the immune system affects [[brain]] [[chemistry]] and its electrical activity, which in turn has a considerable effect on the way we think and feel.&lt;ref&gt;Borysenko, J., Psychoneuroimmunology: behavioral factors and the immune response. ReVision, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1984, pp56-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this interplay, a person's negative thoughts, feelings, and perceptions, such as pessimistic predictions about the future, regretful ruminations upon the past, low self-esteem, and depleted belief in self-determination and a capacity to cope can undermine the efficiency of the immune system, increasing vulnerability to ill health. Simultaneously, the biochemical indicators of ill health monitored by the immune system feeds back to the brain via the nervous system, which exacerbates thoughts and feelings of a negative nature. That is to say, we feel and think of ourselves as unwell, which contributes to physical conditions of ill health, which in turn cause us to feel and think of ourselves as unwell.&lt;ref&gt;Borysenko, J., Minding the Body, Mending the Mind. MA: Addison-Wesley, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the interplay between cognitive and emotional, neurological, and immunological processes also provides for the possibility of positively influencing the body and enhancing physical health by changing the way we think and feel. For example, people who are able to deconstruct the cognitive distortions that precipitate perpetual pessimism and hopelessness and further develop the capacity to perceive themselves as having a significant degree of self-determination and capacity to cope are more likely to avoid and recover from ill health more quickly than those who remain engaged in negative thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, E., The Psychobioloqy of Mind-Body Healing. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, Inc., 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barbagian Code''' can be called a ''code of behavior'' not written that prevailed not only in the [[Barbagia]], the Sardinian historical region referred to, but in all the municipalities of province of [[Nuoro]] and [[Province of Ogliastra|Ogliastra]], in those of [[Goceano]] (province of [[Sassari]]) and in some high Oristanese.

== Features ==
This is a kind of code of honor, similar to a parallel justice, which has sometimes replaced legal organs of the territory. Some scholars believe that behind the creation of the ''Code'' there is the lack of protection of the individual from the state, which in the years in question was not present in the territory.

This situation of a stateless motivated the bloody actions of criminal organizations of the 20th century and ruled the wires of the same organization [[Sardinian Kidnappings Anonima]] in the 1960s.

According to research by [[Antoinetta Mazzette]], professor at the University of [[Sassari]], conducted in 2006 in this area takes place most of the bloody events of the island. Although the population is very small, this area corresponds to that in which it developed, from 18th century, the so-called "classic banditry".

Much of the code is and defines the ''injuries suffered'', by the personal insult, theft and murder, and penalties; the socio-economic environment in which this process has been developed is to agro-pastoral. The purpose is to protect the honor and the dignity of the individual.

== Example ==
In case an individual suffers a theft of cattle, it will not be theft in itself to constitute damage, but the intrinsic meaning to which was targeted crime: in this case the loss of the family self-subsistence ''offense''. The latter will have the right to vengeance, which must be proportionate to the damage suffered. As regards the side of the strictly economic loss, the individual offended commit in turn a theft of cattle to return to a ''situation of equality''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3911">'''Boris Andreevich Grushin''' ({{lang-ru| Бори́с Андре́евич Гру́шин}}; 2 August 1929, Moscow – 18 September 2007, Moscow) was a well-known [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Russians|Russian]] [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]] and [[historical]] and [[sociological]] [[scientist]]. He is generally seen as the pioneer of public opinion polling in the [[Soviet Union]] more than thirty years before its breakup. Prominent American novelist [[Olga Grushin]] is his daughter.

==Life and scientific activity==
Grushin graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]] in 1952 with a dissertation on ''The Logical and Historical Problem in Marx's Capital''. In 1957 he completed his postgraduate study in the same place, with a thesis on ''Receptions and Ways of Reproducing the Thoughts of Historical Development''.

At the same time in 1952 Grushin was one of the founders of the Moscow Logic Circle. Other members who entered the circle included [[Aleksandr Zinovyev]], [[Merab Mamardashvili]] and Georgy Schedrovitsky. It was later called the Moscow Methodological Circle (ММК).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fondgp.org/mmc The Moscow Methodological Circle]". The Schedrovitsky Institute for Development. Retrieved 2009-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 he founded the Institute of Public Opinion at the newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' where problems within the Soviet Union were brought to daylight and analyzed through public opinion surveys for the very first time.

In 1967 Grushin received a [[doctorate]] in [[philosophy]] from the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union for his work concerning the ''Problem of Methodology while Researching Public Opinion''. He decided to leave the newspaper work afterwards and devoted himself to several different projects.

Between 1962–1965 and 1977–1981 Grushin was an employee of the journal ''[[Problems of Peace and Socialism]]'' in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. In the years of 1967–1968 and 1982–1989 he worked at the [[MSU Faculty of Journalism|Faculty of Journalism]] of the Lomonosov [[Moscow State University]].

In the two years from 1988 to 1990 he was one of the organizers and directors of the [[VCIOM|All-Soviet Center for Public Opinion Studies]] (VCIOM), which gave him the chance to expand his work on public opinion surveys.

Meanwhile in 1989, Grushin created the Service of studying of public opinion Vox Populi the first detached and completely private opinion center in the Soviet Union.

Between all his projects Grushin worked at several academic centers such as the Institute of Sociological Researches and the [[Central Economic Mathematical Institute]]. He taught at different universities in Russia and the USA and in 1993 worked as one of the advisers of president [[Boris Yeltsin]].

In 2003 Grushin received the award of the Union of Russian Journalists for "journalistic skills" in his book ''Four Lives of Russia''.

Grushin died on September 18, 2007 in [[Moscow]].

Long after his death Boris Grushin will be remembered as one of the founding fathers of Russian [[sociology]] who firmly worked towards the recognition for sociology as a scientific discipline. Some of his pupils and followers include J. Kapeljush, V. Sazonov, T. Dridze, A. Zhavoronkov, A. Vozmitel, V.Korobejnikov, E. Andrjushchenko, V. Tokarovsky, E. Avraamova, L. Byzov and many more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

It was during his term when the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|first set]] of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]] was promulgated on 23 March 1956 where the [[nation-state]] was declared as [[Islamic republic|Islamic Republic]] with a [[Parliamentary form of government|parliamentary form]].&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al.

Despite his feat, Prime Minister Muhammad Ali proved to be a poor politician who failed to maintain [[Control (sociology)|control]] over his [[Pakistan Muslim League|party]] when he reached a compromise to dismissed the cabinet members of his own party in favor of appointing the cabinet composing of [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican Party]] and [[Awami League]] in 1955-56.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al, 2003 (Muhammad Ali Becomes Prime Minister)" /&gt; After appointing [[Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan|Abdul Jabbar Khan]] as the [[Chief Minister of Pakistan|Chief minister of West-Pakistan]] who subsequently helped in [[Vote trading|secret trading]] in favor of Republican Party that made the [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republicans]] in [[majority]] in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]], the [[Pakistan Muslim League|Muslim League]] demanded its president to investigate the matter but Prime Minister Ali refused to support the [[Resolution (law)|parliamentary resolution]] in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] by believing that "he was responsible only to the [[Cabinet of Pakistan|Cabinet]] and the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]], not the party."&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al, 2003 (Muhammad Ali Becomes Prime Minister)" /&gt;

On 8 September 1956, the parliamentary leaders of the [[Pakistan Muslim League|Muslim League]] under [[Abdul Qayyum Khan|A.Q. Khan]], successfully brought the [[motion of no confidence]] at the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] that effectively removed him from the party's presidency.&lt;ref name="Nazaria-i-Pakistan Trust, et.al, 2003 (Muhammad Ali Becomes Prime Minister)" /&gt; Despite support from the [[Republican Party (Pakistan)|Republican Party]] and [[Iskandar Mirza|President Mirza]], Prime Minister Ali eventually resigned from the [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Office]] of [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] of Pakistan when [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Huseyn S. Suhrawardy]] had gained support from the Muslim League for the premiership.{{rp|9-10}}&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO, Lyon, 2008" /&gt; 

After his resignation, Ali went to [[Corporate sector of Pakistan|corporate sector]] and joined the [[National Bank of Pakistan|National Bank]] as an economist but tried playing a role in [[Politics of Pakistan|national politics]] in 1960s but was [[Ostracism|ostracized]] by the Muslim League due to his political role played in 1950s.{{rp|9-10}}&lt;ref name="ABC-CLIO, Lyon, 2008" /&gt; 

His son, [[Khalid Anwer]], is a well-known lawyer and constitutional expert, who served as the [[Law Minister of Pakistan|Law and Justice minister]] in Sharif's administrations while his younger son is Dr. Amjad Ahsan Ali is well known [[Physician|medical doctor]].

The '''Chinvat Bridge''' [ʧinva:t]&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; ([[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''Cinvatô Peretûm'', "bridge of judgement" or "beam-shaped bridge")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/pf/pf21.htm|title=Paradise Found: Part Fourth: Chapter V. The Cradle of the Race in Iranian, or Old-Persian, Thought|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Bridge of the Requiter'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions | author = Merriam-Webster, Inc. | editor = Doniger, W. | publisher = Merriam-Webster | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780877790440 | page = 421}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Zoroastrianism]] is the sifting [[bridge]]&lt;ref name="Dawson2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Ethical Religion of Zoroaster | last = Dawson | first = M. M. | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780766191365 | page = 237}}&lt;/ref&gt; which separates the world of the living from the world of the dead.  All [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s must cross the bridge upon death. The bridge is guarded by two four-eyed dogs. A related myth is that of [[Yama]], the Hindu ruler of Hell who watches the gates of Hell with his two four-eyed dogs.

The Bridge's appearance varies depending on the observer's [[asha]], or righteousness. As related in the text known as the [[Bundahishn]], if a person has been wicked, the bridge will appear narrow and the demon '''Vizaresh''' will emerge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/bund24.html#chap28|title=The Bundahishn ("Creation"), or Knowledge from the Zand: chapters 24-28|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drag their soul into the '''druj-demana''' (the House of Lies), a place of eternal punishment and suffering similar to the concept of [[Hell]].&lt;ref name="heritageinstitute.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/death/index.htm#chinvat|title=Page 1. Zoroastrianism After Life. Zoroastrian Funeral Customs &amp; Death Ceremonies|first=Ed|last=Eduljee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a person's good thoughts, words and deeds in life are many, the bridge will be wide enough to cross, and the [[Daena]], a spirit representing revelation, will appear and lead the soul into the '''House of Song'''. Those souls that successfully cross the bridge are united with [[Ahura Mazda]].
Often, the Chinvat Bridge is identified with the rainbow, or with the Milky Way galaxy, such as in Professor C.P. Tiele's "History of Religion ".&lt;ref&gt;Tiele, C.P. ''History of Religion''. London and Boston, 1877: p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars such as C.F. Keary and Ferdinand Justi disagree with this interpretation, citing descriptions of the Chinvat Bridge as straight upward, rather than curvilinear.&lt;ref&gt;C. F. Keary, ''Primitive Belief''. Lond., 1882: p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, ''The Seven Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World: Parthia and Sassania''. Gorgias Press LLC, 2002. {{ISBN|1-931956-47-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three divinities are thought to be guardians of the Chinvat Bridge: [[Sraosha]] (Conscience), [[Mithra]] (Covenant) and [[Rashnu]] (Justice).&lt;ref name="heritageinstitute.com"/&gt;

Alternate names for this bridge include '''Chinwad''', '''Cinvat''', '''Chinvar''' or '''Chinavat'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avesta.org/zglos.html#Glos_C|title=Glossary of Zoroastrian terms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the Chinvat bridge is similar to that of the [[As-Sirāt]] in [[Islam]].

==In scripture==
In the 71st chapter of the Avestan text, the [[Yasna]], there is a description of the Chinvat Bridge.

==In literature==
[[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s second part of the trilogy Poena Damni [[With the People from the Bridge]] alludes to the Chinvat Bridge. In the book a bridge functions as part of the setting of a makeshift performance but also as a narrative element that connects the world of the living with the world of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exercisebowler.com/issue21.htm|title=Exercise Bowler Issue 21|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet Charles Olson references the Chinvat Bridge ("Cinvat" in his reading) in his epic, The Maximus Poems; a work which deals with Avestan mythology, among numerous others.

==Features==
The Crazyflie 2.0 is a palm sized [[quadcopter]] weighing 27 grams supporting wireless control over radio and [[Bluetooth_Low_Energy|Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)]]. It has a flight time of 7 minutes and a charge time of 40. As an open source project, its code and design specifications are available to anyone and the design was created with modification in mind. It's extensible with additional boards called "decks" - similar to [[Arduino]] shields - that are connected through two rows of pin headers.

==Decks==

The following decks are currently available:

* LED-ring deck
* [[Qi_(standard)|Qi]] wireless charging deck
* SD-card deck
* Prototyping deck
* BigQuad deck
* Breakout deck
* Buzzer deck
* Loco positioning deck
* Z-ranger deck
* Flow deck

==Development==
The Crazyflie firmware is written in C++ and based on [[FreeRTOS]]. On the client side several languages can be used including Python&lt;ref name="bitcraze2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:api:python:index|publisher=wiki.bitcraze.io|title=doc:crazyflie:api:python:index &amp;#91;Bitcraze Wiki&amp;#93;|accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, C++, C#, Ruby, NodeJS, Scala, Java and Ada/SPARK.&lt;ref name="electronicdesign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicdesign.com/dev-tools/adaspark-fixes-crazyflie-nano-quadrotor-0|publisher=electronicdesign.com|title=Ada/SPARK Fixes Crazyflie Nano Quadrotor &amp;#124; Dev Tools content from Electronic Design|accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also mobile clients for iOS and Android &lt;ref name="bitcraze3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:dev:env:android|publisher=wiki.bitcraze.io|title=doc:crazyflie:dev:env:android &amp;#91;Bitcraze Wiki&amp;#93;|accessdate=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41844">A '''cross-sex friendship''' is a [[platonic relationship]] between an unrelated [[men|man]] and [[women|woman]]. There are multiple types of cross-sex [[friendships]], all defined by whether or not each party has a romantic [[Attractiveness|attraction]] to each other, or perceives that the other is interested. A few theories have been developed to explain the existence of such friendships. Research has been done on why men and women initiate these relationships, how they are perceived by others, implications for children with cross-sex friendships, among others. Cross-sex friendships can also create problems for those involved if either or both have or ever had any romantic feelings for the other.

==Background==

From the 20th century and onwards, cross-sex friendships have become more prevalent, especially in the [[United States]]. These relationships play a large role in [[social relation]]s of both men and women. Cross-sex relationships can often be a cause of complications because of the potential for [[Romance (love)|romance]] or sexual interactions.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228351895_Relational_maintenance_in_cross-sex_friendships_characterized_by_different_types_of_romantic_intent_An_exploratory_study|title=Relational maintenance in cross-sex friendships characterized by different types of romantic intent: An exploratory study|author=Laura K. Guerrero|date=1 November 2005|work=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsour (2002) defines a cross-sex friendship as a “voluntary, non-familial, non-romantic, relationship between a female and a male in which both individuals label their association as a friendship”.&lt;ref name=monsour2002&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1021394929086|title=Book Review: Women and Men as Friends: Relationships Across the Life Span in the 21st Century. Michael Monsour, Mahwah, NJ, Erlbaum (Series on Personal Relationships); 2002. 277 pp. ISBN 0-8058-3567-9. $27.50 (softcover) | doi=10.1023/A:1021394929086 | volume=47|journal=Sex Roles|pages=295–296|author=Bookwala Jamila|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just because these friendships are labeled as “non-romantic,” one cannot assume that there are no romantic or sexual undertones.

Guerrero and Chavez (2005) suggest that there are four types of cross-sex friendships: mutual romance, strictly platonic, desires romance, and rejects romance.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005/&gt; In a “mutual romance” cross-sex friendship, one of the participants wants a romantic relationship with the other individual and believes that the other individual wants the same. In “strictly platonic” relationships, the individual believes that the other simply wants to be just platonic friends with no thought of romance. In a "desires romance" cross-sex friendship, one individual wants the friendship to become a romantic relationship but does not believe the other individual wants a romantic relationship. In a “rejects romance” cross-sex relationship, one individual does not want the relationship to turn romantic, but believes that their friend does.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005/&gt; Each of these friendship styles are based on the goals and viewpoint of the individual. Other theories and research discuss the causes and benefits of cross-sex friendships.

==Major theories==

===Evolutionary theory===

Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) theorize that cross-sex friendships are a part of humans’ evolved [[Human mating strategies|mating strategies]]. Current mating strategies unconsciously motivate individuals to enter into cross-sex friendships because it gives them more opportunities to mate. As a result, individuals within these cross-sex friendships often develop attraction to the other individual, even when that attraction is completely unintended.&lt;ref name=bleske2012&gt;Bleske-Rechek, April et al. [http://bleske-rechek.com/April%20Website%20Files/Bleske-Rechek%20et%20al.%202012%20Benefit%20or%20Burden.pdf "Benefit or Burden? Attraction in cross-sex Friendship"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[evolutionary theory]] predicts that cross-sex friendships are formed by males for sexual access and by females for protection.&lt;ref name="bleske2001"&gt;Bleske-Rechek, A. L. &amp; Buss, D. M.[http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/group/busslab/pdffiles/opposite_sex_friendship2001.pdf "Opposite-Sex Friendship: Sex Differences and Similarities in Initiation, Selection, and Dissolution"], "[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]", 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates one way in which cross-sex friendships serve, in part, as a long term mating acquisition strategy. Having more opportunities to mate is an evolutionary advantage, however, being attracted to a cross-sex friend creates negative social consequences. This is especially true for younger adults who are attracted to a cross-sex friend, because these people report less satisfaction in their current romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt; Also, middle-aged adults tend to nominate attraction to their cross-sex friends as more of a negative than a positive.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt;

===Social learning theory===

In addition, [[social learning theory]] predicts that if cross-sex friendships are a result of the desire for sexual access and protection, this is because they are imitating other cross-sex friendships. Most popular television shows and movies suggest that the goal of forming cross-sex friendships is a romantic relationship. People learn from the friendships they see in [[popular culture]] and model their behavior after them.

Preference for same sex relationships is a societal norm that is taught to children from a young age. This homosocial norm encourages same sex friendships early on that shape how adolescents view and measure cross-sex friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Suzanna M.|title=Same- and cross-sex friendships and the psychology of homosociality|journal=Sex Roles|date=1985|volume=12|issue=1–2|doi=10.1007/bf00288037}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally supported rules about friendships and gender influence the formation of interpersonal relationships. For this reason, ideas of cross-sex friendship can vary from place to place. While diverse cultures view relationships across genders differently, studies have shown that similar ideals for friendship seem to exist around the world in areas such as the United States, Europe, and East Asia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felmlee|first1=Diane|last2=Sweet|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Sinclair|first3=H. Colleen|title=Gender Rules: Same- and Cross-Gender Friendships Norms|journal=Sex Roles|date=2012|volume=66|issue=7–8|pages=518–529|doi=10.1007/s11199-011-0109-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, adolescent definitions of cross-sex friendships closely match definitions given by adults, suggesting that children develop perceptions on the matter by imitating the opinions of adults in their lives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connolly|first1=Jennifer|last2=Craig|first2=Wendy|last3=Goldberg|first3=Adele|last4=Pepler|first4=Debra|title=Conceptions of Cross-Sex Friendships and Romantic Relationships in Early Adolescence|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=1999|volume=28|issue=4|pages=481–494|doi=10.1023/a:1021669024820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During adolescence, a distinction starts to form between romantic relationships and platonic friendships, which is influenced by personal experience as well as exposure to media and popular culture. Teenagers learn from portrayals of romance on television and base their own relationships on these representations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Popular media romanticizes and sexualizes interactions between people of opposite sexes, leading to a cultural expectation of sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships. This common conception leads a small percentage of the population to believe that men and women cannot exist in solely platonic friendships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The glass partition===

Kim Elsesser and Letitia Anne Peplau found that the professional workplace environment and heightened [[sexual harassment]] awareness can hinder cross-sex friendship formation.&lt;ref name="citeseerx.ist.psu.edu"&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The barrier between men and women forming cross-sex friendships in the professional workplace is called the "glass partition" because of its similarities to the [[glass ceiling]], which prevents women from reaching the top levels of leadership of corporations. The glass partition disadvantages women who work in predominantly male workplaces because women have fewer opportunities for networking. The glass partition results from fearing that friendliness toward a cross-sex friend will be misinterpreted by the friend and by co-workers as romantic or sexual interest, that humor may be perceived as sexual harassment by cross-sex friends, and that conversational topics might be perceived as offensive by cross-sex friends.&lt;ref name="citeseerx.ist.psu.edu"/&gt;

When coworkers or other third parties see a cross-sex friendship in the workplace as romantic, this relationship is often viewed negatively, hurting both the male and female worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoke|first1=Haley|title=Throwing Stones At The Glass Partition: Responses To Coworkers Cross-Sex Workplace Friendships|journal=European Journal of Management|date=2015|volume=15|issue=2|pages=85–96|doi=10.18374/ejm-15-2.5|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rebecca_Chory/publication/282588300_Throwing_stones_at_the_glass_partition_Responses_to_coworkers'_cross-sex_workplace_friendships/links/5787c1b808aedc252a9368ad.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern becomes specifically prevalent when dealing with cross-sex friendships between superiors and subordinates. It is more likely that this relationship can be misconstrued as often the subordinate, usually a female, might be seen as trying to make advances in order to further their career.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsesser|first1=Kim|last2=Peplau|first2=Anne|title=The glass partition: Obstacles to cross-sex friendships at work|journal=Human Relations|date=2006|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1077–1100|doi=10.1177/0018726706068783|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual harassment can hinder the development of cross-sex friendships as well. It is typical practice in companies and organizations to have policies against sexual harassment and to conduct trainings regarding sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winstead|first1=BA|title=Gender and relationships at Work|journal=Friends and Enemies in Organizations|date=2009|pages=139–167|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37468344/Enemies_and_Friends_in_Organisation.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1510091424&amp;Signature=3oy2mRUJLQK2PkvpxdSRgRjLoEM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRelational_Atmospheres_-_Organisational.pdf#page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this heightened awareness of sexual harassment occurrences, many individuals will step back from cross-sex friendships as they can sometimes be misinterpreted by the opposite sex individual or bystanders as sexual harassment. In the study conducted by Elsesser and Peplau, it was stated that most men interviewed in their study often think over conversation topics before initiating conversation with women coworkers, in fear that their comments would be misinterpreted as sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsesser|first1=Kim|last2=Peplau|first2=Anne|title=The glass partition: Obstacles to cross-sex friendships at work|date=August 2006|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1077–1100|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|doi=10.1177/0018726706068783|journal=Human Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cases of such wrong accusations, many would rather avoid the possibility of such a situation through avoiding the development of cross-sex friendships as opposed to deal with the possible misconceptions.

Furthermore, it has been reported that oftentimes for men, there is a fear of offending the opposite sex regarding certain conversation topics. For instance, a male management consultant interviewed by Elsesser and Peplau stated that he commonly segregates by gender what type of jokes or humor he expresses in the workplace in fear that it might offend a female coworker.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; On the contrary, women often say that while they do not feel as though they censor their conversation as much, they can often sense such reservations and unwillingness to relax in men, making friendships awkward and harder to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsesser|first1=Kim|last2=Peplau|first2=Anne|title=The glass partition: Obstacles to cross-sex friendships at work|journal=Human relations|date=2006|volume=59|issue=8|pages=1077–1100|doi=10.1177/0018726706068783|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.489.7712&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fear to create cross-sex friendships in the workplace becomes a problem as friendships amongst coworkers can be specifically important for career development. Friendships can provide information access, networking and emotional support to any individual all of which are valuable for job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kram|first1=Kathy|last2=Lynne|first2=Isabella|title=Mentoring Alternatives: The Role Of Peer Relationships In Career Development|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=1985|volume=28|issue=1|pages=110–132|doi=10.2307/256064|url=http://sq4ya5rf2q.scholar.serialssolutions.com/?sid=google&amp;auinit=KE&amp;aulast=Kram&amp;atitle=Mentoring+alternatives:+The+role+of+peer+relationships+in+career+development&amp;id=doi:10.2307/256064&amp;title=Proceedings+-+Academy+of+Management&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=1&amp;date=1985&amp;spage=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, when one is limited to forming friendships with those of the same sex, certainly, they are being deprived of advancement in the workplace. Thus, effort should be put into creating workplace environments where cross-sex friendships can be formed with less question or fear.

==Major empirical findings==

Research has been done in the areas of attraction, protection, perception, cross-sex friendships throughout development, and touch and sexual activity between cross-sex friends. These studies find that there are some evolutionary and social benefits to cross-sex friendships. However, there are also some negative social consequences.

===Attraction===

Within cross-sex friendships, men judge sexual attraction and the desire for sex as a more important reason than do women for initiating their friendship. Additionally, men are more sexually attracted to their opposite-sex friends and have more frequent desires to have sexual intercourse with their opposite-sex friends than women are.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) found that men overestimate how much their female friends are attracted to them. Women are less likely to want to date their male friends if he is in a committed relationship, but men have the same desire to date their female friend whether or not she is dating someone.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt; Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) hypothesize that a man’s desire to date his female friend is not changed by whether or not their female friend is in a relationship. This is due to males’ mating strategies that focus around acquiring short term mates.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt; Furthermore, Bleske-Rechek et al. (2012) suggest that men would pursue cross-sex relationships both when single and in a relationship, while women would be less likely to pursue cross-sex friends while dating someone.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt;

Attraction within these friendships can cause challenges. Sexual attraction can arise for a variety of reasons in cross-sex friendships. In a study by Halatsis and Christakis (2009), participants cited social pressures and emotional vulnerability as reasons for sexual attraction arising in a cross-sex friendship.&lt;ref name=halatsis&gt;Halatsis, P. &amp; Christakis, N. [http://spr.sagepub.com/content/26/6-7/919.abstract "The challenge of sexual attraction within heterosexual's cross-sex friendship"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A social pressure that may prompt sexual attraction between cross-sex friends is the perceptions other friends have of their relationship and emotional vulnerability coupled with closeness may provoke sexual attraction between cross-sex friends. When sexual attraction develops in a friendship, it can corrupt the friendship and individuals state that behavior often changes. Sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships is often dealt with in one of three ways: management of this attraction through communication or an internal decision not to pursue the attraction in order to preserve the friendship, a sexual relationship forms then dissipates, or sex becomes a part of the friendship.&lt;ref name=halatsis/&gt; When participants in the study by Halatsis and Christakis (2009) were asked about their experience with sexual attraction in cross-sex friendships, over 50% had experienced attraction, and over 50% of that group had expressed or acted on their sexual attraction. However, men had a tendency to be more attracted to their cross-sex friends, and a higher tendency to act on that attraction. Only 16% of individuals who had acted on their sexual attraction claimed that their friendship ended as a result, otherwise the friendship remained intact or transformed into a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=halatsis/&gt;  
Reeder (2000) found that there are four types of attraction within cross-sex friendships: subjective physical/sexual attraction, objective physical/sexual attraction, romantic attraction, and friendship attraction.&lt;ref name=reeder2000&gt;Reeder, H. [https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/85933/jspr-reeder.pdf "I like you...as a friend: The role of attraction in cross-sex friendship"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Subjective physical/sexual attraction occurs when one of the individuals in the friendship is physically attracted to the other. Objective physical/sexual attraction happens when one individual thinks that the other is attractive in general, yet they are not attracted to the person. Romantic attraction within the cross-sex friendship occurs when one of the individuals within the friendship desires to turn the friendship into a romantic relationship because they believe he or she would make a good girlfriend or boyfriend. Friendship attraction is simply when an individual feels very platonically connected to his or her friend.&lt;ref name=reeder2000/&gt; The four types can coexist together within a friendship or can occur separately. Furthermore, the type of attraction that an individual feels within a cross-sex friendship can change over time. Within Reeder’s (2000) sample, friendship attraction is the most prevalent type of attraction within cross-sex friendships. Even when participants felt other types of attraction within their cross-sex friendships, they prioritized their friendship attraction so that they relationship would not be ruined.&lt;ref name=reeder2000/&gt;

===Protection===

Historically, women are more vulnerable due to their smaller stature and lesser strength compared with men. Thus, women have consistently needed to secure protection for themselves.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Seeking protection from men would have been an evolutionary advantage as women who do so increase their reproductive success, which has caused an evolved preference for men who are willing and able to offer protection.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Therefore, it is not surprising that Bleske-Rechek &amp; Buss (2001) found that women judged physical protection as a more important reason for initiating an opposite-sex friendship than did men and that opposite-sex friendship is a strategy women use for gaining physical protection.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt;

In this regard, males have historically been perceived as having an advantage in cross-sex friendships because the number of resources they have to offer in the relationship exceeds those of females (Monsour et al. 57).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In terms of exchange principles within the friendship, women would benefit more than men (Monsour et al. 57).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While women may enter into cross-sex friendships for protection, men may enter them for the possibility of sexual encounters (Akbulut and Weger 100).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akbulut|first=Valerie|last2=Jr|first2=Harry Weger|date=2016-01-02|title=Predicting Responses to Bids for Sexual and Romantic Escalation in Cross-Sex Friendships|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00224545.2015.1066296|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=156|issue=1|pages=98–114|doi=10.1080/00224545.2015.1066296|issn=0022-4545|pmid=26133674}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interactions are desirable because men get to spread their genes through potential offspring (Akbulut and Weger 100).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In return, females can benefit from this type of cross-sex friendship through their friend’s interest in potential offspring (Akbulut and Weger 101).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this regard, the men within these cross-sex friendships would devote time and energy to caring for and protecting their potential children, which would be beneficial to the females in these relationships (Akbulut and Weger 101).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, in cross-sex friendships, it has been discovered that males are commonly the ones more interested in initiating romantic relationships due to their potential benefits, as observed in a survey of male and female college students (Akbulut and Weger 110).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Perception===

The way in which other individuals perceive cross-sex friends can affect the friendship itself. Cross-sex friends sometimes face the audience challenge within their [[social group]]s, which occurs when other people assume that they are in a romantic or sexual relationship and the cross-sex friends have to present themselves as just friends in response.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014&gt;Schoonover, K. and McEwan, B. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12040/abstract, "Are you really just friends? Predicting the audience challenge in cross-sex friendships"], "[[Personal Relationships]]", 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Schoonover and McEwan (2014) state that since male-female romantic relationships are the norm, people often assume that cross-sex friendships have the potential to develop into a more intimate relationship.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; The different types of cross-sex friendships will experience the audience challenge in different ways. Strictly platonic friends are least likely to bring about the audience challenge, while mutual romance are the most likely to face the audience challenge.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; The number of cross-sex friends an individual has also plays a role in how their cross-sex friendships are perceived. When an individual has numerous cross-sex friendships, they are much less likely to face the audience challenge.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt;

Regardless of the severity of the audience challenge, those in cross-sex friendships have been found to spend a considerable amount of time thinking about how their relationship is perceived by others, according to the results of a study that surveyed young adults in cross-sex friendships (Schoonover and McEwan 399).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; If the peers within their social network of friends want or believe that the cross-sex friendship is romantic, issues could potentially arise in other relationships (Schoonover and McEwan 389).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; For example, if either member of the friendship has a romantic partner, that person could become jealous or suspicious, which could create tension and destroy the cross-sex friendship (Schoonover and McEwan 389).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; Therefore, the surrounding social network’s opinions of the cross-sex friendship can change the degree that the friends have to worry about the audience challenge (Schoonover and McEwan 391).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; In other words, as the network’s support of the cross-sex friendship as a strictly platonic relationship increases, the audience challenge decreases (Schoonover and McEwan 401).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; However, while the audience challenge can be a problematic issue for certain types of cross-sex friendships, it has found to not be commonly experienced within cross-sex friendships at large (Schoonover and McEwan 394).&lt;ref name="schoonover2014" /&gt; One of the main attributes to this finding was that members of the cross-sex friendships were able to effectively communicate with each other as well as their social network about the nature of their relationship and how they were being perceived (Monsour et al. 75).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monsour|first=Michael|last2=Harris|first2=Bridgid|date=July 1994|title=Challenges Confronting Cross-Sex Friendships: "Much Ado about Nothing?"|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=31|pages=55–77|via=|doi=10.1007/bf01560277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children’s and adolescent’s cross-sex friendships===

Cross-sex friendships in [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]] often have an immense impact on adult cross-sex friendships. Successfully forming cross-sex friendships in childhood is often an indication that these individuals will be able to form positive cross-sex friendships later in life. Thus, early cross-sex friendships act as a blueprint for further social interactions.&lt;ref name=monsour2002/&gt; Children’s [[social skills]] and [[behavior]] can be altered based on whether or not they have predominantly same-sex friends or cross-sex friends. One study by Kovacs, Parker, and Hoffman (1996), they found that children who primarily had friends of the opposite sex were perceived to be more aggressive, yet less shy by others.&lt;ref name=kovacs1996&gt;Kovacs, D. M., Parker, J. G., &amp; Hoffman, L. W. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9022241 "Behavioral, Affective, and Social Correlates of Involvement in Cross‐Sex Friendship in Elementary School"], "[[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]]", 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, teachers said that the children with primarily friends of the opposite sex had lower academic performance and social skills, however faced less stereotyping in regards to gender roles and were better adjusted to their social atmosphere than children with few friends in general. Results from Kovacs, Parker, and Hoffman’s (1996) study show that children who have a best friend that is the opposite sex have poorer social functioning abilities. Yet, when children have friends primarily of the same sex, but some cross-sex friendships, they tend to be more well-adjusted and have stronger social skills.&lt;ref name=kovacs1996/&gt; Additional studies conducted by Bell and Kalmijn oppose these negative observations behind cross-sex friendships in children, concluding that cross-sex friendships help children overcome communication barriers with the opposite sex, granting them an advantage with their social and communication skills later on. Their studies also observed that cross-sex friendships in children incorporate stronger senses of nurturance and intimacy that lack in same-sex friendships.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1981 in Traustadottir, 2004, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-sex friendships in adolescence are very different than in childhood. In adolescence, cross-sex friendships are not only more accepted by peers, but also can increase an individual's social status among same-sex peers.&lt;ref name=winstead1997&gt;Winstead, B. A., Derlega, V. J., &amp; Rose, S. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1993.tb01165.x/abstract "Gender and Close Relationships: An Introduction"], "[[Journal of Social Issues]]", 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on adolescents in 6th through 8th grade conducted by Malow-Iroff (2006) discovered that adolescents often use the creation of cross-sex friends as a road to popularity because children with both cross-sex and same-sex friends are more accepted by both sexes.&lt;ref name=malow2006&gt;Malow-Iroff, M. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16916075 "cross-sex Best Friendship Influences on Early Adolescent Cigarette and Alcohol Expectancies and Use"], "[[The Journal of Psychology]]", 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents mainly look for cross-sex friends who are sociable, as they expect less from these friendships as they do from same-sex friends.&lt;ref name=winstead1997/&gt; Another study by Ami Flam Kuttler, Annette M. La Greca, and Mitchell J Prinstein surveyed 223 students from grades 10 through 12. The study concluded that although the number of cross-sex friendships in adolescents increase with age, both girls and boys felt a sense of stronger companionship and prosocial support with their friends of the same sex. However, adolescent boys claimed they felt as if their female companions provide support in regards to [[self-esteem]] more so than males. In addition to these findings, the study concluded that adolescents with predominately cross-sex friendships at these ages is perceived in relation to a lower social acceptance, rather than attaining to social or behavioral complications as observed in children through middle childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glickman | first1 = Alissa R. | last2 = La Greca | first2 = Annette M. | year = 2004 | title = The Dating Anxiety Scale for Adolescents: Scale Development and Associations With Adolescent Functioning | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Child &amp; Adolescent Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 566–578 | doi=10.1207/s15374424jccp3303_14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Touch and sexual activity in cross-sex friendships===

In cross-sex friendships, Miller, Denes, Diaz, and Ranjit (2014) found that when men believe the friendship to be strictly platonic, they are more open to touching their friend. However, when they think intimacy may be increasing in the relationship, they are less like to desire casual touching.&lt;ref name=miller2014&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pere.12033/abstract|title=Touch attitudes in cross-sex friendships: We're just friends | doi=10.1111/pere.12033 | volume=21|journal=Personal Relationships|pages=309–323|author=Miller Michael J|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the opposite was discovered to be true when it comes to women. Miller et al. (2014), found that women report being more uncomfortable if touched by their cross-sex friend in a public situation than men did.&lt;ref name=miller2014/&gt; When there is touch between cross-sex friends, no matter how much intimacy is involved in the friendship, men tend to be more aroused by the touch than women are.&lt;ref name=miller2014/&gt; The researchers hypothesize that the research results may have been confounded by a [[social desirability bias]] because women may be less likely to admit arousal from the touch of a cross-sex friend out of fear of being negatively labeled by others.&lt;ref name=miller2014/&gt;

Afifi and Faulkner (2000) investigated instances in which individuals had sexual interactions with their platonic cross-sex friends. 51% of their sample had sex with their friend when they had no intention of pursuing a romantic relationship with them, and 34% of participants noted having sexual relations with their friend on multiple occasions.&lt;ref name=afifi2000&gt;Afifi, W. &amp; Faulkner, S. [http://spr.sagepub.com/content/17/2/205.short "On Being 'Just Friends': The Frequency and Impact of Sexual Activity in cross-sex Friendships"], "[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]", 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Afifi &amp; Faulkner’s study, of those who had sex with their friend, two-thirds stated that it improved their relationship and 56% stated that the relationship did not develop into something romantic.&lt;ref name=afifi2000/&gt;

Sexual interactions are recognized as a possible outcome of cross-sex friendships because societal expectations have conditioned males and females to view each other as potential sexual partners (Monsour et al. 56).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the face of these sexual overtones, some welcome the sexual tension in their cross-sex friendship while others note that the potential intimacy could destroy their relationship (Monsour et al. 57).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the sexual component, some friends are hesitant to enter into romantic relationships due to the anticipated disapproval of their social network of peers (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Cross-sex friends often have overlapping social circles (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each member in the cross-sex friendship depends on their social network for support and other emotional needs (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, potentially falling out of touch with members of one’s own social network if the romantic relationship did not work out, is too costly for some cross-sex friends, even if they have engaged in sexual interactions (Akbulut and Weger 109).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Nature/nurture==

The biological basis for cross-sex relationships cannot be found in ancient human history, because the way humans conducted their lives is different from the way current humans do now. Up until 10,000 years ago, or for over 99% of homo history, humans’ ancestors lived their lives in a nomadic fashion, foraging in groups structured by reproductive partners and offspring — not unlike the way families are organized current-day.&lt;ref name=chagnon1992&gt;http://www.saexplorers.org/system/files/magazine/sae-mag-43j-books.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Females began reproducing at an early age, and males practiced behaviors that showcased ownership over their female partners in order to safeguard them from other males. There have only been scattered ethnographic references to cross-sex friendships across cultures.&lt;ref name=bleske2001/&gt; Therefore, for much of ancient human history, cross-sex friendships were not common. Today, men and women interact in non-romantic, supportive ways in all types of contexts: work, sports, education, and hobbies, yet these unions are not based on  sexual intentions. Evolved mating strategies were mentioned earlier and can be dovetailed with this biological history.&lt;ref name=bleske2012/&gt;

==Controversies==

Participants in cross-sex friendships face many challenges, including learning how to navigate the particular type of friendship. The four types of cross-sex friendship as defined by Guerrero and Chavez (2005) referenced earlier are: strictly platonic, mutual romance, desires romance, and rejects romance.&lt;ref name=guerrero2005/&gt; In addition, O’Meara (1989) originally stated that the four essential challenges cross-sex friends face are: 1) determining the type of emotional bond experienced in the relationship, 2) confronting the issue of sexuality, 3) dealing with the issue of relationship equality within a cultural context of gender inequality, and 4) the challenge of public relationships — presenting the relationship as authentic to relevant audiences.&lt;ref name=omeara1989&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00289102#page-1|title=cross-sex friendship: Four basic challenges of an ignored relationship | doi=10.1007/BF00289102 | volume=21|journal=Sex Roles|pages=525–543|author=O'Meara J. Donald|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schnoonover (2014) built research upon O’Meara’s audience challenge and found that members of Guerrero and Chavez’s (2005) different friendship types may experience challenges differently.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; For example, for “mutual romance” couples, members may be approaching the preliminary romantic stage of the relationship and if their romantic feelings feed into their behaviors toward each other, then they will be the most likely to be mistaken for a romantic couple. In contrast, “strictly platonic” friends should be the least likely the prompt the audience challenge.&lt;ref name=schoonover2014/&gt; “Desires romance” and “rejects romance” couples may also be subject to the audience challenge — if observers of the friendship see the member acting in a romantic manner or admitting romantic intent, the observers might be more likely to regard the cross-sex friendship as a growing romantic relationship more so than a friendship.

Another controversial question surrounding cross-sex friendships that is often raised is - after two romantic partners end their relationship — or more colloquially, “break up” — can they still be platonic friends? Kenny and Schneider (2000) found three major conclusions about cross-sex friendship with a romantic history.&lt;ref name=kenny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spr.sagepub.com/content/17/3/451.abstract|title=cross-sex Friends Who were Once Romantic Partners: Are they Platonic Friends Now?|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, rebranding a discontinued romantic relationship as a friendship is common in modern American culture. Second, there are particular predictors of whether a friendship will occur after romance. One critical factor is whether there was a platonic friendship before the romantic relationship existed. Because the partners knew how to navigate friendship with each other before romance, they were more likely to be friends afterwards. Third, the atmosphere in which the breakup occurred determined the likelihood of a post-friendship.&lt;ref name=kenny/&gt; Kenny and Schneider (2000) cited evidence noting that a more significant indicator of an upcoming friendship is the communication in which the breakup occurred, not the individual who first initiated the breakup.&lt;ref name=kenny/&gt;

When looking at how men and women’s same sex relationships work, men tend to talk about more of their problems and open up more with women, rather than their other male friendships which tends to facilitate a bit of a gray area of what is expected when a man and a women are friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Apter|first1=Terri|title=Do Cross-Gender Friendships Always Have a Sexual Element?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/domestic-intelligence/200811/do-cross-gender-friendships-always-have-sexual-element|website=Psychology Today|publisher=HealthProfs|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-sex friendship can exist after marriage when the married couple transition out of the passionate phase. Original feelings while dating are feelings of passion and what many describe as love, however as the relationship progresses through the years and into marriage, studies have found these feelings to be diminished and transition into more of a friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Good|first1=Cassandra|title=Founding Friendships: Friendships between Men and Women in the Early Republic.|journal=The Journal of Social History|date=June 2017|volume=50|issue=4|pages=727–729|doi=10.1093/jsh/shw060|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jsh/shw060|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a topic of controversy as some argue it cannot be labeled as a cross sex “friendship” but rather a romantic relationship, however a study by Alan Booth and Elaine Hess (1974) dictates that almost all cross sex friendships can have some sexual/romantic influence, however it does not discount the friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Booth|first1=Alan|last2=Hess|first2=Elaine|title=Cross Sex Friendship|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=Feb 1974|volume=36|issue=1|pages=38–47|doi=10.2307/350992|jstor=350992}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The “friend zone” has also focused on the argument that two people of opposite sexes can never be friends, and many saying that no friendship can occur after one party has made it evident that they have romantic feelings for the other. This coincides with questions on if the parties involved can have had or currently have romantic feelings for one another, or if a friendship must be based on solely feelings of platonic friendship for the duration of the friendship. The definition of a cross-sex friendship that J. Donald O'Meara (1989) gives is a relationship between a man and a woman that is not primarily focused on romance, but is not always void of romantic feelings, meaning that once one party had been in the “friend zone” as long as the relationship is primarily aimed towards a friendship, it is still a cross-sex friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Meara|first1=Donald|title=Cross-sex friendship: Four basic challenges of an ignored relationship|journal=Journal of Research on Sex Roles|date=October 1989|volume=21|issue=7–8|pages=525–543|doi=10.1007/BF00289102|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00289102|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in child development psychology, more specifically a study done by Donna M. Kovacs, Jeffrey G. Parker and Lois W. Hoffman (1996) looked into children’s cross sex friendships, and found an absence of these types of friendships at younger ages. This raised cause for concern within the study as the researchers discussed how this could be due to a greater separation of genders at younger ages, which can reinforce societal defined gender roles, and prevent these types of friendships, which can be beneficial to development from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovacs|first1=Donna|last2=Parker|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Hoffman|first3=Lois|title=Behavioral, Affective, and Social Correlates of Involvement in Cross-Sex Friendship in Elementary School|journal=Society for Research in Child Development|date=October 1996|volume=67|issue=5|pages=2269–2286|doi=10.2307/1131622|jstor=1131622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has written influential books on intersectional feminism and founded Emory's Institute for the History of Philosophy. Willett was on the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s Executive Board between 2008 and 2010, and was recently the co-director of the [[Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy]]. She earned her Ph.D. in 1988 from [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.philosophy.emory.edu/facstaff/willett.shtml |title = Cynthia Willett |publisher = Emory University |accessdate = 19 January 2014 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140115190017/http://www.philosophy.emory.edu/facstaff/willett.shtml |archivedate = 15 January 2014 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
As an undergraduate at the University of Missouri at [[Columbia University]] (1974&amp;ndash;1977) and at the [[University of Minnesota at Minneapolis]] (1977&amp;ndash;1978), Willett studied political science. She then earned a master's degree in philosophy from the [[University of Toronto]] (1979&amp;ndash;1980). From 1981 to 1982 she did graduate work at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in philosophy and literature. She then moved to [[Pennsylvania State University]] to work toward a Ph.D. in philosophy, which she earned in 1988, with a dissertation titled ''Tropes of Orientation'' under the direction of Carl Vaught and Irene Harvey.

After serving as an assistant professor of philosophy at [[Le Moyne College]] from 1988 to 1991, she moved to the [[University of Kansas]] (1991&amp;ndash;1996) and then to [[Emory University]], first as an assistant professor and then, beginning in 1998, as an associate professor. She was promoted to the rank of full professor in 2004 and received an endowed chair in 2016.

==Research areas==
Willett specializes in ethics, social and political philosophy, critical theory, and American social thought of the 19th and 20th centuries.  She has researched and written about philosophy of music, literature, tragedy, comedy, and interspecies ethics.

==Publications==
Willett's first authored book was ''Maternal Ethics and Other Slave Moralities'', published by [[Routledge]] in 1995. In 2001 [[Cornell University Press]] published her book, ''The Soul of Justice: Social Bonds and Racial Hubris.''  Her 2009 book ''Irony in the Age of Empire'' was praised for its novel perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = A New Chapter in the Politics of Irony: Cynthia Willett’s Irony in the Age of Empire |first = Bill |last = Martin |journal = The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume = 24 |issue = 1 |date = 2010 |doi=10.1353/jsp.0.0094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = It Takes a Village Idiot: And Other Lessons Cynthia Willett Teaches Us |first = Andrew |last = Cutrofello |journal = The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume = 24 |issue = 1 |date = 2010 |pages = 85–95 |doi=10.1353/jsp.0.0095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her most recent book, ''Interspecies Ethics'', was published by [[Columbia University Press]], in August 2014.

'''Didymos''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Δίδυμος) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[Music theory|music theorist]] in the last century before the common era. He was a predecessor of Ptolemy at the library at [[Alexandria]].

== Theory ==
We know of his theory only indirectly from the works of Porphyry and Ptolemy. There one finds examples of his [[tetrachord]]s as measured string lengths from which the following proportions can be calculated:

* diatonic Tetrachord: 	(16:15)(10:9)(9:8)
* chromatic Tetrachord: (16:15)(25:24)(6:5)
* enharmonic Tetrachord:(32:31)(31:30)(5:4)

Like [[Archytas]] he used a major third, but appears to have been the first to use it in the diatonic as sum of the large and small whole tones as for the proportions (10:9)•(9:8)=5:4 obtains.The difference of these whole tones is the so-called syntonic comma, also referred to as Didymos' comma&lt;ref name="Contemplating-30"&gt;Page 30, Contemplating music: source readings in the aesthetics of music, Ruth Katz,Carl Dahlhaus.

'''Divided consciousness''' is a term coined by [[Ernest Hilgard]] to define a psychological state in which one's [[consciousness]] is split into distinct components, possibly during [[hypnosis]].

== Origin(s) ==
The theory of a division of consciousness was touched upon by [[Carl Jung]] in 1935 when he stated, "The so-called unity of consciousness is an illusion... we like to think that we are one but we are not."&lt;ref&gt;(Review: Dissociationism Revived, Matthew Hugh Erdelyi, Science, New Series, Vol. 200, No. 4342 (May 12, 1978), pp. 654-655; Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science)&lt;/ref&gt;  Ernest Hilgard believed that hypnosis causes a split in awareness and a vivid form of everyday mind splits.&lt;ref&gt;(Myers, David G. Psychology:  Eighth Edition in Modules. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;   Drawing themes from [[Pierre Janet]], Hilgard viewed hypnosis from this perspective as a willingness to divide the main systems of consciousness into different sectors.  He argued that this split in consciousness can not only help define the state of mind reached during hypnosis, but can also help to define a vast range of psychological issues such as [[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].

In Hilgard's ''Divided Consciousness Reconsidered'', he offers a great many examples of "[[dissociation (psychology)|dissociated]]" human behavior. With regard to theory, he does state that it is useful to assign two modes of consciousness, a receptive mode and an active mode—that is, a bimodal consciousness. In other places he mentions the concept of ''coconsciousness'', wherein two or more states of consciousness may be equally receptive or active, as, for example, in some types of multiple personality.&lt;ref&gt;Huebner, B. (1979). Distributing cognition: A defense of collective mentality,'' Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 8 (6)'',591;  Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/h66jn31642t052j8/fulltext.pdf?page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Many psychological studies assume a unity of consciousness. Doubt is cast on this assumption by psychophysical studies in normal subjects and those with [[blindsight]] showing the simultaneous dissociation of different modes of report of a sensation, and by clinical studies of [[anosognosia|anosognosic]] patients showing dissociations of awareness of their own states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} These and other phenomena are interpreted to imply two kinds of division of consciousness: the separation of phenomenal experience from reflexive consciousness and the non-unity of reflexive consciousness. Reflexive consciousness is taken to be necessary for report and is associated with the self as the subject of experience and agent of report. Reflexive consciousness is operative only when we attend to our own states. When we are involved in the world reflexivity intervenes less and our consciousness is more unified.&lt;ref&gt;Hebb, D, Juzyck, P, Klein R.,(1983). The Nature of Thought, '' Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, UK.'' Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=0cprqzSe6BkC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=By+Donald+Olding+Hebb,+Peter+W.+Jusczyk,+Raymond+M.+Klein&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=N_f-8zNr2K&amp;sig=dBHDyYyDKSCTQ4YohMjalD85fxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA32,M1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimentation ==
The theory has been tried and tested and some tests have proven that the theory makes some legitimate predictions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}  Others, such as one performed on 169 undergraduate students, some of whom performed tasks in [[selective attention]] and divided attention conditions being correlated with scores on the [[Hypnotic susceptibility#Harvard Group Scale|Harvard Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility]] refute Hilgard’s findings.&lt;ref&gt;Some operationalizations of the neodissociation concept and their relationship to [[hypnotic susceptibility]]. Stava, Lawrence J.; Jaffa, Melvyn. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Vol 54(6), Jun 1988, 989-996.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

New trends in psychology and [[cognitive neuroscience]] suggest that applications of [[nonlinear dynamics]], chaos and [[self-organization]] seem to be particularly important for research of some fundamental problems regarding mind-brain relationship. Relevant problems among others are formations of memories during alterations of mental states and nature of a barrier that divides mental states, and leads to the process called [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]]. This process is related to a formation of groups of [[neuron]]s which often synchronize their firing patterns in a unique spatial manner. The central theme of this study is the relationship between level of moving and oscillating [[mental process]]es and their [[neurophysiological]] substrate. This presents a question about principles of organization of the conscious experience and how the experiences happen in the brain. Chaotic self-organization provides a unique theoretical and experimental tool for deeper understanding of dissociative phenomena and enables to study how dissociative phenomena can be linked to [[epilepsy|epileptiform]] discharges which are related to various forms of psychological and somatic manifestations. Organizing principles that constitute human consciousness and other mental phenomena from this point of view may be described by analysis and reconstruction of underlying dynamics of psychophysiological measures.&lt;ref&gt;Chaos, brain and divided consciousness.

This is illustrated here in two dimensions; in reality, both [[biomolecule]]s and organisms evolve in many different dimensions.]]
'''Dollo's law of irreversibility''' (also known as '''Dollo's law''' and '''Dollo's principle'''), proposed in 1893&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dollo | first=Louis | authorlink=Louis Dollo | year=1893 | title=Les lois de l'évolution | url=http://www.paleoglot.net/files/Dollo_93.pdf | journal=Bull. Soc. Belge Geol. Pal. Hydr | volume=VII | issue=| pages=164–166 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[France|French]]-born [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Louis Dollo]] states that, "an organism never returns exactly to a former state, even if it finds itself placed in conditions of existence identical to those in which it has previously lived ... it always keeps some trace of the intermediate stages through which it has passed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Gould | first=S. J. | authorlink=Stephen J. Gould | year=1970 | title=Dollo on Dollo’s law: irreversibility and the status of evolutionary laws| journal=Journal of the History of Biology| volume=3 | pages=189–212 | doi=10.1007/bf00137351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement is often misinterpreted as claiming that evolution is not reversible, or that lost structures and organs cannot reappear in the same form by any process of [[Devolution (biology)|devolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x | pmid=18764918 | volume=62 | issue=11 | pages=2727–2741 | last=Goldberg | first=Emma E. |author2=Boris Igić | title=On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution | journal=Evolution | year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 | pmid=18814933 | volume=23 | issue=11 | pages=602–609 | last=Collin | first=Rachel |author2=Maria Pia Miglietta | title=Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Dawkins]], the law is "really just a statement about the statistical improbability of following exactly the same evolutionary trajectory twice (or, indeed, any particular trajectory), in either direction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard | last=Dawkins | authorlink=Richard Dawkins | title=The Blind Watchmaker | publisher=W. W. Norton | origyear=1986 | year=1996 | isbn=0-393-31570-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggested that [[irreversibility]] forecloses certain evolutionary pathways once broad forms have emerged: "[For example], once you adopt the ordinary body plan of a [[reptile]], hundreds of options are forever closed, and future possibilities must unfold within the limits of inherited design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Gould, Stephen J. |last=Gould |first=Stephen J. |origyear=1993 |year=2007 |title=Eight little piggies |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-09-950744-4 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This principle is classically applied to [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], particularly of [[fossils]], but may also be used to describe [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular events]], such as individual [[mutations]] or gene losses.

==Use in phylogenetics==
In [[maximum parsimony]], Dollo parsimony refers to a model whereby a character is gained only one time and can never be regained if it is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=77-88 | author=Farris, J. | title=Phylogenetic Analysis Under Dollo's Law | journal=Systematic Zoology | year=1977 | doi=10.1093/sysbio/26.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the evolution and repeated loss of [[teeth]] in [[vertebrates]] could be well-modeled under Dollo parsimony, whereby teeth made from [[hydroxyapatite]] evolved only once at the origin of vertebrates, and were then lost multiple times, in [[birds]], [[turtles]], and [[seahorses]], among others.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

This also applies to molecular characters, such as losses or [[nonsense mutation|inactivation]] of individual genes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Rogozin, Igor B.; Wolf, Yuri I.; Babenko, Vladimir N.; Koonin, Eugene V. | title= Dollo parsimony and the reconstruction of genome evolution | journal=Parsimony, Phylogeny, and Genomics | year=2005 | doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297306.003.0011 | url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199297306.001.0001/acprof-9780199297306-chapter-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of [[gulonolactone oxidase]], the final enzyme in the [[Biosynthesis|biosynthetic pathway]] of [[vitamin C]], is responsible for the dietary requirement of vitamin C in humans, as well as many other animals.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==A molecular example==

A 2009 study on the evolution of [[protein structure]] proposed a new mechanism for Dollo's law. It examined a [[hormone receptor]] that had evolved from an ancestral [[protein]] that was able to bind two [[hormone]]s to a new protein that was specific for a single hormone. This change was produced by two [[amino acid]] [[Point mutation|substitutions]], which prevent binding of the second hormone. However, several other changes subsequently occurred, which were selectively neutral as they did not affect hormone binding. When the authors tried to revert the protein back to its ancestral state by mutating the two "binding residues", they found the other changes had destabilised the ancestral state of the protein. They concluded that in order for this protein to evolve in reverse and regain its ability to bind two hormones, several independent neutral [[mutation]]s would have to occur purely by chance with no selection pressure. As this is extremely unlikely, it may explain why evolution tends to run in one direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid=19779450 | volume=461 | issue=7263 | pages=515–519 | last=Bridgham | first=Jamie T. |author2=Ortlund, Eric A. |author3=Thornton, Joseph W. | title=An epistatic ratchet constrains the direction of glucocorticoid receptor evolution | journal=Nature | year=2009 | doi=10.1038/nature08249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed exceptions to Dollo's law==

Although the exact threshold for violations of Dollo's law is unclear, there are several case studies whose results dispute the validity of some interpretations. For example, many taxa of [[gastropod]]s have reduced [[gastropod shell|shells]], and some have lost coiling of their shell altogether.&lt;ref name="Collin"/&gt; In [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s interpretation of Dollo's law, it would not be possible to regain a coiled shell after the coiling has been lost. Nevertheless, a few genera in the slipper snail family ([[Calyptraeidae]]) may have changed their developmental timing ([[heterochrony]]) and regained a coiled shell from a [[limpet]]-like shell.&lt;ref name="Collin"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1=Collin | first1=R.| last2=Cipriani | first2=R.| year=2003| title=Dollo's law and the re-evolution of shell coiling| journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B| volume=270 | issue=1533 | pages=2551–2555| doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2517| pmc=1691546| pmid=14728776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pagel2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Pagel | first1=M. | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2004.03.020 | title=Limpets break Dollo's Law | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume=19 | pages=278 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other proposed 'exceptions' include the wings of [[stick insect]]s,&lt;ref name=Whiting&gt;Whiting, MF.,S.

'''Elizabeth Barnes''' is an American [[philosopher]] working in [[feminist philosophy]], [[metaphysics]], [[social philosophy]] and [[ethics]]. Barnes is a professor of philosophy at the Corcoran Department of Philosophy, [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philosophy.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/ejb5r|title=Barnes Virginia staff page|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Barnes was born in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], and was raised around [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;"[http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/elizabeth-barnes/ Elizabeth Barnes]". What Is it Like to Be a Philosopher.

After graduating from St Andrews, Barnes held posts in the philosophy department at the [[University of Leeds]] from 2006, before joining the faculty at [[University of Virginia|Virginia]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2012, she became editor-in-chief of the [[academic journal|journal]] ''Philosophy Compass''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1747-9991/homepage/EditorialBoard.html Editorial Board],  ''Philosophy Compass'', [[Wiley Online Library]]. Accessed November 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes has published across various fields in philosophy,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and edited a volume entitled ''Current Controversies in Metaphysics'', which was published with [[Routledge]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Elizabeth, ed. (2015). ''Current Controversies in Metaphysics''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, her [[monograph]] ''The Minority Body'' was published with [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Elizabeth (2016). ''The Minority Body''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Barnes challenges the view of [[disability]] common in [[analytic philosophy]], arguing instead that it is primarily a social phenomenon. Disabled persons, she argues, are not intrinsically worse off in virtue of being disabled, even though disability can be, in a restricted sense, a harm.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Stephen M., and Joseph A.

'''Exceptionalism''' is the perception or belief that a species, country, society, institution, movement, individual, or time period is "[[wiktionary:exceptional|exceptional]]" (''i.e.'', unusual or extraordinary). The term carries the implication that the referent is superior in some way, whether specified or not. Although the idea appears to have developed with respect to an era, today the term is particularly applied in national or regional contexts. Other uses include medical and genetic exceptionalism. 

==History==
The German romantic philosopher-historians, especially [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814), dwelt on the theme of uniqueness in the late 18th century. They de-emphasized the political state and instead emphasized the uniqueness of the ''Volk'', comprising the whole people, their languages and traditions.  Each nation, considered as a cultural entity with its own distinctive history, possessed a "national spirit", or "soul of the people" (in German: ''Volksgeist'').  This idea had a strong influence in the growth of nationalism in 19th-century European lands—especially in ones ruled by [[élite]]s from somewhere else.&lt;ref&gt;Royal J. Schmidt, "Cultural Nationalism in Herder", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 17, No. 3 (June 1956), pp. 407–17 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707552 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Hans Kohn, "The Paradox of Fichte's Nationalism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 10, No. 3 (June 1949), pp. 319–43 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2707040 in JSTOR] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims of exceptionality have been made for many countries, including the [[United States]], Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanrights.gov.au/news/speeches/international-human-rights-australian-exceptionalism|title=Speeches|website=www.humanrights.gov.au|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; France, Germany, Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk/files/exceptionalism/article2.html|title=Questioning Greek Exceptionalism|first=wehnerj|last=(jwehner@wehnerweb.com)|website=www.mod-langs.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, Pakistan, [[Imperial Japan]], Iran, Israel, North Korea, South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2013-10-24-south-africa-is-in-africa/#.WMCbezuGPIU|title=South Africa IS in 'Africa' - Daily Maverick|first=Simamkele|last=Dlakavu|publisher=|accessdate=1 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://journalismiziko.dut.ac.za/feature-review/south-africas-worrying-exceptionalism/ | title=South Africa's Worrying Exceptionalism | publisher=[[Durban University of Technology]] | work=Iziko Live | date=October 29, 2013 | accessdate=September 2, 2018 | author=Raymond Padya, Journalism Editor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain, Britain, the USSR, the European Union, and Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://nolte.rewi.hu-berlin.de/doc/pub/European_Exceptionalism.pdf | title=European exceptionalism? | author=[[Georg Nolte]] and Helmut Philipp Aust | journal=Global Constitutionalism | year=2013 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=407 – 436 | doi=10.1017/S2045381713000038| hdl=10419/66220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=du même auteur |url=http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=EUFOR_359_0083 |title=Becoming Exceptional?

Chase-Dunn, Thomas D. Hall, and E. Susan Manning, "Rise and Fall: East-West Synchronicity and Indic Exceptionalism Reexamined", ''Social Science History'', Volume 24, Number 4, Winter 2000, pp. 727–54 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/social_science_history/v024/24.4chase-dunn.html in Project Muse]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism == 

Belief in exceptionalism can represent erroneous thought analogous to [[historicism]] in that it overemphasizes peculiarities in an analysis and ignores or downplays meaningful comparisons {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. A group may assert ''exceptionalism'' in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, to invoke a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}. This can be an example of [[special pleading]], a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparisons {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}.

== Separateness ==
[[J. Bradford DeLong]] has used the term "exceptionalism" to describe the economic growth of post-[[World War II]] [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLong|first1=J. Bradford|authorlink1=J. Bradford DeLong|title=Post-WWII Western European Exceptionalism: The Economic Dimension|url=http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/ucla/ucla_marshall2.html|publisher=[[University of California]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728125244/http://econ161.berkeley.edu/Econ_Articles/ucla/ucla_marshall2.html|archivedate=28 July 2012|location=Berkeley|date=September 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptionalism can represent an error analogous to [[historicism]] in assuming that only peculiarities are relevant to analysis, while overlooking meaningful comparisons. "[W]hat is seemingly exceptional in one country may be found in other countries."{{attribution needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/discussionpapers/Matsuda.html |title=ejcjs - Exceptionalism in Political Science: Japanese Politics, US Politics, and Supposed International Norms |publisher=Japanesestudies.org.uk |date= 2003-08-13|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ideologically-driven debates, a group may assert ''exceptionalism'', with or without the term, in order to exaggerate the appearance of difference, perhaps to create an atmosphere permissive of a wider latitude of action, and to avoid recognition of similarities that would reduce perceived justifications. If unwarranted, this represents an example of [[special pleading]], a form of spurious argumentation that ignores relevant bases for meaningful comparison.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The term "exceptionalism" can imply criticism of a tendency to remain separate from others. For example, the reluctance of the [[United States]] government to join various [[international treaties]] is sometimes called "exceptionalist".&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park |first=Jeanne |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2000-11-01/new-sovereigntists-american-exceptionalism-and-its-false-prophets |title=The New Sovereigntists: American Exceptionalism and Its False Prophets |journal=Foreign Affairs |issue=November/December 2000 |date= November 2000|accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical exceptionalism==
Use of the term "[[HIV exceptionalism]]" implies that AIDS is a contagious disease that is or should be treated differently from other contagions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hanssens |first=Catherine ([[Lambda Legal]]) |url=http://www.thebody.com/hanssens/exceptionalism.html |title=Inventing "AIDS Exceptionalism" |publisher=[[TheBody.com]]|date=Winter 1997/1998 |accessdate=2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or entails benefits not available to those suffering from other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Sheryl Gay Stolberg|title=New Challenge to Idea That 'AIDS Is Special'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/12/us/new-challenge-to-idea-that-aids-is-special.html?pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 November 2015|location=[[New York City]]|date=12 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[United States Congress]]|title=Congressional Record, V. 152, Pt. 16, September 29 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwW_dE91hF4C&amp;pg=PA539-IA69|date=25 October 2010|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office]]|location=|isbn=978-0-16-086781-1|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic exceptionalism]] is a policy program that [[medicalizes]] genetic information.  Like the exceptionalism surrounding HIV testing, genetic exceptionalism is based on the belief that the average person needs a licensed health professional for guidance and support through the discovery of information with health implications, even if this information is common knowledge, such as that the person has red hair, which is associated with a higher risk of sunburns and skin cancer.  In countries with strong genetic exceptionalism laws, permission from a physician is necessary to obtain information about one's genes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

'''Exercise physiology''' is the [[physiology]] of [[physical exercise]]. It is the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to exercise.

Understanding the effect of exercise involves studying specific changes in [[muscular]], [[cardiovascular]], and neurohumoral [[Biological system|systems]] that lead to changes in functional capacity and [[Physical strength|strength]] due to [[endurance training]] or [[strength training]].&lt;ref name="Awtry"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Awtry|first1=Eric H.|title=Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine|last2=Balady|first2=Gary J.|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkin|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7817-7012-5|editor1-last=Topol|editor1-first=Eric J.|editor1-link=Eric Topol|edition=3rd|page=83|chapter=Exercise and Physical Activity|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=35zSLWyEWbcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of training on the body has been defined as the reaction to the adaptive responses of the body arising from exercise&lt;ref name="Bompa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Periodization: Theory and Methodology of Training|last1=Bompa|first1=Tudor O.|last2=Haff|first2=G.

== Energy expenditure==
Humans have a high capacity to expend [[Oxidative phosphorylation|energy]] for many hours during sustained exertion. For example, one individual cycling at a speed of {{convert|26.4|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} through {{convert|8204|km|mi|abbr=on}} over 50 consecutive days expended a total of 1,145 MJ (273,850 kcal; 273,850 dieter calories) with an average power output of 182.5 W.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19005357|year=2008|last1=Gianetti|first1=G|last2=Burton|first2=L|last3=Donovan|first3=R|last4=Allen|first4=G|last5=Pescatello|first5=LS|title=Physiologic and psychological responses of an athlete cycling 100+ miles daily for 50 consecutive days|volume=7|issue=6|pages=343–7|doi=10.1249/JSR.0b013e31818f0670|journal=Current Sports Medicine Reports}}. This individual while exceptional was not physiologically extraordinary since he was described as "subelite" due to his not being "able to adjust power output to regulate energy expenditure as occurs with elite athletes during ultra-cycling events" page 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletal muscle burns 90&amp;nbsp;mg (0.5 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]) of glucose each minute during continuous activity (such as when repetitively extending the human knee),&lt;ref name="Richter, E.

For short duration muscular exertion, energy expenditure can be far greater: an adult human male when jumping up from a squat can mechanically generate 314 W/kg. Such rapid movement can generate twice this amount in nonhuman animals such as [[bonobo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16901837|year=2006|last1=Scholz|first1=MN|last2=d'Août|first2=K|last3=Bobbert|first3=MF|last4=Aerts|first4=P|title=Vertical jumping performance of bonobo (Pan paniscus) suggests superior muscle properties|volume=273|issue=1598|pages=2177–84|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3568|pmc=1635523|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some small lizards.&lt;ref&gt;Curtin, NA; Woledge, RC; Aerts, P (2005).

This energy expenditure is very large compared to the basal resting metabolic rate of the adult human body. This rate varies somewhat with size, gender and age but is typically between 45 W and 85 W.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16277825|year=2005|last1=Henry|first1=CJ|title=Basal metabolic rate studies in humans: Measurement and development of new equations|volume=8|issue=7A|pages=1133–52|journal=Public Health Nutrition|doi=10.1079/phn2005801}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Henry 2005 provides BMR formula various ages given body weight: those for BMR aged 18–30 in MJ/day (where mass is body weight in kg) are: male BMR = 0.0669 mass + 2.28; females BMR = 0.0546 mass + 2.33; 1 MJ per day = 11.6 W. The data providing these formula hide a high variance: for men weighing 70 kg, measured BMR is between 50 and 110 W, and women weighing 60 kg, between 40 W and 90 W.&lt;/ref&gt; Total energy expenditure ([[Total energy expenditure|TEE]]) due to muscular expended energy is much higher and depends upon the average level of physical work and exercise done during a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16277815|year=2005|last1=Torun|first1=B|title=Energy requirements of children and adolescents|volume=8|issue=7A|pages=968–93|journal=Public Health Nutrition|doi=10.1079/phn2005791}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus exercise, particularly if sustained for very long periods, dominates the energy metabolism of the body.

=== Rapid energy sources ===
Energy needed to perform short lasting, high intensity bursts of activity is derived from [[anaerobic metabolism]] within the [[cytosol]] of muscle cells, as opposed to [[aerobic respiration]] which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the [[mitochondria]]. The quick energy sources consist of the [[phosphocreatine]] (PCr) system, fast [[glycolysis]], and [[adenylate kinase]]. All of these systems re-synthesize [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme [[creatine kinase]]. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines [[phosphocreatine]] and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and [[creatine]]. This resource is short lasting because oxygen is required for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via [[glycogen phosphorylase]] into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic condition is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time. Lastly, adenylate kinase catalyzes a reaction by which 2 ADP are combined to form ATP and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). This reaction takes place during low energy situations such as extreme exercise or conditions of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], but is not a significant source of energy. The creation of AMP resulting from this reaction stimulates [[AMP-activated protein kinase]] (AMP kinase) which is the energy sensor of the cell. After sensing low energy conditions, AMP kinase stimulates various other intracellular enzymes geared towards increasing energy supply and decreasing all anabolic, or energy requiring, cell functions.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Plasma glucose ===
Plasma glucose is said to be maintained when there is an equal rate of glucose appearance (entry into the blood) and glucose disposal (removal from the blood). In the healthy individual, the rates of appearance and disposal are essentially equal during exercise of moderate intensity and duration; however, prolonged exercise or sufficiently intense exercise can result in an imbalance leaning towards a higher rate of disposal than appearance, at which point glucose levels fall producing the onset of fatigue. Rate of glucose appearance is dictated by the amount of glucose being absorbed at the gut as well as liver (hepatic) glucose output. Although glucose absorption from the gut is not typically a source of glucose appearance during exercise, the liver is capable of catabolizing stored [[glycogen]] ([[glycogenolysis]]) as well as synthesizing new glucose from specific reduced carbon molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, and lactate) in a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. The ability of the liver to release glucose into the blood from glycogenolysis is unique, since skeletal muscle, the other major glycogen reservoir, is incapable of doing so. Unlike skeletal muscle, liver cells contain the enzyme [[(glycogen-synthase-D) phosphatase|glycogen phosphatase]], which removes a phosphate group from glucose-6-P to release free glucose. In order for glucose to exit a cell membrane, the removal of this phosphate group is essential. Although gluconeogenesis is an important component of hepatic glucose output, it alone can not sustain exercise. For this reason, when glycogen stores are depleted during exercise, glucose levels fall and fatigue sets in. Glucose disposal, the other side of the equation, is controlled by uptake of glucose at the working skeletal muscles. During exercise, despite decreased [[insulin]] concentrations, muscle increases [[GLUT4]] translocation of and glucose uptake. The mechanism for increased GLUT4 translocation is an area of ongoing research.

'''glucose control''':
As mentioned above, insulin secretion is reduced during exercise, and does not play a major role in maintaining normal blood glucose concentration during exercise, but its counter-regulatory hormones appear in increasing concentrations. Principle among these are [[glucagon]], [[epinephrine]], and [[growth hormone]]. All of these hormones stimulate liver (hepatic) glucose output, among other functions. For instance, both epinephrine and growth hormone also stimulate adipocyte lipase, which increases non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release. By oxidizing fatty acids, this spares glucose utilization and helps to maintain blood sugar level during exercise.

'''Exercise for diabetes''':
Exercise is a particularly potent tool for glucose control in those who have [[diabetes mellitus]]. In a situation of elevated blood glucose ([[hyperglycemia]]), moderate exercise can induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, there appears to be an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with [[ketoacidosis]]. Exercise could exacerbate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA's.

Type II diabetes is also intricately linked to obesity, and there may be a connection between type II diabetes and how fat is stored within pancreatic, muscle, and liver cells. Likely due to this connection, weight loss from both exercise and diet tends to increase insulin sensitivity in the majority of people. In some people, this effect can be particularly potent and can result in normal glucose control. Although nobody is technically cured of diabetes, individuals can live normal lives without the fear of diabetic complications; however, regain of weight would assuredly result in diabetes signs and symptoms.

=== Oxygen ===

Vigorous physical activity (such as exercise or hard labor) increases the body's demand for oxygen. The first-line physiologic response to this demand is an increase in [[heart rate]], [[breathing rate]], and [[deep breathing|depth of breathing]].

Oxygen consumption (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during exercise is best described by the [[Fick Equation]]: VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=Q x (a-vO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;diff), which states that the amount of oxygen consumed is equal to [[cardiac output]] (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, it is not the only determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise ([[ergogenic aids]]) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells ([[hematocrit]]), such as through [[blood doping]] or the use of [[erythropoietin]] (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive [[viscera]] to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.

=== Dehydration ===
[[Dehydration]] refers both to hypohydration (dehydration induced prior to exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance and results in increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although the negative effects of exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to believe for years thereafter that fluid intake was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (&lt;2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce plasma volume, or prior exercise, which has much less impact on plasma volume. Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10198142|year=1999|last1=Barr|first1=SI|title=Effects of dehydration on exercise performance|volume=24|issue=2|pages=164–72|journal=Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1139/h99-014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by [[sweat]]-based [[thermoregulation]]. A male [[marathon]] runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower).&lt;ref name ="cheuvront"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheuvront SN, Haymes EM | year = 2001 | title = Thermoregulation and marathon running: biological and environmental influences | url = | journal = Sports Med | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 743–62 | doi=10.2165/00007256-200131100-00004| pmid = 11547895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11385091|year=2001|last1=Porter|first1=AM|title=Why do we have apocrine and sebaceous glands?|volume=94|issue=5|pages=236–7|pmc=1281456|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35&amp;nbsp;°C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.&lt;ref name ="cheuvront"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=8594004|year=1995|last1=González-Alonso|first1=J|last2=Mora-Rodríguez|first2=R|last3=Below|first3=PR|last4=Coyle|first4=EF|title=Dehydration reduces cardiac output and increases systemic and cutaneous vascular resistance during exercise|volume=79|issue=5|pages=1487–96|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1152/jappl.1995.79.5.1487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain as a result is highly sensitive to failure of its oxygen supply with loss of consciousness occurring within six to seven seconds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rossen R, Kabat H, Anderson JP | year = 1943 | title = Acute arrest of cerebral circulation in man | url = | journal = Arch Neurol Psychiat | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 510–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with its [[EEG]] going flat in 23 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=7303071|year=1981|last1=Todd|first1=MM|last2=Dunlop|first2=BJ|last3=Shapiro|first3=HM|last4=Chadwick|first4=HC|last5=Powell|first5=HC|title=Ventricular fibrillation in the cat: A model for global cerebral ischemia|volume=12|issue=6|pages=808–15|journal=Stroke: A Journal of Cerebral Circulation|doi=10.1161/01.STR.12.6.808}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it affected the oxygen and glucose supply to the brain, the metabolic demands of exercise could therefore quickly disrupt its functioning.

Protecting the brain from even minor disruption is important since exercise depends upon [[motor skill|motor control]], and particularly, because humans are bipeds, the motor control needed for keeping balance. Indeed, for this reason, brain energy consumption is increased during intense physical exercise due to the demands in the motor cognition needed to control the body.&lt;ref name="Secher, N. H. 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17962575|year=2008|last1=Secher|first1=NH|last2=Seifert|first2=T|last3=Van Lieshout|first3=JJ|title=Cerebral blood flow and metabolism during exercise: Implications for fatigue|volume=104|issue=1|pages=306–14|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00853.2007|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cerebral oxygen ===
[[Autoregulation#Cerebral autoregulation|Cerebral autoregulation]] usually ensures the brain has priority to cardiac output, though this is impaired slightly by exhaustive exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15498819|year=2005|last1=Ogoh|first1=S|last2=Dalsgaard|first2=MK|last3=Yoshiga|first3=CC|last4=Dawson|first4=EA|last5=Keller|first5=DM|last6=Raven|first6=PB|last7=Secher|first7=NH|title=Dynamic cerebral autoregulation during exhaustive exercise in humans|volume=288|issue=3|pages=H1461–7|doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00948.2004|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glucose ===
In adults, exercise depletes the plasma glucose available to the brain: short intense exercise (35 min ergometer cycling) can reduce brain glucose uptake by 32%.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16037089|year=2005|last1=Kemppainen|first1=J|last2=Aalto|first2=S|last3=Fujimoto|first3=T|last4=Kalliokoski|first4=KK|last5=Långsjö|first5=J|last6=Oikonen|first6=V|last7=Rinne|first7=J|last8=Nuutila|first8=P|last9=Knuuti|first9=J|title=High intensity exercise decreases global brain glucose uptake in humans|volume=568|issue=Pt 1|pages=323–32|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2005.091355|pmc=1474763|journal=The Journal of Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At rest, energy for the adult brain is normally provided by glucose but the brain has a compensatory capacity to replace some of this with [[lactic acid|lactate]]. Research suggests that this can be raised, when a person rests in a [[Positron emission tomography|brain scanner]], to about 17%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=12796713|year=2003|last1=Smith|first1=D|last2=Pernet|first2=A|last3=Hallett|first3=WA|last4=Bingham|first4=E|last5=Marsden|first5=PK|last6=Amiel|first6=SA|title=Lactate: A preferred fuel for human brain metabolism in vivo|volume=23|issue=6|pages=658–64|doi=10.1097/01.WCB.0000063991.19746.11|journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism : Official Journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a higher percentage of 25% occurring during [[hypoglycemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16144821|year=2006|last1=Lubow|first1=JM|last2=Piñón|first2=IG|last3=Avogaro|first3=A|last4=Cobelli|first4=C|last5=Treeson|first5=DM|last6=Mandeville|first6=KA|last7=Toffolo|first7=G|last8=Boyle|first8=PJ|title= Brain oxygen utilization is unchanged by hypoglycemia in normal humans: Lactate, alanine, and leucine uptake are not sufficient to offset energy deficit|volume=290|issue=1|pages=E149–E153|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00049.2005|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

H. 2008"/&gt;

=== Hyperthermia ===
Humans use sweat thermoregulation for body heat removal, particularly to remove the heat produced during exercise. Moderate dehydration as a consequence of exercise and heat is reported to impair cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17545888|year=2007|last1=Baker|first1=LB|last2=Conroy|first2=DE|last3=Kenney|first3=WL|title=Dehydration impairs vigilance-related attention in male basketball players|volume=39|issue=6|pages=976–83|doi=10.1097/mss.0b013e3180471ff2|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11812391|year=2001|last1=Cian|first1=C|last2=Barraud|first2=PA|last3=Melin|first3=B|last4=Raphel|first4=C|title=Effects of fluid ingestion on cognitive function after heat stress or exercise-induced dehydration|volume=42|issue=3|pages=243–51|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|doi=10.1016/S0167-8760(01)00142-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These impairments can start after body mass lost that is greater than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=3743537|year=1986|last1=Sharma|first1=VM|last2=Sridharan|first2=K|last3=Pichan|first3=G|last4=Panwar|first4=MR|title=Influence of heat-stress induced dehydration on mental functions|volume=29|issue=6|pages=791–9|doi=10.1080/00140138608968315|journal=Ergonomics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive impairment, particularly due to heat and exercise is likely to be due to loss of integrity to the blood brain barrier.&lt;ref name="Maughan, R.

== Fatigue ==

=== Intense activity ===
Researchers once attributed fatigue to a build-up of lactic acid in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=6913479|year=1981|last1=Hermansen|first1=L|title=Effect of metabolic changes on force generation in skeletal muscle during maximal exercise|volume=82|pages=75–88|journal=Ciba Foundation Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is no longer believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11579151|year=2001|last1=Brooks|first1=GA|title=Lactate doesn't necessarily cause fatigue: Why are we surprised?|volume=536|issue=Pt 1|pages=1|pmc=2278833|journal=The Journal of Physiology|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7793.2001.t01-1-00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15131240|year=2004|last1=Gladden|first1=LB|title=Lactate metabolism: A new paradigm for the third millennium|volume=558|issue=Pt 1|pages=5–30|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2003.058701|pmc=1664920|journal=The Journal of Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, lactate may stop muscle fatigue by keeping muscles fully responding to nerve signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pedersen TH, Nielsen OB, Lamb GD, Stephenson DG | title = Intracellular acidosis enhances the excitability of working muscle | journal = Science | volume = 305 | issue = 5687 | pages = 1144–7 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15326352 | doi = 10.1126/science.1101141| last2 = Nielsen | last3 = Lamb | last4 = Stephenson | bibcode = 2004Sci...305.1144P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The available oxygen and energy supply, and disturbances of muscle ion homeostasis are the main factor determining exercise performance, at least during brief very intense exercise.

Each [[muscle contraction#Skeletal muscle contractions|muscle contraction]] involves an [[action potential]] that activates voltage sensors, and so releases [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions]] from the [[muscle fibre]]’s [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum#Sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarcoplasmic reticulum]]. The action potentials that cause this require also ion changes:  [[Sodium channel#Voltage-gated|Na influxes]] during the [[depolarization]] phase and K effluxes for the [[repolarization]] phase. [[Chloride channel|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions]] also diffuse into the sarcoplasm to aid the repolarization phase. During intense muscle contraction, the ion pumps that maintain homeostasis of these ions are inactivated and this (with other ion related disruption) causes ionic disturbances. This causes cellular membrane depolarization, inexcitability, and so muscle weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17962569|year=2008|last1=McKenna|first1=MJ|last2=Bangsbo|first2=J|last3=Renaud|first3=JM|title=Muscle K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cl disturbances and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump inactivation: Implications for fatigue|volume=104|issue=1|pages=288–95|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01037.2007|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leakage from type 1 [[ryanodine receptor]]) channels has also been identified with fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18268335|year=2008|last1=Bellinger|first1=AM|last2=Reiken|first2=S|last3=Dura|first3=M|last4=Murphy|first4=PW|last5=Deng|first5=SX|last6=Landry|first6=DW|last7=Nieman|first7=D|last8=Lehnart|first8=SE|last9=Samaru|first9=M|last10=Lacampagne|first10=A.|last11=Marks|first11=A.

[[Image:Dorando Pietri 1908.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Dorando Pietri]] about to collapse at the Marathon finish at the 1908 London Olympic Games]]

=== Endurance failure ===
After intense prolonged exercise, there can be a collapse in body [[Human homeostasis|homeostasis]]. Some famous examples include:
* [[Dorando Pietri]] in the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympic]] [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|men’s marathon]] ran the wrong way and collapsed several times.
* [[James Peters (athlete)|Jim Peters]] in the marathon of the [[1954 Commonwealth Games]]  staggered and collapsed several times, and though he had a five-kilometre (three-mile) lead, failed to finish. Though it was formerly believed that this was due to severe dehydration, more recent research suggests it was the combined effects upon the brain of hyperthermia, hypertonic hypernatraemia associated with dehydration, and possibly hypoglycaemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18928034|year=2008|last1=Noakes|first1=T|last2=Mekler|first2=J|last3=Pedoe|first3=DT|title=Jim Peters' collapse in the 1954 Vancouver Empire Games marathon|volume=98|issue=8|pages=596–600|journal=South African Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gabriela Andersen-Schiess]] in the woman’s marathon at the Los Angeles [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in the race’s final 400 meters, stopping occasionally and shown signs of [[heat exhaustion]]. Though she fell across the finish line, she was released from medical care only two hours later.

=== Central governor ===
[[Tim Noakes]], based on an earlier idea by the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] winner [[Archibald Hill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hill A. V., Long C. N.

In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as [[Muscle weakness|fatigue]] and exhaustion.

== Cardiac biomarkers ==
Prolonged exercise such as marathons can increase [[Cardiac marker|cardiac biomarkers]] such as [[troponin]], [[Brain natriuretic peptide|B-type natriuretic peptide]] (BNP), and ischemia-modified (aka MI) [[albumin]]. This can be misinterpreted by medical personnel as signs of [[myocardial infarction]], or [[Acute coronary syndrome|cardiac dysfunction]]. In these clinical conditions, such cardiac biomarkers are produced by irreversible injury of muscles. In contrast, the processes that create them after strenuous exertion in endurance sports are reversible, with their levels returning to normal within 24-hours (further research, however, is still needed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18614952|year=2008|last1=Scharhag|first1=J|last2=George|first2=K|last3=Shave|first3=R|last4=Urhausen|first4=A|last5=Kindermann|first5=W|title=Exercise-associated increases in cardiac biomarkers|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1408–15|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e318172cf22|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18942493|year=2008|last1=Lippi|first1=G|last2=Schena|first2=F|last3=Salvagno|first3=GL|last4=Montagnana|first4=M|last5=Gelati|first5=M|last6=Tarperi|first6=C|last7=Banfi|first7=G|last8=Guidi|first8=GC|title=Influence of a half-marathon run on NT-proBNP and troponin T|volume=54|issue=7–8|pages=251–4|journal=Clinical Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/health/nutrition/27best.html The Lab Says Heart Attack, but the Patient Is Fine] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human adaptations ==
Humans are specifically [[human evolution|adapted]] to engage in prolonged strenuous muscular activity (such as efficient long distance [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|bipedal]] running).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15549097|year=2004|last1=Bramble|first1=DM|last2=Lieberman|first2=DE|title=Endurance running and the evolution of ''Homo''|volume=432|issue=7015|pages=345–52|doi=10.1038/nature03052|journal=Nature|bibcode=2004Natur.432..345B|url= http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~skeleton/pdfs/2004e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity for endurance running evolved to allow the [[Persistence hunting#Persistence hunting in human evolution|running down]] of game animals by persistent slow but constant chase over many hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/203165|title=The Energetic Paradox of Human Running and Hominid Evolution|year=1984|last1=Carrier|first1=David R.|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=483–495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the success of this is the ability of the human body, unlike that of the animals they hunt, to effectively remove muscle heat waste. In most animals, this is stored by allowing a temporary increase in body temperature. This allows them to escape from animals that quickly speed after them for a short duration (the way nearly all predators catch their prey). Humans, unlike other animals that catch prey, remove heat with a specialized [[Thermoregulation#Variations in the temperature of human beings and some animals|thermoregulation]] based on [[sweating|sweat]] evaporation. One gram of sweat can remove 2,598 J of heat energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=5425034|year=1970|last1=Snellen|first1=JW|last2=Mitchell|first2=D|last3=Wyndham|first3=CH|title=Heat of evaporation of sweat|volume=29|issue=1|pages=40–4|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1152/jappl.1970.29.1.40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism is increased skin blood flow during exercise that allows for greater convective heat loss that is aided by our upright posture. This skin based cooling has resulted in humans acquiring an increased number of [[sweat glands]], combined with a lack of [[fur|body fur]] that would otherwise stop air circulation and efficient evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18613867|year=2008|last1=Lupi|first1=O|title=Ancient adaptations of human skin: Why do we retain sebaceous and apocrine glands?|volume=47|issue=7|pages=651–4|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03765.x|journal=International Journal of Dermatology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because humans can remove exercise heat, they can avoid the fatigue from heat exhaustion that affects animals chased in a persistent manner, and so eventually catch them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/508695|title=Persistence Hunting by Modern Hunter‐Gatherers|year=2006|last1=Liebenberg|first1=Louis|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1017–1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selective breeding experiments with rodents ==
Rodents have been specifically bred for exercise behavior or performance in several different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20148672|year=2010|last1=Feder|first1=ME|last2=Garland Jr|first2=T|last3=Marden|first3=JH|last4=Zera|first4=AJ|title=Locomotion in response to shifting climate zones: Not so fast|volume=72|pages=167–90|doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135804|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|url= http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Feder_et_al_2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, laboratory rats have been bred for high or low performance on a motorized treadmill with electrical stimulation as [[motivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koch, L.

== Exercise-induced muscle pain ==
Physical exercise may cause pain both as an immediate effect that may result from stimulation of [[free nerve endings]] by low pH, as well as a [[delayed onset muscle soreness]]. The delayed soreness is fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle, although apparently not involving the rupture of whole [[muscle fiber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nosaka|first=Ken|title=Skeletal muscle damage and repair|editor=Tiidus, Peter M|publisher=[[Human Kinetics]]|year=2008|pages=59–76|chapter=Muscle Soreness and Damage and the Repeated-Bout Effect|isbn=978-0-7360-5867-4|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueMh1x7kFjsC&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle pain can range from a mild soreness to a debilitating injury depending on intensity of exercise, level of training, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheung|first=Karoline|last2=Hume|first2=Patria A.|last3=Maxwell|first3=Linda|date=2012-10-23|title=Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness|journal=Sports Medicine|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=145–164|doi=10.2165/00007256-200333020-00005|issn=0112-1642|pmid=12617692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education in exercise physiology==

Accreditation programs exist with professional bodies in most developed countries, ensuring the quality and consistency of education. In Canada, one may obtain the professional certification title – Certified Exercise Physiologist for those working with clients (both clinical and non clinical) in the health and fitness industry. An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but is not limited to [[biochemistry]], [[bioenergetics]], [[cardiopulmonary]] function, [[hematology]], [[biomechanics]], [[skeletal muscle]] physiology, [[neuroendocrine]] function, and central and peripheral [[nervous system]] function. Furthermore, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.

Colleges and universities offer exercise physiology as a program of study on various different levels, including undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs.  The basis of Exercise Physiology as a major is to prepare students for a career in field of health sciences.  A program that focuses on the scientific study of the physiological processes involved in physical or motor activity, including sensorimotor interactions, response mechanisms, and the effects of injury, disease, and disability. Includes instruction in muscular and skeletal anatomy; molecular and cellular basis of muscle contraction; fuel utilization; neurophysiology of motor mechanics; systemic physiological responses (respiration, blood flow, endocrine secretions, and others); fatigue and exhaustion; muscle and body training; physiology of specific exercises and activities; physiology of injury; and the effects of disabilities and disease. Careers available with a degree in Exercise Physiology can include: non-clinical, client-based work; strength and conditioning specialists; cardiopulmonary treatment; and clinical-based research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Paul|title=Careers in Exercise Physiology|url=http://www.americankinesiology.org/featured-careers/featured-careers/exercise-physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to gauge the multiple areas of study, students are taught processes in which to follow on a client-based level.  Practical and lecture teachings are instructed in the classroom and in a laboratory setting. These include:

*'''Health and risk assessment''': In order to safely work with a client on the job, you must first be able to know the benefits and risks associated with physical activity. Examples of this include knowing specific injuries the body can experience during exercise, how to properly screen a client before their training begins, and what factors to look for that may inhibit their performance.
*'''Exercise testing''':  Coordinating exercise tests in order to measure body compositions, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and flexibility.  Functional tests are also used in order to gain understanding on a more specific part of the body.  Once the information is gathered about a client, exercise physiologists must also be able to interpret the test data and decide what health-related outcomes have been discovered.
*'''Exercise prescription''':  Forming training programs that best meet an individuals health and fitness goals.  Must be able to take into account different types of exercises, the reasons/goal for a clients workout, and pre-screened assessments.  Knowing how to prescribe exercises for special considerations and populations is also required.  These may include age differences, pregnancy, joint diseases, obesity, pulmonary disease, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American College of Sports Medicine|title=ACSM's guidelines for exercise testing and prescription|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6903-7|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===

The curriculum for exercise physiology includes [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[applied sciences]].  The purpose of the classes selected for this major is to have a proficient understanding of human anatomy, human physiology, and exercise physiology.  Includes instruction in muscular and skeletal anatomy; molecular and cellular basis of muscle contraction; fuel utilization; [[neurophysiology]] of motor mechanics; systemic physiological responses (respiration, blood flow, endocrine secretions, and others); fatigue and exhaustion; muscle and body training; physiology of specific exercises and activities; physiology of injury; and the effects of disabilities and disease.  Not only is a full class schedule needed to complete a degree in Exercise Physiology, but a minimum amount of practicum experience is required and internships are recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University|first=Ohio|title=Class Requirements|url=http://www.ohio.edu/chsp/ahsw/academics/exphu.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florian Witold Znaniecki''' (15 January 1882&amp;nbsp;– 23 March 1958) was a Polish [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who taught and wrote in [[Poland]] and in the [[United States]]. Over the course of his work he shifted his focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology; the founder of Polish academic sociology, and of an entire [[school of thought]] in sociology.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt; He won international renown as [[co-author]], with [[William I. Thomas]], of the study, ''[[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]'' (1918–20), which is considered the foundation of modern [[empirical sociology]]. He also made major contributions to [[sociological theory]], introducing terms such as [[humanistic coefficient]] and [[culturalism]].

In Poland, he established the first Polish department of sociology at [[Adam Mickiewicz University]] where he worked from 1920 to 1939. His career in the US begun at the [[University of Chicago]] (1917 to 1919) and continued at [[Columbia University]] (1932 to 1934 and 1939 to 1940) and at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (1942 to 1950). He was the 44th President of the [[American Sociological Association]] (for the year 1954).

==Life==

===Childhood and education===
Florian Znaniecki was born on 15 January 1882 at [[Świątniki, Włocławek County|Świątniki]], [[Congress Poland]], a state [[Russian partition|controlled]] by the [[Russian Empire]]&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1986-13"/&gt; to Leon Znaniecki and Amelia, née Holtz&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1400728&lt;/ref&gt; He received early schooling from tutors, then attended secondary schools at [[Warsaw]] and [[Częstochowa]].&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/&gt; While in secondary school, he was a member of [[Flying University#Partitions|an underground study]] group, specializing in history, literature and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-2425"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-3334"/&gt; His secondary-school grades were average at best, and he had to repeat a year of school; this was largely due to his extracurricular interest in [[Polish language|Polish-language]] study, which was banned under the [[Russification|Russified]] school program.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-2425"/&gt; As a youth, he wrote some poetry, including a [[drama]], ''Cheops'' (1903).&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-754"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-2533"/&gt; A poem of his, ''"Do Prometeusza"'' ("To Prometheus"), was included in a 1900 anthology; however, neither he in later life, nor literary critics, judged his poetry outstanding.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-2533"/&gt;

He entered the [[Imperial University of Warsaw]] in 1902, but was soon expelled after taking part in protests against the Russian administration's curtailment of student rights.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-3334"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-231"/&gt; Threatened with [[conscription]] into the [[Imperial Russian Army]], he chose to emigrate&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-231"/&gt; and in early 1904 left Warsaw for [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-37"/&gt;

During that period, he was briefly an editor at a French-language literary magazine, ''Nice Illustrée'' (late 1904 &amp;ndash; early 1905);&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-232"/&gt; faked his own death; briefly served in the [[French Foreign Legion]] in [[Algeria]]; and worked at a [[flea market]], on a farm, in a traveling circus,&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-232"/&gt; and as a librarian at the [[Polish Museum, Rapperswil|Polish Museum]] in [[Rapperswil]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-43"/&gt;

In Switzerland he soon resumed his university studies, first at the [[University of Geneva]] (1905–07), then at the [[University of Zurich]] (1907–08), eventually transferring to the [[Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]], [[France]] (1908–09), where he attended lectures by sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]].&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-234"/&gt; In 1909, after the death of his supervisor [[Frédéric Rauh]], he returned to Poland, where in 1910 he obtained his [[Ph.D.]] degree at [[Jagiellonian University]], in [[Kraków]], under a new supervisor, [[Maurycy Straszewski]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-4649"/&gt;

===Early Polish career===
That year he also joined the [[Polish Psychological Society]] (''Polskie Towarzystwo Psychologiczne''), in which he would be highly active over the next few years, becoming its vice president in 1913–14.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-5153"/&gt; Much of his early academic work at that time could be classified as [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-55"/&gt;  In 1909, aged 27, he published his first academic paper, ''Etyka filozoficzna i nauka o wartościach moralnych'' ("Philosophical Ethics and the Science of Moral Values");&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-54"/&gt; a year later he published ''Zagadnienie wartości w filozofii'' (''The Question of Values in Philosophy''), based on his doctoral dissertation,&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-234"/&gt; and a paper, ''Myśl i rzeczywistosc'' ("Mind and Reality").&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-63"/&gt; In 1912 he published a new book, ''Humanizm i Poznanie'' (''Humanism and Knowledge''), and a paper, ''Elementy rzeczywistości praktycznej'' ("Elements of Practical Reality").&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-63"/&gt; A year later, he published an annotated translation of [[Henri Bergson]]'s ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]''&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-76-77"/&gt; and a paper, ''Znaczenie rozwoju świata i człowieka'' ("The Meaning of World and Human Development").&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-81"/&gt;  The year 1914 saw the publication of his papers, ''Formy i zasady twórczości moralnej'' ("Forms and Principles of Moral Creativity")&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-95"/&gt; and ''Zasada względności jako podstawa filizofii'' ("The Principle of Relativity as a Foundation of Philosophy").&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-54"/&gt; His works, published in Polish, were well received by the Polish scholarly community and [[intelligentsia]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-101"/&gt;

Due to his past political activism, he was unable to secure a post at a major university.&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-48"/&gt; From 1912 to 1914 he lectured at a novel women's institution of higher education, the [[Advanced Pedagogical Courses for Women]] (''Wyższe Kursy Pedagogiczne dla Kobiet'').&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-5153"/&gt; During his studies, he had worked at several European institutions dealing with Polish immigrants; he would build on his experiences by becoming involved with the Warsaw-based [[Society for the Welfare of Émigrés]] (''Towarzystwo Opieki nad Wychodźcami''), where he worked in 1910–14.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-233"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1994-234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-106"/&gt; By 1911 he was the Society's director and (1911–12) editor of its journal,  ''Wychodźca Polski'' (''The Polish Émigré'').&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-109-110"/&gt;  Znaniecki became an expert on Polish migration, in 1914 authoring for the government a 500-page report, ''Wychodźtwo Sezonowe'' (''Seasonal Migration'').&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-131-134"/&gt;

===Work with Thomas===
[[File:Znaniecki 1918 the polish peasant in europe and america cover.png|thumb|200px|Volume I (1918) of ''The Polish Peasant in Europe and America'', Zaniecki's most famous work written during his first U.S. stay]]
A year earlier, in 1913, Znaniecki had met [[William I. Thomas]], an American sociologist who had come to Poland in connection with his research on [[Polish-Americans|Polish immigrants in the United States]]. Thomas and Znaniecki had begun to collaborate, and soon Thomas invited Znaniecki to come to [[Chicago]] to continue work with him in the United States.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-131-134"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-14"/&gt;  In July 1914, just on the eve of [[World War I]], Znaniecki left Poland to work with Thomas as a [[research assistant]].&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-140"/&gt; From 1917 to 1919 Znaniecki also [[lecturer|lectured]] in sociology at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-185-186"/&gt;

Their work culminated in co-authoring of ''[[The Polish Peasant in Europe and America]]'' (1918–20),&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-144-144"/&gt; considered a sociology classic.&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-45"/&gt; It was his collaboration with Thomas that marked the transition in Znaniecki's career from philosopher to sociologist.&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-189"/&gt; Znaniecki stayed with Thomas in Chicago until mid-1919, when he moved to New York, following Thomas, who had lost his job at Chicago due to a [[W.I. Thomas#The "Scandal of 1918"|spurious scandal]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-164-165"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-190-191"/&gt;

That year Znaniecki published a new book, still mostly philosophical rather than sociological, ''Cultural Reality''. Published in English, it was a synthesis of his philosophical thought.&lt;ref name="Bulmer1986-50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; In New York, Thomas and Znaniecki carried on research for the [[Carnegie Corporation]] on the process of immigrant [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-190-191"/&gt; Znaniecki contributed to Thomas' book, ''Old World Traits Transplanted'', and published an anonymous solicited article on that topic to the February 1920 ''[[The Atlantic Monthly|Atlantic Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-190-191"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-192"/&gt;

===Founding Polish sociology===
[[File:Znaniecki Plaque Poznan.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Florian Znaniecki plaque, [[Adam Mickiewicz University]], [[Poznań]], Poland]]
Poland had regained independence [[end of World War I|following World War I]], in 1918. In 1919 Znaniecki contacted the newly founded [[Ministry of Religion and Education]], offering to return to Poland if the Ministry could help him secure a chair at a Polish university.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-207"/&gt; He proposed creating a novel Institute of Sociology, but bureaucracy and communication delays resulted in that idea being shelved, and he was offered a philosophy professorship at the newly organized [[Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-208-209"/&gt;

In 1920 Znaniecki returned to the newly established [[Second Polish Republic]], where at Poznań University he soon became Poland's first chair in sociology.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/&gt; He accomplished this by renaming the department, originally "Third Philosophical Department", to "Department of Sociology and Cultural Philosophy", doing the same for his chair, and establishing a  Sociological Seminary.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-211"/&gt;  That same year he also founded the [[Polish Institute of Sociology]] (''Polski Instutut Socjologiczny''), the fifth-oldest sociological institute in Europe.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-235"/&gt;

In 1927 his department was officially renamed to "department of sociology", and in 1930 the department gained authorization to issue degrees in sociology.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-213-214"/&gt; In 1930 the Polish Institute of Sociology began publishing the first Polish sociological journal, ''[[Przegląd Socjologiczny]]'' (The Sociological Review), with Znaniecki its chief editor from 1930 to 1939.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-752"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-240-241"/&gt; That year the Institute organized Poland's first academic sociologists' conference.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-243"/&gt; Due to his role as founder of so many of its building blocks,  Znaniecki is considered as one of the fathers of [[sociology in Poland]].&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;

===Late U.S. career===
Keeping in touch with American sociologists, Znaniecki lectured as a [[visiting professor]]&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-226"/&gt; at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]] in 1932–34 and during the summer of 1939.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/&gt; That summer ended the Polish stage of his career, as the German [[invasion of Poland]] and the start of World War II prevented his return to Poland.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/&gt; He was already aboard a ship bound for Poland when his travel was cut short in the [[United Kingdom]].  He still briefly considered returning to Poland, where his wife and daughter remained; however, faced with the [[occupation of Poland]], he returned to the United States, where his family eventually joined him in 1940.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-277-279"/&gt;

With help from American colleagues, Znaniecki obtained an extension of his appointment at Columbia University through mid-1940.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-280-282"/&gt; He then moved to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and in 1942 obtained American citizenship, allowing him to transition from a visiting to a regular professorship.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-284"/&gt; He taught at the University of Illinois until his retirement, deciding not to return to the communist [[People's Republic of Poland]], established in the [[aftermath of World War II]] (despite the offer of a chair at [[Poznań University]]).&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-289"/&gt; In 1950 he retired, becoming a [[professor emeritus]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-302"/&gt;

He was 44th President of the [[American Sociological Association]] (for 1954).&lt;ref name="asanet"/&gt; His presidential address, "Basic Problems of Contemporary Sociology," was delivered on 8 September 1954 at the Association's annual meeting and was later published in the [[American Sociological Review]].&lt;ref name="october"/&gt;

He died on 23 March 1958 in [[Champaign, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1986-26"/&gt; The cause of death was [[arteriosclerosis]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-370-373"/&gt; His funeral took place on 26 March, and he was buried at Roselawn Champaign Cemetery .&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-370-373"/&gt;

==Family==
In 1906 Znaniecki married a fellow Polish student at the [[University of Geneva]], Emilia Szwejkowska.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/&gt; They had a son, poet and writer [[Juliusz Znaniecki]], born 1908.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/&gt; Znaniecki's wife Emilia died in 1915.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/&gt;

Next year Znaniecki married Eileen Markley (1886–1976).&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/&gt; They had one daughter, sociologist [[Helena Znaniecki Lopata]], born 1925.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1992-238"/&gt;

==Importance==
Polish sociologist and historian of ideas [[Jerzy Szacki]] writes that Znaniecki's major contributions include: the founding of sociology in Poland; his work in [[empirical sociology]]; and his work in [[sociological theory]].&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-752"/&gt; Szacki notes that Znaniecki sought to bridge a number of gaps: between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches; between objectivity and subjectivity; between humanistic and naturalistic methodologies and viewpoints; and between American and European intellectual traditions.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/&gt;

Szacki writes that, while Znaniecki's theoretical contributions were subsequently pushed into the background by [[Talcott Parsons]]' "[[functionalism in sociology|functionalism]]",&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-753"/&gt; Znaniecki offered the most ambitious sociological theory known to America before Parsons.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/&gt;

Znaniecki's most famous work remains ''The Polish Peasant in Europe and America'' (1918–20), co-authored with [[William I. Thomas]]. His other major works include ''Wstęp do socjologii'' (An Introduction to Sociology, 1922), ''The Method of Sociology'' (1934), ''Social Actions'' (1936), ''The Social Role of the Man of Knowledge'' (1940) and ''Cultural Sciences'' (1952).&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;

==Themes==

===Empirical sociology===
Znaniecki's contributions to empirical sociology began after, and were influenced by, his collaboration with [[William I. Thomas]].&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-752"/&gt; ''The Polish Peasant in Europe and America'' (1918–20), a five-volume work which he wrote with Thomas, is considered a classic of [[empirical]] sociology.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt; It is a study of [[Poland|Polish immigrants]] to America, based on personal documents.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt; The work became a landmark study of [[Americanization (immigration)|Americanization]] — of how new immigrants to the United States "become Americans".&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-175-177"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-180-184"/&gt;

This work represents Znaniecki's most valued contribution to empirical sociology.  Most of his other works focused on theory, the only other notable exception being ''Miasto w świadomości jego obywateli'' (The City in the Consciousness of its Citizens, 1931).&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-777778"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-760"/&gt;

===Sociology: theory and definition===
A key element of Znaniecki's sociological theory is his view of sociology in particular, and of the [[social sciences]] in general, as a scientific field uniquely different from the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-250-252"/&gt; Znaniecki defines sociology as a study of [[social actions]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-250-252"/&gt; His recommended [[methodology]] was [[analytic induction]]:  analysis of typical [[case studies]], and [[generalization]] from them.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-250-252"/&gt;

Znaniecki's theories form a major part of sociology's [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]],&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-753"/&gt; and his work is a major part of the foundation of [[humanistic sociology]].&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-753"/&gt; Another term connected with Znaniecki's theories is "systematic sociology" (''"socjologia systematyczna"'').&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-759"/&gt; He sought to create a grand sociological theory, one that would bridge the gap between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-760"/&gt;

Znaniecki criticized the widespread definition of sociology as the study of [[society]].&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-766"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/&gt; In Znaniecki's culturalist perspective, sociology is a study of [[culture]] (though it is not ''the'' study of culture, as Znaniecki recognized that other social sciences also study culture).&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-763"/&gt; His definition of sociology has been described as that of "a cultural science whose function is to study systems of social interaction based upon patterns of values and norms of behaviour, through the use of the [[humanistic coefficient]]", or more simply, "the investigation of organized, interdependent interaction among human beings."&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/&gt;  The part of the culture that sociology focused on was that of [[social relation]] or interaction.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-766"/&gt;

Znaniecki saw culture as a field separate from nature, but also from individuals' perceptions.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt; The essence of culture is [[social constructivism|socially constructed]] objects.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;  He was one of the first sociologists to begin analyzing personal documents such as [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[diary|diaries]], and the like.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-775"/&gt; He considered the analysis of such documents an important part of the [[humanistic coefficient|humanistic-coefficient]] method.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;

Znaniecki saw sociology as an objective, inductive and generalizing science.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/&gt; According to Szacki,  Znaniecki viewed sociology as a [[nomothetic]] science that should be able to use a methodology similar to that of the natural sciences&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-772773"/&gt; (however, Znaniecki's daughter [[Helena Znaniecki Lopata]], in her introduction to ''Social Relations and Social Roles'', contradicts Szacki, writing that, for Znaniecki, sociology was a science "whose subject matter calls for a method different from that of the natural sciences."&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/&gt;). In 1934 he formulated the principle of [[analytic induction]], designed to identify universal propositions and causal laws.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-773774"/&gt; He contrasted it with [[enumerative research]], which provided mere correlations and could not account for exceptions in statistical relationships.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-773774"/&gt; He was also critical of the [[statistical method]], which he did not see as very useful.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-773774"/&gt;

In addition to the science of sociology, Znaniecki was also deeply interested in the larger field of the [[sociology of science]].&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt; He analyzed the [[social roles]] of scientists, and the concept of a [[school of thought]].&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;

===Four social systems===
According to Znaniecki, sociology can be divided into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-766767"/&gt; Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-766767"/&gt; Unlike [[Max Weber]], he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of [[psychology]], which he held in low esteem.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-766767"/&gt;

The four major forms of cooperative interaction, or four social systems, in growing complexity, were:
* [[social actions]] (in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''"czyny społeczne"'' or ''"czynności społeczne"''):  the most basic type of social fact;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-767"/&gt;
* [[social relations]] (in Polish, ''"stosunki społeczne"''):  these require at least two persons and a mutual obligation; the study of social relations is the study of norms regulating social actions;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-768"/&gt;
* social personalities (in Polish, ''"osoby społeczne"'' or ''"osobowości społeczne"''):  the combined picture that emerges from a number of different [[social role]]s that an individual has;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-768769"/&gt;
* social group (in Polish, ''"grupa społeczna"''):  any group which is recognized by some as a separate entity;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-770771"/&gt; Znaniecki saw a society as a group of groups, but denied it primacy as an area that the sociologist should focus on (while at the same time recognizing that most sociologists differed on this).&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-771"/&gt;

The four-category division described above appeared in his 1934 book, ''The Method of Sociology''. By 1958 he had reformulated the division, and was speaking instead of social relations, social roles, social groups, and societies.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-19"/&gt;

===Sociology of culture===
Znaniecki coined the term "[[humanistic coefficient]]" for a method of [[social research]] by way of [[data analysis]] that emphasizes participants' perceptions of the experience being analyzed.&lt;ref name="archive"/&gt; The humanistic coefficient sees all [[social fact]]s as being created by social actors and as being understandable only from their perspective.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"/&gt; Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not (objectively) as an independent observer; in other words, the scientist needs to understand the subject's world.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-761"/&gt; While some have criticized this approach as being too close to [[subjectivism]], Znaniecki himself saw it as anti-subjectivist; he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-762763"/&gt; He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-776777"/&gt; He argued that the difference between the natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied: for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-762763"/&gt;

Znaniecki characterized the world as being caught within two contrary modes of reflection; [[idealism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref name="Hałas2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999"/&gt; He proposed a third way, which he called "[[culturalism]]".&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-5253"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hałas2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StråthWitoszek1999"/&gt; His culturalism was one of the founding ideas of modern [[antipositivism|antipositivist]] and [[antinaturalism (sociology)|antinaturalist]] sociology.&lt;ref name="Sztompka2002-2425"/&gt; The term "culturalism" was introduced into English in his book, ''Cultural Reality'' (1919), and was translated into Polish as ''"kulturalizm"''; previously Znaniecki had discussed the concept in Polish as "humanism" (''"humanizm"'').&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt;

===Other themes===
Znaniecki's work also touched on many other areas of sociology, such as [[Group conflict#intergroup conflict|intergroup conflict]], [[urban sociology]], and [[rural sociology]].&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-256-259"/&gt;

==Works==
Znaniecki's first academic works, of the 1910s, were more philosophical than sociological in nature; beginning in the 1920s, his works were primarily sociological.&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-754"/&gt; His ''Cultural Reality'' (1919) was a synthesis of his philosophical thought,&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-186-187"/&gt; but the simultaneous publication of his much more popular ''The Polish Peasant in Europe and America'' (1918–20) associated his name in academic circles primarily with sociology rather than with philosophy.&lt;ref name="Dulczewski1984-189"/&gt;  His early works focused on analysis of culture and strongly criticized the principles of [[sociological naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-755757"/&gt; Szacki notes a puzzling gap in Znaniecki's research:  while he was well-read in, and engaged with, most previous and current theories, he largely ignored the works of some notable sociologists of his time such as [[Max Weber]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/&gt; On the other hand, his works engaged closely with those of [[William I. Thomas]], [[Georg Simmel]], [[Robert E. Park]], and [[Émile Durkheim]].&lt;ref name="Szacki2002-779781"/&gt;

His ''The Method of Sociology'' first introduced his concept of divisions within subfields of sociology.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/&gt; His most notable works included two books published in the same year (1952): ''Modern Nationalities'', and ''Cultural Sciences''. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences.&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/&gt; Znaniecki never finished his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''Systematic Sociology'', which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as ''Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology'' (1965).&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Znaniecki1965-12"/&gt;

'''''Hjernevask''''' ("Brainwash") is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] [[miniseries]] about [[science]] that aired on [[NRK1]] in 2010. The series, consisting of seven episodes, was created and presented by the comedian and sociologist [[Harald Eia]]. 

The series contrasted [[Cultural determinism|cultural determinist]] models of human behavior (also referred to as the [[Standard social science model]]) with nature-nurture interactionist perspectives. Experts interviewed for the series included [[Simon Baron-Cohen]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Simon LeVay]], [[David Buss]], [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]], and [[Anne Campbell (academic)|Anne Campbell]]. This ignited a wide public discussion on the subject of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Braanen, Bjørgulv|title=Hjernevask|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/57307/article/item/null/hjernevask|work=[[Klassekampen]]|date=17 March 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mikkelsen, Solveig|title= - Rammer kritisk og teoretisk tenkning|url=http://www.universitetsavisa.no/forskning/article38587.ece?device=pc|work=Universitetsavisa|publisher=[[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]]|date=25 November 2011|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NRK legger ut Eia-intervjuet|url=http://www.side2.no/underholdning/nrk-legger-ut-eia-intervjuet/2873679.html|work=Side2|publisher=[[Nettavisen]]|date=1 April 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire series has since been released online.

==Objectives and awards==
Eia and coproducer Ole Martin Ihle have named [[Steven Pinker]]'s book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' as an inspiration for the documentary series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universitas.no/kultur/54528/vasker-forskerhjerner/ |title=Vasker forskerhjerner |publisher=[[Universitas (newspaper)|Universitas]] |date=2010-02-24 |accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was a huge success, and Eia was awarded the [[Fritt Ord Award]] for "having precipitated one of the most heated debates on research in recent times".&lt;ref name="FrittOrd2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fritt-ord.no/en/hjem/mer/harald_eia_dag_hessen_og_bjorn_vassnes_far_fritt_ords_honnor/|title=Harald Eia, Dag Hessen and Bjørn Vassnes receive the Fritt Ord Foundation Tribute|date=December 8, 2010|publisher=[[Fritt Ord (organization)|The Fritt Ord Foundation]]|accessdate=September 5, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023210109/http://www.fritt-ord.no/en/hjem/mer/harald_eia_dag_hessen_og_bjorn_vassnes_far_fritt_ords_honnor/|archivedate=October 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Humanistic capitalism''' is a concept that seeks to marry [[humanism]], specifically the safety and health needs of people and the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], with an embrace of market forces and a [[market-based economy]].

[[Muhammad Yunus]] describes Humanistic Capitalism as a socially conscious business world where investors are content to recoup their investments but do not expect additional dividends. [http://www.alliancemagazine.org/online/html/aojun07e.html]
The idea of humanistic capitalism is linked with the idea that fundamental changes must take place in [[economics]] today, as humanistic capitalism requires that there be a blending of the [[non-profit]] and [[for-profit]] sectors. If investors can accept the decrease in financial returns for those on a social level, humanistic capitalism will become a successful force in driving [[economic]] and [[social change]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Philanthropy]] is a fundamental concept to humanistic capitalism. While the idea of humanistic capitalism is still growing, over “72% percent of social entrepreneurs say that raising money is a problem,” and fundraising is a major issue to social entrepreneurs, who rely on [[philanthropy]] for support and funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliancemagazine.org/online/html/aojun07e.html Caroline Hartnell]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Businesses today==
There are also many businesses today that already combine the needs of the environment with the needs of people and the environment. SustainAbility,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a company established in 1987, defines their purpose as to “seek solutions to social and environmental challenges that deliver long term value,” and has worked on projects to “identify opportunities to innovate products and services with a reduced [[environmental footprint]].” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainability.com/consultingservices/clientexperience.asp?id=1046 Client Case Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

JEP Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanisticcapitalism.com/ JEP Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the philosophies of Humanistic Capitalism to create a kinder, gentler economic approach. The principles of Just Enough Profit (JEP) are used by companies to define what they stand for, how they treat their customers and employees, and how they serve humanity.

==Other views==
In Willis Harman's seminal paper "Humanistic Capitalism: Another Alternative" (Journal of Humanistic Psychology, Vol. 14, No. 1, Winter 1974) he writes "...corporations [must] assume an active responsibility for creating a healthy society and a habitable planet&amp;mdash;not as a gesture to improve corporate image or as a moralistically undertaken responsibility, but because it is the only reasonable long-run interpretation of "good business." In the end, good business policy must become one with good social policy."

Ira Rohter, a professor in the Political Science Department at the [[University of Hawaii]], promoted Humanistic Capitalism as a way to restore power to the people of [[Hawaii]] and their environment. He advocated that all growth be [[sustainable]], [[self-reliant]], and not only focused on profit, but the needs of people. Another key concept of humanistic capitalism, he added, is a [[democracy|democratic]] economy way based on “cooperation [and] openness” in order to meet the needs of Hawaii’s people and environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~irohter/AlternativeEconomyArticle.htm Ira Rohter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4828">The [[United Nations General Assembly]] proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the '''International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World'''.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES5325"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-53-25 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=53 |accessdate=2007-08-10 |date=10 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed resolutions about the [[International Year for the Culture of Peace]] and the [[International Day of Peace]].

The action plan for the Decade proposes eight spheres of activities in which to work for the promotion of the Culture of Peace:
*To reinforce a culture of peace through [[peace education|education]]
*To promote economically and socially [[sustainable development]]
*To promote the respect of all [[human rights]]
*To ensure the [[gender equality|equality between women and men]]
*To support [[participatory democracy|democratic participation]]
*To develop comprehension, [[toleration|tolerance]] and [[solidarity]]
*To support participative communication and the [[freedom of information|freedom of movement of information]] and knowledge
*To promote international peace and safety

On 29 November 2000, the General Assembly decided to entrust [[UNESCO]] with the coordination "of the activities of the organizations of the United Nations system to promote a culture of peace, as well as liaison with other organizations concerned in this matter."{{Fact|date=August 2007}}. In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly, in a resolution on the International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-violence for the Children of the World, endorsed the ongoing work of the [[Culture of Peace News Network]] as an important part of the ongoing commitment of the [[UN]] to a culture of peace.

==NGOs==

[[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s and other civil society organizations were urged to contribute to a global movement for a culture of peace according to the Declaration and Programme of Action for a Culture of Peace, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1999.  In response, a mid-term report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/2005report.html 2005 Report of Civil Society]&lt;/ref&gt; submitted to the United Nations in 2005, included information from 700 organizations.  In 2010 at the conclusion of the Decade, the Report from the Civil Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://decade-culture-of-peace.org/2010_civil_society_report.pdf 2010 Report from the Civil Society]&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted to the United Nations with detailed information and photographs about the actions of 1,054 organizations from over 100 countries.  This information is the tip of an even larger iceberg, as indicated by the many partnerships listed by participating organizations which number in the many thousands.  

Some national NGOs coalitions promoting the Decade were established in several countries, including Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands. These national coalitions along with international organizations decided to found the [[International Coalition for the Decade]] in June 2003.

Related to this UN Decade, in December 1998, the [[World Council of Churches]] adopted, at its 8th Assembly, in Harare (Zimbabwe), the [[Decade to Overcome Violence]] as one of its programmes for the decade 2000-2009.

Sue Gilmurray from the [[Anglican Pacifist Fellowship]] composed and recorded a cycle of songs to commemorate the decade.  The songs tackle a variety of subjects, and they include a critique of the use of [[child soldiers]] and an attack on the promotion and marketing of violent films and games towards children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/JustPeace/jp253_March-April06.pdf Paxchristi.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014193404/http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/JustPeace/jp253_March-April06.pdf |date=2006-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intrinsic value''' exists wherever self-valuing beings exist &lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1996) "Forms of capital and intrinsic value," Chemosphere (1996) Vol. 33, No. 9, pp. 1801-1811. https://www.academia.edu/25475674/FORMS_OF_CAPITAL_AND_INTRINSIC_VALUES&lt;/ref&gt;. The intrinsic value of a human, or any other sentient animal, is the value it confers on itself by desiring its own lived experience as an end in itself. Because intrinsic value is self-ascribed, all animals have it, unlike instrumental or extrinsic values. Instrumental value is the value that others confer on an animal (or on any other entity) because of its value as a resource (e.g. as property, labour, food, fibre, 'ecosystem services') or as a source of emotional, recreational, aesthetic or spiritual gratification. Intrinsic values are conferred from within an animal, and are therefore not directly measurable by economists, while extrinsic values are conferred from outside and can, in principle, be measured econometrically.  

The phrase "intrinsic value" (often used synonymously with ''inherent value'') has been adopted by [[animal rights]] advocates. The Dutch ''Animal Health and Welfare Act'' referred to it in 1981: "Acknowledgment of the intrinsic value of animals means that animals have value in their own right and as a consequence their interests are no longer automatically subordinate to man's interests."&lt;ref&gt;Cock Buning, Tj. (2006). "Empirisch onderzoek naar morele oordeelsvorming bij genetische modificatie van dieren," ''NVBE Nieuwsbrief'', 13,3, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; This acknowledgement has stirred a debate on what it [[logical consequence|entails]] in the context of [[animal husbandry]], [[animal breeding]], [[vivisection]], [[animal testing]] and [[biotechnology]]. It is also used by environmental advocates and in law to holistically encompass the totality of intrinsic values in an ecosystem. Article 7(d) of New Zealand's ''Resource Management Act'' (RMA), for example, requires particular regard to be to given to "intrinsic values of ecosystems" &lt;ref&gt;New Zealand Parliament (1991) ''Resource Management Act'' http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1991/0069/latest/whole.html#DLM230267&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the moral status of animals (1880–1980) ==

Moral attitudes towards animals in the west (as expressed in public debate and legislation) have changed considerably over time. Britain's first anti-cruelty laws were introduced in the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]]. This was followed by similar laws in many other countries, especially in the second half of the 20th century. These laws did not challenge the idea that other animals are resources for human use and they only limited those acts of cruelty which (a) had few economic or social repercussions; and (b) were offensive to human sensibilities (the so-called [[Offence principle]]) or at odds with human dignity. These regulations were [[anthropocentric]] in character: they generally gave human economic and recreational interests, such as farming, fishing and blood sports, greater priority than animal suffering - that is they favoured the animals' instrumental values over their intrinsic ones. 

During the second half of the 20th century, the intensification of cattle breeding, the growth of pig and chicken factory farming and the increased use of animals in harmful laboratory experiments provoked fierce debates in which the negative consequences for the animals themselves became an issue. Notably during the 1960s and 1970s, pressure groups started to argue on behalf of the interests of animals kept in laboratories and farms. They expressed their discontent with laws that protected the institutional cruelty of the animal exploitation industries while only prohibiting selected acts of individual cruelty in certain situations. They called for new forms of legislation that would protect animals for non-[[anthropocentric]] reasons.

In these discussions (of the moral relevance of the animal's welfare) two key issues were involved. To begin with, the [[Harm principle]], rather than the [[Offence principle]], should be the moral foundation for the protection of animals. Secondly, as to the scepticism expressed by scientists regarding the presence of consciousness and self-awareness in animals, they should be granted the benefit of the doubt by adopting the so-called ''analogy postulate''. Applied [[ethology|ethological]] research into the behaviour of animals in captivity made it clear that the intensive use of animals had negative effects on the animal's health and well-being. Nevertheless, concern for the well-being of animals had to be purged from [[anthropomorphism]] and [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]]. This point of view is taken for example in a report by the Dutch Federation of Veterinarians in the EEC (FVE, 1978) concerning welfare-problems among domestic animals. This document states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
although the interests of animals often conflict with the demands of society, society remains responsible for the welfare of the animals involved. Considerations regarding animal welfare ought to be based on veterinary, scientific and ethological norms, but not on sentiment. And although animals do not have fundamental rights, human beings have certain moral obligations towards them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Intrinsic value and animal ethics (1980–2000) ==
During the 1970s and 1980s, the criticism regarding the living conditions of farm and laboratory animals became mixed up with other social debates, notably the discussions concerning the protection of the (natural) environment and the ones concerning the development of new breeding techniques. Due to this broadening of the issues, other objections against the use of animals for scientific or economic reasons emerged. The instrumental use of the animals, it was said, is hard to reconcile with their ''intrinsic'' (or ''inherent'') value. In 1981 the Dutch government included the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]-argument in a statement concerning the protection of animals (CRM, 1981). Now a principle was formulated that allowed for the possibility that, in some cases, the interests of animals might prevail over and above those of science and industry. The interests of the animal involved health and well-being as experienced by the animals themselves, independent from considerations concerning their suitability for human use. It was now claimed that animals have an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]], that is a ''good-of-their-own'', and an interest in their own well-being.

Developments within the field of biotechnology broadened the scope of the debate on the moral status of animals even more. After the controversy concerning the transgenic bull Herman and the [[lactoferrin]] project of GenePharming, modern biotechnology has almost become a synonym for [[genetic engineering]]. In the debate on bull Herman, concern for the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals became an issue in its own right. Many felt that there was more to [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] than merely the concern for the animal's welfare. Since then, [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] not only refers to the animal's welfare, but also to the moral attitude society takes towards animals (or nature) as such. For some, this stance means a return to the [[Offence principle]], and therefore not helpful in the struggle against [[anthropocentrism]] or [[anthropomorphism]]. Others however maintain that recognition of the [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals goes beyond [[animal welfare]], since it respects the animal as "centre of its own being".

== Analysis of the term ''intrinsic value'' ==
The cause of much confusion in the discussion over [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] in relation to the moral status of animals, is the diversity of meanings and connotations associated with [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]. Broadly speaking there are 4 main positions in this debate defining [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]. One can adhere to a meaning of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of animals in a sense that is:&lt;ref&gt;van der Tuuk, Edward. "Intrinsic value &amp; the struggle against anthropocentrism," in Dol, Marcel et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/l74rq21v5846474t/ ''Recognizing the Intrinsic Value of Animals''], APS, Van Gorcum, Assen, 1999, chapter 2, pp. 29–37. {{ISBN|90-232-3469-3}}&lt;!--it is the book or the article that is being referenced here?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[behaviourism|behaviouristic]], as a ''morally neutral'' value that the animal's ''own'' (hence ''intrinsic'') species-specific behaviour seeks to satisfy. Ethologists like [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] and [[Gerard Baerends]] refer in this context to [[Expectancy-value theory|expectancy-values]] (see also [[ethology]])
* [[utilitarian]], as a ''formal'' basis to grant animals ''specific'' rights, based upon the idea of [[sentience]] and ''interests'', defined by [[ethology|ethological]] knowledge, and defines corresponding human obligations (see also [[Peter Singer]]'s ideas about [[Equal consideration of interests]])
* [[deontological]], as respect for the animal's ''[[Telos (philosophy)|telos]]'' or [[Conatus|striving]] and consequential ''fundamental'' rights (see also [[Tom Regan]]'s ideas about ''inherent value'' and [[Tom_Regan#Animal_rights|animal rights]])
* [[respect|attitudinal]], as ''[[prima facie]]'' respect for all living beings, regardless of qualities like [[sentience]] (see also [[Reverence for Life]] and [[Ethical intuitionism]] and [[Moral sense theory]])

Of the first, [[behaviourism|behaviouristic]] interpretation, one can say (since it is ''morally neutral'') that it is useless to ethical theory. Of the fourth, attitudinal or intuitionistic interpretation, one can say that it is indiscriminate of sentience or interests, and could be used for any kind of (natural, cultural or abstract) entity worth protecting (including species, cultures, languages, historical buildings or sites, etc.). [[Animal_welfare#Animal_welfare_compared_with_animal_rights|The core issue in the debate over intrinsic value of animals remains between utilitarianists and deontologists]].

'''Johan Rudolph Thorbecke''' (14 January 1798 – 4 June 1872) was a Dutch statesman of [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|a liberal]] bent, one of the most important Dutch politicians of the [[19th century]]. In 1848, he virtually single-handedly drafted the revision of the [[Constitution of the Netherlands]], giving less power to the king and more to the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], and guaranteeing more religious, personal and political freedom to the people.

==Early life and education==

Thorbecke was born in [[Zwolle]]. His father Frederik Willem was a Lutheran tobacco manufacturer of German descent, while his mother Christine Regina was born in the Lower Saxon [[Osnabrück]]. Frederik Willem's business suffered badly from the [[Continental System| anti-British policies]] of the French occupiers, and his tobacco factory went bankrupt in 1803, after which he was unable to find another source of employment and would spend most of his time on the education of Johan Rudolph and his younger brother.&lt;ref name=HN&gt;{{Cite web |last=Blessing |first=Maurice |url=http://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/26817/thorbecke-romantisch-liberaal.html |title=Thorbecke: Romantisch liberaal |website=Historisch Nieuwsblad |language=Dutch |date=July 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johan Rudolph proved to be diligent and exemplary at a young age, showing intelligence and curiosity. Because of the sacrifices of his parents, who continued to struggle with financial problems, he was able to enjoy decent education.&lt;ref name=Elsevier&gt;{{Cite web|last=Van der List |first=Gerry |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/Dossiers/achtergrond/2008/9/Thorbecke-de-belangrijkste-van-allemaal-ELSEVIER202081W/ |title=Thorbecke, de belangrijkste van allemaal |website=[[Elsevier (magazine)|Elsevier]] |language=Dutch |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192720/http://www.elsevier.nl/Dossiers/achtergrond/2008/9/Thorbecke-de-belangrijkste-van-allemaal-ELSEVIER202081W/ |archivedate= 4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed primary education in his birthplace and in [[Amsterdam]], where he lived until 1806, and attended a [[Latin school]] back in Zwolle until 1814.&lt;ref name=Parlement&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parlement.com/id/vg09llalluyf/j_r_thorbecke |title=Dr.Mr. J.R.

Shortly after taking his doctorate, Thorbecke was granted a state scholarship for a journey through Germany. At [[University of Giessen|Giessen]] he lectured as an extraordinary professor, and at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], in 1824, published his treatise, ''Ueber das Wesen der Geschichte''.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Thorbecke, Jan Rudolf|volume=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would spend four years travelling, during which he was introduced to [[historism]] and [[Romanticism]], and developed emotionally and spiritually.&lt;ref name=HN/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{Cite web |last=Stevens |first=Harm |url=http://retro.nrc.nl/W2/Lab/Profiel/Grondwet/thorbecke.html |title=Een stijf Hollands heertje |website=[[NRC Handelsblad]] |language=Dutch |date=13 March 1998 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the Netherlands in 1824, he settled in [[Amsterdam]], where he wrote his first political work of significance, ''Bedenkingen aangaande het Regt en Den Staat'' ("Objections concerning the Law and the State"). The work managed to catch attention, and Thorbecke became professor of Political Science at [[Ghent University]] the following year,&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; a position he was forced to resign from due to the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830. The following year, Thorbecke became professor of Diplomacy and Modern History at the [[Leiden University]],&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; where his students would describe him as a distant, analytical mind, living a secluded life in his study.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

Originally a loyal supporter of the conservative government of [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], Thorbecke developed a more critical view of the government and indeed the autocratic system of government throughout the 1830s. His increasingly strong support for constitutional reform is shown in a series of essays he published from 1839 onward, starting with ''Aanteekening op de grondwet'', literally "Annotation on the constitution". The climax of this series was ''Over het hedendaags burgerschap'', literally "On contemporary citizenship", published in 1844, in which he argued that universal suffrage would eventually be unavoidable.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

==Political career==
{{see| Constitutional Reform of 1848}}
[[Image:TK statenpassage Thorbecke.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of Thorbecke in The Hague]]
On 21 May 1844, Thorbecke was elected into the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] for [[South Holland]].&lt;ref name=Parlement/&gt; In the House, he developed into the leader of the liberal opposition and, later that year, joined forces with eight like-minded members in a vain attempt to amend the constitution in the so-called ''Voorstel der Negenmannen'' ("Proposition of the Nine Men"). Four years later, with much of Europe convulsed by the [[Revolutions of 1848]], [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] agreed upon the formation of a committee for revision of the constitution. Thorbecke was appointed as head of this committee on 17 March. The changes were virtually all created by Thorbecke, as the other members of the committee did little but approve of his proposals. The drafted constitution was somewhat reluctantly approved by the States General, and was proclaimed on 3 November 1848.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt; The new constitution established civil rights and parliamentary competences, and introduced direct election of members of House of Representatives and [[ministerial responsibility]], thus limiting the power of the King and turning the country into a complete constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Turpijn |first=Jouke |url=http://www.historischnieuwsblad.nl/nl/artikel/24975/de-tweede-kamer-en-de-grondwet-van-1848.html |title=De Tweede Kamer en de grondwet van 1848 |website=Historisch Nieuwsblad |language=Dutch |date=January 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite initial reluctance, William II appointed Thorbecke as [[formateur]] in late October 1849, and his first cabinet took office on 13 November. In this cabinet, Thorbecke served as minister of the Interior and chaired the [[Council of Ministers (Netherlands)|Council of Ministers]], thus becoming ''de facto'' [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]]. Thorbecke's first cabinet passed several acts of particular importance, including the Electoral Act and the Province Act in 1850, and the Municipality Act in the following year.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=dbnl&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Molhuysen |first1=P.C. |last2=Blok |first2=P.J. |date=1918 |title=Nieuw Nederlandsch biografisch woordenboek. Deel 4 |trans-title=New Dutch biographic dictionary. Part 4 |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/molh003nieu04_01/molh003nieu04_01_1918.php |language=Dutch |location=Leiden |publisher=A.W. Sijthoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these successes, Thorbecke's reforms were increasingly subjected to resistance, and he was criticised for his haughtiness and his strained relationship with the King. In 1853, the [[Catholic Church]] sought to restore the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands. Common people, pastors and conservative notables showed resistance to this in an anti-papal movement known as the ''Aprilbeweging''. Thorbecke, who remained passive in the issue in defence of the [[separation of church and state]], was accused of catholic sympathies, and he was forced to resign.&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;

Thorbecke spent nine years as leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives. He pleaded for neutrality in the [[Crimean War]] 1854, and opposed the religious nature of the Primary Education Act in 1857.&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt;

The collapse of the conservative cabinet in 1862 brought Thorbecke back in power. On 31 January 1862, he started his second term as minister of the Interior and chairman of the Council of Minister.&lt;ref name=Parlement/&gt; Thorbecke's relationship with the King had improved because the focus of his reforms had shifted from politics to economics, and despite the increased disunity among the liberals, his cabinet lasted for four years because of the support of the Catholics. One of Thorbecke's first acts in his second term was the abolition of the governmental departments for religious services. Other notable achievements include the construction of several canals, the Secondary Education Act in May 1863, several acts on healthcare, and the municipal tax reform in 1865. The cabinet collapsed on 10 February 1866 and Thorbecke resigned after a conflict regarding criminal law in the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name=Elsevier/&gt;&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt;

Thorbecke returned to being leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives. In 1868, he formed the Van Bosse-Fock cabinet, but did not take part in the cabinet himself. Three years later, after this cabinet had collapsed over foreign policy, the 73-year old Thorbecke did not hesitate to start his third term.&lt;ref name=dbnl/&gt; In December 1871 fell ill, and never fully recovered. Thorbecke died at his home in [[The Hague]] on 4 June 1872, at the age of 74.&lt;ref name=NRC/&gt;

Hated by some (he was not a man of concessions), he is nowadays considered a towering figure in Dutch parliamentary history.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} There are three statues of Thorbecke (one in Amsterdam, one in The Hague and one in Zwolle) and a room in the Dutch parliament building is named after him.

Thorbecke wrote many articles on history and several newspaper articles (especially in the ''Journal de La Haye'') on topics of the day. He published a study on the [[philosophy of history]] (in German). All of his speeches in parliament have been published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2695">'''John of St Amand''', Canon of Tournay (c. 1230–1303), also known as Jean de Saint-Amand and Johannes de Sancto Amando,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jean de Saint-Amand|url=http://data.bnf.fr/13169389/jean_de_saint-amand/ |publisher=Bibliotheque Nationale de France |accessdate=4 October 2017 |ref=ISNI 0000 0000 9722 4553}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Medieval author on [[pharmacology]], teaching at the University of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bjork |first1=Robert E. |title=John of St-Amand |work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages  |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=9780199574834 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-3205}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote treatises on a variety of topics including [[magnetism]] and [[experimental method]].

==Writings==

Among St Amand's many treatises was one on the [[magnet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thorndike |first1=Lynn |title=John of St. Amand on the Magnet |journal=Isis |date=October 1946 |volume=36 |issue=3/4 |pages=156–157 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/347936}}&lt;/ref&gt; His pharmacopoeia was the ''Commentary on the Antedotary of Nicholas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brater DC, Daly WJ |title=Clinical pharmacology in the Middle Ages: principles that presage the 21st century |journal=Clin.

Like [[Roger Bacon]] (c. 1219–c. 1292)) after him, St Amand wrote on [[experimental method]]. The historian of science Lynn Thorndike explains that St Amand "asserts that experimentum alone is 'timorous and fallacious,' but that 'fortified by reason' it gives 'experimental knowledge.'" In her view, what St Amand meant was that experimentation had to be methodical, and used alongside theory. On [[Herbal|simples]] used in [[herbalism|herbal medicine]], St Amand stated specific rules for practical testing: he advised that the specimen had to be pure; that the test should be on a simple disease; that the test be repeated; and that the dose should depend on the patient. Thorndike notes that both St Amand and [[Albertus Magnus]] preceded Bacon in their use of the phrase "experimental knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thorndike |first1=Lynn |title=Roger Bacon and Experimental Method in the Middle Ages |journal=Philosophical Review |date=May 1914 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=271–298 |jstor=2178622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordán Bruno Genta''', (2 October 1909 – 27 August 1974) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] writer and educator, widely considered the ideologue of the Argentine extreme [[right-wing]].

== Career ==
In his youth, Genta actively campaigned against several attempts at [[education reform]], fearing that the changes would dilute the influence of [[Catholic]] teachings. After the [[coup d'etat]] of 4 June 1943, Genta was appointed to head the Universidad del Litoral, and gained notoriety as a defender of [[reactionary]] ideas, to the point that the popular [[FORJA]] movement and its leader [[Arturo Jauretche]] publicly condemned Genta's positions.

When Perón was [[Revolucion Libertadora|removed from power in 1955]], the armed forces were under the influence of [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas as represented by [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]] and the [[Alsogaray]] family. Some conservative circles saw Aramburu's deposing of [[Eduardo Lonardi]] as a coup against traditional Catholic values, which led to the establishment a series of right-wing movements, the most notorious of those being ''[[Alianza Libertadora Nacionalista]]'' ("Nationalist Liberation Alliance").

In 1958, another education-related fight galvanized the conservative Catholics, and new groups started forming. Most of them saw Genta as their ideological referent, and sought his advice and endorsement. Genta approved of their actions, even those that involved desecration of Jewish cemeteries or physical attacks on Jewish students.

As the 1960s brought left-wing guerrilla activity to Argentina, Genta was recognized as one of the ideologues behind ever-more violent far right groups such as [[Tacuara]]. Ironically, some of Tacuara's young recruits would later form the core of the (allegedly left-wing Peronist) [[Montoneros]] movement.

The armed struggle degenerated into the so-called [[dirty war]], which claimed thousands of lives and cast a heavy shadow over Argentine politics well into the 21st century. Genta himself would be the victim of such violence: on October 27, 1974, a [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP) guerrilla shot Genta eleven times as he was leaving his home. Genta died immediately. The gunner left the scene in a getaway car followed by two back-up vehicles. Genta was survived by his wife, two children and two grandchildren.

== Legacy ==
For many years, far right activists would congregate at Genta's grave and shout slogans such as ''Viva la muerte!'' (Long live death), inspired by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s General [[Millán Astray]], commander of the [[Spanish Legion]].

Genta's ideas were not confined to the fringes, as they influenced some sections of the military de facto governments, especially the [[National Reorganization Process]] (1976–1983). His staunch anti-communism and his contacts in the armed forces gained him some consideration from [[United States]] anti-communist operatives.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

'''Juan Antonio Nuño Montes''' ([[Madrid]], 27 March 1927 - [[Caracas]], 5 May 1995) was a philosopher, writer and university professor.

After leaving Spain in 1947, Nuño settled in Venezuela where he studied philosophy at the [[Central University of Venezuela]]. In 1951 he studied at the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Paris]]. In 1962 he finished his doctoral degree under [[Juan David García Bacca]] at the Central University of Venezuela and spent a year in Switzerland studying with [[Józef Maria Bocheński]]. He was the chair of the ''Instituto de Filosofía de la UCV'' from 1975 to 1979. In 1976 he became a member of the International Institute of Philosophy of [[Unesco]] (París). He taught at the [[Universidad Complutense]], [[University of Barcelona]], [[University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus]], [[San Marcos University]] and the [[UNAM]], where he founded the journal ''Crítica'' of the ''Instituto de investigaciones Filosóficas''.

'''KIWI''' is an application for making a wide variety of [[disk image|image sets]] for Linux supported hardware platforms as well as virtualisation systems including [[QEMU]], [[Xen]] and [[VMware]].

It is developed by the [[openSUSE Project]] and used to create [[openSUSE]] [[Linux]] but can also be employed to build a variety of other [[Linux distribution]]s.

== Usage and documentation ==
KIWI has a large amount of documentation available, organised in 'cook books' which guide new users through the process of creating increasingly complicated KIWI images.

Basic usage requires the installation of a number of tools besides KIWI, most notably for virtualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://en.opensuse.org/SDB:KIWI_Cookbook_Start_Cooking|title=Getting started with KIWI}}&lt;/ref&gt; KIWI is a command line tool and has no [[graphical user interface]].

== KIWI in use ==
KIWI is used by a variety of organizations in a variety of places. Besides [[SUSE Linux]] and the [[openSUSE Project]], [[IBM]] has a product using KIWI&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/smart-analytics-system/5710/|title=IBM system using KIWI}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2018}} and [[DELL]] employs it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/b/techcenter/archive/2010/09/13/live-image-creation-with-kiwi|title=Dell using KIWI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SUSE Studio ===
{{Main|SUSE Studio}}
SUSE Studio is a web interface ([[Ruby on Rails]]) to KIWI and the [[Open Build Service]]. It allows users to graphically put together a custom [[Linux]] [[Operating system|OS]] and generate output including a large variety of virtual machine and disk images.

'''Kah Kyung Cho''' (born 1927) is a Korean-American philosopher.&lt;ref name="PKU"/&gt; He specializes in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[hermeneutics]], contemporary German philosophy, and East-West comparative philosophy.  He has worked with continental philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]. He currently teaches at [[State University of New York]]. Cho's seminars have traditionally centered on discussions anchored in close textual and hermeneutical readings of works in the phenomenological tradition, including Heidegger's ''Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics'', ''[[Being and Time]],'' and Gadamer's ''[[Truth and Method]].''

==Education and career==
Cho graduated from [[Seoul National University]] in [[South Korea]] in 1952, and then went to the [[University of Heidelberg]] in Germany to pursue a Ph.D., completing it in 1957. He became a professor at SUNY in 1971, and since then has also served as a visiting professor at a number of institutions including the [[University of Bochum]] in Germany and [[Osaka University]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~kcho/cv/cv.htm Curriculum vitae]&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Cho was awarded the Fulbright Senior Research Professorship Award in 1961, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Grant in 1989, and 1997. 

== Philosophy ==
In his attempt to bring Asian thought to the attention of Western readers, Cho adopted a markedly different approach from that of Japanese philosophers, as Landgrebe pointed out. While most Japanese are used to relying on their own Zen Buddhist tradition as the basis for assimilating Western philosophy, Cho appealed to more original Chinese sources of Taoism and Neo-Confucianism in order to implement a much wider ranging conversation between the two traditions. The most important tool for this cross cultural research, for Cho, is Husserl's phenomenology. It is significant not only for its methodical thrust into the depth dimension of conscious and subconscious experience. Phenomenology provides, as Cho often emphasizes, the purest "optical instrument" with built-in possibilities for self-correction. If philosophy is in its essence the pursuit of self-knowledge, then the objectives for Asian philosophers are clearly mapped from the beginning. They are called upon to turn to their own traditions and engage their Western colleagues in conversations based on what they can positively contribute to sharing a higher and better level of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~kcho/profile/profile.htm|title=Kah-Kyung Cho: Personal Profile|website=www.acsu.buffalo.edu|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''legal maxim''' is an established principle or proposition of [[law]] in [[Western civilization]], and a species of [[aphorism]] and general [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]]. The word is apparently a variant of the [[Latin]] ''maxima'', but this latter word is not found in extant texts of [[Roman law]] with any denotation exactly analogous to that of a legal maxim in the Medieval or modern definition, but the treatises of many of the Roman jurists on ''regular definitiones'' and ''sententiae iuris'' are to some degree collections of maxims. Most of the Latin maxims originate from the [[Medieval era]] in European states that used [[Latin]] as their legal language.

The attitude of early [[England|English]] commentators towards the maximal of the law was one of unmingled adulation. In [[Thomas Hobbes]], ''[[Doctor and Student]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;26), they are described as of the same strength and effect in the law as statutes. Not only, observes [[Francis Bacon]] in the Preface to his [[Collection of Maxims]], will the use of maxims be in deciding doubt and helping soundness of judgment, but, further, in gracing argument, in correcting unprofitable subtlety, and reducing the same to a more sound and substantial sense of law, in reclaiming vulgar errors, and, generally, in the amendment in some measure of the very nature and complexion of the whole law.&lt;ref&gt;Combined with a tract entitled ''The Use of the Common Law, for preservation of our Persons, goods, and good Names'', in a book entitled ''The Elements of the Common Lawes of England'', facsimile reprint by Da Capo Press, 1969, may be viewed at [http://www.constitution.org/bacon/ecle.htm Constitution Society]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A similar note was sounded in [[Scotland]]; and it has been well observed that a glance at the pages of Morrisons Dictionary or at other early reports will show how frequently in the older Scots law questions respecting the rights, remedies and liabilities of individuals were determined by an immediate reference to legal maxims.

In later times, less value has been attached to the maxims of the law, as the development of [[civilization]] and the increasing complexity of business relations have shown the necessity of qualifying the propositions which they enunciate. But both historically and practically, they must always possess interest and value.

'''Linda Gordon''' is an American feminist and [[historian]].  She lives in [[New York City]] and in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. She won the [[Marfield Prize]] for ''[[Dorothea Lange]]: A Life Beyond Limits'', and the Antonovych Prize for ''Cossack Rebellions: Social Turmoil in the Sixteenth-Century Ukraine'' (SUNY Press, 1983).

==Career==
Linda Gordon was born in [[Chicago]] but considers [[Portland, Oregon]], her home town. Gordon is the daughter of William and Helen Appelman Gordon and the sister of Laurence Edward Gordon and Lee David Gordon. She is the wife of Allen Hunter and they have one daughter, Rosa Gordon Hunter, of [[Cambridge, MA]]. She graduated from [[Swarthmore College]], and from [[Yale University]] with an MA and PhD in Russian History. Her [[dissertation]] was later published as ''Cossack Rebellions''.

She taught at the [[University of Massachusetts-Boston]] from 1968 to 1984, and at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] from 1984 to 1999. The University of Wisconsin awarded her the university's most prestigious chair professorship, the Vilas Research Chair. Today, she is University Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History at [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.fas.nyu.edu/object/lindagordon|title=Department of History|website=history.fas.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon was a founding associate editor of the ''[[Journal of Women's History]]'' and serves on the advisory board of ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/journal-womens-history/editorial-board|title=Editorial Board {{!}} JHU Press|website=www.press.jhu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/about-signs/masthead/|title=Masthead|date=2012-08-22|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1970s, Gordon’s research and writing examined the historical roots of contemporary social policy debates in the US, particularly as they concern gender and family issues. Her book on these topics, ''Woman's Body, Woman's Right'' (published in 1976 and reissued in 1990), remains the definitive history of [[birth control]] politics in the US. It was completely revised and re-published in 2002 as ''The Moral Property of Women.''

In 1988 she published a historical study of how the U.S. has dealt with [[family violence]], including [[child abuse]], [[Domestic violence|spousal violence]] and [[sexual abuse]], ''Heroes of Their Own Lives'', which won the [[Joan Kelly]] prize of the [[American Historical Association]].

''Pitied But Not Entitled'', her history of [[welfare]], won the Berkshire Prize for best book in women's history and the [[Gustavus Myers]] Human Rights Award. Gordon was active with the failed campaign of a group of scholars of welfare protesting the repeal of [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] in 1996.

She served on the [[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]] during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/1996/January96/011.txt|title=Department of Justice news release, 1/23/1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing direction in the 1990s, Gordon began to explore narrative, story-telling history, as a way of bringing large-scale historical developments to life. A westerner herself, she wanted to write stories that would help to counteract the [[East Coast bias]] in the way American history has been told. Her book ''The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/01/09/reviews/000109.09lassont.html|title=Family Values, 1904 Version|last=Lassonde|first=Stephen|date=January 9, 2000|website=www.nytimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the story of a [[vigilante]] action against [[Mexican-Americans]], won the [[Bancroft Prize]] for best book in American history and the [[Beveridge Award]] for best book on the history of the [[Western Hemisphere]].

Her biography of photographer [[Dorothea Lange]] won many prizes, including: the Bancroft prize for best book in US history (making Gordon one of the very few ever to win this award twice); the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]] for Biography; and the [[National Arts Club]] prize for best arts writing, to name a few. In the process of researching that book, she discovered an important group of Lange photographs long unnoticed and never published: photographs of the [[Japanese American internment|internment]] of Japanese Americans during World War II, commissioned by the US Army but then impounded because they were too critical of the internment policy. Gordon selected 119 of these images and published them, with introductory essays by herself and by historian [[Gary Okihiro]].

In 2017, Gordon published ''The Second Coming of the KKK: The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s and the American Political Tradition.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/books/review/linda-gordon-the-second-coming-of-the-kkk.html|title=The Ku Klux Klan’s Surprising History|last=Risen|first=Clay|date=2017-12-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In philosophy, '''mystical realism''' is a view concerning the nature of the [[divinity|divine]]. The philosophical use of the term originated with the Russian philosopher [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev]] in his published article, titled "Decadentism and Mystical Realism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1907_138_4.html Decadentism and Mystical Realism]  [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Berdyaev]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two components: a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and an [[epistemological]]. 
The metaphysical component rests on a distinction between the concepts "real" and "exist".
Something exists if it:
# occupies [[space]];
# has [[matter]];
# is in [[time]];
# is affected by [[causality|causation]].
Mystical realism holds that divine entities are not accurately described in terms of space, matter, time, or causation, and so they, despite being real by the philosophy, do not exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3605">The '''National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior''' is a study of [[Human sexual activity|human sexual behavior]] conducted in the United States by the Center for Sexual Health Promotion at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University in Bloomington]]. Articles based on the study were first released in a supplement to the October, 2010 issue of ''[[Journal of Sexual Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name ="MedPage"&gt;[http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/PublicHealth/22538? "Sex in the U.S.: Survey Finds 'Enormous Diversity'"] article by Michael Smith, North American Correspondent, MedPage Today, October 04, 2010, reviewed by Adam J. Carinci, MD; Instructor, Harvard Medical School, accessed October 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The study is the first study of sexual behavior in the United States since the 1992 [[National Health and Social Life Survey]]. --&gt;

The survey, of about 6,000 subjects between the age of 14 and 94, living in the United States, showed a wide variety of sexual behavior. According to [[Debby Herbenick]], PhD, of Indiana University in Bloomington, "Adult men and women rarely engage in just one sex act when they have sex."&lt;ref name ="MedPage"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant findings include use of [[condom]]s in about 25% of instances of vaginal sex by adults, about 33% if they were single, with teenagers using condoms 70 to 80% of the time. Only a low level of sexual activity among the approximately 800 teenagers surveyed was found with incidence increasing with age. It was discovered that about one third of women reported pain during intercourse. A discrepancy was discovered between men's perception that their female partner had experienced [[orgasm]], about 85%, and women's self-reporting of 64%.&lt;ref name ="MedPage"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies were sponsored by [[Church and Dwight]] maker of [[Trojan (condoms)|Trojan condoms]]. The sponsor offered input with respect to gathering information regarding use of condoms, settling with a formulation which requested information on whether condoms were used or not during the last 10 sexual encounters of each respondent.&lt;ref name ="MedPage"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to condom use results were encouraging especially with respect to teenagers. Ethnic populations impacted by [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]] showed a higher rate of use than then general population as did dating adults. Discrepancies remain between the level of use optimal for public health and reported rate of use particularly by people over 40.&lt;ref name ="MedPage"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Women reported less satisfaction with sexual activity than men with less pleasure, less arousal, and fewer orgasms. This was hypothesized by one of the researchers as being related to the greater incidence of pain also reported by women.&lt;ref name ="MedPage"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IndicText}}

'''Naukasana''' ("Boat Pose") is a seated yoga [[asana]]. Variations include '''Paripurna Navasana''' ({{lang-sa|परिपूर्णनावासन}}; [[IAST]]: ''paripūrṇanāvāsana'' "Full Boat Pose"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/489 | title = Yoga Journal - Full Boat Pose | accessdate = 2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Ardha Navāsana''' ({{lang-sa|अर्धनावासन}} "Half Boat Pose"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yogaartandscience.com/poses/corep/ardhanav/ardhanav.html | title = Ardha Navasana (Half Boat Pose) | accessdate = 2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''ekapadanavasana''' ("one legged boat pose").

== Etymology ==

The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''nava'' meaning "boat" and ''asana'' (आसन) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Inc.1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Active Interest Media, Inc.|title=Yoga Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fekDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=25 June 2011|date=August 1996|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|page=51|issn=0191-0965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sinha|first=S.C.|title=Dictionary of Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=1 June 1996|publisher=Anmol Publications PVT. LTD.|isbn=978-81-7041-293-9|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its literal translation, "Boat Pose", the body could be imagined to resemble a boat, entirely balanced on the buttocks.

==Description==

The body comes into a V-shape, balancing entirely on the buttocks. In different variations and traditions, the arms legs and torso may take different positions. In Paripurna Navasana, the legs and back are lifted high and arms extend forward and parallel to the ground. In Arda Navasana, hands interlace behind the neck and both back and shoulders are closer to the ground.

To come into the pose, begin seated on the floor. Bend your knees, bringing the soles of the feet to the ground, and bring the palms to the back of the thighs. Begin to lean back as your shift your weight off of your feet, eventually lifting the soles of the feet off the earth all together. Balance on your seat bones, but not so far back that you're balancing on your tailbone. Lengthen the spine to broaden and lift the chest&lt;ref&gt;https://www.verywell.com/boat-pose-navasana-3567061&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Benefits ==

The asana strengthens the abdominal muscles, the legs and the lower back. Paripurna Navasana is said to relieve stress, improve digestion and aid the lower abdominal organs: kidney, intestines, and prostate for men. It can also stimulate the thyroid.It helps to improve concentration and enervates numbness in mind. It builds willpower, determination and self control.&lt;ref name="Mitchell2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Carol|title=Yoga on the ball: enhance your yoga practice using the exercise ball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8Xgqsbp_6oC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=25 June 2011|date=19 June 2003|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-0-89281-999-7|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ardha Navasana works on the upper abdominal organs: pancreas, gall bladder, spleen and liver.&lt;ref name="Hewitt1978"&gt;{{cite book

'''Nicolas d'Orbellis''' was a French [[Franciscan]] theologian and philosopher, of the [[Scotist]] school.

==Biography==
He was born about 1400. He seems to have entered the monastery of the [[Observantines]], founded in 1407, one of the first in France.
 
He appears to have been professor of theology and philosophy in the [[University of Angers]], where he enjoyed great reputation as an expounder of the teaching of [[John Duns Scotus]]. After 1465 he wrote his chief work, a commentary on the Four Books of [[Sententiae]] 'Sentences'.
 
He died at [[Rome]] in 1475 and was interred in the church of the [[Ara Coeli]] on the [[Capitoline]]. Under the entry for the word Dorbel, the Oxford English Dictionary gives the date of his death as 1455. The meaning of Dorbel (based on the name of Nicholas de Orbellis) is given as: a scholastical pedant, a dull-witted person, dolt.

==Writings==
His chief works are:
*"Expositio in IV Sententiarum Libros", a compilation based on the teachings of John Duns Scotus, published first at Rouen without date or place (s.l. et a.) and then at Rouen without the year (s. a.); at Paris, twice in 1488, again in 1499, 1511 and 1517; at Lyons, 1503; at Hagenau, 1503; Venice, 1507; 
*"Expositio in XII Libros Metaphysicae Aristotelis secundum viam Scoti" (Bologna, 1485; Paris, 1505) on [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[Metaphysics]];  
*"Expositio Logicae secundum Doctrinam Doctoris Subtilis Scoti" (Parma, 1482; Basle, 1494; Venice, 1507) on [[logic]], as the following work; 
*"Logicae Summula", with passages from [[Francis of Mayron]], [[Antonio Andrea]], [[Bonetus]] and Scotus (Venice, 1489 and 1500). 
*"Compendium Mathematicum", appeared without place or date (about 1485) (Bologna, 1485), on [[Mathematics]] like the following; 
*"De Scientia Mathematica, Physica" etc. (Basle, 1494 and 1503).

He described a series of concentric spheres each including a hierarchical organization of spirits in a setting more earth-like than theocentric.&lt;ref&gt;Carrol, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The spheres become gradually more illuminated and celestial. Spiritualists added a concept of limitlessness, or infinity to these spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it was defined that Laws initiated by God apply to earth as well as the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p.136&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common Spiritualist conception was that the spirit world is inherently good and is related to [[truth]]-seeking as opposed to things that are bad residing in a "spiritual darkness".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; This conception inferred as in the biblical parable [[Lazarus and Dives]] that there is considered a greater distance between good and bad spirits than between the dead and the living.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the spirit world is "The Home of the Soul" as described by [[C. W. Leadbeater]] ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophist]]) suggesting that for a living human to experience the spirit world is a blissful, meaningful and life changing experience.&lt;ref&gt;Colville, pp.268–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, [[John Worth Edmonds]] stated in his 1853 work, ''Spiritualism'', "Man's relation spiritually with the spirit-world is no more wonderful than his connection with the natural world. The two parts of his nature respond to the same affinities in the natural and spiritual worlds."&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted, quoting Swedenborg through mediumship, that the relationship between man and the spirit world is reciprocal and thus could contain sorrow. Though ultimately, "wandering through the spheres" a path of goodness "is received at last by that Spirit whose thought is universal love forever."&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p.345&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spomenka Hribar''' (born 25 January 1941) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[author]], [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[politician]], [[columnist]], and [[public intellectual]]. She was one of the most influential Slovenian intellectuals in the 1980s, and was frequently called "the First Lady of [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|Slovenian Democratic Opposition]]", and "the Voice of [[Slovenian Spring]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jože Pirjevec]], ''Jugoslavija: 1918-1992. Nastanek, razvoj ter razpad Karađorđevićeve in Titove Jugoslavije'' (Koper: Založba Lipa, 1995), 382-383.&lt;/ref&gt; She is married to the Slovenian [[Heidegger]]ian philosopher [[Tine Hribar]].

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2015}}
She was born '''Spomenka Diklić''' in [[Belgrade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/107884/dr-spomenka-hribar|title=Dr. Spomenka Hribar profile|publisher=Mladina.Si|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the capital of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], to a [[Serbs|Serb]] father (Radenko Diklić) and a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] mother (Marija Jelica Mravlje). Her father died at the Glavnjača prison, where the opponents of the collaborationist state of [[Milan Nedić]] were imprisoned. After World War II, she moved with her mother to [[Slovenia]], then part of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. She spent her childhood in the village of [[Žiri]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} After finishing high school in [[Škofja Loka]], she enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where she studied philosophy and sociology. She graduated in 1965 with a thesis on [[Marx]]'s concept of freedom. Between 1965-66, she was co-editor of the student magazine ''[[Tribuna (Slovenian magazine)|Tribuna]]''. Under her solicitation, the magazine became one of the first [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] student journals which also published pieces by students of theology. Among the young theologians sponsored by Hribar was also [[Anton Stres]], later [[archbishop of Ljubljana]] who shared the same scholarly interest as Hribar in the [[Marxist]] and [[Hegel]]ian conceptions of freedom.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1969, she got a job at the Institute for Sociology of the [[University of Ljubljana]]. Although a member of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Communist Party]], she grew alienated from [[Marxism]] in the 1970s. Under the influence of the literary historian [[Dušan Pirjevec]] and the philosopher [[Tine Hribar]], whom she later married, she developed an interest in the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]]. In 1975, after the poet and thinker [[Edvard Kocbek]] publicly denounced the mass killings of [[Slovene Home Guard]] members by the [[Communist regime]] after [[World War II]], she dedicated most of her intellectual endeavours to the understanding and explaining what she called the tragedy of Slovenian resistance and revolution during and after World War II.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==The public intellectual==
In the 1980s, Spomenka and her husband Tine Hribar became important members of a newly formed circle of critical Slovene intellectuals, gathered around the journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. In 1983, she started writing the essay "Guilt and Sin" (''Krivda in greh''), which became one of the most influential texts in [[post-war]] Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200934/ustavimo_spomenko_ |title=Mladina.Si |publisher=Mladina.Si|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay, meant for publishing in a collective volume on [[Edvard Kocbek]], she denounced the mass killings in Slovenia after World War II.{{Clarify|date=August 2015}}{{Clarify|date=August 2015}}

In early 1984, the essay leaked to the officials of the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]]. In September of the same year, shortly before the planned issue of the volume, the official Slovenian press launched a campaign against Spomenka Hribar, accusing her of [[counter-revolutionary]] attitudes and [[slander]] against the [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan resistance]]. In 1985, she was expelled from the Communist Party. Despite the denigration campaign, many important public figures rose to her defence, including the sociologist [[Pavle Gantar]]. In this period, she was first called "the Slovene [[Antigone]]", an [[epitome]] that has stuck to her since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revijasrp.si/knrevsrp/revsrp21/rajsh21/odmev21.htm|title=odmev21|publisher=Revijasrp.si|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, she was a co-author of the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program]], a collective text in which several Slovene public intellectuals and scholars demanded a sovereign and democratic Slovenian state.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Political activism==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2015}}
In 1989, she was one of the co-founders of the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]], one of the first [[anti-Communist]] parties in Slovenia. Together with her husband [[Tine Hribar]] and the jurists [[France Bučar]] and [[Peter Jambrek]] She became one of the party's foremost theoreticians. In the first free elections in Slovenia in April 1990, won by the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia]], she was elected to the Slovenian Parliament. Between 1990 and 1991, she was very active in the endeavours for the secession of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. Together with [[Jože Pučnik]], she emerged as the leader of the [[DEMOS coalition]] majority in the Lower Chamber of the Slovenian Parliament.

At the same time, she grew increasingly critical to the right wing of the DEMOS coalition, embodied by the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]], whom she accused of backing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and favouring their own sectarian vision of [[neo-conservative]] revisionism against the common endeavours for Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia. After the [[Ten-Day War]], Hribar turned against the conservative wing of her own party, the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The clash resulted in the split of the party between the social liberal [[Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Democratic Party]] and the liberal conservative [[National Democratic Party (Slovenia)|National Democratic Party]], which occurred in late 1991. In 1992, Hribar was among those who pushed for the dissolution of the DEMOS coalition, and backed the formation of a centre left government under the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democrat]] [[Janez Drnovšek]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Public figure after 1992==
Before the elections of 1992, Spomenka Hribar caused a famous controversy with the article "Stopping the Right Wing" (''Zaustaviti desnico'', sometimes erroneously rendered as an imperative, ''Zaustavite desnico'', that is "Stop the Right Wing!"). In the article, she warned against the rise of right wing discourse in post-independence Slovenia.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After the failure of the Democratic Party in 1992, Hribar withdrew from party politics, but remained in public life as a commentator and columnist. In her articles, she has stood up for various [[left liberal]] values in various contexts, from [[bioethics]] to immigration and integration policies.&lt;ref name="Mladina.Si"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200852/dr__spomenka_hribar__borka_za_clovekove_pravice|title=Mladina.Si|publisher=Mladina.Si|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her criticism towards the Slovenian right wing gradually brought Hribar closer to the Slovenian left wing, including then- [[President of Slovenia]] [[Milan Kučan]] and the [[Third Way (centrism)|third way]] reformist circles within the [[United List of Social Democrats]]. She frequently, however, took a more nationalist stand regarding foreign policy, especially the border disputes with neighbouring [[Croatia]].&lt;ref name="Mladina.Si"/&gt;

==Polemics with Janez Janša==
In the 1990s, Spomenka Hribar emerged as one of the strongest critics of the politician [[Janez Janša]], one of the leaders of the Slovenian right wing. The two had been close allies until 1992. In 1992, Spomenka Hribar and her husband [[Tine Hribar]] even offered Janša to take the leadership of the liberal wing of the [[Slovenian Democratic Union]]&lt;ref&gt;Tine Hribar, ''Slovenci kot nacija: soočanja s sodobniki'' (Ljubljana: Enotnost, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; However, both later accused Janša of [[populism]] and condemned his conciliatory attitude towards the conservative sections of [[Roman Catholicism in Slovenia|Slovenian Catholicism]].

Spomenka Hribar turned against Janša in 1996, denouncing his "right wing turn" and accusing him of a sectarian and paranoiac conception of politics. She later intensified her criticism, accusing him of [[authoritarianism]] and [[demagoguery]]. Differently from her husband Tine Hribar, who became more conciliatory towards Janša after 2004, seeing him as an essentially positive figure in Slovenian conservativism and implicitly supporting him in the 2004 elections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?hl=sl&amp;lr=&amp;q=tine+hribar+janez+jan%C5%A1a&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N|title=tine hribar janez janนa - Iskanje Google|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She maintained her position against the conservative politician. In 2007, she accused him of corruption and anti-democratic attitudes. Janša has accused Hribar of fostering personal animosity against his person, and stimulating a climate of [[culture war]]s in Slovenia. In Janša's view, Hribar has always had a deep disinterest in economic policies; she has failed to analyse the true power and economic relations in Slovenian society by obscuring them with both ideological mystifications and personal obsessions, thus helping the liberal economic and political establishment that has hegemonized the Slovenian public sphere since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://razgledi.net/2009/06/14/janez-jansa-o-privilegirani-upokojenki-spomenki-hribar|title=Janez Janša o privilegirani upokojenki Spomenki Hribar|publisher=Razgledi.net|date=14 June 2009|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spomenka's husband, [[Tine Hribar|Tine]], who shared her political views throughout the 1990s, has maintained a substantially positive opinion of Janša since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delo.si/clanek/100827|title=»Omreženi« sta tako levica kot desnica|publisher=Delo.si|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[youth wing]] of the [[New Slovenia]] party claimed Spomenka had collaborated with the [[State Security Administration|Yugoslav Secret Police]] (UDBA) based on a number with her name in leaked files. However, the file number is among the range associated with people that were monitored by the secret police, rather than those that collaborated with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/48123/ustavimo_spomenko_/|title=Ustavimo Spomenko!|publisher=Mladina.Si|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thermoreg}}
'''Thermolabile''' refers to a substance which is subject to destruction, [[chemical decomposition|decomposition]], or change in response to [[heat]]. This term is often used to describe [[biochemical]] substances.

For example, many bacterial [[exotoxin]]s are thermolabile and can be easily inactivated by the application of moderate heat. 
[[Enzyme]]s are also thermolabile and lose their activity when the temperature rises.
Loss of activity in such toxins and enzymes is likely due to change in the three-dimensional structure of the toxin [[protein]] during exposure to heat.
In [[pharmaceutical]] compounds, heat generated during grinding may lead to degradation of thermolabile compounds.

This is of particular use in testing [[gene]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=G|last2=Chen|first2=M|last3=Foote|first3=C|last4=Tan|first4=C|title=Temperature-sensitive mutations made easy: generating conditional mutations by using temperature-sensitive inteins that function within different temperature ranges.|journal=Genetics|date=September 2009|volume=183|issue=1|pages=13–22|pmid=19596904|doi=10.1534/genetics.109.104794|pmc=2746138}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by intentionally creating [[mutant]]s which are thermolabile. Growth below the [[permissive temperature]] allows normal protein function, while increasing the temperature above the permissive temperature ablates activity, likely by [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] the protein.

Thermolabile [[enzymes]] are also studied for their applications in [[DNA replication]] techniques, such as [[PCR]], where [[thermostable]] enzymes are necessary for proper DNA replication. Enzyme function at higher temperatures may be enhanced with [[trehalose]], which opens up the possibility of using normally thermolabile enzymes in DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermostabilization and thermoactivation of thermolabile enzymes by trehalose and its application for the synthesis of full length cDNA|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=95|pages=520-524|doi=10.1073/pnas.95.2.520|date=January 1998|first1=PIERO |last1=CARNINCI|display-authors=etal|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a4fd/1cc88fe64b474484f1d8d2910ed93053cb70.pdf|pmc=18452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Synoptic problem two source colored.png|thumb|The two-source hypothesis proposes that the authors of Matthew and Luke drew on the Gospel of Mark and a hypothetical collection of sayings of Jesus known as Q.]]

The '''two-source hypothesis''' (or '''2SH''') is an explanation for the [[synoptic problem]], the pattern of similarities and differences between the three Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. It posits that the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Luke]] were based on the [[Gospel of Mark]] and a hypothetical sayings collection from the [[oral gospel traditions|Christian oral tradition]] called [[Q document|Q]].

The two-source hypothesis emerged in the 19th century. [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter]] definitively stated the case in 1924, adding that two other sources, referred to as [[M-Source|M]] and [[L source|L]], lie behind the material in Matthew and Luke respectively. The strengths of the hypothesis are its [[explanatory power]] regarding the shared and non-shared material in the three gospels; its weaknesses lie in the exceptions to those patterns, and in the hypothetical nature of its proposed collection of Jesus-sayings. Later scholars have advanced numerous elaborations and variations on the basic hypothesis, and even completely alternative hypotheses. Nevertheless, "the 2SH commands the support of most biblical critics from all continents and denominations."&lt;ref&gt;Montserrat, Joan. 16 June 2005. Two-Source Hypothesis. URL: http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/09/two-source-hypothesis.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Streeter's two additional sources, M and L, are taken into account, this hypothesis is sometimes referred to as the [[four-document hypothesis]].

== History ==

The two-source hypothesis was first articulated in 1838 by [[Christian Hermann Weisse]], but it did not gain wide acceptance among German critics until [[Heinrich Julius Holtzmann]] endorsed it in 1863. Prior to Holtzmann, most Catholic scholars held to the [[Augustinian hypothesis]] (Matthew → Mark → Luke) and Protestant biblical critics favored the [[Griesbach hypothesis]] (Matthew → Luke → Mark). The Two-Source Hypothesis crossed the channel into England in the 1880s primarily due to the efforts of [[William Sanday (theologian)|William Sanday]], culminating in [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter's]] definitive statement of the case in 1924. Streeter further argued that additional sources, referred to as [[M-Source|M]] and [[L source|L]], lie behind the material in Matthew and Luke respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Burnett Hillman Streeter, ''The Four Gospels, a Study of Origins treating of the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, &amp; Dates'', (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration'' (Oxford Un. Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background: the synoptic problem ==

The hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the [[synoptic problem]]: the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three [[synoptic gospels]], Matthew, Mark and Luke. The answer to this problem has implications for the order in which the three were composed, and the sources on which their authors drew.

Any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features:
*The "triple tradition": The three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of "pericopes" (incidents, stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called "synoptic", or seeing-together). Where they differ on this shared material, Mark and Luke will agree against Matthew, or Mark and Matthew will agree against Luke, but very rarely will Mark be the odd one out. Matthew's and Luke's versions of shared pericopes will usually be shorter than Mark's.
*The "double tradition": Sometimes Matthew and Luke share material which is not present in Mark. In these cases Matthew and Luke sometimes parallel each other closely, but at other times are widely divergent.&lt;ref name="mindspring"&gt;[http://www.mindspring.com/~scarlson/synopt/2sh/index.htm "The Two-Source Hypothesis", Mindspring.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515022301/http://www.mindspring.com/~scarlson/synopt/2sh/index.htm |date=15 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of the hypothesis ==

The 2SH attempts to solve the synoptic problem by advancing two propositions, Markan priority to explain the triple tradition, and the existence of a lost [[Q document]] to solve the double tradition. In summary, the two-source hypothesis proposes that Matthew and Luke used Mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of Jesus' life; and that Matthew and Luke use a second source, Q (from German [[Quelle document|Quelle]], “source”), not extant, for the sayings (logia) found in both of them but not in Mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/biblical-literature/The-two-and-four-source-hypotheses#ref598087 Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marcan priority ===
{{Main|Marcan priority}}
The 2SH explains the features of the triple tradition by proposing that both Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source. Mark appears more 'primitive': his diction and grammar are less literary than Matthew and Luke, his language is more prone to redundancy and obscurity, his [[Christology]] is less supernatural, and he makes more frequent use of [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]]. The more sophisticated versions of Mark's pericopes in Matthew and Luke must be either the result of those two "cleaning up" Mark, if his is the first gospel, or of Mark "dumbing down" Matthew and/or Luke, if he was later. Critics regard the first explanation as the more likely. On a more specific level, Marcan priority seems to be indicated due to instances where Matthew and Luke apparently omit explanatory material from Mark, where Matthew adds his own theological emphases to Mark's stories, and in the uneven distribution of Mark's stylistic features in Matthew.&lt;ref name="synop"&gt;[http://www.hypotyposeis.org/synoptic-problem/2004/09/two-source-hypothesis.html "The Two-Source Hypothesis", Synoptic Problem Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The existence of Q ===
{{Main|Q source}}
The 2SH explains the double tradition by postulating the existence of a lost "sayings of Jesus" document known as Q, from the German ''Quelle'', "source". It is this, rather than Markan priority, which forms the distinctive feature of the 2SH as against rival theories. The existence of Q follows from the conclusion that, as Luke and Matthew are independent of Mark in the double tradition, the connection between them must be explained by their joint but independent use of a missing source or sources. (That they used Q independently of each other follows from the fact that they frequently differ quite widely in their use of this source).&lt;ref name="synop"/&gt;

== Problems with the hypothesis ==
While the 2SH remains the most popular explanation for the origins of the synoptic gospels, two questions, the existence of the so-called "minor agreements", and problems with the hypothesis of Q, continue at the centre of discussion over its explanatory power.

=== The minor agreements ===

The "minor agreements"—the word "minor" here is not intended to be belittling—are those points where Matthew and Luke agree against Mark (for example, the mocking question at the beating of Jesus, "Who is it that struck you?", found in both Matthew and Luke but not in Mark). The "minor agreements" thus call into question the proposition that Matthew and Luke knew Mark but not each other. Streeter devoted a chapter to the matter, arguing that the Matthew/Luke agreements were due to coincidence, or to the result of the two authors' reworking of Mark into more refined Greek, or to overlaps with Q or oral tradition, or to textual corruption.

A few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to Luke's using Matthew in addition to Q and Mark ([[Three-source hypothesis|3SH]]). But the modern argument for Q requires Matthew and Luke to be independent, so the 3SH raises the question of how to establish a role for Q if Luke is dependent on Matthew. Accordingly, some scholars (like [[Helmut Koester]]&lt;!-- "Ancient Christian Gospels" --&gt;) who wish to keep Q while acknowledging the force of the minor agreements attribute them to a proto-Mark, such as the Ur-Markus in the Markan Hypothesis (MkH), adapted by Mark independently from its use by Matthew and Luke. Still other scholars feel that the minor agreements are due to a revision of our Mark, called deutero-Mark. In this case, both Matthew and Luke are dependent on proto-Mark, which did not survive the ages.

"Therefore, the minor agreements, if taken seriously, force a choice between accepting pure Markan priority on one hand or the existence of Q on the other hand, but not both simultaneously as the 2SH requires."&lt;ref name="mindspring"/&gt;

=== Problems with Q ===
A principal objection to the 2SH is that it requires a hypothetical document, Q, the existence of which is not attested in any way, either by existing fragments (and a great many fragments of early Christian documents do exist) or by early Church tradition. The minor agreements are also, according to the critics, evidence of the non-existence of, or rather the non-necessity for, Q: if Matthew and Luke have passages which are missing in Mark (the "Who is it that struck you?" sentence quoted above is a famous example), this demonstrates only that Matthew is quoting Luke or vice versa.

Two additional problems are noteworthy, the "problem of fatigue" and the Q narrative problem. The first relates to the phenomenon that a scribe, when copying a text, will tend to converge on his source out of simple fatigue. Thus Mark calls Herod by the incorrect title ''basileus'', "king", throughout, while Matthew begins with the more correct ''tetrarches'' but eventually switches to ''basileus''. When similar changes occur in double tradition material, which according to the 2SH are the result of Matthew and Luke relying on Q, they usually show Luke converging on Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Goodacre |authorlink=Mark Goodacre |date=10 January 2003 |title=Ten Reasons to Question Q |work=The Case Against Q website |url=http://ntgateway.com/Q/ten.htm |accessdate=2009-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015182345/http://ntgateway.com/Q/ten.htm |archivedate=15 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierson Parker in 1940 suggested that the non-canonical [[Gospel of the Hebrews]] was the second source used in the Gospel of Luke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pierson Parker |date=Dec 1940 |title= A Proto-Lucan basis for the Gospel according to the Hebrews|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature |volume= 59 |pages=471–478|jstor= 3262407 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is yet to gain influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Andrew |title=Prior or Posterior? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=51:3:344–360''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

The two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century: Mark as the earliest gospel, Matthew and Luke written independently and reliant on both Mark and the hypothetical Q.
In 1924 [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter]] refined the ''Two Document Hypothesis'' into the [[Four Document Hypothesis (Synoptic problem)|Four Document Hypothesis]] based on the possibility of a Jewish M source (see the [[Gospel according to the Hebrews]]).

While the standard two-source theory holds Mark and Q to be independent, some argue that Q was also a source for Mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mark and Q: A Study of the Overlap Texts | last=Fleddermann | first=Harry T. | year=1995 | isbn=906186710X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes called the ''Modified two-document hypothesis'' (although that term was also used in older literature to refer to the Four-document hypothesis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Two Shipwrecked Gospels: The Logoi of Jesus and Papias’s Exposition of Logia about the Lord | last=MacDonald | first=Dennis R. |author-link=Dennis R. MacDonald | year=2012 | pages=73–75 | isbn=158983691X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars have suggested a [[Three-source hypothesis]], that Luke actually did make some use of Matthew after all. This allows much more flexibility in the reconstruction of Q.

Dunn proposes an ''Oral Q'' hypothesis, in which Q is not a document but a body of oral teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Oral Gospel Tradition | last=Dunn | first=James D. G. | year=2013 | pages=80–108 | isbn=0802867820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other hypotheses==
Some form of the Two Source hypothesis continues to be preferred by a majority of New Testament scholars as the theory that is best able to resolve the synoptic problem. Nevertheless, doubts about the problems of the minor agreements and, especially, the hypothetical Q, have produced alternative hypotheses.

In 1955 a British scholar, A. M. Farrer, proposed that one could dispense with Q by arguing that Luke revised both Mark and Matthew. In 1965 an American scholar, William R. Farmer, also seeking to do away with the need for Q, revived an updated version of Griesbach's idea that Mark condensed both Matthew and Luke. In Britain, the most influential modern opponents of the 2SH favor the [[Farrer hypothesis]], while Farmer's revised Griesbach hypothesis, also known as the Two Gospel hypothesis, is probably the chief rival to the Two Source hypothesis in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtualreligion.net/forum/complete.html Jesus Seminar: The Synoptic Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, the German theologian Christian Gottlob Wilke argued for a solution that combined Marcan priority with an extensively developed argument for Matthew’s direct dependence upon both Mark and Luke. Thus, like Farrer, Wilke's hypothesis has no need for Q, but it simply reverses the direction of presumed dependence between Matthew and Luke proposed by Farrer. A few other German scholars supported Wilke's hypothesis in the nineteenth century, but in time most came to accept the two-source hypothesis, which remains the dominant theory to this day. The [[Wilke hypothesis]] was accepted by Karl Kautsky in his Foundations of Christianity&lt;ref&gt;Karl Kautsky Foundations of Christianity&lt;/ref&gt; and has begun to receive new attention in recent decades since its revival in 1992 by Huggins,&lt;ref&gt;Huggins, Ronald V. (1992). "Matthean Posteriority: a Preliminary Proposal". Novum Testamentum. 34 (1): 1–22. doi:10.1163/156853692X00131. JSTOR 1561093. Reprinted in Huggins, Ronald V. (1999).

The Myth of the Lost Gospel. {{ISBN|0977048608}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is represented by the [[Augustinian hypothesis]], which is that the four gospels were written in the order in which they appear in the bible (Matthew → Mark → Luke), with Mark a condensed edition of Matthew. This hypothesis was based on the claim by the 2nd century AD bishop Papias that he had heard that Matthew wrote first. By the 18th century the problems with Augustine's idea led [[Johann Jakob Griesbach]] to put forward the [[Griesbach hypothesis]], which was that Luke had revised Matthew and that Mark had then written a shorter gospel using material on which both Matthew and Luke agreed (Matthew → Luke → Mark).

A variant of the Augustinian hypothesis, attempting to synchronise Matthew and Mark on the basis of the Mosaic "two witnesses" requirement of Deuteronomy 19:15 (Matthew + Mark, → Luke), was proposed by [[Eta Linnemann]], following rejection of the view of her teacher [[Rudolf Bultmann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2184">'''William Manderstown''' (c.1485–1552, also spelled ''Manderston'') was a Scottish philosopher and [[Rector of the University of Paris]].

==Life==

He was born in the [[diocese of St. Andrews]], probably at the town of [[Manderston]], [[Stirlingshire]]. Educated apparently at St. Andrews, he then attended the [[University of Paris]], where he graduated licentiate in medicine, and became one of the school of [[Terminists]] (at whose head was [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]]). On 15 December 1525, he succeeded [[Jean Tixier de Ravisi]] as rector of the University of Paris. Before 1539 he returned to Scotland, where he and John Mair co-founded a bursary or chaplaincy in St. Salvator's, and endowed it with the rents of houses in South Street, St. Andrews. On 3 April in the same year, Manderstown witnessed a charter at [[Dunfermline Monastery]]. He also served as rector in [[Gogar, Edinburgh|Gogar]].

==Works==
In 1519, with [[George Lokert]] and [[Gervasius Waim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.scholasticon.fr/Database/Scholastiques_fr.php?ID=1264 ''Scholasticon'' page]&lt;/ref&gt; he edited the ''Quaestiones ac decisiones physicales'' of [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]].

In 1518 Manderstown published at Paris two works, ''Bipartitum in Morali Philosophia Opusculum'', dedicated to [[Andrew Forman]], and ''Tripartitum Epithoma Doctrinale''; in the latter he was later said to have plagiarised from [[Jérôme de Hangest]]. Besides these, [[Thomas Tanner (bishop)|Thomas Tanner]] attributes to Manderstown: 1. ''In Ethicam Aristotelis ad Nicomachum Comment''; 2. ''Quæstionem de Futuro Contingenti''; 3. ''De Arte Chymica''.

{{Zen Buddhism}}
{{Japanese Buddhism}}

The {{Nihongo|'''Ōbaku-shū'''|黄檗宗|}} is one of several schools of [[Zen]] in [[Japanese Buddhism]], in addition to [[Sōtō]] and [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]].

==History==
Often termed the third sect of [[Zen Buddhism]] in [[Japan]], Ōbaku-shū was established in 1661 by a small faction of masters from [[China]] and their Japanese students at [[Manpuku-ji]] in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]], Japan.

Today Manpuku-ji serves as the Ōbaku's head temple, with 420 subtemples spread throughout Japan as of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Dougill, 78&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their contribution to the culture of Zen in Japan, the Ōbaku also "disseminated many aspects of [[Ming period|Ming-period]] culture" in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, et al.; 98&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the monks who came from China were accomplished [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphers]], and Obaku's founder [[Yinyuan Longqi]] and two other Ōbaku masters, [[Mokuan Shōtō]] and [[Sokuhi Nyoitsu]], became known as the [[Ōbaku no Sanpitsu]] (or, the "Three Brushes of Ōbaku"). Author [[Steven Heine]] writes, "Areas where the influence of — or the reaction to — Ōbaku left an imprint on [[Japanese Buddhism]] is manifold, and its impact even reached the fields of Japanese cultural techniques, such as printing and painting.&lt;ref name="heine"&gt;Heine, 255&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chinese medicine]] and architecture were also introduced, as was the practice of "[[spirit writing]]", the latter practiced by Ōbaku monks who were said to communicate with [[Chen Tuan]].&lt;ref name="haskel"&gt;Haskel, 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Rooted in the lineage (school) of [[Linji school|Linji]], and therefore sharing a familial relationship with the [[Rinzai school|Rinzai-shū]] of Japan, the Ōbaku's approach to practice is today tinged with a hint of Chinese influence. More narrowly, Ōbaku abbots are now all from the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, the same as Rinzai, and thus practices are largely similar, though this was not the case originally. Historically, the Ōbaku-shū has sometimes been referred to as "[[Nembutsu]] Zen"—a derogatory characterization intended to describe their use of "Zen and [[Pure Land]] practices."&lt;ref&gt;Obaku Zen; 87&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen J. Baroni]] writes that today, "With a few notable exceptions, such as the style of sutra chanting (which continues to be done in an approximation of [[Fujian]] dialect), Ōbaku temples and monasteries appear very like their Rinzai neighbors."&lt;ref&gt;Iron Eyes; 6&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically the smallest school/sect of Zen in modern-day Japan, the Ōbaku is also like the [[Rinzai school|Rinzai-shū]] in that it is known to be more conservative and intellectually inclined than the [[Sōtō|Sōtō-shū]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nagasaki Kofukuji M5667.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Meditation Hall]] at [[Kōfuku-ji]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]]]
The development of the Ōbaku-shū in Japan began somewhere around 1620, a period when Chinese emigrants were coming to [[Nagasaki]] due to a decree by the [[shogunate]] allowing Chinese traders to conduct business there. The Chinese traders, in turn, began to request that monks from China come to Nagasaki "to serve the religious needs of their community and build monasteries in the late-Ming style with which they were familiar."&lt;ref name="zenclassics"&gt;Zen Classics; 151&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese community was therefore thrilled when the founder of the Ōbaku, a master of the Linji school/sect named [[Yinyuan Longqi]] (J. ''Ingen Ryūki''), arrived from China in Nagasaki in 1654 with a small group of his [[China|Chinese]] students. Furthermore, Yinyuan himself was happy to get away from China, which was then amidst a terrible war.&lt;ref name="zenclassics"/&gt; Yinyuan was there with the explicit purpose of helping three underdeveloped temples founded by Chinese emigrants grow in the city. These Nagasaki temples were known as the three "temples of good fortune," respectively [[Kōfuku-ji]], Fukusai-ji and [[Sōfuku-ji (Nagasaki)|Sōfuku-ji]].&lt;ref name="dumoulin"&gt;Dumoulin, 299-356&lt;/ref&gt; In time many Japanese heard of his teachings and traveled to Nagasaki to see him, some of whom came to join his community and become a student.&lt;ref name="baroni"&gt;Iron Eyes; 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Having planned to stay in Japan for a short period of time, Yinyuan was persuaded by a group of his Japanese students to remain in Japan; this group got him governmental permission to relocate to [[Kyoto]], where his student Ryūkai Shōsen wished he would then become abbot of the [[Rinzai]] temple [[Myoshin-ji]]. Authorities within the Rinzai organization were not keen on this idea, the divide stemming primarily from a disagreement within the congregation as to whether or not Yinyuan presented a take on Zen that was too distinctly Chinese for Japanese tastes.&lt;ref name="dumoulin"/&gt; As a consequence, Yinyuan began construction of the modern day head temple of the Ōbaku known as [[Manpuku-ji|Ōbaku-san Manpuku-ji]] in 1661 in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] of [[Kyoto prefecture]] (Ōbaku-san being the mountain name). This marks the emergence of the Ōbaku school/sect of Zen Buddhism in Japan.&lt;ref name="baroni"/&gt;

Construction was completed in 1669, the [[Ōbaku Zen architecture|architecture]] done in the [[China|Chinese]] [[Ming dynasty]] style. By authorization of the local [[bakufu]] leaders (i.e. [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]]&lt;ref&gt;Totman; 404&lt;/ref&gt;), the Ōbaku-shu emerged to help revitalize Rinzai practice in Japan. The practice at Manpuku-ji was different from that in other Rinzai temples and monasteries of Japan during this period, much more Chinese in its approach. Yinyuan brought with him aspects of [[esoteric Buddhism]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism]]. As [[Heinrich Dumoulin]] puts it, "For Zen practice in general, seated meditation and the practice of [[kōan]] are central, while cultic ceremony is of secondary importance. Insofar as the Ōbaku belonged to the Rinzai tradition, ''[[zazen]]'' and kōan practice were made part of daily life, but ritual was also accorded a place of considerable importance."&lt;ref name="dumoulin"/&gt; Furthermore, Ōbaku monasteries and temples came to be governed by a doctrine known as ''Ōbaku shingi'', which both imported Chinese practices such as the recitation ([[dharani]]) of [[nembutsu]] and "sought to preserve the Chinese character of the group."&lt;ref name="baroni"/&gt; The Ōbaku also chanted [[sutra]]s derived from the [[Pure Land Buddhism]] sect set to Chinese music.&lt;ref name="dumoulin"/&gt;

[[Image:NagasakiSofukuji2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Meditation Hall]] at [[Sōfuku-ji (Nagasaki)|Sōfuku-ji]] in [[Nagasaki]]]]
After Yinyuan's retirement in 1664&lt;ref name="weidner"&gt;Weidner, 293&lt;/ref&gt; and death in 1673, other monks who had come to [[Japan]] around the same time as he helped to carry on the tradition of practice at [[Manpuku-ji]]. The foremost of his disciples was [[Mokuan Shōtō]], who became 2nd abbot of Manpuku-ji in 1664. During its formative years, Manpuku-ji was very popular in Japan with many adherents coming to the temple for instruction.&lt;ref name="dumoulin"/&gt; According to the book ''Latter Days of the Law'', "For the next century, Manpuku-ji was headed by Chinese immigrant monks, and they sent their Japanese followers to found other temples. Obaku Zen quickly spread through the country."&lt;ref name="weidner"/&gt; At least one abbot of [[Manpuku-ji]] during this period of early Obaku history proved to be controversial. His name was Tu-chan Hsing-jung (Dokutan Shōtei), and he served as 4th abbot of Manpuku-ji. Critics charge that he took his emphasis on [[nembutsu]] recitation at Manpuku-ji too far, and he is today derisively nicknamed "Nembutsu Dokutan".&lt;ref&gt;Obaku Zen; 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most important Ōbaku practitioner besides Yinyuan Longqi was [[Tetsugen Dōkō]], a Japanese man who lived from 1630 to 1682. Tetsugen is remembered for having transcribed the entire [[Ming period]] Chinese [[Tripitaka]] to [[Woodcut|woodblock]]s—known as the ''Tetsugen-ban'' or ''Ōbaku-ban'' (''ban'' meaning edition).&lt;ref&gt;Obaku Zen; 82&lt;/ref&gt; Raised as part of the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] of Japan, Tetsugen first met Yinyuan in 1655 at [[Kōfuku-ji]] in Nagasaki and eventually came to join the Ōbaku.&lt;ref name="dumoulin"/&gt; The first Japanese abbot of Mampuku-ji assumed leadership of the Ōbaku in 1740, a man by the name of Ryūtō Gentō. From 1786 on through to modern day, the Ōbaku has been run and controlled by exclusively Japanese leadership.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Portrait of Ingen Ryūki by Kita Genki.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Chinese monk Yinyuan ([[Ingen]]), who founded the Ōbaku school]]
[[File:Mampukuji.jpg|thumb|[[Manpuku-ji]] in [[Kyoto, Japan]]]]

Monastic practices of the Ōbaku-shū were once largely informed by the ''Ōbaku shingi'' (or, ''Ōbaku codes''), composed in 1672 with ten sections outlining the practice regimen at [[Manpuku-ji]]. [[Steven Heine]] writes that, "The text reflected a few evolutionary changes that had taken place in Chinese monasteries since the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan,]] but it was squarely in the tradition of classical rules of purity such as the ''Chanyuan qingui'' and ''Chixiu baizhang qingqui''."&lt;ref name="zenclassics"/&gt; The [[Rinzai]] branch [[Myōshin-ji]] authored their own set of monastic regulations (penned by Mujaku Dōchū)&lt;ref name="classics2"/&gt; in response to this later in 1685.&lt;ref name="heine"/&gt; To be sure, Myoshinji was worried about losing students to the Ōbaku, who were growing in popularity. The Ōbaku's "emphasis on the [[pratimoksa|precepts]] and the strict observance of monastic regulations embodied in ''Ōbaku shingi'' seem to have stimulated and encouraged certain Japanese masters of similar bent. In the Sōtō sect, for example, the Chinese teachers influenced the monastic codes of reformers like [[Gesshū Sōko]] and Manzan Dōhaku who had studied under Ōbaku masters."&lt;ref name="haskel"/&gt;

The Ōbaku-shū emphasized the taking of various precepts and also observed the [[Vinaya]] of the [[Dharmaguptaka]] tradition as well as [[sutra]] translation. But perhaps most obvious to the Japanese was their use of ''[[Nianfo|nembutsu]]''&lt;ref&gt;Baskind, 19-34&lt;/ref&gt; and also their use of the "''nembutsu [[kōan]]''" which entailed the practice of reciting the name of [[Amitabha]] while holding in one's mind the kōan, "Who is reciting?"&lt;ref name="zenclassics"/&gt; While foreign to the Japanese (despite this "dual practice" being introduced in Japan as early as the late 13th century),&lt;ref&gt;Obaku Zen; 112&lt;/ref&gt; this was very common in [[Ming period]] Ch'an, where there was no sectarian divide between [[Pure Land]] Buddhists and Ch'an practitioners. Author Steven Heine writes:&lt;ref name="classics2"&gt;Zen Classics; 151-152&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... regardless of its inclusion of Pure Land elements, the fact remained that the Ōbaku school, with its group practice of zazen on the platforms in a meditation hall and its emphasis on keeping the precepts, represented a type of communal monastic discipline far more rigorous than anything that existed at the time in Japanese Buddhism.}}

As a result of their approach, many Rinzai and Sōtō masters undertook reforming and revitalizing their own monastic institutions, such as Rinzai master Ungo Kiyō who even began implementing the use of ''nembutsu'' into his training regimen at [[Zuigan-ji]].&lt;ref name="classics2"/&gt; T. Griffith Foulk writes:&lt;ref&gt;Kraft; 165&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The followers of [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (1687—1769) tried to purge the elements of Ōbaku Zen they found objectionable. They suppressed the Pure Land practice of reciting [[Amitābha|Amida]] Buddha's name, deemphasized the Vinaya, and replaced sutra study with a more narrow focus on traditional koan collections.}}

Specifically, starting under the leadership of chief abbot Ryochu Nyoryu 良忠如隆 (1793–1868), Zen practice largely became the same as Rinzai practice, but monastic and cultural differences remain. Additionally, Buddhist sutras in the Ōbaku-shū continue today to be chanted in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd; 365&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ōbaku school is also well known for its style of [[vegetarian]] cooking known as {{nihongo||普茶料理|fucha ryōri}}, its version of [[Buddhist cuisine]] (in Japan known as {{nihongo||精進料理|shōjin ryōri|devotion cuisine}}). This is similar to usual ''shōjin ryōri,'' but with more Chinese influence. It was introduced by Yinyuan and his group, and served at the main temple of Manpuku-ji,&lt;ref&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/head_temples/02manpuku.html]&lt;/ref&gt; along with various subtemples such as [[Kanga-an]].&lt;ref&gt;Coldicott 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kangaan.jp/kyofutya.html 京懐石普茶料理], [http://www.kangaan.jp 閑臥庵] {{ja-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ōbaku school also introduced to Japan and practices a variant of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]] which uses [[sencha]] leaf tea, rather than the more usual [[matcha]] powdered tea – see [[sencha tea ceremony]].

==Notable temples==

===Head temple===
*[[Manpuku-ji]] &amp;ndash; Construction began in 1661 and concluded in 1669. Located in [[Kyoto]], Manpuku-ji serves as the head temple of the Ōbaku school. It provides a "rare example" of a temple built in a purely [[China|Chinese]] [[Ming period]] [[architectural]] style in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="rowthorn"&gt;Rowthorn, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtemples===
*[[Fukusai-ji]] &amp;ndash; Founded in 1628 in [[Nagasaki]] and later destroyed in 1945, Fukusai-ji has since been reconstructed in the shape of a turtle with an 18-metre high [[aluminum alloy]] statue of [[Kannon]], the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion. The interior is famous for the 25-metre [[Foucault Pendulum]] which swings over the remains of 16,500 Japanese killed during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="dodd"&gt;Dodd, 722&lt;/ref&gt;
