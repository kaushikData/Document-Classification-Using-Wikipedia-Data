      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2867">In the mathematical theory of [[Kleinian group]]s, the '''Ahlfors finiteness theorem''' describes the quotient of the domain of discontinuity by a finitely generated Kleinian group. The theorem was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Lars Ahlfors|first=Lars |last=Ahlfors|year1=1964|year2=1965}}, apart from a gap that was filled by {{harvtxt|Greenberg|1967}}.

The Ahlfors finiteness theorem  states that if Γ is a finitely-generated Kleinian group  with region of discontinuity Ω, then
Ω/Γ has a finite number of components, each of which is a compact Riemann surface with a finite number of points removed.

==Bers area inequality==

The '''Bers area inequality''' is a quantitative refinement of the Ahlfors finiteness theorem proved by {{harvs|first=Lipman|last=Bers|authorlink=Lipman Bers|txt|year=1967a}}. It states that if Γ is a non-elementary finitely-generated Kleinian group with ''N'' generators and with region of discontinuity Ω, then
:Area(&amp;Omega;/&amp;Gamma;) &amp;le; 4&amp;pi;(''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)
with equality only for [[Schottky group]]s. (The area is given by the Poincaré metric in each component.)
Moreover, if Ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is an invariant component then
:Area(&amp;Omega;/&amp;Gamma;) &amp;le; 2Area(&amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&amp;Gamma;)
with equality only for [[Fuchsian group]]s of the first kind (so in particular there can be at most two invariant components).

[[File:Asymptote02 vectorial.svg|right|thumb|200px|A curve intersecting an asymptote infinitely many times.]]
In [[analytic geometry]], an '''asymptote''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|ɪ|m|p|t|oʊ|t}}) of a [[curve]] is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the ''x'' or ''y'' coordinates [[Limit of a function#Limits at infinity|tends to infinity]]. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://rowdy.msudenver.edu/~talmanl/PDFs/APCalculus/OnAsymptotes.pdf "Asymptotes" by Louis A. Talman]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[projective geometry]] and related contexts, an asymptote of a curve is a line which is [[tangent]] to the curve at a [[point at infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An elementary treatise on the differential calculus|chapter=Asymptotes|first=Benjamin|last=Williamson|url=https://books.google.com/?id=znsXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=241|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jeffrey|last=Nunemacher|title=Asymptotes, Cubic Curves, and the Projective Plane|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=72|issue=3|year=1999|pages=183–192|jstor=2690881|doi=10.2307/2690881|citeseerx=10.1.1.502.72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word asymptote is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀσύμπτωτος (''asumptōtos'') which means "not falling together", from ἀ [[Privative alpha|priv.]] + σύν "together" + πτωτ-ός "fallen".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced by [[Apollonius of Perga]] in his work on [[conic sections]], but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Smith, ''History of Mathematics, vol 2'' Dover (1958) p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three kinds of asymptotes: ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes. For curves given by the graph of a function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}}, horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to {{nowrap|+&amp;infin; or &amp;minus;&amp;infin;.}}  Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines near which the function grows without bound. An oblique asymptote has a slope that is non-zero but finite, such that the graph of the function approaches it as ''x'' tends to {{nowrap|+&amp;infin; or &amp;minus;&amp;infin;.}}

More generally, one curve is a ''curvilinear asymptote'' of another (as opposed to a ''linear asymptote'') if the distance between the two curves tends to zero as they tend to infinity, although the term ''asymptote'' by itself is usually reserved for linear asymptotes.

Asymptotes convey information about the behavior of curves ''in the large'', and determining the asymptotes of a function is an important step in sketching its graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Apostol | first1=Tom M. | author1-link=Tom M. Apostol | title=Calculus, Vol. 1: One-Variable Calculus with an Introduction to Linear Algebra | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=New York | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-471-00005-1 | year=1967}}, §4.18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study of asymptotes of functions, construed in a broad sense, forms a part of the subject of [[asymptotic analysis]].

==Introduction==
[[File:Hyperbola one over x.svg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\tfrac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; graphed on [[Cartesian coordinates]]. The ''x'' and ''y''-axes are the asymptotes.]]
The idea that a curve may come arbitrarily close to a line without actually becoming the same may seem to counter everyday experience. The representations of a line and a curve as marks on a piece of paper or as pixels on a computer screen have a positive width. So if they were to be extended far enough they would seem to merge, at least as far as the eye could discern. But these are physical representations of the corresponding mathematical entities; the line and the curve are idealized concepts whose width is 0 (see [[Line (geometry)|Line]]). Therefore, the understanding of the idea of an asymptote requires an effort of reason rather than experience.

Consider the graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; shown to the right. The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form &lt;math&gt;\left(x, \frac{1}{x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; where x is a number other than 0. For example, the graph contains the points (1, 1), (2, 0.5), (5, 0.2), (10, 0.1), … As the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; become larger and larger, say 100, 1,000, 10,000 …, putting them far to the right of the illustration, the corresponding values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, .01, .001, .0001, …, become infinitesimal relative to the scale shown. But no matter how large &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; becomes, its reciprocal &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; is never 0, so the curve never actually touches the ''x''-axis. Similarly, as the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; become smaller and smaller, say .01, .001, .0001, …, making them infinitesimal relative to the scale shown, the corresponding values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, 100, 1,000, 10,000 …, become larger and larger. So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the ''y''-axis. Thus, both the ''x'' and ''y''-axes are asymptotes of the curve. These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a [[Limit of a function|limit]] in mathematics, and this connection is explained more fully below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference for section: [https://books.google.com/books?id=HTwi2M37rQAC&amp;pg=PA541 "Asymptote"] ''[[Penny Cyclopædia|The Penny Cyclopædia]]'' vol. 2, The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight and Co., London p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymptotes of functions==
The asymptotes most commonly encountered in the study of [[calculus]] are of curves of the form {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}}. These can be computed using [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and classified into ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes depending on their orientation. Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &amp;minus;∞. As the name indicates they are parallel to the ''x''-axis. Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines (perpendicular to the ''x''-axis) near which the function grows without bound. Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines such that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &amp;minus;∞. 

===Vertical asymptotes===
The line ''x'' = ''a'' is a ''vertical asymptote'' of the graph of the function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}} if at least one of the following statements is true:

# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a^{-}} f(x)=\pm\infty,&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a^{+}} f(x)=\pm\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a^-}&lt;/math&gt; is the limit as ''x'' approaches the value ''a'' from the left (from lesser values), and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to a^+}&lt;/math&gt; is the limit as ''x'' approaches ''a'' from the right.

For example, if ƒ(''x'') = ''x''/(''x''–1), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as ''x'' approaches 1. So
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 1^{+}}\frac{x}{x-1}=+\infty&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 1^{-}}\frac{x}{x-1}=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and the curve has a vertical asymptote ''x''=1. 

The function ''ƒ''(''x'') may or may not be defined at ''a'', and its precise value at the point ''x'' = ''a'' does not affect the asymptote.  For example, for the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{x} &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 0, \\ 5 &amp; \text{if  } x \le 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

has a limit of +∞ as {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;rarr; 0&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''ƒ''(''x'') has the vertical asymptote  {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}, even though ''ƒ''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5. The graph of this function does intersect the vertical asymptote once, at (0,5). It is impossible for the graph of a function to intersect a vertical asymptote (or [[vertical line test|a vertical line in general]]) in more than one point. Moreover, if a function is [[continuous function|continuous]] at each point where it is defined, it is impossible that its graph does intersect any vertical asymptote.

A common example of a vertical asymptote is the case of a rational function at a point x such that the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.

If a function has a vertical asymptote, then it isn't necessarily true that the derivative of the function has a vertical asymptote at the same place. An example is
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) =  \tfrac 1x + \sin(\tfrac 1x)\quad&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\quad x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

This function has a vertical asymptote at &lt;math&gt;x=0,&lt;/math&gt; because 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to0^+}\left(\tfrac 1x + \sin\left(\tfrac 1x\right)\right) = +\infty,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to0^-} f(x) = \lim_{x\to0^-}\left(\tfrac 1x + \sin\left(\tfrac 1x\right)\right) = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The derivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the function
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=\frac{-(\cos(\tfrac 1x) + 1)}{x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the sequence of points
:&lt;math&gt;x_n=\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)\pi},\quad&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\quad n=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

that approaches  &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; both from the left and from the right, the values &lt;math&gt;f'(x_n)&lt;/math&gt; are constantly &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, both [[one-sided limit]]s of &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; can be neither &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; doesn't have a vertical asymptote at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Horizontal asymptotes===
[[File:Asymptote03.png|right|frame|The graph of a function can have two horizontal asymptotes. An example of such a function would be &lt;math&gt;y=\arctan(x).&lt;/math&gt;]]

''Horizontal asymptotes'' are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;rarr; ±&amp;infin;}}.  The horizontal line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of the function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x'') if
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(x)=c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow +\infty}f(x)=c&lt;/math&gt;.
In the first case, ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' as asymptote when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞, and in the second ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' as an asymptote as ''x'' tends to +∞

For example, the arctangent function satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}\arctan(x)=-\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\arctan(x)=\frac{\pi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

So the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &amp;minus;&amp;pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞, and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &amp;pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to +∞.

Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions. For example, the function {{nowrap|1=ƒ(''x'') = 1/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1)}} has a horizontal asymptote at ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when ''x'' tends both to &amp;minus;∞ and +∞ because, respectively,

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to -\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=\lim_{x\to +\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Oblique asymptotes===
[[File:1-over-x-plus-x.svg|right|thumb|220px|In the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+\tfrac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, the ''y''-axis (''x'' = 0) and the line ''y'' = ''x'' are both asymptotes.]]
When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis, it is called an ''oblique asymptote'' or ''slant asymptote''. A function ''f''(''x'') is asymptotic to the straight line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} (''m''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0) if

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0 \, \mbox{ or } \lim_{x \to -\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the first case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞, and in the second case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ(x)'' when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞.

An example is ƒ(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' + 1/''x'', which has the oblique asymptote ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' (that is ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) as seen in the limits
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[f(x)-x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)-x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{x}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Elementary methods for identifying asymptotes ==
The asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits).

===General computation of oblique asymptotes for functions===

The oblique asymptote, for the function ''f''(''x''), will be given by the equation ''y''=''mx''+''n''. The value for ''m'' is computed first and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;m\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)/x&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is either &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; depending on the case being studied. It is good practice to treat the two cases separately. If this limit doesn't exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction.

Having ''m'' then the value for ''n'' can be computed by

:&lt;math&gt;n\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}(f(x)-mx)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' should be the same value used before. If this limit fails to exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction, even should the limit defining ''m'' exist. Otherwise {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is the oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') as ''x'' tends to ''a''.

For example, the function {{nowrap|1=''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') = (2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''x'' + 1)/''x''}} has

:&lt;math&gt;m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x^2}=2&lt;/math&gt; and then
:&lt;math&gt;n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\left(\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x}-2x\right)=3&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 2''x'' + 3}} is the asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞.

The function {{nowrap|1=''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') = ln ''x''}} has

:&lt;math&gt;m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x}=0&lt;/math&gt; and then

:&lt;math&gt;n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\ln x&lt;/math&gt;, which does not exist.

So {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ln ''x''}} does not have an asymptote when ''x'' tends to +∞.

=== Asymptotes for rational functions ===
A [[rational function]] has at most one horizontal asymptote or oblique (slant) asymptote, and possibly many vertical asymptotes.

The [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of the numerator and degree of the denominator determine whether or not there are any horizontal or oblique asymptotes. The cases are tabulated below, where deg(numerator) is the degree of the numerator, and deg(denominator) is the degree of the denominator.

|}

The vertical asymptotes occur only when the denominator is zero (If both the numerator and denominator are zero, the multiplicities of the zero are compared). For example, the following function has vertical asymptotes at ''x'' = 0, and ''x'' = 1, but not at ''x'' = 2.
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^2-5x+6}{x^3-3x^2+2x}=\frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{x(x-1)(x-2)}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Oblique asymptotes of rational functions ====
[[File:SlantAsymptoteError.svg|right|thumb|320px|Black: the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(x^2+x+1)/(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Red: the asymptote &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;. Green: difference between the graph and its asymptote for &lt;math&gt;x=1,2,3,4,5,6&lt;/math&gt;]]

When the numerator of a rational function has degree exactly one greater than the denominator, the function has an oblique (slant) asymptote. The asymptote is the polynomial term after [[Polynomial long division|dividing]] the numerator and denominator. This phenomenon occurs because when dividing the fraction, there will be a linear term, and a remainder. For example, consider the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^2+x+1}{x+1}=x+\frac{1}{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;
shown to the right. As the value of ''x'' increases, ''f'' approaches the asymptote ''y'' = ''x''. This is because the other term,  1/(''x''+1), approaches 0.

If the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator, and the denominator does not divide the numerator, there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as ''x'' increases, but the quotient will not be linear, and the function does not have an oblique asymptote.

=== Transformations of known functions ===
If a known function has an asymptote (such as ''y''=0 for ''f''(x)=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;), then the translations of it also have an asymptote.
* If ''x''=''a'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''x''=''a''+''h'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''-''h'')
* If ''y''=''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''c''+''k'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x'')+''k''

If a known function has an asymptote, then the [[Homothetic transformation|scaling]] of the function also have an asymptote.

* If ''y''=''ax''+''b'' is an asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''cax''+''cb'' is an asymptote of ''cf''(''x'')
For example, ''f''(''x'')=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''-1&lt;/sup&gt;+2 has horizontal asymptote ''y''=0+2=2, and no vertical or oblique asymptotes.

== General definition ==
[[File:Graph of sect csct.svg|right|thumb|200px|(sec(t), cosec(t)), or x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (xy)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with 2 horizontal and 2 vertical asymptotes.]]

Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a [[parametric curve|parametric]] plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')).  Suppose that the curve tends to infinity, that is:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow b}(x^2(t)+y^2(t))=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
A line ℓ is an asymptote of ''A'' if the distance from the point ''A''(''t'') to ℓ tends to zero as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Pogorelov | first1=A. V. | title=Differential geometry | publisher=P. Noordhoff N. V. | location=Groningen | series=Translated from the first Russian ed. by L. F. Boron | mr=0114163 | year=1959}}, §8.&lt;/ref&gt; From the definition, only  open  curves  that  have  some  infinite branch can have an asymptote. No closed curve can have an asymptote.

For example, the upper right branch of the curve ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' can be defined parametrically as ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''t'' (where ''t'' &gt; 0). First, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ and the distance from the curve to the ''x''-axis is 1/''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞. Therefore, the ''x''-axis is an asymptote of the curve. Also, ''y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0 from the right, and the distance between the curve and the ''y''-axis is ''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. So the ''y''-axis is also an asymptote. A similar argument shows that the lower left branch of the curve also has the same two lines as asymptotes.

Although the definition here uses a parameterization of the curve, the notion of asymptote does not depend on the parameterization. In fact, if the equation of the line is &lt;math&gt;ax+by+c=0&lt;/math&gt; then the distance from the point ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')) to the line is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|ax(t)+by(t)+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
if γ(''t'') is a change of parameterization then the distance becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|ax(\gamma(t))+by(\gamma(t))+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
which tends to zero simultaneously as the previous expression.

An important case is when the curve is the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a [[real function]] (a function of one real variable and returning real values). The graph of the function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x'') is the set of points of the plane with coordinates (''x'',''ƒ''(''x'')). For this, a parameterization is
:&lt;math&gt;t\mapsto (t,f(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
This parameterization is to be considered over the open intervals (''a'',''b''), where ''a'' can be &amp;minus;∞ and ''b'' can be +∞.

An asymptote can be either vertical or non-vertical (oblique or horizontal). In the first case its equation is ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', for some real number ''c''. The non-vertical case has equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}}, where ''m'' and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers. All three types of asymptotes can be present at the same time in specific examples.  Unlike asymptotes for curves that are graphs of functions, a general curve may have more than two non-vertical asymptotes, and may cross its vertical asymptotes more than once.

==Curvilinear asymptotes==
[[File:nonlinear asymptote.svg|right|thumb|200px|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''+3 is a parabolic asymptote to (''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+3''x''+4)/''x'']]
Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a parametric plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')), and ''B'' be another (unparameterized) curve. Suppose, as before, that the curve ''A'' tends to infinity. The curve ''B'' is a curvilinear asymptote of ''A'' if the shortest distance from the point ''A''(''t'') to a point on ''B'' tends to zero as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''b''.  Sometimes ''B'' is simply referred to as an asymptote of ''A'', when there is no risk of confusion with linear asymptotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fowler|first=R. H.|title=The elementary differential geometry of plane curves|publisher=Cambridge, University Press|year=1920|url=https://archive.org/details/elementarydiffer00fowlrich|isbn=0-486-44277-2|hdl=2027/uc1.b4073882}}, p. 89ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x^3+2x^2+3x+4}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has a curvilinear asymptote {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x'' + 3}}, which is known as a ''parabolic asymptote'' because it is a [[parabola]] rather than a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;William Nicholson, ''The British enciclopaedia, or dictionary of arts and sciences; comprising an accurate and popular view of the present improved state of human knowledge'', Vol. 5, 1809&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymptotes and curve sketching==
Asymptotes are used in procedures of [[curve sketching]]. An asymptote serves as a guide line to show the behavior of the curve towards infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, P. ''An elementary treatise on curve tracing'' (1918) [https://archive.org/details/elementarytreati00fros online]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get better approximations of the curve, curvilinear asymptotes have also been used &lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R. H. ''The elementary differential geometry of plane curves'' Cambridge, University Press, 1920, pp 89ff.([https://archive.org/details/elementarydiffer00fowlrich online at archive.org])&lt;/ref&gt; although the term [[asymptotic curve]] seems to be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, P. ''An elementary treatise on curve tracing'', 1918, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebraic curves==
[[File:Folium Of Descartes.svg|thumb|right|A [[cubic curve]], [[Folium of descartes|the folium of Descartes]] (solid) with a single real asymptote (dashed).]]
The asymptotes of an [[algebraic curve]] in the [[affine space|affine plane]] are the lines that are tangent to the [[algebraic curve#Projective curves|projectivized curve]] through a [[point at infinity]].&lt;ref&gt;C.G. Gibson (1998) ''Elementary Geometry of Algebraic Curves'', § 12.6 Asymptotes, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-64140-3}},&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one may identify the [[unit hyperbola#Asymptotes|asymptotes to the unit hyperbola]] in this manner. Asymptotes are often considered only for real curves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Coolidge | first1=Julian Lowell | title=A treatise on algebraic plane curves | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York | mr=0120551 | year=1959 | isbn=0-486-49576-0}}, pp. 40&amp;ndash;44.&lt;/ref&gt; although they also make sense when defined in this way for curves over an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Kunz | first1=Ernst | title=Introduction to plane algebraic curves | publisher=Birkhäuser Boston | location=Boston, MA | isbn=978-0-8176-4381-2 | mr=2156630 | year=2005}}, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

A plane curve of degree ''n'' intersects its asymptote at most at ''n''&amp;minus;2 other points, by [[Bézout's theorem]], as the intersection at infinity is of multiplicity at least two.  For a [[conic]], there are a pair of lines that do not intersect the conic at any complex point: these are the two asymptotes of the conic.

A plane algebraic curve is defined by an equation of the form ''P''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 where ''P'' is a polynomial of degree ''n''
:&lt;math&gt;P(x,y) = P_n(x,y) + P_{n-1}(x,y) + \cdots + P_1(x,y) + P_0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] of degree ''k''.  Vanishing of the linear factors of the highest degree term ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defines the asymptotes of the curve: setting {{math|1=''Q'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, if {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'' &amp;minus; ''by'') ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'')}}, then the line
:&lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)x+Q'_y(b,a)y + P_{n-1}(b,a)=0&lt;/math&gt;
is an asymptote if &lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q'_y(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; are not both zero. If  &lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)=Q'_y(b,a)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{n-1}(b,a)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is no asymptote, but the curve has a branch that looks like a branch of parabola. Such a branch is called a '''{{vanchor|parabolic branch}}''', even when it does not have any parabola that is a curvilinear asymptote. If &lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)=Q'_y(b,a)=P_{n-1}(b,a)=0,&lt;/math&gt; the curve has a singular point at infinity which may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches.

Over the complex numbers, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; splits into linear factors, each of which defines an asymptote (or several for multiple factors).  0ver the reals, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; splits in factors that are linear or quadratic factors. Only the linear factors correspond to infinite (real) branches of the curve, but if a linear factor has multiplicity greater than one, the curve may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches. It may also occur that such a multiple linear factor corresponds to two complex conjugate branches, and does not corresponds to any infinite branch of the real curve.  For example, the curve {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 = 0}} has no real points outside the square &lt;math&gt; |x|\leq 1, |y|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, but its highest order term gives the linear factor ''x'' with multiplicity 4, leading to the unique asymptote ''x''=0.

==Asymptotic cone==
{{col-begin}}
[[File:Conic section hyperbola.gif|thumb|Hyperbolas, obtained cutting the same right circular cone with a plane and their asymptotes.]]
The [[hyperbola]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}= 1&lt;/math&gt;
has the two asymptotes
:&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\frac{b}{a}x.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation for the union of these two lines is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the [[hyperboloid]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;
is said to have the '''asymptotic cone'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YMU0AAAAMAAJ L.P. Siceloff, G. Wentworth, D.E. Smith ''Analytic geometry'' (1922) p. 271]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fGg4AAAAMAAJ P. Frost ''Solid geometry'' (1875)] This has a more general treatment of asymptotic surfaces.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The distance between the hyperboloid and cone approaches 0 as the distance from the origin approaches infinity.
{{col-end}}

More generally, let us consider a surface that has an implicit equation
&lt;math&gt;P_d(x,y,z)+P_{d-2}(x,y,z) + \cdots P_0=0,&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[homogeneous polynomial]]s of degree &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{d-1}=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the equation &lt;math&gt;P_d(x,y,z)=0&lt;/math&gt; defines a [[cone]] which is centered at the origin. It is called an '''asymptotic cone''', because the distance to the cone of a point of the surface tends to zero when the point on the surface tends to infinity.

E. H. Love''', was a mathematician famous for his work on the mathematical theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. He also worked on wave propagation and his work on the structure of the Earth in ''Some Problems of Geodynamics'' won for him the [[Adams prize]] in 1911 when he developed a mathematical model of surface waves known as [[Love wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Love}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=31354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/34603 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Love also contributed to the theory of [[tidal locking]] and introduced the parameters known as [[Love number]]s, which are widely used today. These numbers are also used in problems related to the tidal deformation of the Earth due to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun.

He was educated at [[Wolverhampton Grammar School]] and in 1881 won a scholarship to [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he was at first undecided whether to study classics or mathematics. His successful progress (he was placed [[Second Wrangler]])&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=LV882AE|name=Love, Augustus Edward Hough}}&lt;/ref&gt; vindicated his choice of mathematics, and in 1886 he was elected Fellow of the college. In 1899 he was appointed [[Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy]] in the [[University of Oxford]], a position which he retained until his death in 1940. He was also a Fellow of [[Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College]].

He authored the two volume classic, ''[[q:A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity|A Treatise on the Mathematical Theory of Elasticity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Augustus E. Love |title=A treatise on the mathematical theory of elasticity |publisher=Dover |location=Mineola, N.Y |year=1944 |pages= |isbn=0-486-60174-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His other awards include the [[Royal Society]] Royal Medal in 1909 and  [[Sylvester Medal]] in 1937,  the [[London Mathematical Society]]  [[De Morgan Medal]] in 1926. He was secretary to the London Mathematical Society  between 1895 and 1910, and president for 1912–1913.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3299">In [[mathematics]], the '''Birkhoff–Grothendieck theorem''' classifies [[holomorphic vector bundle|holomorphic]] [[vector bundle]]s over the complex [[projective line]]. In particular every holomorphic vector bundle over &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{CP}^1 &lt;/math&gt; is a direct sum of holomorphic [[line bundle]]s. The theorem was proved by {{harvs|txt|last=Grothendieck|first=Alexander | authorlink=Alexander Grothendieck|year=1957|loc=Theorem 2.1}}, and is more or less equivalent to  [[Birkhoff factorization]] introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Birkhoff|first=George David| year=1909|authorlink=George David Birkhoff}}.

==Statement==

More precisely, the statement of the theorem is as the following.

Every [[holomorphic vector bundle]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{CP}^1 &lt;/math&gt; is holomorphically isomorphic to a direct sum of line bundles:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E}\cong\mathcal{O}(a_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus \mathcal{O}(a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

The notation implies each summand is a [[Serre twist]] some number of times of the [[trivial bundle]]. The representation is unique up to permuting factors.

== Generalization ==
The same result holds in algebraic geometry for [[algebraic vector bundle]] over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^1_k&lt;/math&gt; for any field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''CIKS-1''' is a [[block cipher]] designed in 2002 by A.A. Moldovyan and N.A. Moldovyan. Like its predecessor, [[Spectr-H64]], it relies heavily on [[permutation]]s of bits, so is better suited to implementation in hardware than in software.

The algorithm has a [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 64 bits. It uses an 8 round structure in which half of the block determines the transformation of the other half in each round, similar to a [[Feistel cipher]] or [[RC5]]. In each round the [[key (cryptography)|key]] also undergoes a transformation dependent on the data. CIKS-1 uses four types of operations: data-dependent permutations, fixed permutations, [[XOR]]s, and [[modular arithmetic|addition mod 4]].

The designers of CIKS-1 didn't specify any [[key schedule]] for the cipher, but it uses a total [[key size]] of 256 bits. Kidney, Heys, and Norvell showed that round keys of low [[Hamming weight]] are relatively [[weak key|weak]], so keys should be chosen carefully. The same researchers have also proposed a [[differential cryptanalysis]] of CIKS-1 which uses 2&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt; chosen plaintexts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9510">In [[mathematics]], at the junction of [[singularity theory]] and [[differential topology]], '''Cerf theory''' is the study of families of smooth real-valued functions

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon M \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;

on a [[smooth manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, their generic singularities and the topology of the subspaces these singularities define, as subspaces of the function space. The theory is named after [[Jean Cerf]], who initiated it in the late 1960s.

== An example ==

[[Marston Morse]] proved that, provided &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is compact, any [[Smoothness|smooth function]]

:&lt;math&gt;f\colon M \to \Bbb R&lt;/math&gt;

could be approximated by a [[Morse theory|Morse function]]. So for many purposes, one can replace arbitrary functions on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; by Morse functions.

As a next step, one could ask, 'if you have a 1-parameter family of functions which start and end at Morse functions, can you assume the whole family is Morse?'  In general the answer is no.  Consider, for example, the family:

:&lt;math&gt;f_t(x)=(1/3)x^3-tx&lt;/math&gt;

as a 1-parameter family of functions on &lt;math&gt;M=\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. 
At time

:&lt;math&gt;t=-1&lt;/math&gt;

it has no critical points, but at time

:&lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;

it is a Morse function with two critical points

:&lt;math&gt;x=\pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Cerf showed that a 1-parameter family of functions between two Morse functions could be approximated by one that is Morse at all but finitely many degenerate times.  The degeneracies involve a birth/death transition of critical points, as in the above example when &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; an index 0 and index 1 critical point are created (as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; increases).

== A ''stratification'' of an infinite-dimensional space ==

Let's return to the general case that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a compact manifold. Let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Morse}(M)&lt;/math&gt; denote the space of Morse functions

:&lt;math&gt;f \colon M \to \mathbb R\,&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Func}(M)&lt;/math&gt; the space of smooth functions

:&lt;math&gt;f \colon M \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

Morse proved that

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Morse}(M) \subset \operatorname{Func}(M)&lt;/math&gt;

is an open and dense subset in the &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt; topology.

For the purposes of intuition, here is an analogy. Think of the Morse functions as the top-dimensional open stratum in a [[Topologically stratified space|stratification]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Func}(M)&lt;/math&gt; (we make no claim that such a stratification exists, but suppose one does). Notice that in stratified spaces, the [[co-dimension]] 0 open stratum is open and dense. For notational purposes, reverse the conventions for indexing the stratifications in a stratified space, and index the open strata not by their dimension, but by their co-dimension. This is convenient since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Func}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is infinite-dimensional if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is not a finite set. By assumption, the open co-dimension 0 stratum of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Func}(M)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Morse}(M)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Func}(M)^0=\operatorname{Morse}(M)&lt;/math&gt;. In a stratified space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, frequently &lt;math&gt;X^0&lt;/math&gt; is disconnected. The '''essential property''' of the co-dimension 1 stratum &lt;math&gt;X^1&lt;/math&gt; is that any path in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which starts and ends in &lt;math&gt;X^0&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated by a path that intersects &lt;math&gt;X^1&lt;/math&gt; transversely in finitely many points, and does not intersect &lt;math&gt;X^i&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus Cerf theory is the study of the positive co-dimensional strata of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Func}(M)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Func}(M)^i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. In the case of

:&lt;math&gt;f_t(x)=x^3-tx&lt;/math&gt;,

only for &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; is the function not Morse, and

:&lt;math&gt;f_0(x)=x^3&lt;/math&gt;

has a cubic [[degenerate critical point]] corresponding to the birth/death transition.

== A single time parameter, statement of theorem ==

The [[Morse theory#The Morse lemma|Morse Theorem]] asserts that if &lt;math&gt;f \colon M \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a Morse function, then near a critical point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; it is conjugate to a function &lt;math&gt;g \colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; of the form

:&lt;math&gt;g(x_1,x_2,\dotsc,x_n) = f(p) + \epsilon_1 x_1^2 + \epsilon_2 x_2^2 + \dotsb + \epsilon_n x_n^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i \in \{\pm 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Cerf's 1-parameter theorem asserts the '''essential property''' of the co-dimension one stratum.

Precisely, if &lt;math&gt;f_t \colon M \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a 1-parameter family of smooth functions on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_0, f_1&lt;/math&gt; Morse, then there exists a smooth 1-parameter family &lt;math&gt;F_t \colon M \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;F_0 = f_0, F_1 = f_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is uniformly close to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;C^k&lt;/math&gt;-topology on functions &lt;math&gt;M \times [0,1] \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.  Moreover, &lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt; is Morse at all but finitely many times.  At a non-Morse time the function has only one degenerate critical point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and near that point the family &lt;math&gt;F_t&lt;/math&gt; is conjugate to the family

:&lt;math&gt;g_t(x_1,x_2,\dotsc,x_n) = f(p) + x_1^3+\epsilon_1 tx_1 + \epsilon_2 x_2^2 + \dotsb + \epsilon_n x_n^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_i \in \{\pm 1\}, t \in [-1,1]&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1 = -1&lt;/math&gt; this is a 1-parameter family of functions where two critical points are created (as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; increases), and for &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; it is a 1-parameter family of functions where two critical points are destroyed.

== Origins ==

The [[Piecewise linear manifold|PL]]-[[Jordan-Schönflies theorem|Schoenflies problem]] for &lt;math&gt;S^2 \subset \mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt; was solved by [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]] in 1924. His proof was adapted to the [[Smooth manifold|smooth]] case by Morse and [[Emilio Baiada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Morse|first1=Marston|authorlink1=Marston Morse| last2=Baiada|first2= Emilio|authorlink2=Emilio Baiada|title=Homotopy and homology related to the Schoenflies problem| 
journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=2|volume=58|year=1953|pages= 142–165|mr=0056922|doi=10.2307/1969825}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The '''essential property''' was used by Cerf in order to prove that every orientation-preserving [[diffeomorphism]] of [[3-sphere|&lt;math&gt;S^3&lt;/math&gt;]] is isotopic to the identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jean|last=Cerf|authorlink=Jean Cerf|title= Sur les difféomorphismes de la sphère de dimension trois (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_4=0&lt;/math&gt;)|series= Lecture Notes in Mathematics|volume=53| publisher=Springer-Verlag|location= Berlin-New York|year= 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; seen as a 1-parameter extension of the Schoenflies theorem for &lt;math&gt;S^2 \subset \mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;. The corollary [[Exotic sphere|&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_4 = 0&lt;/math&gt;]] at the time had wide implications in differential topology. The '''essential property''' was later used by Cerf to prove the [[Pseudoisotopy theorem|pseudo-isotopy theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jean|last=Cerf|authorlink=Jean Cerf|title= La stratification naturelle des espaces de fonctions différentiables réelles et le théorème de la pseudo-isotopie|journal= [[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]] |volume=39 |year=1970|pages=5–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; for high-dimensional simply-connected manifolds.  The proof is a 1-parameter extension of Smale's proof of the [[h-cobordism|h-cobordism theorem]] (the rewriting of Smale's proof into the functional framework was done by Morse, also Milnor,&lt;ref&gt;J. Milnor, Lectures on the h-cobordism theorem, Notes by L.Siebenmann and J.Sondow, Princeton Math. Notes 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and also by Cerf-Gramain-Morin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/surgery/cerf-gramain.pdf Le theoreme du h-cobordisme (Smale)] Notes by Jean Cerf and Andre Gramain (Ecole Normale Superieure, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; following a suggestion of Thom).

Cerf's proof is built on the work of Thom and Mather.&lt;ref&gt;J. Mather,  Classification of stable germs by R-algebras, Publ. Math. IHES (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  A useful modern summary of Thom and Mather's work from the period is the book of Golubitsky and Guillemin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marty Golubitsky|M. Golubitsky]], V.Guillemin.  Stable Mappings and Their Singularities. Springer-Verlag Graduate Texts in Mathematics 14 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Beside the above-mentioned applications, Robion Kirby used Cerf Theory as a key step in justifying the [[Kirby calculus]].

== Generalization ==

A stratification of the complement of an infinite co-dimension subspace of the space of smooth maps &lt;math&gt;\{ f \colon M \to \mathbb R \}&lt;/math&gt; was eventually developed by Sergeraert.&lt;ref&gt;F. Sergeraert "Un theoreme de fonctions implicites sur certains espaces de Fréchet et quelques applications," Ann. Sci. Ecole Norm. Sup. (4) 5 (1972), 599–660.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''classification theorem''' answers the classification problem "What are the objects of a given type, up to some equivalence?". It gives a non-redundant enumeration: each object is equivalent to exactly one class.

A few related issues to classification are the following.

*The equivalence problem is "given two objects, determine if they are equivalent".
*A [[complete set of invariants]], together with which invariants are realizable, solves the classification problem, and is often a step in solving it.
*A computable [[complete set of invariants]] (together with which invariants are realizable) solves both the classification problem and the equivalence problem.
* A [[canonical form]] solves the classification problem, and is more data: it not only classifies every class, but provides a distinguished (canonical) element of each class.

In [[computing]], '''decimal32''' is a [[decimal floating-point]] [[computer numbering format]] that occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) in computer memory.
It is intended for applications where it is necessary to emulate decimal rounding exactly, such as financial and tax computations. Like the [[Half-precision floating-point format|binary16]] format, it is intended for memory saving storage.

Decimal32 supports 7 [[decimal digit]]s of [[significand]] and  an [[exponent]] range of −95 to +96, i.e. {{gaps|±0.000|000|e=-95}} to ±{{gaps|9.999|999|e=96}}.  (Equivalently, {{gaps|±0|000|000|e=-101}} to {{gaps|±9|999|999|e=90}}.)  Because the significand is not normalized (there is no implicit leading "1"), most values with less than 7 [[significant digits]] have multiple possible representations; {{gaps|1×10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|&amp;#61;|0.1×10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;|&amp;#61;|0.01×10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, etc.  Zero has 192 possible representations (384 when both [[signed zero]]s are included).

Decimal32 floating point is a relatively new decimal floating-point format, formally introduced in the [[IEEE 754-2008|2008 version]]&lt;ref name="IEEE-754_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic |author=IEEE Computer Society |date=2008-08-29 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |id=IEEE Std 754-2008 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935 |ref=CITEREFIEEE_7542008 |isbn=978-0-7381-5753-5 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=4610933 |access-date=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[IEEE 754]] as well as with [[ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011]].&lt;ref name="ISO-60559_2011"&gt;{{cite journal |title=ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57469 |date=2011 |access-date=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of decimal32 values ==

|-
! Sign !! Combination !! Exponent continuation !! Coefficient continuation
|-
! 1 bit !! 5 bits !! 6 bits !! 20 bits

|}

IEEE 754 allows two alternative representation methods for decimal32 values.
The standard does not specify how to signify which representation is used,
for instance in a situation where decimal32 values are communicated between systems.

In one representation method, based on [[binary integer decimal]] (BID),
the significand is represented as binary coded positive integer.

The other, alternative, representation method is based on
[[densely packed decimal]] (DPD) for most of the
significand (except the most significant digit).

Both alternatives provide exactly the same range of representable numbers: 7 digits of significand and {{gaps|3×2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;|&amp;#61;|192}} possible exponent values.

In both cases, the most significant 4 bits of the significand (which actually only have 10 possible values) are combined with the most significant 2 bits of the exponent (3 possible values) to use 30 of the 32 possible values of a 5-bit field called the combination field.  The remaining combinations encode [[infinity|infinities]] and [[NaN]]s.

'''Note:''' The sign bit of NaNs is ignored. The first bit of the remaining exponent determines whether the NaN is quiet or signaling.

=== Binary integer significand field ===
This format uses a binary significand from 0 to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;−1 = {{gaps|9|999|999}} = 98967F&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = {{gaps|1001|1000100101|1001111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  The encoding can represent binary significands up to 10×2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;−1 = {{gaps|10|485|759}} = 9FFFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; = {{gaps|1001|1111111111|1111111111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, but values larger than 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;−1 are illegal (and the standard requires implementations to treat them as 0, if encountered on input).

As described above, the encoding varies depending on whether the most significant 4 bits of the significand are in the range 0 to 7 (0000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 0111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), or higher (1000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 1001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then the 
exponent field consists of the 8 bits following the sign bit, and the
significand is the remaining 23 bits, with an implicit leading 0 bit:

 s 00eeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 01eeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 10eeeeee   (0)ttt tttttttttt tttttttttt

This includes [[subnormal numbers]] where the leading significand digit is 0.

If the 2 bits after the sign bit are "11", then the 8-bit exponent field is shifted 2 bits to the right (after both the sign bit and the "11" bits thereafter), and the represented significand is in the remaining 21 bits. In this case there is an implicit (that is, not stored) leading 3-bit sequence "100" in the true significand.

 s 1100eeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1101eeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt
 s 1110eeeeee (100)t tttttttttt tttttttttt

The "11" 2-bit sequence after the sign bit indicates that there is an ''implicit'' "100" 3-bit
prefix to the significand. Compare having an implicit 1 in the significand of normal
values for the binary formats. Note also that the "00", "01", or "10" bits are part of the exponent field.

Note that the leading bits of the significand field do ''not'' encode the most significant decimal digit; they are simply part of a larger pure-binary number.  For example, a significand of {{gaps|8|000|000}} is encoded as binary {{gaps|0111|1010000100|1000000000}}, with the leading 4 bits encoding 7; the first significand which requires a 24th bit is 2&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; = {{gaps|8|388|608}}

In the above cases, the value represented is

: (−1)&lt;sup&gt;sign&lt;/sup&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;exponent−101&lt;/sup&gt; × significand &lt;!-- Remember, significand is defined as an integer: 0 &lt;= significand &lt; 10^8 --&gt;

If the four bits after the sign bit are "1111" then the value is an infinity or a NaN, as described above:

 s 11110 xx...x    ±infinity
 s 11111 0x...x    a quiet NaN
 s 11111 1x...x    a signalling NaN

=== Densely packed decimal significand field ===
In this version, the significand is stored as a series of decimal digits.  The leading digit is between 0 and 9 (3 or 4 binary bits), and the rest of the significand uses the [[densely packed decimal]] (DPD) encoding.

Unlike the binary integer significand version, where the exponent changed position and came before the significand, this encoding combines the leading 2 bits of the exponent and the leading digit (3 or 4 bits) of the significand into the five bits that follow the sign bit.

These six bits after that are the exponent continuation field, providing the less-significant bits of the exponent.

The last 20 bits are the significand continuation field, consisting of two 10-bit ''[[declet (computing)|declet]]s''.&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"&gt;{{cite book |author-last1=Muller |author-first1=Jean-Michel |author-last2=Brisebarre |author-first2=Nicolas |author-last3=de Dinechin |author-first3=Florent |author-last4=Jeannerod |author-first4=Claude-Pierre |author-last5=Lefèvre |author-first5=Vincent |author-last6=Melquiond |author-first6=Guillaume |author-last7=Revol |author-first7=Nathalie |author-last8=Stehlé |author-first8=Damien |author-last9=Torres |author-first9=Serge |title=Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetic |year=2010 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |edition=1 |isbn=978-0-8176-4704-9&lt;!-- print --&gt; |doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4705-6 |lccn=2009939668&lt;!-- |isbn=978-0-8176-4705-6 (online), ISBN 0-8176-4704-X (print) --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each declet encodes three decimal digits&lt;ref name="Muller_2010"/&gt; using the DPD encoding.

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "00", "01", or "10", then those are
the leading bits of the exponent, and the three bits after that are interpreted as
the leading decimal digit (0 to 7):

 s 00 TTT (00)eeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 01 TTT (01)eeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 10 TTT (10)eeeeee (0TTT)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]

If the first two bits after the sign bit are "11", then the 
second two bits are the leading bits of the exponent, and the last bit is
prefixed with "100" to form the leading decimal digit (8 or 9):

 s 1100 T (00)eeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 1101 T (01)eeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]
 s 1110 T (10)eeeeee (100T)[tttttttttt][tttttttttt]

The remaining two combinations (11110 and 11111) of the 5-bit field
are used to represent ±infinity and NaNs, respectively.

The DPD/3BCD transcoding for the declets is given by the following table.
b9...b0 are the bits of the DPD, and d2...d0 are the three BCD digits.

{{error-small|This table is only for Densely Packed Decimal and lacks clarity}}

{{Densely packed decimal}}

The 8 decimal values whose digits are all 8s or 9s have four codings each.
The bits marked x in the table above are ignored on input, but will always be 0 in computed results.
(The 8×3 = 24 non-standard encodings fill in the gap between 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=1000 and 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;=1024.)

In the above cases, with the ''true significand'' as the sequence of decimal digits decoded, the value represented is

:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^\text{signbit}\times 10^{\text{exponentbits}_2-101_{10}}\times \text{truesignificand}_{10}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6725">[[File:UndirectedDegrees (Loop).svg|thumb|A graph with vertices labeled by degree]]

In [[graph theory]], the '''degree''' (or '''valency''') of a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the number of [[edge (graph theory)|edges]] [[incidence (graph theory)|incident]] to the vertex, with [[loop (graph theory)|loop]]s counted twice.&lt;ref&gt;Diestel p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of a vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\deg(v)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\deg v&lt;/math&gt;. The '''maximum degree''' of a graph ''G'', denoted by Δ(''G''), and the '''minimum degree''' of a graph, denoted by δ(''G''), are the maximum and minimum degree of its vertices. In the graph on the right, the maximum degree is 5 and the minimum degree is 0.  In a [[regular graph]], all degrees are the same, and so we can speak of ''the'' degree of the graph.

==Handshaking lemma==
{{main|handshaking lemma}}
The '''degree sum formula''' states that, given a graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V, E)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|\, .&lt;/math&gt;

The formula implies that in any undirected graph, the number of vertices with odd degree is even. This statement (as well as the degree  sum formula) is known as the [[handshaking lemma]]. The latter name comes from a popular mathematical problem, to prove that in any group of people the number of people who have shaken hands with an odd number of other people from the group is even.

==Degree sequence==
[[File:Conjugate-dessins.svg|thumb|200px|Two non-isomorphic graphs with the same degree sequence (3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1).]]
The '''degree sequence''' of an undirected graph is the non-increasing sequence of its vertex degrees;&lt;ref&gt;Diestel p.278&lt;/ref&gt; for the above graph it is (5, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0). The degree sequence is a [[graph invariant]] so [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic graphs]] have the same degree sequence. However, the degree sequence does not, in general, uniquely identify a graph; in some cases, non-isomorphic graphs have the same degree sequence.

The '''degree sequence problem'''  is the problem of finding some or all graphs with the degree sequence being a given non-increasing sequence of positive integers. (Trailing zeroes may be ignored since they are trivially realized by adding an appropriate number of isolated vertices to the graph.) A sequence which is the degree sequence of some graph, i.e. for which the degree sequence problem has a solution, is called a '''graphic''' or '''graphical sequence'''. As a consequence of the degree sum formula, any sequence with an odd sum, such as (3,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;1), cannot be realized as the degree sequence of a graph. The converse is also true: if a sequence has an even sum, it is the degree sequence of a multigraph. The construction of such a graph is straightforward: connect vertices with odd degrees in pairs by a [[matching (graph theory)|matching]], and fill out the remaining even degree counts by self-loops.
The question of whether a given degree sequence can be realized by a [[simple graph]] is more challenging. This problem is also called [[graph realization problem]] and can either be solved by the [[Erdős–Gallai theorem]] or the [[Havel–Hakimi algorithm]]. 
The problem of finding or estimating the  number of graphs with a given degree sequence is a problem from the field of [[graph enumeration]].

==Special values==
[[File:Depth-first-tree.png|thumb|An undirected graph with leaf nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12]]
*A vertex with degree 0 is called an [[isolated vertex]].
*A vertex with degree 1 is called a leaf vertex or end vertex, and the edge incident with that vertex is called a pendant edge. In the graph on the right, {3,5} is a pendant edge. This terminology is common in the study of [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]s in graph theory and especially [[tree (data structure)|tree]]s as [[data structure]]s.
* A vertex with degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1  in a graph on ''n'' vertices is called a [[dominating vertex]].

==Global properties==
*If each vertex of the graph has the same degree&amp;nbsp;''k'' the graph is called a [[regular graph|''k''-regular graph]] and the graph itself is said to have degree&amp;nbsp;''k''. Similarly, a [[bipartite graph]] in which every two vertices on the same side of the bipartition as each other have the same degree is called a [[biregular graph]].
*An undirected, connected graph has an [[Eulerian path]] if and only if it has either 0 or 2 vertices of odd degree. If it has 0 vertices of odd degree, the Eulerian path is an Eulerian circuit.
*A directed graph is a [[pseudoforest]] if and only if every vertex has outdegree at most&amp;nbsp;1. A functional graph is a special case of a pseudoforest in which every vertex has outdegree exactly&amp;nbsp;1.
*By [[Brooks' theorem]], any graph other than a clique or an odd cycle has [[chromatic number]] at most&amp;nbsp;Δ, and by [[Vizing's theorem]] any graph has [[chromatic index]] at most Δ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.
*A [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|''k''-degenerate graph]] is a graph in which each subgraph has a vertex of degree at most ''k''.

The '''Delsarte–Goethals code''' is a type of [[error-correcting code]].

== History ==

The concept was introduced by mathematicians Ph. Delsarte and J.-M. Goethals in their published paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Delsarte-Goethals_code|title=Delsarte-Goethals code - Encyclopedia of Mathematics|website=www.encyclopediaofmath.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ujnhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=delsarte+goethals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OO2UgUoL3h&amp;sig=NQGFf3kLTOWEURsddtlrFBYHZ5E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjywOW8jv_TAhXEpY8KHeNQBc4Q6AEIRjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=delsarte%20goethals&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|last=Hazewinkel|first=Michiel|date=2007-11-23|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780306483738|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new proof of the properties of the Delsarte–Goethals code was published in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071579711001067|title=A new proof of Delsarte, Goethals and Mac Williams theorem on minimal weight codewords of generalized Reed–Muller codes - ScienceDirect|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22|doi=10.1016/j.ffa.2011.12.003|volume=18|journal=Finite Fields and Their Applications|pages=581–586 | last1 = Leducq | first1 = Elodie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==

The Delsarte–Goethals code DG(''m'',''r'') for even ''m'' ≥ 4 and 0 ≤ ''r'' ≤ ''m''/2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is a binary, [[non-linear code]] of length &lt;math&gt;2^{m}&lt;/math&gt;, size &lt;math&gt;2^{r(m-1)+2m}&lt;/math&gt; and [[Block code#The distance d|minimum distance]] &lt;math&gt;2^{m-1} - 2^{m/2-1+r}&lt;/math&gt;

The code sits between the [[Kerdock code]] and the second-order [[Reed–Muller code]]s. More precisely, we have

: &lt;math&gt;K(m) \subseteq DG(m,r) \subseteq RM(2,m)&lt;/math&gt;

When ''r'' = 0, we have DG(''m'',''r'') = ''K''(''m'') and when ''r'' = ''m''/2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 we have DG(''m'',''r'') = RM(2,''m'').

For ''r'' = ''m''/2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 the Delsarte–Goethals code has strength 7 and is therefore an [[orthogonal array]] OA(&lt;math&gt;2^{3m-1}, 2^m, \mathbb{Z}_2, 7)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mint.sbg.ac.at/desc_CDelsarteGoethals.html|title=MinT - Delsarte–Goethals Codes|last=Schürer|first=Rudolf|website=mint.sbg.ac.at|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ujnhBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=delsarte+goethals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OO2UgUoL3h&amp;sig=NQGFf3kLTOWEURsddtlrFBYHZ5E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjywOW8jv_TAhXEpY8KHeNQBc4Q6AEIRjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=delsarte%20goethals&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopaedia of Mathematics, Supplement III|last=Hazewinkel|first=Michiel|date=2007-11-23|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780306483738|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D. |last2=Pischke |first2=J. S. |year=2008 |title=Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-691-12034-8 |pages=227–243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztXL21Xd8v8C&amp;pg=PA227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It calculates the effect of a treatment (i.e., an explanatory variable or an [[independent variable]]) on an outcome (i.e., a response variable or [[dependent variable]]) by comparing the average change over time in the outcome variable for the treatment group, compared to the average change over time for the control group. Although it is intended to mitigate the effects of extraneous factors and [[selection bias]], depending on how the treatment group is chosen, this method may still be subject to certain biases (e.g., [[regression to the mean|mean regression]], [[Reverse causality bias|reverse causality]] and [[omitted variable bias]]).

In contrast to a [[time series|time-series estimate]] of the treatment effect on subjects (which analyzes differences over time) or a cross-section estimate of the treatment effect (which measures the difference between treatment and control groups), difference in differences uses [[panel data]] to measure the differences, between the treatment and control group, of the changes in the outcome variable that occur over time.

==General definition==
[[File:Illustration of Difference in Differences.png|thumb|upright=1.3]]
Difference in differences requires data measured from a treatment group and a control group at two or more different time periods, specifically at least one time period before "treatment" and at least one time period after "treatment." In the example pictured, the outcome in the treatment group is represented by the line P and the outcome in the control group is represented by the line S. The outcome (dependent) variable in both groups is measured at time 1, before either group has received the treatment (i.e., the independent or explanatory variable), represented by the points ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The treatment group then receives or experiences the treatment and both groups are again measured at time 2. Not all of the difference between the treatment and control groups at time 2 (that is, the difference between ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be explained as being an effect of the treatment, because the treatment group and control group did not start out at the same point at time 1. DID therefore calculates the "normal" difference in the outcome variable between the two groups (the difference that would still exist if neither group experienced the treatment), represented by the dotted line ''Q''. (Notice that the slope from ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''Q'' is the same as the slope from ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) The treatment effect is the difference between the observed outcome and the "normal" outcome (the difference between P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Q).

==Formal definition==

Consider the model

: &lt;math&gt;y_{it} ~=~ \gamma_{s(i)} + \lambda_t + \delta I(s(i) \text{ is the treatment group, } t \text{ is in the after period}) + \varepsilon_{it}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_{it}&lt;/math&gt; is the dependent variable for [[Sampling (statistics)|individual]] &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the group to which &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; belongs, and &lt;math&gt; I(\dots) &lt;/math&gt; is short-hand for the [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variable]] equal to 1 when the event described in &lt;math&gt; (\dots) &lt;/math&gt; is true, and 0 otherwise. In the plot of time versus &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; by group, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_s&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical intercept for the graph for &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_t&lt;/math&gt; is the time trend shared by both groups according to the parallel trend assumption (see [[Difference in differences#Assumptions|Assumptions]] below). &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the treatment effect, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{it}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Errors and residuals in statistics|residual term]].

Let's consider the average of the dependent variable and dummy indicators by group and time:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
n_s &amp; = \text{ number of individuals in group } s \\
\overline{y}_{st} &amp; = \frac{1}{n_s} \sum_{i=1}^n y_{it} \ I(s(i) ~=~ s), \\
\overline{\gamma}_s &amp; = \frac{1}{n_s} \sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_s(i) \ I(s(i) ~=~ s) ~=~ \gamma_s, \\
\overline{\lambda}_{st} &amp; = \frac{1}{n_s} \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_t \ I(s(i) ~=~ s) ~=~ \lambda_t, \\
D_{st} &amp; = \frac{1}{n_s} \sum_{i=1}^n I(s(i) ~=~\text{ treatment, } t \text{ in after period}) \ I(s(i) ~=~ s) ~=~ I(s ~=~\text{ treatment, } t \text{ in after period}) , \\
\overline{\varepsilon}_{st} &amp; = \frac{1}{n_s} \sum_{i=1}^n \varepsilon_{it} \ I(s(i) ~=~ s),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and suppose for simplicity that &lt;math&gt;s=1,2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t=1,2&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;D_{st}&lt;/math&gt; is not random; it just encodes how the groups and the periods are labeled. Then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (\overline{y}_{11} - \overline{y}_{12}) - (\overline{y}_{21} - \overline{y}_{22}) \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \big[ (\gamma_1 + \lambda_1 + \delta D_{11} + \overline{\varepsilon}_{11}) - (\gamma_1 + \lambda_2 + \delta D_{12} + \overline{\varepsilon}_{12}) \big] \\
&amp; \qquad {} - \big[ (\gamma_2 + \lambda_1 + \delta D_{21} + \overline{\varepsilon}_{21}) - (\gamma_2 + \lambda_2 + \delta D_{22} + \overline{\varepsilon}_{22}) \big] \\[6pt]
= {} &amp; \delta (D_{11} - D_{12}) + \delta(D_{22} - D_{21}) + \overline{\varepsilon}_{11} - \overline{\varepsilon}_{12} + \overline{\varepsilon}_{22} - \overline{\varepsilon}_{21}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Ordinary least squares#Assumptions|strict exogeneity assumption]] then implies that

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \left [ (\overline{y}_{11} - \overline{y}_{12}) - (\overline{y}_{21} - \overline{y}_{22}) \right ] ~=~ \delta (D_{11} - D_{12}) + \delta(D_{22} - D_{21}).&lt;/math&gt;

[[Without loss of generality]], assume that &lt;math&gt;s = 2&lt;/math&gt; is the treatment group, and &lt;math&gt;t = 2&lt;/math&gt; is the after period, then &lt;math&gt;D_{22}=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_{11}=D_{12}=D_{21}=0&lt;/math&gt;, giving the DID estimator

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\delta} ~=~ (\overline{y}_{11} - \overline{y}_{12}) - (\overline{y}_{21} - \overline{y}_{22}),&lt;/math&gt;

which can be interpreted as the treatment effect of the treatment indicated by &lt;math&gt;D_{st}&lt;/math&gt;. Below it is shown how this estimator can be read as a coefficient in an ordinary least squares regression. The model described in this section is over-parametrized; to remedy that, one of the coefficients for the dummy variables can be set to 0, for example, we may set &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Assumptions==

[[File:Parallel Trend Assumption.png|right|thumb|320px| Illustration of the parallel trend assumption]]

All the assumptions of the [[Ordinary least squares#Assumptions|OLS model]] apply equally to DID. In addition, DID requires a '''parallel trend assumption'''. The parallel trend assumption says that &lt;math&gt;\lambda_2 - \lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; are the same in both &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=2&lt;/math&gt;. Given that the [[Difference in differences#Formal Definition|formal definition]] above accurately represents reality, this assumption automatically holds. However, a model with &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{st} ~:~ \lambda_{22} - \lambda_{21} \neq \lambda_{12} - \lambda_{11}&lt;/math&gt; may well be more realistic.

As illustrated to the right, the treatment effect is the difference between the observed value of ''y'' and what the value of ''y'' would have been with parallel trends, had there been no treatment. The Achilles' heel of DID is when something other than the treatment changes in one group but not the other at the same time as the treatment, implying a violation of the parallel trend assumption.

To guarantee the accuracy of the DID estimate, the composition of individuals of the two groups is assumed to remain unchanged over time. When using a DID model, various issues that may compromise the results, such as [[autocorrelation]] and [[Ashenfelter dip]]s, must be considered and dealt with.

==Implementation==

The DID method can be implemented according to the table below, where the lower right cell is the DID estimator.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;y_{st}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;s=2&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;s=1&lt;/math&gt; !! Difference
|-
| &lt;math&gt;t=2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y_{22}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y_{12}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y_{12}-y_{22}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y_{21}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y_{11}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y_{11}-y_{21}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| '''Change''' || &lt;math&gt;y_{21}-y_{22}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;y_{11}-y_{12}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;(y_{11}-y_{21})-(y_{12}-y_{22})&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Running a regression analysis gives the same result. Consider the OLS model

: &lt;math&gt;y ~=~ \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 S + \beta_3 (T \cdot S) + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a dummy variable for the period, equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;t=2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a dummy variable for group membership, equal to &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;s=2&lt;/math&gt;. The composite variable &lt;math&gt;(T \cdot S)&lt;/math&gt; is a dummy variable indicating when &lt;math&gt;S=T=1&lt;/math&gt;. Although it is not shown rigorously here, this is a proper parametrization of the model [[Difference in differences#Formal Definition|formal definition]], furthermore, it turns out that the group and period averages in that section relate to the model parameter estimates as follows

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\hat{\beta}_0 &amp; = \widehat{E}(y \mid T=0,~ S=0) \\[8pt]
\hat{\beta}_1 &amp; = \widehat{E}(y \mid T=1,~ S=0) - \widehat{E}(y \mid T=0,~ S=0) \\[8pt]
\hat{\beta}_2 &amp; = \widehat{E}(y \mid T=0,~ S=1) - \widehat{E}(y \mid T=0,~ S=0) \\[8pt]
\hat{\beta}_3 &amp; = \big[\widehat{E}(y \mid T=1,~ S=1) - \widehat{E}(y \mid T=0,~ S=1)\big] \\
&amp; \qquad {} - \big[\widehat{E}(y \mid T=1,~ S=0) - \widehat{E}(y \mid T=0,~ S=0)\big],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{E}(\dots \mid \dots )&lt;/math&gt; stands for conditional averages computed on the sample, for example, &lt;math&gt;T=1&lt;/math&gt; is the indicator for the after period, &lt;math&gt;S=0&lt;/math&gt; is an indicator for the control group. To see the relation between this notation and the previous section, consider as above only one observation per time period for each group, then

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \widehat{E}(y \mid T=1,~ S=0) &amp; = \widehat{E}(y \mid \text{ after period, control}) \\
[3pt] \\
&amp; = \frac{  \widehat{E}(y \ I(\text{ after period, control}) )}{ \widehat{P}(\text{ after period, control})} \\                 
[3pt] \\
&amp; = \frac{  \sum_{i=1}^n    y_{i,\text{after}} I(i \text{ in control}) }   {  n_{\text{control}} } = \overline{y}_{\text{control, after}} \\
[3pt] \\
&amp; = \overline{y}_{\text{12}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and so on for other values of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta}_3 ~=~ (y_{11} - y_{21}) - (y_{12} - y_{22}).&lt;/math&gt;

But this is the expression for the treatment effect that was given in the [[Difference in differences#Formal Definition|formal definition]] and in the above table.

Consider one of the most famous DID studies, the [[David Card|Card]] and [[Alan Krueger|Krueger]] article on [[minimum wage]] in [[New Jersey]], published in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Card |first2=Alan B. |last2=Krueger |year=1994 |title=Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=772–793 |doi= |jstor=2118030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Card and Krueger compared [[Unemployment|employment]] in the [[fast food]] sector in New Jersey and in [[Pennsylvania]], in February 1992 and in November 1992, after New Jersey's minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05 in April 1992. Observing a change in employment in New Jersey only, before and after the treatment, would fail to control for [[Omitted-variable bias|omitted variables]] such as weather and macroeconomic conditions of the region. By including Pennsylvania as a control in a difference-in-differences model, any bias caused by variables common to New Jersey and Pennsylvania is implicitly controlled for, even when these variables are unobserved. Assuming that New Jersey and Pennsylvania have parallel trends over time, Pennsylvania's change in employment can be interpreted as the change New Jersey would have experienced, had they not increased the minimum wage, and vice versa. The evidence suggested that the increased minimum wage did not induce an increase in unemployment in New Jersey, as standard economic theory would suggest. The table below shows Card &amp; Krueger's estimates of the treatment effect on employment, measured as [[Full-time equivalent|FTEs (or full-time equivalents)]]. Keeping in mind that the finding is [[Minimum wage#Card and Krueger|controversial]], Card and Krueger estimate that the $0.80 minimum wage increase in New Jersey led to a 2.75 FTE increase in employment.

In [[mathematics]] and specifically in [[algebraic geometry]], the '''dimension''' of an [[algebraic variety]] may be defined in various equivalent ways.

Some of these definitions are of geometric nature, while some other are purely algebraic and rely on [[commutative algebra]]. Some are restricted to algebraic varieties while others apply also to any [[algebraic set]]. Some are intrinsic, as independent of any embedding of the variety into an [[affine space|affine]] or [[projective space]], while other are related to such an embedding.

== Dimension of an affine algebraic set ==

Let {{math|''K''}} be a [[field (mathematics)|field]], and {{math|''L'' ⊇ ''K''}} be an  algebraically closed extension. An [[affine algebraic set]] {{math|''V''}} is the set of the common [[zero of a function|zeros]] in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} of the elements of an ideal {{math|''I''}} in a polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;R=K[x_1, \ldots, x_n].&lt;/math&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;A=R/I&lt;/math&gt; be the algebra of the polynomial functions over {{math|''V''}}. The dimension of {{math|''V''}} is any of the following integers. It does not change if {{math|''K''}} is enlarged, if {{math|''L''}} is replaced by another algebraically closed extension of {{math|''K''}} and if {{math|''I''}} is replaced by another ideal having the same zeros (that is having the same [[radical of an ideal|radical]]). The dimension is also independent of the choice of coordinates; in other words it does not change if the {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are replaced by linearly independent linear combinations of them. The dimension of {{math|''V''}} is
* ''The maximal length'' &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of the chains &lt;math&gt;V_0\subset V_1\subset \ldots \subset V_d&lt;/math&gt; ''of distinct nonempty (irreducible) subvarieties of {{math|V}}.''
This definition generalizes a property of the dimension of a [[Euclidean space]] or a [[vector space]]. It is  thus probably the definition that gives the easiest intuitive description of the notion. 
* ''The [[Krull dimension]] of the coordinate ring {{mvar|A}}.''
This is the transcription of the preceding definition in the language of [[commutative algebra]], the Krull dimension being the maximal length of the chains &lt;math&gt;p_0\subset p_1\subset \ldots \subset p_d&lt;/math&gt; of [[prime ideal]]s of {{math|''A''}}.
* ''The maximal Krull dimension of the [[local ring]]s at the points of {{mvar|V}}'', if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;is irreducible.

This definition shows that the dimension is a ''local property if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;is irreducible.''

* ''If {{mvar|V}} is a variety, the Krull dimension of the local ring at any [[Singular point of an algebraic variety|regular point]] of {{mvar|V}}''

This rephrases the previous definition into a more geometric language.
* ''The maximal dimension of the [[tangent space|tangent vector space]]s at the non [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singular point]]s of {{mvar|V}}''.
This relates the dimension of a variety to that of a [[differentiable manifold]]. More precisely, if {{math|''V''}} if defined over the reals, then the set of its real regular points, if it is not empty, is a differentiable manifold that has the same dimension as a variety and as a manifold.
* ''If {{mvar|V}} is a variety, the dimension of the [[tangent space|tangent vector space]] at any non [[singular point of an algebraic variety|singular point]] of {{mvar|V}}''.
This is the algebraic analogue to the fact that a connected [[manifold]] has a constant dimension.
* ''The number of [[hyperplane]]s or [[hypersurface]]s in [[general position]] which are needed to have an intersection with {{mvar|V}} which is reduced to a nonzero finite number of points.''
This definition is not intrinsic as it apply only to algebraic sets that are explicitly embedded in an affine or projective space.
* ''The maximal length of a [[regular sequence]] in the coordinate ring {{mvar|A}}''.
This the algebraic translation of the preceding definition.
* ''The difference between {{mvar|n}} and the maximal length of the regular sequences contained in {{mvar|I}}''.
This is the algebraic translation of the fact that the intersection of {{math|''n'' – ''d''}} general hypersurfaces is an algebraic set of dimension {{math|''d''}}. 
* ''The degree of the [[Hilbert polynomial]] of {{mvar|A}}''.
* ''The degree of the denominator of the [[Hilbert series]] of {{mvar|A}}''.
This allows, through a [[Gröbner basis]] computation to compute the dimension of the algebraic set defined by a given [[system of polynomial equations]].
* ''The dimension of the simplicial complex whose [[Stanley–Reisner_ring|Stanley-Reisner ring]] is &lt;math&gt;R/J&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Radical_of_an_ideal|radical]] of any initial ideal of I.''
Taking initial ideals preserves Hilbert polynomial/series, and taking radicals preserves the dimension.&lt;ref&gt; Cox, David A.; Little, John; O'Shea, Donal Ideals, varieties, and algorithms. An introduction to computational algebraic geometry and commutative algebra. Fourth edition. Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics. Springer, Cham, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''If {{mvar|I}} is a prime ideal (i.e. {{mvar|V}} is an algebraic variety), the [[transcendence degree]] over {{mvar|K}} of the [[field of fractions]] of {{mvar|A}}''.
This allows to prove easily that the dimension is invariant under [[birational equivalence]].

== Dimension of a projective algebraic set ==

Let ''V'' be a [[projective algebraic set]] defined as the set of the common zeros of a homogeneous ideal ''I'' in a polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;R=K[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n]&lt;/math&gt; over a field ''K'', and let ''A''=''R''/''I'' be the [[graded algebra]] of the polynomials over ''V''.

All the definitions of the previous section apply, with the change that, when ''A'' or ''I'' appear explicitly in the definition, the value of the dimension must be reduced by one. For example, the dimension of ''V'' is one less than the Krull dimension of ''A''.

== Computation of the dimension ==

Given a [[system of polynomial equations]] over an algebraically closed field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, it may be difficult to compute the dimension of the algebraic set that it defines.

Without further information on the system, there is only one practical method, which consists of computing a Gröbner basis and deducing the degree of the denominator of the [[Hilbert series]] of the ideal generated by the equations.

The second step, which is usually the fastest, may be accelerated in the following way: Firstly, the Gröbner basis is replaced by the list of its leading monomials (this is already done for the computation of the Hilbert series). Then each monomial like &lt;math&gt;{x_1}^{e_1}\cdots {x_n}^{e_n}&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the product of the variables in it: &lt;math&gt;x_1^{\min (e_1,1)}\cdots x_n^{\min(e_n,1)}.&lt;/math&gt; Then the dimension is the maximal size of a subset ''S'' of the variables, such that none of these products of variables depends only on the variables in ''S''.

This algorithm is implemented in several [[computer algebra system]]s. For example in [[Maple (software)|Maple]], this is the function ''Groebner[HilbertDimension],'' and in [[Macaulay2]], this is the function ''dim''.

== Real dimension ==
{{see also|Complex dimension}}
The ''real dimension'' of a set of real points, typically a [[semialgebraic set]], is the dimension of its [[Zariski closure]]. For a semialgebraic set {{mvar|S}}, the real dimension is one of the following equal integers:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* The real dimension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the dimension of its Zariski closure.
* The real dimension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the maximal integer &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that there is a [[homeomorphism]] of &lt;math&gt;[0,1]^d&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
* The real dimension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the maximal integer &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that there is a [[Affine space#Projection|projection]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; over a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional subspace with a non-empty [[interior (topology)|interior]].

For an algebraic set defined over the [[real number|reals]] (that is defined by polynomials with real coefficients), it may occur that the real dimension of the set of its real points is smaller than its dimension as a semi algebraic set. For example, the [[algebraic surface]] of equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2=0&lt;/math&gt; is an algebraic variety of dimension two, which has only one real point (0, 0, 0), and thus has the real dimension zero.

The real dimension is more difficult to compute than the algebraic dimension.
For the case of a real [[hypersurface]] (that is the set of real solutions of a single polynomial equation), there exists a probabilistic algorithm to compute its real dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">In the [[geometry of numbers]], '''Ehrhart's volume conjecture''' gives an upper bound on the volume of a [[convex body]] containing only one lattice point in its interior.  It is a kind of converse to [[Minkowski's theorem]], which guarantees that a centrally symmetric convex body ''K'' must contain a lattice point as soon as its volume exceeds &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt;.  The conjecture states that a convex body ''K'' containing only one lattice point in its interior as it's barycenter cannot have volume greater than &lt;math&gt;(n+1)^n/n!&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Vol}(K) \le \frac{(n+1)^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;
Equality is achieved in this inequality when &lt;math&gt;K=(n+1)\Delta_n&lt;/math&gt; is a copy of the [[standard simplex]] in Euclidean ''n''-dimensional space, whose sides are scaled up by a factor of &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt;.  Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;K=(n+1)\Delta_n&lt;/math&gt; is congruent to the convex hull of the vectors &lt;math&gt;-\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n\mathbf{e}_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Presented in this manner, the origin is the only lattice point interior to the convex body ''K''.

The conjecture, furthermore, asserts that equality is achieved in the above inequality if and only if ''K'' is unimodularly equivalent to &lt;math&gt;(n+1)\Delta_n&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14813">In [[mathematics]], an [[integral polytope]] has an associated '''Ehrhart polynomial''' that encodes the relationship between the volume of a [[polytope]] and the number of [[integer point]]s the polytope contains. The theory of Ehrhart polynomials can be seen as a higher-dimensional generalization of [[Pick's theorem]] in the [[Euclidean plane]].

These polynomials are named after [[Eugène Ehrhart]] who studied them in the 1960s.

==Definition==
Informally, if {{math|''P''}} is a [[polytope]], and {{math|''tP''}} is the polytope formed by expanding {{math|''P''}} by a factor of {{math|''t''}} in each dimension, then {{math|''L''(''P'', ''t'')}} is the number of [[integer lattice]] points in {{math|''tP''}}.

More formally, consider a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; in [[Euclidean space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and a {{math|''d''}}-[[dimension]]al polytope {{math|''P''}} in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the property that all vertices of the polytope are points of the lattice. (A common example is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{Z}^n&lt;/math&gt; and a polytope for which all vertices have [[integer]] coordinates.) For any positive integer {{math|''t''}}, let {{math|''tP''}} be the {{math|''t''}}-fold dilation of {{math|''P''}} (the polytope formed by multiplying each vertex coordinate, in a basis for the lattice, by a factor of {{math|''t''}}), and let

:&lt;math&gt;L(P,t) = \#\left(tP \cap \mathcal{L}\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

be the number of lattice points contained in the polytope {{math|''tP''}}. Ehrhart showed in 1962 that {{math|''L''}} is a rational [[polynomial]] of degree {{math|''d''}} in {{math|''t''}}, i.e. there exist [[rational number]]s &lt;math&gt;L_0(P),\dots,L_d(P)&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;L(P, t) = L_d(P) t^d + L_{d-1}(P) t^{d-1} + \cdots + L_0(P)&lt;/math&gt;

for all positive integers {{math|''t''}}.

The Ehrhart polynomial of the [[interior (topology)|interior]] of a closed convex polytope {{math|''P''}} can be computed as:
:&lt;math&gt; L(\operatorname{int}(P), t) = (-1)^d L(P, -t),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''d''}} is the dimension of {{math|''P''}}. This result is known as Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=Ian G.|title=Polynomials Associated with Finite Cell-Complexes|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society|year=1971|volume=2|issue=1|pages=181–192|doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-4.1.181 |url=http://jlms.oxfordjournals.org/content/s2-4/1/181.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of Ehrhart polynomials==
[[File:Second dilate of a unit square.png|thumbnail|This is the second dilate, {{math|''t'' {{=}} 2}}, of a unit square. It has nine integer points.]]


Let {{math|''P''}} be a {{math|''d''}}-dimensional [[unit cube|unit]] [[hypercube]] whose vertices are the integer lattice points all of whose coordinates are 0 or 1. In terms of inequalities,

:&lt;math&gt; P = \left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^d : 0 \le x_i \le 1; 1 \le i \le d\right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then the {{math|''t''}}-fold dilation of {{math|''P''}} is a cube with side length {{math|''t''}}, containing {{math|(''t'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}} integer points. That is, the Ehrhart polynomial of the hypercube is {{math|''L''(''P'',''t'') {{=}} (''t'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|De Loera|Rambau|Santos|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mathar|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if we evaluate {{math|''L''(''P'', ''t'')}} at negative integers, then

: &lt;math&gt;L(P, -t) = (-1)^d (t - 1)^d = (-1)^d L(\operatorname{int}(P), t), &lt;/math&gt;

as we would expect from Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity.

Many other [[figurate number]]s can be expressed as Ehrhart polynomials. For instance, the [[square pyramidal number]]s are given by the Ehrhart polynomials of a [[square pyramid]] with an integer unit square as its base and with height one; the Ehrhart polynomial in this case is {{math|{{sfrac|1|6}}(''t'' + 1)(''t'' + 2)(2''t'' + 3)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beck|De Loera|Develin|Pfeifle|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ehrhart quasi-polynomials==

Let {{math|''P''}} be a rational polytope. In other words, suppose

:&lt;math&gt;P = \left\{ x\in\mathbb{R}^d : Ax \le b\right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathbb{Q}^{k \times d} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; b \in \mathbb{Q}^k &lt;/math&gt;. (Equivalently, {{math|''P''}} is the [[convex hull]] of finitely many points in {{math|ℚ&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.) Then define

: &lt;math&gt; L(P, t) = \#\left(\left\{x\in\mathbb{Z}^n : Ax \le tb\right\}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

In this case, {{math|''L''(''P'', ''t'')}} is a [[quasi-polynomial]] in {{math|''t''}}. Just as with integral polytopes, Ehrhart–Macdonald reciprocity holds, that is,

: &lt;math&gt; L(\operatorname{int}(P), t) = (-1)^n L(P, -t). &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples of Ehrhart quasi-polynomials==

Let {{math|''P''}} be a polygon with vertices (0,0), (0,2), (1,1) and ({{sfrac|3|2}}, 0). The number of integer points in {{math|''tP''}} will be counted by the quasi-polynomial &lt;ref name=MR2271992&gt;{{cite book|title=Computing the Continuous Discretely|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=46–47|last=Beck|first=Matthias|last2=Robins|first2=Sinai|MR=2271992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; L(P, t) = \frac{7t^2}{4} + \frac{5t}{2} + \frac{7 + (-1)^t}{8}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretation of coefficients==
If {{math|''P''}} is [[closed set|closed]] (i.e. the boundary faces belong to {{math|''P''}}), some of the coefficients of {{math|''L''(''P'', ''t'')}} have an easy interpretation:
* the leading coefficient, &lt;math&gt;L_d(P)&lt;/math&gt;, is equal to the {{math|''d''}}-dimensional [[volume]] of {{math|''P''}}, divided by {{math|''d''(''L'')}} (see [[lattice (group)|lattice]] for an explanation of the content or covolume {{math|''d''(''L'')}} of a lattice);
* the second coefficient, &lt;math&gt;L_{d-1}(P)&lt;/math&gt;, can be computed as follows: the lattice {{math|''L''}} induces a lattice {{math|''L&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;''}} on any face {{math|''F''}} of {{math|''P''}}; take the {{math|(''d'' − 1)}}-dimensional volume of {{math|''F''}}, divide by {{math|2''d''(''L&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, and add those numbers for all faces of {{math|''P''}};
* the constant coefficient {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Euler characteristic]] of {{math|''P''}}. When {{math|''P''}} is a closed convex polytope, &lt;math&gt;L_0(P)=1&lt;/math&gt;}.

  Gitterpolytopen}, J. Reine Angew. Math. 358, 202-208.&lt;/ref&gt; established the following characterization of the Ehrhart coefficients. A functional &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; defined on integral polytopes is an SL&lt;math&gt;(n,\mathbb Z)&lt;/math&gt; and translation invariant [[Valuation (measure theory)|valuation]] if and only if there are &lt;math&gt;c_0,\dots, c_n\in\mathbb \R&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt; Z= c_0 L_0+\dots +c_n L_n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Ehrhart series==

We can define a [[generating function]] for the Ehrhart polynomial of an integral {{math|''d''}}-dimensional polytope {{math|''P''}} as

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Ehr}_P(z) = \sum_{t\ge 0} L(P, t)z^t. &lt;/math&gt;

This series can be expressed as a [[rational function]]. Specifically, Ehrhart proved (1962){{cn|date=February 2017}} that there exist complex numbers {{math|''h''{{su|b=''i''|p=*}}}}, {{math|0 ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''d''}}, such that the Ehrhart series of {{math|''P''}} is

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Ehr}_P(z) = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^d h_j^\ast(P) z^j}{(1 - z)^{d + 1}}, \qquad \sum_{j=0}^d h_j^\ast(P) \neq 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, Stanley's non-negativity theorem states that under the given hypotheses, {{math|''h''{{su|b=''i''|p=*}}}} will be non-negative integers, for {{math|0 ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''d''}}.

Another result by Stanley{{cn|date=February 2017}} shows that if {{math|''P''}} is a lattice polytope contained in {{math|''Q''}}, then {{math|''h''{{su|b=''i''|p=*}}(''P'') ≤ ''h''{{su|b=''i''|p=*}}(''Q'')}} for all {{math|''i''}}.

The {{math|''h''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}-vector is in general not unimodal, but it is whenever it is symmetric, and the polytope has a
regular unimodal triangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Athanasiadis|first1=Christos A.|title=''h''*-Vectors, Eulerian Polynomials and Stable Polytopes of Graphs|journal=Electronic Journal of Combinatorics|year=2004|volume=11|issue=2|url=http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v11i2r6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ehrhart series for rational polytopes===

Similar to the case of polytopes with integer vertices, one defines the Ehrhart series for a rational polytope. For a rational polytope {{math|''P''}}, where {{math|''d''}} is the smallest integer such that {{math|''dP''}} is an integer polytope ({{math|''d''}} is called the denominator of {{math|''P''}}), then one has

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ehr}_P(z) = \sum_{t\ge 0} L(P, t)z^t = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{j=0}^{d(n+1)} h_j^\ast(P) z^j}{\left(1 - z^d\right)^{n + 1}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''h''{{su|b=''i''|p=*}}}} are still non-negative integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=Richard P.|title=Decompositions of rational convex polytopes|journal=Ann. Discrete Math.|date=1980|volume=6|pages=333–342|doi=10.1016/s0167-5060(08)70717-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Matthias|last2=Sottile|first2=Frank|title=Irrational proofs for three theorems of Stanley|journal=European Journal of Combinatorics|date=January 2007|volume=28|issue=1|pages=403–409|doi=10.1016/j.ejc.2005.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toric variety==
The case {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''d'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''t'' {{=}} 1}} of these statements yields [[Pick's theorem]]. Formulas for the other coefficients are much harder to get; [[Todd class]]es of [[toric variety|toric varieties]], the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] as well as [[Fourier analysis]] have been used for this purpose.

If {{math|''X''}} is the [[toric variety]] corresponding to the normal fan of {{math|''P''}}, then {{math|''P''}} defines an [[ample line bundle]] on {{math|''X''}}, and the Ehrhart polynomial of {{math|''P''}} coincides with the [[Hilbert polynomial]] of this line bundle.

Ehrhart polynomials can be studied for their own sake. For instance, one could ask questions related to the roots of an Ehrhart polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Braun|first=Benjamin|last2=Develin|first2=Mike|title=Ehrhart Polynomial Roots and Stanley's Non-Negativity Theorem|journal=American Mathematical Society|year=2008|volume=452|series=Contemporary Mathematics|pages=67–78|doi=10.1090/conm/452/08773|arxiv=math/0610399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some authors have pursued the question of how these polynomials could be classified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higashitani|first=Akihiro|title=Classification of Ehrhart Polynomials of Integral Simplices|journal=DMTCS Proceedings|year=2012|pages=587–594|url=http://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/fpsac12/download/contributed/dmAR0152.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

It is possible to study the number of integer points in a polytope {{math|''P''}} if we dilate some facets of {{math|''P''}} but not others. In other words, one would like to know the number of integer points in semi-dilated polytopes. It turns out that such a counting function will be what is called a multivariate quasi-polynomial. An Ehrhart-type reciprocity theorem will also hold for such a counting function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Matthias|title=Multidimensional Ehrhart reciprocity|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory|date=January 2002|volume=97|series=Series A|issue=1|pages=187–194|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097316501932200|doi=10.1006/jcta.2001.3220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counting the number of integer points in semi-dilations of polytopes has applications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lisonek|first=Petr|title=Combinatorial Families Enumerated by Quasi-polynomials|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory|year=2007|volume=114|series=Series A|issue=4|pages=619–630|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097316506001427|doi=10.1016/j.jcta.2006.06.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in enumerating the number of different dissections of regular polygons and the number of non-isomorphic unrestricted codes, a particular kind of code in the field of [[coding theory]].

|The only symmetrical solution to the eight queens puzzle (except for rotations and reflections of itself).
}}
The '''eight queens puzzle''' is the problem of placing eight [[chess]] [[Queen (chess)|queen]]s on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general '''''n'' queens problem''' of placing ''n'' non-attacking queens on an ''n''×''n'' chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers ''n'' with the exception of ''n''=2 and ''n''=3.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Hoffman et al., "Construction for the Solutions of the m Queens Problem". ''Mathematics Magazine'', Vol. XX (1969), pp.&amp;nbsp;66–72. [http://penguin.ewu.edu/~trolfe/QueenLasVegas/Hoffman.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Chess composer]] [[Max Bezzel]] published the eight queens puzzle in 1848. [[Franz Nauck]] published the first solutions in 1850.&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) "The Eight Queens Problem", in ''Mathematical Recreations and Essays'', Macmillan, New York, pp. 165–171.&lt;/ref&gt; Nauck also extended the puzzle to the ''n'' queens problem, with ''n'' queens on a [[chessboard]] of ''n'' × ''n'' squares.

Since then, many [[mathematician]]s, including [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], have worked on both the eight queens puzzle and its generalized ''n''-queens version. In 1874, [[S. Gunther]] proposed a method using [[determinant]]s to find solutions.&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"/&gt; [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|J.W.L. Glaisher]] refined Gunther's approach.

In 1972, [[Edsger Dijkstra]] used this problem to illustrate the power of what he called [[structured programming]]. He published a highly detailed description of a [[Depth-first search|depth-first]] [[Backtracking|backtracking algorithm]].&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;

== Constructing and counting solutions ==
The problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 (''i.e.'', [[Combination|&lt;sub&gt;64&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]]) possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8×8 board, but only 92 solutions. It is possible to use shortcuts that reduce computational requirements or rules of thumb that avoids [[Brute-force search|brute-force computational techniques]]. For example, by applying a simple rule that constrains each queen to a single column (or row), though still considered brute force, it is possible to reduce the number of possibilities to 16,777,216 (that is, 8&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) possible combinations. Generating [[permutation]]s further reduces the possibilities to just 40,320 (that is, [[factorial|8!]]), which are then checked for diagonal attacks.

[[Martin Richards (computer scientist)|Martin Richards]] published a program to count solutions to the n-queens problem using [[bitwise operation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Richards. Backtracking Algorithms in MCPL using Bit Patterns and Recursion. University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr10/backtrk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this solution has already been published by Zongyan Qiu&lt;ref name="Qiu paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qiu|first1=Zongyan|title=Bit-vector encoding of n-queen problem|journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices|date=February 2002|volume=37|issue=2|page=68-70|doi=10.1145/568600.568613}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Solutions ===
The eight queens puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. If solutions that differ only by the [[symmetry]] operations of rotation and reflection of the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 solutions.  These are called ''fundamental'' solutions; representatives of each are shown below.

A fundamental solution usually has eight variants (including its original form) obtained by rotating 90, 180, or 270° and then reflecting each of the four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed position. However, should a solution be equivalent to its own 90° rotation (as happens to one solution with five queens on a 5×5 board), that fundamental solution will have only two variants (itself and its reflection). Should a solution be equivalent to its own 180° rotation (but not to its 90° rotation), it will have four variants (itself and its reflection, its 90° rotation and the reflection of that). If ''n'' &gt; 1, it is not possible for a solution to be equivalent to its own reflection because that would require two queens to be facing each other.  Of the 12 fundamental solutions to the problem with eight queens on an 8×8 board, exactly one (solution 12 below) is equal to its own 180° rotation, and none is equal to its 90° rotation; thus, the number of distinct solutions is 11×8 + 1×4 = 92 (where the 8 is derived from four 90° rotational positions and their reflections, and the 4 is derived from two 180° rotational positions and their reflections).

All fundamental solutions are presented below:

==Existence of solutions==

These brute-force algorithms to count the number of solutions are computationally manageable for {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8}}, but would be intractable for problems of {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;20}}, as 20! = 2.433 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;.  If the goal is to find a single solution, one can show solutions exist for all ''n'' ≥ 4 with no search whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/130000/122322/p7-bernhardsson.pdf?ip=128.125.133.201&amp;CFID=44352328&amp;CFTOKEN=62267842&amp;__acm__=1316815405_9a82b00e821cdd41080729f6f3f40975 ''Explicit Solutions to the N-Queens Problem for all N''], Bo Bernhardsson (1991), Department of Automatic Control, Lund Institute of Technology, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt;

| Staircase solution for 10 queens
}}
{{col-end}}

The examples above can be obtained with the following formulas.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Let (''i'', ''j'') be the square in column ''i'' and row ''j'' on the ''n'' × ''n'' chessboard, ''k'' an integer.

# If ''n'' is even and ''n'' ≠ 6''k'' + 2, then place queens at (''i'', 2''i'') and ({{sfrac|''n''|2}} + ''i'', 2''i'' − 1) for ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., {{sfrac|''n''|2}}.
# If ''n'' is even and ''n'' ≠ 6''k'', then place queens at (''i'', 1 + ((2''i'' + {{sfrac|''n''|2}} − 3 ) mod ''n'')) and (''n'' + 1 − ''i'', ''n'' − ((2''i'' + {{sfrac|''n''|2}} − 3 ) mod ''n'')) for ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., {{sfrac|''n''|2}}.
# If ''n'' is odd, then use one of the patterns above for ''n'' − 1 and add a queen at (''n'', ''n'').

Another approach{{cn|date=November 2018}} is

# If the remainder from dividing ''n'' by 6 is not 2 or 3 then the list is simply all even numbers followed by all odd numbers not greater than ''N''.
# Otherwise, write separate lists of even and odd numbers (2, 4, 6, 8 — 1, 3, 5, 7).
# If the remainder is 2, swap 1 and 3 in odd list and move 5 to the end ('''3, 1''', 7, '''5''').
# If the remainder is 3, move 2 to the end of even list and 1,3 to the end of odd list (4, 6, 8, '''2''' — 5, 7, '''1, 3''').
# Append odd list to the even list and place queens in the rows given by these numbers, from left to right (a2, b4, c6, d8, e3, f1, g7, h5).

For {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8}} this results in fundamental solution 1 above. A few more examples follow.

* 14 queens (remainder 2): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 3, 1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 5.
* 15 queens (remainder 3): 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 1, 3.
* 20 queens (remainder 2): 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 3, 1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 5.

The six queens puzzle has fewer solutions than the five queens puzzle.

There is currently no known formula for the exact number of solutions, or even for its asymptotic behaviour. As of now, the 27x27 board is the highest-order board that has been completely enumerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://github.com/preusser/q27 The Q27 Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a single solution for a bigger board is not difficult.

==Related problems==
*Higher dimensions
:Find the number of non-attacking queens that can be placed in a ''d''-dimensional chess space of size ''n''.  More than ''n'' queens can be placed in some higher dimensions (the smallest example is four non-attacking queens in a 3 × 3 × 3 chess space), and it is in fact known that for any ''k'', there are higher dimensions where ''n''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; queens do not suffice to attack all spaces.&lt;ref&gt;J. Barr and S. Rao (2006), The n-Queens Problem in Higher Dimensions, Elemente der Mathematik, vol 61 (4), pp. 133–137.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using pieces other than queens
:On an 8×8 board one can place 32 [[knight (chess)|knight]]s, or 14 [[bishop (chess)|bishop]]s, 16 [[king (chess)|king]]s or eight [[rook (chess)|rook]]s, so that no two pieces attack each other. [[Fairy chess piece]]s have also been substituted for queens.  In the case of knights, an easy solution is to place one on each square of a given color, since they move only to the opposite color. The solution is also easy for rooks and kings. Eight rooks can be placed along a long diagonal (amongst thousands of other solutions), and 16 kings are placed on the board by dividing it into 2 by 2 squares and placing the kings at equivalent points on each square.
*[[Permutation matrix]]
:In mathematics, a permutation matrix can be regarded geometrically as a set of ''n'' points lying on the squares of a ''n''x''n'' chessboard, such that each row or column contains only one point. Thus, an order-''n'' permutation matrix is a solution to an ''n''-rooks puzzle.
*Nonstandard boards
:[[George Pólya|Pólya]] studied the ''n'' queens problem on a [[torus|toroidal]] ("donut-shaped") board and showed that there is a solution on an n×n board if and only if n is not divisible by 2 or 3.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pólya, Uber die "doppelt-periodischen" Losungen des n-Damen-Problems, George Pólya:
   Collected papers Vol. IV, G-C. Rota, ed., MIT Press, Cambridge, London, 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–247
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Pearson and Pearson algorithmically populated [http://queens.lyndenlea.info/beyond2d.php three-dimensional boards] ''(n×n×n)'' with ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; queens, and proposed that multiples of these can yield solutions for a four-dimensional version of the puzzle.
*Domination
:Given an ''n''×''n'' board, the '''domination number''' is the minimum number of queens (or other pieces) needed to attack or occupy every square. For n=8 the queen's domination number is 5.
*[http://www.chessvariants.org/problems.dir/9queens.html Nine queens problem]
:Place nine queens and one pawn on an 8×8 board in such a way that queens don't attack each other. Further generalization of the problem (complete solution is currently unknown): given an ''n''×''n'' chess board and ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' queens, find the minimum number of pawns, so that the ''m'' queens and the pawns can be set up on the board in such a way that no two queens attack each other.
*[http://www.vector.org.uk/archive/v213/hui213.htm Queens and knights problem]

*[[Magic square]]s
: In 1992, Demirörs, Rafraf, and Tanik published a method for converting some magic squares into ''n''-queens solutions, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;O. Demirörs, N. Rafraf, and M.M. Tanik. Obtaining n-queens solutions from magic squares and constructing magic squares from n-queens solutions. Journal of Recreational Mathematics, 24:272–280, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Latin square]]s
: In an ''n''×''n'' matrix, place each digit 1 through ''n'' in ''n'' locations in the matrix so that no two instances of the same digit are in the same row or column.
*[[Exact cover]]
: Consider a matrix with one primary column for each of the ''n'' ranks of the board, one primary column for each of the ''n'' files, and one secondary column for each of the 4''n'' − 6 nontrivial diagonals of the board.  The matrix has ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; rows: one for each possible queen placement, and each row has a 1 in the columns corresponding to that square's rank, file, and diagonals and a 0 in all the other columns.  Then the ''n'' queens problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of the rows of this matrix such that every primary column has a 1 in precisely one of the chosen rows and every secondary column has a 1 in at most one of the chosen rows; this is an example of a generalized [[exact cover]] problem, of which [[sudoku]] is another example.

==Exercise in algorithm design==
Finding all solutions to the eight queens puzzle is a good example of a simple but nontrivial problem. For this reason, it is often used as an example problem for various programming techniques, including nontraditional approaches such as [[constraint programming]], [[logic programming]] or [[genetic algorithm]]s. Most often, it is used as an example of a problem that can be solved with a [[recursion|recursive]] [[algorithm]], by phrasing the ''n'' queens problem inductively in terms of adding a single queen to any solution to the problem of placing ''n''&amp;minus;1 queens on an n-by-n chessboard. The [[mathematical induction|induction]] bottoms out with the solution to the 'problem' of placing 0 queens on the chessboard, which is the empty chessboard.

This technique is much more efficient than the naïve [[brute-force search]] algorithm, which considers all 64&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 281,474,976,710,656 possible blind placements of eight queens, and then filters these to remove all placements that place two queens either on the same square (leaving only 64!/56!&amp;nbsp;= 178,462,987,637,760 possible placements) or in mutually attacking positions. This very poor algorithm will, among other things, produce the same results over and over again in all the different [[permutation]]s of the assignments of the eight queens, as well as repeating the same computations over and over again for the different sub-sets of each solution. A better brute-force algorithm places a single queen on each row, leading to only 8&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 16,777,216 blind placements.

It is possible to do much better than this.
One algorithm solves the eight [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] puzzle by generating the permutations of the numbers 1 through 8 (of which there are 8! = 40,320), and uses the elements of each permutation as indices to place a queen on each row.
Then it rejects those boards with diagonal attacking positions.
The [[backtracking]] [[depth-first search]] program, a slight improvement on the permutation method, constructs the [[search tree]] by considering one row of the board at a time, eliminating most nonsolution board positions at a very early stage in their construction.
Because it rejects rook and diagonal attacks even on incomplete boards, it examines only 15,720 possible queen placements.
A further improvement, which examines only 5,508 possible queen
placements, is to combine the permutation based method with the early
pruning method: the permutations are generated depth-first, and
the search space is pruned if the [[partial permutation]] produces a
diagonal attack.
[[Constraint programming]] can also be very effective on this problem.

[[File:8queensminconflict.gif|thumbnail|right|[[Min-conflicts algorithm|min-conflicts]] solution to 8 queens]]
An alternative to exhaustive search is an 'iterative repair' algorithm, which typically starts with all queens on the board, for example with one queen per column.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=4DC9292839FE7B1AFABA1EDB8183242C?doi=10.1.1.57.4685&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf A Polynomial Time Algorithm for the N-Queen Problem] by Rok Sosic and Jun Gu, 1990.  Describes run time for up to 500,000 Queens which was the max they could run due to memory constraints.&lt;/ref&gt; It then counts the number of conflicts (attacks), and uses a heuristic to determine how to improve the placement of the queens. The '[[Min-conflicts algorithm|minimum-conflicts]]' [[heuristic]] &amp;mdash; moving the piece with the largest number of conflicts to the square in the same column where the number of conflicts is smallest &amp;mdash; is particularly effective: it finds a solution to the 1,000,000 queen problem in less than 50 steps on average. This assumes that the initial configuration is 'reasonably good' &amp;mdash; if a million queens all start in the same row, it will take at least 999,999 steps to fix it. A 'reasonably good' starting point can for instance be found by putting each queen in its own row and column so that it conflicts with the smallest number of queens already on the board.

Unlike the backtracking search outlined above, iterative repair does not guarantee a solution: like all [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] procedures, it may get stuck on a local optimum.  (In such a case, the algorithm may be restarted with a different initial configuration.) On the other hand, it can solve problem sizes that are several orders of magnitude beyond the scope of a depth-first search.

[[Image:Eight-queens-animation.gif]]

This animation illustrates [[backtracking]] to solve the problem. A queen is placed in a column that is known not to cause conflict. If a column is not found the program returns to the last good state and then tries a different column.

==Sample program==
The following is a [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]  program by [[Niklaus Wirth]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Wirth, 1976, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; It finds one solution to the eight queens problem.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;program eightqueen1(output);
 
var i : integer; q : boolean;
    a : array[ 1 .. 8] of boolean;
    b : array[ 2 .. 16] of boolean;
    c : array[ -7 .. 7] of boolean;
    x : array[ 1 .. 8] of integer;
 
procedure try( i : integer; var q : boolean);
    var j : integer;
    begin 
    j := 0;
    repeat 
        j := j + 1; 
        q := false;
        if a[ j] and b[ i + j] and c[ i - j] then
            begin 
            x[ i    ] := j;
            a[ j    ] := false; 
            b[ i + j] := false; 
            c[ i - j] := false;
            if i &lt; 8 then
                begin
                try( i + 1, q);
                if not q then
                    begin 
                    a[ j] := true; 
                    b[ i + j] := true; 
                    c[ i - j] := true;
                    end
                end 
            else 
                q := true
            end
    until q or (j = 8);
    end;
 
begin
for i :=  1 to  8 do a[ i] := true;
for i :=  2 to 16 do b[ i] := true;
for i := -7 to  7 do c[ i] := true;
try( 1, q);
if q then
    for i := 1 to 8 do write( x[ i]:4);
writeln
end.&lt;/source&gt;

==Biography==
Grinbergs was born on January 25, 1911 in [[St. Petersburg]], the son of a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] bishop from Latvia. Latvia became independent from Russia in 1917, and on the death of his father in 1923, Grinbergs' family returned to [[Riga]], taking Grinbergs with them.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taimina"/&gt;

In 1927, he won a high school mathematics competition, the prize for which was to study in [[Lille]], [[France]]. He then studied mathematics at the [[University of Latvia]] beginning in 1930. On graduating in 1934, he won a prize that again funded study in France; he did graduate studies in 1935 and 1936 at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in [[Paris]], during which he published his first paper, in geometry. He returned to the University of Latvia as a ''[[privatdozent]]'' in 1937, and joined the faculty as a [[dozent]] in 1940. His lectures at that time covered subjects including [[geometry]], [[probability theory]], and [[group theory]]. While there, he defended a thesis in geometry at the University of Latvia in 1943, entitled ''On Oscillations, Superoscillations and Characteristic Points''.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taimina"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Emanuels Jan Grinbergs|id=108735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the [[Soviet Union]] had annexed Latvia in 1940, and the army of [[Nazi Germany]] had occupied it and incorporated it into the [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]. Grinbergs was drafted into the [[Latvian Legion]], part of the German military, in 1944. After the war, because of his service as a German soldier, he was held prisoner in a camp in [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], until 1946; he lost his university position, and his doctorate (awarded during the German occupation) was annulled.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taimina"/&gt;

Grinbergs returned to Latvia, where he became a factory worker in the Radiotehnika radio factory, while continuing to be interrogated regularly by the KGB. He developed mathematical models of electrical circuits, which he wrote up as a second thesis, ''Problems of analysis and synthesis of simple linear circuits'', his defense of which earned him a [[Candidate of Sciences|candidate]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;Dambitis and Taimina write that he defended this thesis in 1960, but the date given by Šostak and MacTutor is 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Grinbergs was allowed to return to the University of Latvia faculty. In 1956, he joined the Institute of Physics of the [[Latvian Academy of Sciences]], and in 1960, he began working at the Computer Center of the University of Latvia, where he remained for the rest of his career, eventually becoming Chief Scientist there.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taimina"/&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Grinberg 5CEC Nonhamiltonian graph.svg|thumb|A non-Hamiltonian planar graph found by Grinbergs]]
Grinbergs' initial research interests were in geometry, and later shifted to graph theory. With professors Arins and Daube at the University of Latvia, Grinbergs was one of the first to work in applied mathematics and computer science in Latvia.&lt;ref name="taimina"/&gt;

Grinbergs and his collaborators wrote many papers on the design of electrical circuits and [[electronic filter]]s, stemming from his radio work. He earned the State Prize of the Latvian SSR in 1980 for his research on nonlinear electronic circuit theory.&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;

Another early line of research by Grinbergs at the Computer Center concerned the automated design of ship hulls, and the computations with [[spline curve]]s and surfaces needed in this design. The goal of this research was to calculate patterns for cutting and then bending flat steel plates so that they could be welded together to form ship hulls without the need for additional machining after the bending step; the methods developed by Grinbergs were later used throughout the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="mactutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taimina"/&gt;

In graph theory, Grinbergs is best known for [[Grinberg's theorem]], a necessary condition for a [[planar graph]] to have a [[Hamiltonian cycle]] that has been frequently used to find non-Hamiltonian planar graphs with other special properties.&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Other topics in Grinbergs' research include [[Steiner triple system]]s, [[magnetohydrodynamics]], [[operations research]], and the mathematical modeling of [[hydrocarbon exploration]].&lt;ref name="d91"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1850">The '''extension''' of a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]{{spaced ndash}}a [[truth-value]]d [[function (mathematics)|function]]{{spaced ndash}}is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[tuple]]s of values that, used as arguments, satisfy the predicate. Such a set of tuples is a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]].

==Examples==
For example, the statement "''d2'' is the weekday following ''d1''" can be seen as a truth function associating to each tuple (''d2'', ''d1'') the value ''true'' or ''false''. The extension of this truth function is, by convention, the set of all such tuples associated with the value ''true'', i.e.

 {(Monday, Sunday),
  (Tuesday, Monday),
  (Wednesday, Tuesday),
  (Thursday, Wednesday),
  (Friday, Thursday),
  (Saturday, Friday),
  (Sunday, Saturday)}

By examining this extension we can conclude that "Tuesday is the weekday following Saturday" (for example) is false.

Using [[set-builder notation]], the extension of the [[arity|''n''-ary]] predicate &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\{ (x_1,...,x_n) \mid \Phi(x_1,...,x_n) \}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship with characteristic function==
If the values 0 and 1 in the range of a [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] are identified with the values false and true, respectively{{spaced ndash}}making the characteristic function a predicate{{spaced ndash}}, then for all relations ''R'' and predicates &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; the following two statements are equivalent:
*&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic function of ''R''
*''R'' is the extension of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7901">The '''Gale–Ryser theorem''' is a result in [[graph theory]] and [[combinatorial matrix theory]], two branches of [[combinatorics]]. It provides one of two known approaches to solving the [[bipartite realization problem]], i.e. it gives a necessary and sufficient condition for two [[finite sequence]]s of [[natural number]]s to be the [[Degree (graph theory)#Degree sequence|degree sequence]] of a labeled [[simple graph|simple]] [[bipartite graph]]; a sequence obeying these conditions is called "bigraphic". It is an analog of the [[Erdős–Gallai theorem]] for simple graphs. The theorem was published in 1957 by [[H. J. Ryser]] and also by [[David Gale]].

==Theorem statement==
A pair of sequences of nonnegative [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_1\geq\cdots\geq a_n&lt;/math&gt; is bigraphic if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i&lt;/math&gt; and the following inequality holds for k such that &lt;math&gt;1 \leq  k \leq n&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sum^k_{i=1} a_i\leq \sum^n_{i=1} \min(b_i,k).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Remark==
Sometimes this theorem is stated with the additional constraint &lt;math&gt;b_1\geq\cdots\geq b_n&lt;/math&gt;. This condition is not necessary, because the labels of vertices of one [[bipartite graph|partite set]] in a [[bipartite graph]] can be switched arbitrarily.
In 1962 Ford and Fulkerson &lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ford (Jr.)|Fulkerson|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a different but equivalent formulation for the theorem.

==Other notations==
The theorem can also be stated in terms of zero-one [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The connection can be seen if one realizes that each [[bipartite graph]] has a [[adjacency matrix|biadjacency matrix]] where the column sums and row sums correspond to &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Each sequence can also be considered as a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of the same number &lt;math&gt;m=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i&lt;/math&gt;. It turns out that partition &lt;math&gt;(a^*_1,\ldots,a^*_n)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a^*_k:=|\{b_i|b_i \geq k\}|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partition (number theory)|conjugate partition]] of &lt;math&gt;(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;. The conjugate partition can be determined by a [[partition (number theory)|Ferrers diagram]]. Moreover, there is a connection to the relation [[majorization]]. Consider sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(a^*_1,\ldots,a^*_n)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vectors &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^*&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^k a^*_i =\sum^n_{i=1} \min(b_i,k) &lt;/math&gt;, the theorem above states that a pair of nonnegative integer sequences a and b with nonincreasing a is bigraphic if and only if the conjugate partition &lt;math&gt;a^*&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; majorizes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. 
A third formulation is in terms of degree sequences of simple [[directed graph]]s with at most one [[loop (graph theory)|loop]] per [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]]. In this case the matrix is interpreted as the [[directed graph|adjacency matrix]] of such a directed graph. When are pairs of nonnegative [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;((a_1,b_1),...,(a_n,b_n))&lt;/math&gt; the [[directed graph|indegree]]-[[directed graph|outdegree]] pairs of a labeled [[directed graph]] with at most one loop per vertex? The theorem can easily be adapted to this formulation, because there does not exist a special order of b.

==Proofs==
The proof is composed of two parts: the necessity of the condition and its sufficiency. We outline the proof of both parts in the language of matrices. To see that the condition in the theorem is necessary, consider the adjacency matrix of a bigraphic realization with row sums &lt;math&gt;(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt; and column sums &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and shift all ones in the matrix to the left. The row sums remain, while the column sums are now &lt;math&gt;a^*&lt;/math&gt;. The operation of shifting all ones to the left increases a partition in majorization order, and so &lt;math&gt;a^*&lt;/math&gt; majorizes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

The original proof of sufficiency of the condition was rather complicated. {{harvtxt|Krause|1996}} gave a simple algorithmic proof. The idea is to start with the [[Ferrers diagram#Ferrers diagram|Ferrers diagram]] of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and shift ones to the right until the column sums are &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm runs in at most &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; steps, in each of which a single one entry is moved to the right.

==Stronger version==
Berger&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Berger|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that it suffices to consider those &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th inequalities such that &lt;math&gt;1 \leq k &lt; n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_k &gt; a_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; and the equality for &lt;math&gt;k = n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Generalization==
A pair of finite sequences of nonnegative [[integer]]s &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with nonincreasing &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is bigraphic if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_i&lt;/math&gt; and there exists a sequence &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that the pair &lt;math&gt;c,b&lt;/math&gt; is bigraphic and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; majorizes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Berger|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, in &lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Berger|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also proved that pair &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; has more bigraphic realizations than pair  &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. This yields to the result that [[regular sequence]]s have for fixed numbers of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] the largest number of bigraphic realizations, if n divides m. They are the `contrary sequences' of [[threshold sequences]] with only one unique bigraphic realization, which is known as [[threshold graph]]. [[Minconvex sequence]]s generalize this concept if n does not divide m. 

==Characterizations for similar problems==
Similar theorems describe the degree sequences of simple graphs and simple directed graphs. The first problem is characterized by the [[Erdős–Gallai theorem]]. The latter case is characterized by the [[Fulkerson–Chen–Anstee theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4380">'''Hilbert's fifteenth problem''' is one of the 23 [[Hilbert problems]] set out in a celebrated list compiled in 1900 by [[David Hilbert]].  The problem is to put [[Schubert's enumerative calculus]] on a rigorous foundation.

==Introduction==
Splitting the question, as now it would be understood, into [[Schubert calculus]] and [[enumerative geometry]], the former is well-founded on the basis of the topology of [[Grassmannian]]s, and [[intersection theory]]. The latter has status that is less clear, if clarified with respect to the position in 1900.{{vague|date=August 2017}}

While enumerative geometry made no connection with physics during the first century of its development, it has since emerged as a central element of [[string theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Problem statement==

The entirety of the original problem statement is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The problem consists in this: To establish rigorously and with an exact determination of the limits of their validity those geometrical numbers which Schubert especially has determined on the basis of the so-called principle of special position, or conservation of number, by means of the enumerative calculus developed by him.

Although the algebra of today guarantees, in principle, the possibility of carrying out the processes of elimination, yet for the proof of the theorems of enumerative geometry decidedly more is requisite, namely, the actual carrying out of the process of elimination in the case of equations of special form in such a way that the degree of the final equations and the multiplicity of their solutions may be foreseen.&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, David, "Mathematische Probleme" [[Göttinger Nachrichten]], (1900), pp. 253-297, and in [[Archiv der Mathematik und Physik]], (3) '''1''' (1901), 44-63 and 213-237.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Schubert calculus==
{{main|Schubert calculus}}
[[Schubert calculus]] is a branch of [[algebraic geometry]] introduced in the nineteenth century by [[Hermann Schubert]], in order to solve various counting problems of [[projective geometry]] (part of [[enumerative geometry]]). It was a precursor of several more modern theories, for example [[characteristic class]]es, and in particular its algorithmic aspects are still of current interest.

The objects introduced by Schubert are the '''Schubert cells''', which are [[locally closed]] sets in a [[Grassmannian]] defined by conditions of [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of a linear subspace in projective space with a given [[Flag (linear algebra)|flag]]. For details see [[Schubert variety]].

[[File:Trig functions on unit circle.PNG|thumb|Visual proof of the [[Pythagorean identity]]. For any angle θ, The point (cos(θ),sin(θ)) lies on the [[unit circle]], which satisfies the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1. Thus, cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(θ)+sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(θ)=1.]]

In [[mathematics]] an '''identity''' is an [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] relation ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B'', such that ''A'' and ''B'' contain some [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] and ''A'' and ''B'' produce the same value as each other regardless of what values (usually numbers) are substituted for the variables. In other words, ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B'' is an identity if ''A'' and ''B'' define the same [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. This means that an ''identity'' is an ''equality'' between functions that are differently defined. For example, (''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''ab''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and {{nowrap|1=cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1}} are identities. Identities are sometimes indicated by the [[triple bar]] symbol {{math|≡}} instead of {{math|1==}}, the [[equals sign]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Joan (2004).''Frege Explained''. Open Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common identities ==

=== Trigonometric identities ===
{{Main|List of trigonometric identities}}

Geometrically, these are identities involving certain functions of one or more [[angle]]s.  They are distinct from [[Trigonometry#Triangle identities|triangle identities]], which are identities involving both angles and side lengths of a [[triangle]]. Only the former are covered in this article.

These identities are useful whenever expressions involving trigonometric functions need to be simplified. An important application is the [[integral|integration]] of non-trigonometric functions: a common technique involves first using the [[Trigonometric substitution|substitution rule with a trigonometric function]], and then simplifying the resulting integral with a trigonometric identity.

One example is &lt;math&gt; \sin ^2 \theta +  \cos ^2 \theta = 1, &lt;/math&gt;
which is true for all [[Complex number|complex]] values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (since the complex numbers &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; are the domain of sin and cos), as opposed to
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
which is true only for some values of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, not all.  For example, the latter equation is true when &lt;math&gt; \theta = 0,&lt;/math&gt; false when &lt;math&gt;\theta = 2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Exponential identities ===
{{Main|Exponentiation}}

The following identities hold for all integer exponents, provided that the base is non-zero:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      b^{m + n} &amp;= b^m \cdot b^n \\
        (b^m)^n &amp;= b^{m\cdot n} \\
  (b \cdot c)^n &amp;= b^n \cdot c^n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Exponentiation is not [[commutative]]. This contrasts with addition and multiplication, which are. For example, {{nowrap|1=2 + 3 = 3 + 2 = 5}} and {{nowrap|1=2 · 3 = 3 · 2 = 6}}, but {{nowrap|1=2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8}}, whereas {{nowrap|1=3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9}}.

Exponentiation is not [[associative]] either. Addition and multiplication are. For example,
{{nowrap|1=(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) = 9}} and {{nowrap|1=(2 · 3) · 4 = 2 · (3 · 4) = 24}}, but 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to the 4 is 8&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; or 4,096, whereas 2 to the 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is 2&lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt; or 2,417,851,639,229,258,349,412,352. Without parentheses to modify the order of calculation, by convention the order is top-down, not bottom-up:
:&lt;math&gt;b^{p^q} = b^{(p^q)} \ne (b^p)^q = b^{(p \cdot q)} = b^{p \cdot q} .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Logarithmic identities ===
{{Main|Logarithmic identities}}
Several important formulas, sometimes called ''logarithmic identities'' or ''log laws'', relate logarithms to one another.&lt;ref&gt;All statements in this section can be found in {{Harvard citations|last1=Shirali|first1=Shailesh|year=2002|loc=section 4|nb=yes}}, {{Harvard citations|last1=Downing| first1=Douglas |year=2003|loc=p. 275}}, or {{Harvard citations|last1=Kate|last2=Bhapkar|year=2009|loc=p. 1-1|nb=yes}}, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Product, quotient, power and root ====
The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers being multiplied; the logarithm of the ratio of two numbers is the difference of the logarithms. The logarithm of the {{nowrap|''p''-th}} power of a number is ''p'' times the logarithm of the number itself; the logarithm of a {{nowrap|''p''-th}} root is the logarithm of the number divided by ''p''. The following table lists these identities with examples. Each of the identities can be derived after substitution of the logarithm definitions {{nowrap begin}}x = b&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(x)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{nowrap end}}, and/or {{nowrap begin}}y = b&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;(y)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;{{nowrap end}}, in the left hand sides.

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

==== Change of base ====
The logarithm log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') can be computed from the logarithms of ''x'' and ''b'' with respect to an arbitrary base ''k'' using the following formula:
: &lt;cite id=labelLogarithmBaseChange&gt;&lt;math&gt; \log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
Typical [[scientific calculators]] calculate the logarithms to bases 10 and [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Bernstein | first1=Stephen | last2=Bernstein | first2=Ruth | title=Schaum's outline of theory and problems of elements of statistics.

:&lt;math&gt; \log_b (x) = \frac{\log_{10} (x)}{\log_{10} (b)} = \frac{\log_{e} (x)}{\log_{e} (b)}. &lt;/math&gt;
Given a number ''x'' and its logarithm log&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') to an unknown base ''b'', the base is given by:
: &lt;math&gt; b = x^\frac{1}{\log_b(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Hyperbolic function identities ===
{{Main|Hyperbolic function}}
The hyperbolic functions satisfy many identities, all of them similar in form to the [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]]. In fact, '''Osborn's rule'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3602492|title=109. Mnemonic for Hyperbolic Formulae|journal=The Mathematical Gazette|first=G.|last=Osborn|date=1 January 1902|publisher=|volume=2|issue=34|pages=189–189|doi=10.2307/3602492}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that one can convert any trigonometric identity into a hyperbolic identity by expanding it completely in terms of integral powers of sines and cosines, changing sine to sinh and cosine to cosh, and switching the sign of every term which contains a product of 2, 6, 10, 14, ... sinhs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Gudermannian function]] gives a direct relationship between the circular functions and the hyperbolic ones that does not involve complex numbers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''majorization inequality''', is a theorem in [[elementary algebra]] for convex and concave real-valued functions, defined on an interval of the real line. It generalizes the discrete form of [[Jensen's inequality]].

==Statement of the inequality==
Let {{math|''I''}} be an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of the [[real line]] and let {{math|''f''}} denote a real-valued, [[convex function]] defined on {{math|''I''}}. If {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are numbers in {{math|''I''}} such that {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} [[majorization|majorizes]] {{math|(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, then

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f(x_1)+\cdots+f(x_n) \ge f(y_1)+\cdots+f(y_n).&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

Here majorization means that {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} satisfies

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;x_1\ge x_2\ge\cdots\ge x_n&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y_1\ge y_2\ge\cdots\ge y_n,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

and we have the inequalities

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;x_1+\cdots+x_i\ge y_1+\cdots+y_i&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n'' − 1}}}.|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

and the equality

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;x_1+\cdots+x_n=y_1+\cdots+y_n&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

If {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is a [[strictly convex function]], then the inequality ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds with equality if and only if we have {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n''}}}.

==Remarks==
* If the convex function {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is [[non-decreasing function|non-decreasing]], then the proof of ({{EquationNote|1}}) below and the discussion of equality in case of strict convexity shows that the equality ({{EquationNote|4}}) can be relaxed to
{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;x_1+\cdots+x_n\ge y_1+\cdots+y_n.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|5}}}}

* The inequality ({{EquationNote|1}}) is reversed if {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is [[concave function|concave]], since in this case the function {{math|−''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is convex.

==Example==
The finite form of [[Jensen's inequality]] is a special case of this result. Consider the real numbers {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''I''}} and let 

:&lt;math&gt;a := \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

denote their [[arithmetic mean]]. Then {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} majorizes the {{math|''n''}}-tuple {{math|(''a'', ''a'', . . . , ''a'')}}, since the arithmetic mean of the {{math|''i''}} largest numbers of {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')}} is at least as large as the arithmetic mean {{math|''a''}} of all the {{math|''n''}} numbers, for every {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n'' − 1}}}. By Karamata's inequality ({{EquationNote|1}}) for the convex function {{math|''f''}},

:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1)+f(x_2)+ \cdots +f(x_n) \ge f(a)+f(a)+\cdots+f(a) = nf(a).&lt;/math&gt; 

Dividing by {{math|''n''}} gives Jensen's inequality. The sign is reversed if {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is concave.

==Proof of the inequality==
We may assume that the numbers are in decreasing order as specified in ({{EquationNote|2}}).

If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n''}}}, then the inequality ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds with equality, hence we may assume in the following that {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for at least one {{math|''i''}}.

If {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for an {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n'' − 1}}}, then the inequality ({{EquationNote|1}}) and the majorization properties ({{EquationNote|3}}) and ({{EquationNote|4}}) are not affected if we remove {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Hence we may assume that {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n'' − 1}}}.

It is a [[convex function#Properties|property of convex functions]] that for two numbers {{math|''x'' ≠ ''y''}} in the interval {{math|''I''}} the [[slope]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}&lt;/math&gt;

of the [[secant line]] through the points {{math|(''x'', ''f''&amp;thinsp;(''x''))}} and {{math|(''y'', ''f''&amp;thinsp;(''y''))}} of the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is a [[monotonically non-decreasing]] function in {{math|''x''}} for {{math|''y''}} fixed (and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice_versa|vice versa]]). This implies that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c_{i+1}:=\frac{f(x_{i+1})-f(y_{i+1})}{x_{i+1}-y_{i+1}}\le\frac{f(x_i)-f(y_i)}{x_i-y_i}=:c_i&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|6}}}}

for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n'' − 1}}}. Define {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and 

:&lt;math&gt;A_i=x_1+\cdots+x_i,\qquad B_i=y_1+\cdots+y_i&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n''}}}. By the majorization property ({{EquationNote|3}}), {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n'' − 1}}} and by ({{EquationNote|4}}), {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Hence,

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^n \bigl(f(x_i) - f(y_i)\bigr)
&amp;=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i (x_i - y_i)\\
&amp;=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \bigl(\underbrace{A_i - A_{i-1}}_{=\,x_i}{} - (\underbrace{B_i - B_{i-1}}_{=\,y_i})\bigr)\\
&amp;=\sum_{i=1}^n c_i (A_i - B_i) - \sum_{i=1}^n c_i (A_{i-1} - B_{i-1})\\
&amp;=c_n (\underbrace{A_n-B_n}_{=\,0}) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(\underbrace{c_i - c_{i + 1}}_{\ge\,0})(\underbrace{A_i - B_i}_{\ge\,0}) - c_1(\underbrace{A_0-B_0}_{=\,0})\\
&amp;\ge0,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|7}}}}

which proves Karamata's inequality ({{EquationNote|1}}).

To discuss the case of equality in ({{EquationNote|1}}), note that {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} by ({{EquationNote|3}}) and our assumption {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for all {{math|''i'' ∈ {1, . . . , ''n'' − 1}}}. Let {{math|''i''}} be the smallest index such that {{math|(''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') ≠ (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, which exists due to ({{EquationNote|4}}). Then {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is strictly convex, then there is strict inequality in ({{EquationNote|6}}), meaning that {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Hence there is a strictly positive term in the sum on the right hand side of ({{EquationNote|7}}) and equality in ({{EquationNote|1}}) cannot hold.

If the convex function {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is non-decreasing, then {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ 0}}. The relaxed condition ({{EquationNote|5}}) means that {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, which is enough to conclude that {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''−''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') ≥ 0}} in the last step of ({{EquationNote|7}}).

If the function {{math|''f''}}&amp;thinsp; is strictly convex and non-decreasing, then {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}. It only remains to discuss the case {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. However, then there is a strictly positive term on the right hand side of ({{EquationNote|7}}) and equality in ({{EquationNote|1}}) cannot hold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3544">In [[cryptography]], a '''known-key distinguishing attack''' is an [[attack model]] against [[symmetric cipher]]s, whereby an attacker who knows the [[key (cryptography)|key]] can find a structural property in cipher, where the transformation from plaintext to ciphertext is not random. There is no common formal definition for what such a transformation may be. The '''chosen-key distinguishing attack''' is strongly related, where the attacker can choose a key to introduce such transformations.&lt;ref name=fse2014&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/222 |authors=Elena Andreeva, Andrey Bogdanov, Bart Mennink |date=8 July 2014 |title=Towards Understanding the Known-Key Security of Block Ciphers |conference=[[Fast Software Encryption|FSE]] 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These attacks do not directly compromise the confidentiality of ciphers, because in a classical scenario, the key is unknown to the attacker. Known-/chosen-key distinguishing attacks apply in the "open key model" instead.&lt;ref name=fse2014 /&gt; They are known to be applicable in some situations where [[block cipher]]s are converted to [[hash function]]s, leading to practical [[collision attack]]s against the hash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.iacr.org/archive/fse2011/67330405/67330405.pdf |authors=Yu Sasaki, Kan Yasuda |date=2011 |title=Known-Key Distinguishers on 11-Round Feistel and Collision Attacks on Its Hashing Modes |conference=[[Fast Software Encryption|FSE]] 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known-key distinguishing attacks were first introduced in 2007 by [[Lars Knudsen]] and [[Vincent Rijmen]]&lt;ref name=fse2014 /&gt; in a paper that proposed such an attack against 7 out of 10 rounds of the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] cipher and another attack against a generalized [[Feistel cipher]]. Their attack finds plaintext/ciphertext pairs for a cipher with a known key, where the input and output have ''s'' least significant bits set to zero, in less than 2&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; time (where ''s'' is fewer than half the [[block size (cryptography)|block size]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2007/48330316/48330316.pdf |authors=[[Lars Knudsen]], [[Vincent Rijmen]] |date=2007 |title=Known-Key Distinguishers for Some Block Ciphers |conference=[[Asiacrypt]] 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These attacks have also been applied to reduced-round [[Threefish]] ([[Skein (hash function)|Skein]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/09/more_skein_news.html |author=[[Bruce Schneier]] |date=1 September 2010 |title=More Skein News |work=Schneier on Security }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dmitry Khovratovich |author2=Ivica Nikolic |author3=Christian Rechberger |date=20 October 2010 |title=Rotational Rebound Attacks on Reduced Skein |url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/538 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Phelix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.431.3015&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |authors=Yaser Esmaeili Salehani, Hadi Ahmadi |date=2006 |title=A Chosen-key Distinguishing Attack on Phelix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3740">In [[category theory]], a '''Krull–Schmidt category''' is a generalization of categories in which the [[Krull–Schmidt theorem]] holds. They arise, for example, in the study of finite-dimensional [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over an [[algebra over a field|algebra]].

== Definition ==

Let ''C'' be an [[additive category]], or more generally an additive [[preadditive category#R-linear categories|{{mvar|R}}-linear category]] for a [[commutative ring]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|R}}. We call ''C'' a '''Krull–Schmidt category''' provided that every object decomposes into a finite direct sum of objects having local endomorphism rings. Equivalently, ''C'' has [[split idempotent]]s and the endomorphism ring of every object is [[perfect ring#semiperfect ring|semiperfect]].

== Properties ==

One has the analogue of the Krull–Schmidt theorem in Krull–Schmidt categories:

An object is called ''indecomposable'' if it is not isomorphic to a direct sum of two nonzero objects. In a Krull–Schmidt category we have that
*an object is indecomposable if and only if its endomorphism ring is local.
*every object is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of indecomposable objects.
*if &lt;math&gt;X_1 \oplus X_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus X_r \cong Y_1 \oplus Y_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus Y_s&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_j&lt;/math&gt; are all indecomposable, then &lt;math&gt;r=s&lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a permutation &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;X_{\pi(i)} \cong Y_i&lt;/math&gt; for all {{mvar|i}}.

One can define the [[Auslander–Reiten quiver]] of a Krull–Schmidt category.

== Examples ==

* An [[abelian category]] in which every object has [[finite length]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the classical case, see for example Krause (2012), Corollary 3.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes as a special case the category of finite-dimensional modules over an algebra.
* The category of finitely-generated modules over a '''finite'''&lt;ref&gt;A finite {{mvar|R}}-algebra is an {{mvar|R}}-algebra which is finitely generated as an {{mvar|R}}-module.&lt;/ref&gt; [[associative algebra|{{mvar|R}}-algebra]], where {{mvar|R}} is a [[commutative]] [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[complete local ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Reiner (2003), Section 6, Exercises 5 and 6, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The category of [[coherent sheaves]] on a [[complete variety]] over an [[algebraically closed|algebraically-closed field]].&lt;ref&gt;Atiyah (1956), Theorem 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A non-example ===

The category of finitely-generated [[projective module]]s over the integers has split idempotents, and every module is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of copies of the regular module, the number being given by the [[invariant basis number|rank]]. Thus the category has unique decomposition into indecomposables, but is not Krull-Schmidt since the regular module does not have a local endomorphism ring.

'''Logic Lane'''&lt;ref&gt;Carr, William, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hzBc2Ur_9YIC&amp;q=Logic+Lane University College]'', [[Routledge]], 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-415-18632-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a small historic cobbled lane that runs through [[University College, Oxford|University College]] in [[Oxford]], [[England]], so called because it was the location of a school of [[List of logicians|logicians]]. It links the [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] at the front of the college with [[Merton Street]] to the rear, which is also cobbled. [[Logic Lane covered bridge]] is a short [[covered bridge]] over the lane at the High Street end (see below).

To the west of the lane are the [[Radcliffe Quad]] and the Master's Lodgings. To the east are the 1903 Durham Buildings (on the High Street) and the [[Goodhart Quad]]. The lane is locked at night (usually at a time earlier than that advertised on the signs at either end of the lane), with gates at each end. It is mainly used by pedestrians, but vehicular access is possible.

During July and August 1960, an [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]] was undertaken to the east of Logic Lane before the construction of the Goodhart Building.&lt;ref name="radcliffe"&gt;Radcliffe, Fabian, Logic Lane Excavations, 1960. ''[[University College Record]]'', Volume III, No. 5, pages 308–310, October 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[Bronze Age]] ditches were found, as well as [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] remains.

== History ==
Logic Lane was formerly known as '''Horseman Lane''' in the 13th and 14th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/high/tour/south/logic_lane.html Logic Lane, Oxford].&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, a [[horse mill]] was located here. It was also known as '''Horsemull Lane'''. The name of Logic Lane was adopted by the 17th century, owing to the presence of a school of logicians at the northern end of the lane.

A medieval street used to run across Logic Lane as an extension of the current [[Kybald Street]] to the west, but was closed in 1448.&lt;ref name="radcliffe" /&gt;

In 1904, a [[covered bridge]] at the High Street end of the lane was built to link the older part of the college with the then new Durham Buildings. The lane was officially a public [[Rights of way in England and Wales|bridleway]], and the city council opposed the scheme, but the court judgement was in favour of the college.

'''László Rédei''' ([[Rákoskeresztúr]], 15 November 1900&amp;mdash;[[Budapest]], 21 November 1980) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[mathematician]].

He graduated from the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] and initially worked as a schoolteacher. In 1940 he was appointed professor in the [[University of Szeged]] and in 1967 moved to the Mathematical Institute of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Budapest]].

His mathematical work was in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[abstract algebra]], especially [[group theory]]. He proved that every finite [[tournament]] contains an odd number of [[Hamiltonian path]]s. He gave several proofs of the theorem on [[quadratic reciprocity]]. He proved important results concerning the invariants of the [[class group]]s of [[Quadratic field|quadratic number field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Engstrom, Howard Theodore|title=Review: ''Sur les Classes d'Idéaux dans les Corps Quadratiques'' by S. Iyanaga|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1937|volume=43|issue=1|pages=12–13|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1937-43-01/S0002-9904-1937-06477-9/S0002-9904-1937-06477-9.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1937-06477-9}} Iyanaga's pamphlet discusses and generalizes one of Rédei's theorems; it gives a "necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an ideal class (in the restricted sense) of order 4 in a quadratic field ''k''({{radic|''D''}}) ..."&lt;/ref&gt; In several cases, he determined if the ring of integers of the real quadratic field '''Q'''({{radic|''d''}}) is Euclidean or not. He successfully generalized [[Hajós's theorem]]. This led him to the investigations of lacunary polynomials over [[finite field]]s, which he eventually published in a book. This work on lacunary polynomials has had a big influence in the field of [[finite geometry]] where it plays an important role in the theory of [[blocking set]]s. He introduced a very general notion of skew product of groups, both the Schreier-extension and the [[Zappa–Szép product]] are special case of. He explicitly determined those finite noncommutative groups whose all proper subgroups were commutative (1947). This is one of the very early results which eventually led to the classification of all [[list of finite simple groups|finite simple groups]].

He was the president of the [[János Bolyai Mathematical Society]] (1947&amp;ndash;1949). He was awarded the Kossuth Prize twice. He was elected corresponding member (1949), full member (1955) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18678">In [[graph theory]], the '''metric dimension''' of a graph ''G'' is the minimum cardinality of a subset ''S'' of vertices such that all other vertices are uniquely determined by their distances to the vertices in ''S''. Finding the metric dimension of a graph is an [[NP-hard]] problem; the decision version, determining whether the metric dimension is less than a given value, is [[NP-complete]].

== Detailed definition ==
For an ordered subset &lt;math&gt;W = \{w_1, w_2,\dots, w_k\}&lt;/math&gt; of vertices and a vertex ''v'' in a connected graph ''G'', the representation of ''v'' with respect to ''W'' is the ordered ''k''-tuple &lt;math&gt;r(v|W) = (d(v,w_1), d(v,w_2),\dots,d(v,w_k))&lt;/math&gt;, where ''d''(''x'',''y'') represents the distance between the vertices ''x'' and ''y''. The set ''W'' is a resolving set (or locating set) for ''G'' if every two vertices of ''G'' have distinct representations. The metric dimension of ''G'' is the minimum cardinality of a resolving set for ''G''. A resolving set containing a minimum number of vertices is called a basis (or reference set) for ''G''. Resolving sets for graphs were introduced independently by {{harvtxt|Slater|1975}} and {{harvtxt|Harary|Melter|1976}}, while the concept of a resolving set and that of metric dimension were defined much earlier by [[Leonard_Blumenthal|Blumenthal]] in his monograph ''Theory and Applications of Distance Geometry''. Graphs are special examples of metric spaces with their intrinsic path metric.

==Trees==
{{harvtxt|Slater|1975}} (see also {{harvtxt|Harary|Melter|1976}} and {{harvtxt|Khuller|Raghavachari|Rosenfeld|1996}}) provides the following simple characterization of the metric dimension of a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. If the tree is a path, its metric dimension is one. Otherwise, let ''L'' denote the set of degree-one vertices in the tree (usually called leaves, although Slater uses that word differently). Let ''K'' be the set of vertices that have degree greater than two, and that are connected by paths of degree-two vertices to one or more leaves. Then the metric dimension is |''L''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;|''K''|. A basis of this cardinality may be formed by removing from ''L'' one of the leaves associated with each vertex in ''K''. The same algorithm is valid for the line graph of the tree, as proved by {{harvtxt|Feng|Xu|Wang|2013}} (and thus any tree and its line graph have the same metric dimension).

==Properties==
In {{harvtxt|Chartrand|Eroh|Johnson|Oellermann|2000}}, it is proved that:
* The metric dimension of a graph {{mvar|G}} is 1 if and only if {{mvar|G}} is a path.
* The metric dimension of an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph is {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 1}} if and only if it is a [[complete graph]].
* The metric dimension of an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph is {{math|''n'' &amp;minus; 2}} if and only if the graph is a [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;''s'', ''t''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, a [[split graph]] &lt;math&gt;K_s+\overline{K_t} (s\geq 1, t\geq 2)&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;K_s+(K_1\cup K_t) (s,t\geq 1) &lt;/math&gt;.

===Relations between the order, the metric dimension and the diameter===

{{harvtxt|Khuller|Raghavachari|Rosenfeld|1996}} prove the inequality &lt;math&gt; n\leq D^{\beta}+\beta&lt;/math&gt; for any {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph with [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] {{mvar|D}} and metric dimension β. This bounds follows from the fact that each vertex that is not in the resolving set is uniquely determined by a distance vector of length β with each entry being an integer between 1 and {{mvar|D}} (there are precisely &lt;math&gt;D^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt; such vectors). However, the bound is only achieved for &lt;math&gt;D\leq 3&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\beta=1&lt;/math&gt;; the more precise bound &lt;math&gt; n\leq \left(\lfloor 2D/3\rfloor+1\right)^\beta+\beta\sum_{i=1}^{\lceil D/3\rceil}(2i-1)^{\beta-1}&lt;/math&gt;  is proved by {{harvtxt|Hernando|Mora|Pelayo|Seara|2010}}.

For specific graph classes, smaller bounds can hold. For example, {{harvtxt|Beaudou|Dankelmann|Foucaud|Henning|2018}} proved that &lt;math&gt;n\leq(\beta D+4)(D+2)/8&lt;/math&gt; for trees (the bound being tight for even values of {{mvar|D}}), and a bound of the form &lt;math&gt;n= O(D^2\beta)&lt;/math&gt; for [[outerplanar graph]]s. The same authors proved that &lt;math&gt;n\leq (D\beta+1)^{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; for graphs with no [[complete graph]] of order {{mvar|t}} as a [[Graph minor|minor]] and also gave bounds for [[chordal graph]]s and graphs of bounded [[treewidth]]. The authors 
{{harvtxt|Foucaud|Mertzios|Naserasr|Parreau|2017a}} proved bounds of the form &lt;math&gt;n= O(D\beta^2)&lt;/math&gt; for [[interval graph]]s and [[permutation graph]]s, and bounds of the form &lt;math&gt;n=O(D\beta)&lt;/math&gt; for [[unit interval graph]]s, bipartite permutation graphs and [[cograph]]s.

==Computational complexity==

===Decision complexity===
Deciding whether the metric dimension of a graph is at most a given integer is NP-complete {{harv|Garey|Johnson|1979}}. It remains NP-complete for bounded-degree [[planar graph]]s {{harv|Díaz|Pottonen|Serna|van Leeuwen|2012}}, [[split graph]]s, [[bipartite graph]]s and their [[complement (graph theory)|complements]], [[line graph]]s of bipartite graphs {{harv|Epstein|Levin|Woeginger|2012}}, [[unit disk graph]]s {{harv|Hoffmann|Wanke|2012}}, [[interval graph]]s of diameter 2 and [[permutation graph]]s of diameter 2 {{harv|Foucaud|Mertzios|Naserasr|Parreau|2017b}}. 

For any fixed constant ''k'', the graphs of metric dimension at most ''k'' can be recognized in [[polynomial time]], by testing all possible ''k''-tuples of vertices, but this algorithm is not [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] (for the natural parameter ''k'', the solution size). Answering a question posed by {{harvtxt|Lokshtanov|2010}}, {{harvtxt|Hartung|Nichterlein|2013}} show that the metric dimension decision problem is complete for the parameterized complexity class W[2], implying that a time bound of the form ''n''&lt;sup&gt;O(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; as achieved by this naive algorithm is likely optimal and that a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (for the parameterization by ''k'') is unlikely to exist. Nevertheless, the problem becomes [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]] when restricted to [[interval graph]]s {{harv|Foucaud|Mertzios|Naserasr|Parreau|2017b}}, and more generally to graphs of bounded tree-length {{harv|Belmonte|Fomin|Golovach|Ramanujan|2015}}, such as [[chordal graph]]s, [[permutation graph]]s or asteroidal-triple-free graphs.

Deciding whether the metric dimension of a tree is at most a given integer can be done in linear time ({{harvnb|Slater|1975}}; {{harvnb|Harary|Melter|1976}}). Other linear-time algorithms exist for [[cograph]]s {{harv|Epstein|Levin|Woeginger|2012}}, [[chain graph]]s {{harv|Fernau|Heggernes|van 't Hof|Meister|2015}} and cactus block graphs {{harv|Hoffmann|Elterman|Wanke|2016}} (a class including both [[cactus graph]]s and [[block graph]]s). The problem may be solved in polynomial time on [[outerplanar graph]]s {{harv|Díaz|Pottonen|Serna|van Leeuwen|2012}}. It may also be solved in polynomial time for graphs of bounded [[cyclomatic number]] {{harv|Epstein|Levin|Woeginger|2012}}, but this algorithm is again not fixed-parameter tractable (for the parameter "cyclomatic number") because the exponent in the polynomial depends on the cyclomatic number. There exist fixed-parameter tractable algorithms to solve the metric dimension problem for the parameters "[[vertex cover]]" {{harv|Hartung|Nichterlein|2013}}, "max leaf number" {{harv|Eppstein|2015}} and "modular width" {{harv|Belmonte|Fomin|Golovach|Ramanujan|2015}}. Graphs with bounded cyclomatic number, vertex cover number or max leaf number all have bounded [[treewidth]], however it is an open problem to determine the complexity of the metric dimension problem even on graphs of treewidth 2, that is, [[series-parallel graph]]s {{harv|Belmonte|Fomin|Golovach|Ramanujan|2015}}.

===Approximation complexity===
The metric dimension of an arbitrary ''n''-vertex graph may be approximated in polynomial time to within an [[Approximation algorithm|approximation ratio]] of &lt;math&gt;2\log n&lt;/math&gt; by expressing it as a [[set cover problem]], a problem of covering all of a given collection of elements by as few sets as possible in a given [[family of sets]]  {{harv|Khuller|Raghavachari|Rosenfeld|1996}}. In the set cover problem formed from a metric dimension problem, the elements to be covered are the &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt; pairs of vertices to be distinguished, and the sets that can cover them are the sets of pairs that can be distinguished by a single chosen vertex. The approximation bound then follows by applying standard approximation algorithms for set cover. An alternative [[greedy algorithm]] that chooses vertices according to the difference in [[entropy]] between the equivalence classes of distance vectors before and after the choice achieves an even better approximation ratio, &lt;math&gt;\log n+\log\log_2 n+1&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Hauptmann|Schmied|Viehmann|2012}}. This approximation ratio is close to best possible, as under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions a ratio of &lt;math&gt;(1-\epsilon)\log n&lt;/math&gt; cannot be achieved in polynomial time for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Hauptmann|Schmied|Viehmann|2012}}. The latter hardness of approximation still holds for instances restricted to subcubic graphs {{harv|Hartung|Nichterlein|2013}}, and even to [[Bipartite_graph|bipartite]] subcubic graphs as shown in Hartung's PhD thesis {{harv|Hartung|2014}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2113">A '''modal connective''' (or '''modal operator''') is a [[logical connective]] for [[modal logic]]. It is an [[binary function|operator]] which forms [[proposition]]s from propositions. In general, a modal operator has the "formal" property of being non-[[truth function|truth-functional]], and is "intuitively" characterized by expressing a modal attitude (such as [[Logical truth|necessity]], [[Logical possibility|possibility]], [[belief]], or [[knowledge]]) about the proposition to which the operator is applied. 

== Modality interpreted ==
There are several ways to [[interpretation (logic)|interpret]] modal operators in modal logic, including:
[[alethic modality|alethic]], [[deontic logic|deontic]], [[axiology|axiological]], [[epistemic modal logic|epistemic]], and [[doxastic logic|doxastic]].

===Alethic===
[[Alethic modality|Alethic]] modal operators (M-operators) determine the fundamental conditions of [[possible worlds]], especially [[causality]], time-space parameters, and the action capacity of persons. They indicate the [[logical possibility|possibility]], [[impossibility]] and [[Logical truth|necessity]] of actions, states of affairs, events, people, and qualities in the possible worlds. 

=== Deontic ===
[[Deontic logic|Deontic]] modal operators (P-operators) influence the construction of possible worlds as proscriptive or prescriptive norms, i.e. they indicate what is prohibited, obligatory, or permitted. 

=== Axiological ===
[[Axiology|Axiological]] modal operators (G-operators) transform the world's [[entities]] into values and disvalues as seen by a social group, a culture, or a historical period. Axiological modalities are highly subjective categories: what is good for one person may be considered as bad by another one. 

=== Epistemic ===
[[Epistemic logic|Epistemic]] modal operators (K-operators) reflect the level of knowledge, ignorance and belief in the possible world. 

=== Doxastic ===

[[Doxastic logic|Doxastic]] modal operators express belief in statements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41356">In [[mathematical logic]], '''New Foundations''' ('''NF''') is an [[axiomatic set theory]], conceived by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] as a simplification of the [[theory of types]] of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Quine first proposed NF in a 1937 article titled "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic"; hence the name. Much of this entry discusses '''NFU''', an important variant of NF due to Jensen (1969) and exposited in Holmes (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Randall, 1998. ''[http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/head.pdf Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]''. Academia-Bruylant.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 and in a revision of 1951 Quine introduced an extension of NF sometimes called "Mathematical Logic" or "ML", that included proper classes  as well as sets.

New Foundations has a universal set, so it is a non-well founded set theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine-nf/ Quine's New Foundations] - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, it is an axiomatic set theory that allows infinite descending chains of membership such as
…&amp;nbsp;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ …x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. It avoids Russell's paradox by permitting only stratifiable formulae to be defined using the axiom (schema) of comprehension. For instance x ∈ y is a stratifiable formula, but x ∈ x is not (for details of how this works see below).

==The type theory TST==
The primitive predicates of Russellian unramified typed set theory (TST), a streamlined version of the [[Type theory|theory of types]], are equality (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;) and membership (&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;). TST has a linear hierarchy of types: type 0 consists of individuals otherwise undescribed. For each (meta-) natural number ''n'', type ''n''+1 objects are sets of type ''n'' objects; sets of type ''n'' have members of type ''n''-1. Objects connected by identity must have the same type. The following two atomic formulas succinctly describe the typing rules: &lt;math&gt;x^{n} = y^{n}\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{n} \in y^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. (Quinean set theory seeks to eliminate the need for such superscripts.)

The axioms of TST are:
*[[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]: sets of the same (positive) type with the same members are equal;
*An axiom schema of [[axiom of separation|comprehension]], namely:
:If &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)\!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[well-formed formula|formula]], then the set &lt;math&gt;\{x^n \mid \phi(x^n)\}^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; exists.

:In other words, given any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)\!&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;\exists A^{n+1} \forall x^n [ x^n \in A^{n+1} \leftrightarrow \phi(x^n) ]&lt;/math&gt; is an axiom where &lt;math&gt;A^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; represents the set &lt;math&gt;\{x^n \mid \phi(x^n)\}^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; and is not free in &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)&lt;/math&gt;.

This type theory is much less complicated than the one first set out in the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which included types for [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] whose arguments were not necessarily all of the same type. In 1914, [[Norbert Wiener]] showed how to code the [[ordered pair]] as a set of sets, making it possible to eliminate relation types in favor of the linear hierarchy of sets described here.

== Quinean set theory==

===Axioms and stratification===

The well-formed formulas of New Foundations (NF) are the same as the well-formed formulas of TST, but with the type annotations erased. The axioms of NF are:

*[[Extensionality]]: Two objects with the same elements are the same object;
*A [[axiom of separation|comprehension schema]]: All instances of TST ''Comprehension'' but with type indices dropped (and without introducing new identifications between variables).

By convention, NF's ''[[axiom of separation|Comprehension]]'' schema is stated using the concept of [[stratified formula]] and making no direct reference to types. A formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[stratified formula|stratified]] if there exists a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from pieces of syntax to the natural numbers, such that for any atomic subformula &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; we have ''f''(''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + 1, while for any atomic subformula &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, we have ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y''). ''Comprehension'' then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi \}&lt;/math&gt; exists for each [[stratified formula]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Even the indirect reference to types implicit in the notion of [[stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] can be eliminated. [[Theodore Hailperin]] showed in 1944 that ''Comprehension'' is equivalent to a finite conjunction of its instances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hailperin | first1 = T | year = | title = A set of axioms for logic | url = | journal = [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.2307/2267307}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that NF can be finitely axiomatized without any reference to the notion of type.

''Comprehension'' may seem to run afoul of problems similar to those in [[naive set theory]], but this is not the case. For example, the existence of the impossible [[Russell's paradox|Russell class]] &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x \not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt; is not an axiom of NF, because &lt;math&gt; x \not\in x &lt;/math&gt; cannot be stratified.

=== Ordered pairs===
[[Relation (mathematics)|Relations]] and [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are defined in TST (and in NF and NFU) as sets of [[ordered pair]]s in the usual way. The usual definition of the ordered pair, first proposed by [[Kuratowski]] in 1921, has a serious drawback for NF and related theories: the resulting ordered pair necessarily has a type two higher than the type of its arguments (its left and right [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s). Hence for purposes of determining stratification, a function is three types higher than the members of its field.

If one can define a pair in such a way that its type is the same type as that of its arguments (resulting in a '''type-level''' ordered pair), then a relation or function is merely one type higher than the type of the members of its field. Hence NF and related theories usually employ [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s set-theoretic definition of the 
ordered pair, which yields a [[Ordered pair#Quine-Rosser definition|type-level ordered pair]]. Holmes (1998) takes the ordered pair and its left and right [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s as primitive. Fortunately, whether the ordered pair is type-level by definition or by assumption (i.e., taken as primitive) usually does not matter.

The existence of a type-level ordered pair implies ''Infinity'', and NFU + ''Infinity'' interprets NFU + "there is a type level ordered pair" (they are not quite the same theory, but the differences are inessential). Conversely, NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice'' proves the existence of a type-level ordered pair.

===Admissibility of useful large sets===
NF (and NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice'', described below and known consistent) allow the construction of two kinds of sets that [[ZFC]] and its proper extensions disallow because they are "too large" (some set theories admit these entities under the heading of [[proper class]]es):
*''The [[universal set]] V''. Because &lt;math&gt;x=x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[stratified formula]], the [[universal set]] ''V'' = {''x'' | ''x=x''} exists by ''Comprehension''. An immediate consequence is that all sets have [[complement (set theory)|complements]], and the entire set-theoretic universe under NF has a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean]] structure.
*''[[cardinal number|Cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers''. In NF (and TST), the set of all sets having ''n'' elements (the [[circular reasoning|circularity]] here is only apparent) exists. Hence [[Frege]]'s definition of the cardinal numbers works in NF and NFU: a cardinal number is an [[equivalence class]] of sets under the [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] of [[equinumerosity]]: the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous if there exists a [[bijection]] between them, in which case we write &lt;math&gt;A \sim B&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, an ordinal number is an [[equivalence class]] of [[well-ordering|well-ordered]] sets.

==Finite axiomatizability==

New Foundations can be [[Axiom schema#Finite axiomatization|finitely axiomatized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hailperin | first1 = T | year = | title = A set of axioms for logic | url = | journal = [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.2307/2267307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton, Scott, 2015. ''[http://us.metamath.org/nfegif/mmnf.html New Foundations Explorer Home Page]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian closure==
The category whose objects are the sets of NF and whose arrows are the functions between those sets is not [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/cartesian-closed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;; Cartesian closure can be a useful property for a category of sets. Since NF lacks Cartesian closure, not every function [[currying|curries]] as one might intuitively expect, and NF is not a [[topos]].

==The consistency problem and related partial results==
The outstanding problem with NF is that it is not yet verified to be [[equiconsistency|relatively consistent]] to any mainstream mathematical system. NF disproves ''Choice'', and so proves ''Infinity'' (Specker, 1953). But it is also known ([[Ronald Jensen|Jensen]], 1969) that allowing [[urelement]]s (multiple distinct objects lacking members) yields NFU, a theory that is consistent relative to [[Peano arithmetic]]; if Infinity and Choice are added, the resulting theory has the same consistency strength as type theory with infinity or bounded Zermelo set theory. (NFU corresponds to a type theory TSTU, where type 0 has urelements, not just a single empty set.) There are other relatively consistent variants of NF.

NFU is, roughly speaking, weaker than NF because in NF, the power set of the universe is the universe itself, while in NFU, the power set of the universe may be strictly smaller than the universe (the power set of the universe contains only sets, while the universe may contain urelements). In fact, this is necessarily the case in NFU+"Choice".

Specker has shown that NF is [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]] with TST + ''Amb'', where ''Amb'' is the axiom scheme of '''typical ambiguity''' which asserts &lt;math&gt;\phi \leftrightarrow \phi^+&lt;/math&gt; for any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi^+&lt;/math&gt; being the formula obtained by raising every type index in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; by one. NF is also equiconsistent with the theory TST augmented with a "type shifting automorphism", an operation which raises type by one, mapping each type onto the next higher type, and preserves equality and membership relations (and which cannot be used in instances of ''Comprehension'': it is external to the theory). The same results hold for various fragments of TST in relation to the corresponding fragments of NF.

In the same year (1969) that [[Ronald Jensen|Jensen]] proved NFU consistent, Grishin proved &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; consistent. &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; is the fragment of NF with full extensionality (no urelements) and those instances of ''Comprehension'' which can be stratified using just three types. This theory is a very awkward medium for mathematics (although there have been attempts to alleviate this awkwardness), largely because there is no obvious definition for an [[ordered pair]]. Despite this awkwardness, &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; is very interesting because ''every'' infinite model of TST restricted to three types satisfies ''Amb''. Hence for every such model there is a model of &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; with the same theory. This does not hold for four types: &lt;math&gt;NF_4&lt;/math&gt; is the same theory as NF, and we have no idea how to obtain a model of TST with four types in which ''Amb'' holds.

In 1983, Marcel Crabbé proved consistent a system he called NFI, whose axioms are unrestricted extensionality and those instances of ''Comprehension'' in which no variable is assigned a type higher than that of the set asserted to exist. This is a [[impredicative|predicativity]] restriction, though NFI is not a predicative theory: it admits enough impredicativity to define the set of natural numbers (defined as the intersection of all inductive sets; note that the inductive sets quantified over are of the same type as the set of natural numbers being defined). Crabbé also discussed a subtheory of NFI, in which only parameters (free variables) are allowed to have the type of the set asserted to exist by an instance of ''Comprehension''. He called the result "predicative NF" (NFP); it is, of course, doubtful whether any theory with a self-membered universe is truly predicative. Holmes has {{date?}} shown that NFP has the same consistency strength as the predicative theory of types of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' without the [[Axiom of reducibility]].

Since 2015, several candidate proofs by Randall Holmes of the consistency of NF relative to ZF have been available both on arxiv and on the logician's home page. Holmes demonstrates the equiconsistency of a 'weird' variant of TST, namely TTT&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; - 'tangled type theory with λ-types'  - with NF.  Holmes next shows that TTT&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent relative to ZFA that is, ZF with atoms but without choice.  Holmes demonstrates this by constructing in ZFA+C that is ZF with atoms and choice, a class model of ZFA which includes 'tangled webs of cardinals' . The candidate proofs are all rather long, but no irrecoverable faults have been identified by the NF community so far.

==How NF(U) avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes==
NF steers clear of the three well-known [[paradox]]es of [[set theory]]. That NFU, a [[Consistency|consistent]] (relative to Peano arithmetic) theory, also avoids the paradoxes may increase one's confidence in this fact.

The ''[[Russell paradox]]'': An easy matter; &lt;math&gt;x \not\in x&lt;/math&gt; is not a stratified formula, so the existence of &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x \not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt; is not asserted by any instance of ''Comprehension''. Quine said that he constructed NF with this paradox uppermost in mind.

''[[Cantor's paradox]]'' of the largest [[cardinal number]] exploits the application of [[Cantor's theorem]] to the [[universal set]]. [[Cantor's theorem]] says (given ZFC) that the [[power set]] &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is larger than &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (there can be no [[Injective function|injection]] (one-to-one map) from &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;). Now of course there is an [[Injective function|injection]] from &lt;math&gt;P(V)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the universal set! The resolution requires that one observes that &lt;math&gt;|A| &lt; |P(A)|&lt;/math&gt; makes no sense in the theory of types: the type of &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is one higher than the type of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The correctly typed version (which is a theorem in the theory of types for essentially the same reasons that the original form of [[Cantor's theorem]] works in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]]) is &lt;math&gt;|P_1(A)| &lt; |P(A)|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_1(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of one-element subsets of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The specific instance of this theorem of interest is &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)| &lt; |P(V)|&lt;/math&gt;: there are fewer one-element sets than sets (and so fewer one-element sets than general objects, if we are in NFU). The "obvious" [[bijection]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \{x\}&lt;/math&gt; from the universe to the one-element sets is not a set; it is not a set because its definition is unstratified. Note that in all known models of NFU it is the case that &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)| &lt; |P(V)| &lt;&lt; |V|&lt;/math&gt;; ''Choice'' allows one not only to prove that there are urelements but that there are many cardinals between &lt;math&gt;|P(V)|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|V|&lt;/math&gt;.

One can now introduce some useful notions. A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the intuitively appealing &lt;math&gt;|A| = |P_1(A)|&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''Cantorian''': a Cantorian set satisfies the usual form of [[Cantor's theorem]]. A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the further condition that &lt;math&gt;(x \mapsto \{x\})\lceil A&lt;/math&gt;, the [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] map to ''A'', is a set is not only Cantorian set but '''strongly Cantorian'''.

The ''[[Burali-Forti paradox]]'' of the largest [[ordinal number]] goes as follows. Define (following [[naive set theory]]) the ordinals as [[equivalence class]]es of [[well-ordering]]s under [[isomorphism]]. There is an obvious natural well-ordering on the ordinals; since it is a well-ordering it belongs to an ordinal &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to prove (by [[transfinite induction]]) that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than a given ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; itself. But this means that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; and so is strictly less than the order type of all the ordinals — but the latter is, by definition, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; itself!

The solution to the paradox in NF(U) starts with the observation that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is of a higher type than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Hence a type level [[ordered pair]] is two types higher than the type of its arguments and the usual Kuratowski ordered pair four types higher. For any order type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we can define an order type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; one type higher: if &lt;math&gt;W \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the order &lt;math&gt;W^{\iota} = \{(\{x\},\{y\}) \mid xWy\}&lt;/math&gt;. The triviality of the T operation is only a seeming one; it is easy to show that T is a strictly [[monotonic function|monotone]] (order preserving) operation on the ordinals.

Now the lemma on order types may be restated in a stratified manner: the order type of the natural order on the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T^2(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;T^4(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
depending on which pair is used (we assume the type level pair hereinafter). From this one may deduce that the order type on the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus  &lt;math&gt;T^2(\Omega)&lt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the T operation is not a function; there cannot be a strictly monotone set map from ordinals to ordinals which sends an ordinal downward! Since T is monotone, we have &lt;math&gt;\Omega &gt; T^2(\Omega) &gt; T^4(\Omega)\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, a "descending sequence" in the ordinals which cannot be a set.

One might assert that this result shows that no model of NF(U) is "standard", since the ordinals in any model of NFU are externally not well-ordered. One need not take a position on this, but can note that it is also a theorem of NFU that any set model of NFU has non-well-ordered "ordinals"; NFU does not conclude that the universe ''V'' is a model of NFU, despite ''V'' being a set, because the membership relation is not a set relation.

For a further development of mathematics in NFU, with a comparison to the development of the same in ZFC, see [[implementation of mathematics in set theory]].

==The system ML (Mathematical Logic) ==

ML is an extension of NF that includes proper classes as well as sets.
The set theory of the 1940 first edition of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s ''Mathematical Logic'' married NF to the [[proper class]]es of [[Von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory|NBG set theory]], and included an axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension for proper classes. However {{harvs|txt|first=J. Barkley|last= Rosser|authorlink=J. Barkley Rosser|year=1942}} proved that the system presented in ''Mathematical Logic'' was subject to the Burali-Forti paradox. This result does not apply to NF. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Hao Wang (academic)|first=Hao |last=Wang|year=1950}} showed how to amend Quine's axioms for ML so as to avoid this problem, and Quine included the resulting axiomatization in the 1951 second and final edition of ''Mathematical Logic''.

Wang proved that if NF is consistent then so is the revised ML, and also showed that the revised ML can prove the consistency of NF, that is that NF and  the revised ML are equiconsistent.

==Models of NFU==
There is a fairly simple method for producing models of NFU in bulk. Using well-known techniques of [[model theory]], one can construct a nonstandard model of [[Zermelo set theory]] (nothing nearly as strong as full ZFC is needed for the basic technique) on which there is an external automorphism ''j'' (not a set of the model) which moves a [[rank (set theory)|rank]] &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; of the cumulative [[hierarchy]] of sets. We may suppose without loss of generality that &lt;math&gt;j(\alpha)&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We talk about the [[automorphism]] moving the rank rather than the ordinal because we do not want to assume that every ordinal in the model is the index of a rank.

The domain of the model of NFU will be the nonstandard rank &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. The membership relation of the model of NFU will be

*&lt;math&gt;x \in_{NFU} y \equiv_{def} j(x) \in y \wedge y \in V_{j(\alpha)+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

It may now be proved that this actually is a model of NFU. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be a stratified formula in the language of NFU. Choose an assignment of types to all variables in the formula which witnesses the fact that it is stratified. Choose a natural number ''N'' greater than all types assigned to variables by this stratification.

Expand the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; into a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; in the language of the nonstandard model of [[Zermelo set theory]] with [[automorphism]] ''j'' using the definition of membership in the model of NFU. Application of any power of ''j'' to both sides of an equation or membership statement preserves its [[truth value]] because ''j'' is an automorphism. Make such an application to each [[atomic formula]] in &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that each variable ''x'' assigned type ''i'' occurs with exactly &lt;math&gt;N-i&lt;/math&gt; applications of ''j''. This is possible thanks to the form of the atomic membership statements derived from NFU membership statements, and to the formula being stratified. Each quantified sentence &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \in V_{\alpha}.\psi(j^{N-i}(x)))&lt;/math&gt; can be converted to the form &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \in j^{N-i}(V_{\alpha}).\psi(x))&lt;/math&gt; (and similarly for [[existential quantifier]]s). Carry out this transformation everywhere and obtain a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; in which ''j'' is never applied to a bound variable.

Choose any free variable ''y'' in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; assigned type ''i''. Apply &lt;math&gt;j^{i-N}&lt;/math&gt; uniformly to the entire formula to obtain a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_3&lt;/math&gt; in which ''y'' appears without any application of ''j''. Now &lt;math&gt;\{y \in V_{\alpha} \mid \phi_3\}&lt;/math&gt; exists (because ''j'' appears applied only to free variables and constants), belongs to &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and contains exactly those ''y'' which satisfy the original formula
&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the model of NFU. &lt;math&gt;j(\{y \in V_{\alpha} \mid \phi_3\})&lt;/math&gt; has this extension in the model of NFU (the application of ''j'' corrects for the different definition of membership in the model of NFU). This establishes that ''Stratified Comprehension'' holds in the model of NFU.

To see that weak ''Extensionality'' holds is straightforward: each nonempty element of &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)+1}&lt;/math&gt; inherits a unique extension from the nonstandard model, the empty set inherits its usual extension as well, and all other objects are urelements.

The basic idea is that the automorphism ''j'' codes the "power set" &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; of our "universe" &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; into its externally isomorphic copy &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)+1}&lt;/math&gt; inside our "universe." The remaining objects not coding subsets of the universe are treated as [[urelement]]s.

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number ''n'', one gets a model of NFU which claims that the universe is finite (it is externally infinite, of course). If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is infinite and the ''[[Axiom of Choice|Choice]]'' holds in the nonstandard model of ZFC, one obtains a model of NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice''.

=== Self-sufficiency of mathematical foundations in NFU ===
For philosophical reasons, it is important to note that it is not necessary to work in [[ZFC]] or any related system to carry out this proof. A common argument against the use of NFU as a foundation for mathematics is that the reasons for relying on it have to do with the intuition that ZFC is correct. It is sufficient to accept TST (in fact TSTU). In outline: take the type theory TSTU (allowing urelements in each positive type) as a metatheory and consider the theory of set models of TSTU in TSTU (these models will be sequences of sets &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; (all of the same type in the metatheory) with embeddings of each &lt;math&gt;P(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P_1(T_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt; coding embeddings of the power set of &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; in a type-respecting manner). Given an embedding of &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; (identifying elements of the base "type" with subsets of the base type), embeddings may be defined from each "type" into its successor in a natural way. This can be generalized to transfinite sequences &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; with care.

Note that the construction of such sequences of sets is limited by the size of the type in which they are being constructed; this prevents TSTU from proving its own consistency (TSTU + ''Infinity'' can prove the consistency of TSTU; to prove the consistency of TSTU+''Infinity'' one needs a type containing a set of cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, which cannot be proved to exist in TSTU+''Infinity'' without stronger assumptions). Now the same results of model theory can be used to build a model of NFU and verify that it is a model of NFU in much the same way, with the &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;'s being used in place of &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; in the usual construction. The final move is to observe that since NFU is consistent, we can drop the use of absolute types in our metatheory, bootstrapping the metatheory from TSTU to NFU.

=== Facts about the automorphism ''j'' ===
The [[automorphism]] ''j'' of a model of this kind is closely related to certain natural operations in NFU. For example, if ''W'' is a [[well-ordering]] in the nonstandard model (we suppose here that we use [[ordered pair|Kuratowski pairs]] so that the coding of functions in the two theories will agree to some extent) which is also a well-ordering in NFU (all well-orderings of NFU are well-orderings in the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory, but not vice versa, due to the formation of [[urelement]]s in the construction of the model), and ''W'' has type α in NFU, then ''j''(''W'') will be a well-ordering of type ''T''(α) in NFU.

In fact, ''j'' is coded by a function in the model of NFU. The function in the nonstandard model which sends the singleton of any element of &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; to its sole element, becomes in NFU a function which sends each singleton {''x''}, where ''x'' is any object in the universe, to ''j''(''x''). Call this function ''Endo'' and let it have the following properties: ''Endo'' is an [[Injective function|injection]] from the set of singletons into the set of sets, with the property that ''Endo''( {''x''} ) = {''Endo''( {''y''} ) | ''y''∈''x''} for each set ''x''. This function can define a type level "membership" relation on the universe, one reproducing the membership relation of the original nonstandard model.

==Strong axioms of infinity==
In this section the effect is considered of adding various "strong axioms of infinity" to our usual base theory, NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice''. This base theory, known consistent, has the same strength as TST + ''Infinity'', or Zermelo set theory with ''Separation'' restricted to bounded formulas (Mac Lane set theory).

One can add to this base theory strong axioms of infinity familiar from the [[ZFC]] context, such as "there exists an inaccessible cardinal," but it is more natural to consider assertions about Cantorian and strongly Cantorian sets. Such assertions not only bring into being [[large cardinal]]s of the usual sorts, but strengthen the theory on its own terms.

The weakest of the usual strong principles is:

*'''Rosser's Axiom of Counting'''. The set of natural numbers is a strongly Cantorian set.

To see how natural numbers are defined in NFU, see [[set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]]. The original form of this axiom given by Rosser was "the set {''m''|1≤''m''≤''n''} has ''n'' members", for each natural number ''n''. This intuitively obvious assertion is unstratified: what is provable in NFU is "the set {''m''|1≤''m''≤''n''} has &lt;math&gt;T^2(n)&lt;/math&gt; members" (where the ''T'' operation on cardinals is defined by &lt;math&gt;T(|A|) = |P_1(A)|&lt;/math&gt;; this raises the type of a cardinal by one). For any cardinal number (including natural numbers) to assert &lt;math&gt;T(|A|) = |A|&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to asserting that the sets ''A'' of that cardinality are Cantorian (by a usual abuse of language, we refer to such cardinals as "Cantorian cardinals"). It is straightforward to show that the assertion that each natural number is Cantorian is equivalent to the assertion that the set of all natural numbers is strongly Cantorian.

''Counting'' is consistent with NFU, but increases its consistency strength noticeably; not, as one would expect, in the area of arithmetic, but in higher set theory. NFU + ''Infinity'' proves that each &lt;math&gt;\beth_n&lt;/math&gt; exists, but not that &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; exists; NFU + ''Counting'' (easily) proves ''Infinity'', and further proves the existence of &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beth_n}&lt;/math&gt; for each n, but not the existence of &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beth_{\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[beth number]]s).

''Counting'' implies immediately that one does not need to assign types to variables restricted to the set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers for purposes of stratification; it is a theorem that the [[power set]] of a strongly Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian, so it is further not necessary to assign types to variables restricted to any iterated power set of the natural numbers, or to such familiar sets as the set of real numbers, the set of functions from reals to reals, and so forth. The set-theoretical strength of ''Counting'' is less important in practice than the convenience of not having to annotate variables known to have natural number values (or related kinds of values) with singleton brackets, or to apply the ''T'' operation in order to get stratified set definitions.

''Counting'' implies ''Infinity''; each of the axioms below needs to be adjoined to NFU + ''Infinity'' to get the effect of strong variants of ''Infinity''; [[Ali Enayat]] has investigated the strength of some of these axioms in models of NFU + "the universe is finite".

A model of the kind constructed above satisfies ''Counting'' just in case the automorphism ''j'' fixes all natural numbers in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory.

The next strong axiom we consider is the

*'''Axiom of strongly Cantorian separation''': For any strongly Cantorian set ''A'' and any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily stratified!) the set {''x''∈''A''|φ} exists.

Immediate consequences include Mathematical Induction for unstratified conditions (which is not a consequence of ''Counting''; many but not all unstratified instances of induction on the natural numbers follow from ''Counting'').

This axiom is surprisingly strong. Unpublished work of [[Robert Solovay]] shows that the consistency strength of the theory NFU* = NFU + ''Counting'' + ''Strongly Cantorian Separation'' is the same as that of Zermelo set theory + &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; ''Replacement''.

This axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with ''Choice'') if the ordinals which are fixed by ''j'' and dominate only ordinals fixed by ''j'' in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory are standard, and the power set of any such ordinal in the model is also standard. This condition is sufficient but not necessary.

Next is

*'''Axiom of Cantorian Sets''': Every Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian.

This very simple and appealing assertion is extremely strong. Solovay has shown the precise equivalence of the consistency strength of the theory NFUA = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Cantorian Sets'' with that of ZFC + a schema asserting the existence of an ''n''-Mahlo cardinal for each concrete natural number ''n''. Ali Enayat has shown that the theory of Cantorian equivalence classes of well-founded extensional relations (which gives a natural picture of an initial segment of the cumulative hierarchy of ZFC) interprets the extension of ZFC with ''n''-Mahlo cardinals directly. A permutation technique can be applied to a model of this theory to give a model in which the hereditarily strongly Cantorian sets with the usual membership relation model the strong extension of ZFC.

This axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with ''Choice'') just in case the ordinals fixed by ''j'' in the underlying nonstandard model of [[ZFC]] are an initial (proper class) segment of the ordinals of the model.

Next consider the

*'''Axiom of Cantorian Separation''': For any Cantorian set A and any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily stratified!) the set {''x''∈''A''|φ} exists.

This combines the effect of the two preceding axioms and is actually even stronger (precisely how is not known). Unstratified mathematical induction enables proving that there are ''n''-Mahlo cardinals for every ''n'', given ''Cantorian Sets'', which gives an extension of [[ZFC]] that is even stronger than the previous one, which only asserts that there are ''n''-Mahlos for each concrete natural number (leaving open the possibility of nonstandard counterexamples).

This axiom will hold in a model of the kind described above if every ordinal fixed by ''j'' is standard, and every [[power set]] of an ordinal fixed by ''j'' is also standard in the underlying model of [[ZFC]]. Again, this condition is sufficient but not necessary.

An ordinal is said to be ''Cantorian'' if it is fixed by ''T'', and ''strongly Cantorian'' if it dominates only Cantorian ordinals (this implies that it is itself Cantorian). In models of the kind constructed above, Cantorian ordinals of NFU correspond to ordinals fixed by ''j'' (they are not the same objects because different definitions of ordinal numbers are used in the two theories).

Equal in strength to ''Cantorian Sets'' is the

*'''Axiom of Large Ordinals''': For each non-Cantorian ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural number ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega) &lt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Recall that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the natural order on all ordinals. This only implies ''Cantorian Sets'' if we have ''Choice'' (but is at that level of consistency strength in any case). It is remarkable that one can even define &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;: this is the ''n''th term &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; of any finite sequence of ordinals ''s'' of length ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;s_0 = \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s_{i+1} = T(s_i)&lt;/math&gt; for each appropriate ''i''. This definition is completely unstratified. The uniqueness of &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; can be proved (for those ''n'' for which it exists) and a certain amount of common-sense reasoning about this notion can be carried out, enough to show that ''Large Ordinals'' implies ''Cantorian Sets'' in the presence of ''Choice''. In spite of the knotty formal statement of this axiom, it is a very natural assumption, amounting to making the action of ''T'' on the ordinals as simple as possible.

A model of the kind constructed above will satisfy ''Large Ordinals'', if the ordinals moved by ''j'' are exactly the ordinals which dominate some &lt;math&gt;j^{-i}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; in the underlying nonstandard model of [[ZFC]].

*'''Axiom of Small Ordinals''': For any formula φ, there is a set ''A'' such that the elements of ''A'' which are strongly Cantorian ordinals are exactly the strongly Cantorian ordinals such that φ.

Solovay has shown the precise equivalence in consistency strength of NFUB = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Cantorian Sets'' + ''Small Ordinals'' with [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] plus the assertion that the proper class ordinal (the class of all ordinals) is a [[weakly compact cardinal]]. This is very strong indeed! Moreover, NFUB-, which is NFUB with ''Cantorian Sets'' omitted, is easily seen to have the same strength as NFUB.

A model of the kind constructed above will satisfy this axiom if every collection of ordinals fixed by ''j'' is the intersection of some set of ordinals with the ordinals fixed by ''j'', in the underlying nonstandard model of ZFC.

Even stronger is the theory NFUM = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Large Ordinals'' + ''Small Ordinals''. This is equivalent to [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] with a predicate on the classes which is a κ-complete nonprincipal [[ultrafilter]] on the proper class ordinal κ; in effect, this is Morse–Kelley set theory + "the proper class ordinal is a [[measurable cardinal]]"!

The technical details here are not the main point, which is that reasonable and natural (in the context of NFU) assertions turn out to be equivalent in power to very strong axioms of infinity in the [[ZFC]] context. This fact is related to the correlation between the existence of models of NFU, described above and satisfying these axioms, and the existence of models of [[ZFC]] with [[automorphism]]s having special properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">In [[applied mathematics]], the '''phase space method''' is a technique for constructing and analyzing solutions of [[dynamical system]]s, that is, solving time-dependent [[differential equations]]. 

The method consists of first rewriting the equations as a system of differential equations that are first-order in time, by introducing additional variables. The original and the new variables form a vector in the [[phase space]]. The solution then becomes a [[curve]] in the phase space, parametrized by time. The curve is usually called a [[trajectory]] or an [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]. The differential equation is reformulated as a geometrical description of the curve, that is, as a differential equation in terms of the phase space variables only, without the original time parametrization. Finally, a solution in the phase space is transformed back into the original setting.

The phase space method is used widely in [[physics]]. It can be applied, for example, to find [[traveling wave]] solutions of [[reaction-diffusion system]]s.&lt;ref name="Kolmogorov-1937-SDE"&gt; A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3633">In algebra, '''plethysm''' is an operation on [[ring of symmetric functions|symmetric functions]] introduced by [[Dudley E. Littlewood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|txt|last=Littlewood|year1=1936|loc1=p. 52|year2=1944|loc2=p. 329|author-link=Dudley Ernest Littlewood}}&lt;/ref&gt; who denoted it by {''λ''}&amp;nbsp;⊗&amp;nbsp;{''μ''}. The word "plethysm" for this operation (after the Greek word πληθυσμός meaning "multiplication") was introduced later by {{harvs|txt|last=Littlewood|year1=1950|loc1=p. 289|year2=1950b|loc2=p.274}}, who said that the name was suggested by M. L. Clark.

If symmetric functions are identified with operations in [[lambda ring]]s, then plethysm corresponds to composition of operations.

==In representation theory==
Let ''V'' be a [[vector space]] over [[complex number]]s, considered as a [[group representation|representation]] of GL(''V''). Each [[Young diagram]] λ corresponds to a [[Schur functor]] L&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;(-) on the category of GL(''V'')-representations. Given two Young diagrams λ and μ, consider the decomposition of L&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'')) into a [[direct sum]] of [[irreducible representation]]s of the group. By the [[representation theory]] of the [[general linear group]] we know that each summand is isomorphic to L&lt;sub&gt;ν&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'') for a Young diagram ν. So for some nonnegative multiplicities ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ, μ, ν&lt;/sub&gt; there is an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;L_\lambda(L_\mu(V)) = \bigoplus_{\nu} L_\nu(V)^{\oplus a_{\lambda, \mu, \nu}}&lt;/math&gt;
The '''problem of (outer) plethysm''' is to find an expression for the multiplicities ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ, μ, ν&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="weyman"&gt;{{cite book| first=Jerzy | last=Weyman | title = Cohomology of Vector Bundles and Syzygies | year = 2003 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 9780511546556 | doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511546556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This formulation is closely related to the classical question. The [[Character theory|character]] of the GL(''V'')-representation L&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'') is a symmetric function in dim(''V'') variables, known as the [[Schur polynomial]] ''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to the Young diagram λ. Schur polynomials form a basis in the space of symmetric functions. Hence to understand the plethysm of two symmetric functions it would be enough to know their expressions in that basis and an expression for a plethysm of two arbitrary Schur polynomials {''s''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}⊗{''s''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;} . The second piece of data is precisely the character of L&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;(L&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'')).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6083">'''Psychologism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] position, according to which [[psychology]] plays a central role in grounding or explaining some other, non-psychological type of fact or law.

==Overview==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines ''psychologism'' as: "The view or doctrine that a theory of psychology or ideas forms the basis of an account of metaphysics, epistemology, or meaning; (sometimes) spec. the explanation or derivation of mathematical or logical laws in terms of psychological facts."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologism in [[epistemology]], the idea that its problems "can be solved satisfactorily by the psychological study of the development of mental processes", was argued in [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1690).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Psychologism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of psychologism are logical psychologism and mathematical psychologism. Logical psychologism is a position in [[logic]] (or the philosophy of logic) according to which [[Classical logic|logical laws]] and [[mathematics|mathematical]] laws are grounded in, derived from, explained or exhausted by psychological facts or laws. Psychologism in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] is the position that mathematical concepts and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts or laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shaun Gallagher|Gallagher, S.]], ''Phenomenology'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=c7sYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 20].&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was coined by [[Johann Eduard Erdmann]] as ''Psychologismus'', being translated into English as ''psychologism''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/ Psychologism]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Kusch|Kusch, M.]], ''Psychologism: The Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge'' (London &amp; New York: [[Routledge]], 1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=JJuIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 101].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]] was accused by [[Edmund Husserl]] of being an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, although this may not have been the case.&lt;ref&gt;Skorupski, JM., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ghesAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=psychologism+mill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWNsVPvSHNf3aorHgdgD&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=psychologism%20mill&amp;f=false ''Mill (Arguments of the Philosophers)''], Routledge, 2010, pp. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; So were many nineteenth-century German philosophers such as [[Christoph von Sigwart]], [[Benno Erdmann]],  [[Theodor Lipps]], [[Gerardus Heymans]], [[Wilhelm Jerusalem]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Elsenhans|de}},&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/#ExaPsyRea Psychologism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy): "Examples of Psychologistic Reasoning"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a number of psychologists, past and present (e.g., [[Wilhelm Wundt]]&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; and [[Gustave Le Bon]]&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Szacki, ''History of Sociological Thought'', Greenwood Press, 1979, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Psychologism was notably criticized by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his [[anti-psychologistic]] work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl's ''[[Philosophy of Arithmetic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Haddock, G. E. R., ''A Critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Gottlob Frege'' ([[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]: [[Routledge]], 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wsi1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;redir_esc=y&amp;hl=pl#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 110].&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl, in the first volume of his ''[[Logical Investigations (Husserl)|Logical Investigations]]'', called "The Prolegomena of Pure Logic", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. Frege's arguments were largely ignored, while Husserl's were widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kusch |first=Martin |authorlink= |date=November 7, 2011 |coauthors= |title=Psychologism |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/psychologism/ |doi= |id= |accessdate=Nov 19, 2014 |ref=harvnb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Psychologism and Behaviorism", [[Ned Block]] takes psychologism as the position that "whether behavior is intelligent behavior depends on the character of the internal information processing that produces it." This is in contrast to a behavioral view which would state that intelligence can be ascribed to a being solely via observing its behavior. This latter type of behavioral view is strongly associated with the [[Turing test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13028">'''Ralph Henstock''' (2 June 1923 &amp;ndash; 17 January 2007) was an [[England|English]] [[mathematician]] and author. As an [[Integral#Other integrals|Integration theorist]], he is notable for [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]]. Henstock brought the theory to a highly developed stage without ever having encountered [[Jaroslav Kurzweil]]'s 1957 paper on the subject.

==Early life==
He was born in the coal-mining village of [[Newstead, Nottinghamshire]], the only child of mineworker and former coalminer William Henstock and Mary Ellen Henstock (née Bancroft). On the Henstock side he was descended from 17th century  [[Flemish people|Flemish]] immigrants called Hemstok.

Because of his early academic promise it was expected that Henstock would attend the [[University of Nottingham]] where his father and uncle had received technical education, but as it turned out he won scholarships which enabled him to study mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] from October 1941 until November 1943, when he was sent for war service to the [[Ministry of Supply]]’s department of Statistical Method and Quality Control in London. 

This work did not satisfy him, so he enrolled at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[London]] where he joined the weekly seminar of Professor [[Paul Dienes]] which was then a focus for mathematical activity in London. Henstock wanted to study [[divergent series]] but Dienes prevailed upon him to get involved in the theory of [[Integral|integration]], thereby setting him on course for his life’s work.

A devoted [[Methodist]], the lasting impression he made was one of gentle sincerity and amiability. Henstock married Marjorie Jardine in 1949. Their son John was born 10 July 1952. Ralph Henstock died on 17 January 2007 after a short illness.

==Work==
He was awarded the [[University of Cambridge#Mathematics|Cambridge B.A.]] in 1944 and began research for the [[PhD#United Kingdom|PhD]] in Birkbeck College, London, under the supervision of Paul Dienes. His PhD thesis, entitled ''[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08486.pdf Interval Functions and their Integrals]'', was submitted in December 1948. His Ph.D. examiners were Burkill and H. Kestelman. In 1947 he returned briefly to Cambridge to complete the undergraduate mathematical studies which had been truncated by his Ministry of Supply work.

Most of Henstock's work was concerned with integration. From initial studies of the Burkill and [[John Clive Ward|Ward]] integrals he formulated an integration process whereby the domain of integration is suitably partitioned for [[Riemann sum]]s to approximate the integral of a function. His methods led to an integral on the real line that was very similar in construction and simplicity to the [[Riemann integral]] but which included the [[Lebesgue integral]] and, in addition, allowed non-absolute convergence.

These ideas were developed from the late 1950s. Independently, Jaroslav Kurzweil developed a similar Riemann-type integral on the real line. The resulting integral is now known as the [[Henstock-Kurzweil integral]]. On the real line it is equivalent to the [[Denjoy-Perron integral]], but has a simpler definition.

In the following decades, Henstock developed extensively the distinctive features of his theory, inventing the concepts of division spaces or integration bases to demonstrate in general settings the properties and characteristics of mathematical integration. His theory provides a unified approach to non-absolute integral, as different kinds of Henstock integral, choosing an appropriate integration basis (division space, in Henstock's own terminology). It has been used in differential and integral equations, harmonic analysis, probability theory and [[Functional integration#The Feynman integral|Feynman integration]]. Numerous monographs and texts have appeared since 1980 and there have been several conferences devoted to the theory. It has been taught in standard courses in mathematical analysis.

Henstock was author of 46 journal papers in the period 1946 to 2006. He published four books on analysis (Theory of Integration, 1963; Linear Analysis, 1967; Lectures on the Theory of Integration, 1988; and The General Theory of Integration, 1991). He wrote 171 reviews for [[MathSciNet]]. In 1994 he was awarded the Andy Prize of the XVIII Summer [[Academic conference|Symposium]] in Real Analysis. His academic career began as Assistant Lecturer, [[Bedford College for Women]], 1947–48; then Assistant Lecturer at Birkbeck, 1948–51; Lecturer, [[Queen's University Belfast]], 1951–56; Lecturer, [[Bristol University]], 1956–60; Senior Lecturer and Reader, Queen’s University Belfast, 1960–64; Reader, [[Lancaster University]], 1964–70; Chair of Pure Mathematics, [[New University of Ulster]], 1970–88; and Leverhulme Fellow 1988-91.

=== List of publications of Ralph Henstock ===
Much of Henstock's earliest work was published by the [[List of scientific journals in mathematics|Journal of the London Mathematical Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2596">In [[recursion theory|computability theory]], the '''Rice–Shapiro theorem''' is a generalization of [[Rice's theorem]], and is named after [[Henry Gordon Rice]] and [[Norman Shapiro]].&lt;ref name=rogers_1987&gt;{{ cite book | title=Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability | author=Rogers Jr., Hartley  | publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-68052-1 | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal statement==
Let ''A'' be a set of partial-recursive unary [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] on the domain of [[natural numbers]] such that the set &lt;math&gt;Ix(A):=\{ n \mid \varphi_n \in A \}&lt;/math&gt; is [[recursively enumerable]], where &lt;math&gt;\varphi_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th partial-recursive function in a [[Gödel number]]ing.

Then for any unary partial-recursive function ''&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;'', we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi \in A \Leftrightarrow \exists&lt;/math&gt; a finite function  &lt;math&gt;\theta \subseteq \psi&lt;/math&gt; such that  &lt;math&gt;\theta \in A.&lt;/math&gt;

In the given statement, a finite function is a function with a finite domain &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,...,x_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta \subseteq \psi&lt;/math&gt; means that for every &lt;math&gt;x \in \{x_1,x_2,...,x_m\}&lt;/math&gt; it holds that &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined and equal to &lt;math&gt;\theta(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Perspective from Effective Topology==
For any finite unary function &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on integers,
let &lt;math&gt;C(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; denote the 'frustum'
of all partial-recursive functions that are defined, and agree with &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;,
on &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;'s domain.

Equip the set of all partial-recursive functions with the topology generated by these
frusta as [[Base_(topology)|base]]. Note that for every frustum &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Ix(C)&lt;/math&gt; is 
recursively enumerable. More generally it holds for every set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
of partial-recursive functions:

&lt;math&gt;Ix(A)&lt;/math&gt; is recursively enumerable   iff 
&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a recursively enumerable union of frusta.

The Rosetta [[system]]-level [[specification language]] is a design language for complex, [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous systems]].  Specific language design objectives include:
* [[Constraint programming|Constraint]] representation
* Heterogeneous system representation and specification [[composability]]
* Well-defined [[Semantics (computer science)|formal semantics]] and support for formal analysis
* [[Scalability]] to large designs
Rosetta was undergoing [[standardization]] at various times.

== History ==
The Rosetta effort emerged from a meeting in of the Semiconductor Industry Council's System-Level Design Language committee in 1996.  The objective of the meeting was to define requirements for a next-generation design language that would address perceived shortcomings in existing languages such as [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]].  Specific concerns included inability to represent constraints, lack of a formal semantics, inability to represent heterogeneous systems, and heavy reliance on [[computer simulation]] for analysis.  In response to these requirements, three major approaches were pursued:
# Extending [[hardware description language]]s including [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]]
# Extending [[programming language]]s including [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]
# Defining new languages

The first approach ultimately resulted in [[SystemVerilog]] and extensions to VHDL while the second resulted in [[SystemC]], all of which became [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) standards for the [[semiconductor industry]].
Rosetta's original application domain was [[system on a chip]] semiconductor systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Rosetta provides support for system-level design |authors= Perry Alexander and David Barton |work= EE Times |date= June 2000 |url= http://www.eet.com/special/special_issues/2000/techtrends/rosetta.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20000816011143/http://www.eet.com/special/special_issues/2000/techtrends/rosetta.html |archivedate= August 16, 2000 |accessdate= October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosetta resulted from the third approach with development beginning under the auspices of the Semiconductor Industry Council and the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]].  Originally developed by Perry Alexander and others at the [[University of Kansas]], it was known simply as System-Level Design Language.&lt;ref name="sldl"&gt;{{Cite web |title= About SLDL and Rosetta |work= Original web site |publisher= University of Kansas |url= http://www.ittc.ukans.edu/Projects/rosetta/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040318224600/http://www.sldl.org/ |archivedate=March 18, 2004 |accessdate= October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Standardization was transferred to VHDL International by 2000 and renamed Rosetta (after the [[Rosetta Stone]]) to reflect the heterogeneous nature of its specifications.  Eventually, VHDL International and the Open Verilog Initiative merged to form [[Accellera]], an industry sponsored [[consortium]] for [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) standards.  
A draft standard of Rosetta was published in November 2003 through Accellera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Rosetta Design Language On Road To Standardization |date= November 10, 2003 |work= Electronic Design |author= David Maliniak |url= http://electronicdesign.com/boards/rosetta-design-language-road-standardization |accessdate= October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Standardization was transferred to IEEE [[Design Automation Standards Committee]] (DASC) where it was developed by the Rosetta Working Group under IEEE project P1699 starting in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rosetta WG - Rosetta Systems Level Design Language Working Group |url= http://standards.ieee.org/develop/wg/Rosetta_WG.html |publisher=IEEE Standards Association |accessdate= October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= P1699 - Standard for the Rosetta Systems Level Design Language Definition |publisher= IEEE Standards Association |work= Project approval letter |author= Sherry Hampton |date= March 22, 2007 |url= http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/nescom/projects/1699.pdf |accessdate= October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A draft of a language reference manual was published in April 2008, with editor Peter Ashenden of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= P1699 Rosetta LRM subcommittee |date= April 22, 2008 |url= http://www.ashenden.com.au/rosetta-std/ |accessdate= October 7, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150610214353/http://www.ashenden.com.au/rosetta-std/ |archivedate= June 10, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The project was withdrawn in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Standards Board New Standards Committee (NesCom) Recommendations |publisher= IEEE Standards Association |date= June 14, 2013 |url= http://standards.ieee.org/about/sasb/nescom/13-Jun-2013_NesRec.pdf |accessdate= October 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Rosetta is structured around three sub-languages that support defining various specification elements.  The ''[[Expression (computer science)|expression]] language'' defines basic functions and expressions used as terms and values in specifications.  The expression language is a [[Strict programming language|non-strict]], [[purely functional language|purely functional]], [[Type system|typed]] language in the spirit of [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].  Functions are [[Referential transparency (computer science)|referentially transparent]], encapsulated expressions and cannot have side effects.  All Rosetta expressions have types that are determined statically.  The type system is based on lifted sets where each type contains at least the bottom or undefined value.  Any set can be used to define a type and any function that returns a set can be used to define a type former.  Because type definitions can contain general Rosetta expressions, the type system is [[Dependent types|dependent]].

The ''facet language'' defines individual specifications and specification composition to define systems. ''Facets'' and ''components'' define system models from one engineering perspective. Each facet is written by extending a ''domain'' that provides vocabulary and semantics for the model. Facets are defined by declaring items and defining properties for those items.  As such, Rosetta is a [[Declarative programming|declarative language]] and constructs cannot be guaranteed to evaluate to a value, although some facets can be evaluated.  Using the design abstractions provided by its domain, a facet describes requirements, behavior, constraints, or function of a system.  Facets are heterogeneous and may be defined using any of the predefined or user defined domains.  The Rosetta semantics denotes each facet to a [[coalgebra]] that defines its model-of-computation.  Because Rosetta is [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflective]], facets can be composed and transformed to define complex systems.  A common specification technique is to write facets for different aspects of a system and then compose those aspects using product and sum operations to define the complete system.

The ''domain language'' defines specification domains otherwise known as specification types.  The collection of domains forms a [[complete lattice]] ordered by [[homomorphism]] with the empty or ''null'' domain as its top element and the inconsistent or ''bottom'' domain as its bottom.  There are three primary domain types.  Units-of-semantics domains define basic units of specification.  For example, the '''state_based''' domain defines the concept of state and next state without constraining the values or properties.  Model-of-computation domains extend unit-of-semantics domains to define general computational models such as '''finite_state''', '''continuous_time''', '''discrete_time''' and '''frequency'''.  Engineering domains extend model-of-computation domains to provide specification capabilities for specific engineering domains.

Since its early days, Rosetta expanded to include design domains such as hydraulic and  mechanical systems, networking systems, security and trust, and software defined radios.

==Further reading==
Rosetta was influenced heavily by the non-strict, purely functional language [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], the [[Larch Shared Language|Larch]] family of specification languages, and [[Prototype Verification System]] (PVS). A book devoted to the language was published in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Perry Alexander |title= System Level Design with Rosetta |year= 2006|publisher= Morgan Kaufmann |isbn= 978-1-55860-771-2 |url=http://www.elsevier.com/books/system-level-design-with-rosetta/alexander/978-1-55860-771-2#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sine and Cosine.svg|thumb|400px|right|The graphs of the sine and [[Trigonometric functions#cosine|cosine]] functions are sinusoids of different phases.]]
A '''sine wave''' or '''sinusoid''' is a [[curve|mathematical curve]] that describes a smooth periodic [[oscillation]]. A sine wave is a [[continuous wave]].  It is named after the function [[sine]], of which it is the [[graph of a function|graph]]. It occurs often in pure and applied [[mathematics]], as well as [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[signal processing]] and many other fields. Its most basic form as a function of time (''t'') is''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;y(t) = A\sin(2 \pi f t + \varphi) = A\sin(\omega t + \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* ''A'' = the ''[[amplitude]]'', the peak deviation of the function from zero.
* ''f'' = the ''[[frequency|ordinary frequency]]'', the ''[[Real number|number]]'' of oscillations (cycles) that occur each second of time.
* ''ω'' = 2π''f'', the ''[[angular frequency]]'', the rate of change of the function argument in units of [[radians per second]] 
* ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' = the ''[[Phase (waves)|phase]]'', specifies (in [[radians]]) where in its cycle the oscillation is at ''t'' = 0.
** When ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'' is non-zero, the entire waveform appears to be shifted in time by the amount ''&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''/''ω'' seconds.  A negative value represents a delay, and a positive value represents an advance.

{{Listen|filename=220 Hz sine wave.ogg|title=Sine wave|description=2 seconds of a 220 Hz sine wave}}
[[Image:Animated-mass-spring.gif|right|frame|The oscillation of an undamped spring-mass system around the equilibrium is a sine wave]]
The sine wave is important in physics because it retains its wave shape when added to another sine wave of the same frequency and arbitrary phase and magnitude. It is the only periodic waveform that has this property. This property leads to its importance in [[Fourier analysis]] and makes it acoustically unique.

== General form ==
In general, the function may also have''':'''

* a spatial variable ''x'' that represents the ''position'' on the dimension on which the wave propagates, and a characteristic parameter ''k'' called [[wave number]] (or angular wave number), which represents the proportionality between the angular frequency &amp;omega; and the linear speed ([[phase velocity|speed of propagation]]) &amp;nu; 
* a non-zero center amplitude, ''D''

which is

:&lt;math&gt;y(x,t) = A\sin(kx -\omega t + \varphi ) + D\,&lt;/math&gt;, if the wave is moving to the right
:&lt;math&gt;y(x,t) = A\sin(kx + \omega t + \varphi ) + D\,&lt;/math&gt;, if the wave is moving to the left.

The wavenumber is related to the angular frequency by''':'''.

:&lt;math&gt; k = { \omega \over v } = { 2 \pi f \over v } = { 2 \pi \over \lambda }&lt;/math&gt;

where λ (Lambda) is the [[wavelength]], ''f'' is the [[frequency]], and ''v'' is the linear speed.

This equation gives a sine wave for a single dimension; thus the generalized equation given above gives the displacement of the wave at a position ''x'' at time ''t'' along a single line.
This could, for example, be considered the value of a wave along a wire.

In two or three spatial dimensions, the same equation describes a travelling [[plane wave]] if position ''x'' and wavenumber ''k'' are interpreted as vectors, and their product as a [[dot product]]. 
For more complex waves such as the height of a water wave in a pond after a stone has been dropped in, more complex equations are needed.

== Occurrences ==
[[File:ComplexSinInATimeAxe.gif|thumb|400px|Illustrating the cosine wave's fundamental relationship to the circle.]]
This [[wave]] pattern occurs often in nature, including [[wind wave]]s, [[sound]] waves, and [[light]] waves.

A [[cosine]] wave is said to be "sinusoidal", because &lt;math&gt;\cos(x) = \sin(x + \pi/2),&lt;/math&gt;
which is also a sine wave with a phase-shift of π/2 radians. Because of this "[[head start (positioning)|head start]]", it is often said that the cosine function ''leads'' the sine function or the sine ''lags'' the cosine.

The human [[ear]] can recognize single sine waves as sounding clear because sine waves are representations of a single [[frequency]] with no [[harmonics]].

To the human ear, a sound that is made of more than one sine wave will have perceptible [[harmonics]]; addition of different sine waves results in a different waveform and thus changes the [[timbre]] of the sound. Presence of higher harmonics in addition to the fundamental causes variation in the timbre, which is the reason why the same [[musical note]] (the same frequency) played on different instruments sounds different. On the other hand, if the sound contains aperiodic waves along with sine waves (which are periodic), then the sound will be perceived "noisy" as [[Noise (acoustic)|noise]] is characterized as being aperiodic or having a non-repetitive pattern.

== Fourier series ==
[[File:Waveforms.svg|thumb|400px|Sine, [[square wave|square]], [[triangle wave|triangle]], and [[sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] waveforms]]

{{main|Fourier analysis}}

In 1822, French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] discovered that sinusoidal waves can be used as simple building blocks to describe and approximate any periodic waveform, including [[square wave]]s. Fourier used it as an analytical tool in the study of waves and heat flow. It is frequently used in [[signal processing]] and the statistical analysis of [[time series]].

==Traveling and standing waves==
Since sine waves propagate without changing form in distributed linear systems, they are often used to analyze [[wave]] propagation.  Sine waves traveling in two directions in space can be represented as

:&lt;math&gt;u(t,x) = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

When two waves having the same amplitude and frequency, and traveling in opposite directions, [[Superposition principle|superpose]] each other, then a [[standing wave]] pattern is created. Note that, on a plucked string, the interfering waves are the waves reflected from the fixed end points of the string. Therefore, standing waves occur only at certain frequencies, which are referred to as resonant frequencies and are composed of a fundamental frequency and its higher harmonics. The resonant frequencies of a string are determined by the length between the fixed ends and the [[Tension (physics)|tension]] of the string.

In [[mathematics]], the '''spherical mean''' of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] around a point is the average of all values of that function on a sphere of given radius centered at that point.

==Definition==
Consider an [[open set]] ''U'' in the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and a [[continuous function]] ''u'' defined on ''U'' with [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] values. Let ''x'' be a point in ''U'' and ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 be such that the [[closed set|closed]] [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] ''B''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''r'') of center ''x'' and radius ''r'' is contained in ''U''.  The '''spherical mean''' over the sphere of radius ''r'' centered at ''x'' is defined as

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega_{n-1}(r)}\int\limits_{\partial B(x, r)} \! u(y) \, \mathrm{d} S(y) &lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;part;''B''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''r'') is the [[n-sphere|(''n''&amp;minus;1)-sphere]] forming the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''B''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''r''), d''S'' denotes integration with respect to [[spherical measure]] and ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') is the "surface area" of this (''n''&amp;minus;1)-sphere.

Equivalently, the spherical mean is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega_{n-1}}\int\limits_{\|y\|=1} \! u(x+ry) \, \mathrm{d}S(y) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the area of the (''n''&amp;minus;1)-sphere of radius 1.

The spherical mean is often denoted as

: &lt;math&gt;\int\limits_{\partial B(x, r)}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!-\,  u(y) \, \mathrm{d} S(y). &lt;/math&gt;

The spherical mean is also defined for Riemannian manifolds in a natural manner.

==Properties and uses==

* From the continuity of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; it follows that the function

::&lt;math&gt;r\to \int\limits_{\partial B(x, r)}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!-\,  u(y) \,\mathrm{d}S(y)&lt;/math&gt;

:is continuous, and its [[Limit of a function|limit]] as &lt;math&gt;r\to 0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;u(x).&lt;/math&gt;

* Spherical means are used in finding the solution of the [[wave equation]] &lt;math&gt;u_{tt}=c^2\Delta u&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; with prescribed [[boundary conditions]] at &lt;math&gt;t=0.&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is an open set in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is  a [[smooth function|''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] function defined on &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is [[harmonic function|harmonic]] if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that the closed ball &lt;math&gt;B(x, r)&lt;/math&gt; is contained in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; one has

::&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\int\limits_{\partial B(x, r)}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!-\,  u(y) \,\mathrm{d}S(y).&lt;/math&gt;

: This result can be used to prove the [[maximum principle]] for harmonic functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1444">In mathematics, Weinstein's '''symplectic category''' is (roughly) a [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are [[symplectic manifold]]s and whose morphisms are '''canonical relations''', inclusions of [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s ''L'' into &lt;math&gt;M \times N^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, where the superscript minus means minus the given symplectic form (for example, the graph of a [[symplectomorphism]]; hence, minus). The notion was introduced by [[Alan Weinstein]], according to whom "Quantization problems&lt;ref&gt;He means [[geometric quantization]].&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the category of symplectic manifolds and symplectomorphisms be augmented by the inclusion of canonical relations as morphisms." The composition of canonical relations is given by a [[fiber product]].

Strictly speaking, the symplectic category is not a well-defined category (since the composition may not be well-defined) without some transversality conditions.

'''T-Square''' is an early [[technical drawing|drafting]] program written by [[Peter Samson]] assisted by [[Alan Kotok]] and possibly [[Robert Alan Saunders|Robert A. Saunders]] while they were students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and members of the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]].

T-Square was written for the [[PDP-1]] computer and its Type 30 precision [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] that [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] donated to MIT in 1961. It is unlikely that many people have had the opportunity to use T-Square although Samson has said the group drew some [[schematics]].

==Authors==
Students of [[Jack Dennis]] and [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] discovered a stunning array of uses for the very expensive room-sized computers that were given to MIT. They were privileged to be enrolled when the school's first [[Computer programming|programming]] courses were taught.

They negotiated with their advisors and the operations manager John McKenzie for time and became [[single-user]]s long before [[personal computer]]s were available. About 1959 or 1960, some of this group of students became support staff and wrote software for about $1.75 USD per hour.&lt;ref name=westegg&gt;{{cite web

During this period Samson created other "firsts" in application software for [[Harmony Compiler|music]], [[Expensive Planetarium|games]] and [[TJ-2|page layout]] so it is perhaps not surprising he wrote what may be the first drafting program. Based on this experience, later in life Samson worked on an electronic drafting program with 80,000 lines of code. He received a patent&lt;ref name=VR&gt;{{cite web

To move the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]], T-Square used a [[Spacewar!]] [[game controller]] built by Kotok and Saunders in 1962. It is not known if Saunders was involved in repurposing it for T-Square. Kotok, who was about 20 years old, did participate. He was known for doing what needed to be done and for taking an interest in "all things ingenious or intriguing."&lt;ref name=TBL&gt;{{cite web

The Spacewar! [http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/spacewar4.jpg control boxes] were cobbled together with wood, [[Bakelite]] and [[toggle switch]]es. Although they are often considered to be the first [[joystick]]s, Kotok did not accept credit for coinventing them with Saunders.

T-Square is a small part of the reason people use today's computers for drafting, architecture, drawing and illustration and engineering. Prior to this revolution and in some places to this day, draftsmen and women used [[set square|triangles]], wood or metal [[T-square]]s, [[pencils]] and [[technical pen]]s on [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|film]] and [[paper]].

[[File:Stellation diagram of icosahedron.svg|300px|thumb|The [[stellation diagram]] for the icosahedron with the central triangle marked for the original icosahedron]]
'''''The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra''''' is a book written and illustrated by [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], [[Patrick du Val|P. Du Val]], H. T. Flather and J. F. Petrie. It enumerates certain [[stellation]]s of the regular convex or Platonic [[regular icosahedron|icosahedron]], according to a set of rules put forward by [[J. C. P. Miller]].

First published by the University of Toronto in 1938, a Second Edition reprint by Springer-Verlag followed in 1982. Tarquin's 1999 Third Edition included new reference material and photographs by K. and D. Crennell.

==Authors' contributions==

===Miller's rules===

Although [[J. C. P. Miller|Miller]] did not contribute to the book directly, he was a close colleague of Coxeter and Petrie. His contribution is immortalised in his set of rules for defining which stellation forms should be considered "properly significant and distinct":&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter, du Val, et al (Third Edition 1999) Pages 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''(i) The faces must lie in twenty planes, viz., the bounding planes of the regular icosahedron.''

:''(ii) All parts composing the faces must be the same in each plane, although they may be quite disconnected.''

:''(iii) The parts included in any one plane must have trigonal symmetry, without or with reflection. This secures icosahedral symmetry for the whole solid.''

:''(iv) The parts included in any plane must all be "accessible" in the completed solid (i.e. they must be on the "outside". In certain cases we should require models of enormous size in order to see all the outside. With a model of ordinary size, some parts of the "outside" could only be explored by a crawling insect).''

:''(v) We exclude from consideration cases where the parts can be divided into two sets, each giving a solid with as much symmetry as the whole figure. But we allow the combination of an enantiomorphous pair having no common part (which actually occurs in just one case).''

Rules (i) to (iii) are symmetry requirements for the face planes. Rule (iv) excludes buried holes, to ensure that no two stellations look outwardly identical. Rule (v) prevents any disconnected compound of simpler stellations.

===Coxeter===
Coxeter was the main driving force behind the work. He carried out the original analysis based on Miller's rules, adopting a number of techniques such as [[combinatorics]] and abstract [[graph theory]] whose use in a geometrical context was then novel.

He observed that the stellation diagram comprised many line segments. He then developed procedures for manipulating combinations of the adjacent plane regions, to formally enumerate the combinations allowed under Miller's rules.

[[File:icosagraph.svg|right]]
His graph, reproduced here, shows the connectivity of the various faces identified in the stellation diagram (see below). The Greek symbols represent sets of possible alternatives:
: λ may be 3 or 4
: μ may be 7 or 8
: ν may be 11 or 12

===Du Val===
Du Val devised a symbolic notation for identifying sets of congruent cells, based on the observation that they lie in "shells" around the original icosahedron. Based on this he tested all possible combinations against Miller's rules, confirming the result of Coxeter's more analytical approach.

===Flather===
Flather's contribution was indirect: he made card models of all 59. When he first met Coxeter he had already made many stellations, including some "non-Miller" examples. He went on to complete the series of fifty-nine, which are preserved in the mathematics library of Cambridge University, England. The library also holds some non-Miller models, but it is not known whether these were made by Flather or by Miller's later students.&lt;ref&gt;Inchbald, G.; ''Some lost stellations of the icosahedron'', steelpillow.com, 11 July 2006. [http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/icosa/lost/lost.html] (retrieved 14 September 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrie===
John Flinders Petrie was a lifelong friend of Coxeter and had a remarkable ability to visualise four-dimensional geometry. He and Coxeter had worked together on many mathematical problems. His direct contribution to the fifty nine icosahedra was the exquisite set of three-dimensional drawings which provide much of the fascination of the published work.

===The Crennells===
For the Third Edition, Kate and David Crennell reset the text and redrew the diagrams. They also added a reference section containing tables, diagrams, and photographs of some of the Cambridge models (which at that time were all thought to be Flather's). Corrections to this edition have been published online.&lt;ref&gt;K. and D. Crennell; ''The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra'', Fortran Friends, [http://fortran.orpheusweb.co.uk/Poly/59icos.htm] (retrieved 14 September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of the fifty nine icosahedra==

[[File:Icosahedron stellation diagram center.svg|thumb|right|300px|Stellation diagram with numbered cells]]
[[File:Icosahedron cell diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Cell diagram with Du Val notation for cells]]

Before Coxeter, only [[Max Brückner|Brückner]] and [[A. Harry Wheeler|Wheeler]] had recorded any significant sets of stellations, although a few such as the great icosahedron had been known for longer. Since publication of ''The 59'', Wenninger published instructions on making models of some; the numbering scheme used in his book has become widely referenced, although he only recorded a few stellations.

===Notes on the list===
Index numbers are the Crennells' unless otherwise stated:

'''Crennell'''
*In the index numbering added to the Third Edition by the Crennells, the first 32 forms (indices 1-32) are [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflective]] models, and the last 27 (indices 33-59) are [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] with only the right-handed forms listed. This follows the order in which the stellations are depicted in the book.

'''Cells'''
*In Du Val's notation, each shell is identified in bold type, working outwards, as '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ..., '''h''' with '''a''' being the original icosahedron. Some shells subdivide into two types of cell, for example '''e''' comprises '''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' and  '''e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''. The set '''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' further subdivides into right- and left-handed forms, respectively f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (plain type) and ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' (italic). Where a stellation has all cells present within an outer shell, the outer shell is capitalised and the inner omitted, for example '''a''' + '''b''' + '''c''' + '''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is written as '''Ce&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

'''Faces'''
*All of the stellations can be specified by a [[stellation diagram]]. In the diagram shown here, the numbered colors indicate the regions of the stellation diagram which must occur together as a set, if full icosahedral symmetry is to be maintained. The diagram has 13 such sets. Some of these subdivide into chiral pairs (not shown), allowing stellations with rotational but not reflexive symmetry. In the table, faces which are seen from underneath are indicated by an apostrophe, for example '''3{{'}}'''.

'''Wenninger'''
*The index numbers and the numbered names were allocated arbitrarily by Wenninger's publisher according to their occurrence in his book ''Polyhedron models'' and bear no relation to any mathematical sequence. Only a few of his models were of icosahedra. His names are given in shortened form, with "... of the icosahedron" left off.

'''Wheeler'''
*Wheeler found his figures, or "forms" of the icosahedron, by selecting line segments from the stellation diagram. He carefully distinguished this from [[Kepler]]'s classical [[stellation]] process. Coxeter et al. ignored this distinction and referred to all of them as stellations.

'''Brückner'''
*[[Max Brückner]] made and photographed models of many polyhedra, only a few of which were icosahedra. ''Taf.'' is an abbreviation of ''Tafel'', German for ''[[Collotype|plate]]''.

'''Remarks'''
*No. 8 is sometimes called the '''echidnahedron''' after an imagined similarity to the spiny anteater or [[echidna]]. This usage is independent of [[Kepler]]'s description of his [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron|regular star polyhedra]] as his ''echidnae''.

In applied mathematics, '''Wahba's problem''', first posed by [[Grace Wahba]] in 1965, seeks to find a [[rotation matrix]] ([[Orthogonal matrix|special orthogonal matrix]]) between two coordinate systems from a set of (weighted) vector observations. Solutions to Wahba's problem are often used in [[satellite]] [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|attitude determination]] utilising sensors such as [[magnetometer]]s and multi-antenna [[Global Positioning System|GPS receivers]]. The cost function that Wahba's problem seeks to minimise is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;J(\mathbf{R}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{N} a_k\| \mathbf{w}_k - \mathbf{R} \mathbf{v}_k \|^2 &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;N\geq2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''-th 3-vector measurement in the reference frame, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_k&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding ''k''-th 3-vector measurement in the body frame and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a 3 by 3 rotation matrix between the coordinate frames.&lt;ref&gt;The rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; in the problem's definition transforms the body frame to the reference frame. Most publications define rotation in the reverse direction, i.e. from the reference to the body frame which amounts to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^T&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt; is an optional set of weights for each observation.

A number of solutions to the problem have appeared in literature, notably Davenport's q-method, QUEST and [[singular value decomposition]]-based methods.  This is an alternative formulation of the [[Orthogonal Procrustes problem]] (consider all the vectors multiplied by the square-roots of the corresponding weights as columns of two matrices with ''N'' columns to obtain the alternative formulation).

Several methods for solving Wahba's problem are discussed by Markley and Mortari.

== Solution by Singular Value Decomposition ==

One solution can be found using a [[singular value decomposition]] as reported by [http://www.control.auc.dk/~tb/best/aug23-Bak-svdalg.pdf Markley]

1. Obtain a matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \mathbf{w}_i {\mathbf{v}_i}^T&lt;/math&gt;

2. Find the [[singular value decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{S} \mathbf{V}^T&lt;/math&gt;

3. The rotation matrix is simply:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{U} \mathbf{M} \mathbf{V}^T&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M} = \operatorname{diag}(\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 &amp; \det(\mathbf{U}) \det(\mathbf{V})\end{bmatrix})&lt;/math&gt;

'''William Shanks''' (25 January 1812 – June 1882)&lt;ref&gt;GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1882 10a 252 HOUGHTON – William Shanks, aged 70&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] amateur mathematician.

Shanks is famous for his calculation of ''[[pi|π]]'' to 707 places, accomplished in 1873, which, however, was only correct up to the first 527 places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6978433.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Pi a mathematical story that would take 49000 years to tell | first=Chris | last=Smyth | date=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This error was highlighted in 1944 by [[D. F. Ferguson]] (using a mechanical [[desk calculator]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shanks's Biography|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Shanks.html|publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland|accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanks earned his living by owning a [[boarding school]] at [[Houghton-le-Spring]], which left him enough time to spend on his hobby of calculating mathematical constants. His routine was as follows: he would calculate new digits all morning; and then he would spend all afternoon checking his morning's work.  To calculate ''π'', Shanks used [[John Machin|Machin's formula]]:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi}{4} = 4 \arctan \left(\frac{1}{5} \right) - \arctan \left(\frac{1}{239} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Shanks's approximation was the longest expansion of ''π'' until the advent of the electronic digital computer about one century later.

Shanks also calculated ''[[e (number)|e]]'' and the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]] γ to many decimal places. He published a table of [[Prime number|prime]]s up to 60 000 and found the [[natural logarithm]]s of 2, 3, 5 and 10 to 137 places.

Shanks died in Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, England in June 1882, aged 70, and was buried at the local Hillside Cemetery on 17 June 1882.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houghtonlespring.org.uk/records/hillside_records.htm Houghton le Spring Hillside Cemetery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
