The Sony '''9-Pin Protocol''' or P1 protocol is a two-way [[communications protocol]] to control advanced video recorders. Sony introduced this protocol to control  reel-to-reel [[type C videotape|type C]] [[video tape recorder]]s (VTR) as well as [[videocassette recorder]]s (VCR). It uses an [[D-subminiature|DE-9 D-Sub]] connector with 9 pins (hence the name), where bi-directional communication takes place over a four wire cable according to the [[RS-422|RS-422 standard]]. The communication parameters are 38,400 baud, 8 data bits, odd parity and 1 stop bit (38k4/8O1).&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.sgi.com/sgi/video/rld/vidpage/s9pinnt.html Sony 9-Pin Remote Protocol&lt;/ref&gt;

While nowadays all [[post-production]] editing is done with a [[non-linear editing system]], in those days editing was done [[linear editing|linearly]], using  [[online editing]]. Editing machines relied heavily on the 9-Pin Protocol to remotely control automatic players and recorders.

Many modern [[hard disk recorder]]s and [[solid-state drive]] recorders can still emulate a 1982 Sony BVW-75 [[Betacam]] tape recorder.

Sony's standard also specifies a pinout:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:auto;"
! Pin !! on master !! on slave
|-
| 1 || Frame ground || Frame ground
|-
| 2 || Receive A || Transmit A
|-
| 3 || Transmit B || Receive B

|-
| 6 || Receive common || Transmit common
|-
| 7 || Receive B || Transmit B
|-
| 8 || Transmit A || Receive A
|-
| 9 || Frame ground || Frame ground
|-
|}

This 9-pin RS-422 pinout has become a [[de facto]] standard, used by most brands in the broadcast industry. In the new millennium, RS-422 is slowly phased out in favor of [[Ethernet]] for control functions. However its simple way to perform [[troubleshooting]] means it will stay around for a long time.

In [[broadcast automation]] the [[Video Disk Control Protocol]] (VDCP) use the 9-Pin Protocol to [[playout]] [[broadcast programming]] schedules.

'''Anupadaka''', '''anupapadaka''', '''aupapaduka''' ([[Skt.]], 'parentless; self-existing,') is a philosophical term about reality such as the 'anupadaka plane'&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], ''A Textbook of Theosophy'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; or gods or [[Dhyani]]-[[Buddhas]] that fit the definition.  Actually beyond anupadaka is '[[adi (metaphysical plane)|adi]]' (Skt., 'first,') having to do with the [[first cause]], itself from [[causeless cause]].

Hence, it does not matter if scientists think there are no gods or Dhyani-Buddhas: anupadaka is still an idea about something that is an effect of the first cause or [[causality]].  In that sense it may have to do with a scientific idea or the term can be applied to one: the term came to the West from [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], which focuses on science as much as religion, and 'anupadaka' may have distinct meanings in Theosophy.

'''Balance of contract''' is a term used in the [[Retailing|retail]] industry.   [[Retailing|Retailers]] contract with their [[Supply chain|suppliers]] to supply a quantity of product in a specified time period to a specific location at an agreed price.   The [[Retailing|retailer]] "calls off" the production of the product to match the expected or actual sales curves, depending on the stage in the life-cycle of the product.   At any one point in the [[Product life cycle management|life-cycle of the product]], the "balance of contract" is the undelivered portion of the contract to which the [[Retailing|retailer]] is [[commitment control|committed]] in the future.

A "Balanced Contract" between two parties should have equal stakes and liabilities for both, through all stages of execution of the contract. An unbalanced contract, providing greater options to one party and restricting options of the other party, may be set aside in the court of law.

The process of '''breaking down the script''' occurs after the [[film producer|producer]] reads through the [[screenplay]] once. The producer or a first assistant director reviews the script, and marks certain elements that need to be taken care of before [[film production|production]], or even before [[pre-production]] can begin.

==Marking 1/8s==
Each scene, as per [[Screenplay slug line|slug line]], is measured into 1/8s of a page by its number of inches. Most pages of a screenplay are eight inches, so each inch is an 1/8, even if a page exceeds eight inches. The number of 1/8s is then marked in the top left corner of the scene, and circled. If a scene lasts longer than eight 1/8s, it is converted to 1. So, a scene lasting twelve 1/8s is marked 1 4/8.

==Marking elements==
To ease future production, an assistant director marks the elements found in each scene. This process repeats for each new scene. By the end, the producer will be able to see which scenes need which elements, and can begin to schedule accordingly. The film industry has a standard for color-coding:

===Element color codes===

A '''comeback''' (or '''come-from-behind''') is an occurrence of an athlete or sports team engaged in a competition overcoming a substantial disadvantage in points or position, particularly if this results in the disadvantaged team winning. It has been described as "the single greatest aspect of competition that most embodies the spirit of what makes sport extraordinary".&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/08/20/5-epic-sports-comebacks/|title=Top 5 Epic Sports Comebacks|work=cbslocal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been observed in [[spectator sport]]s that "dramatic play seems to involve both players; cheering would often escalate when one player gained momentum, and then his/her opponent suddenly turned the tables and made a comeback", with such a result drawing more enthusiasm than one competitor defeating the other without giving up any points.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Harper, ''The Culture of Digital Fighting Games: Performance and Practice'' (20130), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Fans are likely to feel better about a team that loses after staging a "comeback that fell just short" than a team that lost by the same score after having played evenly throughout the match and then allowed the other team the winning score at the end.&lt;ref&gt;
Tobias J. Moskowitz, L. Jon Wertheim, ''Scorecasting: The Hidden Influences Behind How Sports Are Played and Games Are Won'' (2012), p. 77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sports, particularly those regulated by a game clock, the time that it takes to score points makes a comeback impossible when there is too great a point disadvantage to overcome in the time remaining. It has been noted, however, that in "some sports, such as tennis or baseball, a comeback is possible until the very last point, regardless of what the deficit might be".&lt;ref name="Duina"&gt;Francesco Duina, ''Winning: Reflections on an American Obsession'' (2010), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Many sporting news outlets have compiled lists of "greatest comebacks" for various sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2057065-the-15-biggest-comebacks-in-sports|title=The 15 Biggest Comebacks in Sports|author=Nick Dimengo|work=Bleacher Report|date=May 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/09/the-10-greatest-comebacks-in-all-of-sports|title=The 10 greatest comebacks in sports history|author=Mike Foss|date=September 25, 2013|work=For The Win}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/02/06/people-bouncing-back_n_6629216.html|title=The Greatest Sporting Comebacks Of All Time|work=The Huffington Post UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/10330083/Top-ten-greatest-sporting-comebacks-of-all-time.html|title=Top-ten greatest sporting comebacks of all time|date=25 September 2013|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-nz/sport/news/great-comebacks-in-sports-history/ss-BBlX4bD#image=5|title=Great comebacks in sports history|work=msn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFGate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/slideshow/The-10-greatest-comebacks-in-sports-history-71046.php|title=The 10 greatest comebacks in sports history|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,562527,00.html|title=The 10 greatest comebacks of all time|work=theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;

Some academic study of sports comebacks has been conducted. One study indicated that in the sports of basketball, football and ice hockey, the team leading in points at the beginning of the final period of play wins the game 80% of the time, with the trailing team overcoming this disadvantage 20% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Paramjit S. Gilla, "Late-Game Reversals in Professional Basketball, Football, and Hockey", ''The American Statistician'', Vol. 54, No. 2 (May, 2000), pp. 94-99, DOI:10.1080/00031305.2000.10474518.&lt;/ref&gt; Another determined that the [[home team advantage]] has a significant impact on the probability of a team engineering a late comeback, noting that for professional basketball teams, "the home team is more than three times as likely to make a fourth-quarter comeback than is the visiting team (33.3% versus 10.5%)".&lt;ref&gt;Harris Cooper, Kristina M. Deneve, and Frederick Mosteller, "Predicting professional sports game outcomes from intermediate game scores", ''CHANCE'', Volume 5, Issue 3-4, 1992, p. 18-22, DOI:10.1080/09332480.1992.10554981.&lt;/ref&gt; A comeback by one competitor may coincide with, or be alternatively characterized as, a "[[Choke (sports)|choke]]" by the opponent allowing the comeback.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Heaton and Harold Sigall, "The “Championship Choke” Revisited: The Role of Fear of Acquiring a Negative Identity", ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology'', Vol. 19, No. 12 (September 1989), p. 1019–1033, DOI: 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1989.tb01236.x. See, e.g., Tony Lee, ''Greatest Rivalries in Sports'' (2014), p. 19: "Red Sox fans called it the greatest comeback in sports history. Or, if they wanted to insult the hated Yankees, they called it the biggest choke in sports history"; Sal Maiorana, ''Buffalo Bills: The Complete Illustrated History'' (2010), p. 131: "[T]he Bills somehow came together and pulled off the greatest comeback the NFL has ever seen..." but "'It was the biggest choke in history', Houston cornerback Cris Dishman said".&lt;/ref&gt;

==American football==
There is no official definition or statistic for comebacks in American football, but many fans note the ability of certain teams to mount a comeback late in the game. A team may have a '''second-half comeback''' after having fallen well behind in the first half, or a '''fourth-quarter comeback''' after having fallen well behind with only one quarter of play remaining.

Certain comebacks are particularly historically significant. For example, in [[American football]], "[[The Comeback (American football)|The Comeback]]" refers to a specific [[1992–93 NFL playoffs|NFL playoff game]] between the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] and the [[1992 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] played January 3, 1993. It featured the Bills recovering from a 32-point deficit shortly after halftime to win in [[Overtime (sport)|overtime]], 41–38, the largest comeback in terms of points in NFL history, postseason or regular season.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFGate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffith"&gt;R. D.

The [[2006 Michigan State vs. Northwestern football game]] featured the largest comeback in [[NCAA Division 1-A]] history, when the [[Michigan State Spartans]] rallied to score 38 unanswered points to beat the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] 41–38 after falling behind 38–3 with 9:54 left in the 3rd quarter.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=262940077 Spartans stun Cats for biggest comeback in I-A history]", ''ESPN'' (October 24, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2006 Insight Bowl]], the [[2006 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech Red Raiders]] completed the largest comeback in [[Bowl game|NCAA Division 1-A Bowl Game]] history. The [[2006 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] led 38-7 with 7:47 left in the 3rd quarter. Texas Tech quarterback [[Graham Harrell]] scored two touchdowns, running back Shannon Woods scored another TD, and kicker [[Alex Trlica]] hit the game-tying 52-yard field goal as time expired in regulation. Gophers QB [[Bryan Cupito]] led a drive capped off by a Joel Monroe field goal. Shannon Woods ended the game with a 3-yard rushing touchdown to complete the thrilling comeback. The [[2015 TCU Horned Frogs football team|2015-16 TCU Horned Frogs]] tied this record in the [[2016 Alamo Bowl (January)|2016 Alamo Bowl]].&lt;ref name="ESPN recap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=263630135 |title=Down 31, Texas Tech rallies for biggest bowl comeback |publisher=[[Associated Press]] via [[ESPN]] |date=December 29, 2006 |accessdate=30 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102204929/http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=263630135 |archivedate=2 January 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2016 Alamo Bowl (January)|2016 Valero Alamo Bowl]], the [[2015 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU Horned Frogs]] tied the aforementioned [[2006 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech Red Raiders]] for the largest comeback in [[Bowl game|NCAA Division 1-A Bowl Game]] history. The [[2015 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]] led 31-0 at halftime. The Ducks' star quarterback [[Vernon Adams|Vernon Adams Jr.]] left the game with an injury. TCU backup QB [[Bram Kohlhausen]] (who was playing for starter [[Trevone Boykin]] as he was suspended for off-the-field issues) led an unbelievable 31-point second half to tie the game. The Frogs ended up winning the game 47-41 in 3OT after the Ducks failed to convert on 4th Down.&lt;ref name=Engel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/mac-engel/article53024140.html |title=Bram Kohlhausen’s one career start capped thrilling TCU season |first=Mac |last=Engel |newspaper=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram|Star-Telegram]] |location=[[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth, TX]] |date=January 4, 2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association football==
The ability for a comeback to occur in [[association football]] is limited by the game clock.

A notable example of such a comeback is [[Charlton Athletic F.C. 7–6 Huddersfield Town A.F.C.]], 21 December 1957. With 27 minutes left, Charlton were losing 5–1 and down to ten men. However, they scored six more goals to win 7–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3060190.ece|title=Score six and lose: the day that left Bill Shankly speechless|newspaper=The Times|date=17 December 2007|accessdate=13 August 2010|author=Chalke, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,562527,00.html|title=The 10 greatest comebacks of all time|newspaper=The Observer|date=7 October 2001|author=Henderson, Jon|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a record breaking come back is [[F.C Barcelona]] (6-1, 6-5 on aggregate)  against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain F.C]] in the Champions league round of 16 on March 8, 2017 at Camp Nou, Barcelona. It was the first time that a team in  [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] history a team had overcome a four-goal deficit in order to qualify for the quarterfinals.

==Baseball==
In baseball, a comeback is theoretically possible at any point in the game up until the event that ends the game itself. There are no time constraints that would prevent a team from using its very last opportunity for play to score enough consecutive runs to win the game (or to tie the game, forcing [[extra innings]]).&lt;ref name="Duina"/&gt;

In terms of individual games, on three occasions in [[Major League Baseball]] history, a team has come back from being twelve runs down to win the game:
* June 18, 1911, the [[Detroit Tigers]] overcame a 12-run deficit against the [[Chicago White Sox]].&lt;ref name="USA Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/scores101/101217/101217313.htm|title=American League Baseball - Mariners vs. Indians|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaffe"&gt;Chris Jaffe, "[http://www.hardballtimes.com/tht-live/10-year-anniversary-of-baseballs-greatest-comeback/ 10-year anniversary of baseball’s greatest comeback]", ''Hardball Times'' (August 5, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Retrosheet"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1911/B06180DET1911.htm|title=Retrosheet Boxscore: Detroit Tigers 16, Chicago White Sox 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* June 15, 1925, the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] overcame a 12-run deficit against the [[Cleveland Indians]].&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaffe"/&gt;
* August 5, 2001, the [[Cleveland Indians]] overcame a 12-run deficit against the [[Seattle Mariners]], winning 15-14 in the 11th inning.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaffe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Turbow, Michael Duca, ''The Baseball Codes: Beanballs, Sign Stealing, and Bench-clearing Brawls'' (2011), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to comebacks over a series of multiple games, in MLB series play, the [[Boston Red Sox]] defeated the Yankees in 7 games in the [[2004 American League Championship Series]], after trailing 3-0 in the series.&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFGate"/&gt;

==Basketball==
A team may have a '''second-half comeback''' after having fallen well behind in the first half, or a '''fourth-quarter comeback''' after having fallen well behind with only one quarter of play remaining.

The greatest comeback in [[National Basketball Association]] play occurred on November 27, 1996, when the [[Utah Jazz]], down by 36 points to the [[Denver Nuggets]] in the third quarter, overcame this deficit to win 107-103.&lt;ref&gt;Dustin Long, ''Greatest Comebacks in Sports'' (2014), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest comeback in [[College basketball#NCAA Division I|NCAA Division I]] history occurred on February 22, 2018 when [[Drexel Dragons men's basketball|Drexel]] overcame a 34 point deficit against [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens men's basketball|Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2018/2/22/17043132/drexel-delaware-biggest-comeback-college-basketball |title=Drexel vs Delaware - Greatest comeback in D1 basketball history |website=sbnation.com |date=2018-02-22 |accessdate=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surpassed the previous record, a February 1994 game between the [[Kentucky Wildcats]] and the [[LSU Tigers basketball|Louisiana State University Tigers]], in which the Wildcats were down by 31 points, but came back to win 99–95.&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn R. Kahle, Chris Riley, ''Sports Marketing and the Psychology of Marketing Communication'' (2004), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Philippines, the [[San Miguel Beermen]] became the first basketball team in history to ever win a best-of-7 title series from 0-3 down after beating [[Alaska Aces (PBA)|Alaska Aces]] in Game 7 of the [[2015–16 PBA Philippine Cup Finals]].

In the [[2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], both games of the March 13 session set NCAA postseason records, for largest deficit overcome within the final five minutes of a game (16) and largest deficit at any point in the game overcome (25).

===NBA===
The following comebacks are based solely on a points deficit basis:

'''36 points — Utah Jazz vs. Denver Nuggets (November 27, 1996)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbasketball.us|title=NBA Comebacks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com|title=Jazz 107, Nuggets 103|last=|first=|date=November 28, 1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Utah Jazz defeated the Denver Nuggets 107 to 103 on November 27, 1996.  The Jazz, playing before a hometown crowd at the Delta Center, trailed 70 to 36 at halftime.  Led by the scoring efforts of Karl Malone with 31 points and Jeff Hornacek contributing 29 points, the Utah Jazz secured the win to overcome one of the largest deficits in NBA history.

'''35 points — Sacramento Kings vs. Chicago Bulls (December 21, 2009)'''&lt;ref name="NBA Comebacks"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allaboutbasketball.us|title=NBA Comebacks|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Sacramento Kings defeated the Chicago Bulls 102-98 on December 21, 2009 at Chicago's United Center.  Trailing three quarters, with the largest deficit at 35 points, the Kings rallied behind the scoring of Tyreke Evans' 23 points.  Sacramento  overcame the Bulls in the fourth quarter despite a 26-point performance of Chicago's Luol Deng. This comeback constitutes the second largest comeback in NBA history.

They were down by as high as 35 points with less than 9 minutes remaining in the third quarter. But despite trailing for almost three quarters, they fought their way back and beat Chicago Bulls by four points.

'''30 points — Dallas Mavericks vs. Los Angeles Lakers (December 6, 2002)'''&lt;ref name="NBA Comebacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The third largest NBA comeback occurred at Staples Center on December 6, 2002. The Los Angeles Lakers were down 30 in the 3rd quarter and trailing by 27 entering the 4th. On the back of 21 points from Kobe Bryant, the Lakers came back to win 105-103. Fittingly, Bryant scored with 8.4 seconds remaining, giving the Lakers their first lead of the game and held on for the win.

'''29 points — Milwaukee Bucks vs. Atlanta Hawks (November 25, 1977)'''&lt;ref name="NBA Comebacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fourth largest NBA comeback occurred at Atlanta's Omni Coliseum on November 25, 1977. The Milwaukee Bucks, down 29 points to the Atlanta Hawks, came back to win 117-115. This game is the largest fourth quarter comeback in NBA history.  Milwaukee's Junior Bridgerman led the comeback effort with 24 points and held off Atlanta's high scorer John Drew with 30 points   on the night.

'''29 points — Dallas Mavericks vs. Minnesota Timberwolves (December 30, 2008)'''&lt;ref name="NBA Comebacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dallas Mavericks defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 107 to 100 on December 30, 2008 to overcome a 29-point  third quarter deficit. Jason Terry led all Mavericks scorers with 29 points while Dirk Nowitzki added 24 points. The game was played at Dallas' American Airlines Center.

'''27 points — Miami Heat vs. Cleveland Cavaliers (March 20, 2013)'''&lt;ref name="NBA Comebacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At Quicken Loans Arena, the Miami Heat overcame at the time league high 27-point third-quarter deficit to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 98-95 and extend their winning streak to 24 games.

'''27 points — Toronto Raptors vs. Golden State Warriors (December 3, 2013)'''&lt;ref name="NBA Comebacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At Oracle Arena in Oakland, the visiting Toronto Raptors held a 75-48 advantage over the Golden State Warriors with just over 9 minutes remaining in the third quarter. Led by Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the Warriors outscored Toronto 64-28 in the final 21:20 by means of tremendous 3-point shooting to come away with a 112-103 win at home.

'''26 points - Atlanta Hawks vs. Dallas Mavericks (October 24, 2018)'''

The Atlanta Hawks overcame a 26-point deficit in the second quarter to beat the Dallas Mavericks with a final score of 111-104 at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.  

'''26 points - Boston Celtics vs. Houston Rockets (December 28, 2017)'''

The Boston Celtics overcame a 26-point deficit, coming back in the second half to beat the Houston Rockets with a final score of 99-98 at the TD Garden in Boston.

'''26 points - Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Indiana Pacers (April 20, 2017)'''

Trailing by as much as 26, the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame a 25-point half-time deficit (largest ever overcome), to take a commanding 3-0 First Round series lead over the Indiana Pacers and further fuel what would become a historic 10-game playoff win-streak. The 26-point comeback tied the largest ever in NBA post-season history (along with the 2012 Clippers against the Memphis Grizzlies), with LeBron James scoring 41 points and a triple-double in another career night performance. 

'''25 points - Golden State Warriors vs. San Antonio Spurs (May 14, 2017)'''

The Golden State Warriors came back from a 25 point deficit, led by Steph Curry's 40 points and Kevin Durant's 34 points. Curry led the team with 7 made threes and 14 made field goals. Precipitating the comeback was the injury of the Spurs' first option, Kawhi Leonard. The Warriors won 113-111.

'''25 points - Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Utah Jazz (April 25th, 2018)'''

The Oklahoma City Thunder erased a 25 point comeback in the third quarter of the NBA first round against the Utah Jazz. Russell Westbrook's 45 points and Paul George's 34 points saved the Thunder from elimination to force a game 6.

==Ice hockey==
The ability for a comeback to occur in [[ice hockey]] is limited by the game clock.

In [[National Hockey League]] series play, the 2010 [[Philadelphia Flyers]] became the third NHL team to win a seven-game series after being down 3–0 (the others being the [[1941–42 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] and the [[1974–75 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]]).&lt;ref name="USAToday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFGate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="double comeback"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nhl.com/ice/recap.htm?id=2009030227 |title= Double comeback: Flyers rally in Game 7 to advance |first= Brian |last= Compton |date= May 14, 2010 |publisher= National Hockey League |location= Boston, MA | accessdate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This feat was once again accomplished in 2014 by the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. After being down three games in their series against the [[San Jose Sharks]], the Kings rallied and won the next four. This momentum seemingly carried them in the remainder of their series, culminating with their winning the Stanley Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/comeback-kings-la-becomes-4th-team-to-erase-3-0-series-deficit-with-5-1-game-7-win-vs-sharks/c-717310|title=Comeback Kings: LA becomes 4th team to erase 3-0 series deficit with 5-1 Game 7 win vs Sharks|website=NHL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1995 Indianapolis 500]], [[Jacques Villeneuve]] overtook the pace car by mistake and was penalized with two laps, but recovered and won the race.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/memories/1995/95arac4.htm Villeneuve Wins Indianapolis 500] - Washington Post, 29 May 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tennis==

In professional [[tennis]], the match goes to the first player to win a predetermined number of sets, usually three or five in professional tournaments. There have been numerous instances of a player being down one or two sets to none, and coming back to win the remaining sets in a row to win the match. It is theoretically possible for a player to come back from a deficit at any point in the game.&lt;ref name="Duina"/&gt;

A notable example of such a comeback in tennis is the [[1999 French Open]] final, between [[Andre Agassi]] and [[Andrei Medvedev]], wherein Medvedev dominated the first two sets (1-6, 2-6) before Agassi mounted a come-from-behind victory, winning the remaining three sets (6-4, 6-3, 6-4) which allowed him to complete a career Grand Slam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121103173024/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1016147/index.htm String Quartet].

==Track and field==
In the [[10,000 metres]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] at [[Munich]], runner [[Lasse Virén]] fell in the twelfth lap after getting tangled with [[Emiel Puttemans]], with [[Tunisia]]'s Mohamed Gammoudi also falling after being tripped by Viren's legs. Despite losing about 20 metres, Virén caught up with, and then outpaced, the pack, breaking [[Ron Clarke]]'s 7-year-old [[10,000 metres world record progression|world record]] with a time of 27:38:40&lt;ref name="Huffpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mauno Saari, ''Lasse Viren:  The Secrets of Running'' / ''Lasse Viren – Juoksemisen salaisuudet'' (Finland, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2013 America's Cup]], [[Oracle Team USA]] (representing the [[Golden Gate Yacht Club]]), fell behind the challenger [[Emirates Team New Zealand]] (representing the [[Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron]]) by a score of 8 races to 1.

{{About|the discipline|the journal|Communication Theory (journal)}}
'''Communication theory''' is a field of [[information theory]] and [[mathematics]] that studies the technical process of information&lt;ref name="Shannon"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Mathematical Theory of Communication |last=Shannon |first=Claude Elwood |date=2011 |origyear=July and October 1948 |publisher=The Bell System Technical Journal |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=55 |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/what/shannonday/shannon1948.pdf |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the process of [[human communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Applying Communication Theory for Professional Life |last=Dainton |first=Marianne |authorlink= |author2=Elain D. Zellei |year=2011 |publisher= Sage Publications |location= |isbn=1-4129-7691-X |page= |pages=247 |url= http://www.sagepub.com/upm-data/4983_Dainton_Chapter_1.pdf |accessdate= November 4, 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally communication theory is “any systematic summary about the nature of the communication process” (Dainton, 2019). It “is a coherent field of metadiscursive practice, a field of discourse about discourse with implications for the practice of communication” (Craig, 1999, pg. 120) and seeks to “provide conceptual resources for reflecting on communication problems” (p. 130).

== History ==
{{Main|A Mathematical Theory of Communication|Jakobson's functions of language|Outline of communication|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

=== Origins ===
"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; [[Claude Shannon]] (1916–2001)

The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of [[information theory]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management Effectiveness and Communication, MBA 665, Online Resources, Communication Models |year=2008 |publisher=Bob Jones University |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Communication%20Models.htm |accessdate= November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.

[[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.

[[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information,'' uses the word "information" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.

[[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948 under the title "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He also used tools in [[probability theory]], developed by [[Norbert Wiener]]. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.

In 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]] ("[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] with his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

=== Models of communication ===
{{Main|Models of communication}}

The studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, [[Warren Weaver]] and others, prompted research on new [[Conceptual model|models]] of communication from other scientific perspectives like [[psychology]] and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Models in Science |last=Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModThe |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from disciplines different from [[mathematics]] and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':

{{Quotation|They developed a model of communication which was intended to assist in developing a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon and Weaver's work proved valuable for communication engineers in dealing with such issues as the capacity of various communication channels in 'bits per second'. It contributed to computer science. It led to very useful work on redundancy in language. And in making 'information' 'measurable' it gave birth to the mathematical study of 'information theory'|[[Daniel Chandler|D. Chandler]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transmission Model of Communication |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |year=1994 |publisher=University of Western Australia |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Robert T. Craig in his foundational publication, ''Communication Theory as a Field'' (1999), communication theory “consist of seven traditions that are […] characteristic of the field: rhetoric, semiotics, phenomenology, cybernetics, sociopsychology, sociocultural theory, and the critical approach.”

"Communication is a process of expression, interaction, and influence, in which the behavior of humans or other complex organisms expresses psychological mechanisms, states, and traits and, through interaction with the similar expressions of other individuals, produces a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects.” (Craig, 1999, p. 143)

== Elements of communication ==

Basic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communication process |publisher=Center for Literacy Studies of the University of Tennessee |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cls.utk.edu/pdf/ls/Week1_Lesson7.pdf |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Communication source|Source]]''': Shannon calls this element the "information source", which "produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Sender''': Shannon calls this element the "transmitter", which "operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; In Aristotle, this element is the "speaker" (orator).&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Rhetoric: Comprising an Analysis of the Laws of Moral Evidence |author1=Richard Whately |author2=Douglas Ehninger |author3=David Potter |year=1963 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8093-2974-8 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbgnLDdOkQC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Ehninger,+Aristotles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bkxHTlw9DZ&amp;sig=YdmF1zKKM74WOgoI_0jvYq6kUpo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hku3TsybFoGviQf7of2bAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel''': For Shannon, the channel is "merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Receiver''': For Shannon, the receiver "performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Destination''': For Shannon, the destination is "the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Message''': from [[Latin]] ''mittere'', "to send". The message is a [[concept]], information, communication, or [[:wikt:statement|statement]] that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.
* '''Feedback'''
* '''Entropic elements, positive and negative'''

A '''culprit''', under [[England|English]] [[law]] properly the [[prison]]er at the bar, is one accused of a [[crime]]. The term is used, generally, of one [[guilt (law)|guilty]] of an [[offence (law)|offence]]. In [[Etymology|origin]] the word is a combination of two [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-French]] legal words, culpable: guilty, and prit or prest: [[Old French]]: ready. On the prisoner at the bar pleading '''not''' guilty, the clerk of the crown answered culpable, and states that he was ready (prest) to join issue. The words "cul. prist" were then entered on the roll, showing that issue had been joined. When [[French law]] terms were discontinued, the words were taken as forming one word addressed to the prisoner.

The formula "Culprit, how will you be tried?" in answer to a plea of "not guilty," is first found in the trial for murder of the [[Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke|7th Earl of Pembroke]] in 1678.

Under this [[criminal law]], the preferred term is [[defendant]].

{{English grammar}}
A '''double negative''' is a grammatical construction occurring when two forms of [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] are used in the same sentence. '''Multiple negation''' is the more general term referring to the occurrence of more than one negative in a [[clause]]. In some languages, double negatives cancel one another and produce an affirmative; in other languages, doubled negatives intensify the negation. Languages where multiple negatives affirm each other are said to have '''negative concord''' or '''emphatic negation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wouden|first1=Ton van der|title=Negative Contexts: Collocation, Polarity and Multiple Negation|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134773336|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d72GAgAAQBAJ&amp;&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and some  dialects of [[English language|English]], such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], are examples of negative-concord languages,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} while [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] do not have negative concord. It is cross-linguistically observed that negative-concord languages are more common than those without.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Languages without negative concord typically have [[negative polarity]] items that are used in place of additional negatives when another negating word already occurs.  Examples are "ever", "anything" and "anyone" in the sentence "I haven't ever owed anything to anyone" (cf. "I have&lt;u&gt;''n't''&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;''never''&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;''nothing''&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;''no one''&lt;/u&gt;" in negative-concord dialects of English, and "&lt;u&gt;''Nunca''&lt;/u&gt; devi &lt;u&gt;''nada''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''ninguém''&lt;/u&gt;" in Portuguese, lit. "Never have I owed nothing to no one", or "&lt;u&gt;''Non''&lt;/u&gt; ho &lt;u&gt;''mai''&lt;/u&gt; dovuto &lt;u&gt;''nulla''&lt;/u&gt; a &lt;u&gt;''nessuno''&lt;/u&gt;" in Italian).  Note that negative polarity can be triggered not only by direct negatives such as "not" or "never", but also by words such as "doubt" or "hardly" ("I doubt he has ever owed anything to anyone" or "He has hardly ever owed anything to anyone").

Stylistically, in English, double negatives can sometimes be used for affirmation (e.g. "I'm not feeling not good"), an  [[understatement]] of the positive ("I'm feeling good").  The rhetorical term for this is [[litotes]].

==English==
===Two negatives resolving to a positive===
When two negatives are used in one independent clause, in standard English the negatives are understood to cancel one another and produce a weakened affirmative:{{rp|see the Robert Lowth citation below}} this is known as [[litotes]]. However, depending on how such a sentence is constructed, in some dialects if a verb or adverb is in between two negatives then the latter negative is assumed to be intensifying the former thus adding weight or feeling to the negative clause of the sentence. For this reason, it is difficult to portray double negatives in writing as the level of intonation to add weight in one's speech is lost. A double negative intensifier does not necessarily require the prescribed steps, and can easily be ascertained by the mood or intonation of the speaker.
* ''There isn't no other way.''

vs.
* ''There isn't no other way!''

These two sentences would be different in how they are communicated by speech. Any assumption would be correct, and the first sentence can be just as right or wrong in intensifying a negative as it is in cancelling it out; thereby rendering the sentence's meaning ambiguous. Since there is no adverb or verb to support the latter negative, the usage here is ambiguous and lies totally on the context behind the sentence. In light of punctuation, the second sentence can be viewed as the intensifier; and the former being a statement thus an admonishment.
&lt;!-- The following is a clever anecdote but not directly relevant --&gt;
&lt;!-- The context-dependent nature of this rhetorical device in English is illustrated in a well-known linguistic anecdote. Oxford philosopher of language [[J. L. Austin]] gave a lecture in which he noted that there are many languages wherein a double negative makes a positive, but none in which a double positive makes a negative.  From the audience, Columbia philosopher [[Sidney Morgenbesser]] replied, "Yeah, yeah."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001314.html|title=IF P, SO WHY NOT Q?|work=Language Log|author=[[Mark Liberman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

In [[standard written English|Standard English]], two negatives are understood to resolve to a positive. This rule was observed as early as 1762, when Bishop [[Robert Lowth]] wrote ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar with Critical Notes''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Fromkin|first = Victoria |author2=Rodman, Robert |author3=Hyams, Nina|title = An Introduction to Language, Seventh Edition|publisher = Heinle|year = 2002|page = 15|isbn = 0-15-508481-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, "I do not disagree" could mean "I certainly agree",  "I agree", "I sort of agree", "I don't understand your point of view", "I have no opinion", and so on; it is a form of "[[weasel word]]s". Further statements are necessary to resolve which particular meaning was intended.

This is opposed to the single negative "I do not agree", which typically means "I disagree". However,  the statement "I do not completely disagree" is a similar double negative to "I do not disagree" but needs little or no clarification.

With the meaning "I completely agree", Lowth would have been referring to [[litotes]] wherein two negatives simply cancel each other out. However, the usage of intensifying negatives and examples are presented in his work, which could also imply he wanted either usage of double negatives abolished. Because of this ambiguity, double negatives are frequently employed when making [[back-handed compliments]]. The phrase "Mr. Jones was not incompetent." will seldom mean "Mr. Jones was very competent" since the speaker would have found a more flattering way to say so. Instead, some kind of problem is implied, though Mr. Jones possesses basic competence at his tasks.

===Two or more negatives resolving to a negative===
[[File:friar-canterbury-tales.jpg|thumb|right|The Friar from the [[Ellesmere Chaucer|Ellesmere Manuscript]] of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]’s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'']]
Discussing English grammar, the term "double negative" is often&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition. Op. cit. [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/double+negative Merriam-Webster Online]. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; though not universally&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/double+negative The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], 4th ed. Houghton Mifflin Co, 2009. Accessed 29 Sept. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memidex.com/double-negative |title=double negative |work=Memidex/WordNet Dictionary |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied to the [[Standard English|non-standard]] use of a second negative as an intensifier to a negation.

Double negatives are usually associated with regional and ethnical dialects such as [[Southern American English]], [[African American Vernacular English]], and various British regional dialects. Indeed, they were used in [[Middle English]]. Historically, [[Chaucer]] made extensive use of double, triple, and even quadruple negatives in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. About the Friar, he writes "Ther nas no man no wher so vertuous" ("There never was no man nowhere so virtuous"). About the Knight, "He nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde / In all his lyf unto no maner wight" ("He never yet no vileness didn't say / In all his life to no manner of man").

Following the [[battle of Marston Moor]], [[Oliver Cromwell]] quoted his nephew's dying words in a letter to the boy's father [[Valentine Walton]]: "A little after, he said one thing lay upon his spirit. I asked him what it was. He told me it was that God had not suffered him to be no more the executioner of His enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Antonia, ''Cromwell Lord Protector'', at 129, Primus, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-917657-90-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=088_AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=God+had+not+suffered+him&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IL07T6XbOqG90AG75pmqCw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=God%20had%20not%20suffered%20him&amp;f=false John Forster], ''Statesmen of the Commonwealth of England with a Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History'', pp. 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this particular letter has often been reprinted, it is frequently changed to read "not ... to be any more" instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Whereas some double negatives may resolve to a positive, in some dialects others resolve to intensify the negative clause within a sentence. For example:
* ''I didn't go nowhere today.
* ''I'm not hungry no more.
* ''You don't know nothing.
* ''There was never no more laziness at work than before.

In contrast, some double negatives become positives:
* ''I didn't '''not''' go to the park today.
* ''We can't '''not''' go to sleep!

The key to understanding the former examples and knowing whether a double negative is intensive or negative is finding a verb between the two negatives. If a verb is present between the two, the latter negative becomes an intensifier which does not negate the former.  In the first example, the verb ''to go'' separates the two negatives; therefore the latter negative does not negate the already negated verb.  Indeed, the word 'nowhere' is thus being used as an [[adverb]] and does not negate the argument of the sentence. One interesting thing to note is that double negatives such as ''I don't want to know no more'' contrasts with Romance languages such as French in ''Je ne veux pas savoir.'' &lt;ref&gt;See the article regarding Romance languages explaining this form of double negation.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exception is when the second negative is stressed, as in ''I'm not doing {{em|nothing}}; I'm thinking.''  A sentence can otherwise usually only become positive through consecutive uses of negatives, such as those prescribed in the later examples, where a clause is void of a verb and lacks an adverb to intensify it.  Two of them also use emphasis to make the meaning clearer. The last example is a popular example of a double negative that resolves to a positive. This is because the verb 'to doubt' has no intensifier which effectively resolves a sentence to a positive. Had we added an adverb thus:
* ''I have no doubt never this sentence is false.''

Then what happens is that the verb ''to doubt'' becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the sentence is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb 'more' merges with the prefix ''no-'' to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentence's former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb ''hungry''. Where people think that the sentence ''I'm not hungry no more'' resolves to a positive is where the latter negative ''no'' becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart ''more'' which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase ''no more'' is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives aren't acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., {{nowrap|1=− −2 = +2}}; therefore, it is argued, ''I did not go nowhere'' resolves to ''I went somewhere''.

Other forms of double negatives, which are popular to this day and do strictly enhance the negative rather than destroying it, are described thus:

:''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] nor [[Existentialism]].''

Philosophies aside, this form of double negative is still in use whereby the use of 'nor' enhances the negative clause by emphasizing what isn't to be. Opponents of double negatives would have preferred ''I'm not entirely familiar with [[Nihilism]] or [[Existentialism]]''; however this renders the sentence somewhat empty of the negative clause being advanced in the sentence. This form of double negative along with others described are standard ways of intensifying as well as enhancing a negative. The use of 'nor' to emphasise the negative clause is still popular today, and has been popular in the past through works of Shakespeare and Milton:

:''Nor did they not perceive the evil plight''
:''In which they were'' ~ [[John Milton]] - [[Paradise Lost]]

:''I never was, nor never will be'' ~ [[William Shakespeare]] - [[Richard III]]

To the common reader the negatives herein do not cancel each other out but simply emphasizes the negative clause.

Up to the 18th century, double negatives were used to emphasize negation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.american.edu/cas/tesol/resources/upload/Kirby_Philippa.pdf Philippa Kirby], ''Double and Multiple Negatives, p. 2''&lt;/ref&gt; "Prescriptive grammarians" recorded and codified a shift away from the double negative in the 1700s. Double negatives continue to be spoken by those of Vernacular English, such as those of Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 4''&lt;/ref&gt; To such speakers, they view double negatives as emphasizing the negative rather than cancelling out the negatives. Researchers have studied African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and trace its origins back to colonial English.&lt;ref&gt;''p. 5''&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that double negatives were present in colonial English, and thus presumably English as a whole, and were acceptable at that time. English after the 18th century was changed to become more logical and double negatives became seen as canceling each other as in mathematics. The use of double negatives became associated with being uneducated and illogical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/02/grammar-myths-3/], ''Oxford Dictionaries Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Essay towards a practical English Grammar'' of 1711, [[James Greenwood (grammarian)|James Greenwood]] first recorded the rule: "Two Negatives, or two Adverbs of Denying do in English affirm".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  [[Robert Lowth]] stated in his grammar textbook ''A Short Introduction to English Grammar'' (1762) that "two negatives in English destroy one another, or are equivalent to an affirmative".{{sfn|Kallel|2011|p=131}}  Grammarians have assumed that Latin was the model for Lowth and other early grammarians in prescribing against negative concord, as Latin does not feature it.  Data indicates, however, that negative concord had already fallen into disuse in Standard English by the time of Lowth's grammar, and no evidence exists that the loss was driven by prescriptivism, which was well established by the time it appeared.{{sfn|Kallel|2011|pp=130–131}}

===In film and television===
[[file:I wont not use no double negatives.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bart Simpson]] attempting his exercise of double negatives in the [[Simpsons]] episode [[Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder]]]]
Double negatives have been employed in various films and television shows. In the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the [[chimney sweep]] Bert employs a double negative when he says, "If you don't want to go nowhere..." Another is used by the bandits in the "[[stinking badges|Stinking Badges]]" scene of [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'': "Badges? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges!".

More recently, the British television show ''[[EastEnders]]'' has received some publicity over the [[Estuary English|Estuary]] accent of character [[Dot Branning]], who speaks with double and triple negatives ("I ain't never heard of no licence.").{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. In the [[Harry Enfield]] sketch "Mr Cholmondley-Warner's Guide to the Working-Class", a stereotypical Cockney employs a septuple-negative: "Inside toilet? I ain't never not heard of one of them nor I ain't nor nothing."

In music, double negatives can be employed to similar effect (as in [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Another Brick in the Wall]]", in which schoolchildren chant "We don't need no education / We don't need no thought control") or used to establish a frank and informal tone (as in [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]").

==Germanic languages==
Double negation is uncommon in other [[West Germanic languages]]. A notable exception is [[Afrikaans]], where it is mandatory (for example, "He cannot speak Afrikaans" becomes ''Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie'', "He cannot Afrikaans speak not"). Dialectal Dutch, French and [[Khoisan languages|San]] have been suggested as possible origins for this trait. Its proper use follows a set of fairly complex rules as in these examples provided by Bruce Donaldson:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzioRvJzTUC&amp;q=double+negative#v=onepage&amp;q=Ek%20het%20nie%20geweet%20dat%20hy%20sou%20kom%20nie&amp;f=false |title=''A Grammar of Afrikaans'', Bruce C. Donaldson, Walter de Gruyter, 1993, p. 404 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ek het '''nie''' geweet dat hy sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I did not know that he would be coming.")
* ''Ek het geweet dat hy '''nie''' sou kom '''nie'''''. ("I knew that he would not be coming.")
* ''Hy sal '''nie''' kom '''nie''', want hy is siek''. ("He will not be coming because he is sick.")
* ''Dit is '''nie''' so moeilik om Afrikaans te leer '''nie'''''. ("It is not so difficult to learn Afrikaans.")

Another point of view is that this construction is not really an example of a "double negative" but simply a grammatical template for negation.  The second ''nie'' cannot be understood as a noun or adverb (as can, e.g., ''pas'' in French), and cannot be substituted by any part of speech other than itself with the sentence remaining grammatical.  It is a grammatical particle with no independent meaning that happens to be spelled and pronounced the same as the embedded ''nie'', meaning "not", through historical accident.

The second ''nie'' is used if and only if the sentence or phrase doesn't already end with ''nie'' or another negating adverb.
* ''Ek sien jou '''nie'''''. ("I don't see you")
* ''Ek sien jou '''nooit'''''. ("I never see you")

Afrikaans shares with English the property that two negatives make a positive.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} For example,
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't agree with you." )
* ''Ek stem '''nie''' '''nié''' met jou saam '''nie'''''. ("I don't ''not'' agree with you," i.e., I agree with you.)

While double negation is still found in the [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian dialects]] of west [[Flanders]] (e.g., ''Ik ne willen da nie doen'', "I do not want to do that") and in some villages in the central Netherlands such as [[Garderen]], it takes a different form than that found in Afrikaans. In [[Belgian Dutch]] dialects, however, there are still some widely used expressions like ''nooit niet'' ("never not") for "never".

Similar to some dialectal English, [[Austro-Bavarian language|Bavarian]] employs both single and double negation, with the latter denoting special emphasis. For example, compare the Bavarian ''Des hob i no nia ned g'hört'' ("This have I yet never not heard") with the standard German "Das habe ich noch nie gehört". The German emphatic "niemals!" (roughly "never ever") corresponds to Bavarian "(går) nia ned" or even "nie nicht" in Standard German pronunciation.

Another exception is [[Yiddish]]. Due to [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] influence, the double (and sometimes even triple) negative is quite common.

A few examples would be:
* איך האב '''קיינמאל''' '''נישט''' געזאגט ("I '''never''' '''didn't''' say")
* איך האב נישט '''קיין''' מורא פאר '''קיינעם''' '''ניט''' "I have '''no''' fear of '''no one not'''")
* It is common to add נישט ("not") after the Yiddish word גארנישט ("nothing"), i.e. איך האב גארנישט נישט געזאגט ("I have said nothing")

==Latin and Romance languages==
While in Latin a second negative word appearing along with ''non'' turns the meaning into a positive one: ''ullus'' means "any", ''nullus'' means "no", ''non...nullus'' (''nonnullus'') means "some". In the same way, ''umquam'' means "ever", ''numquam'' means "never", ''non...numquam'' (''nonnumquam'') means "sometimes", in many Romance languages a second term indicated a negative is required.

[[French grammar#Negation|In French]], the usual way to express negation is to employ two negatives, e.g. ''ne [verb] pas'', ''ne [verb] plus'', or ''ne [verb] jamais'', as in the sentences "Je ne sais pas" ("I do not know"), "Il n'y a plus de baguettes" ("There aren't any more baguettes"), and "On ne sait jamais" ("one never knows"). The second term was originally an emphatic; ''pas'', for example, derives from the Latin ''passus'', meaning "step", so that French ''Je ne marche pas'' and Catalan ''No camino pas'' originally meant "I will not walk a single step." This initial usage spread so thoroughly that it became a necessary element of any negation in the modern French language&lt;ref&gt;There are literary cases in which "ne" can be used without "pas"; many of these are traditional phrases stemming from a time before the emphatic became an essential part of negation.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, in fact, in contemporary French, the original actual negative ''ne'' is mostly left away in favour of ''pas'', as in ''Je sais pas'' "I don't know". In [[Northern Catalan]], ''no'' may be omitted in colloquial language, and [[Occitan language|Occitan]], which uses ''non'' only as a short answer to questions. In [[Venetian language|Venetian]], the double negation ''no ... mìa'' can likewise lose the first particle and rely only on the second: ''magno mìa'' ("I eat not") and ''vegno mìa'' ("I come not"). These exemplify [[Jespersen's cycle]].

[[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] languages usually employ doubled negative [[correlative]]s. Portuguese ''Não vejo nada'', Romanian ''Nu văd nimic'' and Italian ''Non vedo niente''&lt;ref&gt;In Italian a simple–negative phrase, ''Non vedo alcunché'' ("I don't see anything"), is also possible.&lt;/ref&gt; ("I do not see nothing") are used to express "No, I do not see anything". In Italian, a second following negative particle ''non'' turns the phrase into a positive one, but with a slightly different meaning. For instance, while both ''Voglio mangiare'' ("I want to eat") and ''Non voglio non mangiare'' ("I don't want not to eat") mean "I want to eat", the latter phrase more precisely means "I'd prefer to eat".

Other Romance languages employ double negatives less regularly. In [[Asturian language|Asturian]], an extra negative particle is used with negative adverbs: ''Yo nunca nun lu viera'' ("I had not never seen him") means "I have never seen him" and ''A mi tampoco nun me presta'' ("I neither do not like it") means "I do not like it either". Standard Catalan and Galician also used to possess a tendency to double ''no'' with other negatives, so ''Jo tampoc no l'he vista'' or ''Eu tampouco non a vira'', respectively ("I neither have not seen her") meant "I have not seen her either". That practice is dying out.

In 1974, Italy held [[Italian_divorce_referendum,_1974#Confusion_about_voting_methods|a referendum]] on whether to repeal a recent law that allowed divorce.  Voters were said to have been confused in that in order to support divorce, they needed to vote 'no' on the referendum which was worded so that 'yes' would support repeal.  And to reframe the fundamental underlying issue as being support/non-support of the continuation of marriage, then the vote was structured as a triple negative (with divorce as the negation of the continuation of marriage being the first negative).  This referendum was defeated, and without this confusion, it was said that it would have been defeated more decisively.

==Welsh==
In spoken [[Welsh language|Welsh]], the word '''ddim''' (not) often occurs with a prefixed or [[Consonant mutation|mutated]] verb form that is negative in meaning: ''Dydy hi ddim yma'' (word-for-word, "Not-is she not here") expresses "She is not here" and ''Chaiff Aled ddim mynd'' (word-for-word, "Not-will-get Aled not go") expresses "Aled is not allowed to go".

Negative correlatives can also occur with already negative verb forms. In literary Welsh, the mutated verb form is caused by an initial negative particle, '''ni''' or '''nid'''.  The particle is usually omitted in speech but the mutation remains: ''[Ni] wyddai neb'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-knew nobody") means "Nobody knew" and ''[Ni] chaiff Aled fawr o bres'' (word-for-word, "[Not] not-will-get Aled lots of money") means "Aled will not get much money". This is not usually regarded as three negative markers, however, because the negative mutation is really just an effect of the initial particle on the following word.&lt;ref&gt;

==Greek==
===Ancient Greek===
Doubled negatives are perfectly correct in [[Ancient Greek]].  With few exceptions, a simple negative (οὐ or μή) following another negative (for example, οὐδείς, ''no one'') results in an affirmation: οὐδείς οὐκ ἔπασχε τι ("No one was not suffering") means more simply "Everyone was suffering". Meanwhile, a compound negative following a negative strengthens the negation: μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ("Do not permit no one to raise an uproar") means "Let not a single one among them raise an uproar".

Those constructions apply only when the negatives all refer to the same word or expression. Otherwise, the negatives simply work independently of one another: οὐ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἀκοντίζειν οὐκ ἔβαλον αὐτόν means "It was not on account of their not throwing that they did not hit him", and one should not blame them for not trying.

===Modern Greek===
In [[Modern Greek]], negative concord is standard and more commonly used. For example, the sentence 'You (pl.) will not find anything' can be said in two ways: 'Δε θα βρείτε τίποτα' ('Not will find nothing') is more common than 'Δε θα βρείτε κάτι' ('Not will find something'). It depends simply on the mood of the speaker, and the latter being is considered slightly more polite. An exception to that rule is the (archaic) pronoun ουδείς, also meaning "no one", which does not allow negation of the verb that it governs.

==Slavic languages==
In [[Slavic languages]] other than [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic]], multiple negatives are grammatically correct ways to express negation, and a single negative is often incorrect. In complex sentences, every part that could be grammatically negated should be negative. For example, in the [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], ''Ni(t)ko nikad(a) nigd(j)e ništa nije uradio'' ("Nobody never did not do nothing nowhere") means "Nobody has ever done anything, anywhere", and ''Nikad nisam tamo išao/išla'' ("Never I did not go there") means "I have never been there". In Czech it is also common to use  three or more negations. For example, ''Nikdy jsem nikde nikoho neviděl'' ("I have not never seen no one nowhere"). In Russian, "I know nothing" is я ничего не знаю (''ya nichevo nye znayu''), lit. "I nothing don't know."

A single negation, while syntactically correct, may result in a very unusual meaning or make no sense at all. Saying "I saw nobody" in [[Polish language|Polish]] (''Widziałem nikogo'') instead of the more usual "I did not see nobody" (''Nikogo nie widziałem'') might mean "I saw an instance of nobody" or "I saw Mr. Nobody" but it would not have its plain English meaning. Likewise, in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], saying "I do not know anyone" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam kogarkoli}}'') in place of "I do not know no one" (''{{lang|sl|Ne poznam nikogar}}'') has the connotation "I do not know just ''anyone''": I know someone important or special.

==Baltic languages==
As with most [[synthetic language|synthetic]] ''[[centum-satem isogloss|satem]]'' languages double negative is mandatory{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} in [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Furthermore, all verbs and [[indefinite pronoun]]s in a given statement must be negated, so it could be said that multiple negative is mandatory in Latvian.

For instance, a statement "I have '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" would be rendered as ''es '''ne'''kad '''ne'''vienam '''ne'''ko '''ne'''esmu bijis parādā''. The only alternative would be using a negating [[subordinate clause]] and [[subjunctive]] in the [[main clause]], which could be approximated in English as "there has '''not''' &lt;u&gt;ever&lt;/u&gt; been an instance that I would have owed &lt;u&gt;anything&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;anyone&lt;/u&gt;" ('''''nav''' bijis tā, ka es &lt;u&gt;kādreiz&lt;/u&gt; būtu &lt;u&gt;kādam&lt;/u&gt; bijis &lt;u&gt;kaut ko&lt;/u&gt; parādā''), where negative pronouns (''nekad, neviens, nekas'') are replaced by [[indefinite pronoun]]s (''kādreiz, kāds, kaut kas'') more in line with the English "ever, any" indefinite pronoun structures.

==Uralic languages==
Double or multiple negatives are grammatically required in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] with negative pronouns: ''Nincs semmim'' (word for word: "[doesn't-exists] [nothing-of-mine]", and translates literally as "I do not have nothing") means "I do not have anything". Negative pronouns are constructed by means of adding the prefixes ''se-,'' ''sem-,'' and ''sen-'' to interrogative pronouns.

Something superficially resembling double negation is required also in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which uses the [[auxiliary verb]] ''ei'' to express negation. Negative pronouns are constructed by adding one of the suffixes ''-an,'' ''-än,'' ''-kaan,'' or ''-kään'' to interrogative pronouns: ''Kukaan ei soittanut minulle'' means "No one called me". These suffices are, however, never used alone, but always in connection with ''ei''. This phenomenon is commonplace in Finnish, where many words have alternatives that are required in negative expressions, for example ''edes'' for ''jopa'' ("even"), as in ''jopa niin paljon'' meaning "even so much", and ''ei edes niin paljoa'' meaning "not even so much".

==Turkish==

Negative verb forms are grammatically required in [[Turkish grammar|Turkish]] phrases with negative pronouns or adverbs that impart a negative meaning on the whole phrase. For example, ''Hiçbir şeyim yok'' (literally, word for word, "Not-one thing-of-mine exists-not") means "I don't have anything". Likewise, ''Asla memnun değilim'' (literally, "Never satisfied not-I-am") means "I'm never satisfied".

==Japanese==
Japanese employs [[litotes]] to phrase ideas in a more indirect and polite manner. Thus, one can indicate necessity by emphasizing that not doing something would not be proper. For instance, しなければならない (''shinakereba naranai'', "must") literally means "not doing [it] would not be proper". しなければいけません (''shinakereba ikemasen'', also "must") similarly means "not doing [it] cannot go forward".

Of course, indirectness can also be employed to put an edge on one's rudeness as well. "He has studied Japanese, so he should be able to write kanji" can be phrased 彼は日本語を勉強したから漢字で書けないわけがありません (''kare wa nihongo o benkyō shita kara kanji de kakenai wake ga arimasen''), there is a rather harsher idea: "As he has studied Japanese, the reasoning that he cannot write Kanji does not exist".

==Chinese==
[[Mandarin Chinese]] also employs [[litotes]] in a like manner. One common construction is '''不'''得'''不''' ([[Hanyu Pinyin|Pinyin]]: ''[[wikt:bùdébù|bùdébù]]'', "cannot not"), which is used to express (or feign) a necessity more regretful and polite than that expressed by 必须 (''[[wikt:bìxū|bìxū]]'', "must"). Compared with "我必须走" (''Wǒ bìxū zǒu'', "I must go"), "我'''不'''得'''不'''走" (''Wǒ bùdébù zǒu'', "I cannot not go") tries to emphasize that the situation is out of the speaker's hands and that the speaker has no choice in the matter: "Unfortunately, I have got to go". Similarly, "'''没有'''人'''不'''知道" (''Méiyǒu rén bù zhīdào'', "There is '''not''' a person who does '''not''' know") is a more emphatic way to express "Everyone knows".

Double negatives nearly always resolve to a positive meaning even in colloquial speech, while triple negatives resolve to a negative meaning. For example, "我'''不'''相信'''没'''人'''不'''来" (''Wǒ bù xiāngxìn méi rén bù lái'', "I do '''not''' believe '''no''' one will '''not''' come") means "I do not think everyone will come". However, triple or multiple negatives are considered obscure and are typically avoided.

==History of languages==
[[File:Jespersen's cycle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of Jespersen's cycle in French]]
{{main|Jespersen's Cycle}}
Many languages, including all living Germanic languages, French, Welsh and some Berber and Arabic dialects, have gone through a process known as [[Jespersen's cycle]], where an original negative particle is replaced by another, passing through an intermediate stage employing two particles (e.g. [[Old French]] ''jeo ne dis'' → Modern Standard French ''je ne dis pas'' → Modern Colloquial French ''je dis pas'' "I don't say").

In many cases, the original sense of the new negative particle is not negative ''per se'' (thus in French ''pas'' "step", originally "not a step" = "not a bit"), but in Germanic languages, such as English and German the intermediate stage was a case of double negation, as the current negatives ''not'' and ''nicht'' in these languages originally meant "nothing": e.g. [[Old English]] ''ic ne seah'' "I didn't see" &gt;&gt; [[Middle English]] ''I ne saugh nawiht'', lit. "I didn't see nothing" &gt;&gt; [[Early Modern English]] ''I saw not''.&lt;ref&gt;Kastovsky, Dieter. 1991. Historical English syntax. p. 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gelderen, Elly. 2006. ''A history of the English language''. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar development to a [[circumfix]] from double negation can be seen in non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, too: for example, in [[Maltese language|Maltese]], ''kiel'' "he ate" is negated as ''ma kielx'' "he did not eat", where the verb is preceded by a negative particle ''ma''- "not" and followed by the particle -''x'', which was originally a shortened form of ''xejn'' "nothing" - thus, "he didn't eat nothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmalta.com/language/maltesegrammar.htm#ver |title=Grazio Falzon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1552">In [[phonetics]], '''downdrift''' (also known as 'automatic [[downstep]]') is the cumulative lowering of pitch in the course of a sentence due to interactions among [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s in a [[tonal language]]. The usual cause of downdrift is when the tones in three successive syllables are H L H. In this case the second high tone tends to be lower than the first. The effect can accumulate so that with each low tone, the pitch of the high tones becomes slightly lower, until the end of the intonational phrase, when the pitch is 'reset'.&lt;ref&gt;Connell (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Two basic types of downdrift are found. In one, called ''discrete downdrift'', when downstep occurs all tones shift downward, so that their relative difference in pitch remains constant; in the other, called ''[[tone terracing]],'' the pitch of the low tone remains at the lower end of the speaker's vocal range, while the other tones shift downward, so that their difference in pitch narrows.

[[Pitch reset]] is required in the first instance because the tones approach the lower end of the speaker's comfort range, and in the second because the tonal distinctions of the language start being lost.

The '''downhaul''' is a [[rope|line]] which is part of the [[running rigging|rigging]] on a [[sailboat]]; it applies downward force on a [[spar (sailing)|spar]] or [[sail]]. The most common downhaul on a modern sailboat is attached to the [[spinnaker pole]], though this may be referred to as the [[foreguy]] in some rigging nomenclature. The term is also commonly applied to the [[Cunningham (sailing)|cunningham]] on the [[mainsail]].

In a [[windsurfing]] rig, the downhaul is the primary load-bearing line which controls the sail's shape. Modern windsurfing sails incorporate a sleeve for the mast, and therefore do not have a [[halyard]] which tensions the top of the sail. The downhaul is tensioned early in the rigging process and is generally not adjustable on the water, and is therefore rather different in use than the downhaul on a sailboat.

'''Elena M. Patron''' is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] scriptwriter, novelist, poet, dramatist, essayist, and magazine columnist.  Patron was one of the few [[women in the Philippines]] who ventured and succeeded in writing for [[Philippine comics]], a field that was dominated by [[Men in the Philippines|Filipino male]] writers.&lt;ref name=Komiks&gt;[http://komiklopedia.wordpress.com/2008/01/02/elena-m-patron/ Elena M. Patron by Komiklopedia on 2008/01/02], komiklopedia.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Patron was a writer for the women’s pages and movies sections of [[Liwayway]] magazine.  During her tenure as a writer-interviewer of showbusiness personalities, Patron was able to interview American actor [[Jeffrey Hunter]], American singer [[Paul Anka]], and some [[beauty queen]]s, among others.  Her magazine columns included ''Buhay May-asawa'' (Married Life), ''Psychopathic'', ''Munting-lupa'' (literally Small Portion of Land), and ''Alta-Sosyedad'' (High [level of] Society).   She became interested in scriptwriting and writing novels for the field of Philippine comics after her ''Mga Payo ni Ate Mameng'' (Older Sister Mameng’s Advice) column in the pages of Liwayway magazine was converted into comic book format.  Her first comic book novel was ''Kapatid Ko ang Aking Ina'' (My Sister is My Mother), a novel that was adapted into a film that gave her a [[Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Award]] (FAMAS Award) for best story.  Among her other novels were ''Isinilang Ko ang Anak ng Ibang Babae'' (I Gave Birth to the Child of Another Woman), ''Dalawa ang Nagdalantao sa Akin'' (There Were Two Who Became Pregnant for Me), ''Ako si Emma, Babae'' (I am Emma, a Woman), ''Padre, si Eba'' ([[Priest|Father]], This is [[Eve]]), ''Bago N’yo Ako Sumpain'' (Before You Curse Me), ''Lord, Give Me a Lover'', ''Ang Mukha ni Aniana'' (Aniana's Face), ''Eladia'', ''Sa Lilim ng Ilang-Ilang'' (Under the Shade of the [[Ilang-ilang]] Tree), ''Cara'', ''Bibo'' ([[wikt:dapper|Dapper]]), and ''Sleeping Beauty''. Her ''Sleeping Beauty'' was a prominent novel in Aliwan Komiks.  During the 1990s, upon the decline of Philippine comics readership, Patron moved into writing novels for [[Tagalog-language]] [[paperback]]s, locally known as [[Tagalog pocketbooks]].&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

==Film adaptation==
Among Patron’s novels that had been adapted into films included ''Lord, Give Me a Lover'', ''Adult Kid'', ''Ako si Emma, Babae'' (I am Emma, a Woman), ''Isinilang Ko ang Anak ng Ibang Babae'' (I Gave Birth to the Child of Another Woman), ''Pompa'', ''Dalawa ang Nagdalantao sa Akin'' (There Were Two Who Became Pregnant for Me), ''Padre, si Eba'' (Father, This is Eve), ''Bago N’yo Ako Sumpain'' (Before You Curse Me), ''Ligaw-Tingin, Halik-Hangin'' (Courtship Through Gazing, Kissing in the Wind [undemonstrated desire to court and kiss a person admired; the suitor can only look at the admired woman, unable to get closer, a kisser of empty space]), and ''Kape’t Gatas'' (literally Coffee and Milk; figuratively Brown and White [referring to skin color]).&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

==Awards==
Apart from her FAMAS-award-winning novel ''Kapatid Ko ang Aking Ina'', Patron obtained awards from The Citizen’s Council for Mass Media (CCMM), Starlight Cultural Foundation, Komiks Operation Brotherhood, Inc. (KOMOPEB), and the Catholic Mass Media.&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

==Family==
Patron was married to Angel T. delos Angeles, an insurance consultant.  She is the mother of one offspring, Angelo Ardee.&lt;ref name=Komiks/&gt;

==Education and career==
As an undergraduate, Camp attended the [[University of Michigan]], graduating in 1993 and double majoring in philosophy and English.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt; After graduating, Camp worked as an educational organizer in Chicago, creating and putting into practice programs designed to help residents of public housing study for their [[GED]]'s and programs to provide instruction in [[English as a second language]] to members of Chicago's Latino community.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;  Camp eventually decided to return to school, and received a doctorate in philosophy from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;  As a graduate student, her advisors were [[John Searle]], [[Richard Wollheim]], and John MacFarlane.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;

After receiving her doctorate, Camp spent several years at [[Harvard University]] as part of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]], before moving to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 2006 where she served as an Associate Professor of Philosophy until 2013.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=leiter/&gt; In 2013, Camp accepted a tenured offer from [[Rutgers University]] where she is currently an Associate Professor of Philosophy (and where she is additionally affiliated with the [[Center for Cognitive Studies|Center for Cognitive Science]].)&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;&lt;ref name=leiter&gt;{{cite web|last=Leiter|first=Brian|title=Camp from Penn to Rutgers|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/camp-from-penn-to-rutgers.html|work=Leiter Report|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Brian Leiter]] viewed Camp's move to Rutgers as cementing the reputation of Rutgers' philosophy department as a leader in the fields of [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of language]], and [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref name=leiter/&gt;

Besides her academic appointments, Camp is also active in efforts to encourage the participation of women in academic philosophy.  Along with Elizabeth Harman and Jill North, Camp is one of the organizers behind a series of workshops aimed at providing mentorship to women in graduate philosophy programs; the first workshop is currently intended to be held at [[Princeton University]] in August 2014.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;

==Research areas==
Much of Camp's research has focused on forms of thought and speech that do not fit neatly in to standard propositional models.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  An especial focus of her research has been figurative speech such as sarcasm and metaphor, although she has also worked significantly in other areas, including the effects that loaded language (such as [[racial slur|slurs]]) can have on conversational dynamics, and how conversations are effected when a speaker and a listener are uncertain about whether or not their interests agree.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; Camp has strongly defended the idea of the indispensability of metaphor.&lt;ref name=bja&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=James|title=The Dispensability of Metaphor|journal=The British Journal of Aesthetics|date=July 2010|volume=50|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also written on philosophical issues involving concepts as well as on animal cognition.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;&lt;ref name=oup&gt;{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Kristin|title=Beyond Anthropomorphism: Attributing Psychological Properties to Animals (The Oxford Handbook of Animal Ethics)|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp has also made an effort to counter arguments used against the classical [[Paul Grice|Gricean]] [[implicature]] account of metaphor, making a number of arguments intended to show that [[contextualism|contextualist]] approaches to metaphor are flawed and that it is in fact possible for what is meant by a speaker to differ from what is literally said by a speaker, even in situations where the speaker appears to be quite candid in their speech.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite book|last=Hills|first=David|title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Metaphor|year=2011|publisher=Stanford University|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaphor/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Camp has published a number of peer-reviewed papers in journals such as [[Noûs]], [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]],  [[Philosophical Studies]] and [[Philosophical Quarterly]].&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt; She has also contributed chapters to a number of books, including chapters in ''A Companion to Donald Davidson'' (part of the Blackwell Companions to Philosophy series,) and the forthcoming ''Concepts: New Directions''.&lt;ref name=pbio/&gt;

M. W.|last2=Dixon|date=28 February 2003|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, broadly, the indication of the nature of evidence for a given statement; that is, whether [[evidence]] exists for the statement and if so what kind. An '''evidential''' (also '''verificational''' or '''validational''') is the particular [[grammatical]] element ([[affix]], [[clitic]], or [[Grammatical particle|particle]]) that indicates evidentiality. Languages with only a single evidential have had terms such as '''mediative''', '''médiatif''', '''médiaphorique''', and '''indirective''' used instead of ''evidential''. Evidential is a meaning of nature and statement that is whether evidence exists for the statement and what kind of evidence exists.

==Introduction==

All languages have some means of specifying the source of information. European languages (such as [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Romance languages]]) often indicate evidential-type information through [[modal verb]]s ({{lang-es|deber de}}, {{lang-nl|zouden}}, {{lang-da|skulle}}, {{lang-de|sollen}}) or other [[lexicon|lexical]] words ([[adverbial]]s) ({{lang-en|reportedly}}) or phrases (English: ''it seems to me'').

Some languages have a distinct [[grammatical category]] of evidentiality that is required to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as ''I hear that'', ''I see that'', ''I think that'', ''as I hear'', ''as I can see'', ''as far as I understand'', ''they say'', ''it is said'', ''it seems'', ''it seems to me that'', ''it looks like'', ''it appears that'', ''it turns out that'', ''alleged'', ''stated'', ''allegedly'', ''reportedly'', ''obviously'', etc.

[[Alexandra Aikhenvald]] (2004) reports that about a quarter of the world's languages have some type of grammatical evidentiality. She also reports that, to her knowledge, no research has been conducted on grammatical evidentiality in [[sign language]]s. A first preliminary study on evidentiality in sign language has been conducted by Laura Mazzoni on LIS ([[Italian Sign Language]]).

Many languages with grammatical evidentiality mark evidentiality independently from [[grammatical tense|tense]]-[[grammatical aspect|aspect]] or [[epistemic modality]] (which is the speaker's evaluation of the information, i.e. whether it is reliable, uncertain, probable).

Grammatical evidentiality may be expressed in different forms (depending on the language), such as through [[affix]]es, [[clitic]]s, or [[grammatical particle|particle]]s, like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has inferential evidentials and reportive markers that are realized as suffixes on a variety of (mainly verbal) predicates, and as grammaticalized nouns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198759515.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198759515-e-34&lt;/ref&gt; In another example, [[Eastern Pomo language|Eastern Pomo]] has four evidential [[Affix|suffixes]] that are added to verbs, ''-ink’e'' (nonvisual sensory), ''-ine'' (inferential), ''-·le'' (hearsay), ''-ya'' (direct knowledge).

|}

The use of evidentiality has [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] implications in languages that do not mark evidentiality distinctly from epistemic modality. For example, a person who makes a false statement qualified as a belief may be considered mistaken; a person who makes a false statement qualified as a personally observed fact will probably be considered to have lied.

In some languages, evidential markers also serve other purposes, such as indicating the speaker's attitude to, or belief in, the statement. Usually a direct evidential marker may serve to indicate that the speaker is certain about the event stated. Using an indirect evidential marker, such as one for hearsay or reported information, may indicate that the speaker is uncertain about the statement, or doesn't want to take responsibility for its truth. A "hearsay" evidential may then have the undertone of "that's what they say; whether or not it's true is nothing I can take responsibility for".  In other languages, this is not the case. Therefore one should distinguish between such evidential markers that only mark source of knowledge, and such evidential markers that serve other functions, such as marking epistemic modality.

Evidentials can be used to ‘deflect culpability’&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michael, Lev David. "Nanti evidential practice: language, knowledge, and social action in an Amazonian society." Diss. 2008. Abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; in a statement. In his dissertation on Nanti, a Peruvian Amazonian language, Lev Michael refers to an example in which a young girl is accidentally burned, and a community member questions her mother about how it happened. Her mother uses the evidential marker ‘ka’ which translates to ‘presumably,’ to deflect responsibility for the girl’s mistake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some languages are borderline cases.  For example, French is mostly like English in not having grammatical evidentiality, but does have some ability to express it via inflection.  By using a mood called the conditional (which has three uses: conditions, future-in-the-past, and hearsay), journalistic French frequently makes a distinction between ''Il '''a''' reconnu sa culpabilité'' and ''Il '''aurait''' reconnu sa culpabilité'' (both "He has admitted his guilt"), but with an implication of certainty with the first, and the idea of "reportedly" with the second; the same happens in Spanish: ''Él '''ha''' reconocido su culpa'' vs. ''Él '''habría''' reconocido su culpa''.

==Types according to Aikhenvald==

Following the [[Linguistic typology|typology]] of Aikhenvald (2004, 2006), there are two broad types of evidential marking:

# indirectivity marking ("type I")
# evidential marking ("type II")

The first type (''indirectivity'') indicates whether evidence exists for a given statement, but does not specify what kind of evidence. The second type (''evidentiality proper'') specifies the kind of evidence (such as whether the evidence is visual, reported, or inferred).

===Indirectivity (type I)===

''Indirectivity'' (also known as ''inferentiality'') systems are common in [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Turkic languages]]. These languages indicate whether evidence exists for a given source of information—thus, they contrast ''direct'' information (reported directly) and ''indirect'' information (reported indirectly, focusing on its reception by the speaker/recipient). Unlike the other ''evidential "type II"'' systems, indirectivity marking does not indicate information about the source of knowledge: it is irrelevant whether the information results from hearsay, inference, or perception (however, some Turkic languages distinguish between ''reported indirect'' and ''non-reported indirect'', see Johanson 2003, 2000 for further elaboration). This can be seen in the following [[Turkish language|Turkish]] verbs:

:{|
| gel'''-di'''
| "came"
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| gel'''-miş'''
| "obviously came, came (as far as understood)"
|-
| come-&lt;small&gt;PAST&lt;/small&gt;
|
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| come-&lt;small&gt;INDIRPAST&lt;/small&gt;
|
|}
: &lt;cite&gt;(Johanson 2003: 275)&lt;/cite&gt;

In the first word ''geldi'', the [[markedness|unmarked]] suffix ''-di'' indicates [[past tense]]. In the second word ''gelmiş'', the suffix ''-miş'' also indicates past tense but ''indirectly''. It may be translated into English with the added words ''obviously'', ''apparently'' or ''as far as I understand''. The direct past tense marker ''-di'' is unmarked (or neutral) in the sense that whether or not evidence exists supporting the statement is not specified.

===Evidentiality (type II)===

The other broad type of evidentiality systems ("type II") specifies the nature of the evidence supporting a statement. These kinds of evidence can be divided into such criteria as:

:* Witness vs. nonwitness
:* Firsthand vs. secondhand vs. thirdhand
:* Sensory
:** Visual vs. nonvisual (i.e. auditory, olfactory, etc.)
:* Inferential
:* Reportative
:** Hearsay
:** Quotative
:* Assumed

A ''witness'' evidential indicates that the information source was obtained through direct observation by the speaker. Usually this is from visual observation (''eyewitness''), but some languages also mark information directly heard with information directly seen. A witness evidential is usually contrasted with a ''nonwitness'' evidential which indicates that the information was not witnessed personally but was obtained through a secondhand source or was inferred by the speaker.

A ''secondhand'' evidential is used to mark any information that was not personally observed or experienced by the speaker. This may include inferences or reported information. This type of evidential may be contrasted with an evidential that indicates any other kind of source. A few languages distinguish between secondhand and thirdhand information sources.

''Sensory'' evidentials can often be divided into different types. Some languages mark ''visual'' evidence differently from ''nonvisual'' evidence that is heard, smelled, or felt. The [[Kashaya language]] has a separate ''auditory'' evidential.

An ''inferential'' evidential indicates information was not personally experienced but was inferred from indirect evidence. Some languages have different types of inferential evidentials. Some of the inferentials found indicate:

:# information inferred by direct physical evidence,
:# information inferred by general knowledge,
:# information inferred/assumed because of speaker's experience with similar situations,
:# past deferred realization.

In many cases, different inferential evidentials also indicate epistemic modality, such as uncertainty or probability (see [[Evidentiality#Epistemic modality|epistemic modality]] below). For example, one evidential may indicate that the information is inferred but of uncertain validity, while another indicates that the information is inferred but unlikely to be true.

''Reportative'' evidentials indicate that the information was reported to the speaker by another person. A few languages distinguish between ''hearsay'' evidentials and ''quotative'' evidentials. Hearsay indicates reported information that may or may not be accurate. A quotative indicates the information is accurate and not open to interpretation (i.e., is a direct quotation). An example of a reportative from [[Shipibo language|Shipibo]] (''-ronki''):

: ''Aronkiai.''
: a-'''ronki'''-ai
: do-'''&lt;small&gt;REPRT&lt;/small&gt;'''-&lt;small&gt;INCOMPL&lt;/small&gt;
: "It is said that she will do it." / "She says that she will do it."
: &lt;cite&gt;(Valenzuela 2003:39)&lt;/cite&gt;

====Typology of evidentiality systems====

The following is a brief survey of evidential systems found in the languages of the world as identified in Aikhenvald (2004). Some languages only have two evidential markers while others may have six or more. The system types are organized by the number of evidentials found in the language. For example, a two-term system (''A'') will have two different evidential markers; a three-term system (''B'') will have three different evidentials. The systems are further divided by the type of evidentiality that is indicated (e.g., ''A1'', ''A2'', ''A3'', etc.). Languages that exemplify each type are listed in parentheses.

The most common system found is the A3 type.

Two-term systems:

* A1. witness, nonwitness (e.g., [[Jarawara]], [[Yukaghir languages]], [[Irantxe language|Mỹky]], [[Godoberi language|Godoberi]], [[Kalasha-mun language|Kalasha-mun]], [[Khowar language|Khowar]], [[Yanam language|Yanam]])
* A2. nonfirsthand, everything else (e.g., [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]], [[Khanty language|Khanty]], [[Nenets languages|Nenets]], [[Enets language|Enets]], [[Selkup language|Selkup]], [[Northeast Caucasian languages]])
* A3. reported, everything else (e.g., [[Turkic languages]], [[Enga language|Enga]], [[Tauya]], [[Lezgian language|Lezgian]], [[Kham language|Kham]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Livonian language|Livonian]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], several [[Indigenous languages of the Americas#South America|South American languages]])

Three-term systems:

* B1. visual sensory, inferential, reportative (e.g., [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Shastan languages]], [[Qiang languages]], [[Maidu language|Maidu]], most of [[Quechuan languages]], Northern [[Embera languages]])
* B2. visual sensory, nonvisual sensory, inferential (e.g., [[Washo language|Washo]])
* B3. nonvisual sensory, inferential, reportative (e.g., [[Retuarã]], [[Northern Pomo]])
* B4. witness(direct), nonwitness(indirect), inferential, reportative (e.g., [[Tsezic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://journals.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Journals.woa/1/xmlpage/1/article/393?htmlOnce=yes|title=Evidentiality in Tsezic Languages|author=|date=|website=journals.dartmouth.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dagestanian languages]])

Four-term systems:

* C1. visual sensory, nonvisual sensory, inferential, reportative  (e.g., [[Tariana language|Tariana]], [[Xamatauteri]], [[Eastern Pomo]], East [[Tucanoan languages]])
* C2. visual sensory, inferential #1, inferential #2, reportative (e.g., [[Tsafiki]], [[Pawnee language|Pawnee]], [[Ancash Quechua]])
* C3. nonvisual sensory, inferential #1, inferential #2, reportative (e.g., [[Wintu language|Wintu]])
* C4. visual sensory, inferential, reportative #1, reportative #2 (e.g., [[Southeastern Tepehuan]])
* C5. witness (non-subjective, non-renarrative), inferential (subjective, non-renarrative), renarrative (non-subjective, renarrative), dubitative (subjective, renarrative) (e.g., [[Bulgarian verbs#Evidentials|Bulgarian]])&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidentiality marking and other categories==

Evidential systems in many languages are often marked simultaneously with other linguistic categories. For example, according to Aikhenvald a given language may use the same element to mark both evidentiality and [[mirativity]] (i.e. unexpected information). She claims that this is the case of [[Western Apache]] where the post-verbal particle ''lą̄ą̄'' primarily functions as a mirative but also has a secondary function as an inferential evidential. This phenomenon of evidentials developing secondary functions or of other grammatical elements (e.g. miratives, [[modal verb]]s) developing evidential functions is fairly widespread. The following types of mixed systems have been reported:

:* evidentiality with mirativity
:* evidentiality with [[grammatical tense|tense]]-[[grammatical aspect|aspect]]
:* evidentiality with [[linguistic modality|modality]] &amp;nbsp; ''(this is discussed in the next section below)''

In addition to the interactions with tense, modality, and mirativity, the usage of evidentials in some languages may also depend on the [[clause]] type, [[discourse]] structure, and/or linguistic [[genre]].

However, despite the intersection of evidentiality systems with other [[semantic]] or [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] systems (through grammatical categories), Aikhenvald believes that several languages do mark evidentiality without any grammatical connection to these other semantic/pragmatic systems. More explicitly stated, she believes that there are modal systems which do not express evidentiality and evidential systems which do not express modality. Likewise, there are mirative systems which do not express evidentiality and evidential systems which do not express mirativity.

===Epistemic modality===

Evidentiality is often considered to be a sub-type of [[Epistemology|epistemic]] modality (see, for example, Palmer 1986, Kiefer 1994). Other linguists consider evidentiality (marking the source of information in a statement) to be distinct from epistemic modality (marking the degree of confidence in a statement). An English example:

: '''I see''' that he is coming. (evidential)
: '''I know''' that he is coming. (epistemic)

For instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) states that evidentiality ''asserts'' evidence while epistemic modality ''evaluates'' evidence and that evidentiality is more akin to a [[deictic]] category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way [[demonstrative]]s mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude about the validity of a statement but this is not a required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.

Considering evidentiality as a type of epistemic modality may only be the result of analyzing non-European languages in terms of the systems of modality found in European languages. For example, the modal verbs in Germanic languages are used to indicate both evidentiality and epistemic modality (and are thus ambiguous when taken out of context). Other (non-European) languages clearly mark these differently. De Haan (2001) finds that the use of modal verbs to indicate evidentiality is comparatively rare (based on a sample of 200 languages).

===Terminology===

Although some linguists have proposed that evidentiality should be considered separately from epistemic modality, other linguists conflate the two. Because of this conflation, some researchers use the term ''evidentiality'' to refer both to the marking of the knowledge source and the commitment to the truth of the knowledge.

==In English (not grammaticalized)==

Evidentiality is not considered a grammatical category in English because it is expressed in diverse ways and is always optional.  In contrast, many other languages (including [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]]) require the speaker to mark the main verb or the sentence as a whole for evidentiality, or offer an optional set of affixes for indirect evidentiality, with direct experience being the default assumed mode of evidentiality.

Consider these [[English language|English]] sentences:

: I am hungry.
: Bob is hungry.

We are unlikely to say the second unless someone (perhaps Bob himself) has told us that Bob is hungry. (We might still say it for someone incapable of speaking for himself, such as a baby or a pet.) If we are simply assuming that Bob is hungry based on the way he looks or acts, we are more likely to say something like:

: Bob &lt;u&gt;looks&lt;/u&gt; hungry.
: Bob &lt;u&gt;seems&lt;/u&gt; hungry.
: Bob &lt;u&gt;would be&lt;/u&gt; hungry by now.
: Bob &lt;u&gt;must be&lt;/u&gt; hungry by now.

Here, the fact that we are relying on sensory evidence, rather than direct experience, is conveyed by our use of the word ''look'' or ''seem''.

Another situation in which the evidential modality is expressed in English is in certain kinds of predictions, namely those based on the evidence at hand. Amongst EFL teachers, these are usually referred to as "predictions with evidence". Examples:

: Look at those clouds! It's '''going to''' rain! (Compare "It will rain!").

=== Possible exceptions ===

The suffix "ish" can be considered to be a [[grammaticalized]] marker of uncertainty.

==Western history of the concept==

The notion of evidentiality as obligatory grammatical information was first made apparent in 1911 by [[Franz Boas]] in his introduction to ''The Handbook of American Indian Languages'' in a discussion of [[Kwak'wala|Kwakiutl]] and in his grammatical sketch of [[Tsimshianic]]. The term ''evidential'' was first used in the current linguistic sense by [[Roman Jakobson]] in 1957 in reference to [[Balkan languages|Balkan]] [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (Jacobsen 1986:4; Jakobson 1990) with the following definition:

: "E&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;E&lt;sup&gt;ns&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; evidential is a tentative label for the verbal category which takes into account three events — a narrated event (E&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;), a speech event (E&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;), and a narrated speech event (E&lt;sup&gt;ns&lt;/sup&gt;). The speaker reports an event on the basis of someone else's report (quotative, i.e. hearsay evidence), of a dream (revelative evidence), of a guess (presumptive evidence) or of his own previous experience (memory evidence)."

Jakobson also was the first to clearly separate evidentiality from [[grammatical mood]]. By the middle of the 1960s, ''evidential'' and ''evidentiality'' were established terms in linguistic literature.

Systems of evidentiality have received focused linguistic attention only relatively recently. The first major work to examine evidentiality cross-linguistically is Chafe &amp; Nichols (1986). A more recent [[Linguistic typology|typological]] comparison is Aikhenvald (2004).

A '''ferrule''' (a corruption of [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|viriola}}'' "small bracelet", under the influence of ''{{lang|la|ferrum}}'' "iron") is any of a number of types of objects, generally used for fastening, joining, sealing or reinforcement. They are often narrow circular rings made from metal, or less commonly, plastic. Ferrules are also often referred to as ''eyelets'' or ''[[grommets]]'' within the [[manufacturing industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferrules &amp; Eyelets |url=http://transmatic.com/Capabilities/FerrulesEyelets |publisher=Trans-Matic Manufacturing, Inc. |accessdate=18 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419025256/http://transmatic.com/Capabilities/FerrulesEyelets |archivedate=19 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ferrules consist of a circular [[Clamp (tool)|clamp]] used to hold together and attach [[fiber]]s, [[wire]]s, or posts, generally by crimping, [[swaging]], or otherwise deforming the ferrule to permanently tighten it onto the parts that it holds.

[[File:Syntax tree.svg|thumb|Structure of a syntactically well-formed, although nonsensical, English sentence ([[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously|historical example]] from Chomsky 1957).]]
In [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], and [[linguistics]], a '''formal language''' consists of [[string (computer science)|words]] whose [[symbol (formal)|letters]] are taken from an [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] and are [[well-formed formula|well-formed]] according to a specific set of rules.

The [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] of a formal language consist of symbols, letters, or tokens that concatenate into strings of the language.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{citation|title=Formal Languages and Compilation|series=Texts in Computer Science|first=Stefano Crespi|last=Reghizzi|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781848820500|page=8|quote=An alphabet is a finite set}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each string concatenated from symbols of this alphabet is called a word, and the words that belong to a particular formal language are sometimes called ''well-formed words'' or ''[[well-formed formula]]s''. A formal language is often defined by means of a [[formal grammar]] such as a [[regular grammar]] or [[context-free grammar]], which consists of its [[formation rule]]s.

The field of '''formal language theory''' studies primarily the purely [[syntax|syntactical]] aspects of such languages—that is, their internal structural patterns. Formal language theory sprang out of linguistics, as a way of understanding the syntactic regularities of [[natural language]]s.
In computer science, formal languages are used among others as the basis for defining the grammar of [[programming language]]s and formalized versions of subsets of natural languages in which the words of the language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings or [[semantics]]. In [[computational complexity theory]], [[decision problem]]s are typically defined as formal languages, and [[complexity class]]es are defined as the sets of the formal languages that can be [[parser|parsed by machines]] with limited computational power. In [[logic]] and the [[foundations of mathematics]], formal languages are used to represent the syntax of [[axiomatic system]]s, and [[Formalism (mathematics)|mathematical formalism]] is the philosophy that all of mathematics can be reduced to the syntactic manipulation of formal languages in this way.

== History ==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
The first formal language is thought to be the one used by [[Gottlob Frege]] in his ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'' (1879), literally meaning "concept writing", and which Frege described as a "formal language of pure thought."&lt;ref name="Herken1995"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Rolf Herken|title=The universal Turing machine: a half-century survey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YafIDVd1Z68C&amp;pg=PA290|year=1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82637-9|page=290|chapter=Influences of Mathematical Logic on Computer Science|author=Martin Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Axel Thue]]'s early [[semi-Thue system]], which can be used for rewriting strings, was influential on [[formal grammar]]s.

==Words over an alphabet==

An '''alphabet''', in the context of formal languages, can be any [[set (mathematics)|set]], although it often makes sense to use an [[alphabet]] in the usual sense of the word, or more generally a [[character set]] such as [[ASCII]] or [[Unicode]].  The elements of an alphabet are called its '''letters'''.  An alphabet may contain an [[countable set|infinite]] number of elements;&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[first-order logic]] is often expressed using an alphabet that, besides symbols such as ∧, ¬, ∀ and parentheses, contains infinitely many elements ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;… that play the role of variables.&lt;/ref&gt; however, most definitions in formal language theory specify alphabets with a finite number of elements, and most results apply only to them.

A '''word''' over an alphabet can be any finite sequence (i.e., [[string (computer science)|string]]) of letters. The set of all words over an alphabet Σ is usually denoted by Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (using the [[Kleene star]]). The length of a word is the number of letters it is composed of. For any alphabet, there is only one word of length 0, the ''empty word'', which is often denoted by e, ε, λ or even Λ. By [[concatenation]] one can combine two words to form a new word, whose length is the sum of the lengths of the original words. The result of concatenating a word with the empty word is the original word.

In some applications, especially in [[logic]], the alphabet is also known as the ''vocabulary'' and words are known as ''formulas'' or ''sentences''; this breaks the letter/word metaphor and replaces it by a word/sentence metaphor.

==Definition==
A '''formal language''' ''L'' over an alphabet Σ is a [[subset]] of Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, a set of [[#Words over an alphabet|words]] over that alphabet. Sometimes the sets of words are grouped into expressions, whereas rules and constraints may be formulated for the creation of 'well-formed expressions'.

In computer science and mathematics, which do not usually deal with [[natural language]]s, the adjective "formal" is often omitted as redundant.

While formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules, the actual definition of the concept "formal language" is only as above: a (possibly infinite) set of finite-length strings composed from a given alphabet, no more and no less.  In practice, there are many languages that can be described by rules, such as [[regular language]]s or [[context-free language]]s.  The notion of a [[formal grammar]] may be closer to the intuitive concept of a "language," one described by syntactic rules. By an abuse of the definition, a particular formal language is often thought of as being equipped with a formal grammar that describes it.

==Examples==

The following rules describe a formal language&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} over the alphabet Σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, +, = }:
* Every nonempty string that does not contain "+" or "=" and does not start with "0" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* The string "0" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* A string containing "=" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} if and only if there is exactly one "=", and it separates two valid strings of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* A string containing "+" but not "=" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} if and only if every "+" in the string separates two valid strings of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}.
* No string is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} other than those implied by the previous rules.
Under these rules, the string "23+4=555" is in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}}, but the string "=234=+" is not. This formal language expresses [[natural number]]s, well-formed additions, and well-formed addition equalities, but it expresses only what they look like (their [[syntax]]), not what they mean ([[semantics]]). For instance, nowhere in these rules is there any indication that "0" means the number zero,   "+" means addition, "23+4=555" is false, etc.

=== Constructions ===&lt;!-- [[empty language]] redirects here --&gt;
For finite languages, one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words. For example, we can describe a language&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|L}} as just {{mvar|L}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{"a", "b", "ab", "cba"}. The [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] case of this construction is the '''empty language''', which contains no words at all (&lt;span class="nounderlines"&gt;{{mvar|L}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[∅]]&lt;/span&gt;).

However, even over a finite (non-empty) alphabet such as Σ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{a,&amp;nbsp;b} there are an infinite number of finite-length words that can potentially be expressed: "a", "abb", "ababba", "aaababbbbaab",&amp;nbsp;…. Therefore, formal languages are typically infinite, and describing an infinite formal language is not as simple as writing ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{"a", "b", "ab", "cba"}. Here are some examples of formal languages:
* {{mvar|L}} = Σ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, the set of ''all'' words over Σ;
* {{mvar|L}} = {"a"}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = {"a"&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}, where ''n'' ranges over the natural numbers and "a"&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- I know it is ugly, but it is consistent with the notation in other examples. Should we use through the article, say, angle brackets ‹a›? --&gt; means "a" repeated ''n'' times (this is the set of words consisting only of the symbol "a");
* the set of syntactically correct programs in a given programming language (the syntax of which is usually defined by a [[context-free grammar]]);
* the set of inputs upon which a certain [[Turing machine]] halts; or
* the set of maximal strings of [[alphanumeric]] [[ASCII]] characters on this line, i.e.,&lt;br&gt; the set {"the", "set", "of", "maximal", "strings", "alphanumeric", "ASCII", "characters", "on", "this", "line", "i", "e"}.

== Language-specification formalisms ==

Formal languages are used as tools in multiple disciplines. However, formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages (except as examples), but is mainly concerned with the study of various types of formalisms to describe languages. For instance, a language can be given as
* those strings generated by some [[formal grammar]];
* those strings described or matched by a particular [[regular expression]];
* those strings accepted by some [[Automata theory|automaton]], such as a [[Turing machine]] or [[Finite state machine|finite state automaton]];
* those strings for which some [[decision problem|decision procedure]] (an [[algorithm]] that asks a sequence of related YES/NO questions) produces the answer YES.

Typical questions asked about such formalisms include:

* What is their expressive power? (Can formalism ''X'' describe every language that formalism ''Y'' can describe? Can it describe other languages?)
* What is their recognizability? (How difficult is it to decide whether a given word belongs to a language described by formalism ''X''?)
* What is their comparability? (How difficult is it to decide whether two languages, one described in formalism ''X'' and one in formalism ''Y'', or in ''X'' again, are actually the same language?).

Surprisingly often, the answer to these decision problems is "it cannot be done at all", or "it is extremely expensive" (with a characterization of how expensive). Therefore, formal language theory is a major application area of [[Computability theory (computer science)|computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]. Formal languages may be classified in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] based on the expressive power of their generative grammar as well as the complexity of their recognizing [[automata theory|automaton]]. [[Context-free grammar]]s and [[regular grammar]]s provide a good compromise between expressivity and ease of [[parsing]], and are widely used in practical applications.

== Operations on languages ==

Certain operations on languages are common. This includes the standard set operations, such as union, intersection, and complement. Another class of operation is the element-wise application of string operations.

Examples: suppose ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are languages over some common alphabet.
* The ''[[concatenation]]'' ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all strings of the form ''vw'' where ''v'' is a string from ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''w'' is a string from ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
* The ''intersection'' ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all strings that are contained in both languages
* The ''complement'' ¬''L'' of a language with respect to a given alphabet consists of all strings over the alphabet that are not in the language.
* The [[Kleene star]]: the language consisting of all words that are concatenations of 0 or more words in the original language;
* ''Reversal'':
** Let ''e'' be the empty word, then ''e&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e'', and
** for each non-empty word ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;…''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' over some alphabet, let ''w&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;…''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'',
** then for a formal language ''L'', ''L&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''w&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''w'' ∈ ''L''}.
* [[String homomorphism]]

Such [[string operations]] are used to investigate [[Closure (mathematics)|closure properties]] of classes of languages. A class of languages is closed under a particular operation when the operation, applied to languages in the class, always produces a language in the same class again. For instance, the [[context-free language]]s are known to be closed under union, concatenation, and intersection with [[regular language]]s, but not closed under intersection or complement. The theory of [[cone (formal languages)|trios]] and [[abstract family of languages|abstract families of languages]] studies the most common closure properties of language families in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, Chapter 11: Closure properties of families of languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Programming languages ===
{{Main|Syntax (programming languages)|Compiler compiler}}

A compiler usually has two distinct components. A [[lexical analyzer]], generated by a tool like [[lex programming tool|&lt;code&gt;lex&lt;/code&gt;]], identifies the tokens of the programming language grammar, e.g. [[identifier]]s or [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]], which are themselves expressed in a simpler formal language, usually by means of [[regular expressions]]. At the most basic conceptual level, a [[parser]], usually generated by a [[parser generator]] like &lt;code&gt;[[yacc]]&lt;/code&gt;, attempts to decide if the source program is valid, that is if it belongs to the programming language for which the compiler was built.

Of course, compilers do more than just parse the source code – they usually translate it into some executable format. Because of this, a parser usually outputs more than a yes/no answer, typically an [[abstract syntax tree]]. This is used by subsequent stages of the compiler to eventually generate an [[executable]] containing [[machine code]] that runs directly on the hardware, or some [[intermediate code]] that requires a [[virtual machine]] to execute.

=== Formal theories, systems and proofs ===
[[File:Formal languages.svg|thumb|300px|right|This diagram shows the [[Syntax (logic)|syntactic]] divisions within a [[formal system]]. [[string (computer science)|Strings of symbols]] may be broadly divided into nonsense and [[well-formed formula]]s.  The set of well-formed formulas is divided into [[theorem]]s and non-theorems.]]

{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)|Formal system}}

In [[mathematical logic]], a ''formal theory'' is a set of [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] expressed in a formal language.

A ''formal system'' (also called a ''logical calculus'', or a ''logical system'') consists of a formal language together with a [[deductive apparatus]] (also called a ''deductive system''). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of [[transformation rule]]s, which may be interpreted as valid rules of inference, or a set of [[axiom]]s, or have both. A formal system is used to [[Proof theory|derive]] one expression from one or more other expressions. Although a formal language can be identified with its formulas, a formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems. Two formal systems &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS'}&lt;/math&gt; may have all the same theorems and yet differ in some significant proof-theoretic way (a formula A may be a syntactic consequence of a formula B in one but not another for instance).

A ''formal proof'' or ''derivation'' is a finite sequence of well-formed formulas (which may be interpreted as sentences, or [[proposition]]s) each of which is an axiom or follows from the preceding formulas in the sequence by a [[rule of inference]]. The last sentence in the sequence is a theorem of a formal system. Formal proofs are useful because their theorems can be interpreted as true propositions.

====Interpretations and models====
{{main|Formal semantics (logic)||Interpretation (logic)|Model theory}}

Formal languages are entirely syntactic in nature but may be given [[semantics]] that give meaning to the elements of the language. For instance, in mathematical [[logic]], the set of possible formulas of a particular logic is a formal language, and an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] assigns a meaning to each of the formulas—usually, a [[truth value]].

The study of interpretations of formal languages is called [[Formal semantics (logic)|formal semantics]].  In mathematical logic, this is often done in terms of [[model theory]].  In model theory, the terms that occur in a formula are interpreted as objects within [[Structure (mathematical logic)|mathematical structures]], and fixed compositional interpretation rules determine how the truth value of the formula can be derived from the interpretation of its terms; a ''model'' for a formula is an interpretation of terms such that the formula becomes true.

'''Griffith Wynne Griffith''' (4 February 1883 &amp;ndash; 2 February 1967) was a Welsh [[Presbyterian]] minister, who became one of the leaders of the denomination.  He was also editor of two journals, a member of the committee for a new translation of the Bible into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and a member of the Council and Court of Governors of [[Bangor University|University College, Bangor]].  He also wrote and translated many hymns.

==Life==
Griffith was born on 4 February 1883 in Brynteci, [[Llandyfrydog]], [[Anglesey]], the son of John Griffith (a farmer) and his wife Judith. He worked on the family farm until the age of 18, when he attended a school in [[Menai Bridge]] run by [[Cynffig Davies]] to prepare candidates for ordination.  He was accepted for ordination by the Anglesey Presbytery in 1903.  His education continued at [[Bangor University|University College, Bangor]], where he graduated with a degree in philosophy) and then at the Theological College in Bala, for training in theology.  He also spent some time at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] from 1909.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;  Griffith was ordained in 1911, and served in various locations thereafter: [[Bryn-du]], Anglesey (1910&amp;ndash;1913), [[Liverpool]] (1913&amp;ndash;1923),  [[Porthmadog]] (1923&amp;ndash;1929) and [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] (1929&amp;ndash;1946). He was regarded as an "elegant and powerful preacher."&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;
[[File:Y Goleuad Oct 30 1869.jpg|thumb|280px|Front page of the earliest surviving copy of the Welsh newspaper Y Goleuad; 30 October 1869.]]

As well as his local ministry, Griffith was involved in the work of his denomination at a national level.  In 1952, he was Moderator of the Association in the North, and was Moderator of the General Assembly in 1959. He was involved in the preparation of a Welsh-language "short confession of faith" and book of services, serving as secretary of the committee responsible. Griffith was also part of the committee that worked on a new Welsh translation of the Bible, and was a member of the Council and Court of Governors of University College, Bangor. His writings included ''{{lang|cy| Datblygiad a Datguddiad}}'' (1946, a version of his Davies Lecture of 1942), two novels (''{{lang|cy|Helynt Coed y Gell}}'' (1928) and ''{{lang|cy|Helynt Ynys Gain}}'' (1939)), and a biography of the Welsh teacher and missionary [[Helen Rowlands]] (1961). He also wrote various theological books: ''{{lang|cy|Paul y cenhadwr}}'' (1925), ''{{lang|cy|Rhai o gymeriadau'r Hen Destament}}'' (1927), ''{{lang|cy|Y Groes}}'' (1943), ''The Wonderful Life'' (1941), and ''{{lang|cy|Ffynnon Bethlehem}}'' (1948). He also contributed to ''{{lang|cy|Y Geiriadur Beiblaidd}}'' (1926), and the ''[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]''.  He edited ''{{lang|cy| Y Cyfarwyddwr}}'' from 1929 to 1930, serving as assistant editor from 1931 to 1944.  He was the editor of ''{{lang|cy| Y Goleuad}}'' from 1949 to 1957. Chapters from his autobiography appeared in this journal, and they were collected together as ''{{lang|cy| Cofio'r blynyddoedd}}'' in 1967.

After his retirement, he lived in [[Llanfair Pwllgwyngyll]] with his wife, Grace (née Roberts) whom he had married in 1914. They had two sons and a daughter, one of his sons (Huw Wynne Griffith) becoming a Presbyterian minister in [[Aberystwyth]].  During his retirement, Griffith wrote and translated a number of hymns, some being collected for publication under the title ''{{lang|cy| Odlau'r Efengyl}}'' in 1959. Griffith died in his son's home in Aberystwyth on 2 February 1967 and was buried in the chapel graveyard in [[Dwyran]], Anglesey.&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-GRIF-WYN-1883.html | title= Griffith, Griffith Wynne (1883&amp;ndash;1967), minister (Presb.) and author | last=Roberts | first=Gomer Morgan | work= Welsh Biography Online | publisher=[[National Library of Wales]] | accessdate=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hakan Nesser02.jpg|thumb|Håkan Nesser, Bremen, 2009]]
'''Håkan Nesser''' (born 21 February 1950) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] author and teacher who has written a number of successful novels, mostly but not only [[crime fiction]]. He has won [[Best Swedish Crime Novel Award]] three times, and his novel ''Carambole'' won the prestigious [[Glass Key award]] in 2000. His books have been translated from [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] into more than twenty languages.

==Early life==
Håkan Nesser was born and grew up in [[Kumla]], [[Örebro County]]; he has lived most of his adult life in [[Uppsala]]. His first novel was published in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nesser.se/en/biography&lt;/ref&gt; but he worked as a teacher until 1998 when he became a full-time author. In August 2006, Håkan Nesser and his wife Elke (a psychiatrist)&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6242076.ece The Sunday Times, 2009-05-10]&lt;/ref&gt; moved to [[Greenwich Village]] in New York. A few years later the couple packed their bags and moved to London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookwitch.wordpress.com/2008/08/20/hakan-nesser/ |title=Håkan Nesser}}&lt;/ref&gt; since it was easier for his wife to find work there.&lt;ref name="svd.se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/nyheter/artikel_3094503.svd |title=Med rätt att döda}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in Sweden, Nesser lives on the Gotlandic island of [[Furillen]] in the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Åkesson|first1=Johan|title=Furillen - drömmen om en egen måne|trans-title=Furillen - The dream of having a moon of your own|url=http://www.dn.se/livsstil/reportage/furillen-drommen-om-en-egen-mane/|website=www.dn.se|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=3 August 2009|accessdate=22 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924143741/http://www.dn.se/livsstil/reportage/furillen-drommen-om-en-egen-mane/|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters and themes==
A recurring [[main character]] is called [[Van Veeteren]], a detective in the early novels and later the owner of an antique books shop. These books play out in a fictitious city called [[Maardam]], said to be located in northern Europe in a country which is never named but resembles [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]] and Germany. The names however are mostly [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

With his 2006 crime novel ''Människa utan hund'' ("Human without Dog") Nesser introduced a new main character, Inspector Gunnar Barbarotti, a Swedish police inspector of Italian descent. He has remained the main protagonist in Nesser's crime books since then. Barbarotti is a more upbeat character than Van Veeteren and the books are firmly set in Sweden, although the town of [[Kymlinge]] is fictitious and named after an "abandoned tube station" in Stockholm.

In August 2011 he hinted on his own site that a future book (which became ''The Living and the Dead in Winsford'') would take place in the "county of [[Somerset]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesser.se/rapporter.cfm?reportID=2011_08 Rapporter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020015203/http://www.nesser.se/rapporter.cfm?reportID=2011_08 |date=20 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aemethms.gif|thumb|right|250px|One of the [[pentacle]]s found in the ''Key of Solomon'' manuscripts. This one is identified as "The Great Pentacle" and appears in Bodleian Library Michael MS. 276, a 17th-century Italian manuscript. An equivalent figure also appears in a Latin version, Bodleian Library, Aubrey MS. 24, dated to 1674.
The figure is a variant of the ''[[Sigillum Dei|Sigillum Aemeth]]'' published by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]''
(Rome, 1652–4, pp.&amp;nbsp;479–81).
]]

The '''''Key of Solomon''''' ([[Latin]]: ''Clavicula Salomonis'', [[Hebrew]]: {{lang|he-Latn|Mafteah Shelomoh [מפתח שלמה]}}) is a [[Pseudepigraph|pseudepigraphical]] [[grimoire]] attributed to [[Solomon|King Solomon]]. It probably dates back to the 14th- or 15th-century [[Italian Renaissance]]. It presents a typical example of [[Renaissance magic]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

It is possible that the ''Key of Solomon'' inspired later works, particularly the 17th-century grimoire also known as ''Clavicula Salomonis Regis'', ''[[Lesser Key of Solomon]]'' or ''Lemegeton'', although there are many differences between the books.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Manuscripts and textual history==
Many such [[grimoire]]s attributed to King Solomon were written during the Renaissance, ultimately being influenced by earlier works of [[Jewish]] [[Kabbalah|kabbalists]] and [[Arab]] [[Alchemy|alchemists]].  These, in turn, incorporated aspects of the [[Greco-Roman magic]] of [[Late Antiquity]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Several versions of the ''Key of Solomon'' exist, in various translations, with minor to significant differences. The archetype was probably a [[Latin]] or Italian text dating to the 14th or 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;"there is no ground for attributing the Key of Solomon, in its present form, a higher antiquity than the fourteenth or fifteenth century." Arthur Edward Waite ''The Book of Black Magic'' p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Most surviving manuscripts date from the late 16th, 17th or 18th centuries. 
There is also an early [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscript dating to the 15th century (Harleian MS. 5596) that is closely associated with the text.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
The Greek manuscript is referred to as ''The [[Magical Treatise of Solomon]]'', and was published by Armand Delatte in ''Anecdota Atheniensia'' (Liége, 1927, pp.&amp;nbsp;397–445.)  Its contents are very similar to the ''Clavicula''.

An important Italian manuscript is Bodleian Library Michael MS 276. An early Latin text survives in printed form, dated to ca. 1600 (University of Wisconsin-Madison, Memorial Library, Special Collections). There are a number of later (17th century) Latin manuscripts. One of the oldest existing manuscripts (besides Harleian 5596) is a text in English translation, entitled ''The Clavicle of Solomon, revealed by Ptolomy the Grecian'' and dated to 1572 (Sloane 3847). There are a number of French manuscripts, all dated to the 18th century, with the exception of one dated to 1641 (P1641, ed. Dumas, 1980).

[[Image:Clavicula Salomonis BL Oriental 14759 35a.jpg|right|thumb|240px|a group of pentacles from the Hebrew manuscript (BL Oriental 14759, fol. 35a)]]
A Hebrew text survives in two versions, one kept at the [[British Library]], on a parchment manuscript, separated in BL Oriental MSS 6360 and 14759. The BL manuscript was dated to the 16th century by its first editor  Greenup (1912), but is now thought to be somewhat younger, dating to the 17th or 18th century.&lt;ref name="Rohrbacher"&gt;Rohrbacher-Sticker, Jewish Studies quarterly, Volume 1, 1993/94 No. 3, with a follow-up article in the British Library Journal, Volume 21, 1995, p. 128-136.&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of a second  Hebrew text in the library of Samuel H. Gollancz was published by his son [[Hermann Gollancz]] in 1903, who also published a facsimile edition in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;A more recent facsimile edition of this book, ''Sepher Maphteah Shelomoh'' (Book of the Key of Solomon)(2008), was published by Teitan Press in 2008. Introductions by [[Hermann Gollancz]] and a Foreword by Stephen Skinner.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gollancz' manuscript had been copied in Amsterdam, in [[Sephardic]] cursive script, and is less legible than the BL text.  The Hebrew text is not considered the original. It is rather a late Jewish adaptation of a Latin or Italian ''Clavicula'' text. The BL manuscript is probably the archetype of the Hebrew translation, and Gollancz' manuscript a copy of the BL one.&lt;ref name="Rohrbacher"/&gt;

An edition of the Latin manuscripts of the British Library was published by [[S. L. MacGregor Mathers]] in 1889.
[[L. W. de Laurence]] in 1914 published "The Greater Key of Solomon", directly based on Mathers' edition, to which he made alterations in an attempt to advertise his mail-order business (for example by inserting instructions like  "after burning one-half teaspoonful of Temple Incense" along with ordering information for the incense).

===Summary===
The ''Key of Solomon''  is divided into two books. It describes not the appearance or work of any spirit but only the necessary drawings to prepare each "experiment" or, in more modern language, [[Magic (paranormal)|magical operation]]s.

Unlike later grimoires such as the ''[[Pseudomonarchia Daemonum]]'' (16th century) or the ''[[Lemegeton]]'' (17th century), the ''Key of Solomon'' does not mention the  [[Diabolical signature|signature]] of the  72 spirits constrained by King Solomon in a bronze vessel. As in most medieval grimoires, all magical operations are ostensibly performed through the power of [[God (Christianity)|God]], to whom all the invocations are addressed. Before any of these operations (termed "experiments") are performed, the operator must confess his sins and purge himself of [[evil]], invoking the protection of God.

Elaborate preparations are necessary, and each of the numerous items used in the operator's "experiments" must be constructed of the appropriate materials obtained in the prescribed manner, at the appropriate [[astrology|astrological]] time, marked with a specific set of magical symbols, and blessed with its own specific words. All substances needed for the magic drawings and [[amulet]]s are detailed, as well as the means to purify and prepare them. Many of the symbols incorporate the [[Transitus Fluvii]] occult alphabet.

===Introduction===
According to the mythical history of the document, as recorded in its introduction, Solomon wrote the book for his son [[Rehoboam]], and commanded him to hide the book in his [[sepulchre]] upon his death. After many years the book was discovered by a group of [[Babylonia]]n [[philosophers]] repairing Solomon's tomb. None could interpret the text, until one of them, Iohé Grevis, suggested that they should entreat the Lord for understanding. The Angel of the Lord appeared to him and extracted a promise that he would keep the text hidden from the unworthy and the wicked, after which he was able to read it plainly. Iohé Grevis then placed a conjuration on the book that the unworthy, the unwise or those who did not fear God would not attain the desired effect from any of the workings contained therein.

===Book I===
Book I contains [[Evocation|conjurations]], [[invocation]]s and [[curse]]s to summon and constrain [[spirit]]s of the dead and [[demon]]s in order to compel them to do the operator's will. It also describes how to find stolen items, become invisible, gain favour and love, and so on.

===Book II===
Book II describes various purifications which the operator (termed "exorcist") should undergo, how they should clothe themselves, how the magical implements used in their operations should be constructed, and what [[animal sacrifice]]s should be made to the spirits.

'''Lexical substitution''' is the task of identifying a substitute for a word in the context of a clause. For instance, given the following text: "After the ''match'', replace any remaining fluid deficit to prevent chronic dehydration throughout the tournament", a substitute of ''game'' might be given.

Lexical substitution is strictly related to [[word sense disambiguation]] (WSD), in that both aim to determine the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of a word. However, while WSD consists of automatically assigning the appropriate [[word sense|sense]] from a fixed sense inventory, lexical substitution does not impose any constraint on which substitute to choose as the best representative for the word in context. By not prescribing the inventory, lexical substitution overcomes the issue of the granularity of sense distinctions and provides a level playing field for automatic systems that automatically acquire word senses (a task referred to as [[Word Sense Induction]]).

== Evaluation ==

In order to evaluate automatic systems on lexical substitution, a task was organized at the [http://www.dianamccarthy.co.uk/task10index.html Semeval-2007] evaluation competition held in [[Prague]] in 2007. A [http://lit.csci.unt.edu/index.php/Semeval_2010 Semeval-2010] task on cross-lingual lexical substitution has also taken place.

== Skip-gram model == 
The skip-gram model takes words with similar meanings into a vector space (collection of objects that can be added together and multiplied by numbers) that are found close to each other in N-dimensions (list of items). A variety of [[neural network]]s (computer system modeled after a human brain) are formed together as a result of the vectors and networks that are related together. This all occurs in the dimensions of the vocabulary that has been generated in a network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barazza|first1=Leonardo|title=How does Word2Vec’s Skip-Gram work?|url=https://becominghuman.ai/how-does-word2vecs-skip-gram-work-f92e0525def4|website=Becoming Human}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The model has been used in lexical substitution automation and prediction algorithms. One such algorithm developed by Oren Melamud, Omer Levy, and Ido Dagan uses the skip-gram model to find a vector for each word and its synonyms. Then, it calculates the cosine distance between vectors to determine which words will be the best substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melamud|first1=Oren|last2=Levy|first2=Omer|last3=Dagan|first3=Ido|title=A Simple Word Embedding Model for Lexical Substitution|journal=Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 201|date=5 June 2015|pages=1-7|url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-1501|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Example === 
In a sentence like "The dog walked at a quick pace" each word has a specific vector in relation to the other. The vector for "The" would be [1,0,0,0,0,0,0] because the 1 is the word vocabulary and the 0s are the words surrounding that vocabulary, which create a vector.

'''Tibetan grammar''' describes the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]] and other [[grammar|grammatical features]] of [[Standard Tibetan]], a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language. Standard Tibetan is [[linguistic typology|typologically]] an [[ergative–absolutive language]]. [[Noun]]s are generally unmarked for [[grammatical number]], but are marked for [[grammatical cases|case]]. [[Adjective]]s are never marked and appear after the noun. Demonstratives also come after the noun but these are marked for number. [[Verb]]s are possibly the most complicated part of Tibetan grammar in terms of morphology. The [[dialect]] described here is the colloquial language of [[Central Tibet]], especially [[Lhasa]] and the surrounding area, but the spelling used reflects classical Tibetan, not the colloquial pronunciation.

== Nouns and case==
Nouns are not usually marked for [[grammatical gender]] or [[Grammatical number|number]].

Natural gender may be conveyed through the lexicon, e.g. གཡག་ &lt;gyag&gt; "yak (male)," འབྲི་ &lt;'bri&gt; "yak-cow." In human or animate nouns, gender may be indicated through suffixes. These suffixes are generally པ་ &lt;pa&gt; or པོ་ &lt;po&gt; "male," and མ་ &lt;ma&gt; or མོ་ &lt;mo&gt; "female." 
:{{Unbulleted list
|ཁམས་'''པ'''་ &lt;khams-'''pa'''&gt; "man from Kham," → ཁམས་'''མོ'''་ &lt;khams-'''mo'''&gt; "woman from Kham" |མཛོ་ &lt;mdzo&gt; "yak-cow hybrid," → མཛོ་'''མོ'''་ &lt;mdzo-'''mo'''&gt; "female dzo"
}}

Number is never marked in inanimate nouns or animals. Even human nouns can only take the plural marker ཚོ་ &lt;tsho&gt; if they are specified or definite, e.g. ཨ་མ་ &lt;a-ma&gt; "mother" → ཨ་མ་ཚོ་ &lt;a-ma-'''tsho'''&gt; "(the) mothers." Tibetan does not mark [[definiteness]], and such a meaning would be left to be deduced from the context.

Tibetan nouns are marked for six cases: [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|agentive]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Ablative case|ablative]], [[Comitative case|associative]] and [[Oblique case|oblique]]. Particles are attached to entire noun phrases, not to individual nouns. Case suffixes are attached to the noun phrase as a whole, while the actual noun remains unchanged. The form taken by the suffix depends on the final sound of the noun to which the suffix is attached.

===Absolutive case===
The [[absolutive case]] is the unmarked form of the noun, which may be used as the subject of an [[intransitive verb]], the object of a [[transitive verb]] or the experiencer of an emotion.

===Genitive case===
The [[genitive case]] marks possession and is often translated as "of." The form of the genitive suffix depends on the last sound of the noun:

* if the last sound is a vowel or འ་ &lt;'a&gt; then the suffix is འི་ &lt;'i&gt;
* if the last sound is ག་ &lt;-g&gt; or ང་ &lt;-ng&gt; then the suffix is གི་ &lt;gi&gt;
* if the last sound is ད་ &lt;-d&gt;, བ་ &lt;-b&gt;, ས་ &lt;-s&gt; or one of the secondary sound suffixes then the genitive suffix is ཀྱི་ &lt;kyi&gt;
* if the last sound is ན་ &lt;-n&gt;, མ་ &lt;-m&gt;, ར་ &lt;-r&gt; or ལ་ &lt;-l&gt; then the suffix is གྱི་ &lt;gyi&gt;.

:Wheel '''of''' dharma

:ཆོས་'''ཀྱི་'''འཁོར་ལོ 
:&lt;chos-'''kyi''' 'khor-lo&gt;

:Skin '''of''' sheep

:ལུག་'''གི་'''པགས་པ
:&lt;lug-'''gi''' pags-pa&gt;

The genitive is also used to form [[relative clause]]s. Here, the genitive suffix is attached to the verb and is translated as "that" or "who."
:{| style="text-align: center"
| དེབ་ ||ནང་ལ་ ||ཡོད་'''པའི'''་ || པར་
|-
|&lt;deb || nang-la || yod-'''pai''' || bar&gt;
|-
|book || inside&lt;small&gt;-OBL.&lt;/small&gt; || is&lt;small&gt;-'''GEN.'''&lt;/small&gt; || photo
|-
|colspan="4" align="center"|"the photo that is in the book"
|}

===Agentive case===
Formally the [[Ergative case|agentive (or ergative) case]] is built upon the genitive by adding ས་ &lt;-s&gt; to the latter; consequently:

* if the last sound is a vowel or འ་ &lt;'a&gt; then the suffix is ས་ &lt;-s&gt;
* if the last sound is ག་ &lt;-g&gt; or ང་ &lt;-ng&gt; then the suffix is གིས་ &lt;gis&gt;
* if the last sound is ད་ &lt;-d&gt;, བ་ &lt;-b&gt;, ས་ &lt;-s&gt; or one of the secondary sound suffixes then the genitive suffix is ཀྱིས་ &lt;kyis&gt;
* if the last sound is ན་ &lt;-n&gt;, མ་ &lt;-m&gt;, ར་ &lt;-r&gt; or ལ་ &lt;-l&gt; then the suffix is གྱིས་ &lt;gyis&gt;.

The agentive is used for ergative and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] functions. The ergative function occurs with the subject, agent or causer of transitive verbs, the agent of "mental" and "verbal" actions and the perceiver of a sensation.

===Ablative case===
The [[ablative case]] is always suffixed with ནས་ &lt;nas&gt;. It marks direction away from the noun. Like the agentive case, the ablative can also take the ergative role marking the agent of an action.

===Associative case===
The [[Comitative case|associative case]] is marked by the suffix དང་ &lt;dang&gt;, which may be translated as "and" but also as "with," "against" or have no translation at all.  When speaking, after the associative suffix is used, a pause is inserted, for example:

:{| style="text-align: center"
|པཱ་ལགས་'''དང'''་། || ཨ་ཁུ་'''དང'''་། || ཨ་ནེ། 
|-
|&lt;paa-lags-'''dang''', || a-khu-'''dang''', || a-ne&gt;
|-
| father&lt;small&gt;-'''ASS.'''&lt;/small&gt; || uncle&lt;small&gt;-'''ASS.'''&lt;/small&gt; || aunt
|-
|colspan="3"|"father and uncle and aunt..."
|}

The associative suffix cannot combine with other case or plural markers on the same noun or noun phrase:

:{| style="text-align: center"
|ཨ་མ་'''དང'''་ || སྤུ་གུ་ཚོ། 
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|བུ་'''དང'''་ || བུ་མོ་ཚོར་ || ལག་རྟགས་ || སྦྲུས་པ་ཡོད། 
|-
|&lt;a-ma-'''dang''' || sbu-gu-tsho&gt; 
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|&lt;bu-'''dang''' || bu-mo-'''tsho-r''' || lag-rtags || sbrus-pa-yod&gt;
|-
|mother&lt;small&gt;-'''ASS.'''&lt;/small&gt; || children
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|boy&lt;small&gt;-'''ASS.'''&lt;/small&gt; || boy-&lt;small&gt;FEM&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;-'''PLUR.-DAT.'''&lt;/small&gt; || present || give&lt;small&gt;-PAST-&lt;/small&gt;be&lt;small&gt;:EX.-EGO&lt;/small&gt;
|-
|colspan="2"|"mother and children"
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan="4"|"(they) gave presents to the boys and girls"
|}

===Oblique case===
The [[Oblique case|oblique]] suffix fulfills the functions of both the [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Locative case|locative]] cases. The dative case marks the indirect object of an action and can be translated as "to." The locative case marks place, with or without movement, or time, and can be translated as "on," "in," "at" or "to."

There are two varieties of the suffix, one of which is dependent on the final sound of the noun and one that is not. The form –ར་ &lt;-r&gt; is found only after vowels and འ་ &lt;'a&gt; whereas –ལ་ &lt;-la&gt; can be found after all sounds including vowels and &lt;'a&gt;. The &lt;-r&gt; form is rarely used to mark the dative with monosyllabic words except the personal pronouns and demonstrative and interrogative adjectives.

== Pronouns ==

===Personal pronouns===
[[Pronoun]]s have between one and three registers and three numbers: singular, dual and plural.

{| class="wikitable"
|-

| མོ་(རང་)གཉིས་ &lt;mo-(rang)-gnyis&gt;
| མོ་(རང་)ཚོ་ &lt;mo-(rang)-tsho&gt;
|}

===Demonstrative pronouns===
Tibetan has proximal, medial and distal [[demonstrative pronoun]]s: proximal འདི་ &lt;'di&gt; "this," medial དེ་ &lt;de&gt; "that," and distal ཕ་གི་ &lt;pha-gi&gt; "that over there." འདི་ &lt;'di&gt; and དེ་ &lt;de&gt; also have temporal meanings where འདི་ &lt;'di&gt; is connected with present and དེ་ &lt;de&gt; is connected with the past or the future:
:{{Unbulleted list
|ལོ་'''འདི'''་ &lt;lo ''''di'''&gt; "this year (present time reference)" |ལོ་'''དེ'''་ &lt;lo '''de'''&gt; "that year (past ''or'' future reference)"
}}

ཕ་གི་ &lt;pha-gi&gt;, on the other hand, can only express spatial distance. From these demonstrative pronouns the following adverbs are derived: འདིར་ &lt;'dir&gt; "here," དེར་ &lt;der&gt; "there," and ཕ་གིར་ &lt;pha-gir&gt; "over there."

The demonstratives can be used as both pronouns and adjectives. As pronouns they act much in the same way as the third person pronouns do, but may also refer to previous clauses or events. As adjectives they appear after the noun and act as any other adjective would. Both adjectival and pronominal demonstratives are capable of receiving both case and number suffixes.

== Verb classes ==

===Volitional and non-volitional classes===
There is an important division of verbs into two main classes: [[Volition (linguistics)|volitional and non-volitional]]. The former concerns controllable actions, and the latter non-controllable actions. This difference is comparable to that in English between ''look'' and ''see'', and between ''listen'' and ''hear'': ''listen'' and ''look'' are volitional because you can choose to do them or not, while ''see'' and ''hear'' are non-volitional because they do not denote deliberate actions. These two classes are important when conjugating any Tibetan verb because each class can only use a certain set of suffixes. This means that volitional verbs cannot use the same suffixes as non-volitional verbs and vice versa. For example, the verb form མཐོང་པ་ཡིན་ &lt;mthong-pa-yin&gt; would be incorrect as &lt;mthong&gt; is a non-volitional verb and &lt;pa-yin&gt; is a volitional suffix. The correct form would be མཐོང་པ་རེད་ &lt;mthong-pa-red&gt; or "I saw."

===Transitive and intransitive verbs===
Both the volitional and non-volitional classes contain [[Transitive verb|transitive]] as well as [[intransitive verb]]s. The forms of transitive and intransitive verbs remain the same if the two verbs share the same root. The difference between transitive and intransitive is only evident in the way each verb is used: if the verb takes an object then it is transitive, if it does not then it is intransitive. This distinction determines which case the nouns will take.

===Verb inflection===
Verbs in modern spoken Tibetan have between one and three [[Word stem|stems]]. These are the present-future stem, the past stem and the imperative stem. Many verbs, however, only have one stem when spoken, remaining distinct only in writing, meaning that inflection is based mainly on the use of verbal auxiliaries. The verb is inflected by means of attaching suffixes to the verb stem in a similar way to nouns and pronouns.

== Copulas ==
Tibetan has several verbs that can be translated as "to be" or "to have" which appear in two classes. [[copula (linguistics)|Copula]]s in the first class are essential, meaning that they denote an essential quality of the noun. Copulas in the second class are existential, meaning that they express the existence of a phenomenon or a characteristic and suggests an evaluation by the speaker. The difference between essential and existential copulas is similar to that of the verbs ''estar'' and ''ser'' in the [[Spanish language]].

=== Essential copulas ===

There are three essential copulas: ''assertive'' རེད་ &lt;red&gt;, ''revelatory'' རེད་བཞག་ &lt;red-bzhag&gt;, and ''egophoric'' ཡིན་ &lt;yin&gt;

====Essential-assertive copula====

རེད་ &lt;red&gt; is the "assertive" essential copula. It translates as "to be" and represents an objective assertion or affirmation regarding the subject of the sentence. The negative of རེད་ &lt;red&gt; is མ་རེད་ &lt;ma-red&gt;. The attribute may be an adjective, giving an attributive meaning, or a substantive, giving an equative meaning. The attributive immediately precedes the verb.

|-
|colspan=3|"This is Thubtän."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan=3|"He isn't a nomad."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan=3|"She’s pretty."
|}

This copula, in rare cases, may also express possession of a quality:

:{| style="text-align: center"
|མོ་རང་ || མིག་ || ཆུང་ཆུང་ || '''རེད'''། 
|-
|&lt;mo-rang || mig || chung-chung || '''red'''&gt; 
|-
| she || eye || small || '''be&lt;small&gt;:ESS.-ASSERT.&lt;/small&gt;'''
|-
|colspan="4"|"She has small eyes."
|}

====Essential-revelatory copula====

རེད་བཞག་ &lt;red-bzhag&gt; is the "revelatory" copula, meaning that the speaker has only recently become aware of what they are stating. It may be translated as "to be" with the statement preceded by an exclamation such as "Hey!" or "Why!" Its negative form is རེད་མི་འདུག་ &lt;red-mi-'dug&gt;.

:{| style="text-align: center"

|colspan="2"|"No, he isn’t a nomad."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan="2"|"Why, he’s mad! (I’ve just realized)"
|}

====Essential-egophoric copula====

ཡིན་ &lt;yin&gt; is the "egophoric" essential copula. It is usually translated as "I am" because of its main use with the first person. Like རེད་ &lt;red&gt;, it can be used with adjectives or substantives. Its negative form is མིན་ &lt;min&gt;.

:{| style="text-align: center"
|ང་ || འབྲོག་པ་ || '''ཡིན'''།
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|ང་ || བདེ་པོ་ || '''ཡིན'''།

|-
| I || nomad || '''be&lt;small&gt;:ESS.-EGO.&lt;/small&gt;''' 
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
| I || fine || '''be&lt;small&gt;:ESS.-EGO.&lt;/small&gt;''' 
|-
|colspan="3"|"I am a nomad."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan="3"|"I am fine." 
|}

ཡིན་ &lt;yin&gt; may, on rare occasions, express an intention or an insistence on the part of the speaker:

:{| style="text-align: center"
|ཁྱེད་རང་གི་ || ཇ་ || '''ཡིན'''། 
|-
|&lt;khyed-rang-gi || ja || '''yin'''&gt;
|-

|-
|colspan="3"|"It’s your tea (that I’m intending to give you)."
|}

=== Existential copulas ===
There are three existential copulas: ''assertive''  ཡོད་རེད་ &lt;yod-red&gt;, ''testimonial'' འདུག་ &lt;'dug&gt; and ''egophoric'' ཡོད་ &lt;yod&gt;.

==== Existential-assertive copula ====
ཡོད་རེད་ &lt;yod-red&gt; is the "assertive" copula. This copula is used with the second and third person pronouns and implies a definite assertion by the speaker. It can usually be translated three ways according to context; "there is/are," giving an existential sense, "to be at," giving a certain location (situational sense) or by the verb "to have," giving a possessive sense. Its negative form is ཡོད་མ་རེད་ &lt;yod-ma-red&gt;.

:{| style="text-align: center"

| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
| Tsering&lt;small&gt;-OBL.&lt;/small&gt; || car || '''be&lt;small&gt;:EX.-ASSERT.&lt;/small&gt;''' 
|-
|colspan="3"|"There are airplanes in Tibet."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan="4"|"Thubtän is here."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan="3"|"Tsering has a car."
|}

It can also be preceded by a qualifying adjective to form the attributive sense in which it can be translated as "to be."

:{| style="text-align: center"
|འདི་ || སྙིང་རྗེ་པོ་ || '''ཡོད་རེད'''། 
|-
|&lt;'di || snying-rje-po || '''yod-red'''&gt; 
|-
| this || pretty || '''be&lt;small&gt;:EX.-ASSERT.&lt;/small&gt;''' 
|-
|colspan="3"|"This is pretty."
|}

==== Existential-testimonial copula ====
འདུག་  &lt;'dug&gt; is the "testimonial" copula. It is translated in the same way as ཡོད་རེད་ &lt;yod-red&gt; in all cases but it differs in a subtle way. It implies that the speaker was a witness to what is being stated. Its negative form is མི་འདུག་ &lt;mi-'dug&gt;.

:{| style="text-align: center"
|བོད་ལ་ || གནམ་གྲུ་ || '''འདུག'''་ 
|-
|&lt;bod-la || gnam-gru || ''''dug'''&gt; 
|-

|-
|colspan="3"|"There are airplanes in Tibet. (I know because I have seen them)"
|}

It can also, like ཡོད་རེད &lt;yod-red&gt; be preceded by a qualifying adjective to form the attributive sense in which it can be translated as "to be."

:{| style="text-align: center"
|འདི་ || སྙིང་རྗེ་པོ་ || '''འདུག'''་ 
|-
|&lt;'di || snying-rje-po || ''''dug'''&gt;
|-
| this || pretty || '''be&lt;small&gt;:EX.-TEST.&lt;/small&gt;''' 
|-
|colspan="3"|"This is pretty. (I know because I have seen this for myself)"
|}

==== Existential-egophoric copula ====
ཡོད &lt;yod&gt; is the "egophoric" copula. Like ཡིན་ &lt;yin&gt; it is associated with the first person but it instead marks possession (I have) and location (I am (at)). It may also be used to express the speaker's opinion of something or an acquaintance with something. Its negative form is མེད་ &lt;med&gt;.

:{| style="text-align: center"
|དེབ་ || མང་པོ་ || '''ཡོད'''།

|-
|colspan="3"|"I have many books."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan="2"|"I am in China."
| width="50" |&amp;nbsp;
|colspan="4"|"This tea is good (in my opinion)."

The '''Moru–Madi languages''' of the [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic language family]] are a cluster of closely related languages spoken in [[South Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], and [[Uganda]]. Moru is spoken by 100,000 people, and Ma'di by twice that number. The most populous languages are [[Aringa language|Aringa]] of Uganda, with close to a million speakers, and [[Lugbara language|Lugbara]], with 1.6 million.

== The Language and the People ==
The languages in this cluster are found across three countries: [[Uganda]] ([[Madi language (Sudan and Uganda)|Ma'di]], [[Lugbara language|Lugbara]]); [[South Sudan]] (Lugbara, Ma'di, [[Lolu'bo]], [[Avukaya]], [[Kaliko]], [[Moru language|Moru]] and [[Logo language|Logo]]); and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (Lugbara, Avukaya, Kaliko and Logo).

== The name 'Madi' ==
The name ''Ma'di'' is used for various peoples in the region. There is tendency especially in the Acholi region of northern Uganda to refer to anyone from West Nile Region as a Ma'di, even the Kakwa. The only group in this region who are never called Ma'di are the Alur.

[[Joseph Pasquale Crazzolara]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Pasquale Crazzolara|Crazzolara, J. P.]] (2017). ''A study of the Logbara (Ma'di) language: Grammar and vocabulary''. Routledge. [Originally published 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, states that ''all [[Lugbara people|Logbara]] [...] agree that they are of the Ma'di nation, that they are Ma'di. They are called Ma'di by the Alur of Okooro, their immediate neighbours, in Bunyoro and Buganda.'' Similarly, the linguist [[Archibald Tucker|A. N. Tucker]] described the neighboring [[Keliko people]] who occupy the high plateau near the Logbara, as having the "real name Ma'di".&lt;ref&gt;The Eastern Sudanic Languages. By A. N. Tucker. vol. I. 434 pp. Oxford University Press, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Keliko regard themselves as Keliko rather than as Ma'di.

The '''Natural Language Toolkit''', or more commonly '''NLTK''', is a suite of [[Library (computer science)|libraries]] and programs for symbolic and statistical [[natural language processing]] (NLP) for English written in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]]. It was developed by Steven Bird and Edward Loper in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nltk.org/book/ch00.html|title=Preface|website=www.nltk.org|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; NLTK includes graphical demonstrations and sample data. It is accompanied by a book that explains the underlying concepts behind the language processing tasks supported by the toolkit,&lt;ref name=Bird-Klein-Loper/&gt; plus a cookbook.&lt;ref name=Perkins/&gt;

NLTK is intended to support research and teaching in [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] or closely related areas, including empirical [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[information retrieval]], and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=Bird-Klein-Loper-Baldridge/&gt;
NLTK has been used successfully as a teaching tool, as an individual study tool, and as a platform for prototyping and building research systems. There are 32 universities in the US and 25 countries using NLTK in their courses. NLTK supports classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning functionalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eYubSwLkpB7ZgfQVxxAwgsmAqS__BRfbMyP9qV6ngD8/edit|title=NLTK Courses|website=Google Docs|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Khmer''', also called '''Khmer Surin''' ({{lang-km|ខ្មែរសុរិន្ទ}} - ''Khmer Soren''), is the dialect of the [[Khmer language]] spoken by  approximately 1.4 million [[Khmer people|Khmer]] native to the [[Thailand|Thai]] provinces of [[Surin Province|Surin]], [[Sisaket Province|Sisaket]], [[Buriram Province|Buriram]] and [[Roi Et Province|Roi Et]] as well as those that have migrated from this region into [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name=Vowels&gt;Thomas, David &amp; Wanna, Tienmee; 1984; ''An Acoustic Study of Northern Khmer Vowels''; Mon-Khmer Studies, vol 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

Northern Khmer differs from the [[standard language]], based on a dialect of Central Khmer, in the number and variety of vowel [[phoneme]]s, consonantal distribution, lexicon, grammar, and, most notably, pronunciation of syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}}, giving Northern Khmer a distinct accent easily recognizable by speakers of other dialects.  Some speakers of Northern Khmer may understand other varieties of Khmer but speakers of standard Khmer who have not been exposed to Northern Khmer often have trouble understanding Northern Khmer at first. The two varieties are 80–85% cognate on a basic 270-word list.&lt;ref name=Vowels/&gt; These facts have led some linguists to advocate considering Northern Khmer a separate, but closely related language.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Thomas, David. 1990. "On the 'language' status of Northern Khmer." ''JLC'' 9.1:98–106&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Map-of-southeast-asia 1400 CE.png|thumb|right|'''[[Mandala (Southeast Asian history)|Mandalas]]&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;Influence,&amp;nbsp;1400&amp;nbsp;CE''' &lt;br&gt; Teal: [[Lan Xang]] &lt;br&gt; Purple: [[Lanna]] &lt;br&gt; Orange: [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] &lt;br&gt; Blue Violet: [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]] &lt;br&gt; Red: [[Khmer Empire]] &lt;br&gt;Yellow: [[Champa]] &lt;br&gt; Blue: [[Dai Viet]]]]

After the fall of the [[Khmer Empire]] in the early 15th century the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border, leaving the Khmer north of the mountains increasingly under the sphere of influence of [[Lan Xang]]. The conquests of Cambodia by [[Naresuan|Naresuan the Great]] for [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] furthered the political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper, leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the [[Middle Khmer]] period.&lt;ref name=Bernon&gt;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bernon1988khmer.pdf de Bernon, Olivier. "Khmer of Surin: Lexical Remarks". 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Isan area was claimed by the Lao [[Kingdom of Champasak]] in 1718 and in 1893, the region became part of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (Thailand) as a result of the [[Franco-Siamese War]]. Throughout this period, the Northern Khmer people shared the rural mountainous highlands with the Lao, Thai and various Mon-Khmer groups such as the [[Kuy]], leading to a high degree of multilingualism.&lt;ref name="sm"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smalley | first = William A. | author-link = William A. Smalley | date = 1988 | title = Multilingualism in the Northern Khmer Population of Thailand | journal = Language Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 395&amp;ndash;408 | doi = 10.1016/0388-0001(88)90023-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; These varied influences and unique history have resulted in a distinct accent, with characteristics of the surrounding tonal languages, lexical differences through borrowing from Lao, Kuy and Thai, and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants.

==Phonology==
Northern Khmer has the typical Mon-Khmer consonant and syllable structure although there is no phonemic [[phonation]].&lt;ref name=Vowels/&gt;  The primary divergences from Central Khmer phonology are in the realizations of some syllable-final consonants and in the vowel inventory.&lt;ref name=Vowels/&gt; Northern Khmer is also losing the sesquisyllabic pattern of its sister languages.&lt;ref name=prakorb&gt;Phon-ngam, Prakorb; 1992; [https://sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/22:252-256.pdf  The Problem of Aspirates in Central Khmer and Northern Khmer]&lt;/ref&gt; Many dysllables have lost all but the first consonant of the [[minor syllable|pre-syllable]], creating a great number of consonant clusters.  In many dialects of Northern Khmer, however, inserting a generic syllable, {{IPA|/-rɔ-/}}, after an initial consonant is still optional, returning some words to their original sesquisyllabic structure.&lt;ref name=prakorb/&gt;

===Consonants===
The consonant inventory of Northern Khmer is identical to that of Central Khmer. It is laid out below as reported by Thomas.&lt;ref name=TD&gt;Thomas, Dorothy; ''Popularizing the Northern Khmer Orthography:  Sociolinguistics in Action'' Workshop in Northern Khmer Orthography, Surin; Mon-Khmer Studies Journal. 16–17: 255–265&lt;/ref&gt;

Syllable-initial consonants are pronounced as in Central Khmer.  When appearing as a syllable-final, however, the {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ʔ/}} and {{IPA|ŋ}} that would be expected in Central Khmer are often realized as {{IPA|/c/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}}, respectively, in Northern Khmer. Additionally, as mentioned above, syllable-final {{IPA|/r/}} which has become silent in all other dialects is markedly pronounced.&lt;ref name=TD/&gt;

===Vowels===
{{Khmer language}}
The biggest distinction between Northern Khmer of Thailand and Central Khmer of Cambodia is in the inventory of vowel phonemes. [[William A. Smalley|Smalley]] described 14 pure vowels that occur both long and short.&lt;ref name=Smalley&gt;Smalley, William A.; 1976; The Problem of Vowels: Northern Khmer; Canberra; Pacific Linguistics C-43; pp 25–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William A. Smalley|Smalley]] also described three "vowels with offglides" that he treated as monophthongs, namely {{IPA|/iə/}}, {{IPA|/ɨə/}} and {{IPA|/uə/}}, for a total of 17 vowel phonemes.&lt;ref name=Vowels/&gt; All 17 vowels may occur in closed syllables and all but {{IPA|ɨə}} have been found in open syllables. With 14 basic vowel positions, and having more back vowels than front, Northern Khmer is atypical.  By contrast, standard Central Khmer only has 9 or 10 basic vowel positions, depending on the analysis.&lt;ref name="HUFF"&gt;Huffman, Franklin. 1970. ''[http://www.pratyeka.org/csw/hlp-csw.pdf Cambodian System of Writing and Beginning Reader]''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-01314-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Accoustic&gt;Wayland, Ratree. [http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/wayland1998acoustic.pdf "An Acoustic Study of Battambang Khmer Vowels."] The Mon-Khmer Studies Journal. 28. (1998): 43–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Script==
Northern Khmer is, for the most part, a spoken language as most speakers are unable to read or write their native tongue&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/khmer-english/news/Khmer-Surin-Get-Support-From-US-Group-112378059.html|title=VOA Khmer News, Radio, TV|author=|date=|website=voanews.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[Thaification]] policies either enacted or supported by the Thai government.  However, recent renewed interest and enthusiasm in Khmer language and culture has resulted in a two-fold increase in the use of Northern Khmer since 1958 and the consequential need for a formalized method of writing the language.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt; Since the Thai language is the medium of public education and, until the 21st century, the media, Khmer is taught at home or by monks in the local Khmer temples, often supported by Khmers in Cambodia or Western nations.&lt;ref name=voa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Choosri&gt;Isara, Choosri; 2008; [http://www.lc.mahidol.ac.th/th/documents/02-Research/04-Present/2008i-Isara-Use.pdf THE USE OF NORTHERN KHMER IN COMMUNITY RADIO PROGRAMS IN THAILAND]; Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, Northern Khmer is written in the [[Thai alphabet|Thai script]].&lt;ref name=TD/&gt; As many sounds occur in Northern Khmer that would be impossible to write according to the rules of Thai orthography, a few innovations are necessary such as using ฮ (initial /h/ in Thai) at the end of words to represent syllable-final /h/ and ญ (initial {{IPA|/j/}}, final {{IPA|/n/}} in Thai) to represent Northern Khmer's palatal nasal /ɲ/.  Special diacritics are also sometimes used with the vowels because Northern Khmer has more vowel positions than Thai.&lt;ref name=TD/&gt;

Within Cambodia, Northern Khmer is written in the Khmer script as the words are spelled in standard Khmer, regardless of the Northern Khmer pronunciation. This is seen most often in the context of [[kantrum]] music [[karaoke]] DVDs which are increasingly popular in Cambodia and with Cambodians overseas.

" ฺ " (the [[Virama|pinthu]] mark) or " ํ " are used to alter the pronunciation of vowels, similar to the ''bântăk'' punctuation mark (a small vertical line on the final consonant of a syllable) in the [[Khmer alphabet]].

{{nihongo|'''Old Japanese'''|上代日本語|Jōdai Nihon-go}} is the oldest attested stage of the [[Japanese language]]. It is attested in documents from the [[Nara period]] (8th century). It evolved into [[Early Middle Japanese]] in the succeeding [[Heian period]], although the precise separation of these two languages is controversial. Old Japanese was an early member of the [[Japonic languages|Japonic]] family; no conclusive links to other language families have been demonstrated.

Old Japanese was written using [[Chinese characters]], using an increasingly standardized and phonetic form that eventually evolved into ''[[man'yōgana]]''. Typically for a Japonic language and for a step in the evolutionary line of modern Japanese, Old Japanese was a primarily [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] language with [[subject–object–verb]] word ordering. However, the language was marked by a few phonemic differences from later forms of Japanese, such as a simpler syllable structure and distinctions between several pairs of syllables pronounced identically in Early Middle Japanese and later.  The phonetic realization of this differentiation is uncertain.

Linguistic changes are gradual, and the periodization of Japanese is "both delicate and controversial", with multiple competing methods and criteria for division. For both practical and conventional reasons, these divisions often correlate to political events, particularly shifts in power or changes of capital.{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=119}}

Old Japanese is usually defined as the language of the [[Nara period]] (710–794), when the capital was  [[Heijō-kyō]] (present-day [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]).{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=119}}{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=1}}
This is the period of the earliest connected texts in Japanese, the 112 songs included in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' (712).
The other major literary sources of the period are the 128 songs included in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720) and the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' (c. 759), a compilation of over 4,500 poems.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=17}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=24}}
Shorter samples are 25 poems in the ''[[Fudoki]]'' (720) and the 21 poems of the ''[[Bussokuseki-kahi]]'' (c. 752).
The latter has the virtue of being an original inscription, whereas for all the other texts the oldest surviving manuscripts are the results of centuries of copying, with the attendant risk of scribal errors.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=19–20}}
Prose texts are more limited, but are thought to reflect the syntax of Old Japanese more accurately than verse.
The most important are the 27 ''[[Norito]]'' (liturgies) recorded in the ''[[Engishiki]]'' (compiled in 927) and the 62 ''Senmyō'' (imperial edicts) recorded in the ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' (797).{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=24}}{{sfn|Bentley|2001|p=6}}

A limited number of Japanese words, mostly personal names and place names, are recorded phonetically in ancient Chinese texts such as the "Wei Zhi" portion of the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (3rd century AD), but the transcriptions by Chinese scholars are unreliable.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=5–8}}
The oldest surviving native inscriptions, dating from the 5th or early 6th centuries, include those on the [[Suda Hachiman Shrine Mirror]], the [[Inariyama Sword]] and the [[Eta Funayama Sword]].
These inscriptions are written in [[Classical Chinese]], but contain several Japanese names transcribed phonetically using Chinese characters.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=10}}{{sfn|Seeley|1991|pp=16–25}}
Such inscriptions become more common from the [[Suiko period]] (592–628).{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=12}}
These fragments are usually considered a form of Old Japanese.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=66}}

==Writing system==
{{main|Man'yōgana|Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai}}
Artifacts inscribed with Chinese characters dated as early as the 1st century AD have been found in Japan, but it appears that detailed knowledge of the script did not arrive in the islands until the early 5th century.
According to the ''Kojiki'' and ''Nihon Shoki'', it was brought by scholars from [[Baekje]] (southwest Korea).{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=8–9}}
The earliest texts found in Japan are written in [[Classical Chinese]], probably by immigrant scribes.
Later "hybrid" texts show the influence of Japanese grammar, such as the [[word order]] (for example, placing the verb after the object).{{sfn|Seeley|1991|pp=25–31}}

Chinese and Koreans had long used Chinese characters to write non-Chinese terms and proper names phonetically, by selecting characters for Chinese words that sounded like each syllable.
Koreans also used the characters phonetically to write Korean particles and inflections added to Chinese texts as an aid to reading ([[Idu script]]).
In Japan, the practice was developed into ''[[man'yōgana]]'', a complete script for the Japanese language using Chinese characters phonetically, and the ancestor of modern [[kana]] syllabaries.{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=126}}
This system was already in use in the verse parts of the ''[[Kojiki]]'' (712) and the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720).{{sfn|Seeley|1991|pp=41–49}}{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=18–20, 28–40}}
For example, the first line of the first poem in the ''Kojiki'' was written with five characters:{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=1, 18, 22}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=19}}

|-
!
| colspan="5" | 'many clouds rising'
|}

This method of writing Japanese syllables by using characters for their Chinese sounds (''ongana'') was supplemented with indirect methods in the complex mixed script of the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' (c. 759).{{sfn|Seeley|1991|pp=49–53}}{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=20, 24–27}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=17–20}}

===Syllables===

In ''man'yōgana'', each Old Japanese syllable was represented by a Chinese character.  Although any one of several characters could be used for a given syllable, a careful analysis revealed that 88 syllables were distinguished in the ''Kojiki'':{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=49–51}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=26–27}}

The system has the same gaps of ''yi'' and ''wu'' found in later forms of Japanese.
However, many syllables that have a modern ''i'', ''e'' or ''o'' occurred in two forms, termed types {{nihongo|''A''|甲|kō}} and {{nihongo|''B''|乙|otsu}}, denoted by subscripts 1 and 2 respectively in the above table.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=49–51}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=28–29}}
The syllables ''mo''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''mo''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are not distinguished in the slightly later ''Nihon Shoki'' and ''Man'yōshū'', reducing the syllable count to 87.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=51}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=30}}
All of these pairs had merged by the [[Early Middle Japanese]] of the [[Heian period]].{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=84}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=26}}

==Phonology==
There is no consensus on the pronunciation of the syllables distinguished by ''man'yōgana''.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=2}}
One difficulty is that the [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciations of the characters used are also disputed, and since their reconstruction is partly based on [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] pronunciations, there is a danger of circular reasoning.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=54–55, 63–64}}
Additional evidence has been drawn from phonological [[linguistic typology|typology]], subsequent developments in the Japanese pronunciation, and comparative study of the [[Ryukyuan languages]].{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=64–65}}

===Restrictions===

Old Japanese had [[open syllable]]s, of the form (C)V, subject to additional restrictions:
* Words do not begin with ''r'' or the voiced plosives ''b'', ''d'', ''z'' and ''g'', with the exception of a few loanwords.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=43}}
* A bare vowel does not occur except for word-initially: vowel sequences were not permitted.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=39}}

In 1934, [[Arisaka Hideyo]] proposed a set of phonological restrictions permitted in a single morpheme.
''Arisaka's Law'' states that ''-o''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is generally not found in the same morpheme as ''-a'', ''-o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or ''-u''.
Some scholars have interpreted this as a vestige of earlier [[vowel harmony]], but it is very different from patterns observed in e.g. the [[Turkic languages]].{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=44}}

===Vowels===

The Chinese characters chosen to write syllables with the Old Japanese vowel ''a'' suggest that it was an [[open vowel|open]] unrounded vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=198–203}}
The vowel ''u'' was a [[close rounded back vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}}, unlike the unrounded {{IPA|/ɯ/}} of Modern Standard Japanese.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=207–211}}

Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain the A/B distinctions made in ''man'yōgana''. The issue is hotly debated, and there is no consensus.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=62}}
The widely accepted traditional view, first advanced by [[Kyōsuke Kindaichi]] in 1938, is that there were eight pure vowels, with the type B vowels being more central than their type A counterparts.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=55}}
Others, beginning in the 1930s but more commonly since the work of Roland Lange in 1968, attribute the type A/B distinction to medial or final [[semivowel|glide]]s {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=55–57}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=32}}
The diphthong proposals are often connected to hypotheses about pre-Old Japanese, but all exhibit an uneven distribution of glides.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=32}}

The distinction between ''mo''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''mo''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is only seen in ''Kojiki'' and vanished afterwards.
Distributionally, there may have once been *''po''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, *''po''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, *''bo''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and *''bo''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=30}}
If this is true, then a distinction was made between C''o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C''o''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for all consonants C except for ''w''. Some take this as support that C''o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may have represented C''wo''.

==== Pre-Old Japanese ====

Most scholars derive the Old Japanese vowel system from an earlier four-vowel system, with the most common Old Japanese vowels ''a'', ''u'', ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''o''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reflecting earlier *a, *u, *i and *ə respectively.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=44}}
[[Internal reconstruction]] suggests that the other, less common, Old Japanese vowels are derived from fusions of these vowels.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=80–81}}
For example, the place name ''take''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''ti'' is derived from a compound of ''taka-'' 'high' and ''iti'' 'market'.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=81}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=46}}
Another piece of evidence is that many nouns have different forms when used independently and when used within compounds.
An example is ''sake''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 'rice wine', which becomes ''saka-'' in compounds such as ''sakaduki'' 'saké cup'.
In such cases the bound form is considered basic, and the independent form may be explained by postulating a suffix *-i that fused with the final vowel of the root.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=80}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=45}}
The following reductions are proposed:
* ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *ui: ''kami''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''kamu''- 'god, spirit',{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=80}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=45}} ''mi''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''mu''- 'eye',{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=45}}{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=134}} ''nagi''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''nagu''- 'a calm'.{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=134}}
* ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *əi: ''ki''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''ko''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'tree',{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=80}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=45}} ''yomi''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''yomo''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'Hades'.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=45}}
* ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *ia: ''sake''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ri'' 'blooming' &lt; ''saki''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 'to bloom' + ''ari'' 'to be'.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=48}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=499}}
* ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *iə: ''pe''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ku'' (proper name) &lt; ''pi''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 'sun' + ''o''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''ki''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 'put'.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=48}}
* ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *ai: ''me''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''ma''- 'eye',{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=45}} ''ame''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''ama''- 'heaven', ''ame''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''ama''- 'rain', ''kage''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''kaga''- 'shade'.{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=133}}
* ''o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *ua: ''kazo''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''pu'' 'to count' &lt; ''kazu'' 'number' + ''apu'' 'to combine'.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=81}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=48}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=498–499}}
* ''o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *uə: ''sito''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ri'' 'kind of native weaving' &lt; ''situ'' 'native weaving' + ''ori'' 'weaving'.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=81}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=48}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=498}}
There are also alternations suggesting ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *əi, such as:
* ''se''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''so''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'back', ''me''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''mo''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'bud'{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=45}}
Some authors believe these belong to an earlier layer than ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; *əi, while others reconstruct two central vowels *ə and *ɨ, which merge everywhere except before *i.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=499}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=45–47}}
Other authors attribute this variation to different reflexes in different dialects, noting that *əi yields ''e'' in [[Ryukyuan languages]].{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=661}}
Some authors also suggest that *e and *o are required to account for word-final ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=47–48}}

===Consonants===

The voiceless obstruents {{IPA|/p, t, s, k/}} had the voiced prenasalized counterparts {{IPA|/ᵐb, ⁿd, ⁿz, ᵑɡ/}}.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=196}}
This prenasalization was still present in the late 17th century (according to the Korean textbook ''Chephay sine''), and is found in some modern Japanese and Ryukyuan dialects, but has disappeared in Modern Japanese, except for the intervocalic nasal stop allophone {{IPA|[ŋ]}} of {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=75–76}}
The sibilants {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ⁿz/}} may have been palatalized before ''e'' and ''i''.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=183, 186}}

Comparative evidence from [[Ryukyuan languages]] suggests that Old Japanese ''p'' derives from an earlier [[voiceless bilabial stop]] *p.{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=194}}
There is general agreement that word-initial ''p'' had become a [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}} by Early Middle Japanese, as suggested by its transcription as ''f'' in later Portuguese works and as ''ph'' or ''hw'' in the Korean textbook ''Chephay sine''.
In Modern Standard Japanese, it is romanized as ''h'' and has different [[allophone]]s before various vowels.
In medial position, it became {{IPA|[w]}} in Early Middle Japanese, and has since disappeared except before ''a''.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=74}}
Many scholars argue that ''p'' had already lenited to {{IPA|[ɸ]}} by the Old Japanese period, but Miyake argues that it was still a stop.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=71, 164–166}}

====Pre-Old Japanese====
Internal reconstruction suggests that the Old Japanese voiced obstruents, which always occurred in medial position, arose from weakening of earlier nasal syllables before voiceless obstruents:{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=73}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=42–43}}
* ''b'' {{IPA|/ᵐb/}} &lt; *-mVp-, *-nVp-: e.g. ''abi''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ki''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 'trawling' &lt; ''ami''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 'net' + ''pi''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ki''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 'pull'.
* ''d'' {{IPA|/ⁿd/}} &lt; *-mVt-, *-nVt-: e.g. ''yamadi'' 'mountain path' &lt; ''yama'' 'mountain' + ''mi''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''ti'' 'path'.
* ''z'' {{IPA|/ⁿz/}} &lt; *-mVs-, *-nVs-: e.g. the title ''murazi'' &lt; ''mura'' 'village' + ''nusi'' 'master'.
* ''g'' {{IPA|/ᵑɡ/}} &lt; *-mVk-, *-nVk-.
In some cases there is no evidence for a preceding vowel, leading some scholars to posit final nasals at the earlier stage.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=43}}

Some linguists suggest that Old Japanese ''w'' and ''y'' derive respectively from *b and *d at some point before the oldest inscriptions in the 6th century.{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=71–73}}
[[Southern Ryukyuan languages|Southern Ryukyuan varieties]] such as [[Miyako language|Miyako]], [[Yaeyama language|Yaeyama]] and [[Yonaguni language|Yonaguni]] retain {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} in these words:{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=194}}
* ''ba'' 'I' and ''bata'' 'stomach' corresponding to Old Japanese ''wa'' and ''wata''
* Yonaguni ''da'' 'house', ''du'' 'hot water' and ''dama'' 'mountain' corresponding to Old Japanese ''ya'', ''yu'' and ''yama''
However, many linguists, especially in Japan, argue that the Southern Ryukyuan voiced stops are local innovations.{{sfn|Vovin|2010|pp=36–44}}
Some supporters of *b and *d also add *z and *g, both disappearing in Old Japanese, for reasons of symmetry.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=666}}
However, there is very little Japonic evidence for these.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=43}}{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=68–71}}

===Morphophonemics===

Vowel elision occurred to prevent vowel clusters.
When a monosyllabic morpheme is followed by a polysyllabic morpheme beginning with a vowel, the second vowel is dropped:{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=662}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=39–40}}
* ''wa'' + ''ga'' + ''ipe''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''wagape''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
In other environments, the first vowel is dropped:{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=662}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=39–40}}
* ''ake'' + ''u'' → ''aku''
* ''to''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''ko''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''ipa'' → ''to''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''kipa''
* ''ko''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i'' → ''ki''

===Accent===

Although modern [[Japanese dialects]] have [[pitch accent]] systems, these are usually not shown in ''man'yōgana''.
However, in one part of the ''Nihon Shoki'', the Chinese characters appear to be chosen to represent a pitch pattern similar to that recorded in the ''[[Ruiju Myōgishō]]'', a dictionary compiled in the late 11th century.
In this section, a low pitch syllable is represented by a character with the [[Middle Chinese]] level tone, and a high pitch is represented by a character with one of the other three [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|Middle Chinese tones]].
(A similar division was used in the [[tone pattern]]s of Chinese poetry, which were emulated by Japanese poets in the late [[Asuka period]].)
Thus it appears that the Old Japanese accent system was similar to that of [[Early Middle Japanese]].{{sfn|Miyake|2003|pp=37–39}}

==Grammar==
{{expand section|date=November 2014}}

As in later forms of Japanese, Old Japanese word order was predominantly [[subject–object–verb]], with adjectives and adverbs preceding the nouns and verbs they modify, and [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[grammatical particle|particle]]s consistently appended to the main verb.{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|pp=122–123}}

===Pronouns===

Many Old Japanese pronouns had both a short form and a longer form with attached ''-re'' of uncertain etymology.
Where the pronoun occurred in isolation, the longer form would be used.
With genitive particles or in nominal compounds, the short form was used, whereas in other situations either form was possible.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=136–137}}

[[Personal pronouns]] were distinguished by taking the [[genitive case|genitive]] marker ''ga'', in contrast to the marker ''no''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used with demonstratives and nouns.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=138}}
* The first [[grammatical person|person]] pronouns were ''a(re)'' and ''wa(re)'', were used for the singular and plural respectively, though with some overlap.  The ''wa-'' forms were also used [[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]ly, suggesting that ''wa'' was originally an [[indefinite pronoun]] and gradually replaced ''a''.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=138}}
* The second person pronoun was ''na(re)''.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=136}}
* The third person pronoun ''si'' was much less commonly used than the non-proximal demonstrative ''so''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, from which it was derived.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=138–139}}
* There were also an [[interrogative pronoun]] ''ta(re)'' and a reflexive pronoun ''o''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''no''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=136}}

[[Demonstrative]]s often distinguished proximal (to the speaker) and non-proximal forms marked with ''ko''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- and ''so''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- respectively.
Many forms had corresponding interrogative forms ''i(du)-''.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=139–140}}

In Early Middle Japanese, the non-proximal ''so-'' forms were re-interpreted as hearer-based (medial), and the formerly speaker-based forms divided into proximal ''ko-'' forms and distal ''ka-''/''a-'' forms, yielding the three-way distinction still found in Modern Japanese.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=140, 246–247}}

=== Verbs ===

Old Japanese had a richer system of verbal suffixes than later forms of Japanese.{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=123}}
Old Japanese verbs used [[inflection]] for [[linguistic modality|modal]] and [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]al purposes.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=53}}
Other categories, such as [[voice (grammar)|voice]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], were expressed using optional suffixed [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]], which were also inflected.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=59}}

==== Inflected forms ====

As in later forms of Japanese, Old Japanese verbs had a large number of inflected forms.
In traditional Japanese grammar, these are represented by six forms (''katsuyōkei'', 活用形) from which all the others may be derived, in a similar fashion to the [[principal parts]] used for [[Latin language|Latin]] and other languages:{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=114–118}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|未然形|Mizenkei}}'' (irrealis)
:This form never occurs in isolation, but only as a stem to which several particles and auxiliaries are attached.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=111–112}} Unger calls it a "pseudostem", because the purported inflection was originally an initial *a of the suffixes attached to this stem.{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=665}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|連用形|Renyoukei}}'' (adverbial, infinitive)
:This form was used as the [[infinitive]].{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=56–57}}  It also served as a stem for auxiliaries expressing tense and aspect.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=109–111}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|終止形|Shushikei}}'' (conclusive, predicative)
:This form was used as the main verb concluding a declarative sentence.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=53}}  It was also used before modal extensions, final particles and some conjunctional particles.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=123–124, 133}} The conclusive form merged with the attributive form by about 1600, but the distinction is preserved in Ryukyuan languages and the [[Hachijōjima dialects]].{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|pp=195, 207, 223–224}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|連体形|Rentaikei}}'' (attributive, adnominal)
:This form was used as the verb in a nominalized clause or a clause modifying a noun.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=54–55}}  It was also used before most conjunctional particles.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=133}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|已然形|Izenkei}}'' (realis, exclamatory, subjunctive)
:This form was used as the main verb in an exclamatory sentence or as the verb in an adverbial clause.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=55}}  It also served as a stem for the particles ''-ba'' (provisional) and ''-do'' (concessive).{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=112–113}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|命令形|Meireikei}}'' (imperative)
:This form expressed the [[imperative mood]].{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=55}}
This system has been criticized because the six forms are not equivalent, with one being solely a combinatory stem, three solely word forms, and two being both.
It also fails to capture some inflected forms.
However, five of the forms are basic inflected verb forms, and the system also describes almost all extended forms in a consistent way.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=116–118}}

==== Conjugation classes ====

Japanese verbs are classified into eight conjugation classes, each characterized by different patterns of inflected forms.
Three of these classes are grouped as consonant bases:{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=96}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|四段活用|Yodan}}'' (quadrigrade)
:This class of regular consonant-base verbs includes approximately 75% of verbs.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=96}}  The class is so named because the inflections in later forms of Japanese span four rows of a ''[[kana]]'' table, corresponding to four vowels.  However, in Old Japanese five different vowels are involved.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=115}}  These bases are almost all of the form (C)VC-, with the final consonant limited to ''p'', ''t'', ''k'', ''b'', ''g'', ''m'', ''s'' or ''r''.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=97}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|ナ行変格活用|Na-hen}}'' (''n''-irregular)
:The three ''n''-base verbs form a class of their own: ''sin-'' 'die', ''-in-'' 'depart' and the auxiliary ''-(i)n-'' expressing completion of an action.  They are often described as a "hybrid" conjugation, because the adnominal and exclamatory forms follow a similar pattern to vowel-base verbs.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=105}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|ラ行変格活用|Ra-hen}}'' (''r''-irregular)
:The irregular ''r''-base verbs are ''ar-'' 'be, exist' and other verbs incorporating it, as well as ''wor-'' 'sit', which became the existential verb ''or-'' in later forms of Japanese.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=101–103}}

The distinctions between ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and between ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are lost after ''s'', ''z'', ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', ''y'', ''r'' and ''w''.

There are five vowel-base conjugation classes:
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|下二段活用|Shimo nidan}}'' (lower bigrade or ''e''-bigrade)
:The largest regular vowel-base class comprises bases ending in ''e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and includes approximately 20% of verbs.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=97}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|上二段活用|Kami nidan}}'' (upper bigrade or ''i''-bigrade)
:This class of bases ending in ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains about 30 verbs.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=97}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|上一段活用|Kami ichidan}}'' (upper monograde or ''i''-monograde)
:This class contains about 10 verbs of the form (C)''i''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-.  Some monosyllabic upper bigrade verbs had already shifted to this class by the Old Japanese period, and the rest followed in Early Middle Japanese.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=106}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|カ行変格活用|Ka-hen}}'' (''k''-irregular)
:This class consists of the single verb ''ko''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'come'.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=107–108}}
;''{{wikt-lang|ja|サ行変格活用|Sa-hen}}'' (''s''-irregular)
:This class consists of the single verb ''se-'' 'do'.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=107–108}}
Early Middle Japanese also had a ''{{wikt-lang|ja|下一段活用|Shimo ichidan}}'' (lower monograde or ''e''-monograde) category consisting of a single verb ''kwe-'' 'kick', which reflects the Old Japanese lower bigrade verb ''kuwe-''.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=227–228}}{{sfn|Yamaguchi|Suzuki|Sakanashi|Tsukimoto|1997|p=18}}{{sfn|Kondō|Tsukimoto|Sugiura|2005|p=41}}{{sfn|Omodaka|1967|pp=37–38}}

|}

The bigrade verbs seem to belong to a later layer than the consonant-base verbs.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=120}}
Many ''e''-bigrade verbs are [[transitive verb|transitive]] or [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] counterparts of consonant-stem verbs.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=118–119}}
In contrast, ''i''-bigrade verbs tend to be intransitive.{{sfn|Whitman|2008|p=164}}
Some bigrade bases also appear to reflect pre-Old-Japanese adjectives with vowel stems combined with an [[inchoative verb|inchoative]] *-i suffix:{{sfn|Unger|2000|p=665}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=119}}{{sfn|Whitman|2008|p=165}}
* *-a-i &gt; ''-e''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, e.g. ''ake''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'redden, lighten' vs ''aka'' 'red'.
* *-u-i &gt; ''-i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, e.g. ''sabi''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'get desolate, fade' vs ''sabu-'' 'lonely'.
* *-ə-i &gt; ''-i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, e.g. ''opi''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- 'get big, grow' vs ''opo-'' 'big'.

===Adjectives===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2014}}

There were two types of adjectives: regular [[adjective]]s and [[adjectival noun (Japanese)|adjectival noun]]s.

The regular adjective is sub-classified into two types: those where the adverbial form ({{lang|ja|連用形}}) ends in ''-ku''  and those that end in ''-siku.'' This creates two different types of conjugations:

| ''-ke''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;''-ke''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''re''
| &amp;nbsp;
|-

| ''-siku''
| ''-si''
| ''-siki''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
| ''-sike''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;''-sike''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''re''
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| ''-sikara''
| ''-sikari''
| ''-si''
| ''-sikaru''
| ''-sikare''
| ''-sikare''
|}

The ''-kar-'' and ''-sikar-'' forms are derived from the adverbial conjugation (''-ku'' or ''-siku'') suffixed with verb ''ar-'' "be, exists". The conjugation yields to the R-irregular conjugation of ''ar-''. As Old Japanese avoids vowel clusters, the resulting ''-ua-'' is reduced to ''-a-''.{{sfn|Bentley|2012|p=197}}

The adjectival noun has a single conjugation:

==Dialects==
Although the majority of Old Japanese writing represents the language of the [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] court in central Japan, some sources come from eastern Japan:{{sfn|Vovin|2005}}{{sfn|Miyake|2003|p=159}}{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=23–24, 151}}
* 230 ''azuma uta'' 'eastern songs' in volume 14 of the ''Man'yōshū'',
* 93 ''sakimori uta'' 'borderguard songs' in volume 20 of the ''Man'yōshū'', and
* 9 songs in the ''Hitachi [[fudoki]]'' (714–718).
They record Eastern Old Japanese dialects,{{sfn|Kupchik|2011}} with features such as:
* There is no type A/B distinction on front vowels ''i'' and ''e'', though ''o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''o''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are distinguished.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=152}}
* Pre-Old Japanese *ia yielded ''a'' in the east, where Central Old Japanese has ''e''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=152}}
* The adnominal form of consonant-base verbs ended in ''-o''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, where Central Old Japanese has ''-u'' as in the conclusive form.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|pp=152–153}} A similar difference is preserved in [[Ryukyuan languages]], suggesting that Central Old Japanese had innovated by merging these endings.{{sfn|Bentley|2012|p=189}}
* The imperative form of vowel-base verbs attached ''-ro''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, instead of the ''-yo''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; used in Central Old Japanese.{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=153}}
* There are a group of distinctive negative auxiliaries.  However, they do not seem to be the source of the different negatives in modern eastern and western [[Japanese dialects]].{{sfn|Frellesvig|2010|p=153}}

Telepractice is a method of reaching students and individuals in any distant location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=20010122&amp;id=tVFUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5013,4936776 | title=New Internet Program Enhances Speech Therapy | work=Boca Raton News | date=Jan 22, 2001 | accessdate=14 March 2014 | pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telepractice is defined by the [[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association]] (ASHA) as the use of technology to provide speech therapy services to remote regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/academic/questions/Telehealth-and-Telepractices/ | title=What should I know about telehealth and telepractice?

==Assessment==
Assessment for online speech therapy consists of an informal oral exam by a licensed trained professional through video conferencing or a web application. Patients are initially screened for communication disorders with diagnosis and consultation for provision counseling including cognitive aspects of communication, syntax, [[hypophonia]] and upper aerodigestive functions. The [[therapist]] and patient communicate via telecommunication technology where they can interact in real time. Therapy may cover speech sound production, fluency, language, cognition and written language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/Practice-Portal/Professional-Issues/Telepractice/ | title=Telepractice Overview | publisher=asha.org | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapists create an assessment document or report that is updated after every session. The document is reported to the parents or the referral source in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and [[FERPA]]. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act also known as HIPAA is a federal law that protects patient medical records. HIPAA specifically protects “individually identifiable health information.” The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act known as FERPA is a federal law that protects student education records. FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children’s education records until they turn 18 or transfer to a school higher than the high school level, thus making them “eligible students.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.asha.org/2014/04/15/beyond-skype-for-online-therapy-protecting-student-privacy/#_ga=1.131523532.2146824548.1428276224|title=Beyond Skype for Online Therapy: Protecting Student Privacy - Leader Live — Happening now in the speech-language-hearing world|date=15 April 2014|website=asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical departments in Universities also offer speech and language therapy services where they keep recorded video of sessions between clinicians and patients secured through password security services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sphs.osu.edu/clinic/speech-language-services/telepractice | title=Telepractice, Department of Speech &amp; Hearing Science | publisher=The Ohio State University | accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course==
Online speech therapy courses are offered by professional associations, Universities and cyber schools for treatment of communication disorders. The minimum eligibility for an online speech therapy course is a bachelor's degree for Master's entry-level field and master's degree for CScD offered by professional associations and Universities in the United States. The speech therapist course is not available for Bachelors or under graduate degree level in the United States. The pathologists are required to attain a minimum of 400 clinical hours to complete the course. In Asian countries, the course is open for Bachelors level degree program offered by Universities.

Speech Pathologist are also required to complete 400 hours clinical hours and pass the KASA exams in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47486">{{about|the process of ordaining clergy}}
'''Ordination''' is the process by which individuals are [[Consecration|consecrated]], that is, set apart as [[clergy]] to perform various religious [[Ritual|rites and ceremonies]]. The process and ceremonies of ordination vary by [[religion]] and [[Religious denomination|denomination]]. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The [[liturgy]] used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordination.

==Buddhism==
[[Image:Novitiate Buddhist ordination.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Novitiate [[Buddhist]] ordination]]
{{Main|Vinaya}}

The tradition of the ordained [[monasticism|monastic]] community (''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'') began with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], who established orders of [[monk]]s and later of [[nun]]s. The procedure of ordination in [[Buddhism]] is laid down in the [[Vinaya]] and [[Patimokkha]] or [[Pratimoksha]] scriptures. There exist three intact ordination lineages nowadays in which one can receive an ordination according to the Buddha's teachings:{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* [[Dharmaguptaka]] Lineage
* [[Pratimoksha|Mulasarvastivadin]] Lineage
* [[Patimokkha|Theravada]] Lineage

===Mahayana===
{{Main|Mahayana Buddhism}}
[[Saicho]] repeatedly requested that the Japanese government allow the construction of a Mahayana ordination platform. Permission was granted in 822 CE, seven days after Saicho died. The platform was finished in 827 CE at [[Enryaku-ji temple]] on [[Mount Hiei]], and was the first in Japan. Prior to this, those wishing to become monks/nuns were ordained using the [[Theravada Buddhism|Hinayana]] precepts, whereas after the Mahayana ordination platform, people were ordained with the [[Bodhisattva]] precepts as listed in the [[Brahma Net Sutra]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahayana Ordination Platform "Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada===
{{Main|Sangha (Buddhism)#Women's role in the Sangha|l1=Sangha § Ordination process|Bhikkhu|Bhikkhuni|Theravada#Ordination |Pabbajja}}

''Pabbajja'' is an ordination procedure for novice Buddhist monks in the [[Theravada]] tradition.

===Fully ordained nuns===
The legitimacy of fully ordained nuns (''bhikkhuni/bhiksuni'') has become a significant topic of discussion in recent years. Texts passed down in every Buddhist tradition record that Gautama Buddha created an order of fully ordained nuns, but the tradition has died out in some Buddhist traditions such as Theravada Buddhism, while remaining strong in others such as [[Chinese Buddhism]] ([[Dharmaguptaka]] lineage). In the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan lineage]], which follows the Mulasarvastivadin lineage, the lineage of fully ordained nuns was not brought to [[Tibet]] by the Indian [[Vinaya]] masters, hence there is no rite for the ordination of full nuns. However [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|th 14th Dalai Lama]] has endeavored for many years to improve this situation.&lt;ref name="possibility"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=30|title=Press|author=|date=|website=www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115233532/http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=30|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, he asked fully ordained nuns in the Dharmaguptaka lineage, especially [[Jampa Tsedroen]], to form a committee to work for the acceptance of the ''bhiksuni'' lineage within the Tibetan tradition,&lt;ref name="possibility"/&gt; and donated €50,000 for further research. The "1st International Congress on Buddhist Women’s Role in the Sangha: Bhikshuni Vinaya and Ordination Lineages" was held at the University of Hamburg from July 18–20, 2007, in cooperation with the University’s Asia-Africa Institute. Although the general tenor was that full ordination was overdue, the Dalai Lama presented a pre-drafted statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=142|title=Statement of H.H.-the Dalai Lama|author=|date=|website=www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002220637/http://www.congress-on-buddhist-women.org/index.php?id=142|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that more time was required to reach a decision, thus nullifying the intentions of the congress.

===Posthumous ordination===
In Medieval [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]], a tradition of posthumous ordination was developed to give the laity access to [[Japanese funeral|Zen funeral rites]]. Chinese Ch’an monastic codes, from which Japanese [[Sōtō]] practices were derived, contain only monastic funeral rites; there were no provisions made for funerals for lay believers. To solve this problem, the Sōtō school developed the practice of ordaining laypeople after death, thus allowing monastic funeral rites to be used for them as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[William M. Bodiford]], ''Soto Zen in Medieval Japan'' (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993), 195–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Kadampa Tradition===
{{Main|New Kadampa Tradition#Ordination}}
{{POV section|date=November 2015}}
The Buddhist ordination tradition of the [[New Kadampa Tradition]]-International Kadampa Buddhist Union (NKT-IKBU) is not the traditional Buddhist ordination, but rather one newly created by [[Kelsang Gyatso]]. Although those ordained within this organisation are called 'monks' and 'nuns' within the organisation, and wear the robes of traditional Tibetan monks and nuns, in terms of traditional Buddhism they are neither fully ordained monks and nuns (Skt.: [[Bhikkhu|bhikshu]], [[Bhikkhuni|bhikshuni]]; Tib.: gelong, gelongma) nor are they novice monks and nuns (Skt.: sramanera, srameneri; Tib.: gestul, getsulma).&lt;ref name="info-buddhism.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-buddhism.com/new_kadampa_tradition.html#Ordination|title=New Kadampa Tradition – Kadampa Buddhism (NKT-IKBU) - Kadampa Meditation Center|author=|date=|website=info-buddhism.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705125525/https://info-buddhism.com/new_kadampa_tradition.html#Ordination|archivedate=5 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="buddhism-controversy-blog.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhism-controversy-blog.com/?s=ordination|title=Search Results for “ordination” – Tibetan Buddhism – Struggling With Diffi·Cult Issues|author=|date=|website=buddhism-controversy-blog.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160226074301/http://buddhism-controversy-blog.com/?s=ordination|archivedate=26 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/|title=Vinaya Pitaka: The Basket of the Discipline|author=|date=|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509220219/https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/vin/|archivedate=9 May 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/148.htm|title=What Buddhists Believe - What is Vinaya?|first=|last=BuddhaSasana|date=|website=www.budsas.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827074242/http://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/148.htm|archivedate=27 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Fully_ordained_monk|title=Fully ordained monk - Rigpa Wiki|author=|date=|website=www.rigpawiki.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725203458/http://rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Fully_ordained_monk|archivedate=25 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Pratimoksha_vows|title=Pratimoksha vows - Rigpa Wiki|author=|date=|website=www.rigpawiki.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826051341/http://rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Pratimoksha_vows|archivedate=26 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Gelong|title=Fully ordained monk - Rigpa Wiki|author=|date=|website=www.rigpawiki.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702050922/http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Gelong|archivedate=2 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other Buddhist traditions, including all Tibetan Buddhist schools, which follow the Vinaya, the NKT-IKBU ordination consists of the [[Five Precepts]] of a lay person, plus five more precepts created by [[Kelsang Gyatso]]. He is said to view them as a “practical condensation” of the 253 Vinaya vows of fully ordained monks.&lt;ref name="info-buddhism.com"/&gt;

[[Image:Priestly ordination.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ordination of a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] (pre-1968 form of the [[Roman Rite]]).]]

Ordination is one of the seven [[sacraments]], variously called [[holy orders]] or ''[[Christian laying on of hands|cheirotonia]]'' ("[[Laying on of Hands]]").

[[Apostolic succession]] is considered an essential and necessary concept for ordination, in the belief that all ordained clergy are ordained by bishops who were ordained by other bishops tracing back to bishops ordained by the [[Apostles]] who were ordained by [[Christ]], the great High Priest ({{Bibleverse||Hebrews|7:26}}, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|8:2}}), who conferred his priesthood upon his Apostles ({{Bibleverse||John|20:21–23}}, {{Bibleverse||Matthew|28:19–20}}, {{Bibleverse||Mark|16:15–18}}, and {{Bibleverse||Acts|2:33}}).&lt;ref name=SB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintbarbara.org/faith/sacraments/priesthood/sac_priesthood.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217213246/http://www.saintbarbara.org/faith/sacraments/priesthood/sac_priesthood.cfm |archivedate=2005-12-17 |df= }} "The Orthodox Faith &amp;mdash; The Sacrament of the Holy Priesthood", Retrieved 2011-08-03&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three "degrees" of ordination (or holy orders): [[deacon]], [[presbyter]], and [[bishop]].  Both bishops and presbyters are [[priest#Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy|priest]]s and have authority to celebrate the Eucharist. In [[Presbyter#Modern usage|common use]], however, the term ''priest'', when unqualified, refers to the rank of presbyter, whereas ''presbyter'' is mainly used in rites of ordination and other places where a technical and precise term is required.

Ordination of a bishop is performed by several bishops; ordination of a priest or deacon is performed by a single bishop.  The ordination of a new bishop is also called a [[consecration]].  Many ancient sources specify that at least three bishops are necessary to consecrate another, e.g., the 13th Canon of the Council of Carthage (AD 394) states, "A bishop should not be ordained except by many bishops, but if there should be necessity he may be ordained by three,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-146.htm#P8134_1642585] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314125940/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-146.htm |date=2012-03-14 }}, "Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers &amp;mdash; The Seven Ecumenical Councils, p641", Retrieved 2011-08-03&lt;/ref&gt; and the first of "The Canons of the Holy and Altogether August Apostles" states, "Let a bishop be ordained by two or three bishops," while the second canon thereof states, "Let a presbyter, deacon, and the rest of the clergy, be ordained by one bishop";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-178.htm#P10875_2117776] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314125947/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-178.htm |date=2012-03-14 }}, "Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers &amp;mdash; The Seven Ecumenical Councils, p839", Retrieved 2011-08-03&lt;/ref&gt; the latter canons, whatever their origin, were imposed on the universal church by the Seventh [[Ecumenical Council]], the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], in its first canon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-167.htm#P10346_1983930] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905150322/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-167.htm |date=2011-09-05 }}, "Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers &amp;mdash; The Seven Ecumenical Councils, P790", Retrieved 2011-08-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a person ordained to the priesthood may administer certain sacraments (most especially, hear [[confession (religion)|confession]]s, serve as the ordinary minister of giving the host during Communion, anointing the sick- unction, presiding at Requiem or Memorial services or religious marriages involving a Mass, or celebrating any Mass- the Eucharist).

====Details peculiar to the various denominations====
The [[Catholic Church]] teaches that one bishop is sufficient to consecrate a new bishop validly (that is, for an episcopal ordination actually to take place). In most Christian denominations that retain the practice of ordination, only an already ordained (consecrated) bishop or the equivalent may ordain bishops, priests, and deacons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pius XII|title=Episcopali consecrationis|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19441130_episcopali-consecrationis_lt.html|accessdate=20 September 2013|quote=Episcopalis Consecrationis Ministrum esse Episcopum et ad huius Consecrationis validitatem unum solum sufficere Episcopum, qui cum debita mentis intentione essentiales ritus perficiat, extra omne dubium est diuturnaque praxi comprobatum.

In the Roman Catholic Church, those deacons destined to be ordained priests are often termed ''transitional deacons''; those deacons who are married before being ordained, as well as any unmarried deacons who chose not to be ordained priests, are called ''permanent deacons''. Those married deacons who become widowers have the possibility of seeking ordination to the priesthood in exceptional cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Directory for the Formation, Ministry, and Life of Permanent Deacons in the United States|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|location=Chapter 2, No. 77|page=37|url=http://old.usccb.org/deacon/DeaconDirectory.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711045955/http://old.usccb.org/deacon/DeaconDirectory.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some Eastern churches have in the past recognized [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] ordinations as valid,&lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/alexandria.pdf "Orthodox Statements on Anglican Orders"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723233345/http://orthodoxanglican.net/downloads/alexandria.pdf |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the current Anglican practice, in many provinces, of ordaining women to the priesthood&amp;mdash;and, in some cases, to the episcopate&amp;mdash;has caused the Orthodox generally to question earlier declarations of validity and hopes for union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/ministry/ecumenical/dialogues/orthodox/docs/the_dublin_statement.cfm#s2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131083118/http://www.anglicancommunion.org/ministry/ecumenical/dialogues/orthodox/docs/the_dublin_statement.cfm |date=2011-01-31 }}"Unity Faith and Order – Dialogues – Anglican Orthodox," Introduction, par. 2 ("From Moscow to Lambeth (1976–8)&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church has never recognized Anglican orders as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leo XII|title=Apostolicae Curae|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13curae.htm|accessdate=20 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060908/http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13curae.htm|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Anglicanism recognizes Roman Catholic and Orthodox ordinations; hence, clergy converting to Anglicanism are not "re-ordained".

Some [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches recognize Roman Catholic ordinations while others "re-ordain" Roman Catholic clergy (as well as Anglicans) who convert.  However, both the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches recognize Orthodox ordinations.

In the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, ordinations have traditionally been held on [[Ember Days]], though there is no limit to the number of clergy who may be ordained at the same service.  In the Eastern Orthodox Church, ordinations may be performed any day of the year on which the [[Divine Liturgy]] may be celebrated (and deacons may also be ordained at the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts|Presanctified Liturgy]]), but only one person may be ordained to each rank at any given service, that is, at most one bishop, one presbyter, and one deacon may be ordained at the same liturgy.&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{Citation

====Notes====
* There have long existed orders of clergy below that of deacon.  In the Eastern Orthodox and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches (and, until 1970, in the Roman Catholic Church), a person has to be [[tonsure]]d a cleric and be ordained to sundry [[minor order]]s prior to being ordained a deacon.  Although a person may be said to be ordained to these orders, such ordinations are not reckoned as part of the sacrament of Holy Orders; in the Eastern Orthodox, the term ''[[Cheirothesia]]'' ("imposition of hands")&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; is used for such ordinations in contrast to ''Cheirotonia'' ("laying on of hands") for ordinations of deacons, presbyters, and bishops.
* The following are positions that are not acquired by ordination:
** Becoming a [[monk]] or [[nun]] or, generally, a member of a [[religious order#Christian tradition|religious order]], which is open to men and women; men in religious orders may or may not be ordained. Anglican nuns may, like their male counterparts, be ordained as well. 
** Offices and titles such as [[pope]], [[patriarch]], [[archbishop]], [[archpriest]], [[archimandrite]], [[archdeacon]], etc., which are given to ordained persons for sundry reasons, e.g., to rank them or honor them.
** [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s are simply a large collegiate body who are electors of and the senior-most counselors to the Pope, and are not a fourth order beyond bishop. At presently nearly all cardinals are bishops, although [[Cardinal (Catholicism)#Cardinals who are not bishops|several are priests]], having been granted a dispensation from being ordained a bishop by the Pope (most of these were elevated by the Pope for services to the Church, and are over 80, thus not having the right to elect a pope or have active voting memberships in Vatican departments). As recently as 1899 there was a [[lay cardinal|cardinal who was a deacon]] when he died, having been a cardinal for 41 years ([[Teodolfo Mertel]]). There have even been noble lay men, or men who only possessed minor orders (now called ministries, and carried out by seminarians and laypeople) who at one time were made cardinals. Cardinals are considered princes in diplomatic protocol and by the Church, and even if they are not ordained bishops and cannot perform episcopal functions such as ordination, they have both real and ceremonial precedence over all non-cardinal patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops. Some have discussed the possibility in Catholicism of having women serve as cardinals or, more realistically in the short-term, as sub-deacons, since they cannot be ordained{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}.
*{{anchor|DDO}}In the [[Church of England]], the priest of the diocese who oversees the process of discernment, selection and training of ordinands is usually called the "Diocesan Director of Ordinands", commonly shortened to "DDO".

===Protestantism===
[[Image:Presbyterian licentiate making his vows.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Presbyterian]] ordinand making his ordination vows.]]

In most [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, ordination to the pastoral office is the rite by which their various churches:
* recognize and confirm that an individual has been called by God to ministry,
* acknowledges that the individual has gone through a period of discernment and training related to this call, and
* authorizes that individual to take on the office of [[Minister of religion|ministry]].
For the sake of authorization and church order, and not for reason of 'powers' or 'ability', individuals in most [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches must be ordained in order to preside at the sacraments ([[Baptism]], [[Confession in the Lutheran Church|Holy Absolution]] and [[Holy Communion]]), and to be installed as a called [[pastor]] of a congregation or parish.

Some Protestant traditions have additional offices of ministry to which persons can be ordained.  For instance:
* most [[Presbyterian]] and [[Reformed]] churches maintain a threefold order of ministry of [[pastor]], [[Elder (religious)|elder]], and [[deacon]].  The order of Pastor, the only one of the three orders considered "clergy", is comparable to most other denominations' pastoral office or ordained ministry.  The order of [[Elder (religious)|elder]] comprises lay persons ordained to the ministries of church order and spiritual care (for example, elders form the governing bodies of congregations and are responsible for a congregation's worship life).  The order of [[deacon]] comprises lay persons ordained to ministries of service and pastoral care.
* in the [[Methodist]] tradition, [[deacon]]s are also ordained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nat.uca.org.au/TD/worship/Orders_of_Service/ordination_mow.doc Order of Service: Ordination of a Deacon and Ordination of a Minister of the Word] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626050010/http://nat.uca.org.au/TD/worship/Orders_of_Service/ordination_mow.doc |date=2008-06-26 }}, [[Uniting Church in Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For most Protestant denominations that have an office of [[bishop]], such as Lutheranism and Methodism, this is not viewed as a separate ordination or order of ministry.  Rather, bishops are [[ordained minister]]s of the same order as other pastors, simply having been "consecrated" or installed into the "office" (that is, the job) of bishop.  However, some [[Lutheran]] churches also claim valid [[apostolic succession]].&lt;ref&gt;Tjørhom, Ola. "The Church and its Apostolicity: The Porvoo Common Statement as a Challenge to Lutheran Ecclesiology and the Nordic Lutheran Churches." ''The Ecumenical Review'' 52.2 (2000): 195-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Protestant Churches &amp;ndash; especially Pentecostal and Charismatic ones &amp;ndash; also have an informal tier of ministers. Those who graduate from a Bible College or take a year of prescribed courses are licensed ministers. Two more years of courses or graduation from a seminary or theological graduate school, as well as an exam by senior ministers, will result in one becoming an ordained minister. Licensed ministers are addressed as "Minister" and ordained ministers as "Reverend."

===Non-denominational===
In Christianity, the term non-denominational refers to those churches that have not formally aligned themselves with an established denomination, or remain otherwise officially autonomous. This, however, does not preclude an identifiable standard among such congregations. Non-denominational congregations may establish a functional denomination by means of mutual recognition of or accountability to other congregations and leaders with commonly held doctrine, policy and worship without formalizing external direction or oversight in such matters. Some non-denominational churches explicitly reject the idea of a formalized denominational structure as a matter of principle, holding that each congregation must be autonomous.

Non-denominational is generally used to refer to one of two forms of independence: political or theological. That is, the independence may come about because of a religious disagreement or political disagreement. This causes some confusion in understanding. Some churches say they are non-denominational because they have no central headquarters (though they may have affiliations with other congregations.) Other churches say they are non-denominational because their belief structures are unique.

Members of non-denominational churches often consider themselves simply "Christians". However, the acceptance of any particular stance on a doctrine or practice (for example, on baptism), about which there is not general unanimity among churches or professing Christians, may be said to establish a de facto credal identity. In essence, this would mean that each non-denominational church forms its own unofficial "denomination" with a specific set of tenets as defined by the beliefs and practices of its own congregation.

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
Jehovah's Witnesses consider an adherent's [[Baptism#Jehovah's Witnesses|baptism]] to constitute ordination as a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]].&lt;ref&gt;"Beliefs—Membership and Organization", ''Authorized Site of the Office of Public Information of Jehovah's Witnesses'', [http://jw-media.org/beliefs/membership.htm As Retrieved 2009-09-01] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826010609/http://www.jw-media.org/beliefs/membership.htm |date=2012-08-26 }}, "Jehovah's Witnesses have no clergy-laity division. All baptized members are ordained ministers"&lt;/ref&gt; Governments have generally recognized that Jehovah's Witnesses' full-time appointees (such as their "[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Regular pioneers|regular pioneers]]") qualify as ministers&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case [[Dickinson v.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{main|Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}
In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], a rite of ordination is performed to bestow either the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] or [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] (Hebrews 5:4–6) upon a worthy male member. As in the Anglican, Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions, great care is taken to assure that the candidate for priesthood is ordained by those with proper authority and ordained properly and validly; thorough records of priesthood ordination are kept by the church. Ordination is performed by the [[laying on of hands]]. Ordination to the office of [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]] in the Aaronic priesthood gives the ordained person the authority to:
* baptize converts and children over the age of 8 into the church
* bless and administer the [[Sacrament (LDS Church)|sacrament]] (the Lord's Supper)
* participate in, or perform, ordinations of others to the Aaronic Priesthood or its offices
* collect [[fast offerings]] for the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Bishop]] (usually ordained [[Deacon (Latter Day Saints)|Deacons]] and [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|Teachers]] perform this)

Ordination to the Melchizedek priesthood includes the authority to perform all the duties of the Aaronic priesthood, as well as ordain others to the Melchizedek or Aaronic priesthood, perform [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|confirmations]], bless and anoint the sick with oil, bless and dedicate graves, and other such rites. There are five offices within the Melchizedek Priesthood to which one could potentially be ordained:
* [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]]
* [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|High Priest]]
* [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|Patriarch]]
* [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Seventy]]
* [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]]
"Ordination to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood is done by or under the direction of the bishop or branch president. Ordination to an office in the Melchizedek Priesthood is done by or under the direction of the stake or mission president. To perform a priesthood ordination, one or more authorized priesthood holders place their hands lightly on the person’s head."&lt;ref&gt;''Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood'' Part B Lesson 5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Latter-day Saints believe in a line of priesthood authority that traces back to Jesus Christ and his [[apostles]].  LDS adherents believe the church's founder, [[Joseph Smith]], was ordained under the hands of apostles [[St. Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], who appeared to Smith as angelic messengers in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood?lang=eng&amp;letter=m |title=Melchizedek Priesthood |work=[[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|Bible Dictionary]], [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] |publisher=LDS Church |year=1979 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828221026/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/melchizedek-priesthood?lang=eng&amp;letter=m |archivedate=August 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Women as imams}}

Muslims do not formally ordain religious leaders. Ordination is viewed as a distinct aspect of other religions and is rejected. Islam does not have a formal and separated clergy.

Religious leaders are usually called [[Imam]]s or [[Sheikh]]s or [[Mawlānā|Maulana]]. The title Imam (when used outside the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|historic Shi'ite context]]) refers to someone who leads in prayer and can also be used in a linguistic sense for anyone who leads other Muslims in congregational prayers. Sheikh is an Arabic word meaning "old man" and is used as an honorable title for a learned man; Shaikhah refers to a woman learned in Islamic issues. This title is usually more prevalent in the Arabic countries. The word Maulana is a title bestowed upon students who have graduated from a [[Madrasa]] (Islamic theological school) throughout the Indian subcontinent region. Although different Muslim schools, universities or madrasas might follow different graduation ceremonies upon a student's completion of a 4-year B.A. of Islamic Studies or a 7–8 Alim Course, these ceremonies do not in any way symbolize ordination.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Semikhah}}

''[[Semikhah]]'' ({{lang-he|סמיכה}}, "leaning [of the hands]"), also ''semichut'' ({{lang-he|סמיכות}}, "ordination"), or ''semicha lerabanim'' ({{lang-he|סמיכה לרבנות}}, "rabbinical ordination") is derived from a Hebrew word which means to "rely on" or "to be authorized". It generally refers to the ordination of a [[rabbi]] or [[hazzan]] within [[Judaism]]. While the Hebrew word ''semikhah'' is rendered as "ordination" in English, a rabbi is a teacher of [[Torah]], not [[Priest (Judaism)|a priest]]. For example, for many religious purposes such as prayer a [[minyan]] (quorum) of ten people (men or adults in different streams of Judaism) is both necessary and sufficient; it is said that "nine rabbis do not constitute a minyan, but ten cobblers can"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templewb.org/Chronicle/Volume09_Issue01.pdf|title=Temple Israel Chrnicle, January 2009, p3|author=|date=|website=templewb.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101030/http://www.templewb.org/Chronicle/Volume09_Issue01.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;—the presence of a rabbi is not necessary.

==Unitarian Universalism==
As [[Unitarian Universalism]] features very few doctrinal thresholds for prospective congregation members, ordinations of UU ministers are considerably less focused upon doctrinal adherence than upon factors such as possessing a [[Masters of Divinity]] degree from an accredited higher institution of education and an ability to articulate an understanding of ethics, spirituality and humanity.

In the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]], candidates for "ministerial fellowship" are approved by Ministerial Fellowship Committee (MFC). However, individual congregations of the UUA possess final voting rights on ordination of ministers, and congregations may sometimes even hire or ordain ministers who have not received ministerial fellowship.

==Wicca==

In the [[Neo-Pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]], a person's [[initiation]] is regarded as an induction and ordination as a [[wikt:priestess|priestess]] or [[priest]].  The rites which a person undergoes to become a priestess or priest, and the education and years of study required differ according to denomination.

==Ordination of women==
{{Main|Ordination of women}}

The ordination of women is often a controversial issue in religions where either the office of ordination, or the role that an ordained person fulfills, is traditionally restricted to men, for various theological reasons.

=== In Christianity ===
{{Main|Ordination of women#Christianity}}
The Christian priesthood has traditionally been reserved to men. Some{{Who|date=May 2013}} claim that women were ordained deacons in the first millennium of Christianity, but their claims are disputed. After the Protestant Reformation and the loosening of authority structures within many denominations, most Protestant groups re-envisioned the role of the ordained priesthood.  Many did away with it altogether.  Others altered it in fundamental ways, often favoring a rabbinical-type married minister of teaching (word) and discarding any notion of a sacrificial priesthood.  A common epithet used by Protestants (especially Anglicans) against Catholics was that Catholics were a 'priest-ridden' people.  Hatred for priests was a common element of [[anti-Catholicism]] and pogroms against Catholics focused on expelling, killing, or forcefully 'laicizing' priests.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Beginning in the twentieth century, many Protestant denominations began re-evaluating the roles of women in their churches. Many now ordain women.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} A woman named Deborah was a judge of the ancient [[Israelites]] according to the biblical book of [[Book of Judges|Judges]]. Based partially upon this precedent, other Protestant and non-denominational organizations grant ordination to women. Other denominations refute the claim of a precedent based on Deborah's example because she is not specifically described as ruling over Israel, rather giving judgments on contentious issues in private, not teaching publicly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+4;&amp;version=47|title=Bible Gateway passage: Judges 4 - English Standard Version|author=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521154908/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%204|archivedate=21 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither did she lead the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+4;&amp;version=47|title=Bible Gateway passage: Judges 4 - English Standard Version|author=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521154908/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%204|archivedate=21 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grudem | first = Wayne | authorlink = Wayne Grudem | title = Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth: An Analysis of more than 100 Disputed Questions | publisher = Multnomah Publishers, Inc. | year = 2004 | location = Sisters, Oregon | page = 864 | url = http://www.efbt100.com/index.php | archive-url = https://archive.is/20070703234757/http://www.efbt100.com/index.php | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-07-03 | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 1-57673-840-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her message to her fellow judge Barak in fact affirmed the male leadership of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+4;&amp;version=47|title=Bible Gateway passage: Judges 4 - English Standard Version|author=|date=|website=Bible Gateway|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521154908/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%204|archivedate=21 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[United Church of Canada]] has ordained women since 1932. The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] ordains women as pastors, and women are eligible for election as bishops. [[The Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] ordains women as deacons, priests and bishops. [[The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church]] ordains women at all levels including deacon, priest and bishop. Other denominations leave the decision to ordain women to the regional governing body, or even to the congregation itself; these include the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]] and the [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States)|Evangelical Presbyterian Church]].  The ordination of women in the latter half of the 20th century was an important issue between Anglicans and Catholics since the Catholic Church viewed the ordination of women as a huge obstacle to possible rapprochement between the two churches.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The Catholic Church has not changed its view or practice on the ordination or women, and neither have any of the Orthodox churches; these churches represent approximately 65% of all Christians worldwide. In response to the growing call for the ordination of women, Pope John Paul II issued the statement ''[[Ordinatio Sacerdotalis]]'' in 1995. In it, he gave reasons why women cannot be ordained, and defined that the Holy Spirit had not conferred the power to ordain women upon the Church. In the wake of this definitive statement, many theologians considered the issue settled, but many continue to push for the ordination of women in the Catholic Church. Some have even begun protest churches.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== In Judaism ===
{{Main|Women in Judaism}} 
Policy regarding the ordination of women differs among the different [[denominations of Judaism]]. Most Orthodox congregations do not allow female rabbis, while more liberal congregations began allowing female rabbis by the middle of the twentieth century.

==Ordination of homosexual, bisexual and transgender people==
{{main|Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy}}
Most [[Abrahamic religion]]s condemn [[homosexuality]]; only recently have a minority of denominational or non-denominational sects of Christianity and Judaism endorsed the ordination of openly [[LGBT]] people.

The United Church of Christ ordained openly gay Bill Johnson in 1972, and lesbian Anne Holmes in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us/old-firsts.html|title=UCC 'Firsts'|author=|date=|website=www.ucc.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115110128/http://www.ucc.org/about-us/old-firsts.html|archivedate=15 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Buddhist ordinations of openly LGBT monks have occurred, more notable ordinations of openly LGBT [[novitiate]]s have taken place in Western Buddhism.

'''Pedro Luís Pereira de Sousa''' (December 13, 1839 – July 16, 1884) was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, politician, orator and lawyer, adept of the "[[Condorism|Condorist]]" movement. He is the patron of the 31st chair of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras|Brazilian Academy of Letters]].

==Life==
Pedro Luís was born in [[Araruama]], in 1839. He made his primary studies in the Instituto Freeze, in [[Nova Friburgo]], where he met [[Casimiro de Abreu]]. Graduated in [[Law]] in the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo]] in 1860, he established himself as a lawyer in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. A deputy between 1864–1866 and 1878–1881, he would also become minister of Foreign Affairs in 1880 and the governor of [[Bahia]] in 1882. Among many others, he was decorated with the [[Order of the Rose]].

He died in 1884.

==Works==
* ''Terribilis Dea'' ([[1860 in literature|1860]])
* ''Os Voluntários da Morte'' ([[1864 in literature|1864]])
* ''A Sombra de Tiradentes e Nunes Machado'' ([[1866 in literature|1866]])
* ''Prisca Fides'' ([[1876 in literature|1876]])

==Trivia==
* He was the uncle of former [[President of Brazil|Brazilian president]] [[Washington Luís]].
* His major work, ''Terribilis Dea'', heavily influenced [[Castro Alves]], who wrote a poem based on it, named "Deusa incruenta".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Phonetotopy''' is the concept that articulatory features as well as perceptual features of speech sounds are ordered in the brain in a similar way as tone ([[tonotopy]]), articulation and its somatosensory feedback ([[somatotopy]]), or visual location of an object ([[retinotopy]]). It is assumed that a phonetotopic ordering of speech sounds as well as of syllables can be found at a ''supramodal'' speech processing level (i.e. at a ''phonetic'' speech processing level) within the brain.

The concept of '''phonetotopy''' was introduced in Kröger et al. (2009) on the basis of modeling speech production, speech perception, as well as speech acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Kröger BJ, Kannampuzha J, Lowit A, Neuschaefer-Rube C (2009) Phonetotopy within a neurocomputational model of speech production and speech acquisition. In: Fuchs S, Loevenbruck H, Pape D, Perrier P (eds.) Some aspects of speech and the brain.

Bouchard KE, Mesgarani N, Johnson K, Chang EF (2013) Functional organization of human sensorimotor cortex for speech articulation. Nature 495, 327–332&lt;/ref&gt; support this concept.

The concept of '''phonetotopy''' at least underpins the concept of [[distinctive features]], which are phonetically based features of speech sounds (i.e. based in perceptual as well as in articulatory domain), but which as well are linguistically (or [[Phonology|phonologically]]) relevant, and thus are realized in a language specific way in humans.

{{See also|History of Proto-Slavic|History of the Slavic languages}}
'''Proto-Slavic''' is the [[Attested language|unattested]], [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[proto-language]] of all the [[Slavic languages]]. It represents Slavic speech approximately from the 5th to 9th centuries AD.{{contradiction inline|reason=The periodisation below suggests a time spanning from 1000 BC or earlier, or AD 300, to AD 600 or 1000}} As with most other proto-languages, no attested writings have been found; scholars have reconstructed the language by applying the [[comparative method]] to all the attested Slavic languages and by taking into account other [[Indo-European languages]].

Rapid development of Slavic speech occurred during the Proto-Slavic period, coinciding with the massive expansion of the Slavic-speaking area. Dialectal differentiation occurred early on during this period, but overall linguistic unity and [[mutual intelligibility]] continued for several centuries, into the 10th century or later. During this period, many sound changes diffused across the entire area, often uniformly. This makes it inconvenient to maintain the traditional definition of a [[proto-language]] as the ''latest reconstructable common ancestor'' of a language group, with no dialectal differentiation. (This would necessitate treating all pan-Slavic changes after the 6th century or so as part of the separate histories of the various daughter languages.) Instead, [[Slavicist]]s typically handle the entire period of dialectally-differentiated linguistic unity as '''Common Slavic'''.

One can divide the Proto-Slavic/Common-Slavic time of linguistic unity roughly into three periods:

* an early period with little or no dialectal variation
* a middle period of slight-to-moderate dialectal variation
* a late period of significant variation

Authorities differ as to which periods should be included in Proto-Slavic and in Common Slavic. The language described in this article generally reflects the middle period, usually termed ''Late Proto-Slavic'' (sometimes ''Middle Common Slavic''{{sfn|Lunt|1987}}) and often dated to around the 7th to 8th centuries. This language remains largely unattested, but a late-period variant, representing the late 9th-century dialect spoken around [[Thessaloniki]] in [[Greek Macedonia]], is attested in [[Old Church Slavonic]] manuscripts.

==Introduction==
The ancestor of Proto-Slavic is [[Proto-Balto-Slavic]], which is also the ancestor of the [[Baltic languages]], e.g. [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]].  This language in turn is descended from [[Proto-Indo-European]], the parent language of the vast majority of [[European languages]] (including [[English language|English]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], etc.). Proto-Slavic gradually evolved into the various Slavic languages during the latter half of the first millennium AD, concurrent with the explosive growth of the Slavic-speaking area.

There is no scholarly consensus concerning either the number of stages involved in the development of the language (its [[periodization]]) or the terms used to describe them.  For consistency and convenience, this article adopts the following scheme{{printworthy selfref|&amp;#32;(as does the article [[History of the Slavic languages]], which see for further discussion of the historical and linguistic development of Proto-Slavic from Proto-Balto-Slavic, and the further development of Proto-Slavic into the modern Slavic languages)}}.

Proto-Slavic is divided into periods. One division is made up of three periods:&lt;ref name="Kliachko1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Savel Kliachko|title=The sharpness feature in Slavic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sJ1CAAAAIAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Dept. of Slavic Languages and Literatures|p=57|quote=Its immediate successors were Proto-East Slavic, Proto-South Slavic, and Proto-West Slavic. The Proto-Slavic era itself is often divided arbitrarily into three periods: (1) early Proto-Slavic, until about 1000 B.C.; (2) middle Proto-Slavic, during the next millenium; (3) late Proto-Slavic, from the 1st to the 6th century A.D., although it was not until the 12th century that Slavic linguistic unity actually ceased to function.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early Proto-Slavic (until 1000&amp;nbsp;BC)
*Middle Proto-Slavic (1000&amp;nbsp;BC – AD&amp;nbsp;1)
*Late Proto-Slavic (AD&amp;nbsp;1–600)

Another division is made up of four periods:{{cn|date=June 2016}}
# ''Pre-Slavic'' ({{circa}} 1500&amp;nbsp;BC – AD&amp;nbsp;300): A long, stable period of gradual development. The most significant phonological developments during this period involved the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic system]], e.g. [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and other [[Register (phonology)|register]] distinctions on syllables.
# ''Early Common Slavic'' or simply ''Early Slavic'' ({{circa}} 300–600): The early, uniform stage of Common Slavic, but also the beginning of a longer period of rapid phonological change. As there are no dialectal distinctions reconstructible from this period or earlier, this is the period for which a single common ancestor (that is, "Proto-Slavic proper") can be reconstructed.
# ''Middle Common Slavic'' ({{circa}} 600–800): The stage with the earliest identifiable dialectal distinctions.  Rapid phonological change continued, although with the massive expansion of the Slavic-speaking area. Although some dialectal variation did exist, most sound changes were still uniform and consistent in their application. By the end of this stage, the vowel and consonant phonemes of the language were largely the same as those still found in the modern languages.  For this reason, reconstructed "Proto-Slavic" forms commonly found in scholarly works and etymological dictionaries normally correspond to this period. 
# ''Late Common Slavic'' ({{circa}} 800–1000, although perhaps through {{circa}} 1150 in [[Kievan Rus']], in the far northeast): The last stage in which the whole Slavic-speaking area still functioned as a single language, with sound changes normally propagating throughout the entire area, although often with significant dialectal variation in the details.

This article considers primarily ''Middle Common Slavic'', noting when there is slight dialectal variation. It also covers ''Late Common Slavic'' when there are significant developments that are shared (more or less) identically among all Slavic languages.

==Notation==
{{hatnote|See [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language#Notation]] for more detail on the most common diacritics for indicating [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] ''{{angbr|á à â ã ȁ a̋ ā ă}}'' and various other phonetic distinctions ''{{angbr|ą ẹ ė š ś}}'', etc. in Balto-Slavic languages.}}

===Vowel notation===
Two different and conflicting systems for denoting vowels are commonly in use in Indo-European and Balto-Slavic linguistics on one hand, and Slavic linguistics on the other. In the first, vowel length is consistently distinguished with a macron above the letter, while in the latter it is not clearly indicated. The following table explains these differences:

{| class="wikitable"
! Vowel
! IE/B-S
! Slavic
|-
| Short close front vowel (front [[yer]])
| i
| ĭ or ь
|-
| Short close back vowel (back [[yer]])
| u
| ŭ or ъ
|-
| Short open back vowel
| a
| o
|-
| Long close front vowel
| ī
| i
|-
| Long close back vowel
| ū
| y
|-
| Long open front vowel ([[yat]])
| ē
| ě
|-
| Long open back vowel
| ā
| a
|}

For consistency, all discussions of words in Early Slavic and before (the boundary corresponding roughly to the monophthongization of diphthongs, and the [[Slavic second palatalization]]) use the common Balto-Slavic notation of vowels. Discussions of Middle and Late Common Slavic, as well as later dialects, use the Slavic notation.

===Other vowel and consonant diacritics===
* The [[haček]] on consonants {{Angbr|č ď ľ ň ř š ť ž}} is used in this article to denote the consonants that result from ''iotation'' (coalescence with a {{IPA|/j/}} that previously followed the consonant) and the [[Slavic first palatalization]]. This use is based on the [[Czech alphabet]], and is shared by most Slavic languages and linguistic explanations about Slavic.
* The acute accent on the consonant {{angbr|ś}} indicates a special, more frontal "hissing" sound. The acute is used in several other Slavic languages (such as Polish, Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian) to denote a similar "frontal" quality to a consonant.
* The [[ogonek]] {{Angbr|ę ǫ}}, indicates vowel [[nasalization]].

===Prosodic notation===
For Middle and Late Common Slavic, the following marks are used to indicate tone and length distinctions on vowels, based on the standard notation in [[Serbo-Croatian]]:
* Acute accent {{Angbr|á}}: A '''long rising''' accent, originating from the Balto-Slavic "acute" accent. This occurred in the Middle Common Slavic period and earlier.
* Grave accent {{Angbr|à}}: A '''short rising''' accent. It occurred from Late Common Slavic onwards, and developed from the shortening of the original acute (long rising) tone.
* Inverted breve {{Angbr|ȃ}}: A '''long falling''' accent, originating from the Balto-Slavic "circumflex" accent. In Late Common Slavic, originally short (falling) vowels were lengthened in monosyllables under some circumstances, and are also written with this mark. This secondary circumflex occurs only on the original short vowels ''e, o, ь, ъ'' in an [[open syllable]] (i.e. when not forming part of a [[liquid diphthong]]).
* Double grave accent {{Angbr|ȁ}}: A '''short falling''' accent. It corresponds to the Balto-Slavic "short" accent. All short vowels that were not followed by a sonorant consonant originally carried this accent, until some were lengthened (see preceding item).
* Tilde {{Angbr|ã}}: Usually a '''long rising''' accent. This indicates the Late Common Slavic "neoacute" accent, which was usually long, but short when occurring on some syllables types in certain languages. It resulted from retraction of the accent (movement towards an earlier syllable) under certain circumstances, often when the Middle Common Slavic accent fell on a word-final final [[yer]] (*ь/ĭ or *ъ/ŭ).
* Macron {{Angbr|ā}}: A '''long''' vowel with no distinctive tone. In Middle Common Slavic, vowel length was an implicit part of the vowel (*e, *o, *ь, *ъ are inherently short, all others are inherently long), so this is usually redundant for Middle Common Slavic words. However, it became distinctive in Late Common Slavic after several shortenings and lengthenings had occurred.

===Other prosodic diacritics===
There are unfortunately multiple competing systems used to indicate prosody in different Balto-Slavic languages (see [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language#Notation]] for more details).  The most important for this article are:
# Three-way system of Proto-Slavic, Proto-Balto-Slavic, modern Lithuanian: Acute tone {{Angbr|á}} vs. circumflex tone {{Angbr|ȃ}} or {{Angbr|ã}} vs. short accent {{Angbr|à}}.
# Four-way Serbo-Croatian system, also used in Slovenian and often in Slavic reconstructions: long rising {{Angbr|á}}, short rising {{Angbr|à}}, long falling {{Angbr|ȃ}}, short falling {{Angbr|ȁ}}. In the [[Chakavian]] dialect and other archaic dialects, the long rising accent is notated with a tilde {{Angbr|ã}}, indicating its normal origin in the Late Common Slavic neoacute accent (see above).
# Length only, as in Czech and Slovak: long {{Angbr|á}} vs. short {{Angbr|a}}.
# Stress only, as in Ukrainian, Russian and Bulgarian: stressed {{Angbr|á}} vs. unstressed {{Angbr|a}}.

The columns marked "central" and "back" may alternatively be interpreted as "back unrounded" and "back rounded" respectively, but rounding of back vowels was distinctive only between the vowels *y and *u. The other back vowels had optional non-distinctive rounding. Thus:

The vowels described as "short" and "long" were simultaneously distinguished by length and quality in Middle Common Slavic. Vowel length evolved as follows:
#In the Early Slavic period, length was the primary distinction (as indicated, for example, by Greek transcriptions of Slavic words, or early loanwords from Slavic into the [[Finnic languages]]).
#In the Middle Common Slavic period, all long/short vowel pairs also assumed distinct qualities, as indicated above.
#During the Late Common Slavic period, various lengthenings and shortenings occurred, creating new long counterparts of originally short vowels, and short counterparts of originally long vowels (e.g. long *o, short *a). The short close vowels *ь/ĭ and *ъ/ŭ were either lost or lowered to mid vowels, leaving the originally long high vowels *i, *y and *u with non-distinctive length. As a result, vowel quality became the primary distinction among the vowels, while length became conditioned by accent and other properties and was not a lexical property inherent in each vowel.
#Many modern Slavic languages have since lost all length distinctions.

Some authors avoid the terms "short" and "long", using "lax" and "tense" instead.{{sfn|Lunt|2001|p=192}}

The phonetic value (IPA symbol) of most consonants is the same as their traditional spelling. Some notes and exceptions:
* *c denotes a voiceless alveolar affricate {{IPA|[t͡s]}}. *dz was its voiced counterpart {{IPA|[d͡z]}}.
* *š and *ž were postalveolar {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}}.
* *č and *dž were postalveolar affricates, {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}}, although the latter only occurred in the combination *ždž and had developed into *ž elsewhere.
* The pronunciation of *ť and *ď is not precisely known, though it is likely that they were held longer (geminate). They may have been palatalized dentals {{IPA|[tʲː dʲː]}}, or perhaps true palatal {{IPA|[cː ɟː]}} as in modern Macedonian.
* The exact value of *ś is also unknown but usually presumed to be {{IPA|[ɕ]}} or {{IPA|[sʲ]}}. It was rare, only occurring before front vowels from the second palatalization of *x, and it merged with *š in West Slavic and *s in the other branches.
* *v was a labial approximant {{IPA|[ʋ]}}. It may have had bilabial {{IPA|[w]}} as an allophone in certain positions (as in modern Slovene and Ukrainian).
* *l was {{IPA|[l]}}. Before back vowels, it was probably fairly strongly velarized {{IPA|[ɫ]}} in many dialects.
* The sonorants *ľ *ň were either palatalized {{IPA|[lʲ nʲ]}} or true palatal {{IPA|[ʎ ɲ]}}.
* The pronunciation of *ř is not precisely known, but it was approximately a palatalized trill {{IPA|[rʲ]}}. In all daughter languages except Slovenian it either merged with *r (Southwest Slavic) or with the palatalized *rʲ resulting from *r before front vowels (elsewhere). The resulting *rʲ merged back into *r in some languages, but remained distinct in Czech (becoming a [[fricative trill]], denoted {{angbr|ř}} in spelling), in [[Old Polish]] (it subsequently merged with *ž {{angbr|ż}} but continues to be spelled {{angbr|rz}}, although some dialects have kept a distinction to this day, specially among the elderly&lt;ref name="frykatywner"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.gwarypolskie.uw.edu.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=218&amp;Itemid=58 |title=Gwary polskie - Frykatywne rż (ř) |publisher=Gwarypolskie.uw.edu.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), in Russian (except when preceding a consonant), and in Bulgarian (when preceding a vowel).

In most dialects, non-distinctive palatalization was probably present on all consonants that occurred before front vowels. When the high front yer *ь/ĭ was lost in many words, it left this palatalization as a "residue", which then became distinctive, producing a phonemic distinction between palatalized and non-palatalized alveolars and labials. In the process, the palatal sonorants *ľ *ň *ř merged with alveolar *l *n *r before front vowels, with both becoming *lʲ *nʲ *rʲ. Subsequently, some palatalized consonants lost their palatalization in some environments, merging with their non-palatal counterparts. This happened the least in Russian and the most in Czech. Palatalized consonants never developed in Southwest Slavic (modern Croatian, Serbian, and Slovenian), and the merger of *ľ *ň *ř with *l *n *r did not happen before front vowels (although Serbian and Croatian later merged *ř with *r).

=== Pitch accent ===
As in its ancestors, Proto-Balto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European, one syllable of each Common Slavic word was accented (carried more prominence). The placement of the accent was free and thus phonemic; it could occur on any syllable and its placement was inherently part of the word. The accent could also be either mobile or fixed, meaning that inflected forms of a word could have the accent on different syllables depending on the ending, or always on the same syllable.

Common Slavic vowels also had a [[pitch accent]]. In Middle Common Slavic, all accented long vowels, nasal vowels and liquid diphthongs had a distinction between two pitch accents, traditionally called "acute" and "circumflex" accent. The acute accent was pronounced with rising intonation, while the circumflex accent had a falling intonation. Short vowels (*e *o *ь *ъ) had no pitch distinction, and were always pronounced with falling intonation. Unaccented (unstressed) vowels never had tonal distinctions, but could still have length distinctions. These rules are similar to the restrictions that apply to the pitch accent in [[Slovene language|Slovene]].

In the Late Common Slavic period, several sound changes occurred. Long vowels bearing the acute (long rising) accent were usually shortened, resulting in a short rising intonation. Some short vowels were lengthened, creating new long falling vowels. A third type of pitch accent developed, known as the "neoacute", as a result of [[sound law]]s that retracted the accent (moved it to the preceding syllable). This occurred at a time when the Slavic-speaking area was already dialectally differentiated, and usually syllables with the acute and/or circumflex accent were shortened around the same time. Hence it is unclear whether there was ever a period in any dialect when there were three phonemically distinct pitch accents on long vowels. Nevertheless, taken together, these changes significantly altered the distribution of the pitch accents and vowel length, to the point that by the end of the Late Common Slavic period almost any vowel could be short or long, and almost any accented vowel could have falling or rising pitch.

=== Phonotactics ===
Most syllables in Middle Common Slavic were [[open syllable|open]]. The only closed syllables were those that ended in a liquid (*l or *r), forming [[liquid diphthong]]s, and in such syllables, the preceding vowel had to be short. [[Consonant cluster]]s were permitted, but only at the beginning of a syllable. Such a cluster was syllabified with the cluster entirely in the following syllable, contrary to the syllabification rules that are known to apply to most languages. For example, {{wt|sla-pro|*bogatьstvo}} "wealth" was divided into syllables as *bo-ga-tь-stvo, with the whole cluster *-stv- at the beginning of the syllable.

By the beginning of the Late Common Slavic period, all or nearly all syllables had become open as a result of [[Slavic liquid metathesis and pleophony|developments in the liquid diphthongs]]. Syllables with liquid diphthongs beginning with *o or *e had been converted into open syllables, for example *TorT became *TroT, *TraT or *ToroT in the various daughter languages. The main exception are the Northern [[Lechitic languages]] ([[Kashubian dialect|Kashubian]], extinct [[Slovincian language|Slovincian]] and [[Polabian language|Polabian]]) only with lengthening of the syllable and no metathesis (*TarT, e.g. PSl. {{wt|sla-pro|*gordъ}} &gt; Kashubian ''gard''; &gt; Polabian ''*gard'' &gt; ''gord''). In West Slavic and South Slavic, liquid diphthongs beginning with *ь or *ъ had likewise been converted into open syllables by converting the following liquid into a [[syllabic sonorant]] (palatal or non-palatal according to whether *ь or *ъ preceded respectively).{{sfn|Schenker|2002|p=75}} This left no closed syllables at all in these languages. The South Slavic languages, as well as Czech and Slovak, tended to preserve the syllabic sonorants, but in the Lechitic languages (such as Polish), they fell apart again into vowel-consonant or consonant-vowel combinations. In East Slavic, the liquid diphthongs in *ь or *ъ may have likewise become syllabic sonorants, but if so, the change was soon reversed, suggesting that it may never have happened in the first place.

==Grammar==
Proto-Slavic retained several of the grammatical categories inherited from Proto-Indo-European, especially in nominals (nouns and adjectives). Seven of the eight Indo-European cases had been retained (nominative, accusative, locative, genitive, dative, instrumental, vocative). The ablative had merged with the genitive. It also retained full use of the singular, [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] and plural numbers, and still maintained a distinction between masculine, feminine and neuter gender. However, verbs had become much more simplified, but displayed their own unique innovations.

===Alternations===

As a result of the three palatalizations and the fronting of vowels before palatal consonants, both consonant and vowel alternations were frequent in paradigms, as well as in word derivation.

The following table lists various consonant alternations that occurred in Proto-Slavic, as a result of various suffixes or endings being attached to stems:

* {{note|diphthong|1}} Originally formed a diphthong with the preceding vowel, which then became a long monophthong.

Vowels were fronted when following a palatal or "soft" consonant (*j, any iotated consonant, or a consonant that had been affected by the progressive palatalization). Because of this, most vowels occurred in pairs, depending on the preceding consonant.

|}

* The distinction between *ě₁ and *ě₂ is based on etymology and have different effects on a preceding consonant: *ě₁ triggers the first palatalization and then becomes *a, while *ě₂ triggers the second palatalization and does not change.
* Word-final *-un and *-in lost nasal and became *-u and *-i rather than forming a nasal vowel, so that nasal vowels formed medially only. This explains the double reflex.
* *ā and *an apparently did not take part in the fronting of back vowels, or in any case the effect was not visible. Both have the same reflex regardless of the preceding consonant.

Most word stems therefore became classed as either "soft" or "hard", depending on whether their endings used soft (fronted) vowels or the original hard vowels. Hard stems displayed consonant alternations before endings with front vowels as a result of the two regressive palatalizations and iotation.

As part of its Indo-European heritage, Proto-Slavic also retained [[ablaut]] alternations, although these had been reduced to unproductive relics. The following table lists the combinations (vowel softening may alter the outcomes).
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
|-

|}

Although qualitative alternations (e-grade versus o-grade versus zero grade) were no longer productive, the Balto-Slavic languages had innovated a new kind of ablaut, in which length was the primary distinction. This created two new alternation patterns, which did not exist in PIE: short *e, *o, *ь, *ъ versus long *ě, *a, *i, *y. This type of alternation may have still been productive in Proto-Slavic, as a way to form imperfective verbs from perfective ones.

===Nouns===
Most of the Proto-Indo-European declensional classes were retained. Some, such as u-stems and masculine i-stems, were gradually falling out of use and being replaced by other, more productive classes.

===Adjectives===
Adjective inflection had become more simplified compared to Proto-Indo-European. Only a single paradigm (in both hard and soft form) existed, descending from the PIE o- and a-stem inflection. I-stem and u-stem adjectives no longer existed. The present participle (from PIE *-nt-) still retained consonant stem endings.

Proto-Slavic had developed a distinction between "indefinite" and "definite" adjective inflection, much like Germanic strong and weak inflection. The definite inflection was used to refer to specific or known entities, similar to the use of the definite article "the" in English, while the indefinite inflection was unspecific or referred to unknown or arbitrary entities, like the English indefinite article "a". The indefinite inflection was identical to the inflection of o- and a-stem nouns, while the definite inflection was formed by suffixing the relative/anaphoric pronoun {{wt|sla-pro|*jь}} to the end of the normal inflectional endings. Both the adjective and the suffixed pronoun were presumably declined as separate words originally, but already within Proto-Slavic they had become contracted and fused to some extent.

===Verbs===
The Proto-Slavic system of verbal inflection was somewhat simplified from the verbal system of Proto-Indo-European (PIE), although it was still rich in tenses, conjugations and verb-forming suffixes.

====Grammatical categories====
The PIE mediopassive voice disappeared entirely except for the isolated form ''vědě'' "I know" in Old Church Slavonic (&lt; Late PIE *woid-ai, a perfect mediopassive formation). However, a new analytic mediopassive was formed using the reflexive particle {{wt|sla-pro|*sę}}, much as in the [[Romance languages]]. The imperative and subjunctive moods disappeared, while the old optative came to be used as the imperative instead.

In terms of PIE tense/aspect forms, the PIE imperfect was lost or merged with the PIE thematic aorist, and the PIE perfect was lost other than in the stem of the irregular verb {{wt|sla-pro|*věděti}} "to know" (from PIE *woyd-).  The aorist was retained, preserving the PIE thematic and sigmatic aorist types (the former is generally termed the ''root aorist'' in Slavic studies), and a new ''productive aorist'' arose from the sigmatic aorist by various analogical changes, e.g. replacing some of the original endings with thematic endings. (A similar development is observed in Greek and Sanskrit. In all three cases, the likely trigger was the phonological reduction of clusters like *-ss-, *-st- that arose when the original athematic endings were attached to the sigmatic *-s- affix.) A new synthetic imperfect was created by attaching a combination of the root and productive aorist endings to a stem suffix *-ěa- or *-aa-, of disputed origin. Various compound tenses were created, e.g. to express the future, conditional, perfect and pluperfect.

The three numbers (singular, dual and plural) were all maintained, as were the different athematic and thematic endings. Only five athematic verbs exist: {{wt|sla-pro|*věděti}} "to know", {{wt|sla-pro|*byti}} "to be", {{wt|sla-pro|*dati}} "to give", {{wt|sla-pro|*ěsti}} "to eat" and {{wt|sla-pro|*jьměti}} "to have". (*dati has a finite stem *dad-, suggesting derivation by some sort of reduplication.)  A new set of "semi-thematic" endings were formed by analogy (corresponding to modern conjugation class II), combining the thematic first singular ending with otherwise athematic endings. Proto-Slavic also maintained a large number of non-finite formations, including the infinitive, the supine, a verbal noun, and five participles (present active, present passive, past active, past passive and resultative). In large measure these directly continue PIE formations.

====Aspect====

Proto-Indo-European had an extensive system of aspectual distinctions ("present" vs. "aorist" vs. "perfect" in traditional terminology), found throughout the system. Proto-Slavic maintained part of this, distinguishing between aorist and imperfect in the past tense. In addition, Proto-Slavic evolved a means of forming [[lexical aspect]] (verbs inherently marked with a particular aspect) using various prefixes and suffixes, which was eventually extended into a systematic means of specifying grammatical aspect using pairs of related lexical verbs, each with the same meaning as the other but inherently marked as either imperfective (denoting an ongoing action) or perfective (denoting a completed action). The two sets of verbs interrelate in three primary ways:

#A suffix is added to a more basic perfective verb to form an imperfective verb.
#A prefix is added to a more basic imperfective verb (possibly the output of the previous step) to form a perfective verb. Often, multiple perfective verbs can be formed this way using different prefixes, one of which echoes the basic meaning of the source verb while the others add various shades of meaning (cf. English "write" vs. "write down" vs. "write up" vs. "write out").
#The two verbs are suppletive — either based on two entirely different roots, or derived from different PIE verb classes of the same root, often with root-vowel changes going back to PIE [[ablaut]] formations.

In Proto-Slavic and Old Church Slavonic, the old and new aspect systems coexisted, but the new aspect has gradually displaced the old one, and as a result most modern Slavic languages have lost the old imperfect, aorist, and most participles. A major exception, however, is Bulgarian (and also Macedonian to a fair extent), which has maintained both old and new systems and combined them to express fine shades of aspectual meaning. For example, in addition to imperfective imperfect forms and perfective aorist forms, Bulgarian can form a perfective imperfect (usually expressing a repeated series of completed actions considered subordinate to the "major" past actions) and an imperfective aorist (for "major" past events whose completion is not relevant to the narration).{{sfn|Scatton|2002|p=213}}

Proto-Slavic also had paired motion verbs (e.g. "run", "walk", "swim", "fly", but also "ride", "carry", "lead", "chase", etc.). One of the pair expresses ''determinate'' action (motion to a specified place, e.g. "I walked to my friend's house") and the other expressing ''indeterminate'' action (motion to and then back, and motion without a specified goal).  These pairs are generally related using either the suffixing or suppletive strategies of forming aspectual verbs. Each of the pair is also in fact a pair of perfective vs. imperfective verbs, where the perfective variant often uses a prefix ''*po-''.

====Conjugation====
Many different PIE verb classes were retained in Proto-Slavic, including (among others) simple thematic presents, presents in *-n- and *-y-, [[stative verb]]s in *-ē- (cf. similar verbs in the Latin ''-ēre'' conjugation), factitive verbs in *-ā- (cf. the Latin ''-āre'' conjugation), and o-grade causatives in *-éye-.

The forms of each verb were based on two basic stems, one for the present and one for the infinitive/past. The present stem was used before endings beginning in a vowel, the infinitive/past stem before endings beginning in a consonant. In Old Church Slavonic grammars, verbs are traditionally divided into four (or five) conjugation classes, depending on the present stem, known as [[August Leskien|Leskien]]'s verb classes. However, this division ignores the formation of the infinitive stem. The following table shows the main classes of verbs in Proto-Slavic, along with their traditional OCS conjugation classes. The "present" column shows the ending of the third person singular present.

===Accent classes===
{{See also|Proto-Slavic accent}}
Originally in Balto-Slavic, there were only two accent classes, ''barytonic'' (with fixed stem accent) and ''mobile'' (with mobile accent), corresponding to Slavic classes A and C. There was no class with fixed accent on the ending. Both classes originally had both acute and circumflex stems in them. After the operation of [[Dybo's law]], three basic accent classes emerged for nominals (nouns, adjectives, pronouns, participles):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Derksen|2008|p=8}}, echoing {{Harvnb|Stang|1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kortlandt|1994}}{{sfn|Kortlandt|2011}}

*Class A, with a fixed accent on the stem (either on the root or on a morphological suffix).
*Class B, with largely fixed accent on the ending (on the first syllable of the ending, if multisyllabic).
*Class C ("mobile"), with alternation of the accent between the first syllable of the stem and the ending, depending on the paradigmatic form.

For this purpose, the "stem" includes any morphological suffixes (e.g. a [[diminutive]] suffix), but not generally on the inflectional suffix that indicates the word class (e.g. the ''-ā-'' of feminine ''ā''-stem nouns), which is considered part of the ending. Verbs also had three accent classes (A, B and C) with similar characteristics to the corresponding noun classes. However, the situation is somewhat more complicated due to the large number of verb stem classes and the numerous forms in verbal paradigms.

Due to the way in which the accent classes arose, there are certain restrictions:

* In class A, the accented syllable always had the acute tone, and therefore was always long, because short syllables did not have tonal distinctions. Thus, single-syllable words with an originally short vowel (*''e'', *''o'', *''ь'', *''ъ'') in the stem could not belong to accent class A. If the stem was multisyllabic, the accent could potentially fall on any stem syllable (e.g. {{wt|sla-pro|językъ|*ję̄zū́k-}} "tongue"). These restrictions were caused by Dybo's law, which moved the accent one syllable to the right, but only in originally barytonic (stem-accented) nominals that did not have acute accent in the stem. Class A thus consists of the "leftover" words that Dybo's law did not affect.
* In class B, the stem syllable(s) could be either short or long.
* In class C, in forms where the accent fell on the stem and not the ending, that syllable was either circumflex or short accented, never acute accented. This is due to [[Meillet's law]], which converted an acute accent to a circumflex accent if it fell on the stem in class C nominals. Thus, Dybo's law did not affect nouns with a mobile accent paradigm. This is unlike Lithuanian, where [[Leskien's law]] (a law similar to Dybo's law) split both fixed and mobile paradigms in the same way, creating four classes.
* Consequently, circumflex or short accent on the first syllable could only occur in class C. In class A, it did not occur by definition, while in class B, the accent always shifted forward by Dybo's law.

Some nouns (especially ''jā''-stem nouns) fit into the class A pattern but have neoacute accent on the stem, which can have either a short or a long syllable. A standard example is {{wt|sla-pro|volja|*võľa}} "will", with neoacute accent on a short syllable. These nouns earlier belonged to class B; as a result, grammars may treat them as belonging either to classes A or B.

During the Late Common Slavic period, the class B paradigm became mobile as a result of a complex series of changes that moved the accent leftward in certain circumstances, producing a neoacute accent on the newly stressed syllable. The paradigms below reflect these changes. All languages subsequently simplified the class B paradigms to varying degrees; the older situation can often only be seen in certain nouns in certain languages, or indirectly by way of features such as the Slovene neo-circumflex tone that carry echoes of the time when this tone developed. See [[History of Proto-Slavic#Accentual developments]] for more details.

====Nouns====
{{See also|Proto-Balto-Slavic}}

The following tables are examples of Proto-Slavic noun-class paradigms, based on {{harvcoltxt|Verweij|1994}}. There were many changes in accentuation during the Common Slavic period, and there are significant differences in the views of different scholars on how these changes proceeded. As a result, these paradigms do not necessarily reflect a consensus. The view expressed below is that of the Leiden school, following [[Frederik Kortlandt]], whose views are somewhat controversial and not accepted by all scholars.

{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}

Note that all class A stems are long. This is because all such stems had Balto-Slavic acute register in the root, which can only occur on long syllables. (Short syllables, and long syllables with Balto-Slavic circumflex register, became class B nouns in Common Slavic.)

The distribution of short and long vowels in the stems without /j/ reflects the original vowel lengths, prior to the operation of Van Wijk's law, [[Dybo's law]] and [[Ivšić's law|Stang's law]], which led to class B nouns and the differing lengths in /j/ stems.

Class B ''jā''-stem nouns are not listed here. The combination of Van Wijk's law and Stang's law would have originally produced a complex mobile paradigm in these nouns, different from the mobile paradigm of ''ā''-stem and other nouns, but this was apparently simplified in Common Slavic times with a consistent neoacute accent on the stem, as if they were class A nouns. The class B ''jo''-stem nouns were also simplified, but less dramatically, with consistent ending stress in the singular but consistent root stress in the plural, as shown. Class B ''s''-stem noun are not listed here, because there may not have been any.

{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}

The accent pattern for the strong singular cases (nominative and accusative) and all plural cases is straightforward:
#All weak cases (genitive, dative, instrumental, locative) in the plural are ending-stressed.
#The *-à ending that marks the nominative singular of the (j)ā-stems and nominative–accusative plural of the neuter (j)o-stems is ending-stressed.
#All other strong cases (singular and plural) are stem-stressed.

For the weak singular cases, it can be observed:
#All such cases in the (j)o-stems are stem-stressed.
#All such cases in the j(ā)- and i-stems are end-stressed except the dative. (However, the masculine i-stem instrumental singular is stem-stressed because it is borrowed directly from the jo-stem.)

Note also that the long-rising versus short-rising accent on ending-accented forms with Middle Common Slavic long vowels reflects original circumflex versus acute register, respectively.

====Verbs====
{{Expand section|date=February 2013}}
The same three classes occurred in verbs as well.  Middle Common Slavic class B verbs in ''*-ī́tī'' had a neoacute retraction in Late Common Slavic in the present tense; that is, these verbs had original acute accent on the *-i- inflectional suffix in the infinitive, but neoacute accent on the stem in the present tense. This is due to the same process that caused neoacute retraction in class B ''jā''-stem nouns (see above).

==Reconstructed texts==
===Schleicher's PIE fable rendered into Proto-Slavic===
[[August Schleicher]] wrote a [[Schleicher's fable|fable]] in the PIE language he had just reconstructed, which though it has been updated a few times by others still bears his name. Below is a rendering of this fable into Proto-Slavic.

''Proto-Slavic''
:{{lang|sla|Ovьca i koňi: Ovьca kъja bez vьlny estь, koňę vidě, edinъ tęžьkъ vozъ tęglъ, i edinъ veliko bermę, i ešče edinъ čolvěka nosilъ bъrzo. Ovьca kǫňemъ reče: "Sьrdьce moje bolitь, viděti koňę že vozitь čolvekъ". Koňi rekošę: "Slušaji, ovьče! sьrdьca naša bolętь kogda vidimъ: mǫžъ, gospodь, ovьčьjejǫ vьlnojǫ sebě teplъ drabъ tvoritь. A ovьca bez vьlny estь." To slyšavъ, ovьca vъ dolъ poběže.}}

''English''
:{{lang|en|The sheep and the horses: A sheep that had no wool saw horses, one pulling a heavy wagon, one carrying a big load, and one carrying a man quickly. The sheep said to the horses: "My heart pains me, seeing horses carrying a man". The horses said: "Listen, sheep, our hearts pain us when we see this: a man, the master, makes the wool of the sheep into a warm garment for himself. And the sheep has no wool". Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.}}

===The king and the god rendered into Proto-Slavic===
''Proto-Slavic''
:{{lang|sla|Korľь estь, tь bezъ dětętъ. Korľь synu xotěaše. Tъ žьrьca sъprosi: "Synu mojego rodьna xoťǫ!" Žьrьca tomu korľu reče: "Modli sę bogu Perunu." Tъ korľь nyně kъ bogu Perunu dojьde aby bogu modliti sę. "Sluši mene, otьče Perune!" Bogъ Perun sъ nebese sъxodi. "Čьto xoťešь?" "Synu xoťǫ." "Tako bǫdi", reče jarъkъ bogъ Perunъ. Korľa sǫprǫga synu rodi.}}

''English''
:{{lang|en|Once there was a king. He was childless. The king wanted a son. He asked his priest: "May a son be born to me!" The priest said to the king: "Pray to the god Werunos." The king approached the god Werunos to pray now to the god. "Hear me, father Werunos!" The god Werunos came down from heaven. "What do you want?" "I want a son." "Let this be so," said the bright god Werunos. The king's lady bore a son.}}

A '''ring announcer''' is an in-ring (and sometimes on-camera) employee or contractor for a [[boxing]], [[professional wrestling]] or [[mixed martial arts]] event or promotion, who introduces the competitors to the audience.

In boxing and mixed martial arts bouts, introductions occur after both fighters have entered the ring or cage. Along with each fighter's name, the announcer typically also announces their height, weight, town, nickname, win/loss record and any current or past titles the fighter has won. In MMA, the fighting discipline is usually announced. In professional wrestling, wrestlers are similarly introduced, though usually before or as they come to the ring. In-ring introductions are sometimes used for title matches or other major bouts, to add a "big fight feel".

The ring announcer often states the rules of the match. In boxing and MMA, this is usually limited to the number of scheduled rounds and the length of each round. In professional wrestling, the [[Professional wrestling match types|variations are much more numerous]] and so the announcer may have to explain significantly more to the audience.

When an MMA or boxing bout concludes, the ring announcer announces the winner, time of finish and method. If the fight lasts all scheduled rounds, the announcer will read the fight judges' scorecard totals, before announcing a unanimous, majority, or split decision victory for one of the fighters, or a draw. This is typically done from inside the ring or cage.

In professional wrestling, the announcement is usually performed outside the ring, and typically doesn't mention the time or method of victory; however, as professional wrestling shows do incorporate an official timekeeper at ringside, much like boxing and MMA, some ring announcers may be informed of the time of the fall at the match's conclusion and will relay that information to the audience as well.

Even further to this, some professional wrestling matches will stipulate a time limit, the confines within which a wrestler must win if he wishes to avoid a time-limit draw. In cases like this, the ring announcer may inform the audience of how much time has passed (and will ordinarily do so every five minutes) and how much time remains.

In a championship match, the announcer specifies that the winner is either still the champion or the new champion.

[[File:selvage.jpg|thumb|right|A piece of curtain fabric showing its selvedge, i.e. the self-finished edge in the foreground.]]

A '''selvage''' (US English) or '''selvedge''' (British English) is a "self-finished" edge of [[fabric]], keeping it from unraveling and fraying.&lt;ref name="quilt idiot"&gt;{{cite book |title= The complete idiot's guide to quilting illustrated|last= Ehrlich|first= Laura|year= 2004|publisher= Alpha Books|isbn= 1-59257-201-4|page= 57|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=syAV3WZ08OIC&amp;dq|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="institute"/&gt; The term "self-finished" means that the edge does not require additional finishing work, such as hem or bias tape, to prevent fraying.

In woven fabric, selvages are the edges that run parallel to the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] (the longitudinal threads that run the entire length of the fabric), and are created by the [[weft]] thread looping back at the end of each row. In [[knit]]ted fabrics, [[selvage (knitting)|selvages]] are the unfinished yet structurally sound edges that were neither [[casting on|cast on]] nor [[binding off|bound off]].&lt;ref name="knit idiot"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Complete Idiot's Guide to Knitting and Crocheting Illustrated|last= Breiter|first= Barbara|author2=Gail Diven|year= 2003|publisher= Alpha Books|isbn= 1-59257-089-5|pages= 168–169|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4yr7vLUI5mkC&amp;dq|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCall's Sewing Book, Random House: 1968: 198, 224&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the term selvage applied only to [[loom]] [[weaving|woven]] fabric, though now can be applied to flat-[[knitted fabric]].

The terms ''selvage'' and ''selvedge'' are a corruption of "self-edge", and have been in use since the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Selvage." ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In textiles ==
===In woven cloth===
In textile terminology, threads that run the length of the fabric (longitudinally) are [[warp (weaving)|warp]] ends. Threads running laterally from edge to edge, that is from left side to right side of the fabric as it emerges from the [[loom]], are [[weft]] picks. Selvages form the extreme lateral edges of the fabric and are formed during the weaving process. The [[Weaving|weave]] used to construct the selvage may be the same or different from the weave of the body of the [[fabric]] cloth. Most selvages are narrow, but some may be as wide as {{convert|.75|in}}. Descriptions woven into the selvage using special [[jacquard weaving|jacquards]], colored or fancy threads may be incorporated for identification purposes. For many end-uses the selvage is discarded. Selvages are 'finished' and will not fray because the [[weft]] threads double back on themselves and are looped under and over the [[warp (weaving)|warp]].&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;A. Richard Horrocks, Subhash Anand, Textile Institute, ''Handbook of technical textiles'' ''Chapter 4.3 Selvedge Construction'', Woodhead Publishing: 2000, {{ISBN|1-85573-385-4}}, 559 pages: 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;

====Handwoven selvages vs. industrial selvages====
There is a slight difference between the selvages in handweaving and in industry, because while industrial looms originally very closely mimicked handweaving looms, modern industrial looms are very different. A loom with a shuttle, such as most hand weaving looms, will produce a very different selvage from a loom without a shuttle, like some of the modern industrial looms. Also in industry sometimes the selvage is made thicker with a binding thread.

Selvages of fabrics formed on weaving machines with shuttles, such as hand looms, are formed by the [[weft]] turning at the end of each pick (pass of the weft thread) or every second pick. To prevent fraying, various selvage motions (or "styles") are used to bind the warp into the body of the cloth. Selvages are created to protect the fabric during weaving and subsequent processing (i.e. burnishing, dyeing and washing) but ideally should not detract from the finished cloth via ripples, contractions or waviness.&lt;ref name="institute"/&gt;

In handweaving the selvage is generally the same thickness as the rest of the cloth, and the pattern may or may not continue all the way to the edge, thus the selvage may or may not be patterned. A [[plain weave]] selvage is the other option, where the last few threads on either side are woven in plain weave.

In industry the selvage may be thicker than the rest of the fabric, and is where the main [[weft]] threads are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silverbirches.com/weavingterms.shtml#P |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227051721/http://www.silverbirches.com/weavingterms.shtml#P |archive-date=2008|title=Weaving Terms and Expressions}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, they "finish" the left and right-hand edges of fabric as it exits the loom, especially for the ubiquitous "criss-cross" ''simple'' or ''tabby'' weave, referred to in industry as [[taffeta weave]].&lt;ref&gt;Kate Heinz Watson, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21534/21534.txt ''Textiles and Clothing''] American School of Home Economics, Chicago: 1907 &lt;/ref&gt; Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sew On|last= Meyrich|first=Elissa K. |author2=Dominic Harris|year= 2008|publisher= Macmillan|isbn= 0-312-37892-0|page= 22|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B5YZs0THBp4C&amp;dq|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used. A water- or air-jet loom creates a fringed selvage that is the same weight as the rest of the cloth, as by the weft thread is drawn via a jet nozzle, which sends the weft threads through the [[shed (weaving)|shed]] with a pulse of water. The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is [[beater (weaving)|beaten]] into place. Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Wool textile industry in Great Britain|last= Jenkins|first= John Geraint|year=1972 |publisher= Routledge|isbn= 0-7100-6979-0|page= 150|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=No09AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Usability of the selvage ====
In the decorative embellishment of garments, especially in decorative [[pleats|pleat]] or [[ruffle]]s, a selvage used as a ruffle is "self-finished", that is, it does not require additional finishing work such as [[Hemming (sewing)|hem]] or [[bias tape]] to prevent fraying.&lt;ref&gt;Colette Wolff, ''The art of manipulating fabric'', KP Craft: 1996 {{ISBN|0-8019-8496-3}}, 311 pages: pp299&lt;/ref&gt;

Very often fabric near the selvage is unused and discarded, as it may have a different weave pattern, or may lack [[Pile (textile)|pile]] or prints that are present on the rest of the fabric, requiring that the selvage fabric be cut off or hidden in a [[hem]]. Since industrial loomed fabric often has selvages that are thicker than the rest of the fabric, the selvage reacts differently. It may shrink or "pucker" during laundering and cause the rest of the object made with it to pucker also.

Thicker selvages are also more difficult to sew through. Quilters especially tend to cut off the selvage right after washing the fabric and right before cutting it out and sewing it together.&lt;ref name="quilt idiot" /&gt;

For garments, however, the selvage can be used as a structural component as there is no need to turn under that edge to prevent fraying if a selvage is used instead.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Rayon and Synthetic Fibres Manual'', Harlequin Press: 1954, 364 pages: pp232&lt;/ref&gt; Using the selvage eliminates unnecessary work, thus the garment article can be made faster, the finished garment is less bulky and can be stitched entirely by machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Sewing Essentials|author=Cy DeCosse Incorporated, Cowles Creative Publishing, Singer Company. Dept. of Sewing Education, Singer Company. Consumer Education Dept, Cy Decosse, Editors of creative Publishing, Singer Co|year= 1998|publisher= Creative Publishing international|isbn= 0-86573-308-2|page= 102|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnfbypa3BswC&amp;dq|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is of major benefit for the mass-produced ready-to-wear clothing of modern society. However, it is less used in homemade clothes because of the tendency of the selvage to pucker.

===In knitted cloth===
{{main|Selvage (knitting)}}

Applying the term ''selvage'' to a hand-knitted object is still relatively new. Most books on fabric define a selvage as the edge of a woven cloth. However, the term is coming into usage for hand-knitted objects. The edges of machine-knitted fabric on the other hand are rarely if ever referred to as selvages.

Selvages in knitting can either bear a special pattern worked into the first and last stitches or simply be the edge of the fabric. The two most common selvage stitches are the chain-edge selvage and the slipped-garter edge, both of which produce a nice edge. The chain-edge selvage is made by alternating rows of slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last stitch, with rows of slipping the first stitch purlwise&lt;!--repetition?--&gt; and purling the last stitch.&lt;ref name="knit idiot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knitting"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Everything Knitting Book|last= Eldershaw|first= Jane|year= 2002|publisher= Everything Books|isbn= 1-58062-727-7|pages= 60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-zMRhRDDMgC&amp;dq |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slipped garter edge is made by slipping the first stitch knitwise and knitting the last in every row.&lt;ref name="knit idiot"/&gt; Other selvages include a [[garter stitch]] border one stitch wide, or a combination of the above techniques.&lt;ref name="knitting"/&gt;

Knitting selvages makes the fabric easier to sew together than it would be otherwise. It also makes it easier to [[Pick up stitches (knitting)|pick up stitches]] later,&lt;ref name="knit idiot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knitting"/&gt; and is a good basis for [[crocheting]] a further decorative edge.&lt;ref name="knitting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;June Hemmons Hiatt (1988) ''The Principles of Knitting'', Simon and Schuster, pp. 163-168.  {{ISBN|0-671-55233-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In printing and philately==
[[File:£2 Roo Ash Imprint block.jpg|right|thumb|Part of a sheet of postage stamps from Australia showing selvage at the bottom.]]

In the [[printing|print]] industry, selvage is the excess area of a printed or perforated sheet of any material, such as the white border area of a sheet of stamps or the wide margins of an [[engraving]] etc.

'''Shahabuddin Nagari''' (born 6 October 1955) is a modern poet of [[Bangladesh]], who appeared in the 1970s and gained pre-eminence as a lyricist. According to literary critic [[Abdul Mannan Syed]], "Shahabuddin Nagari is one of those few powerful poets of 1970s whose mastery of mixing romanticism with instinct is amazing".&lt;ref&gt;Back cover of ''Midnight Locomotive and other poems''&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2016, he has published more than seventy five titles to his credit. Nagari is most noted for his songs and works for the children. He was a senior bureaucrat of the government of Bangladesh. In 1971, he actively participated in the liberation war of Bangladesh.

== Family ==
He married Dr. Aftabun Nahar Maksuda (1958) on 9 September 1983 at the age of 28. His wife's paternal residence is in Shalgaria, Pabna. At that time his wife was working as an Assistant Surgeon in the [[Chittagong Medical College and Hospital]]. His wife, having served as a government physician for a long time, was appointed as a Deputy Secretary to the Government of Bangladesh in 2006. At present she is the Additional  Secretary to the Government and working in the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock.

== Education ==
Nagari started his education in [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]]. After studying grade one and two in Dinajpur Bangla School, he got admitted into the Dinajpur Zilla School in grade three. At the middle of his grade five, his father was transferred to Barisal and he shifted with his mother and siblings to his village home. There, after finishing grade five in Shibnagar Primary School, he got admitted into Kansat High School in grade six. After getting promoted to grade eight, he moved with his family to Dhaka. At that time his father was working at the Dhaka DLR &amp; SS Office, Tejgaon, having been transferred from [[Barisal]]. After coming to Dhaka, he got admitted into the Rajabazar Nazneen High School. When he was a student of this school, he joined in a movement started in the country against the textbook ''Pakistan : Desh O Krishti'' (en: Pakistan : Country and Culture).  From this school he passed SSC in 1972. By that time, since his father was transferred to [[Chittagong]], he also shifted to Chittagong and got admitted into the higher secondary class in the [[Chittagong College]]. He passed HSC in 1974 from this college. Although he wanted to study English for Honours, he yielded to the desire of his family and got admitted into the Zoology Department of the Chittagong University in 1974. After completing his BSc (Honours) in 1978, he continued in the same department in the Thesis Group for Masters. The topic of his thesis was ''Rice Field Spiders in Chittagong''. He was the only entomologist who worked on spiders for the first time in Bangladesh (1978–80).&lt;ref&gt;''Rice field Spiders from Chittagong'', Proceedings of the Third National Zoological Conference, 1981, pp. 53–72, Published by The [[Zoological Society of Bangladesh]], Dhaka University, Dhaka, Bangladesh.&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his academic education in 1980. For some time he worked as a Research Fellow of the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission]] under the supervision of Professor (Dr.) Shafique Haider Chowdhury. Again his focus of research was spiders.

== Career ==
At the beginning of 1981, Nagari joined the Zoology Department of [[Chittagong University]] as a lecturer. However, inspired by his father, he appeared in the [[Bangladesh Civil Service]] (BCS) examination which he passed successfully and was appointed as Assistant collector of Customs &amp; Excise. He left the University job and joined the government service in the early December 1983. As a government officer he worked in various offices in different ranks and positions throughout the country under [[National Board of Revenue]] ( NBR ) of Ministry of Finance. He has retired  from Government Service since March 2016.

== Literary career ==
From the very childhood Shahabuddin Nagari has been involved in writing. When he was a student of his village school, he attempted to write some rhymes. His uncle late Abdul Mannan, then a student of [[Rajshahi University]], would come to the village every week (1966–67) and arrange literary gathering.  There, the youngest member Shahabuddin Nagari would read out his rhymes. After moving to Dhaka in 1968, he became a regular subscriber of 'Mukuler Mahfil' ([[The Daily Azad]]) and 'Kachi Kachar Ashor' ([[The Daily Ittefaq]]). About that time he started to send his compositions for publishing. On 30 July 1969, his first rhyme 'Ami Kobi' (I am a Poet) was published in the 'Mukuler Mahfil'. After fighting the liberation war in 1971, he went back to Chittagong and resumed literary activity. When a son of the famous politician late [[Jahur Ahmed Chowdhury]] published a weekly called 'Rajanigandha', he started to contribute there. Then he started writing in the children's section of 'The Daily Michhil'. Besides the newspapers of Chittagong, he started to write for children in almost all the national newspapers and magazines of Dhaka. His first book of rhymes ''Nil Paharer Chhara'' (1978) was published by the-then famous publishing house of Dhaka 'Muktodhara' (The Swadhin Bangla Sahittya Parishad). He published this book by directly contacting late [[Chittaranjan Saha]], the founder of Muktodhara Publications. His second book ''Mahakaler Batighar'' contained articles on literature and was published by Caucus Publishers, Chittagong in 1986. The same year his collection of rhymes ''Mouly Tomar Chhara'' was published by Dolna Prakashani of Chittagong.

=== Poetry ===
Nagari is essentially a romantic poet whose focal point of writing is a reflection of his sensitivity. Love constitutes a key component in his poetic thought. Also, a yearning for the past, for social issues and the occasional sadness that encircles human life are also highlighted in his work. The portrayal of Nagari's feelings comes through the exceptionally descriptive. Not only does it paint a vivid picture of his memories, it also allows one to virtually live the experiences Nagari acquired as an adolescent. He writes mostly in free verse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=156722 Passions that find a soul in poetry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Midnight Locomotive and Other Poems ====
''Midnight Locomotive and Other Poems'' is an anthology of eighty six poems by Shahabuddin Nagari, translated into English from original in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] by different hands. The culture of Bangladesh and a love for his country is a critical factor in Nagari's writing. This fact is unmistakably etched in the poem, "Our Dreams":

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
I touch the river, water fills up and it flows to the brim
brim full of water abounds in silvery ''hilsa''
If I look at a barren garden it is full with flowers, rose, marigold, ''hasnahena''
If I dream, Bangladesh also dreams a better future super powers bow down to our dreams.
monir
&lt;/poem&gt;

==== The Black Cat and Other Poems ====
''[[The Black Cat and Other Poems]]'' is a new book of poetry of Shahabuddin Nagari. It has been published by Authorhouse, USA in Sep. 2011. Nagari's passion for woman and nature combined together is amply demonstrated in a number of poems. His passionate love for his beloved is well depicted in the following lines :

&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
In the mid-night doorbell rang in your door
Soundless movement like soft steps of the cats
Smell of pheromone can be felt from inside the shoe
You didn't understand, put on the shoe, light flickered from it
Sound can be heard of feline steps on marble floor
I've made that pair of shoes with my skin
Under your feet lies my skin.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Other dimensions ==
Shahabuddin Nagari is a figure in the cultural sphere of Bangladesh. At once he is a vocalist, songwriter, composer, playwright and a script-writer. Considering his enthusiasm for music, his father got him admitted into the-then [[Pakistan Cultural Academy]] situated in Green Road, Dhaka. At that time he was a student of grade nine in the school. There Nagari learned both modern and classical music. He was taught modern song by M.A Hamid (now living in the USA), late [[Mahmudunnabi]] and [[Mohammad Abdul Jabbar]].  After the liberation in 1971, he learned music from Ustad Syed Anwar Mufti of [[Bangladesh Betar]], Chittagong. In 1977 he appeared for audition and became a listed singer in [[Bangladesh Television]]. A long hiatus from the world of music became inevitable due to studies and job. However, in 1994 he returned to music by singing for the BTV drama  ''Keu Fere Keu Fere Na''. In 1995, he developed acquaintance with two famous composers of the country, namely, [[Subal Das]] and [[Pranab Ghosh]]. In 1996, under the supervision of Subal Das his first audio album 'Bishonno Mon' was published and this gave birth to a new Shahabuddin Nagari. By 2004 he has had ten solo albums published. He has sung more than 200 songs. HMV (now RPG) of [[Kolkata]] has published his audio CD under the title ''Premer Gaan'' in 1999. In 2003 the song 'Bhalobasha Bhag Kora Jay Na' became widely popular throughout Bangladesh. In 2004 he wrote the story, dialogue, script and gave music direction for the feature film ''Ak Khando Jomi'' produced by [[Impress Telefilm Limited]]. The film was based on his poem 'Ak Khando Jomi' included in his book ''Aguner Ful Fote Thonte''.

== Publications ==
After his debut publication in 1978, a book of rhymes titled Nil Paharer Chhara, Nagari had never looked back. He wrote and published every year. Till date, he has published sixteen volumes of poetry including two in English translation. The count is seventeen for book of rhymes, six for juvenile novels and short stories and four for essays and articles. He has also written one novel and one travelogue. In addition he has compiled and edited with others three volumes of poems and rhymes. His introductory write-up on Bengali rhymes (1947–87) (adopted as the Introduction of Bangladesher Chhara, 1987) is the first research work on Bangladeshi rhymes and recognised as the first reference in our literature.

{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}
'''Surface finish,''' also known as '''surface texture''' or '''surface topography,''' is the nature of a [[interface (matter)|surface]] as defined by the three characteristics of lay, [[surface roughness]], and [[waviness]].&lt;ref name="degarmo223"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises the small, local deviations of a surface from the perfectly [[flatness (mathematics)|flat]] ideal (a true [[plane (geometry)|plane]]).

Surface texture is one of the important factors that control [[friction]] and transfer layer formation during sliding. Considerable efforts have been made to study the influence of surface texture on friction and wear during sliding conditions. Surface textures can be [[isotropy|isotropic]] or [[anisotropy|anisotropic]]. Sometimes, stick-slip friction phenomena can be observed during sliding, depending on surface texture.

Each [[manufacturing process]] (such as the many kinds of [[machining]]) produces a surface texture. The process is usually optimized to ensure that the resulting texture is usable. If necessary, an additional process will be added to modify the initial texture. The latter process may be [[grinding (abrasive cutting)]], [[polishing]], [[lapping]], [[abrasive blasting]], [[honing (metalworking)|honing]], [[electrical discharge machining]] (EDM), [[milling (machining)|milling]], [[lithography]], [[industrial etching]]/[[chemical milling]], laser texturing, or other processes.

==Lay==
[[File:Surface finish lay patterns.png|thumb|right|Examples of various lay patterns]]
Lay is the direction of the predominant surface pattern, ordinarily determined by the production method used. The term is also used to denote the winding direction of fibers and strands of a [[Rope#Laid or twisted rope|rope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=FM 5-125: Rigging Techniques, Procedures, and Applications |last=Herkommer |first=Mark |publisher=United States Department of the Army |year=1995 |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surface roughness==
{{Main|Surface roughness}}

Surface roughness, commonly shortened to ''roughness,'' is a measure of the total spaced surface irregularities.&lt;ref name="degarmo223"/&gt; In engineering, this is what is usually meant by "surface finish." A Lower number constitutes less of these irregularities on the surface.

==Waviness==
{{Main|Waviness}}

Waviness is the measure of surface irregularities with a spacing greater than that of surface roughness. These irregularities usually occur due to [[Wood warping|warping]], [[machining vibrations|vibrations]], or deflection during machining.&lt;ref name="degarmo223"/&gt;

== Measurement ==
[[File:Mechanical filtering of surface finish trace.svg|thumb|right|How a profilometer works]]
{{main|Surface metrology}}

Surface finish may be measured in two ways: ''contact'' and ''non-contact'' methods. Contact methods involve dragging a measurement [[stylus]] across the surface; these instruments are called [[profilometer]]s. Non-contact methods include: [[interferometry]], [[confocal microscopy]], [[focus variation]], [[structured light]], [[electrical capacitance]], [[electron microscopy]], [[atomic force microscopy]] and [[photogrammetry]].

==Specification{{anchor|Surface texture symbol}}==
In the United States, surface finish is usually specified using the ASME Y14.36M standard. The other common standard is [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) 1302.

[[File:Surface finish specification2.svg]]

== Manufacturing ==
Many factors contribute to the surface finish in manufacturing.  In forming processes, such as [[molding (process)|molding]] or [[metal forming]], surface finish of the [[die (manufacturing)|die]] determines the surface finish of the workpiece. In machining, the interaction of the cutting edges and the microstructure of the material being cut both contribute to the final surface finish.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In general, the cost of manufacturing a surface increases as the surface finish improves.&lt;ref name="degarmo227"&gt;{{harvnb|Degarmo|Black|Kohser|2003|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any given manufacturing process is usually optimized enough to ensure that the resulting texture is usable for the part's intended application. If necessary, an additional process will be added to modify the initial texture. The expense of this additional process must be justified by adding [[value (economics)|value]] in some way—principally better function or longer lifespan. Parts that have sliding contact with others may work better or last longer if the roughness is lower. Aesthetic improvement may add value if it improves the saleability of the product.

A practical example is as follows. An aircraft maker contracts with a [[vendor]] to make parts. A certain [[steel grades|grade of steel]] is specified for the part because it is [[ultimate tensile strength|strong]] enough and [[hardness|hard]] enough for the part's function. The steel is [[machinability|machinable]] although not [[Free machining steel|free-machining]]. The vendor decides to [[milling (machining)|mill]] the parts. The milling can achieve the specified roughness (for example, ≤ 3.2&amp;nbsp;µm) as long as the machinist uses premium-quality [[tipped tool|inserts]] in the [[end mill]] and replaces the inserts after every 20 parts (as opposed to cutting hundreds before changing the inserts). There is no need to add a second operation (such as grinding or polishing) after the milling as long as the milling is done well enough (correct inserts, frequent-enough insert changes, and clean [[cutting fluid|coolant]]). The inserts and coolant cost money, but the costs that grinding or polishing would incur (more time and additional materials) would cost even more than that. Obviating the second operation results in a lower [[unit cost]] and thus a lower [[price]]. The [[competition (economics)|competition]] between vendors elevates such details from minor to crucial importance. It was certainly possible to make the parts in a slightly less efficient way (two operations) for a slightly higher price; but only one vendor can get the contract, so the slight difference in efficiency is magnified by competition into the great difference between the prospering and shuttering of firms.

Just as different manufacturing processes produce parts at various tolerances, they are also capable of different roughnesses. Generally, these two characteristics are linked: manufacturing processes that are dimensionally precise create surfaces with low roughness. In other words, if a process can manufacture parts to a narrow dimensional tolerance, the parts will not be very rough.

Due to the abstractness of surface finish parameters, engineers usually use a tool that has a variety of surface roughnesses created using different manufacturing methods.&lt;ref name="degarmo227"/&gt;

The '''transfer window''' is the period during the year in which a [[football club]] can [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] players from other playing staff into their playing staff. Such a transfer is completed by registering the player into the new club through FIFA. "Transfer window" is the unofficial term commonly used by the media for the concept of "registration period" as described in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations%5fon%5fthe%5fstatus%5fand%5ftransfer%5fof%5fplayers%5fen%5f33410.pdf |format=PDF |title=Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players (2008) |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=23 January 2008 |date=19 October 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913151636/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the rules, each national football association decides on the time (such as the dates) of the 'window' but it may not exceed 12 weeks. The second registration period occurs during the season and may not exceed four weeks.

The transfer window of a given football association governs only international transfers into that football association. International transfers out of an association are always possible to those associations that have an open window. The transfer window of the association that the player is leaving does not have to be open.

The window was introduced in response to negotiations with the [[European Commission]]. The system has been used in many [[UEFA|European leagues]] before being brought into compulsory effect by [[FIFA]] during the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/1780263.stm|title=Uefa wants transfer windows|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=24 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; English football was initially behind the plans when they were proposed in the early 1990s, in the hope that it would improve teams' stability and prevent agents from searching for deals all year around, but by the time it was eventually introduced they had to be persuaded that it would work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=John |last1=Ashdown |first2=Rob |last2=Smyth |title=Why does the Premier League have a January transfer window |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/01/the-knowledge-premier-league-transfer-window |work=The Guardian  |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact regulations and possible exceptions are established by each competition's governing body rather than by the national football association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2005/01|archive-url=https://archive.is/20071029052205/http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/NewsFromTheFA/Postings/2005/01|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 October 2007|title=Transfer clarification|publisher=Football Association|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=1 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current schedules and exceptions ==

FIFA regulates in general that there shall be two windows, a longer one (max. twelve weeks) in the break between seasons and a shorter one (max. one month) in the middle of a season. The specific periods depend on the league's season cycle and are determined by the national football authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/regulations_on_the_status_and_transfer_of_players_en_33410.pdf|format=PDF|title=Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=29 October 2008|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major European leagues commence in the second half of the year (e.g. August or September) and stretch over two calendar years to the first half of the next year (e.g. May), resulting in a close season window in the Summer ending in August, and a mid-season window in January.

The periods are different when a league runs throughout a single calendar year, as in most [[Nordic countries]] due to weather constraints, [[Major League Soccer]] due to both weather and competition from other locally popular sports (notably [[basketball]] and [[American football]]), or as the traditional season in the Southern Hemisphere. The first window generally opens from 1 March until midnight of 30 April, followed by the in-season window from 1 to 31 August.

[[Premier League clubs]] in England voted to end the summer window on the Thursday before the start of the season - on August 9 in 2018, instead of August 31.  Because FIFA demands the window must be open for 12 weeks, the window will open around May 17, shortly after the final games of the season on May 13. Clubs will be able to sell players until August 31 but not buy replacements after the deadline of August 9.

Although, in England, transfers between clubs in the same league can take place as soon as the last competitive fixtures for the season have been played, many transfers will not be completed until 1 July because many players' contracts expire on 30 June. International transfers into the English leagues (including the Premier League) cannot be made until the window has opened on 17 May. Outside the transfer window, a club may still sign players on an emergency basis, usually if they have no goalkeeper available. Special dispensation from their competition's governing body, for example the Premier League, is required. The transfer window restriction does not apply to clubs in or below the [[National League (division)|National League division]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/mobile/football/13600908.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Transfers – June 2011 | date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the last day of a transfer window is on a weekend, the deadline can be extended to the following Monday at the request of those involved for business reasons.&lt;ref name="deadline_day_rules_and_regulations" /&gt; The first shift of the deadline since its inception took place in summer 2008, when the deadline was extended by 24 hours to fall on Monday 1 September at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7568921.stm |title=Transfer deadline to be extended |date=18 August 2008 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5bOAGADJu?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7568921.stm |archivedate=7 October 2008 |df=dmy }}  7 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/wenger-urges-fans-to-support-adebayor-as-striker-seals-new-deal-901913.html|author=Gatward, Matt|title=Wenger urges fans to support Adebayor as striker seals new deal|work= The Independent|date= 19 August 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer deadline in England was similarly extended to 5&amp;nbsp;pm 1 September 2009, due to the August Bank Holiday. The [[Deutsche Fußball Liga|German football league]] announced an extension of the January 2009 deadline to 2 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesliga.de/de/liga/news/2008/index.php?f=0000105068.php|title=Wechselperiode I endet erst am Montag|publisher=Bundesliga|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=29 August 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Free agent]]s can be signed by a club at any time during the season, if they had been released by their previous club before the end of the transfer window.&lt;ref name="deadline_day_rules_and_regulations"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/6971785.stm|title=Deadline day rules &amp; regulations|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 October 2008|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A club can request to sign a player on emergency basis, e.g. if several [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] are injured at the same time.&lt;ref name="deadline_day_rules_and_regulations" /&gt; Outside the transfer window in [[Football in England|England]], once seven days have passed following the end of a transfer window, clubs from the [[English Football League]] (Regulation 53.3.4)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/global/section6.aspx#TQpEOrzdeJySOqaP.99|title=Section 6 - Players|first=The Football|last=League|publisher=|accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (provided the player is not registered with a club from any league below the National League division) [[National League (division)|National League division]]&lt;ref&gt;http://footballconference.co.uk/uploads/docs/Rules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (Rule 6.6.4) can loan in players i) in the first half of the season, until 5.00pm on the fourth Thursday in November and ii) in the second half of the season, until 5.00pm on the fourth Thursday in March. An existing [[loan (football)|loan deal]] can be made permanent at any time outside the transfer window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.football-league.co.uk/global/section6.aspx |title= Section 6 - Players |publisher= The Football League |date=11 August 2014 |accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day upon which a window closes is known as '''transfer deadline day''', and is usually one of the busiest days of the window, generating a flurry of transfers, often because a number of interdependent transfers are completed resembling a [[Chain (in selling a house)|housing chain]], generating much media interest.

== Calls to end the transfer window ==

[[Steve Coppell]], former manager of [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in England's [[Premier League]], and others have called for the transfer window to be scrapped in favour of the previous system, where deals could be struck throughout the season until the closing weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2 January 2008| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/reading/article3120658.ece | title=Steve Coppell calls for end to transfer window | work=The Times | accessdate=2 January 2008 | location=London | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coppell said that the transfer window breeds panic and encourages "scurrilous" transfer activity adding that "I cannot see the logic in a transfer window. It brings on a fire-sale mentality, causes unrest via the media and means clubs buy too many players" adding that "The old system, where if you had a problem you could look at loans or make a short-term purchase, was far better than this system we have at the moment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2287651/Managers-hit-out-at-rubbish-transfer-system.html |title=Managers hit out at 'rubbish' transfer system |publisher=The Telegraph |date=1 January 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former England Manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] has also questioned the value of the transfer window, commenting: "You do wonder at times if it is right to have a window, it was easier when it was open all the time and perhaps fairer for the players. I am sure much of the business being done on the last day is a little bit desperate and that is not right. I think it was better before, but then I am old".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_7152349,00.html? |title=Sven wants windows scrapped |publisher=Sky Sports |date=5 September 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013 [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Arsène Wenger]] asked for the January transfer window to be limited to two transfers per window and claimed it is "unfair" in its current form. He cited [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] transfer activity as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21193630 |title=Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants two-player transfer limit |work=BBC |date=25 January 2013 |accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Wenger hit out at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s £37m purchase of [[Juan Mata]] from rivals [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. Wenger argued that the transfer was unfair because United and Chelsea had already played each other twice during the season, but United would still have to play Arsenal, and said that "the rules should be adapted more for fairness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/9129436/arsene-wenger-thinks-juan-matas-proposed-transfer-to-man-utd-from-chelsea-is-unfair |title=Arsene Wenger thinks Juan Mata's proposed transfer to Man Utd from Chelsea is unfair |publisher=Sky Sports |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Manuel Pellegrini]] backed the sentiment of Wenger, disagreeing that a player "can go from one team to another team in the same league at this part of the year" and also said that the winter transfer window was unbalanced in favour of big clubs, saying "a club with money can take the best players from the other teams".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manuel-pellegrini-agrees-with-arsene-wenger--juan-mata-moving-from-chelsea-to-manchester-united-is-unfair-9083543.html |title=Manuel Pellegrini agrees with Arsene Wenger - Juan Mata moving from Chelsea to Manchester United is unfair |publisher=The Independent |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/manchester-city/10596136/Manchester-City-manager-Manuel-Pellegrini-backs-Arsenal-conterpart-Arsene-Wenger-over-Juan-Mata-transfer.html |title=Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini backs Arsenal conterpart Arsène Wenger over Juan Mata transfer |publisher=The Telegraph |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] manager [[Alan Pardew]] questioned why the Premier League transfer window remains open after the start of the season after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] made a bid for midfielder [[Yohan Cabaye]] during his time as [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] manager in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23765521 |title=Alan Pardew unhappy at timing of Arsenal bid |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, [[FIFPro]] said that the current transfer window system is "failing football and its players", one of the main issues being that players are released from clubs without explanation or compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/31001193|title= Fifpro: players' union says 'failing' transfer system needs reform|date=27 January 2015|accessdate=27 January 2015 |publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In broadcasting, a '''trimulcast''' is a cluster of three radio stations and/or translators that play the same feed. Normally this is done in order to have full coverage of a certain area. Some stations use this technique to provide [[Rimshot (broadcasting)|rimshot]] coverage into a major [[Media market|market]] by broadcasting on the outskirts from three different locations, or combine multiple [[low power television]] stations in an attempt to provide the equivalent coverage of one full-power station.

== Examples==
*[[WGVX]]/WRXP/WWWM in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] making up a [[classic hip hop]] station called '''105 The Vibe'''.
*[[KRXV|KRXV, KHWY, and KHYZ]] cover the [[Mojave Desert]] from [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] to [[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]] and [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], with its target audience being listeners travelling into Nevada on [[Interstate 15 (California)|Interstate 15]] and [[Interstate 40 (California)|Interstate 40]] from [[Southern California]].

'''Triple parentheses''' or '''triple brackets''', also known as an '''(((echo)))''', are an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] symbol that has been used to highlight the names of individuals of a [[Jewish]] background,  or organizations who are thought to be owned by Jewish people. The practice originated from the [[alt-right]] blog ''[[The Right Stuff (blog)|The Right Stuff]]''; the blog's editors have explained that the symbol is meant to symbolize that the historic actions of Jews caused their [[Jewish surname|surnames]] to "echo throughout history".&lt;ref name=mic/&gt; The triple parentheses have been adopted as an online [[badge of shame|stigma]] by antisemites, [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], and [[White nationalism|white nationalist]]s to identify individuals of Jewish background as targets for [[online harassment]], such as Jewish political journalists critical of [[Donald Trump]] during his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 election campaign]].&lt;ref name="Waldman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waldman|first1=Katy|title=(((The Jewish Cowbell))): Unpacking a Gross New Meme From the Alt-Right|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2016/06/02/the_jewish_cowbell_the_meaning_of_those_double_parentheses_beloved_by_trump.html|accessdate=2 January 2017|publisher=Slate|date=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbs-tagjews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gunaratna|first1=Shanika|title=Neo-Nazis tag (((Jews))) on Twitter as hate speech, politics collide|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/neo-nazis-tag-jews-on-twitter-harassment-hate-speech-politics/|accessdate=2 January 2017|work=CBSNews.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the notation was brought to mainstream attention by an article posted by [[Mic (media company)|Mic]] in June 2016.&lt;ref name="mic-hatespeech"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Neo-Nazi (((Echoes))) Symbol Is Officially Hate Speech|url=https://mic.com/articles/145459/the-neo-nazi-echoes-symbol-is-officially-hate-speech|website=Mic|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jp-echos"/&gt; The reports also led [[Google]] to remove a [[browser extension]] meant to automatically place the "echo" notation around Jewish names on web pages,&lt;ref name="jp-echos"/&gt; and the notation being classified as a form of [[hate speech]] by the [[Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;ref name="mic-hatespeech"/&gt; In the wake of these actions, some users, both Jews and non-Jews, have intentionally placed their own names within triple parentheses as a sign of solidarity.&lt;ref name="cnn-echo"/&gt;

Prior to its use in this manner, ((( ''screen name'' ))) had been used in online communities such as [[AOL]] to indicate that a user was "cyberhugging" the user with the specified screen name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making the Internet Family Friendly|last=Lang|first=Brian|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=0-7852-7568-1|location=|pages=Section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
The use of the "echo" originated from a 2014 episode of ''The Daily [[The Holocaust|Shoah]],'' a [[podcast]] produced by the [[alt-right]], antisemitic, white nationalist blog ''[[The Right Stuff (blog)|The Right Stuff]].''&lt;ref name=ADLTRS&gt;[https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate From Alt Right to Alt Lite: Naming the Hate]. [[Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast includes a segment known as the "Merchant Minute", where Jewish names are spoken with a cartoonish echo effect to single them out.&lt;ref name=mic/&gt; The editors of ''The Right Stuff'' explained that the use of an echo, represented in text using triple parentheses, was an internal [[Internet meme|meme]] meant to symbolize an opinion that the actions of Jews in the past cause their names to "echo throughout history". From the inside out, each parenthesis represents perceived Jewish involvement in [[mass media]], [[mass immigration]], and global [[Zionism]].&lt;ref name=mic&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fleishman|first1=Cooper|last2=Smith|first2=Anthony|title=(((Echoes))), Exposed: The Secret Symbol Neo-Nazis Use to Target Jews Online|url=https://mic.com/articles/144228/echoes-exposed-the-secret-symbol-neo-nazis-use-to-target-jews-online#.sS1GX29cQ|accessdate=4 June 2016|publisher=Mic|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The triple parentheses have since been used on [[social networking service]]s such as [[Twitter]] by antisemites, alt-righters, [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]], and [[white nationalist]]s as a signal to target Jews for [[online harassment|harassment]].&lt;ref name=mic/&gt; A number of Jewish journalists told the website [[Mic (media company)|Mic]] that after their names were mentioned in echoes, they began to receive messages from [[Internet troll|trolls]] containing antisemitic messages, [[Holocaust]] photos, and death threats.&lt;ref name=mic/&gt; ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' reported that the triple parentheses had "emerged as a weapon in the arsenal of the so-called '[[alt-right]]', an amorphous, primarily online conservative movement that has been becoming more visible and vocal in the midst of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]]", and that these tactics were increasingly being used to target Jewish journalists posting content that was critical of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate.&lt;ref name="jp-echos"/&gt; A user who engages in these "dog-piling" actions described the echo notation as being like a "[[Dog-whistle politics|dog whistle]]".&lt;ref name="jp-echos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mic-hatespeech"/&gt; Search engines typically ignore [[punctuation]] contained in a query, meaning that it can be difficult to intentionally locate posts containing this notation.&lt;ref name=mic/&gt;

{{anchor|Coincidence Detector}}
In a June 2016 article detailing the phenomenon, Mic also reported that an [[browser extension|extension]] had been developed for the [[Google Chrome]] [[web browser]] known as "Coincidence Detector", which automatically places the triple parentheses around the names of individuals who "[have] been involved in certain political movements and media empires". The extension contains a list of 8,771 names, including common Jewish names and surnames, those of media personalities who have been critical of Trump, Trump's son-in-law [[Jared Kushner]], as well as organizations such as [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] and [[Kars4Kids]].&lt;ref name="verge-extensionpulled"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google pulls Chrome extension that marked Jewish people online|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/3/11853244/google-chrome-extension-jewish-people-pulled|website=The Verge|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There's a Google Chrome Extension Used to Track and Expose 'Anti-White' Jews|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/theres-a-google-chrome-extension-used-to-track-and-expose-anti-white-jews/|website=Mediaite|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GizCD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Menegus|first=Bryan|title=What Happened With That Anti-Semitic Chrome Extension?|date=3 June 2016|url=https://gizmodo.com/what-happened-with-that-anti-semitic-chrome-extension-1780420435|work=[[Gizmodo]]|access-date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fleishman|first1=Cooper|last2=Smith|first2=Anthony|title="Coincidence Detector": The Google Chrome Extension White Supremacists Use to Track Jews|date=2 June 2016|url=https://mic.com/articles/145105/coincidence-detector-the-google-extension-white-supremacists-use-to-track-jews|publisher=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]|access-date=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[surreal humour|absurdist]] Twitter user [[dril]] sparked controversy in June 2016 after posting a tweet in which he made satirical use of the triple parentheses.&lt;ref name="dril" /&gt; Specifically, dril tweeted "i refuse to consume any product that has been created by, or is claimed to have been created by, the ((([[Keebler Company|Keebler]] Elves)))".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=dril |number=747822549069926400 |date =June 28, 2016 |title=i refuse to consume any product that has been created by, or is claimed to have been created by, the (((Keebler Elves)))}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Jay Hathaway wrote that most of dril's followers understood the tweet to be an ironic joke exploring the uncertain "etiquette around this very 2016 expression of bigotry ...

==Response==
On June 3, 2016, following the publishing of the Mic article, [[Google]] pulled the Coincidence Detector extension from the [[Chrome Web Store]], citing a violation of its policies prohibiting “promotions of hate or incitement of violence”. It had been downloaded around 2,500 times before its removal.&lt;ref name="GizCD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jp-echos"&gt;{{cite news|title=Google removes anti-Semitic app used to target Jews online|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Google-removes-anti-Semitic-app-used-to-target-Jews-online-455902|accessdate=4 June 2016|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of Google’s removal of the extension, some Twitter users, including Jews and non-Jews, intentionally put triple parentheses around their usernames in an act of solidarity.&lt;ref name="cnn-echo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=King|first1=Hope|title=Google takes down Chrome extension targeting Jews|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/03/technology/google-racist-chrome-extension/|accessdate=4 June 2016|publisher=CNN|date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; White nationalists, in turn, put inverted echo parentheses - like ''')))this((('''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - around their usernames to indicate their non-Jewish heritage.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hess|first1=Amanda|title=For the Alt-Right, the Message Is in the Punctuation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/arts/for-the-alt-right-the-message-is-in-the-punctuation.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=15 June 2016|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] from ''The Atlantic'' said that he hoped that Jews could reclaim the symbolism in the same way as some LGBT people had reclaimed the word "[[queer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esensten|first1=Andrew|title=How Jews Are Re-claiming a Hateful neo-Nazi Symbol on Twitter|url=http://www.haaretz.com/world-news/u-s-election-2016/1.723576|accessdate=8 June 2016|work=Haaretz|date=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Weisman, an editor at ''[[The New York Times]]'', included the triple parentheses in the title of his 2018 book release, ''(((Semitism))): Being Jewish in America in the Age of Trump''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/24/playbook-birthday-jonathan-weisman-244096 |title=Birthday of the Day: Jonathan Weisman, NYT deputy Washington editor |first=Daniel |last=Lippmann |work=[[Politico]] |date=October 24, 2017 |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter’s policies forbid users from engaging in targeted abuse or harassment of other users; European head of public policy Karen White stated that “hateful conduct has no place on Twitter and we will continue to tackle this issue head on alongside our partners in industry and civil society”.&lt;ref name="mic" /&gt; On May 31, 2016, Twitter, along with [[Facebook]], Google, and [[Microsoft]], jointly agreed to a [[European Union]] code of conduct obligating them to review valid notifications of illegal [[hate speech]] posted on their services within 24 hours.&lt;ref name="guardian-euhatespeech"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft sign EU hate speech code|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/31/facebook-youtube-twitter-microsoft-eu-hate-speech-code|website=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2016, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) announced that it had placed the triple parentheses in its database of symbols that it considers hate speech. CEO [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] explained that the symbol was “the online equivalent of tagging a building with anti-Semitic [[graffiti]] or taunting someone verbally”, and that the ADL was “working with our partners in the tech industry to investigate this phenomenon more deeply”.&lt;ref name="ADL-hatespeech"&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL to Add (((Echo))) Symbol, Used by Anti-Semites on Twitter, to Online Hate Symbols Database|url=https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-to-add-echo-symbol-used-by-anti-semites-on-twitter-to-online-hate-symbols|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family and education ==

Tripo was born in 1755 as a member of the notable family Smeccia (''Smeća'', ''Smekija'' or ''Smekja'') from Perast, Bay of Kotor (''Boka Kotorska''). Today, the descendants of the Smeccia family live in [[Trieste]], now in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Vuković1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vuković|first=Novo|title=Književnost Crne Gore od XII do XIX vijeka: Analisti, hroničari, biografi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZPlAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Obod|page=48|quote=...угледне перашке по- родице Трипа Смекија (5тессша, по народном изго- вору Смећа), чији потомци сада живе у Трсту.

'''Umaru Pulavar''' ({{lang-ta|உமறுப் புலவர்}}) was a [[Tamil Muslim]] poet from [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. Umaru Pulavar was born in 1642 in the town of [[Ettayapuram]] in [[Thoothukudi district]]. He is celebrated as one of the greatest Islamic Poets of India.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoothukudi.tn.nic.in/umaru.html |title=Umaru Pulavar |publisher=Thoothukudi.tn.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and Family==
The forefathers of the poet came to Tamil Nadu to sell perfumes and settled in Nagalapuram, before moving to Ettayapuram where the poet was born. Umaru Pulavar’s literary talents flourished under Kadikai Muthu Pulavar that is only in Tamil language ({{lang-ta|கடிகை முத்து புலவர்}}), court poet of the [[Ettayapuram]] Zamin. At the age of 16, Umaru Pulavar stole the national limelight by winning a literary debate with Vallai Varundhi, a renowned poet from North India. Umaru Pulavar was then made the court poet of the Ettayapuram Zamin. But he was not able to learn Arabic grammar. While learning the Arabic language his master went for his essential work for earning money.His family and heirs were awarded with Pulavar title by government of Tamil Nadu, and they carry the initial before their bio initial. PF Nazeer, one of the last heir with some unpublished work poems died recently of cancer.His family has set up a trust for education and social reforms for poor people on his anniversary.

==Literary works==
He was commissioned by [[Seethakaathi]], the altruist son of entrepreneur [[Periya Thambi Nainar Marakkayar]], to pen ''Seerapuranam'' considered to be one of the best works in [[Tamil Muslim#literature|Tamil Muslim literature]] till date, depicting the biography of [[Muhammad|Nabi]]. It contains 5,027 poems in three ‘Kandams’ (parts), which are Vilathathu Kandam, Noobuvathu Kandam and Hijurathu Kandam. Each of the ‘Kandams’ narrates various stages of the life of Nabi.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

''Muthu Mozhil Malai'' and ''Sethakathi wedding poems'' are among his other literary works.

==Acknowledgements==
His memorial at Ettayapuram in Tuticorin district was renovated by the government of Tamil Nadu and was declared open by the then Speaker of legislative assembly and the then ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/30/stories/2007103059860600.htm |title=Tamil Nadu / Tuticorin News : Umaru Pulavar memorial inaugurated |publisher=The Hindu |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Umaru pulavar Tamil language center in [[Singapore]] named after the scholar strives for providing quality education in Tamil language in Singapore.

'''Vellara script''' or '''Vellara alphabet''' is one of the original [[Albanian alphabet]]s, encountered for the first time in early 19th century. It is named after the [[Greek people|Greek]] doctor, lyricist and writer [[Ioannis Vilaras]] (Jan Vellara in Albanian),&lt;ref name="SF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studime Filologjike|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vo9AQAAIAAJ|year=1964|publisher=[[Akademia e Shkencave e RPSSH]], Instituti i Gjuhesise dhe i Letersise|page=198|issue=1| quote = Në lidhje me këtë, E. Legrandi i shkruen revistës, se Dr. Vellara, asht njeri i njoftun dhe nuk asht shqiptar. Emni i tij i vërtetë asht Joannis Vellara...}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author of a manuscript where this alphabet is documented for the first and so far the only time. 

==Ioannis Vilaras==
Vilaras studied medicine in Padua in 1789 and later lived in Venice. In 1801, he became a physician to Veli, son of [[Ali Pasha Tepelena]] (1741–1822).&lt;ref name="Merry2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Merry|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Greek Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-lr20SuvfIC&amp;pg=PA457|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30813-0|pages=457–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vilaras is remembered primarily as a modern Greek poet, non-native Albanian speaker but fluent, according to [[François Pouqueville]], who also describes him as bright. Vilaras spent time in southern [[Albania]].&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1976"/&gt;

==The manuscript==
The manuscript of the work was donated to the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] in [[Paris]] (supplément grec 251, f. 138-187) in 1819 by François Pouqueville (1770–1839), French consul in [[Janina]] during the reign of Ali Pasha. Pouqueville was aware of the value of the work, noting: "Je possède un manuscrit, une grammaire grecque vulgaire et schype qui pourrait être utile aux philologues", but chose not to publish it in his travel narratives. Pages 137-226 contain the material in Albanian.&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1976"&gt;{{citation| author=Dhimiter Shuteriqi| page=151-152|location = Tirana| year=1976| oclc=252881121 | publisher= Academy of Sciences of PR of Albania| title=Shkrimet Shqipe ne Vitet 1332-1850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pages 137-138 contain a list of [[proverb]]s in modern Greek and Albanian. Pages 138-187, in two columns per page format, contain  the collection of grammatical notes both in Greek and Albanian. These bilingual grammatical notes, dated 1801, were designed no doubt to teach other Greek-speakers Albanian. On page 187, there is a list of names of [[living thing]]s. Page 191 starts the Greek-Albanian [[phraseology|phraseologies]]. On page 217, there is a mini-dictionary with trees names, human body parts, and vegetable names. The alphabet shows in page 219.
Appendixed to the grammatical notes is also a letter dated 30 October 1801, written in Albanian in Vellara's handwriting from the village of Vokopolë, south of [[Berat]], where the physician had been obliged to follow Veli during the latter's military campaign against [[Ibrahim of Berat]].

==The alphabet==
The alphabet comprises 30 letters. It leans towards the [[Latin script]], and less the [[Greek script|Greek one]], with some special characters for Albanian's particular sounds. Albanian alphabet's "[[Voiceless alveolar affricate|c]]" and "[[Voiced alveolar affricate|x]]" are covered by a single letter ("x" is never found in Vellara's writings). Today's "[[Ë|ë]]" is represented by "e", and "[[E|e]]" by "[[É|é]]". There are no letters for today's [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] "[[Ll|ll]]", "[[Rr (digraph)|rr]]", "[[Zh (digraph)|zh]]", and "[[Close front rounded vowel|y]]". Instead, "y" is substituted with "[[Close back rounded vowel|u]]" or "[[Close front unrounded vowel|i]]". Today's "[[Palatal nasal|nj]]" is represented by a [[Cyrillic script|cyrillic]] letter.&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1976"/&gt;

==History==
The first scholar to study the script was the French [[geographer]] [[Conrad Malte-Brun]] in his ''Universal Geograpraphy'' (1827). He thought that the script is without doubt a [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] one (and not Vellara's original), which resembles ancient alphabets, and emerged during important milestones that [[Christianity]] passed in the area.&lt;ref name="Malte-BrunHuot1834"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Conrad Malte-Brun|author2=Jean-Jacques-Nicolas Huot|title=A system of universal geography: or A description of all the parts of the world, on a new plan, according to the great natural divisions of the globe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKYgAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA421|year=1834|publisher=S. Walker|pages=421–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"But there is, if we may so term it, an ecclesiastical alphabet, which consists of thirty lettes; and many of them are not unlike the [[Phoenician script|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]], [[Armenian script|Armenian]] or [[Palmyrene alphabet|Palmyrenian]] characters; few of them have resemblance with the [[Bulgarian alphabet |Bulgarian]] or [[Thracian Goths|Moesogothic]], and we look in vain for the [[Pelasgians#Language|Pelasgic]], [[Old Italic script#Etruscan alphabet|Etruscian]] or [[Runes|Runic]] letters. This alphabet in its present form, was probably constructed by Christian priests, either in the second century when Christianity was introduced into the country, or in the ninth, when the Albanian church was united with [[Roman Catholicism|that of Rome]]; but is evidently derived from other alphabets, much more ancient, which at one period were used in [[Illyria]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Epirus]]."}}
Vilara's letter signed by him as ''"30 Oktomvrit 1801 Vagopolja, mik tëndë Jatroi Vellara"'' (October 30th 1801, Vokopolja, your friend Doctor Vellara), shows that the alphabet was known and used by other people at that time.
&lt;br&gt;During the [[Albanian National Renaissance]], the script was made known to the Albanian circles, first published in 1898 by the ''[[Albania (periodical)|Albania]]'' magazine in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SF"/&gt;

'''Yiddish dialects''' are variants of the [[Yiddish]] language and are divided according to the region in Europe where each developed its distinctiveness. Linguistically, Yiddish should be divided in distinct Eastern and Western dialects. From Eastern Yiddish, Northeastern dialects were dominant in 20th-century Yiddish culture and academia, while Southern dialects of Yiddish are now the most commonly spoken, preserved by many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] communities.

==Varieties==
[[File:Yidish-dialects-ru.png|thumb|330px|Yiddish dialects (late 19th-early 20th century):&lt;br /&gt;
{{Legend inline|#DBDB70|Western dialects}}
{{Legend inline|#FBEC5D|Eastern dialects}}]]
Yiddish dialects are generally grouped into either Western Yiddish and Eastern Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=yih Western Yiddish]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ydd Eastern Yiddish].&lt;/ref&gt; Western Yiddish developed from the 10th century in Western Europe, in the region which was called Ashkenaz by Jews, while Eastern Yiddish developed its distinctive features in Eastern Europe after the movement of large numbers of Jews from western to central and eastern Europe. 

General references to the "Yiddish language" without qualification are normally taken to apply to Eastern Yiddish, unless the subject under consideration is Yiddish literature prior to the 19th century, in which case the focus is more likely to be on Western Yiddish.

===Western Yiddish===
Western Yiddish included three dialects: Northwestern (spoken in Northern Germany and the Netherlands), Midwestern (spoken in central Germany), and Southwestern (spoken in southern Germany, France, and neighboring regions extending into Northern Italy). These have a number of clearly distinguished regional varieties, such as [[History of Jews in Alsace#Language and origins|Judeo-Alsatian]], plus many local subvarieties. 

The language traditionally spoken by the Jews of Alsace is ''Yédisch-Daïtsch'' or Judeo-Alsatian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/dialecte/ Yédisch-Daïtsch, le dialecte judéo-alsacien] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally a mixture of [[German language|German]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] idioms and virtually indistinguishable from mainstream Yiddish. From the 12th century onwards, due among other things to the influence of the nearby [[Rashi]] school, [[French language|French]] linguistic elements aggregated as well, and from the 18th century onwards, some [[Polish language|Polish]] elements due to immigrants blended into Yédisch-Daïtsch too.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaisme.sdv.fr/dialecte/articles/plevy.htm Structure du parler judéo-alsacien] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to C. J. Hutterer (1969), "In western and central Europe the WY dialects must have died out within a short time during the period of reforms [i.e. the movements toward [[Jewish emancipation]]] following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Jochnowitz, George (2010). "[http://www.jochnowitz.net/Essays/WesternYiddish.html Western Yiddish in Orange County, New York State]". jochnowitz.net. Retrieved 14&amp;nbsp;September 2017. Jochnowitz is a professor emeritus of linguistics at the [[College of Staten Island]], City University of New York. "This article appeared in ''Les Cahiers du CREDYO''. No. 5 (2010), published by the Centre de Recherche, d'Etudes et de Documentation du Yidich Occidental."&lt;/ref&gt; Western Yiddish is no longer spoken natively.&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Language/Yiddish#id0ek1ae Yiddish Dialects]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Yiddish===
Eastern Yiddish is split into Northern and Southern dialects.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; Northeastern Yiddish, also known as ''Litvish'' or ''Lithuanian Yiddish'', was spoken in modern-day [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], [[Latvia]], and portions of northeastern [[Poland]], northern and eastern [[Ukraine]], and western [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; The Southern dialects are again subdivided: ''Mideastern'' or ''Polish Yiddish'' was spoken in Poland, western [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and much of [[Hungary]], while ''Southeastern'' or ''Ukrainian Yiddish'' was spoken in [[Volhynia]], Podolia, and [[Bessarabia]] ([[Romania]]).&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Some authors use the term "Southeastern Yiddish" as a collective designation for both ''Poylish'' and ''Ukrainish'' while still applying the term Northeastern Yiddish to ''Litvish''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ukrainian Yiddish was the basis for standard theater Yiddish, while Lithuanian Yiddish was the basis of standard literary and academic Yiddish.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The latter differs slightly from Lithuanian Yiddish in that many words with /oj/ in the standard have /ej/ in Lithuanian Yiddish, e.g. וואוין = Standard /vojn/, Lithuanian /vejn/. See {{cite book|title=Grammar of the Yiddish Language|last=Katz|first=Dovid|year=1087|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|isbn=0-7156-2161-0|page=38|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

About three-quarters of contemporary Yiddish speakers speak Southern Yiddish varieties, the majority speaking Polish Yiddish.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; Most Hasidic communities use southern dialects, with the exception of [[Chabad]] which uses ''Litvish''; many Haredim in Jerusalem also preserve Litvish Yiddish.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; 

===Udmurtish Dialect===
[[History of the Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan|Jews in Udmurtia and Tatarstan]] (the Yiddish appellation is ''"dos udmurtishe yidntum"'') formed the local dialect until the 1930s and features of Yiddish of migrants "joined" into it (in the 1930s and 1940s);&lt;ref name="snioo.ru"&gt;Altyntsev A.V., "The Concept of Love in Ashkenazim of Udmurtia and Tatarstan", Nauka Udmurtii. 2013. no. 4 (66), p. 131.

С. 131: Комментарии.) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result up to the 1970s and 1980s the Udmurt dialect (''Udmurtish'') was divided into two linguistic subgroups: the central subgroup (with centers [[Izhevsk]], [[Sarapul]] and [[Votkinsk]]) and the southern subgroup (with centers [[Kambarka]], [[Alnashi]] (see [[Alnashsky District#Jewish community|the rural Jewish community of Alnashsky District]]), [[Agryz]] and [[Naberezhnye Chelny]]).&lt;ref name="snioo.ru"/&gt; 

One of the characteristic features of the Udmurt dialect is a noticeable number of [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]] and [[Tatar language|Tatar]] loan words.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg-Altyntsev A.V., [http://files.literjewsudmurtia.webnode.ru/200000026-c8fefc9fbc/A.%20Goldberg-Altyntsev%20-%20A%20short%20ethnographic%20overview%20of%20the%20Ashkenazic%20Jews%20group%20in%20Alnashsky%20District%20of%20Udmurt%20Republic.pdf "A short ethnographic overview of the Ashkenazic Jews' group in Alnashsky District of Udmurt Republic".] Die Sammlung der wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten der jungen jüdischen Wissenschaftler.

С. 132: Комментарии.) {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences Between Dialects===
The primary differences between the contemporary dialects are in the quality of stressed vowels, though there are also differences in morphology, lexicon, and grammar.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Grammar of the Yiddish Language|last=Katz|first=Dovid|year=1087|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|isbn=0-7156-2161-0|page=38|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Northern dialects are more conservative in vowel quality, while southern dialects have preserved vowel quantity distinctions.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt;

==Comparison==
Stressed vowels in the Yiddish dialects may be understood by considering their common origins in the Proto-Yiddish sound system. Yiddish linguistic scholarship uses a system developed by M. Weinreich (1960) to indicate the descendent [[diaphoneme]]s of the Proto-Yiddish stressed vowels.&lt;ref name="j28"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jacobs|2005|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each Proto-Yiddish vowel is given a unique two-digit identifier, and its reflexes use it as a subscript, for example Southeastern ''o&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the vowel /o/, descended from Proto-Yiddish */a/.&lt;ref name="j28" /&gt; The first digit indicates Proto-Yiddish '''quality''' (1-=*[a], 2-=*[e], 3-=*[i], 4-=*[o], 5-=*[u]), and the second refers to '''quantity or diphthongization''' (-1=short, -2=long, -3=short but lengthened early in the history of Yiddish, -4=diphthong, -5=special length occurring only in Proto-Yiddish vowel 25).&lt;ref name="j28" /&gt; 

Vowels 23, 33, 43 and 53 have the same reflexes as 22, 32, 42 and 52 in all Yiddish dialects, but they developed distinct values in [[Middle High German]]; Katz (1978) argues that they should be collapsed with the -2 series, leaving only 13 in the -3 series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Katz|1978|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some dialects have final consonant devoicing.

Merger of {{IPAslink|ʃ}} into {{IPAslink|s}} was common in Litvish Yiddish in previous generations.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; Known as ''Sabosdiker losn'', it has been stigmatized and deliberately avoided by recent generations of Litvaks.

==Development of "neutral" form==
As with many other languages with strong literary traditions, there was a more or less constant tendency toward the development of a neutral written form acceptable to the speakers of all dialects. In the early 20th century, for both cultural and political reasons, particular energy was focused on developing a modern Standard Yiddish. This contained elements from all three Eastern dialects but its phonetic attributes were predominantly based on Northeastern pronunciation. A separate article describes the resulting modern [[Yiddish phonology|Standard Yiddish phonology]], without detailing the phonetic variation among the three contributing dialects or the further distinctions among the myriad local varieties that they subsume.

A useful early review of the differences between the three main Eastern dialects is provided by the Yiddish lexicographer Alexander Harkavy in a ''Treatise on Yiddish Reading, Orthography, and Dialectal Variations'' first published in 1898 together with his Yiddish-English Dictionary ([[#harkavy1898|Harkavy 1898]]). A scanned facsimile is [http://www.cs.engr.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/harkavy/index.utf8.html available online]. The relevant material is presented there under the heading [http://www.cs.engr.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/harkavy/0015.png Dialects].

==Standardization controversy==
[[Image:Center for Jewish History NYC 14.JPG|thumb|YIVO on 16th Street in Manhattan, New York City]]Harkavy, like others of the early standardizers, regards Litvish as the "leading branch". That assertion has, however, been questioned by many authors and remains the subject of keen controversy. [[YIVO]], the Jewish Scientific Institute,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yivo.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is often seen as the initiating agent in giving phonetic preference to Litvish, but Harkavy's work predates YIVO's and he was not exclusively describing personal preference. A broad-based study provided in the ''Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry'' (discussed in detail below under the heading [[#Documentation|Documentation]]) provides a clearer picture of the more recent YIVO perspective.

The heart of the debate is the priority given to the dialect with the smallest number of speakers. One of the alternative proposals put forward in the early discussion of standardizing spoken Yiddish was to base it on the pronunciation of the Southeastern dialect, which was the most widely used form in the [[Yiddish theatre]] (c.f. ''[[Bühnendeutsch]]'', the stage pronunciation, as a common designation for [[Standard German]].)

There is nothing unusual about heated debate over [[language planning]] and reform. Such normative initiatives are, however, frequently based on legislative authority&amp;nbsp;– something which, with the exception of regulation in the [[Soviet Union]], has never applied to Yiddish. It might therefore be expected that the controversy about the development of Standard Yiddish would be particularly intense.

The acrimony surrounding the extensive role played by YIVO is vividly illustrated by in remarks made by Birnbaum:{{Quote|There is no standard pronunciation in Yiddish. However, the members and friends of the Yivo Institute for Jewish Research, New York, have strong views on the subject. They are convinced that Y should not differ in this respect from the great Western languages, and so they are willing to introduce a standard one. In their publications they speak as if it were already in existence, but this is wishful thinking&amp;nbsp;– acceptance of their system being restricted to their circle. The original proponents of this 'standard' were speakers of the Northern dialect and so, without further ado and without discussing the matter or giving any reasons, they decided that their own pronunciation was the 'standard'. However, the man in the street knows nothing about it. If he happens to be a Southerner he does not exchange his rich phonemic system for the meagre one of the Northern dialect. He does not even know that this is 'supposed to be' the 'standard'. And if he is a Northerner, he goes on speaking as before, without realizing that he would need to change only one of his vowels in order to qualify as a speaker of the 'standard'. It is ironic that the partisans of the 'standard'&amp;nbsp;– all convinced democrats&amp;nbsp;– should ask the majority of Yiddish-speakers to switch over from their own pronunciation to that of a minority, comprising only a quarter of all Yiddish speakers.|[[#birnbaum1979|Solomon Birnbaum, 1979]]}}

Recent criticism of modern Standard Yiddish is expressed by Michael Wex in several passages in [[#wex2005|Wex 2005]]. Regardless of any nuance that can be applied to the consideration of these arguments, it may be noted that modern Standard Yiddish is used by very few mother-tongue speakers and is not evoked by the vast bulk of Yiddish literature. It has, however, become a norm in present-day instruction of Yiddish as a foreign language and is therefore firmly established in any discourse about the development of that language.

==Documentation==
Between 1992 and 2000, YIVO published a three-volume ''Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry'', commonly referred to as the ''LCAAJ''. This provides a detailed description of the phonetic elements of what is presented as an Eastern-Western [[dialect continuum]], and mapping their geographic distribution.  A more recent extensive phonetic description, also of both Eastern and Western Yiddish, is given by Neil G. Jacobs in [[#jacobs2005|Jacobs 2005]].

== Life ==
Zareh Vorpouni was born Zareh Euksuzian in [[Ordu]], a city in Turkey on the southeastern shore of the [[Black Sea]]. He received his early education at the local Movsesian school. His father was killed during the 1915 [[Armenian genocide]], but his mother managed to flee to [[Sevastopol]], [[Crimea]], with her four children, Zareh, Nourhan, Melanoush and Garabed. After a year the family moved to [[Constantinople]], where Zareh attended (1919–22) the Berberian school, and in 1922 they moved to France.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; They lived in Marseille for two years, then in Paris (1924–30) and [[Strasbourg]] (1930-37). From his early days in France Zareh was an avid reader, acquainting himself with European intellectual trends and prominent works of French literature, particularly those of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;

== Literary Activity ==
Vorpuni belonged to the group of promising young Armenian intellectuals-among them [[Nigoghos Sarafian]], Vazken Shushanian, [[Shahan Shahnur]], and Hrach Zartarian: mostly orphans of the [[Armenian genocide]]-who emigrated to France in the early 1920s and produced literature that derived its themes from the social, cultural, moral, and psychological distresses of the [[emigres]] and their deep concerns about the eventual loss of their ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; In Paris he and Bedros Zaroyan jointly edited two short-lived periodicals, ''Nor Havadk'' (New Faith, 1924) and ''Lusapats'' (Daybreak, 1938–39).&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920 : with an introductory history" /&gt; In 1939, at the beginning of [[World War II]], he was called up for service in the French army. He was captured and held prisoner of war in Germany until the end of the war in 1945. Recollections of his prison days appear in a cycle of ten short stories called ''I Khorots Srdi'' (From the bottom of my heart).&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920 : with an introductory history" /&gt;

His first novel, ''Portse'' (The Attempt, 1929) depicts the hard life of an Armenian immigrant family of four plucked out of their native land and transplanted to [[Marseilles]], where they suffer the impact of a totally strange environment.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; ''Portse'' is the first volume of a quartet, intended by the author to be published under the collective title ''Haladzvadznere'' (The Persecuted). However, the succeeding three volumes - ''Tegnadzun'' (The candidate, 1967), ''Asfalte'' (Asphalt, 1972), and ''Sovoragan or me'' (An ordinary day, 1974) were not published until much later. In ''Tegnadzun'' the main character, Vahakn, embodies the tormented young generation that bore the psychological trauma of the [[Armenian genocide]] and remained its victims, leaving a moral legacy to the entire nation.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; In the other two volumes the author delves more deeply into the psychology of his characters, probing the sources of their anguish. However, almost all his characters, no matter how battered, are firmly determined to survive.&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt;

Of primary significance among Vorpuni's writing are his three volumes of short stories, ''Vartsu Senyag'' (Room for rent, 1946), ''Antsrevod orer'' (Rainy days, 1958), and ''Badmvadzkner'' (Stories, 1966).&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; In these tales he bares the hidden emotions and mental anguish of his characters and deplores the disintegration of the Armenian identity as it gradually becomes a burden for the new generation. The subtle presence of the [[Armenian genocide]] is felt through these narratives.&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920 : with an introductory history" /&gt;

In 1946 Vorpuni visited [[Soviet Armenia]] and recorded his impressions in ''Tebi Yergir'', ''Husher Hayreniki n Hayreniken'' (Memories from the homeland, 1947). Another important work is the novel ''Yev yeghev mart'' (And there was man, 1965).&lt;ref name="The Heritage of Armenian Literature From The Eighteenth Century To Modern Times." /&gt; The title was later reused for a collection of his works published in [[Yerevan]] in 1967 that includes ''Portse,'' ''Yev yeghev mard'', and other short stories.&lt;ref name="A reference guide to modern Armenian literature, 1500-1920 : with an introductory history" /&gt;

== Translation ==
Zareh Vorpouni's first work to appear in English translation is Zareh Vorpouni, ''The Candidate: A Novel'', trans. Jennifer Manoukian and Ishkhan Jinbashian (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2016). In the translator's introduction, Manoukian writes, "From this footnote has emerged a translation that resists, much like in the spirit of the original. It resists the isolation and insularity of literature written in a minority language; it resists the idea that culture in diaspora is fossilized, stagnant, or in decline; and it resists the notion that Armenians have only their century-old plight to offer the world outside their national cocoon."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Candidate|last=Vorpouni|first=Zareh|publisher=Syracuse University Press|year=2016|isbn=0815634684|location=Syracuse, NY|pages=xii-xiii|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
