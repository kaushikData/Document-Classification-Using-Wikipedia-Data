'''Alan Clay''' (born 1954, [[Whanganui]], New Zealand) is a film director, writer and clown teacher. In his early career he performed and taught extensively as a clown. He wrote three novels and a clown textbook. He went on to write and direct a short film and two feature films, which are adapted from his novels.

==Biography==
Clay is the son of literacy scientist, [[Marie Clay]].

In 2007 he produced, wrote and directed the short film '''''Moontan''''', a story about two street clowns swept up in the occupation of New Zealand's last Victorian theatre, the [[Royal Wanganui Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmedia.net.nz/moontan.htm |title=Moontan, a Digital Short Feature Film |publisher=Artmedia.net.nz |date=15 December 2010 |accessdate=31 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222102416/http://www.artmedia.net.nz/moontan.htm |archivedate=22 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was an adaptation of his first novel, published in 1995.

''Moontan'' screened at the [[Couch Soup|Fringe Film Festival]] in [[Wellington, New Zealand]] in July 2007, and in the Market at the [[Clermont-Ferrand#Culture|Clermont-Ferrand Short Film Festival]] 2008 and the Short Film Corner at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France. A DVD was released in 2009, which includes a 20-minute 'making of' documentary.

Clay produced, wrote and directed his first feature film '''''[[Butterfly Crush]]''''' in 2009, which he adapted from his novel ''Dance Sisters''. The film was released in New Zealand in 2010 and will be distributed in North America by Vanguard Cinema.

''Butterfly Crush'' won an "Accolade Award of Excellence" for Best Supporting Actor for Amelia Shankley's portrayal of the Dreamguides leader, Star. The film won the "Best International Narrative Feature" award at the Anthem Film Festival in Las Vegas, which presents "the year's best films about personal and civil liberty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthemfilmfestival.com/Awards.aspx/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707030320/http://anthemfilmfestival.com/Awards.aspx/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=2011 ANTHEM AWARDS |publisher=anthemfilmfestival |accessdate=4 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also won the "Best Feature Drama" at the Indie Gathering Film Festival in Ohio and the "Best Feature Film" award at the Reel Independent Film Extravaganza in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theindiegathering.com/page23.php/ |title=16th Indie Gathering International Film Festival &amp; more! – 2011 Winners |publisher=Theindiegathering.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reelindependentfilm.com/home.cfm/ |title=Reel Independent Film Extravaganza – Home |publisher=Reelindependentfilm.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''[[Courting Chaos]]''''' is a 2014 award winning romantic comedy, which Clay wrote and directed. The film is adapted from his book ''Angels Can Fly, a Modern Clown User Guide'' and the story is about a Beverly Hills girl who falls for a Venice Beach street clown called Chaos. She must overcome her inhibitions and become a clown herself for the relationship to survive.

''Courting Chaos'' won the Best Comedy Film award at its premiere at the [[Hollywood Reel Independent Film Festival]] in February 2014 and went on to win the Special Jury Award for Romantic Comedy from [[WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival]], one of the top awards from the oldest independent film festival in the world, where lead actor, Rachelle DiMaria, was also nominated for Best Actor. The film also received Awards of Merit for Best Director and Best Feature Film from the [[Accolade Competition]].

==Writing career==
His first novel, ''Moontan, a Clown's Story'', was well received at its launch at the Wellington Fringe Festival in New Zealand, and in Australia at the [[Brisbane Festival|Warana Festival]] in Brisbane in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmedia.com.au/reviews1.htm |title=Alan Clay (1994) Moontan, a Clown Story, Artmedia ISBN 978-0-9871357-3-5 |publisher=Artmedia.com.au |date=1 January 2007 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay's second novel ''Dance Sisters'' was launched at the [[Melbourne Writers Festival]] in 1997. In the novel a female song and dance trio threatens to self-destruct on the brink of fame, when its leader becomes involved with a manipulative cult, touting astrology and virtual dreaming.

In Clay's third novel, ''Believers in Love'', a father and daughter team of sand-sculptors embark on an adventure which takes them from Sydney's [[Bondi Beach]] to a magic mountain in New Zealand, in which they explore the transient nature of art and life, and discover that dreams are real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmedia.com.au/americanreviews.htm |title=US Reviews |publisher=Artmedia.com.au |date=20 June 2004 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; American reviews of ''Believers in Love'' were positive and as a result Clay toured literary festivals in the United States and Canada in 2003.

In 2005 he published ''Angels Can Fly, a Modern Clown User Guide'', which includes 50 clown exercises developed over 30 years of teaching and to which clowns from around the world have submitted anecdotes from their experience. ''Angels Can Fly'' was launched at the Brisbane Festival.

He settled in Adelaide in 1989, where he taught youth theatre and TAFE classes over three years and served on the board of the [[Adelaide Fringe Festival]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

From 1992 to 1999 he taught comedy and acting at the Actors Centre Australia and from 2003 to 2006 he taught Clown Masterclasses in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States including teaching and performing at the [[Canadian Tulip Festival|Tulip Festival]] in Ottawa, Canada, and Motionfest in Baltimore, USA.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}
  
From 2007 until 2010 he taught Clown Retreats in Wanganui, New Zealand and this programme has now been expanded to include a 3-week Summer School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artmedia.com.au/Clown.htm |title=Clown Training |publisher=Artmedia.com.au |date=17 February 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3440">'''Alfred Moul''' (c. 1852 – 18 January 1924) was a composer, pianist, agent, critic, and impresario. His origins are uncertain, but there is some evidence that he was from Australia.&lt;ref name=skinner&gt;Skinner, Graham.

He performed and composed, and from mid-1880 was music critic of two [[Melbourne]] papers.&lt;ref name=skinner/&gt;

In 1883 Moul returned to England, where he became managing director of the [[Alhambra Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=skinner/&gt; For [[Queen Victoria]]'s diamond jubilee in 1897 he commissioned [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ballet ''[[Victoria and Merrie England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn (1993). Notes to Marco Polo CD 8.223677&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion he would compose additional music for the shows he presented at the Alhambra, and he contributed to productions at other theatres, such as the London versions of [[Frédéric Toulmouche]]'s ''The Wedding Eve'' (1892) and [[Charles Lecocq]]'s ''[[Le coeur et la main|Incognita]]'' (also 1892).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3362423 "The Wedding Eve"], ''The Musical Times'', October 1892, p. 601 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; For such compositions he used the pen name "Yvolde".&lt;ref name=skinner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Comic Opera Season", ''The Graphic'', 17 September 1892, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; For the Alhambra, known for its popular ballets, he wrote the score of one of the most successful, ''Psyche'' (1909).&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Moul remained closely connected with the Alhambra for many years, holding at various times the post of managing director or chairman (and both concurrently from 1906 to 1911).&lt;ref name=st&gt;[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/126057636?searchTerm=Alfred%20Moul%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;searchLimits=#"Mr Alfred Moul"], ''[[The Sunday Times (Sydney)|The Sunday Times]]'', 19 May 1912, p.  20&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also prominent in the campaign to secure authors' and composers' intellectual property rights.

'''''American Girl''''' is a series of video games developed by various studios and distributed by [[American Girl]].

Games in the ''American Girl'' series are based upon characters and stories set within the toy line's [[fictional universe]], from historical-era characters like [[Kit Kittredge]], to contemporary ones such as those from the ''Girl of the Year'' line or ''WellieWishers''. Common gameplay elements within the series center upon educational activities, mostly focusing around American history and culture, though other aspects such as adventure, puzzle or even action elements are occasionally interspersed in some of the games.

===Edutainment games===
The first two games in the series marked American Girl's (then known as Pleasant Company) expansion into video games. They featured American Girl's historical character roster, which of the time consisted of six characters representing various periods of American history.

*'''''[[The American Girls Premiere]]''''' is the first entry in the series, developed and published by The Learning Company for American Girl and released in 1997 for personal computer platforms. The game allows the creation and direction of unique stage plays starring the Historical Characters, from Felicity Merriman to Molly McIntire. The Second Edition release, which was released in 1998, adds Josefina Montoya to the roster.
*'''''[[The American Girls: Dress Designer]]''''' is the second entry in the series, developed and released by Mattel Interactive for Windows in 1999. This was essentially an interactive version of the paper doll sets American Girl sold featuring their Historical Characters roster, from colonial era Felicity Merriman to [[World War II]]-era Molly McIntire. The game allows players to create and edit period clothes for the historical characters. Users can choose between different patterns, styles, designs and trim for each character, and they can also build and print out a fashion portfolio.

Besides ''Premiere'' and ''Dress Designer'', Mattel Interactive also published '''''Your Notebook (with help from Amelia)''''', a software toy in the form of an interactive journal based on the ''[[Amelia's Notebooks]]'' children's book series by [[Marissa Moss]], under the American Girl banner in 1999. Developed by [[KnowWonder]], ''Your Notebook'' allowed the user to write their own journals with the help of the titular protagonist, and comes with stamps, text effects and styles to which the user can add to their entries.

===Games published by [[THQ]]===
In the late 2000s American Girl collaborated with THQ for a number of games based on their franchise. Three of the games were released exclusively for Microsoft Windows, all of which are presented in a [[2.5D]] isometric viewpoint using pre-rendered characters and backgrounds, while the other two, namely ''Julie Finds a Way'' and ''Kit Mystery Challenge'', are released for the [[Nintendo DS]].

*'''''[[American Girl: Julie Saves The Eagles]]''''' is the third entry in the series, developed by ImaginEngine and the first to be published by THQ for American Girl on October 15, 2007 for Microsoft Windows. The main goal in the game is to help Julie find ways to finance an eagle release. The game, along with ''Mia Goes for Great'' and ''A Treehouse of My Own'', uses the open-source [[FreeType]] font rendering engine, as well as the [[Lua (programming language)|Lua programming language]] for most of the game's logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Julie Saves The Eagles|developer=[[ImaginEngine]]|publisher=[[THQ]]|date=2007-10-15|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]]|version=1.0|level=Readme.txt|quote=Uses Lua 5.1 Copyright (C) 2003-2006 Tecgraf, PUC-Rio.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also won a [[Parents' Choice Award]] from the non-profit Parents' Choice Foundation in 2008.&lt;ref name="PCAJulie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=23735&amp;StepNum=1&amp;award=aw|title=American Girl: Julie Saves the Eagles|work=Parents' Choice Foundation|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''[[American Girl: Julie Finds a Way]]''''' is the fourth entry in the series based on Julie's stories, developed by [[Webfoot Technologies]] and released by [[THQ]] on December 3, 2007 for the [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref name="DeVries"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/17/american-girl-julie-finds-a-way-review|title=American Girl: Julie Finds a Way Review|last=DeVries|first=Jack|date=16 January 2008|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game loosely follows the plot of the series; throughout the game various mini games are interspersed into the plot. The game also offers two-player [[multiplayer]] with three of the mini games. The game's world is divided into different zones, similar to ''[[Postal 2]]'', rather than in a single continuous map like in the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series of games. Entrances to other areas are usually denoted by a [[Skybox (video games)|lower-quality backdrop]] of the zone to be visited, or an interior model with a lower [[level of detail]].
*'''''[[American Girl: Mia Goes for Great]]''''' is the fifth entry in the series, based on the 2008 Girl of the Year Mia St. Clair, released in February 4, 2008 for Microsoft Windows. The game lets players participate in a number of [[figure skating competition]]s. It also features a program builder allowing players to design and customize practice routines for Mia.
*'''''[[American Girl: Kit Mystery Challenge|Kit Mystery Challenge]]''''' is the sixth entry in the series, developed by Webfoot Technologies and released by THQ in 2008 for the Nintendo DS.&lt;ref name="DeVries2"/&gt; The game loosely follows the events of the ''Kit Kittredge'' story arc, although unlike in Julie Finds a Way, the game is presented as a mystery-solving game in the vein of the ''[[Nancy Drew#Computer games|Nancy Drew]]'' series, and does not offer a multiplayer component. Core gameplay consists of mystery-solving elements, with players being presented in a third-person viewpoint. The player is tasked to look for clues to be used as evidence, interrogate suspects or ask for leads, and analyze all the evidence and facts gathered in order to solve the case. Players can also engage in a number of side missions, such as selling eggs to neighbors and other people around the city, or running errands for cash, which can be spent on various perks, upgrades and other items, like buying food supplies or paying part of the house's mortgage.
*'''''[[American Girl: Kit - A Tree House of My Own]]''''' is the seventh entry in the series, also based on Kit's story arc, developed by ImaginEngine in collaboration with Bon Art Studio and published by THQ in June 23, 2008.&lt;ref name="kittredge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonartstudio.com/bonart_studio_project_50_THQ__Backbone_Entertainment_American_Girl:_A_Tree_House_of_My_Own.html|title=Bon Art Studio: High Quality Art Solutions and Services for Game Developers, Publishers and Producers|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is composed of several [[minigames]], such as a [[Puzzle Bobble]] clone, an [[anagrams]] game, and a few others. Players are also rewarded with tools and other prizes that Kit needs to start her own treehouse.

==Common elements==
{{expand section|date=September 2016}}
Most games in the series puts players in the role of an American Girl character, typically a Historical/BeForever character like [[Kit Kittredge]] or a contemporary one such as any of the Girl of the Year characters like Grace Thomas, Isabelle Palmer or Lea Clark. The games' presentation may vary from one title to the next, from an edutainment game typical of ''The American Girls Premiere'' and ''Dress Designer'', a ''[[Nancy Drew#Computer games|Nancy Drew]]''-esque mystery as seen in ''Kit Mystery Challenge'', to an action-adventure platform game as seen in ''Lea Born for Adventure''.

==History==
{{expand section|date=September 2016}}
The first game in the series, ''[[The American Girls Premiere]]'' for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS Classic|Mac OS]], marked the debut of [[Pleasant Company]] into the digital software space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-56416072.html|title=All dolled up but nowhere to go|last=Ray|first=Robin|date=October 26, 1997|work=The Boston Herald|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Ehrmann, vice president of Internet business strategy consulting firm Grey Interactive, said that the video game had a due potential as it was entering a relatively untapped market, commenting that in the interactive media space, "girls are for the most part totally ignored."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22965166.html|title=SOFTWARE DESIGNERS GET WITH THE PROGRAM -- AT LAST, THEY'RE DISCOVERING GIRLS|last=|first=|date=November 9, 1997|work=The Buffalo News|access-date=|via=Highbeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The American Girls Premiere'' was released to mostly positive reception, and received accolades from various parenting organizations; subsequent games in the series however received tepid to negative scores from gaming publications - ''American Girl: Kit Mystery Challenge'' for example was panned for its repetitive gameplay, controls and lack of replay value.&lt;ref name="DeVries2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/08/01/american-girl-kit-mystery-challenge-review|title=American Girl: Kit Mystery Challenge Review|last=DeVries|first=Jack|date=1 August 2008|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Canada (Labour Relations Board) v Paul L'Anglais Inc''''' [1983] 1 S.C.R. 147 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] constitutional decision on the jurisdiction of the superior courts to hear constitutional arguments. The unanimous Court found that Courts of Inherent Jurisdiction such as the [[Quebec Superior Court]] had concurrent jurisdiction to hear constitutional cases.

==Background==
A series of companies were involved in the production of several television shows and sold air time to sponsors. The CUPE union brought a claim against the companies to [[Canada Industrial Relations Board]]. CUPE applied to have the companies declared a single party for the purposes of a collective bargaining proceedings. The companies argued that it was impossible as some of them were not inter-provincial companies and thus were outside of federal jurisdiction.

The CLRB found that the companies were a federal undertaking and so granted CUPE's application. The companies, in turn, applied to the [[Quebec Superior Court]] for a writ of evocation. The Superior Court denied the application on grounds that they did not have jurisdiction as the Federal Court Act gave the power to hear this sort of case to the Federal Court. On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal the court held that the Superior Court had jurisdiction and granted the writ of evocation.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Superior Court had jusidction over constitutional issues.

==Opinion of the Court==
The unanimous Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal. The opinion was given by Chouinard J.

Chouinard acknowledged the fact that the Federal Court Act gave jurisdiction to the Federal Courts on matters of federal agencies. However, the Act "does not apply to supersede the superintending and reforming power of the Superior Court". The federal government can create a court "for the better administration of the laws of Canada" as per section 101 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]. Such a court may be given exclusive power over the application of federal laws.  However, s 101 does not grant the federal government authority to remove the power of superior courts to determine the constitutionality of federal laws. The government can only create [[concurrent jurisdiction]] rather than [[exclusive jurisdiction]].

In the end Chouinard held that the companies were not engaged in matters within the federal powers by creating TV programming and so the CLRB did not have jurisdiction over the dispute. Instead the superior courts had jurisdiction. The Court affirmed the Court of Appeal's granting of the writ.

==Aftermath==
The case largely established concurrent jurisdiction between statutory courts and courts of inherent jurisdiction. However, in later decisions such the jurisdiction trilogy of ''Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario'', Douglas College case, and the Tétreault-Gadoury case, have seemingly reversed the ruling with little mention of the case itself.

'''Crown and Anchor''' is a simple [[dice]] game, traditionally played for [[gambling]] purposes by sailors in the [[Royal Navy]] as well as those in the British merchant and fishing fleets.

==History==
The game originated in the 18th century. It is still popular in the [[Channel Islands]] and [[Bermuda]], but is strictly controlled and may be played legally only on certain occasions, such as the Channel Islands' three annual agricultural shows, or Bermuda's annual Cup Match [[cricket]] game.

Three special dice are used in Crown and Anchor. The dice are equal in size and shape to standard dice, but instead of one through six pips, they are marked with six symbols: crown, anchor, diamond, spade, club and heart. (The last four are the same symbols used on [[playing cards]].)

==Rules of play==
[[Image:Krone und Anker.jpg|thumb|Crown and Anchor playing mat and dice]]
The game is played between a player and a banker. A canvas or felt mat marked with the six symbols is used for play. The player places bets on one or more symbols. He then throws the three dice. If there is a bet on any symbol which comes up on one or more of the dice, in addition to returning the stake the banker pays the player the amount of his stake for each die showing that symbol: even money if one, 2:1 if two, and 3:1 if three. If the symbol doesn't come up, the player loses his bet.

The expected return of a $1 wager on a particular symbol is calculated as follows:
* The chance of the symbol coming up on none of the dice is 5/6 × 5/6 × 5/6, which is 125/216. The player loses $1 in this case.
* The chance of the symbol coming up on all three dice is 1/6 × 1/6 × 1/6, which is 1/216. The player wins back the $1 plus $3 more.
* The chance of the symbol coming up on two of three dice is C(3,1) x 1/6 × 1/6 × 5/6, which is 15/216. The player wins back the $1 plus $2 more.
* The chance of the symbol coming up on one of three dice is C(3,1) × 1/6 × 5/6 × 5/6, which is 75/216. The player wins back the $1 plus $1 more.
In total, the expected return of a $1 wager is ((+$3 × 1) + (+$2 × 15) + (+$1 × 75) + (-$1 × 125))/216, or ($3 + $30 + $75 - $125)/216, which is (-$17)/216 ≈ -$0.078704.

Put another way, for every $1.00 wagered, a player can expect to receive back $0.921296.
Thus, the banker has a substantial edge. In a game at a festival or casino, the house will be banker. In a game among friends, each person serves as banker in turn.

==Variations==
A similar version of the game is played in [[Nepal]], called "Langur Burja" ({{lang-ne|लङ्गुर बुर्जा}}). There is a similar [[Flanders|Flemish]] version called ''Anker en Zon'' ("Anchor and Sun"), in which a sun symbol replaces the crown. The [[France|French]] version again uses the sun, and is called ''Ancre, Pique, et Soleil'' ("Anchor, Spade, and Sun"). A similar game played in [[China]] called ''[[Hoo Hey How]]'' ({{lang|zh|魚蝦蟹}}, Fish-Prawn-Crab in [[Hokkien]]) and [[Vietnam]] called  or ''[[Bau cua ca cop|Bầu cua cá cọp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gamer'' 1981 p17 "In Britain, the game is Crown and Anchor and is played with dice spotted (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Crown and Anchor). In part of the Far East, the game is Hoo Hey How and the dice are spotted (Fish, Prawn, King Crab, Butterfly,"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Sidney Parlett ''The Oxford History of Board Games'' (1999), p.31: "A substantially similar game is played by the Chinese under the title Hoo-Hey-How, or, more picturesquely, Fish-Prawn-Crab, the six compartments and dice-sides being marked respectively with a fish, a prawn, a king crab, a flower, ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
*Crown and Anchor is one of the dice games played in the British detective series ''[[Foyle's War]]'', episode 15, "Casualties of War."
*The game is mentioned in Terry Pratchett's book ''[[Dodger (novel)|Dodger]]''.
*The game plays a significant part in [[Ronald Hugh Morrieson]]'s novel ''[[Came a Hot Friday]]'', which suggests that the game was popular (although possibly not legal) in New Zealand at the time.
*In [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' ''[[Busman's Honeymoon]]'' (1937), two "lads" play the game on the steps of the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Chapel]].
*The [[Royal Caribbean International]] customer loyalty program is named the Crown &amp; Anchor Society.

==Plot==
In [[northwest China]], 48 BC (50 BC on screen in the English version), a security company under [[Han China]]'s current government called [[The Silk Road]] Protection Squad is committed to stopping battles and promoting the idea of peace. Huo An (Jackie Chan), the captain, successfully averts a battle between the [[Indian people|Indians]] and [[Han dynasty|Han Chinese]]. The group returns to their unnamed home city, where Huo An's gentle [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] wife Xiuqing (Mika Wang) serves as a schoolteacher for orphans. However, the government uncovers evidence that someone in the group is corrupt, causing the entire group to be sentenced to construction work at Wild Geese Gate, a ruined fortress. Once they arrive, the group pays respects at the shrine of a fallen Chinese general. They originally were child-slaves of Han descent, but the general had later rescued them.

Not long after, Wild Geese Gate is threatened by a [[Roman legion|legion]] from the [[Roman Empire]] in need of water and supplies, among which is a blind boy named Publius ([[Jozef Waite]]). After a stale-mated duel between Huo An and Lucius (Cusack), the Roman general, the latter agrees not to assault the city in return for being let inside. The legion uses its superior [[Roman engineering|engineering]] skills to speed up the construction work, an act which boosts the morale and happiness of the inhabitants, who are divided among several different ethnic groups, such as Chinese, Uyghur, and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]]. Huo An returns the favor by sending men to assist Lucius's envoys in reaching the [[Parthian Empire]]. A celebration is later held and Huo An is made an honorary centurion.

Lucius reveals that he and Publius are fleeing from Publius's brother Tiberius (Brody), a corrupt soldier who murdered their father, a [[Roman consul]], and blinded Publius so Tiberius could become consul. As Tiberius approaches with 100,000 soldiers, Huo An insists on helping Lucius, pointing out that Tiberius is a threat to the Silk Road in its entirety. Shortly after Huo An leaves to find reinforcements, the corrupt group member from earlier sends Chinese soldiers to murder Xiuqing and attack Wild Geese Gate. The legion is imprisoned in the non-Chinese trading city of [[Kroran]], where Tiberius has chosen to camp. Tiberius proceeds to murder Publius.

Huo An and the few loyal Chinese soldiers travel to Kroran, pretending to surrender, but once they are inside, they destroy the Roman legion's cages. Huo An breaks into Lucius's special solitary cell, but is unable to free him. A fire breaks out, whereupon Lucius calls out to Huo An to 'take me home', and Huo An shoots an arrow to kill Lucius before the fire gets him.  As Huo An's and Lucius's soldiers are surrounded, the armies of several other nations arrive and fight against Tiberius, including the Indians, Han, Uyghurs, and Turkics, all of whom are determined to preserve the Silk Road's safety. However, even their combined forces are unable to gain the upper hand. Finally, the envoys from earlier return with a massive host of Parthians, who had signed a special treaty with Publius's father and who intend to avenge his memory. Tiberius's soldiers lose their will to fight. Huo An challenges Tiberius to a duel and kills him.

Upon hearing about the bravery of Lucius's legion, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]] grants them the right to establish their own city, which they choose to name Regum. They accept Huo An as their commander, and Huo An, in turn, honors the deceased Chinese general by relocating the shrine to that city. As the centuries go on, the city fades from [[collective memory]]. However, in the modern day, a team of Asian American archaeologists stumble upon the site and uncover the dual Chinese and Latin inscriptions.

==Production==

===Casting===
For the role of the Roman general, Lucius, Australian actor [[Mel Gibson]] was initially rumored to be taking the role. During a press conference, neither Chan nor Lee confirmed Gibson's participation and Chan only said,
{{cquote|All I can say is that he’s a foreigner – an A-list Hollywood star, a big name.&lt;ref name="team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24-7kpop.com/jackie-chan-teams-up-with-mel-gibson-and-siwon-for-dragon-blade/|title=Jackie Chan Teams Up With Mel Gibson and Siwon For "Dragon Blade"?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ultimately, the role went to [[John Cusack]].

===Filming===
[[Principal photography]] for ''Dragon Blade'' started on 15 April 2014 in [[Hengdian World Studios|Hengdian]], China with some battle scenes. The cast and crew encountered difficult filming conditions due to the heat, their heavy costume and long filming hours. Two days later, a press conference for ''Dragon Blade'' was held at the [[Beijing]] International Film Festival where star [[Jackie Chan]] and director [[Daniel Lee (film director)|Daniel Lee]] attended and announced the film to be released in [[IMAX 3D]] on 19 February 2015, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year. Aside from Hengdian, production took place in [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Gobi Desert]].&lt;ref name="奉旨出征"/&gt;

The film was shot with a budget of US$65 million.&lt;ref name=hollywoodreporterfest/&gt; The film was financed by Sparkle Roll Media Corporation, Huayi Brothers Media Corporation, Shanghai Film Group, Home Media &amp; Entertainment Fund, Tencent Video and the Beijing Cultural Assets Chinese Film and Television Fund.&lt;ref name=fund&gt;{{cite web|title=John Cusack, Adrien Brody join Jackie Chan's Dragon Blade|url=http://www.screendaily.com/territories/asia-pacific/cusack-brody-join-dragon-blade/5073166.article|publisher=[[Screen International]]|date=15 June 2014|accessdate=19 June 2014|quote=Dragon Blade is financed by Sparkle Roll Media Corporation, Huayi Brothers Media Corporation, Shanghai Film Group, Home Media &amp; Entertainment Fund, Tencent Video and Beijing Cultural Assets Chinese Film and Television Fund.

===Critical reception===
''Dragon Blade'' has received mixed reception, with much of the praise directed towards its large-scale battle sequences, production design, and mixing of styles from both Hollywood and East Asian cinema. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 34% approval rating and [[rating average]] score of 4.3/10. The site's consensus reads, "''Dragon Blade'' is beautifully staged and choreographed, but between the battles, its talented cast is overwhelmed by a dull story and choppy editing."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tian_jiang_xiong_shi/|title=Tian Jiang Xiong Shi (Dragon Blade) (2015)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Maggie Lee applauded the film for its overall technical details and concluded it to be "a colossal entertainment with solid technique and terrific storytelling smarts".&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/film-review-dragon-blade-1201440491/|title=File Review: 'Dragon Blade'|author=Maggie Lee|publisher=Variety|date=26 February 2015|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarence Tsui of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' complimented ''Dragon Blade'' for its filmmaking quality and screenplay for a primarily mainland Chinese production.&lt;ref =hollywood&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/dragon-blade-tian-jiang-xiong-777638|title='Dragon Blade'('Tian Jiang Xiong Shi'): Film Review|author=Clarence Tsui|date=26 February 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]] awarded it a score of 6 out of 10, saying "The story is rubbish, but ''Dragon Blade'' has some cool fight scenes thanks to Jackie Chan's action direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/09/03/dragon-blade-review |title=Dragon Blade Review - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=2015-09-03 |accessdate=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a negative review, Gabriel Chong from MovieXclusive.com panned ''Dragon Blade'' as being "utterly awful in every respect", criticizing the performances of the starring cast and inconsistent changes in tone. He writes: "Indeed, ''Dragon Blade'' is a hot mess and a spectacular misfire, not just by its star but also by its director, and if anything, further confirms that the once-promising careers of Hollywood stars [[John Cusack]] and [[Adrien Brody]] are going the way of [[Nicolas Cage]]".&lt;ref name=moviexclusive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviexclusive.com/movie/dragon-blade-22825235583859629422-2015|title=DRAGON BLADE(天将雄狮)(2015)|author=Gabriel Chong|publisher=MovieXclusive.com|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian media gave overwhelmingly negative review on the movie. Claiming the movie to be "a Chinese propagandist film", ''[[The Hindu|The Hindu's]]'' Venky Vembu criticized the film's lack of subtle messages and disapproved of the characterizations, writing: "I watched this film in 3D, but given the two-dimensional nature of the cardboard characters, I don't think the third D would have vastly enhanced my view experience."&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-reviews/dragon-blade-review-the-rebranding-of-jackie-chan/article7043480.ece | title=Dragon Blade: The rebranding of Jackie Chan | work=[[The Hindu]] | date=28 March 2015 | accessdate=20 June 2015 | author=Venky Vembu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]] also labeled the film as "Chinese torture", but did commend the film for its action choreography and Jackie Chan's performance as the Chinese General Huo An: "With ample footage in action and emotional scenes, [Huo An] is one of the best characters Chan has portrayed in recent years."&lt;ref name="businessstandard"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/dragon-blade-a-chinese-torture-lost-in-translation-ians-movie-review-115032700618_1.html | title='Dragon Blade' - A Chinese torture, lost in translation (IANS Movie Review) | work=[[Business Standard]] | date=27 March 2015 | accessdate=20 June 2015 | agency=[[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ennahar TV''' ({{lang-ar|تلفزيون النهار}}) is an Arabic language [[Satellite television|satellite]] [[television channel]] broadcasting from [[Bir Mourad Rais]]. Ennahar TV was set up by Groupe Ennahar and a number of Arab [[intellectuals]] from [[Algeria]] and the [[Arab World]].

==History==
Ennahar TV started broadcasting in test mode on 6 March 2012 satellite ([[Nilesat]]), since the capital [[jordan]]aise [[Amman]]. It opened its programming by broadcasting the first [[TV news|news]] by the duo Riyadh Benamar and Nour El Yakin Meghriche.&lt;ref&gt;http://algeria.clubme.net/t29628-topic/&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the Ministry of Communication confirmed the granting of approval to Ennahar TV, next to [[Echourouk TV]] and [[El Djazairia]]. This administrative authorization is provisional, valid until 31 December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexpressiondz.com/culture/lecran_libre/171909-numidia-news-dzair-tv-et-atlas-tv-preferent-attendre.html|title=L'Expression - Le Quotidien - Numidia News, Dzaïr TV et Atlas TV préfèrent attendre|website=www.lexpressiondz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2013, Ennahar Documentaries, a sister channel of Ennahar TV, was launched on Nilesat. The latter continuously broadcast reports and documentaries from the Ennahar TV catalog. This system was stopped a few days after its launch.

In 2014, the chain was controversial when it broadcast a report on university residences for girls in [[Algeria]]. The chain has been often accused of sensationalism.

On 28 November 2014 was launched Zahra DZ (now known as Ennahar Laki), a chain of Ennahar group dedicated to women in Algeria. This channel broadcast [[Television Series|soap operas]] [[Arab world|Arabic]] or [[Turkey|Turkish]] dubbed in [[Arab]] but also rebroadcast some magazines mother string as ''Nahar.com or'' ''Mag-Zoom.''

In April 2015, the president of the audiovisual regulatory authority (ARAV), Miloud Chorfi Ennahar TV began a series of meetings with various stakeholders, including with Anis Rahmani, general manager of Ennahar group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ennaharonline.com/fr/news/32965.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2015, at the 9th edition of the Media Star,&lt;ref&gt;Digital Star is an annual ceremony hosted by [[Ooredoo (Algeria)|Ooredoo Algeria]] which recognizes the best journalistic traveaux and honors professionals in the media field.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibtissam Bouslama, a journalist of Ennahar TV won the second prize in the category "audiovisual production" for ithets report entitled "Cybercrime" which was broadcast by the antenna of the chain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ennaharonline.com/fr/news/32965.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Ennahar TV was called to order by ARAV for broadcasting a report that presented the general secretary [[Workers' Party (Algeria)|Workers Party]], [[Louisa Hanoune]], as a woman who "encourages corruption." Miloud Chorfi, director of ARAV, summoned the head of the string editor for contacting him warning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.algerie-focus.com/2015/12/133198/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2016, throughout the morning until 11 o'clock, Ennahar TV displayed a black screen. According to a news channel published on its website, there was a technical failure due to a cutting of a fiber optic cable in [[Egypt]] at 6:50, which also affected several other channels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsa-algerie.com/20160124/ecran-noir-sur-ennahar-tv/&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2016, the headquarters of Ennahar TV [[Algiers]] was renamed in the name of the deceased Mujahid Moukkadem Ben Slimane. This renaming was accompanied by a ceremony attended by the widow of the mujahid, the Minister of Mujahideen Tayeb Zitouni and the President of the National Front for Social Justice Khaled Bounedjma.&lt;ref&gt;http://ennaharonline.com/fr/news/40676.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernest Gustav Brandon-Cremer''' (15 February 1895 – 1 March 1957) was a New Zealand/Australian moviemaker, newsman, explorer and adventurer. He was a key figure in Australian aviation history, and was especially known for his documentation of [[Lasseter's Reef|Lasseter's Gold Reef]] as well as his photography of the [[Solar eclipse of 21 September 1922]] at [[Wallal]], Australia.

== Early life ==
In Dunedin, New Zealand, Brandon-Cremer was born to [[Albert Wilhelm Anton Brandon-Cremer]] and Annie Beaton in a theatrical family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/67803392|title=Amusements|work=Advocate|location=Burnie, Tasmania|date=14 March 1929|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/27094912|title=Still Acts at 80 Years of Age|work=The Mercury|location=Hobart, Tasmania|date=19 June 1952|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; his parents traversing New Zealand and Australia by horse and carriage over several decades in the early days of vaudeville in Australasia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/67803392|title=Amusements|date=14 March 1929|work=Advocate|location=Burnie, Tasmania|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/27094912|title=Still Acts at 80 Years of Age|date=19 June 1952|work=The Mercury|location=Hobart, Tasmania|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His childhood was marked by a never present father and an alcoholic mother, a marriage soon to be dissolved with the children abandoned to the State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/167207632|title=Theatrical Divorce Case|work=Sydney Sportsman|location=Surry Hills, New South Wales|date=31 May 1905|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandon-Cremer ran away from home at 11 and had to fend for himself. Brandon-Cremer claims that he was taken in by a travelling American minister and he ended up spending the next 6 years in Hollywood.

In 1913, he was tried in [[Adelaide]] for breaking and entering, including theft, and sentenced to 18 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/210006424|title=A Housebreaker Caught|work=The Express and Telegraph|location=Adelaide, South Australia|date=6 May 1913|page=1|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later court visit for vagrancy in June 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/153603251|title=Camberwell Police Court|work=Camberwell and Hawthorn Adviser|location=Victoria|date=10 July 1915|page=7|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed he was now in Melbourne. In both instances he listed his profession as [[cinematographer]], a craft he repeatedly contended to have picked up on his travels to Hollywood; in one statement, he indicated that he worked for the &amp;nbsp;[[Vitagraph Company of America|Vitagraph&amp;nbsp;Company of&amp;nbsp;America,]] beginning in 1910.

Newspaper notices and advertisements show that Brandon-Cremer worked as a cinematographer with A. C. Tinsdale starting in 1915,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/154811358|title=Local Moving Pictures|work=The Ballarat Star|location=Victoria|date=3 April 1917|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; a relationship that would last many years, and would benefit him greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/83117474|title=Dangerous Neglect|work=the Daily News|location=Perth, West Australia|date=5 December 1921|page=4|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1917 Brandon-Cremer became second wireless operator aboard the Steamship 'Boonah' as he headed for the UK.&lt;ref name="Stranded in London"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/83116722|title=Stranded in London|work=The Daily News|location=Perth, Western Australia|date=1 December 1921|page=7|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1917 he joined the [[Royal Garrison Artillery|British Garrison Artillery]] (BGA), part of the UK [[Royal Horse Artillery]] as a gunner (serial no. 198613). It seems he never saw active service over his 18 months with the BGA, but did qualify for several medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D2001630|title=Medal Card of Ernest Brandon Cremer as Ernest B Cremer|work=UK National Archives|location=London|via=UK National Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; In press interviews later in life, Brandon-Cremer said he was "associated" with the R.A.F. and consequently saw service with the [[Polar Bear Expedition|British North Russian Relief Force]]&amp;nbsp;in Russia during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/41208395|title=Making Movies|date=23 August 1933|work=Cairns Post|location=Queensland|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took part in the evacuation of [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]] in northern Russia) in late 1919&lt;ref name="Daring Death in Keystone Army"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/234279275|title=Daring Death in Keystone Army|date=1 July 1922|work=Smith's Weekly|location=Sydney, New South Wales|page=13|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated he earned the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], (not verified){{Citation needed|date=October 2017|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence}} and displayed this medal (evidence of his flying ability can be found in the short travelogue "In and Around MacKay" (1933),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/172946282|title=Theatre Royal|date=7 June 1933|work=Daily Mercury|location=Mackay, Queensland|page=13|type=Advertisement|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he is seen in the cockpit flying above MacKay)

Upon his BGA discharge in February 1919, Brandon-Cremer started a 15-month stint with the London YMCA as a cinematographer.&lt;ref name="Stranded in London" /&gt; Two months later, on 19 April, he married Minnie Henrietta Warren. Minnie, age 22, from London. He listed his occupation as Film Operator. It seems Minnie died the following year .

In June 1920 Brandon-Cremer went to work in South Africa for a year making short films for the South African Film Trust.&lt;ref name="Stranded in London" /&gt; On 11 July 1921 he returned to the UK aboard the RMS 'Kinfauns' from South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== The Spanish Foreign Legion, 1921 ==
In August 1921, Brandon-Cremer travelled to Spain to join the [[Spanish Legion]] fighting the Moors (Rif) in North Africa, and participated in 11 battles. He was repatriated to the UK in November, giving interviews to the British press, representing himself as the only Australian (New Zealander) to join the Spanish Legion. He later claimed to have been under the command of then Capt. [[Francisco Franco]] (subsequent dictator of Spain).&lt;ref name="Daring Death in Keystone Army" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/41762761|title=General Franco|work=Cairns Post|location=Queensland|date=15 September 1936|page=11|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His accounts of the ill treatment of British recruits to the Spanish Legion were widely reported in American, British and Australian newspapers. Upon reading such reports, his former business partner, A. C. Tinsdale started a campaign to return Brandon-Cremer to Australia.&lt;ref name="Stranded in London" /&gt; It seems that this was accomplished as Brandon-Cremer returned to Albany, Western Australia aboard the MS [[MS Akaroa (1914)|Euripides]] on 9 March 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ListingReports/PassengerListing.aspx|title=Passenger List, Ernest returns to Australia|via=National Archives of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Eclipse at Wallal, Western Australia, 1922 ==
[[Wallal]], Western Australia was the chosen location for a visiting US [[Lick Observatory]] party of Astronomers, led by [[William Wallace Campbell|W. W. Campbell]], to view the upcoming [[Solar eclipse of 21 September 1922]]. The purpose of the expedition to view stellar transits of the Sun's disk during the eclipse to measure and verify [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Theory of relativity]]. Wallal was preferred for its isolation from man-made light sources, its propensity for clear skies and its location to gain the longest eclipse duration.

Brandon-Cremer, along with his business partner C. A.

== The 1920s and aerial exploits ==
During the 1920s Brandon-Cremer was working for Paramount Studios in Australia as a cameraman and filmmaker, he produced such films as 'Java: The Garden of the East' (only the script exists of this movie); Other films included 'Nursery Rhymes' with his father at Bronte Beach, Sydney and 'British Quality Triumphant' in 1925. A film about automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, tractors and aircraft built in Britain and transported for sale in Australia.

On 15 July 1925, Brandon-Cremer married a second time to Sara Inez Vera Bell in [[Queensland]].   Sara lost a newborn son, Anthony Brandon-Cremer on 14 March 1926, also in Queensland. The marriage dissolved shortly after.

Brandon-Cremer was active in covering aviation news and filming scenes in flight. He was instrumental in covering the arrival of the [[Southern Cross (aircraft)|Southern Cross]] on its journey on the first Trans-Pacific flight to Australia in 1928, piloted by his friend Charles Kingsford-Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/115414591|title=Film Scoop|work=Evening News|location=Sydney, New South Wales|date=12 June 1928|page=17|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year while covering the arrival of the 'British Super-marines' of the Royal Air Force from London to Sydney, he and his pilot Sturt Griffith ditched into [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]. Both men suffered minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57059950|title=Plane Accident|work=The Register|location=Adelaide, South Australia|date=2 August 1928|page=9|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later Brandon-Cremer was the observer for Gypsy-Moth deliveries between Melbourne and Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/16528024|title=Gypsy-Moth 'Plane|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=New South Wales|date=2 February 1929|page=16|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another newspaper article mentions his participation on filming the departure of the aeroplane 'Canberra' ([[de Havilland Giant Moth]]), An aerial expedition sent out to find the missing 'Southern Cross', piloted by Kingsford-Smith, on its attempted trip from Sydney to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/222963652|title=Canberra Film|work=The Sun|location=Sydney, New South Wales|date=10 July 1929|page=15|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Brandon-Cremer was included in a ride along on the [[Vickers Vellore|Vellore]] aeroplane journey from London to Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/233117111|title=Paramount News|work=The Magnet Mirror and Murchison Reflector|date=11 April 1929|page=1|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1930 Cinesound studios and Crew.jpg|thumb|Ernest Brandon-Cremer with the Cinesound crew Bondi Junction 1930]]
== Cinesound newsreels, 1930s ==
Brandon-Cremer worked for the newsreel producers [[Cinesound]] during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/41201916|title=Cinesound Newsreel|work=Cairns Post|location=Queensland|date=3 August 1933|page=6|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=digital%3D1070;page=0;parentid=;query=Bud%20Cramer;querytype=;rec=0;resCount=10|title=Cinesound's Camera and sound crew|location=Bondi studio|year=1930|via=National Film and Sound Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cinesound]] was a competitor to [[Movietone News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/118204047|title=Nostalgic Look at Australian Films|work=The Canberra Times|date=10 February 1986|page=25|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cinesound]] studio was based in Bondi Junction, Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/151993993|title=Cinesound Films|work=Mayborough Chronicle|date=15 December 1934|page=8|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cinesound]] cadre of cinematographers included Bill Carty, Joe Stafford, Arthur Smith, Bert Cross, Frank Bagnell, Clive Cross, [[Frank Coffey]], [[George Heath (cinematographer)|George Heath]], [[Frank Hurley]], Stan Murdoch, Bill Shepherd and George Malcolm.

== Lasseter's Reef of Gold, 1931 ==
The gold prospector [[Lewis Harold Bell Lasseter]] had become famous by telling the story of his outback survival and discovery of a massive reef of surface gold near [[Uluru]], Northern Territory. Members of the Sydney Stock Exchange organised the 'Central Australian Gold Exploration' Company (CAGE) to venture outback and rediscover this find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/224264190|title=New Company|work=The Sun|location=Sydney, New South Wales|date=24 June 1930|page=12|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/46589781|title=Central Australian Gold Exploration Co., Ltd|work=Barrier Miner|location=Broken Hill, New South Wales|date=23 July 1930|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camel trains and aircraft were sent out to scour the surrounds. One night during the expedition, Lasseter on camelback disappeared into the dark. After a futile search the party returned to Sydney.

A second Expedition was organised called CAGE-II.&lt;ref name="Gold Quest"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2253153|title=Gold Quest|work=The Canberra Times|location=Australian Capital Territory|date=17 August 1931|page=2|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1931, while working for Cinesound, 'Bud' signed-on with the Central Australian Gold Exploration Company (CAGE-II) to produce all the photography and a documentary film for a search party expedition to attempt to find Lasseter and his fabled reef of gold. The party to be led by local Bob Buck, a close friend of Brandon-Cremer.

The party left [[Alice Springs]] on Camel back en route to Uluru and the Western Ranges. A few hundred kilometres west of Uluru they discovered a tree with inscriptions and directions, left by Lasseter, to a river and cave. Upon digging a short while, Buck and Brandon-Cremer discovered the bones of [[Lewis Harold Bell Lasseter|Harold Lasseter]], and his diary. A subsequent search did not find the fabled reef of gold. The story has become Australian folklore and some still believe the reef of gold exists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/luke-walker-digs-up-a-hot-prospect-with-lasseters-bones/story-fn9n8gph-1226741606541&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Brandon-Cremer's photos were later published in the chronicle of [[Lasseter's Last Ride]] by [[Ion Idriess|Ion L. Idriess]]. The Mitchell Library in Sydney retains some of the photos taken during the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110045082|title=John Bailey collection of photographs showing Bob Buck leading the expedition to recover Lasseter's body in Central Australia|via=State Library of New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the CAGE-II Expedition as it was called, 'Bud' was credited in the ''Sydney Sunday Guardian'', in August 1931 – "Mr. Ernest Brandon-Cremer is the photographer. A complete moving picture record of the expedition's activities is to be taken by Mr. Cremer, who comes from Hollywood."&lt;ref name="Gold Quest" /&gt; He was also referenced for this Lasseter connection in the Horden House ''Encyclopedia of Exploration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hordern.com/explorers-encyclopedia/encyclopedia-of-exploration-4-people.php|title=Encyclopedia of Exploration 1850 to 1940|publisher=Hordern House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Go! Comi''' was the publishing imprint of the [[United States|American]] multimedia company, [[Go! Media Entertainment]], LLC,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-05-14/new-manga-publisher-announced-go-media-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; established to "specializ(e) in publishing Japanese comics for the American market, and in creating new manga and manga-oriented properties for both the Japanese and American markets."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gocomi.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Go! Comi was launched in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2005-05-14/new-manga-publisher-announced-go-media-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt; They published such best-selling series as the Eisner-nominated ''[[After School Nightmare]]'', ''[[Cantarella (manga)|Cantarella]]'', ''[[Her Majesty's Dog]]'', ''[[Tenshi Ja Nai]]!!'' and ''[[Crossroad (manga)|Crossroad]]''. The company's CEO was television writer [[David Wise (writer)|David Wise]].

The imprint was shut down during the manga bust that followed the recession.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/comics/article/56693-manga-2013-a-smaller-more-sustainable-market.html&lt;/ref&gt; The official website stopped being updated in early 2010 and expired in May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-05-11/go-comi-lets-its-website-expire&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the site was relaunched under new owners with instructions to donate to a PayPal account to revive the publisher, but former Go! Comi Creative Director Audry Taylor confirmed that the new website was a scam not associated with the defunct imprint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-05-12/go-comi-former-site-relaunched-under-false-pretenses&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">A '''Gramogram''' or '''Grammagram''' or '''Letteral Word''' is a letter or group of letters which can be pronounced to form one or more words, as in "CU" for "See you".&lt;ref name="high"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cryptic crossword reference lists &gt; Gramograms|url=http://www.highlightpress.com.au/gramograms.html|publisher=Highlight Press|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deal /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grammagrams|url=https://www.wordnik.com/lists/grammagrams|website=Wordnik|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a subset of [[rebus]]es,&lt;ref name=anil /&gt; and are commonly misunderstood for abbreviations.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

They are commonly used as a component of [[cryptic crossword]] clues.&lt;ref name=high /&gt;

A poem reportedly appeared in the ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'' of July 1903 using many grammagrams: it was preceded by the line "ICQ out so that I can CU have fun translating the sound FX of this poem".&lt;ref name=deal&gt;{{cite web|title=Grammagrams|url=http://www.audreydeal.co.uk/testlink|publisher=Audrey Deal|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A restaurant scene where a customer initially asks "FUNEX" ("Have you any eggs") appears in a 1949 book ''Hail fellow well met'' by [[Seymour Hicks]]&lt;ref name="hicks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hicks|first1=Sir Seymour|title=Hail Fellow Well Met|date=1949|publisher=Staples Press|page=183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fWUqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22have+you+any+eggs%22+funex&amp;dq=%22have+you+any+eggs%22+funex|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was performed in ''[[The Two Ronnies]]'' under the title ''Swedish made simple''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brennan|first1=Ailis|title=Ronnie Corbett dies: Here are his funniest seven sketches|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/ronnie-corbett-funniest-sketches|publisher=GQ|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''How to Double the Meaning of Life'' devotes three pages to gramograms, to which the author, Anil, gives the name '''Letteral words'''.&lt;ref name="anil"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anil|title=How to Double the Meaning of Life|publisher=Xlibris|isbn=9781462871209|pages=237–239|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=60MeAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;ots=1XBcOP65ST&amp;dq=gramogram%20meaning&amp;pg=PA237#v=onepage&amp;q=gramogram%20meaning&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 December 2016|chapter=Letteral Words|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|December 2016}} neither spelling of the word appears in the online ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

Some are homophones because some can be used for multiple words.

The '''history of Korean animation''', the manipulation of images to make them appear as moving, began with Japanese and American characters dominating the industry. The first sound animated character was created in 1936. The first feature-length animated character appeared in 1967. [[Dooly the Little Dinosaur]] revolutionized the character market in 1987. As animation characters specific to Korea appeared, the Korean character market continued to grow. Since then, Korean character franchises have even exported their characters to other countries.

== History ==
[[File:Pororo statues in Lotte world 2 Seoul South Korea.jpg|thumb|Pororo with Petty in [[Lotte World II Hotel]]]] [[File:Animation character Lava.jpg|thumb|Larva in the [[Lotte World II Hotel]]]]
[[File:타요버스 9401 가니 A01.JPG|thumb|Tayo bus 'Gani']] [[File:루돌프 타요.JPG|thumb|Tayo bus 'Rudolph']]
Han Chang-Wan, a professor at [[Sejong University]], published the history of animation character design in Korea at the Character Licensing Fair 2016. This study became the first to have rabbit and turtle illustrations as Korean animated characters. This was revealed in '[[Tongnip Sinmun|The Independent]]' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msn.com/ko-kr/news/other/%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD-%EC%BA%90%EB%A6%AD%ED%84%B0-%EB%B3%80%EC%B2%9C%EC%82%AC%EB%A5%BC-%EC%82%B4%ED%94%BC%EB%8B%A4%E2%80%A6%EC%BA%90%EB%A6%AD%ED%84%B0%C2%B7%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%84%A0%EC%8B%B1-%ED%8E%98%EC%96%B4/ar-BBujYiL|title=한국 캐릭터 변천사를 살피다…'캐릭터·라이선싱 페어'|last=Gu|first=Jungmo|date=2016-07-14|work=|publisher=MSN|publication-date=2016-07-14|trans-title=The history of Korean character...'Character·licensing fair'|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to records, the first sound animated character was 'Gaekkum' (개꿈), who was created in 1936. This first feature-length animated character appeared in 1967, in the namesake movie about a character named [[Hong Gildong jeon|Hong Gildong]] (홍길동).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://movie.naver.com/movie/magazine/magazine.nhn?nid=1270|title=한국 애니메이션 베스트 15|last=Kim|first=Hyungseok|date=2011-12-08|work=|publisher=Naver movie|publication-date=2011-12-08|trans-title=Best 15 of Korean animation|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With American and Japanese characters dominating the Korean animation industry until the 1970s, it wasn't until 1983 when Dooly the Little Dinosaur (아기 공룡 둘리) appeared in Bomulsum—a monthly magazine for kids—and changed the Korean character market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.daum.net/mocie/15613209|title=황글알을 낳는 거위! 떠오르는 '한국 캐릭터 산업'|last=Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy|first=Official blog|date=2013-04-19|work=|publisher=Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy|publication-date=2013-04-19|trans-title=The golden goose! Growing Korean character industries|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Dooly the Little Dinosaur first aired as a six-part TV show, with another seven parts airing in 1988. In 1995, [[Kim Soo-jung]], its creator, established a company named 'Dooly World' and went into the character design industry. The following year, the animated movie '[[Dooly the Little Dinosaur]]' was released. In the 30 years since Dooly the Little Dinosaur launched, its related market generated 2–3 billion [[South Korean won|won]] per year (about 1.7–2.7 million dollars as of July 2018). This paved the way for the character market in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/04/30/2013043002012.html|title='둘리' 이후 30년…캐릭터 시장 규모 8조원 육박'|last=No|first=Jawoon|date=2013-05-01|work=|publisher=Chosun Biz|publication-date=2013-05-01|trans-title=30 years after 'Dooly'… The size of Character market is closing in upon 8 trillion won|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Pororo the Little Penguin]] (뽀롱뽀롱 뽀로로) aired on [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]] and became the new representation of Korean animation characters. Pororo aired in 127 countries around the world and was the first domestic animation to make a contract with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] directly. It was estimated that its brand value was worth 850 billion won (about 750 million dollars) and its economic impact amounted to 5.7 trillion won (about 5 billion dollars) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businesspost.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1735|title=뽀로로는 왜 세계적 캐릭터가 됐을까|last=Choi|first=Yonghyeok|date=2014-05-02|work=|publisher=Business Post|publication-date=2014-05-02|trans-title=Why Pororo can be world wide character|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently, many other domestic Korean animations have gained popularity, such as [[Tobot]] (변신자동차 또봇), [[Larva (TV series)]] (라바), and [[Tayo the Little Bus]] (꼬마버스 타요).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.edaily.co.kr/news/NewsRead.edy?SCD=JI71&amp;newsid=01200486609466992&amp;DCD=A407&amp;OutLnkChk=Y|title='뽀로로'…130개국 수출 경제효과 6조 육박|last=Lee|first=Yoonjung|date=2015-08-13|work=|publisher=E daily|publication-date=2015-08-13|trans-title='Pororo'…Export for 130 countries around the world|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The animated [[Larva (TV series)]] (라바) recorded 10 billion won (about 9 million dollars) in sales in 2013. In addition, domestic characters such as [[Tayo the Little Bus]] have earned considerable sales due to the support of young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/04/30/2013043002012.html|title='둘리' 이후 30년…캐릭터 시장 규모 8조원 육박'|last=No|first=Jawoon|date=2013-05-01|work=|publisher=Chosun Biz|publication-date=2013-05-01|trans-title=30 years after 'Dooly'… The size of Character market is closing in upon 8 trillion won|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transition in character production methods ==
In the 1980s–1990s, cartoon characters expanded mainly because:

* comic books were popular.
* the characters of this period had great stories. 
* the symbolism in the images.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyeyoung Chu, hyunju Lee, Hyehyun Cho, Mirae Hwang|first=|date=Winter 2014|title=Periodic Features of Korean Character Designs|url=http://aodr.org/xml/01492/01492.pdf|journal=3.1 Period of Published Cartoon Characters (1980s~1990s)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2010, Flash characters became prevalent in Korea because:

* they facilitated production. In the files, scaling doen't affect quality and are much smaller, which increases speed of transmission.
* their popularity and rapid dissemination online. 
* story lines were aimed not only at children but also at adults.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyeyoung Chu, hyunju Lee, Hyehyun Cho, Mirae Hwang|first=|date=Winter 2014|title=Periodic Features of Korean Character Designs|url=http://aodr.org/xml/01492/01492.pdf|journal=3.2 Period of Two-Dimensional Flash Animated Characters (The early 2000s)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the decade, 3D animations were mainly done with 3D STUDIO MAX or MAYA software&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;OSMU is a kind of sales strategy that develops contents service on various media such as book, movie and game. It is referred to as Media franchise in America and Media mix in Japan.&lt;/ref&gt; and their production costs are much greater than for 2D Flash animations.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyeyoung Chu, Hyunju Lee, Hyehyun Cho, Mirae Hwang|first=|date=Winter 2014|title=Periodic Features of Korean Character Designs|url=http://aodr.org/xml/01492/01492.pdf|journal=3.3.

'''''Hot 92''''' is a [[pirate radio]] station in [[Birmingham]], England, which in October 2005, along with another local pirate station and a black interest website, reported rumours that a black girl was raped by a group of Asian men. This allegedly caused riots in the [[Lozells]] area of [[Birmingham]], leaving at least one person dead and 35 people injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-137934431.html|title=Two Afro-Caribbean Stations and a website in Britain today|date=25 October 2005|work=PTI - The Press Trust of India Ltd|accessdate=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4377112.stm|title=BBC News Magazine - Urban Pirates|date=26 October 2005|work=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Dan Whitehead, in a review for [[Eurogamer]], found the selection of games well chosen, enabling the show to cover the history of video games as fully as possible given its runtime.  He also praised the choice of [[pundit]]s, highlighting that even the most recognisable of names, such as [[Jonathan Ross]] and [[Peter Serafinowicz]], were included because they had a clear love of games and not for their celebrity appeal. Whitehead concluded that the show was a success, fun and informative, but also hampered by the format - having to cover the entirety of video gaming history in one show to an unfamiliar audience, a symptom of the lack of video games representation on television.&lt;ref name=Eurogamer/&gt;

Keith Stuart, who appeared on the show, reflected on its merits in a column for ''[[The Guardian]]''.  Stuart described how ending the show with Twitter was a clever way of showing how [[gamification]] has infiltrated everyday lives, with social networks relying on the same reward systems as video games.  Stuart liked how the show featured games like ''[[Papers, Please]]'', a game that explores guilt and the nature of evil, which helped to remove misconceptions that video games are incapable of exploring real-world issues.  Like Whitehead, Stuart concluded with a lament over the lack of video games coverage on television, criticising broadcasters for "ceding responsibility to [[YouTube]]rs and specialist online documentary makers" and for "failing their audiences".&lt;ref name=GuardianKS/&gt;  Sam Wollaston, also writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', gave a mixed review and was critical of the [[Pundit|talking heads]] format. Wollaston commented that despite containing interesting ideas, the show was overly long.  For [[gamer]]s however, Wollaston wrote that the show "would have been pretty much heaven".&lt;ref name=GuardianSW/&gt;

'''Jynx''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''Rougela'''|ルージュラ|Rūjura}}, is a [[List of Pokémon|Pokémon species]] in [[Nintendo]] and [[Game Freak]]'s ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise. Created by [[Ken Sugimori]], Jynx first appeared in the video games [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles, or animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. The character is voiced in Japanese by [[Mayumi Tanaka]] and by [[Rachael Lillis]] in English.

Jynx's design and humanoid appearance has been heavily criticized by the Western media, most notably by cultural critic [[Carole Boston Weatherford]], who described Jynx as representing [[blackface]] after seeing the character's depiction in the anime. Due to complaints, Game Freak modified its appearance by changing the original color of its face from black to the current color, purple.

Jynx was one of 151 different designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team and finalized by [[Ken Sugimori]] for the first generation of ''Pocket Monsters'' games ''Red'' and ''Green'', which were localized outside Japan as [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/vol1/index2.html|title=2. 一新されたポケモンの世界|page=2|work=Nintendo.com|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=2018-01-04|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965|title=Game Freak on Pokémon!|author=Stuart Bishop|work=[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]]|date=2003-05-30|accessdate=2008-02-07|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5VSJaR6xT?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=91965|archivedate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally called "Rujura" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features, when translating the game for western audiences, as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/99/1122/cover2.html|title=PokéMania|author1=Howard Chua-Euan|author2=Tim Larimer|date=1999-11-22|volume=154|number=20|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|agency=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they were renamed "Jynx", a play on the word "[[jinx]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12045/jynx.html|title=#124: Jynx|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also known as the "Human Shape" Pokémon, Jynx is a female-only species that resembles the Japanese mythical creatures [[Yamauba]] and [[Yuki-onna]]. Originally portrayed with a black face and hands, Jynx's design was changed to purple coloration after critiques that it perpetuated racism.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt; In addition Jynx have large pink lips, [[saucer]]-like eyes, white arms, and long, [[blond]] hair. The "clothes" they appear to wear are actually part of their body, resembling a circular red [[Brassiere|bra]] and [[skirt]]. Jynx have no visible feet, and in the games leave no footprints. Jynx has a pre-evolution, [[Smoochum]], which evolves into Jynx when it receives enough [[Experience point|experience]] from battles and reaches level 30.

Jynx Pokémon walk in a dance-like fashion, wiggling their hips in a manner described by Nintendo as "seductive".&lt;ref name="dexred"&gt;{{Pokédex|red|It seductively wiggles its hips as it walks. It can cause people to dance in unison with it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses dancing to communicate, with the exact rhythm relying on its emotion at the time. The dance affects people, causing them to themselves dance with no regard to their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Pokédex|ruby|Jynx walks rhythmically, swaying and shaking its hips as if it were dancing. Its motions are so bouncingly alluring, people seeing it are compelled to shake their hips without giving any thought to what they are doing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jynx speak in a language that only other Jynx can understand, though the sound is described as similar to human speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Pokédex|diamond|Its cries sound like human speech. However, it is impossible to tell what it is trying to say.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trait is carried on to games where Pokémon speak English such as the ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]'' series, with the text appearing as combinations of [[Hugs and kisses|"X"s, "O"s]], [[punctuation marks]], and/or musical notes, instead of legible words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team|''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team'' and ''Red Rescue Team'']]|developer=Chunsoft|publisher=Nintendo|date=2006-09-18|platform=Nintendo DS|quote=∞XO@#*~♪♪♪}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jynx are [[psychic]], and can attack either by kissing an opponent or launching "strange orbs" at them, and can protect themselves with a psychically-generated barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Pokémon Ranger]]|developer=HAL Laboratory|publisher=Nintendo|date=2006-10-30|platform=Nintendo DS|quote=Jynx swings its hips as if it's dancing while walking.

==Appearances==

===In video games===
In [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and their remakes, [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''Pokémon FireRed'' and ''LeafGreen'']], Jynx is a rare Pokémon that is only available through trading with an [[Non-player character|in-game NPC]]. In addition, the Kanto Elite Four member [[List of Pokémon characters#Kanto Elite Four|Lorelei]] uses a Jynx on her team. Jynx appears in the wild in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], ''[[Pokémon Platinum]]'', [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], and [[Pokémon X and Y|''Pokémon X'' and ''Y'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/pokedexloc.html|title=Pokémon Locations Listing|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the controversy of Jynx's skin, it was changed from black to purple in ''[[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'' and all later games. Jynx is the evolved form of [[Smoochum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guidesarchive.ign.com/guides/12865/8.html|title=Walkthrough - Ice Path|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the main series, Jynx appeared in ''[[Pokémon Snap]]'', ''[[Pokémon Pinball]]'', [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|''Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time'' and ''Explorers of Darkness'']], and the ''[[Pokémon Ranger]]'' games.

===In anime===
Jynx first appeared in the [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon anime]] in ''[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]'' when one of Santa Claus's Jynx was separated from him, [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]] and friends helped to return the Jynx to her owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Holiday Hi-Jynx|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Hideki Sonoda (writer)|network=Various|airdate=1999-12-11|season=1|number=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was not re-aired in USA because of the controversy over her appearance. However, it was placed on On-Demand on 2011, so people who live in USA could have easily viewed it then. Jynx appeared again in the episode ''[[The Ice Cave]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Ice Cave|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Yukiyoshi Ōhashi (writer)|network=Various|airdate=2002-05-30|season=3|number=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not aired in English-speaking countries for the same reason. Jynx also made a cameo as a doll that Misty wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Princess vs. Princess|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Junki Takegami (writer)|network=Various|airdate=1999-09-04|season=1|number=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jynx later appears in ''Pokémon Orange Islands'' series, in episodes still present in American rotations.

Jynx made an appearance in a contest in ''All Things Bright and Beautifly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=All Things Bright and Beautifly|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Atsuhiro Tomioka (writer)|network=Various|airdate=2003-12-27|season=6|number=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because Jynx had been animated with black skin instead of purple, her 13-second appearance was cut from the English dub. Jynx later appears in episodes 116 and 117 of ''[[Pokémon: Advanced Generation]]'', with the inoffensive purple skin color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Pacifidlog Jam|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Aya Matsui (writer)|network=Various|airdate=2006-04-08|season=6|number=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Berry, Berry Interesting|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Masashi Sogo (writer)|network=Various|airdate=2006-02-11|season=6|number=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the main order of these episodes would have been during February which is also [[Black History Month]], KidsWB chose to air these episodes out of order and air them in April after the Hoenn Championship League episodes as it would help build the ratings with the Grand Festival and Hoenn League episodes and it would have avoided offending people during February due to the Jynx controversy. However one exception was in the episode ''Hi Ho Silver Wind!'' where a purple Jynx had a minor cameo which aired in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hi Ho Silver Wind!|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Atsuhiro Tomioka (writer)|network=Various|airdate=2006-02-18|season=6|number=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; These episodes were aired in the normal rotational order in the UK. A trio of Jynx sisters were later depicted in the episode ''Three Jynx and a Baby''. These three Jynx were overly-protective towards their sister, a Smoochum. The Smoochum evolved into a Jynx at the end of the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Three Jynx and a Baby|series=[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]|credits=Junki Takegami (writer)|network=Various|airdate=2006-11-25|season=9|number=440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In printed material===
Jynx's most notable role in the [[Pokémon manga]] is being under the ownership of [[Lorelei (Pokémon)|Lorelei]] in [[Pokémon Adventures]]. Lorelei's Jynx is noted for having the ability to generate voodoo dolls out of ice using its Ice Beam. When Lorelei draws crosses on any part of the dolls using her lipstick, ice shackles form on the specified body parts of her targets, eventually freezing the victim over completely. Even after the victims are broken free, the freeze induces lasting numbness in the areas where it was applied. Both [[Red (Pokémon)|Red]] and [[Sabrina (Pokémon)|Sabrina]] suffered this condition and had to seek a cure atop Mt. Silver by bathing in the hotsprings there. Another ability of Lorelei's Jynx is revealed in the Sevii Islands saga: she can create a wispy band of ice around targets, with which Lorelei can use to track down using her powder case.

Jynx has made a number of appearances in the ''[[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]'', with the black-skinned design (sometimes US version cards show up purple and edited before the controversy) before the Weatherford controversy, and with the purple-skinned design after Nintendo regained control of the Pokémon TCG. Jynx first appeared in the Base Set with her black-skinned design, but later reprints of this card have the purple-skinned design.

==Controversy and reception==
[[File:Jynx-blackface.gif|left|thumb|140px|Jynx's original design has been heavily criticized as resembling [[blackface]] actors]]
Jynx's appearance and design have received criticisms in various publications. Children's book author and cultural critic [[Carole Boston Weatherford]] published an article in the ''[[News &amp; Record|Greensboro News &amp; Record]]'' alleging that Jynx's design bore a striking resemblance to [[blackface]] actors, an image considered [[racism|racist]] against black people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Politically Incorrect Pokémon, One Of The Pokémon Characters Reinforces An Offensive Racial Stereotype|author=[[Carole Boston Weatherford]]|journal=Greensboro News &amp; Record|location=Greensboro, N.C.|date=2000-01-16|page=H.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further described the Pokémon as "a dead ringer for an obese [[drag queen]]." She further criticized the Pokémon in the magazine ''[[Advertising Age]]'', comparing it to ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'' and suggesting its English name as also a possible derogatory remark towards blacks relating to [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] (with its original Japanese name, Rougela, being unrelated).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carole Boston Weatherford|title=Pokemon phenom harbors racist image;Jynx character is a stereotype comparable to Little Black Sambo|journal=[[Advertising Age]]|date=2000-02-28|publisher=Crain Communications, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Jim Crow Museum at [[Ferris State University]] has listed Jynx as an example of racism in modern material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/newforms/|title=New Racist Forms: Jim Crow in the 21st Century|publisher=The Jim Crow Museum, [[Ferris State University]]|author=David Pilgrim|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Game Freak modified Jynx's design in localized versions of the games, a change which would several years later be reflected in the Japanese versions of the games and the [[Pokémon (anime)|anime series]].&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/events/a-decade-of-pokemon-scandals/a-decade-of-pokemon-scandals/1299469/5|publisher=[[Yahoo]]|title=A Decade of Pokemon Scandals - Jynx Incites Racial Backlash|accessdate=2009-06-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330005518/http://videogames.yahoo.com/events/a-decade-of-pokemon-scandals/a-decade-of-pokemon-scandals/1299469/5|archivedate=2009-03-30|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, episodes featuring the older Jynx design were censored or completely removed from televised syndication by [[Warner Bros.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack DeVries|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|title=Pokemon Report: You Can't Do That on Television|date=2009-02-02|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/02/pokemon-report-you-cant-do-that-on-television?page=2|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms still persist, such as [[1UP.com]] which, in an article discussing the "lamest Pokémon" of the series, referred to it as the "infamous blackface Pokémon".&lt;ref name=lamest&gt;{{cite web|author=Kat Bailey|website=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]|title=Top 5 Lamest Pokemon|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169539|accessdate=2009-06-09|archivedate=2009-03-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325020940/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169539|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' writer Mary C. Morton described Jynx as having "explicitly, albeit grossly caricatured, womanly features", and challenged the assertion that the games crossed gender barriers with such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Pokemon: The Dark Side|author=Mary C. Morton|date=1999-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their [[podcast]], ''[[Retronauts]]'', they emphasized it further, noting the design as "creepy" and that it maintained the issue of racism still.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908|title=Retronauts Episode 18|website=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]|host=Jerry Parish, James Mielke, Ryan O'Donnell, Richard Li, Shane Bettenhausen.|date=2007-04-05|accessdate=2009-06-10|archivedate=2009-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226035617/http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[IGN]]'' also criticized the design, characterizing Jynx as a "transvestite midget in racially offensive makeup".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/14/pokemon-report-do-not-want|title=Pokemon Report: Do Not Want|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|first=Jack|last=DeVries|date=2008-11-14|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameDaily]] ranked it first on their list of the "Top 10 Weirdest Looking Pokémon", noting its design suggested the presence of breasts, and echoing qualms regarding its resemblance to blackface performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-10-weirdest-looking-pokemon/?page=10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415052735/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-10-weirdest-looking-pokemon/?page=10|archivedate=2009-04-15|title=Top 10 Weirdest Looking Pokémon|publisher=[[AOL]]|work=[[GameDaily]]|accessdate=2009-06-09|author=Chris Buffa|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Games.net]] ranked it fourth on their "Top 10 Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters" list, questioning why the character was clothed in what resembled a "slinky dress and push-up bra".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830084600/http://www.games.net/article/netten/2/116901/top-ten-disturbingly-sexual-game-characters/|url=http://www.games.net/article/netten/2/116901/top-ten-disturbingly-sexual-game-characters/|archivedate=2008-08-30|title=Top Ten Disturbingly Sexual Game Characters|author1=Ben Karl|author2=Dave Rudden|date=2007-10-05|accessdate=2007-10-12|publisher=games.net|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the book ''Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific'' defended Jynx's design, suggesting Sugimori developed it to draw upon the humor of heta-uma (a term meaning bad/nice), and described the design as oscillating between the poles of good and bad, as a result offering diversity within the game and inviting scrutiny from players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific|author1=Larissa Hjorth|author2=David Surman|year=2009|publisher=[[Routledge]]/[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|isbn=0-415-99627-9|edition=1st|chapter=9|pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamesRadar]] described [[List of generation I Pokémon#Magmar|Magmar]] and Jynx as the [[Romeo and Juliet]] of Pokémon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pokemusings-week-32/2/|title=Pokemusings, week 32, page 2|website=[[GamesRadar+]]|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson compared Jynx to the [[Gothita|Gothita line]] due to both's designs being based on an "overtly feminine form", though describing Gothita's line as "way less creepy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carolyn Gudmundson|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pokemon-black-and-white-pokedex-gothita-gothorita-gothitelle/|title=Pokemon Black and White Pokedex - Gothita, Gothorita, Gothitelle|website=GamesRadar+|date=2011-03-01|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Loredana Lipperini described Jynx as an "opera singer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MOQc163-XCcC|title=Generazione Pokémon: I bambini e l'invasione planetaria dei nuovi "giocattoli di ruolo"|isbn=9788882102494|author=Loredana Lipperini|year=2000|publisher=Castelvecchi|pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson listed "Humanoid" as one of the most overused Pokémon designs, listing Jynx and [[Mr. Mime]] as one of "the most infamous" examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-most-overused-pokemon-designs/2/|title=The most overused Pokemon designs, Pokemon HeartGold / SoulSilver DS Features|website=GamesRadar+|author=Carolyn Gudmundson|date=2010-07-24|accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being offered a superpowered item or ability to use in this new world, Kazuma, following some provocation, chooses Aqua herself to accompany him to the town of Axel, quickly finding her absent-mindedness to be less than beneficial.{{ref|LN|LN 1.P}} With Aqua unable to return to the afterlife until the [[Dark Lord (fiction)|Devil King]] is defeated, the two form a [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] and recruit two other members; an explosion-obsessed magician named Megumin and a masochistic crusader named Darkness.{{ref|LN|LN 1.2.4}} Due to the party's dysfunctional abilities, Kazuma quickly gives up on the idea of defeating the Devil King and tries to live a luxurious lifestyle, only to find the circumstances of his daily life are forcing him and his party to encounter and battle the Devil King's generals.{{ref|LN|LN 2.3}}

{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=''KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World'' is an anime that has a lot of fun mocking the tropes of the typical JRPG fantasy world via a colorful cast of characters that are enjoyable in their own right. The comedy is so spot-on with its deadpan nature that it's hard not to be drawn in by that alone.|source=– Richard Eisenbeis, in his review of the anime&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis review" /&gt;}}

Like its light novel counterpart, the anime has received positive reception for its comedy, parody of the "trapped in a fantasy world" subgenre, and faithful adaptation of the light novels.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; Reviewing the first few episodes, [[Anime News Network]] (ANN)'s Theron Martin described the second episode as "the funniest episode of anime I have seen since ''[[Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun]]'' aired", while also praising the series' musical score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world/episodes-1-2/.97800 |title=KonoSuba – God's blessing on this wonderful world!!

In every scene, his inflection and tone is exactly right to milk the maximum value out of a scene's comedy potential. ... The female seiyuu are nailing their roles too, but many scenes in this series wouldn't be half as funny without Kazuma's dry wit as the slightly-less-crazy center of a crazy maelstrom.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, a common criticism of the anime was its inconsistent character animation, one that was described as "low budget" as characters appeared [[off-model]].&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morrissy|first=Kim|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/02/27-1/feature-novel-vs-anime-konosuba|title=FEATURE: Novel vs Anime - "Konosuba"|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=February 27, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koichi Kikuta responded by stating such design was intentional, hoping to "bring out the individuality of each character" rather than the prettier artwork in the light novels; to do this, Kikuta's animation displayed "their more human sides, like their unflattering traits and their distressed moments."&lt;ref name="Interview with Koichi Kikuta"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wavemotioncannon.com/2017/02/07/konosuba-interview-with-koichi-kikuta-anime-style-009-july-2016/|title=Konosuba Interview with Koichi Kikuta (Anime Style 009, July 2016)|work=Wave Motion Cannon|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crunchyroll]]'s Kim Morrissy considered the animation to be humorous, especially fitting in a comedic anime.&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; [[Kotaku]] writer Richard Eisenbeis explained much of the series' humor derives from the deconstruction of Kazuma's hopes of becoming the hero of a fantasy world, instead realizing he is forced to struggle his way through the world.&lt;ref name="Eisenbeis review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisenbeis|first=Richard|url=https://kotaku.com/when-your-new-life-in-a-jrpg-world-doesn-t-live-up-to-e-1778353269|title=When Your New Life in a JRPG World Doesn't Live Up to Expectations|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=May 26, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing Kazuma's problems in a fantasy world to those in real life, Creamer wrote about a sense of relatability between the series' protagonists and the audience, as the party deals with issues like debt and taking questionable jobs because of high pay. On a critical note, Creamer disapproved of Kazuma's negative attitude, which he felt harmed the comedy in the series.&lt;ref name="Creamer review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Creamer|first=Nick|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/konosuba-god-blessing-on-this-wonderful-world-episodes-1-10-streaming/.100209|title=KonoSuba – God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!

''KonoSuba''{{'s}} characters, especially those in Kazuma's party, have gained favorable thoughts in the anime community. Creamer described the group as possessing a "strange but endearing chemistry," as the members are unfriendly with one another, yet are close.&lt;ref name="Creamer review" /&gt; Morrissy added the party's "emotional bond is also evident in the ways they interact with each other. My favorite thing about the anime is that it takes the time to draw these nuances out onscreen and express them with visual flair."&lt;ref name="Novel vs Anime" /&gt; Megumin in particular has been considered one of the series' most popular characters, winning Sneaker Bunko's official Favorite ''KonoSuba'' Character poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sneakerbunko.jp/special/konosuba-charavote/index.php|title=KonoSuba Character Poll|work=[[Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko]]|accessdate=September 1, 2017|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also the sixth-highest vote in ''[[Newtype]]''{{'s}} 2015–16 Awards for Best Female Character (Kazuma was third in the male category) and received the most "Other" votes in the Best Girl category in [[Crunchyroll]]'s Anime Awards 2016.&lt;ref name="Newtype 2015-16 Awards"&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Scott|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2016/10/09/japanese-fans-pick-favorite-anime-from-last-twelve-months-in-newtype-awards|title=Japanese Fans Pick Favorite Anime From Last Twelve Months In Newtype Awards|publisher=[[Crunchyroll]]|date=October 9, 2016|accessdate=September 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crunchyroll Awards 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2017/01/10-1/feature-crunchyroll-anime-awards-the-results-are-in-see-who-won|title=FEATURE: Crunchyroll Anime Awards - The Results are In!

In 2016, the anime was voted the tenth-best TV anime in the ''Newtype'' 2015–16 Awards.&lt;ref name="Newtype 2015-16 Awards" /&gt; ''KonoSuba'' also finished runner-up for Best Comedy in the Anime Awards 2016 to ''[[Haven't You Heard? I'm Sakamoto]]''.&lt;ref name="Crunchyroll Awards 2016" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Kremvax''' was originally a fictitious [[Usenet]] site at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], named like the then large number of Usenet [[VAX]]en with names of the form [[foo]]vax. Kremvax was announced on April 1, 1984 in a posting ostensibly originated there by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. The posting was actually forged by [[Piet Beertema]] of [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]] (in Amsterdam) as an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool]]'s joke.&lt;ref name="beert1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.godfatherof.nl/kremvax.html|title=The kremvax hoax|last=Beertema|first=Piet|publisher=godfatherof.nl|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fictitious sites mentioned in the [[hoax]] were moskvax and kgbvax.  The actual origin of the email was mcvax, one of the first European sites on the internet.&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/magazine/16-04/st_best|title=10 Best: April Fools' Gags (the Web Is Closing for Spring Cleaning!)|last=Novak|first=Asami|date=24 March 2008|publisher=Wired|accessdate=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later Usenet was joined by [[DEMOS_(ISP)|demos.su]], the first genuine site based in [[Moscow]]. Some readers needed convincing that the postings from it were not just another prank. [[Vadim Antonov]], the senior programmer at Demos and the major poster from there until mid-1991, was quite aware of all this, and referred to it frequently in his own postings. Antonov later arranged to have the domain's gateway site named kremvax.demos.su, turning fiction into truth and, according to one account, "demonstrating that the hackish sense of humor transcends cultural barriers".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric S. Raymond|Raymond, E. S.]]: "The [[Jargon File]]", [http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/K/kremvax.html Kremvax entry], 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Limelight''''' is a 2011 documentary that charts the rise and fall of [[New York City]] club king [[Peter Gatien]]. Produced by Gatien's daughter, Jen Gatien, it was released in special markets throughout the United States and Canada on September 23, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chew Bose|first=Durga|title=Jen Gatien Dives Into the Limelight (Again)|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/blogs/film/2011-03-14/jen-gatien-limelight/|publisher=''Interview Magazine''|accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
As the owner of legendary New York City hotspots like [[The Limelight]], [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|Tunnel]], [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]], and Club USA, Peter Gatien was considered by many to be the undisputed king of the 1980s New York City club scene. The [[Ontario]] native, whose trademark eye patch made him stand out in a crowd, built and oversaw a chain of nightclub ventures that brought thousands of patrons per night during its peak years. However, after years of legal battles and police pressure spearheaded by Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s drive to crack down on the city's nightlife scene during the mid-1990s, Gatien was deported to [[Canada]], bringing an end to his presence and influence in the city's nightlife scene. The documentary features interviews with numerous people involved in the club's scene, as well as key informants in Gatien's high-profile trial. Produced by Gatien's daughter, Jen, and Alfred Spellman, and directed by [[Billy Corben]] (who previously directed the film ''[[Cocaine Cowboys]]''), the film documents the rise and fall of Gatien and his nightclub empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.rakontur.com/limelight/|title=Limelight|publisher=Rakontur|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hungary]] has submitted films for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] every year since 1965. Only [[List of French submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|France]] has a longer unbroken streak entering the Foreign Oscar competition.

The Best Foreign Language Film Award is handed out annually by the United States [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] to a [[feature length|feature-length]] motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary's submission is selected annually by a Selection Committee of esteemed film professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://cineuropa.org/newsdetail.aspx?documentID=109135&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungarian films have been nominated for [[Oscar award]]s ten times, and István Szabó's ''Mephisto'' won an Oscar. Hungarian films were nominated six times in eleven years, between 1978 and 1988. The next win came in 2015 with ''[[Son of Saul]]''.&lt;ref name="SaulWin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2016-oscars-best-foreign-language-869714 |title=Oscars: Hungary Wins Its First Foreign-Language Honor Since Fall of Communism |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=29 February 2016 |accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

István Szabó has had his films selected to represent Hungary seven times between 1967 and 1992, more than any other Hungarian director. Four of his films were nominated for an Oscar, including one win. [[Zoltán Fábri]]'s films were selected four times between 1965 and 1978, and nominated twice.

==Submissions==
Every year, each country is invited by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to submit its best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The Foreign  Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via [[secret ballot]] to determine the five nominees for the award.&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt; Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Hungary for review by the Academy for the award.

Almost all films were primarily in [[Magyar language|Magyar]] (also known as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), although three of Istvan Szabo's films- ''Colonel Redl'', ''Hanussen'' and ''Mephisto''- all of which starred Austrian actor [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]], were largely in [[German language|German]].

{{Husayn}}
'''Maddahi''' is a ceremonial [[singing]] specialized for [[Shia]] Muslims. People who croon this style are called [[Maddah]]. [[Maddah]]s mostly sing in [[Ahl al-Bayt]]'s birth and death anniversary. The theme of maddahi may be joyous or sorrowful. Most of maddahs are men but few women perform it in exclusively female gatherings. The majority of Maddahis are sung in [[mourning]] of Ahl al-Bayt particularly 
''[[Mourning of Muharram]]'' in beginning of [[Muharram]] until [[Day of Ashura]] and [[Arba'een]].

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist film theory''' is one of the oldest forms of [[film theory]].  

==Overview==
[[Sergei Eisenstein]] and many other [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[filmmaker]]s in the 1920s expressed ideas of [[Marxism]] through film.  In fact, the [[Hegelian dialectic]] was considered best displayed in [[film editing]] through the [[Kuleshov Experiment]] and the development of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]].

While this [[structuralism|structuralist]] approach to Marxism and filmmaking was used, the more vociferous complaint that the Russian filmmakers had was with the [[Literary technique|narrative]] structure of the [[cinema of the United States]].

Eisenstein's solution was to shun narrative structure by eliminating the individual [[protagonist]] and tell stories where the action is moved by the group and the story is told through a clash of one image against the next (whether in composition, motion, or idea) so that the audience is never lulled into believing that they are watching something that has not been worked over.

Eisenstein himself, however, was accused by the Soviet authorities under [[Joseph Stalin]] of "formalist error," of highlighting form as a thing of beauty instead of portraying the worker nobly.

French Marxist film makers, such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]], would employ radical editing and choice of subject matter, as well as subversive [[parody]], to heighten class consciousness and promote Marxist ideas.

Situationist film maker [[Guy Debord]], author of ''[[Society of the Spectacle|The Society of the Spectacle]]'', began his film ''In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni'' [Wandering around in the night we are consumed by fire] with a radical critique of the spectator who goes to the cinema to forget about his dispossessed daily life.

Situationist film makers produced a number of important films, where the only contribution by the situationist film cooperative was the sound-track.  In ''[[Can dialectics break bricks?]]'' (1973) a [[Media of the People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[Kung Fu]] film was transformed by redubbing into an epistle on [[state capitalism]] and [[Proletarian]] [[revolution]].  The intellectual technique of using capitalism's own structures against itself is known as [[détournement]]. 

Marxist film theory has developed from these precise and historical beginnings and is now sometimes viewed in a wider way to refer to any power relationships or structures within a moving image text.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
An {{Nihongo|'''''okiya'''''|置屋}} is the lodging house in which a ''[[Maiko (geiko)|maiko]]'' or ''[[geisha]]'' lives during the length of her nenki (contract or career as a geisha).

A young woman's first step toward becoming a [[geisha]] is to be accepted into an okiya (''boarding house''), a geisha house owned by the woman who will pay for her training. The [[proprietor|proprietress]] of the okiya is called ''okā-san'' (the Japanese word for "mother"). The okiya normally pays all expenses, including for [[kimono]] and training. The okiya plays a large part in the life of a [[geiko]] or maiko, as the women in the okiya become her geisha family, and the okā-san manages her career in the ''karyūkai'' (flower and willow world). 

''Geiko'' (Kyoto dialect for geisha) live in an ''okiya'' and work in a teahouse ([[Ochaya#Japan|ochaya]]), where there are [[music]], [[dancing]], [[partying]], sometimes food, and plenty of [[alcohol]]. A geisha pays a [[percentage]] of her [[earnings]] to maintain the house and support all the people living there who are not working geisha, including ''maiko'' (apprentice geisha), retired geisha and house [[maid]]s. [[Kyoto]] is one of the places where the strict geisha [[training]] continues still and the geiko traditions are handed down. 

There may be more than one geisha or maiko living in an okiya at any given point. Inversely, there are houses licensed as okiya but without any [[geisha]]. Generally, a geisha who has fulfilled her [[financial]] [[obligations]] to the house may choose to live independently but will remain affiliated with the okiya for the remainder of her [[career]]. Inside the small confines of the geiko communities, it is women who wield [[Power (philosophy)|power]]: everyone hopes for girl children, so that they can carry on the line of geisha. If a woman has a boy, she must move out or give him up, as it is forbidden for men to live in an okiya. For all of their focus on men when they are at work, geiko and maiko live in a [[matriarchal society]]. Women run the okiya, women teach girls the [[skills]] they need to become a full-fledged geisha, and women introduce new maiko into the [[teahouses]] that will be their livelihood. Women run the teahouses, too, and they can make or break a geisha's career. If a geisha offends the mistress of the main teahouse where she does business, she may lose her [[livelihood]] entirely. 

The okā-san of the okiya may [[adopt]] one of the geisha as her daughter (''musume'') and [[Beneficiary|heiress]] (''atotori''). Henceforth that girl will live in the okiya permanently and all the money she earns will go to that establishment and other people who help to take care of the geisha's outfits, hairstyles and accessories. Under such an [[arrangement]], the geisha's debts are absorbed by the okiya.

'''Poetic justice''' is  a [[Literary technique|literary device]] in which ultimately [[virtue]] is [[Bounty (reward)|rewarded]] and viciousness is [[punishment|punished]].  In modern literature{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} it is often accompanied by an [[irony|ironic]] twist of fate related to the character's own action.&lt;ref name="Gertz2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manuela Gertz|title=Poetic Justice in William Faulkner's Absalom Absalom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PYzH_7iit8C&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=July 2010|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-66116-9|page=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
English drama critic [[Thomas Rymer]] coined the phrase in ''The Tragedies of the Last Age Considere'd'' (1678) to describe how a work should inspire proper [[morality|moral]] behaviour in its audience by illustrating the triumph of good over evil. The demand for poetic justice is consistent in Classical authorities and shows up in [[Horace]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Quintillian]], so Rymer's phrasing is a reflection of a commonplace. [[Philip Sidney]], in ''Defense of Poetry,'' argued that poetic justice was, in fact, the reason that fiction should be allowed in a civilized nation.

== History of the notion ==
Notably, poetic justice does not merely require that vice be punished and virtue rewarded, but also that logic triumph. If, for example, a character is dominated by greed for most of a romance or drama; he cannot become generous. The action of a play, poem, or fiction must obey the rules of logic as well as morality. During the late 17th century, critics pursuing a [[Neo-Classicism|neo-classical]] standard would criticize [[William Shakespeare]] in favor of [[Ben Jonson]] precisely on the grounds that Shakespeare's characters change during the course of the play. (See [[Shakespeare's reputation]] for more on the Shakespeare/Jonson dichotomy.) When [[Restoration comedy]], in particular, flouted poetic justice by rewarding libertines and punishing dull-witted moralists, there was a backlash in favor of drama, in particular, of more strict moral correspondence.

==Sex Trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Brunei}}
Brunei is a destination and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Some migrants who transit Brunei become victims of sex trafficking upon arrival in Malaysia or Indonesia. Some Bruneian women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking domestically. Retention of migrant workers’ travel documents by employers or agencies remains a widespread practice, although the law prohibits it.&lt;ref name="state 17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brunei 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271153.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=21 January 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 there were prosecutions against three Thai nationals for sex trafficking. Courts sentenced all three individuals to four years in prison and fines of USD $22,250, USD $14,836, and USD $7,418, respectively, but all three accepted added time to their prison sentences ranging from 10 to 30 months in lieu of paying the fines.&lt;ref name="state 17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Thais jailed, face caning for forcing a 17-year-old girl into prostitution in Brunei  - The Nation|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30283527|website=The Nation|accessdate=21 January 2018|language=en|date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Brunei as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state 17" /&gt;

[[File:Ratna Asmara p298.JPG|thumb|Promotional portrait of Ratna, circa 1940]]
'''Ratna Asmara''' ({{circa}} 1914&amp;nbsp;– before 1981) was an [[Indonesia]]n actress and film director. Originally active in theatre, in 1940 she starred in the [[romance film]] ''[[Kartinah]]'', which her first husband [[Andjar Asmara|Andjar]] directed.

After appearing in several further films, she made her directorial debut in 1950 with ''[[Sedap Malam]]'' (''Sweetness of the Night''), which made her the first female film director in Indonesian history. Although her work was generally ignored, later female Indonesian directors have found critical acclaim.

== Early career ==
Ratna was born in the [[Minangkabau Highlands]] of [[Sumatra]] {{circa}} 1914. This ethnic [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] actress had a sister, Suhara, who was married to the director [[Bachtiar Effendi]].{{sfn|Dunia Film 1954, Ratna Asmara}}

Ratna and her husband Andjar joined the [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]] touring troupe in the early 1930s;{{sfn|JCG, Opera Bangsawan}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=25}} with the troupe she was known for the quality of her voice.{{sfn|T.W.H.|1992|p=152}} In the late 1930s she joined Andjar with his Bollero troupe and became its star.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=25}} She also acted for the Royal Balinese Dancers.{{sfn|Dunia Film 1954, Ratna Asmara}}

When Andjar was asked by [[The Teng Chun]] to direct a film for The's company Java Industrial Film (JIF), Ratna came with him.{{sfn|Said|1982|pp=136–137}} The couple earned 1,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]] each for their role in the resulting film, ''[[Kartinah]]'' (1940), Andjar as director and Ratna as its star. The film, a love story between the nurse Kartinah (played by Ratna) and her commander, was also the first war film in the country, taking place within the Air Raid Preparation teams ({{lang|nl|Luch Bischermen Diens}}).{{sfn|Prawirawinta|195?|p=74}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=213}}

Ratna also appeared in Andjar's later directorial work, ''[[Noesa Penida]]'' (a love story set in [[Bali]]) and in ''[[Ratna Moetoe Manikam]]'', a story about a love triangle between two goddesses and a mortal man.{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=104}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ratna Moetoe Manikam}} During the [[Indonesian National Revolution|National Revolution]] following [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia's independence]], Ratna appeared in one further film: Andjar's 1948 ''[[Djaoeh Dimata]]'' (''Out of Sight'').{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=360}}

== Directing ==
In 1950, Ratna was commissioned by [[Djamaluddin Malik]] to direct the film ''[[Sedap Malam]]'' (''Sweetness of the Night'') for Malik's company Persari; Malik produced. Andjar wrote the screenplay. This made her the first female film director in the country.{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=104}} This was followed by two further films for the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Djakarta Film, both of which Andjar wrote: ''Musim Bunga di Selabintana'' (''Spring in Selabintana'') in 1951 and ''Dr Samsi'' in 1952.{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=104}}

In 1953, Ratna established Ratna Films, which had a single production, ''Nelajan'' (''The Fishermen''), before being rebranded Asmara Films. This new company produced ''Dewi dan Pemilihan Umum'' (''Dewi and the Election'') in 1954, with Ratna as director; this coincided with the [[Indonesian legislative election, 1955|first legislative elections]] in 1955.{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=104}}

Ratna left Indonesia for Italy to study film in 1954.{{sfn|Dunia Film 1954, Ratna Asmara}} She had died by 1981.{{sfn|Yodaz 1981, Saya Tidak Tahu}}

== Legacy ==
After Ratna, only three female directors appeared in Indonesian cinema until near the end of the 20th century: Citra Dewi, [[Sofia W.D.]], and Ida Farida.{{sfn|Lent|1999|p=105}} These directors rarely, if ever, received the same recognition as their male counterparts; acting remained the only way for a woman in the industry to gain recognition.{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=103}} Indeed, during her directorial career Ratna received little support from male directors.{{sfn|Chotimah 2011, Perempuan di Dalam}}

After the [[fall of Suharto]] in 1998, the number of women directors has increased dramatically,{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=103}} with several of them receiving national and international recognition. The earliest in this generation are [[Mira Lesmana]] and [[Nan Achnas]], who collaborated with several other directors in ''Kuldesak'' (1999).{{sfn|Chotimah 2011, Perempuan di Dalam}} Further examples include [[Nia Dinata]], who has had two of her films, ''[[Ca-bau-kan]]'' (2002) and ''[[Berbagi Suami]]'' (2006) submitted for an [[List of Indonesian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]];{{sfn|GSCFFI, Nia Dinata – GSCFFI}} [[Ucu Agustin]] has been described as "one of Indonesia’s top documentary filmmakers" and had her films screened internationally;{{sfn|Krismantari 2010, Tackling the tough questions}} while [[Djenar Maesa Ayu]]'s ''[[Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!]]'' (2008) was on several lists of the best films of the year.{{sfn|Tempo 2008, Di Layar Lebar}}{{sfn|Liem 2008, Top ten theatrical releases}}

'''Le Salon Indien du Grand Café''' was a room in the basement of the Grand Café, on the Boulevard des Capucines near the [[Place de l'Opéra]] in the center of [[Paris]]. It is notable for being the place that hosted the very first public [[movie]][[Movie projector|screening]], on December 28, 1895, consisting in ten short clips presented by the [[Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]]. These short films clips (in order of presentation), were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html Bienvenue sur Adobe GoLive 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912104656/http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html |date=2005-09-12 }}.

Scan lines are important in representations of image data, because many [[image file format]]s have special rules for data at the end of a scan line. For example, there may be a rule that each scan line starts on a particular boundary (such as a byte or word; see for example [[BMP file format]]). This means that even otherwise compatible raster data may need to be analyzed at the level of scan lines in order to convert between formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11877">'''Solving chess''' means finding an optimal strategy for playing [[chess]], i.e. one by which one of the players (White or Black) can always force a victory, or both can force a draw (see [[Solved game]]). It also means more generally solving ''chess-like'' games (i.e. [[Game theory#Combinatorial games|combinatorial games]] of [[perfect information]]), such as [[infinite chess]]. According to [[Zermelo's theorem (game theory)|Zermelo's theorem]], a hypothetically determinable optimal strategy does exist for chess and chess-like games.

In a weaker sense, ''solving chess'' may refer to proving which one of the three possible outcomes (White wins; Black wins; draw) is the result of two perfect players, without necessarily revealing the optimal strategy itself (see [[indirect proof]]).&lt;ref&gt;

No complete solution for chess in either of the two senses [[Solved game#Partially solved games|is known]], nor is it expected that chess will be solved in the near future. There is disagreement on whether the current [[Moore's law|exponential growth]] of computing power will continue long enough to someday allow for solving it by "[[Brute-force search|brute force]]", i.e. by checking all possibilities.

| A '''mate-in-546''' position found in the Lomonosov 7-piece tablebase. White to move. (In this example an 8th piece is added with a trivial first-move capture.)
}}

[[Endgame tablebase]]s have solved chess to a limited degree, determining perfect play in a number of [[Chess endgame|endgame]]s, including all non-trivial endgames with no more than seven pieces or pawns (including the two kings).&lt;ref name="Lomonosov Tablebases"&gt;
{{cite web
|title=Lomonosov Tablebases
|url=http://chessok.com/?page_id=27966
|accessdate=2013-04-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of developing the 7-piece endgame tablebase, is that many interesting theoretical chess endings have been found. One example is a "mate-in-546" position, which with perfect play is a forced checkmate in 546 moves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/forum/view/endgames/who-wins-from-this-puzzle "Who wins from this puzzle?"] A mate-in-546 chess position, with discussion (Post 1: Position, Post 7: Playable).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a position is beyond the ability of any human to solve, and indeed no chess engine plays it correctly (unless the engine itself is designed to have access to the tablebase).

Finding positions such as this can make one speculate what other interesting chess situations will be found, as more chess positions are solved. 

==Predictions on when/if chess will be solved==
[[Information theory|Information theorist]] [[Claude Shannon]] argued in 1951 that it is not feasible for any computer to actually solve chess, since it would either need to compare some 10{{sup|120}} possible game variations, or have a "dictionary" denoting an optimal move for each of the about 10{{sup|43}} possible board positions.&lt;ref name="CSpaper"&gt;

}}{{quote|"With chess it is possible, in principle, to play a perfect game or construct a machine to do so as follows: One considers in a given position all possible moves, then all moves for the opponent, etc., to the end of the game (in each variation). The end must occur, by the rules of the games after a finite number of moves (remembering the [[fifty-move rule|50 move drawing rule]]). Each of these variations ends in win, loss or draw. By working backward from the end one can determine whether there is a forced win, the position is a draw or is lost. It is easy to show, however, even with the high computing speed available in electronic calculators this computation is impractical. In typical chess positions there will be of the order of 30 legal moves. The number holds fairly constant until the game is nearly finished as shown ... by De Groot, who averaged the number of legal moves in a large number of master games. Thus a move for White and then one for Black gives about 10{{sup|3}} possibilities. A typical game lasts about 40 moves to resignation of one party. This is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate out to checkmate, not resignation. However, even at this figure there will be 10{{sup|120}} variations to be calculated from the initial position. A machine operating at the rate of one variation per micro-second would require over 10{{sup|90}} years to calculate the first move!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus theoretically possible to [[Solved game|solve]] chess, but the time frame required (according to Shannon, 10{{sup|90}} years) puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology.

The number of mathematical operations required to solve chess, however, may be significantly different than the number of operations required to produce the entire [[Game tree|game-tree]] of chess. In particular, if White has a forced win, only a subset of the game-tree would require evaluation to confirm that a forced-win exists (i.e. with no refutations from Black). Furthermore, Shannon's calculation for the complexity of chess assumes an average game length of 40 moves, but there is no mathematical basis to say that a forced win by either side would have any relation to this game length. Indeed, some expertly played games (grandmaster-level play) have been as short as 16 moves. For these reasons, mathematicians and game theorists have been reluctant to categorically state that solving chess is an intractable problem.&lt;ref name="CSpaper"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1736556 http://www.chessgames.com] Magnus Carlsen vs Viswanathlan Anand, King's Indian Attack: Double Fianchetto (A07), 1/2-1/2, 16 moves.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans-Joachim Bremermann]], a professor of [[mathematics]] and [[biophysics]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], further argued in a 1965 paper that the "speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by specific physical barriers: the ''[[Speed of light|light barrier]]'', the ''quantum barrier'', and the ''thermodynamical barrier''. These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, will ever be able to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess." Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, "In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game, it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ... A theoretical understanding of such heuristic programming, however, is still very much wanting."&lt;ref&gt;

Recent scientific advances have not significantly changed these assessments. The game of [[English draughts|checkers]] was (weakly) solved in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Schaeffer]], the scientist who led the effort, said a breakthrough such as [[quantum computing]] would be needed before solving chess could even be attempted, but he does not rule out the possibility, saying that the one thing he learned from his 16-year effort of solving checkers "is to never underestimate the advances in technology".&lt;ref&gt;

==Chess variants==

Some [[Chess Variant|chess variants]] which are simpler than chess have been solved. A winning strategy for black in [[Maharajah and the Sepoys]] can be easily memorised. The 5×5 [[Minichess#5×5 chess|Gardner's Minichess]] variant has been [[Solved game|weakly solved]] as a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Mhalla|first=Mehdi|last2=Prost|first2=Frederic|date=2013-07-26|title=Gardner's Minichess Variant is solved|eprint=1307.7118|class=cs.GT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Losing Chess|Losing chess]] is played on an 8x8 board, its forced capture rule greatly limits its complexity and a computational analysis managed to weakly solve this variant as a win for white.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/~watkins/LOSING_CHESS/LCsolved.pdf|title=Losing Chess: 1. e3 wins for White|last=Watkins|first=Mark|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of solving individual, specific, chess-like games becomes more difficult as the board-size is increased, such as in large chess variants, and [[infinite chess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Aviezri Fraenkel |author2=D.

'''Sonora Webster Carver''' (February 2, 1904 {{spaced ndash}} September 20, 2003), born in [[Waycross, Georgia]], was an American entertainer, most notable as one of the first female [[Diving horse|horse divers]].&lt;ref name="ssdi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi
|publisher=Ancestry.com |title=Social Security Death Index |quote=Original data: Social Security Administration. Social Security Death Index, Master File}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Webster answered an ad placed by [[William Frank Carver|William "Doc" Carver]] in 1923 &lt;ref name="horse"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kent |first=Bill |title=The Horse Was in Charge |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEEDB1E31F937A35756C0A961958260 |publisher=New York Times |date=1997-05-04 |accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a diving girl and soon earned a place in circus history. 
Her job was to mount a running horse as it reached the top of a forty-foot (sometimes sixty-foot) tower and sail down on its back as it plunged into an 11-foot pool of water directly below. She was a sensation and soon became the lead diving girl for Doc's act as they traveled the country and the first diving girl quit.

Sonora fell in love with and eventually married Doc's son, Albert (Al) Floyd Carver, in October 1928. Al had taken over the show in 1927, after the death of Dr. Carver.&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt; Sonora's sister Arnette Webster French followed in her footsteps, becoming a horse diver and joining the show in 1928.&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt;

In 1931, Sonora was blinded by [[retinal detachment]], due to hitting the water off balance with her eyes open, while diving her horse, Red Lips, on [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]'s [[Steel Pier]],&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt; the act's permanent home since 1929.&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt; After her accident she continued to dive horses until 1942. Arnette left the show in 1935.&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt;

Arnette explained Sonora’s decision to continue riding after her accident in this way: "[[Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken|The movie]] made a big deal about having the courage to go on riding after she lost her sight. But, the truth was riding the horse was the most fun you could have and we just loved it so. We didn't want to give it up. Once you were on the horse, there really wasn't much to do but hold on. The horse was in charge."&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt;

Arnette, who was 15 when she took her first horse dive, remarked in an interview that "Wherever we went, the S.P.C.A. ([[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]) was always snooping around, trying to find if we were doing anything that was cruel to animals. They never found anything because those horses lived [[The Life of Riley|the life of Riley]]. In all the years of the act, there was never a horse that was injured."&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt;

Sonora's account can be read in her 1961 book, ''[[A Girl and Five Brave Horses]]'', and seen in the fictionalized movie version of her life, ''[[Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken]]'', starring [[Gabrielle Anwar]]. She was disappointed in the way that the movie depicted her life and career. She remarked to Arnette after screening the film that "the only thing true in it was that I rode diving horses, I went blind, and I continued to ride for another 11 years."&lt;ref name="horse"/&gt;

Sonora died at the age of 99 on September 21, 2003.&lt;ref name="ssdi"/&gt; She lived in [[Pleasantville, New Jersey]] at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sims |first=Gayle Ronan |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FDCCD7DC6297C4B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Horse-diver Sonora Webster Carver, 99 |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2003-09-24 |accessdate=2007-12-03 |quote=&lt;br&gt;Sonora Webster Carver, 99, the first woman to dive off Atlantic City's Steel Pier while riding a horse - a stunt she continued for 11 years after she was blinded during a performance - died Sunday Sept 20, 2003 at Our Lady's Residence in Pleasantville, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Street Fighter Alpha 3''''' {{efn|Released in Japan and Asia as {{nihongo|'''''Street Fighter ZERO 3'''''|ストリートファイターZERO３||lead=yes}}.}} is a 2D competitive [[fighting game]] originally released by [[Capcom]] for the arcades in {{vgy|1998}}. It is the third game in the ''[[Street Fighter#Street Fighter Alpha series (1995–98)|Street Fighter Alpha]]'' sub-series, which serves as a prequel to ''[[Street Fighter II]]'', and ran on the same [[CP System II]] hardware as previous ''Alpha'' games. The game was produced after the ''[[Street Fighter III]]'' sub-series has started, being released after ''[[Street Fighter III: 2nd Impact|2nd Impact]]'', but before ''[[Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike|3rd Strike]]''. ''Alpha 3'' further expanded the playable fighter roster from ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]'' and added new features such as selectable fighting styles called "isms".

''Alpha 3'' has also been released on a variety of home platforms starting with the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] port in 1998, which added an exclusive World Tour mode and brought back even more characters, with further versions on the [[Sega Saturn]], [[Dreamcast]], [[Game Boy Advance]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game was also included in the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha Anthology]]'', as well as the ''[[Street Fighter 30 Anniversary Collection]]''.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Street Fighter Alpha 3 - Gameplay.png|frame|left|upright=1.2|Akuma delivers a hurricane kick to [[Rainbow Mika]], on her stage Sardine Beach. Both fighters are using the A-Ism style.]]

''Street Fighter Alpha 3'' discards the "Manual" and "Auto" modes from the previous ''Alpha'' games and instead offers three different playing styles known as "isms" for players to choose from. The standard playing style, A-ism (or Z-ism in Japan), is based on the previous ''Alpha'' games, in which the player has a three-level [[super move|Super Combo]] gauge with access to several Super Combo moves. X-ism is a simple style based on ''Super Street Fighter II Turbo'', in which the player has a single-level Super Combo gauge and access to a single but powerful Super Combo move. The third style, V-ism (or "variable" style), is a unique style that allows the player to perform custom combos similar to the ones in ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'', but cannot use Super Combos. In X-ism, players cannot air-block nor perform Alpha Counters, and can only use 1 Super Combo move in its powerful Level 3 version. X-ism has the highest attack power but least defence, A-ism has more attack power than V-ism and a similar level of defence. All three modes have variations of movesets for each character, adding considerable depth to the gameplay. If 3 modes weren't enough there are hidden modes too that add handicaps to the player as well as benefits (E.g. Classic Mode while you cannot use super combos you cannot be knocked in the air and juggled).

''Alpha 3'' also introduces a "Guard Power Gauge" which depletes each time the player blocks – if the gauge is completely depleted, then the player will remain vulnerable to an attack. When broken the bar shrinks and is refilled to its new maximum, it can be shrunk a number of times. Worth noting, while in X-Ism the character has the least defence of all modes it also has the largest guard bar, vice versa for V-ism with A-Zism being in the middle. Also the guard bar varies between characters, Zangief e.g. has a very large guard bar. The guard bar does not exist in Dramatic Battle matches so no guard crushing is possible there.

The I-ism style is customizable when selecting which character and super gauge to be used, which is only exclusive to Dreamcast version's Saikyo Dojo Mode, or PSP version's MAX update on World Tour or/and Entry Modes.

The controls for several actions have been modified from the previous ''Alpha'' games. For example, the level of a Super Combo move in A-ism is now determined by the strength of the attack button pressed (i.e. Medium Punch or Kick for a Lv. 2 Super Combo), rather than the number of buttons pushed; and throwing is now done by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously. {{clear left}}

==Characters==
The game brings back all eighteen of the characters that appeared in ''Street Fighter Alpha 2''. As with the previous ''Alpha'' titles, several characters were added to the game: [[Cammy]], who was previously featured in the console-exclusive ''Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold'', [[E. Honda]], [[Blanka]], [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]], and [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]]. New characters introduced in ''Alpha 3'' include [[R. Mika]], a Japanese female wrestler who idolizes [[Zangief]]; Karin, [[Sakura Kasugano|Sakura]]'s rival who was first introduced in the ''Street Fighter'' [[manga]] ''Sakura Ganbaru!'' by [[Masahiko Nakahira]]; [[Cody (Final Fight)|Cody]] from ''[[Final Fight]]'', who has since become an escaped convict; and [[Juli and Juni]], two of Shadaloo's "Dolls" who serve as Bison's assassins and guards.

The PlayStation version added the remaining characters introduced in ''[[Super Street Fighter II]]'': [[Dee Jay]], [[Fei Long]], and [[T. Hawk]], along with [[Guile (Street Fighter)|Guile]] from ''Street Fighter II'', Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma from ''Street Fighter Alpha 2'', the latter three being unlockable. The Sega Saturn and Dreamcast versions move Guile and Evil Ryu to the default.

The [[Game Boy Advance]] port contains all of the characters from previous versions, as well as three additional characters: [[Yun and Yang|Yun]] from ''[[Street Fighter III]]'', [[Maki Genryusai|Maki]] from ''[[Final Fight 2]]'', and [[Eagle (Street Fighter)|Eagle]] from the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'', all three based on their incarnations from ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001]]''. The [[PlayStation Portable]] version, ''Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX'', also adds [[Ingrid (Capcom)|Ingrid]] from ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'', to bring the total character count to 38 characters.

==Versions==
* ''Street Fighter Alpha 3'' was initially ported in {{vgy|1998}} to the PlayStation, selling a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roper|first=Chris|title=Capcom Releases Lifetime Sales Numbers|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/05/23/capcom-releases-lifetime-sales-numbers|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version replaced the "hit" sprites with "hit" polygons in order to focus more memory on character animations. Juli, Juni, and Balrog were added to the immediate regular roster, and they were given new character portraits and their own storylines. Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk (the remaining "New Challengers" from ''Super Street Fighter II'') were also included to the roster. Evil Ryu, Guile, and Shin Akuma were also added as secret unlockable characters in the World Tour mode, a mode that allows the player to strengthen and customize their chosen character{{'}}s fighting style while traveling around the world. An additional feature in the Japanese version also made use of the [[PocketStation]] peripheral, which allows the player to build up their character's strength. In this version, Shin Akuma serves as the final boss for Evil Ryu, as well as a secret boss in Final Battle. Due to RAM limitations, the only unique pairings available for a complete campaign in the Dramatic Battle mode are Ryu &amp; Ken and Juli &amp; Juni; other character combinations can only be used for one-match battles. The AI for dramatic battle/survival modes is exceptionally poor with the CPU neglecting to defend against sweep attacks, perhaps due to RAM again. As often with home ports of arcade games, combos often infinite ones are possible due to less frames that aren't possible in the arcade. (Particularly with V-Ism mode and in Dramatic Battle/Survival stages)
*This version was re-released for download on the North American [[PlayStation Network]] on October 18, 2011.

* The {{vgy|1999}} [[Dreamcast]] version, titled ''Street Fighter Alpha 3: Saikyo Dojo'' (or ''Street Fighter Zero 3: Saikyō-ryū Dōjō'' in Japan), uses all the added features from the PlayStation version of the game, but features a different World Tour mode. An online mode was added, allowing players to display their high scores. In addition, a Saikyo Dojo mode was added which pits a very weak character of the player's choice against two very strong opponents. The Dreamcast version was re-released in Japan in {{vgy|2000}} as ''Street Fighter Zero 3: Saikyō-ryū Dōjō for Matching Service'' as a mail order title via Dreamcast Direct. The ''Matching Service'' version differs from the original with the addition of an Online Versus mode.

* The [[Sega Saturn]] version of ''Street Fighter Zero 3'' was also released in 1999 shortly after the initial Dreamcast version in Japan only. This port makes use of Sega's 4-MB RAM cartridge and uses all the features from the PlayStation version except for the polygon usage and PocketStation mode. The Saturn version uses the extra RAM to include more frames, sprites but slower loading times than the PlayStation version, making it near arcade perfect. Evil Ryu and Guile are immediately selectable, while the player can also unlock Shin Akuma, who shares a slot with his regular counterpart. While the World Tour and [[Survival mode]]s are virtually unchanged from the PlayStation version, Dramatic Battle mode received improvements with the addition of Reverse Dramatic Battle mode and allowing three different characters to be used. This is also the only port to feature Dramatic Battle against the entire roster of characters, as all other versions limit this mode to boss characters only. The AI for dramatic battle is far superior than the Playstation version, other minor changes are revised scoring for some moves in the game (E.g. many characters that earn 3000pts per hit from a grab move (A very important fact to exploit for World Tour mode, where the score is the player's experience points) do not receive so much in the Saturn version). The features, characters etc of the first home port on the Playstation are available straight away for the Saturn version.

* ''Street Fighter Zero 3'' was re-released for the arcades in Japan in {{vgy|2001}} under the title of ''Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper'' (officially promoted as ''Street Fighter Zero 3↑''). The game was released for the Dreamcast-based [[Sega Naomi|NAOMI]] hardware (rather than the original game's CP System II hardware) and features all 6 characters from the console ports and some balance changes, most notably removal of "crouch canceling" glitch which allowed V-ISM infinite combos. ''Upper'' also allows players to upload any customized characters from the Dreamcast version of the game by inserting a [[VMU]] into a memory card slot on the cabinet.

* A Game Boy Advance version developed by [[Crawfish Interactive]] was released in {{vgy|2002}} under the title ''Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper''. The port is compressed and lacks several stages and music tracks from the previous arcade and console versions, although all of the characters are present. In addition, [[Eagle (Street Fighter)|Eagle]], [[Maki Genryusai|Maki]], and [[Yun and Yang|Yun]], all whom were characters from ''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]'' (released in 2001), were also added to the game. Only a small amount of character voices were included in this version due to storage limitations, which the developers worked around by having characters share voice samples, modified with real-time pitch shifting, such as using a higher pitched version of [[Ken Masters|Ken]]{{'}}s voice for Sakura's attack calls.

* The [[PlayStation Portable]] version, titled ''Street Fighter Alpha 3 MAX'' (''Street Fighter Zero 3 Double Upper'' in Japan, officially promoted as ''Street Fighter Zero 3↑↑''), was released in {{vgy|2006}} and features the additional characters from the GBA version as well as Ingrid from ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]''. This version is a near faithful port of the arcade version with minimal (almost non-existent) loading times and all frames and sprites intact. All of the added characters now feature their own in-game storylines and endings. The Dramatic Battle mode in this version is the only one where both the player and partner characters can be selected individually (allowing for any character pairing). It also includes the Reverse Dramatic Battle mode from the Saturn version, an exclusive tag mode called "Variable Battle", which is similar to Dramatic Battle but players can tag in and out their partner, and a mode called "100 Kumite" (a 100 fight series).

* ''[[Street Fighter Alpha Anthology]]'' (''Street Fighter Zero: Fighters' Generation'' in Japan) was released in 2006 for the [[PlayStation 2]]. It contains the arcade version of ''Alpha 3'' as one of the immediately available games, along with a revised version of ''Alpha 3 Upper'' as a secret game. Being a compilation of arcade games, the World Tour Mode that was featured in the previous home ports is not included, nor are the extra characters introduced in the portable versions of the game, although it uses the soundtracks from the home versions. In ''Upper'', all of the characters are readily available.

*Street Fighter Alpha 3 has an arcade perfect inclusion via [[Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection]] for the Playstation 4 Xbox One Nintendo Switch &amp; Steam. The original 28 characters appear in the title and those introduced in the GBA PS2 and PSP versions are not included due to the game running on its original version through emulation. Save States are put in place to allow the player to continue with progress and this title alongside Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, Super Street Fighter II Turbo &amp; Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike - Fight for the Future each have online functionality.

On release, ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored the Sega Saturn version of the game a 32 out of 40;&lt;ref name=fam-sat&gt;''Weekly Famitsu'', [http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=883 No. 405]&lt;/ref&gt; they later scored it 30 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;''セガサターン – ストリートファイターZERO3''.

The ''[[Official UK PlayStation Magazine]]'' said that the game would outlast ''[[Tekken 3]]'', and stated "the only thing to tarnish this is the graphics. So if you think gameplay is more important than texture-mapped polygons, consider the score to be a ten."&lt;ref name="OPM_PS"/&gt;

'''''The Book of Unwritten Tales''''' is a [[point-and-click]] [[adventure game|adventure]] video game created by German developer [[King Art Games]]. A prequel called ''[[The Book of Unwritten Tales: The Critter Chronicles]]'' was released in 2012. A sequel, ''[[The Book of Unwritten Tales 2]]'', was released on February 20, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingart-games.de/en/blog/the-book-of-unwritten-tales-2-release-2/ |title=The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 Release!!! |website=King Art Games |date=February 20, 2015 |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221151445/http://www.kingart-games.de/en/blog/the-book-of-unwritten-tales-2-release-2/ |archivedate=February 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The game challenges the player with a series of [[puzzle]]s and [[brain teaser]]s presented as a traditional [[Point-and-click adventure|point and click]] adventure game. The puzzles are embedded in an [[adventure]] story that take most players an average of 20 hours to complete. There are 60 locations to explore with a total of 40 [[non-player character]]s and about 250 interactible items.

A notable feature of ''The Book of Unwritten Tales'' is that the player controls four different characters. In some scenes it is possible to switch between two or three active characters. Making explicit use of this mechanic, some puzzles require the playable characters to exchange items or otherwise cooperate.

== Plot ==
{{more plot|date=June 2018}}

In a world torn by war, the aged [[gremlin]] archaeologist Mortimer McGuffin harbors the dark secret of a powerful artifact. Whoever calls this artifact its own will determine the fate of the world. While the Army of Shadows sends out its best and most devious agents to discover the secret, the Alliance's three heroes find themselves involuntarily drawn into the crisis...

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400-700 words only, the summary has over 669 words currently. Detailed actions and sequences should be avoided; DO NOT AT ALL ADD TO THE SUMMARY UNLESS NECESSARY. --&gt;
A [[Archaic humans|cave family]] called the Croods survives, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn, stern patriarch, father, Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home.

Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a [[torch]] of fire, and she encounters an inventive [[anatomically modern human|modern human]] boy named Guy and his [[pet]] [[sloth]] Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are "different" and "new", they destroy her horn.

A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a "Macawnivore", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs "Chunky", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground [[whale]]. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired, but Grug doesn't listen.

When Grug finds a bird, he decides to hunt its egg for dinner. Eep also wants to hunt the egg, but as she's grounded, she gets replaced by Thunk, who is too lazy to hunt it. Grug and Thunk fail to capture the bird's egg, so they get a scorpion instead. During a fight between Thunk and Gran, Eep notices Guy moving away and stops him. Guy wants Eep to stop, so he makes her hunt with him. Eep goes with Guy to hunt, while the others fight among themselves.

Eep and Guy make a trap in order to capture the bird but fail when the two get tangled up, and the bird doesn’t step in the trap. The bird captures the puppet with Guy in it and throws him up in the sky until he lands on the log. Grug asks Guy where Eep is, and he finds her being chased by the bird. Grug gets angry but doesn’t notice that he was about to step on the trap, so Eep pushes him out to save her father. The bird steps on the trap and is thrown up in the sky until it crash-lands on the ground.

The Croods cook the bird, and Guy is tied up with a root chain on his right leg. After dinner, Grug tells them a story, which is based on a true story, about a tiger who is similar to Eep and embarrasses Eep. Guy says that his stories never end up like Grug’s stories, so the Croods decide to listen to Guy’s story much to their interest. Guy tells them about a tiger who flew into a place with more suns in the sky called “Tomorrow”. Guy also tells them stories of "Tomorrow", a heaven of safety where he is headed and in which curiosity is not deadly as Grug has claimed.

Outrunning the destruction, Guy is trusted enough to be let out of the log, and he gives the Croods rudimentary shoes to walk over the harsh landscape as he leads them to a mountain in which he says will be safe. After the family is split up in a labyrinth of tunnels, all but Grug manage to escape by coming up with ideas of overcoming obstacles in their paths. At his treetop home, Grug sees the impression Guy is leaving on his family, and he becomes jealous, especially when he realizes that Eep has fallen in love with Guy. Attempting to invent things like Guy, Grug only further embarrasses himself and drives his family further away from him.

Reaching the mountain, Grug tries to force his family to hide out in a cave, but they resist, telling him that they can't live in caves anymore, that they don't want to survive but to live. This enrages Grug, who attacks Guy and both of them end up in a [[tar]] flow where Grug learns that Guy's family had perished in one. Realizing that Guy's method of survival is better for his family, Grug works with him, and they lure Chunky into a trap to free themselves. The family reunites, then flees a massive cataclysm as the land begins to violently rip apart.

The family is cut off from their destination by a continental split, but Grug, realizing the errors of his ways, decides to throw his family to safety. He shares an invention he calls a "hug" with Eep, briefly before sending her across as well. Cut off from his family, Grug finds a cave for safety, where he encounters Chunky, who is truly a frightened and sweet feline, and he comes up with an idea to getting them across the chasm. Using a ribcage and the Piranhakeets to fashion a simple airship, Grug manages to send themselves, and several animals the family had encountered during their journey, across the chasm, reuniting with his family once again. He apologizes to them all and promises to never be so overbearing again. Later, the Croods have settled on a vast beach, where every day they can follow the light to "Tomorrow".

The website's critical consensus reads: "While it may not be as (ahem) evolved as the best modern animated fare, ''The Croods'' will prove solidly entertaining for families seeking a fast-paced, funny cartoon adventure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-croods/ |title= The Croods (2013) |publisher= [[Fandango Media]] | work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, the film was given a score of 55 based on 30 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-croods |title=The Croods Reviews |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]] | work= [[Metacritic]] |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying, "A visually dazzling animated adventure with a well chosen voice cast is hampered by lackluster humor and a meandering story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Puig|first=Claudia |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/03/21/the-croods-review/1967491/ |title='The Croods' hunts down humor, gathers great talent |work=[[USA Today]] |date=March 21, 2013 |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Russo of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film two and a half out of four, saying, "Had the movie figured out a way to stay the less cliched course, it might have helped the DreamWorks oeuvre take steps toward [[Pixar]]'s emotional resonance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russo|first=Tom|title=‘The Croods’ explores the modern Stone Age family|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/2013/03/21/movie-review-the-croods/bhsfFSUsPSc60Jon7a7GKO/story.html|accessdate=May 4, 2013|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaw group of companies and MCG Capital, a leading specialized financial services company and financial advisor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewrelease.com/aboutus2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713192132/http://www.thenewrelease.com/aboutus2.htm |archivedate=2007-07-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Each of its interactive kiosks held up to 1,000 DVDs, including new releases and classic titles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=4572 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063541/http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=4572 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  To rent a movie, consumers swiped their credit card, make their selection and the machine then dispensed the movie(s).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The charge per rental was $1 per day; and keeping a DVD more than 14 days was effectively the same as purchasing the DVD.

The kiosks were located at grocery stores including [[Albertson's]], Dillon’s, [[Kroger]], [[Publix]] and others—and promotions included a “Movie Lover’s Survey,” “Movie For a Year” and a “First Movie Free.”

The company also operated kiosks under the name "moviecube," a California company which it acquired.

==History==
Founded in 2002, The New Release focused primarily on the grocery channel.  The first kiosks were installed in [[Houston]], HEB locations, with later expansion into [[Dallas]], Kroger locations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Acquired by NCR in 2009, its kiosks eventually became the property of Redbox when Redbox acquired all of NCR's DVD rental kiosks in 2012.

==Promotions==
The New Release periodically created promotions to entice current consumers and attract new ones.  The New Release held a “Movie Lover’s Survey,” where they gave away free movies to the first 500 respondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pricenetwork.ca/showthread.php?threadid=128286&amp;cs=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008204115/http://www.pricenetwork.ca/showthread.php?threadid=128286&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=2007-10-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The New Release gave away “Movie For a Year” to 45 customers throughout North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kiosknews.blogspot.com/2007/03/tnr-entertainment-introduces-win-movies.html|title=TNR Entertainment introduces 'Win Movies for a Year' promotion at DVD kiosks|first=Bill|last=Gerba|date=22 March 2007|website=Kiosknews.blogspot.com|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, The New Release produced a “First Movie Free” promotion in many of its locations nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=16450 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928063505/http://www.selfserviceworld.com/article.php?id=16450 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16321">'''''The Oh, Hello Show''''' is a comedy act created by Americans [[Nick Kroll]] and [[John Mulaney]] that was popularized on [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Kroll Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2567098/|title=The Oh, Hello Show (2008– )|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/09/kroll-show-oh-hello_n_2438709.html |title=Kroll Show's 'Oh Hello': Nick Kroll &amp; John Mulaney Are Upper West Side Divorcees (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/search?keywords=st.+geegland |title=Search &amp;#124; Comedy Central Official Site &amp;#124; ComedyCentral.com |publisher=Cc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show centers on Gil Faizon (Kroll) and George St. Geegland (Mulaney), elderly men from the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;who are known for their turtlenecks, misinformed beliefs, and tendency to say "Oh, hello" in unison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/watch-oh-hello-stars-gil-faizon-and-george-st-geeg-214269 |title=Watch "Oh, Hello" stars Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland drop in at 92Y · Great Job, Internet! · The A.V.

==Origins==
Kroll and Mulaney developed Faizon and St. Geegland after watching two men wearing turtlenecks and blazers at The Strand bookstore purchase separate copies of [[Alan Alda|Alan Alda's]] book ''Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: And Other Things I've Learned''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fliiby.com/file/163r47mtgl/]{{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Bradford |url=http://splitsider.com/2013/01/watch-nick-kroll-and-john-mulaney-reprise-their-oh-hello-characters-for-kroll-show/ |title=Watch Nick Kroll and John Mulaney Reprise Their "Oh, Hello" Characters for 'Kroll Show' |publisher=Splitsider |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early 2000s, Faizon and St. Geegland hosted a weekly show at Rififi, a New York comedy club that closed down in 2008. It was during this time that Kroll and Mulaney were able to hone their characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sean Fitz-Gerald |url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/04/25-comedians-reminisce-about-rififi.html |title=25 Comedians Reminisce About Rififi |publisher=Vulture |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eakin |first=Marah |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/we-really-used-every-piece-cow-nick-kroll-walks-us-216945 |title="We really used every piece of the cow": Nick Kroll walks us through Kroll Show · The Walkthrough · The A.V.

==Characters==
Roommates George and Gil are in their 70s and have strong [[New York accents]], and they frequently mispronounce common words and names. For example, they refer to [[Ashton Kutcher]]'s show ''[[Punk'd]]'' as ''Prank'd''; [[Johnny Knoxville]] as Johnny Nashville, and ''[[Candid Camera]]'' as ''Candy Camera''. They also frequently put the stress on the wrong syllables of words, for example, pronouncing [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as "Broad''way''" and [[junk mail]]{{dn|date=December 2018}} as "junk ''mail''". They both have shaggy gray hair and beards, wear glasses, and wear baggy clothes for an overall unkempt appearance. They met in Toronto while dodging the [[Vietnam War]], but they did their part for the war effort by fighting with Asians they saw in Canada. George is an author and playwright and has written several shows for him and Gil to star in, usually not being well received by their audiences. They have a dog named [[Paul Giamatti|Pug Giamatti]], but he left for an adventure in [[Saugerties, New York|Saugerties]].&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

===Gil Faizon===
Gil's birth name is Gil Cosby, but he took his wife's last name of Faizon.&lt;ref name="decider1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://decider.com/2015/01/23/kroll-show-oh-hello-92y/ |title=Did You Miss Nick Kroll &amp; John Mulaney As Their "Oh Hello" Characters At The 92Y?

He had a Bar Mitzvah and his Torah portion was an [[Archie (comic book)|Archie]] comic. Faizon, who has more of a Brooklyn Jewish accent, often introduces himself as "Charmed I'm sure, Gil Faizon." He is also a stand-in model for mashed potatoes and other creamed foods.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{Citation|last=92Y Plus|title=Nick Kroll and John Mulaney: A Night with Kroll Show's "Oh Hello"|date=2015-01-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkitRyvdtJY|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gil's father reportedly "ratted out other Jews during [[the Holocaust]]." He suffers from bagel-induced cholesterol&lt;ref name="decider1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/mqs4wm/kroll-show-meet-george-and-gil |title=Meet George and Gil - Kroll Show Video Clip &amp;#124; Comedy Central |publisher=Cc.com |date=2014-12-17 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eczema]].

===George St. Geegland===
Geegland was possibly born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] or [[Newark, New Jersey]], to verbally abusive parents sometime in the mid-1940s. He was responsible for reintroducing the [[polio]] virus to his school district.  His family is Presbyterian and Dutch from St. Geegland, Van Dutch. In college, he majored in penmanship.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; Geegland, a former short story professor at the fictitious [[State University of New York|SUNY]] Yonkers, is the more aggressive of the two characters.&lt;ref name="decider1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdIU6Rf4qBA |title=Kroll Show - Oh, Hello - George and Gil at the Y |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often yells at others, makes racist comments, and may have raped a student.&lt;ref name="Cc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt; His behavior indicates that he may be a [[psychopath]]. Geegland's unwritten novel, ''Rifkin's Dilemma'', is about the boyhood of a man with a fondness for [[masturbation]].&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt; He's been married three times. All of his wives died the same way on the same staircase. His first wife's name was Inertia Bernstein.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; He was divorced at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce4mCXk3ye8 |title=Kroll Show - Oh, Hello - A Heart-to-Heart with Dr. Neuringer |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-08-29 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spalding Gray]] personally disliked him, and he has chapped hands.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

==Television appearances==

===''Kroll Show''===
The characters of Faizon and St. Geegland were heavily popularized on Kroll's self-titled [[Comedy Central]] show, ''[[Kroll Show]]'' (2013–15), where they appeared in 11 episodes. They were presented through several different formats, including a variety of sketches, and the prank show '''''Too Much Tuna''''', as hosts of a public access prank show in which unsuspecting contestants are given [[tuna fish sandwich]]es with "too much tuna". They usually ruined the prank by telling the contestant that a tuna fish sandwich was coming before the plate of food arrived.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Genius.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1981538/epcast|title=Episodes cast for "Kroll Show" (2013)|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/nickkroll/status/289106431272181760 |title=nick kroll on Twitter: "oh hello... TOO MUCH TUNA is gil faizon &amp; george st geegland's new prank show w/ @JoeMande &amp; john @mulaney"  |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Too Much Tuna'' also carried over to their stage show.

===''Late Night with Seth Meyers''===
The duo has appeared in character as guests on two episodes of ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]'', promoting the [[Off-Broadway]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] runs of ''Oh, Hello''. Host [[Seth Meyers]] is a friend of both Kroll and Mulaney, having previously worked with Mulaney as a writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[Documentary Now!]]''.

===''Comedy Bang! Bang!''===
Faizon and St. Geegland have also appeared as guests in a season five episode of [[Scott Aukerman|Scott Aukerman's]] [[IFC (U.S. TV network)|IFC]] show ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'', alongside [[The Lonely Island]]. During their appearance, they talked about their extensive Broadway background, which includes producing the ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''-inspired show ''Pugs'' and ''You Snooze, You Lose'', a musical about the [[Terri Schiavo case]]. They have also appeared on several episodes of the original ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'' podcast.

===''Conan''===
Kroll and Mulaney have appeared in character on an episode of [[Conan O'Brien]]'s [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] talk-show ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]''. The appearance occurred during O'Brien's week of shows taped from the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[New York City]], which coincided with the run of ''Oh, Hello'' on Broadway. George and Gil appeared during the monologue to give O'Brien a "welcome-back-to-New York-official-basket", consisting of a pre-broken umbrella, a sun-faded photo of [[Danny Aiello]], a cup of three-week old watermelon, a copy of ''[[Donald Fagen|Fagen]]'s New York'', and a gift certificate to St Michael's Cemetery.

===''Chelsea''===
To promote ''Oh, Hello on Broadway'', Kroll and Mulaney appeared in two episodes of the [[Netflix]] talk show ''[[Chelsea (TV series)|Chelsea]]'' as Faizon and St. Geegland. Host [[Chelsea Handler]] also uses "Oh, hello" as her catchphrase to open each show.

===''Portlandia''===
Faizon and St. Geegland appear in the sketch comedy series ''[[Portlandia (TV series)|Portlandia]]'' in the episode "[[Portlandia (season 8)#ep75|Peter Follows P!nk]]" where they meet series mainstays Toni and Candace ([[Carrie Brownstein]] and [[Fred Armisen]]) and invite them to a [[Murder|surprise assisted suicide party]].

==''Oh, Hello'' on Broadway==
''Oh, Hello'' premiered as an off-Broadway play on December 1, 2015 and played for several weeks at The [[Cherry Lane Theatre]] in New York's Greenwich Village.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cherrylanetheatre.org/history/past/oh-hello/|title=Oh, Hello {{!}} History {{!}} Cherry Lane Theatre|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cherrylanetheatre.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of this production, Kroll and Mulaney took the show on the road, performing in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Boston.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-nick-kroll-john-mulaney-oh-hello-20160424-story.html "Nick Kroll, John Mulaney add another date for sold-out 'Oh, Hello'"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroll and Mulaney began a 15-week staging of the show on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theater]], starting on September 22, 2016, in previews and on October 10 officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohhellobroadway.com|title=Oh, Hello On Broadway|website=Oh, Hello On Broadway|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Viagas, Robert.

[[Ben Brantley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' helped launch the show's success by giving it an unexpected rave review during its off-Broadway run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sims |first=Dave |date=June 13, 2017 |title=The Marvelous Specificity of Oh, Hello Comes to Netflix |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/06/the-marvelous-specificity-of-oh-hello-comes-to-netflix/530040/ |work=The Atlantic Monthly |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it "full of genuine laughs", but also "surprisingly unambitious, with no real story, no attempt to welcome new audiences, no truly great comic moments. It’s a sketch, drawn out", giving it a "B".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Oxfeld |first=Jesse |date=October 10, 2016 |title=Oh, Hello: EW stage review |url=http://ew.com/article/2016/10/10/oh-hello-broadway-ew-stage-review/ |work=Entertainment Weekly |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marilyn Stasio of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that "Their pre-established fan base from Comedy Central, alt-comedy clubs and obscure videos should go for this sloppy, silly, occasionally inspired, extended version of their comic shtick as two affected Upper West Side geezers named Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland — but ''Oh, Hello on Broadway'' might not be the show to win over new enthusiasts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stasio |first=Marilyn |date=October 20, 2016 |title=Broadway Review: ‘Oh, Hello on Broadway’ |url=https://variety.com/2016/legit/reviews/oh-hello-on-broadway-review-1201883691/ |work=Variety |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recorded performance of the show featuring [[Steve Martin]] as the guest and with an appearance by [[Matthew Broderick]] was released by [[Netflix]] on June 13, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lenker|first1=Maureen Lee|title=Oh, Hello on Broadway is coming to Netflix|url=http://ew.com/theater/2017/05/18/oh-hello-on-broadway-netflix/|date=May 18, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bonus clip was also released on Netflix featuring [[Michael J. Fox]] as the guest. The recorded performance received a positive review from Erik Adams of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', who gave it a "B+" and called it "a singularly funny testament to Kroll and Mulaney’s creative partnership and personal friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Erik|title=Only Nick Kroll and John Mulaney could’ve (or should’ve) come up with ''Oh, Hello''|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/only-nick-kroll-and-john-mulaney-couldve-or-should-256710|work=A.V. Club|date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lea Palmieri of Decider wrote that "''Oh, Hello On Broadway'' might be the most ridiculous Broadway show you watch on Netflix this year, but it’s absolutely worth watching." She noted, however, that "trimming about 15 minutes wouldn’t have hurt the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmieri|first1=Lea|title=‘Oh, Hello On Broadway’: John Mulaney And Nick Kroll Bring Their Grumpy Geezers To The Big Stage|work=Decider|url=http://decider.com/2017/06/13/oh-hello-on-broadway-netflix-review/|date=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turner Classic Movies''' ('''TCM''') is an [[United States|American]] [[movie channel|movie-oriented]] [[pay television|pay-TV]] [[television network|network]] operated by [[Turner Broadcasting System]], a subsidiary of [[AT&amp;T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]. Launched in 1994, TCM is headquartered at Turner's Techwood broadcasting campus in the [[Midtown Atlanta|Midtown]] business district of [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

Historically, the channel's programming consisted mainly of [[Golden age (metaphor)|classic]] theatrically released [[feature film]]s from the [[Turner Entertainment]] film library – which comprises films from [[Warner Bros.]] (covering films released before 1950) and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (covering films released before May 1986).

However, TCM now has licensing deals with other Hollywood [[film studio]]s as well as its WarnerMedia sister company, Warner Bros. (which now controls the Turner Entertainment library and its own later films), and occasionally shows more recent films.

The channel is available in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Malta]], [[Latin America]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Spain]], the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]] and [[Asia-Pacific]].

==History==
===Origins===
In 1986, eight years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, [[Ted Turner]] acquired the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film studio for $1.5 billion. Concerns over [[Turner Entertainment]]'s corporate [[debt]] load resulted in [[Turner Entertainment#Background|Turner selling the studio]] that October back to [[Kirk Kerkorian]], from whom Turner had purchased the studio less than a year before.&lt;ref name="Fabrikant"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/07/business/turner-to-sell-mgm-assets.html Fabrikant, Geraldine. "Turner to Sell MGM Assets."] ''[[The New York Times]].'' June 7, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the deal, Turner Entertainment retained ownership of MGM's library of films released up to May 9, 1986. [[Turner Broadcasting System]] was split into two companies; Turner Broadcasting System and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and reincorporated as [[MGM/UA Communications Co.]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The film library of Turner Entertainment would serve as the base form of programming for TCM upon the network's launch. Before the creation of Turner Classic Movies, films from Turner's library of movies aired on the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]'s advertiser-supported cable network [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] – along with [[colorized]] versions of black-and-white classics such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''.

After the library was acquired, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] signed a deal with [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] to continue distributing the pre-May 1986 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and to begin distributing the pre-1950 [[Warner Bros.]] film libraries for video release (the rest of the library went to [[Turner Home Entertainment]]).

===Launch and contributions===

[[File:Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh at the 68th Annual Peabody Awards for Turner Classic Movies.jpg|thumb|In May 2009, host Robert Osborne and Charles Tabesh, senior vice president for programming, accepted TCM's Institutional [[Peabody Award]] "for a continuing, powerful commitment to a central concept—the place of film in social and cultural experience".&lt;ref name="Peabody"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/institutional-award-turner-classic-movies |title=The Peabody Awards, Institutional Award: Turner Classic Movies (TCM) |publisher=Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, University of Georgia |access-date=2018-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Turner Classic Movies debuted on April 14, 1994, at 6&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], with [[Ted Turner]] launching the channel at a ceremony in [[New York City]]'s [[Times Square]] district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15426709.html Mitchell, Kim; Rod Granger. "Turner launches TCM"], ''[[Multichannel News]]'', April 18, 1994. Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4223379.html Lon Grahnke. "Classic Films Find New Cable Outlet In Turner Empire"], ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', April 10, 1994. Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; The date and time were chosen for their historical significance as "the exact centennial anniversary of the first public movie showing in New York City". The first movie broadcast on TCM was the 1939 film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the same film that served as the debut broadcast of its sister channel [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] six years earlier in October 1988.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}
At the time of its launch, TCM was available to approximately one million cable television subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15308051.html Brown, Rich. "Few tickets for Turner Classic Movies"], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', April 18, 1994. Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

The network originally served as a competitor to [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]—which at the time was known as "American Movie Classics" and maintained a virtually identical format to TCM, as both networks largely focused on films released prior to 1970 and aired them in an uncut, [[colorizing|uncolorized]], and commercial-free format. AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films by 2002.

In the early 2000s, AMC abandoned its commercial-free format, which then led to TCM being the only movie-oriented cable channel to devote its programming entirely to classic films without commercial interruption.

In 1996, [[Turner Broadcasting System]] merged with [[Time Warner]] which, besides placing Turner Classic Movies and [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Entertainment]] under the same corporate umbrella, also gave TCM access to Warner Bros.' library of films released after 1950 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the [[Lorimar Television|Lorimar]], [[Saul Zaentz]] and National General Pictures libraries); incidentally, TCM had already been running select [[Warner Bros.]] film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14791509.html "Turner picks up Warner films"], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', December 6, 1993. Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research:&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] paid [[Warner Bros.]] and gave up the home video rights to the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] films owned by [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]] to [[Warner Home Video]].

===TCM Young Composers Film Competition===

In 2000, TCM started the annual Young Composers Film Competition, inviting aspiring composers to participate in a judged competition that offers the winner of each year's competition the opportunity to score a restored, feature-length [[silent film]] as a grand prize, mentored by a well-known composer, with the new work subsequently premiering on the network. As of 2006, films that have been rescored include the 1921 [[Rudolph Valentino]] film ''[[Camille (1921 film)|Camille]]'', two [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] films: 1921's ''[[The Ace of Hearts (1921 film)|The Ace of Hearts]]'' and 1928's ''[[Laugh, Clown, Laugh]]'', and [[Greta Garbo]]'s 1926 film ''[[The Temptress]]''.

===TCM Classic Film Festival===

In April 2010, Turner Classic Movies held the first TCM Classic Film Festival, an event—now held annually—at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]] and the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theater]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Initially hosted by [[Robert Osborne]], the four-day long annual festival celebrates Hollywood and its movies, and featured celebrity appearances, special events, and screenings of around 50 classic movies including several newly restored by ''[[The Film Foundation]]'', an organization devoted to preserving Hollywood's classic film legacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605175654/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/item_3Wjf7vaaMrf7c6PHAaIJ3N |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 5, 2011 |title=New TCM Film Festival goes head-to-head with Tribeca |publisher=New York Post |date=November 5, 2009 |first=Lou |last=Lumenick |accessdate=2012-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Turner Classic Movies essentially operates as a [[television commercial|commercial]]-free service, with the only advertisements on the network being shown between features – which advertise TCM products, [[Promo (media)|network promotions]] for upcoming special programs and the original [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for films that are scheduled to be broadcast on TCM (particularly those that will air during the primetime hours), and featurettes about classic film actors and actresses. In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects – from series such as ''The Passing Parade'', ''Crime Does Not Pay'', ''[[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith Specialties]]'', and [[Robert Benchley]] – under the banner name ''TCM Extras'' (formerly ''One Reel Wonders''). In 2007, some of the [[short film]]s featured on TCM were made available for [[streaming media|streaming]] on TCM's website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.

TCM's film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or [[post-production|post-produced]] in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[MPAA film ratings system|ratings system]] and the concurrent disestablishment of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]]. Because of this, TCM is formatted similarly to a [[pay television|premium channel]] with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring [[nudity]], sexual content, [[violence]] and/or strong [[profanity]]; the network also features rating [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] prior to the start of a program (most programs on TCM, especially films, are rated for content using the [[TV Parental Guidelines]], in lieu of the MPAA's rating system).

The network's programming season runs from February until the following March of each year when a retrospective of [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called ''[[31 Days of Oscar]]''. As a result of its devoted format to classic [[feature film]]s, viewers who are interested in tracing the career development of actresses such as [[Barbara Stanwyck]] or [[Greta Garbo]] or actors like [[Cary Grant]] or [[Humphrey Bogart]] have the unique opportunity to see most of the films that were made during their careers, from beginning to end. Turner Classic Movies presents many of its features in their original [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] ([[widescreen]] or full screen) whenever possible – widescreen films broadcast on TCM are [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] on the network's [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] feed. TCM also regularly presents widescreen presentations of films not available in the format on any [[home video]] release.

Occasionally, TCM shows restored versions of films, particularly old [[silent film]]s with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies is also a major backer of the [[Descriptive Video Service]] (created by [[Boston]] [[PBS]] member station [[WGBH-TV]]), with many of the films aired on the network offering [[video description|visual description]] for the [[blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]], which is accessible through the [[second audio program]] option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver.

===''Now Playing''===
TCM publishes ''Now Playing'', a monthly guide, originally available through a standalone subscription, which provides daily listings and descriptions for films scheduled to air on Turner Classic Movies in the coming month. The digest-size magazine highlights a featured actor on the cover, and features essays about the "guest programmer" as well as a movie-and-actor themed crossword puzzle. The May 2017 issue, following the death in March 2017 of host [[Robert Osborne]], contained "Remembering Robert Osborne" by [[Ben Mankiewicz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TCM:NOW PLAYING: A Viewer's Guide to Turner Classic Movies.|publisher=Turner Classic Movies|date=May 2017|location=Palm Coast, Florida|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCM ceased print publication of ''Now Playing'' (which had been one of the few channel-specific program guides that remained in print circulation for most of the 2000s and 2010s) with the August 2017 issue, moving it to an electronic format available via email free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;"TCM To Cease Printing the Now Playing Guide" http://mercurie.blogspot.com/2017/04/tcm-to-cease-printing-now-playing-guide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movie library===
TCM's library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles. Besides its deals to broadcast film releases from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-16467574.html Katz, Richard. "TCM purchases large MGM/UA film package"], ''[[Multichannel News]]'', November 21, 1994. Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and Warner Bros. Entertainment, Turner Classic Movies also maintains movie licensing rights agreements with [[Universal Studios]], [[Paramount Pictures]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13266775.html Brown, Rich.

Most Paramount sound releases made prior to 1950 are owned by [[EMKA, Ltd.]]/[[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]], while Paramount (currently owned by [[Viacom]]) holds on to most of its post-1949 releases, which are distributed for television by [[Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media]]. Columbia's film output is owned by [[Sony]] (through [[Sony Pictures Television]]); distribution of 20th Century Fox's film library is handled for television by its [[21st Century Fox]] subsidiary [[20th Television]], and the Walt Disney Studios (owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]]) has its library film output handled for television by [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]]. Classic films released by 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and Columbia Pictures are licensed individually for broadcast on Turner Classic Movies.

Also TCM has aired movies from the 1900s, 1910s and the 1920s. Although most movies shown on TCM are releases from the 1930s to the 1960s, some are more contemporary – Turner Classic Movies sometimes airs films from the 1970s and 1980s, and occasionally broadcasts movies released during the 1990s and the early 2000s.

===Hosted and special programming===
====Regular features====
[[File:Robert Osborne at the 73rd Annual Peabody Awards.jpg|175px|thumb|right|TCM prime time host Robert Osborne at the 73rd Annual Peabody Awards (May 2014)]]
Most feature movies shown during the [[prime time]] and early overnight hours (8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time) were presented by the late film historian [[Robert Osborne]] (who had been with the network since its 1994 launch until 2016, except for a five-month medical leave from July to December 2011, when guest hosts presented each night's films),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Lou | last=Lumenick | title=Robert Osborne taking leave from TCM | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/robert_osborne_taking_leave_from_lQNj8sE5YfsOP9EA3nJ9TM | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913190429/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/movies/robert_osborne_taking_leave_from_lQNj8sE5YfsOP9EA3nJ9TM | dead-url=yes | archive-date=September 13, 2012 | work=[[The New York Post]] | date=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Mankiewicz]] presenting only late evening films on Wednesday through Sunday evenings, and the "Silent Sunday Nights" and "TCM Imports" blocks on Sundays, Tiffany Vasquez presenting the films on Saturday afternoons from 2016-2018, Dave Karger presenting the films on Saturday afternoons and the primetime films on Mondays and Alicia Malone presenting the films on Sunday afternoons and the primetime films on Tuesdays.

TCM regularly airs a "Star of the Month" throughout the year on Wednesdays starting at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time, in which most, if not all, feature films from a classic film star are shown during that night's schedule. February and August are the only months to not have a "Star of the Month". The network also marks the occurrence of a film actor's birthday (either [[Wikt:antemortem|antemortem]] or posthumously) or recent death with day- or evening-long festivals showcasing several of that artist's best, earliest or least-known pictures; by effect, marathons scheduled in honor of an actor's passing (which are scheduled within a month after their death) pre-empt films originally scheduled to air on that date. TCM also features a monthly program block called the "TCM Guest Programmer", in which Osborne is joined by celebrity guests responsible for choosing that evening's films (examples of such programmers during 2012 include [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Anthony Bourdain]], [[Debra Winger]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Regis Philbin]] and [[Jim Lehrer]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= TCM Announces Guest Programmers for 2012, Including Jules Feiffer, Anthony Bourdain, Debra Winger, Ellen Barkin, Spike Lee, Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer | url= http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/tcm-announces-guest-programmers-for-2012-including-jules-feiffer-anthony-bourdain-debra-winger-ellen-barkin-spike-lee-regis-philbin-and-jim-lehrer/121401/ | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120227024440/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/22/tcm-announces-guest-programmers-for-2012-including-jules-feiffer-anthony-bourdain-debra-winger-ellen-barkin-spike-lee-regis-philbin-and-jim-lehrer/121401/ | dead-url= yes | archive-date= February 27, 2012 | date= February 22, 2012| first=Sara|last= Bibel | work= Press release | accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; an offshoot of this block featuring Turner Classic Movies employees aired during February 2011.

Turner Classic Movies also airs regularly scheduled weekly film blocks, which are periodically preempted for special themed month-long or seasonal scheduling events, such as the "31 Days of Oscar" film series in the month preceding the Academy Awards and the month-long "Summer Under the Stars" in August; all featured programming has their own distinctive feature presentation bumper for the particular scheduled presentation. ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'', with various hosts from 2001 through 2015, was a weekly film showcase airing on Saturday evenings (with a replay on the following Sunday at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time), which spotlighted a different movie and contained a special introduction and post-movie discussion.

One of the weekly blocks is "Noir Alley", featuring [[film noir]] movies. It broadcasts on Sunday mornings and is hosted by [[Eddie Muller]]. The channel also broadcasts two movie blocks during the late evening hours each Sunday: "Silent Sunday Nights", which features [[silent film]]s from the United States and abroad, usually in the latest restored version and often with new musical scores; and "TCM Imports" (which previously ran on Saturdays until the early 2000s{{Specify|date=March 2012}}), a weekly presentation of films originally released in foreign countries. ''[[TCM Underground]]'' – which debuted in October 2006 – as Saturday late night block which focuses on [[cult film]]s, the block was originally hosted by rocker/filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]] until December 2006 (though {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, it is the only regular film presentation block on the channel that does not have a host). ''[[TCM Underground]]'' recently changed its timeslot - it now airs Friday mornings at 2AM.

====Seasonal blocks====
Each August, Turner Classic Movies suspends its regular schedule for a special month of film marathons called "Summer Under the Stars", which features entire daily schedules devoted to the work of a particular actor, with movies and specials that pertain to the star of the day. In the summer of 2007, the channel debuted "Funday Night at the Movies", a block hosted by actor [[Tom Kenny]] (best known as the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]]). This summer block featured classic feature films (such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'', ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'', and ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'') aimed at introducing these movies to new generations of children, and their families.

"Funday Night at the Movies" was replaced in 2008 by "Essentials Jr.", a youth-oriented version of its weekly series, ''[[The Essentials (TCM)|The Essentials]]'' (originally hosted by actors [[Abigail Breslin]], and [[Chris O'Donnell]], then by [[John Lithgow]] from 2009 to 2011, and then by [[Bill Hader]], starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as ''[[National Velvet (film)|National Velvet]]'', ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'', and ''[[Yours, Mine and Ours (1968 film)|Yours, Mine and Ours]]'', as well as more eclectic selections, such as ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]'', ''[[The Music Box]]'', ''[[Harvey (film)|Harvey]]'', ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]'', and ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]''.

In 2014, the channel debuted "Treasures from the Disney Vault", hosted by [[Leonard Maltin]]. This block showcases a compilation of vintage [[Disney]] feature films, cartoons, documentaries, episodes of the ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series]]'', and episodes of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney|publisher=TCM.com|url=http://www.tcm.com/disney/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasures from The Disney Vault|publisher=Turner.com|url=http://i.cdn.turner.com/v5cache/TCM/2015/00112255/images/Treasures_from_The_Disney_Vault_Schedule.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/disney/ride.html|title=Disney Ride|publisher=TCM.com|access-date=2016-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725154524/http://www.tcm.com/disney/ride.html|archive-date=2016-07-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.cdn.turner.com/v5cache/TCM/2015/00112255/images/ride/TCM_Disney_Partnership.pdf|title=TCM Disney Partnership|publisher=Turner.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentaries===
In addition to films, Turner Classic Movies also airs original content, mostly [[documentary film|documentaries]] about classic movie personalities, the world of filmmaking and particularly notable films. An occasional month-long series, ''Race and Hollywood'', showcases films by and about people of non-white races, featuring discussions of how these pictures influenced white people's image of said races, as well as how people of those races viewed themselves. Previous installments have included "Asian Images on Film" in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/196827|0/Race-Hollywood-Asian-Images-in-Film-Tuesdays-Thursdays-in-June-.html Asian Images on Film], article on TCM website.&lt;/ref&gt; "Native American Images on Film" in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/296716|0/Race-Hollywood-Native-American-Images-On-Film.html Native American Images on Film], article on TCM website.&lt;/ref&gt; "Black Images on Film" in 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/movie-news.html?id=133365&amp;name=Race-Hollywood-Black-Images-on-Film Black Images On Film], article on TCM website.&lt;/ref&gt; "Latino Images on Film" in 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/240408/Latino-Images-in-Film-TCM-Original-Latin-Non-Latin.html Latino Images on Film], Hispanic actors talk about casting.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Arab Images on Film" in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/411149|0/Arab-Images-on-Film.html Arab Images on Film], article on TCM website.&lt;/ref&gt; The network aired the film series ''[[Screened Out]]'' (which explored the history and depiction of homosexuality in film) in 2007 and ''Religion on Film'' (focusing on the role of religion in cinematic works) in 2005. In 2011, TCM debuted a new series entitled ''[[AFI's Master Class: The Art of Collaboration]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|title=Steven Spielberg and John Williams tell stories by the score about ‘Jaws’ &amp; ‘E.T.’ in ‘AFI Master Class’|date=2011-11-14|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/steven-spielberg-john-williams-stories-score-jaws-amp-e-t-afi-master-class-article-1.977349#ixzz2Hyh7xTg2|author=David Hinckley }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/167227-afi-master-class-zemeckis-and-burgess-break-it-down/|work=[[PopMatters]]|title='AFI Master Class': Zemeckis and Burgess Break It Down|author=Maçek III, J.C.|date=2013-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TCM Remembers===
Most of the actors appearing in most TCM films are deceased. In December 1994, TCM debuted "TCM Remembers", a tribute to recently deceased notable film personalities (including actors, producers, composers, directors, writers and cinematographers) that occasionally airs during promotional breaks between films. The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer end-of-year compilation. Following the recent death of an especially famous classic film personality (usually an actor, producer, filmmaker or director), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased's work.

Every December, a longer, more inclusive "TCM Remembers" interstitial is produced that honors all of the noted film personalities who died during the past year, interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down and is being dismantled (2013). Since 2001, the soundtracks for these clipreels have been introspective melodies by [[Indie rock|indie]] artists and/or singer-songwriters such as [[Badly Drawn Boy]] (2007) or [[Steve Earle]] (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/mediaroom/video/282318/TCM-Remembers-2009-Movie-Promo-TCM-Original.html TCM Remembers 2009] at the TCM Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

TCM received a [[List of Peabody Award winners (2010–19)#2013|2013 Peabody Award]] for its presentation of [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]]' ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey]]'', a 15-episode documentary about the development and advancement of the medium of motion pictures. Drawing on its exhaustive film library, TCM complemented each episode with short films and feature films from the familiar to the little-seen.

==Turner Classic Movies HD==
Turner Classic Movies operates a [[high-definition television|high definition]] simulcast feed, with programs broadcast in HD presented in an upconverted [[1080i]] resolution format; the HD feed of the network was launched in June 2009. Initial programming was not available in native high definition and was instead upconverted from [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], but benefited from the greater bandwidth allocated to the channel. By November 2014, film masters meant for high definition presentation, along with Osborne and Mankiewicz-hosted continuity had transitioned to the format (though films meant to be presented in the [[Academy ratio]] or other [[anamorphic format]]s lower than 16:9 are presented as intended by the director or studio with the appropriate black boxing around the frame).

==Merchandising==

===TCM Vault Collection===
The '''TCM Vault Collection''' consists of several different [[DVD]] collections of rare classic films that have been licensed, remastered and released by Turner Classic Movies (through corporate sister [[Warner Home Video]]). These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or [[VHS]]. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the TCM library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).
* ''Universal Collection'' – Featuring films licensed by TCM from the [[Universal Studios]] vault.
* ''The Lost RKO Collection'' – Featuring RKO films from the 1930s.
* ''TCM Spotlight'' – A series of DVD boxsets released by Warner Home Video featuring [[Charlie Chan]] and stars such as [[Esther Williams]], [[Errol Flynn]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Deanna Durbin]], and [[Doris Day]].

In October 2015, TCM announced the launch of the TCM Wineclub, in which they teamed up with Laithwaite to provide a line of mail-order wines from famous vineyards such as famed writer-director-producer [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Ford Coppola's]] winery.  Wines are available in 3 month subscriptions, and can be selected as reds, whites, or a mixture of both.  From the wines chosen, TCM also includes recommended movies to watch with each, such as a "True Grit" wine, to be paired with the [[John Wayne]] film [[True Grit (1969 film)|of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Tcmwineclub.com|title=About TCM Wine Club|url=http://tcmwineclub.com/about-tcm-wine-club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International versions==
{{main|List of international Turner Classic Movies channels}}
Turner Classic Movies is available in many other countries around the world. In Canada, TCM began to be carried on [[Shaw Communications|Shaw Cable]] and satellite provider [[Shaw Direct]] in 2005. [[Rogers Cable]] started offering TCM in December 2006 as a [[free preview]] for subscribers of its [[digital cable]] tier, and was added to its analogue tier in February 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian feed is generally the same as that of the U.S. network, some films are replaced for broadcast in Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Other versions of TCM are available in [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[Nordic countries]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]] and [[Malta]]. The UK version operates two channels, including a spinoff called [[TCM 2]].

'''''Ultimate Beastmaster''''' is an American competition [[reality show]] that premiered on [[Netflix]] on February 24, 2017.

Reactions from all countries' hosts appear in each localized versions, especially during course clearing victories. Each season consists of 10 episodes, released simultaneously on Netflix worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/ultimate-beastmaster-netflix-competition-series-sylvester-stallone-dave-broome-1201769095/|title=Netflix Orders Global Competition Series 'Ultimate Beastmaster' from Sylvester Stallone, Dave Broome|last=Prudon|first=Laura|website=Variety|date=May 9, 2016|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first season premiered on February 24, 2017, while the second season aired on December 15, 2017.

==Premise==
In each episode, there are twelve contestants (2 from each country) who run a new obstacle course known as “The Beast”. The winner is crowned “Beastmaster”. Each of the "Beastmasters" from the nine Beastmaster episodes will go forward to a final course, to become the Ultimate Beastmaster.&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/netflix-ultimate-beastmaster-sylvester-stallone-competition-reality-series-1201751580/|title=Netflix Orders 'Ultimate Beastmaster' Competition Reality Series With Sylvester Stallone|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline|date=May 9, 2016|accessdate=October 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in Season 3, each show featured nine competitors (one from each country in the competition). The two competitors with the highest score in the final stage moved onto one of two semi-finals. The top three from each semi-final moved to the final episode to be crowned Ultimate Beastmaster.

Not only do each pair of hosts provide [[color commentary]] for each of the 6-9 localized versions, but the foreign commentators also make appearances in each localized version, with their commentary presented by subtitles. If a contestant completes a course, all hosts' reactions are shown on screen. Furthermore, since all host booths are placed in a row on the ''Ultimate Beastmaster'' set, commentators from one localization can easily walk over into the booth of another localized version.

==Reception==
James Hibberd compares the first season of ''Ultimate Beastmaster'' to ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' in a mixed review of the shows. Hibberd praises ''Ultimate Beastmaster''{{'}}s "gorgeous superstructure" of a course, the international rivalry aspect and concise contestant profile clips, but criticizes the show's commentators and the repetitiveness of the course, the latter of which ''American Ninja Warrior'' avoids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/02/ultimate-beastmaster-review/|title=''Ultimate Beastmaster'' vs. ''Ninja Warrior'': An honest comparison|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=March 2, 2017|accessdate=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Yo soy Betty, la fea''''' ("I am Betty, the Ugly one") is a [[telenovela]] filmed in Colombia, written by [[Fernando Gaitán]] and was produced from 25 October 1999 to 8 May 2001 by the Colombian network [[RCN TV|RCN (Radio Cadena Nacional)]]. More than a dozen versions of the telenovela have been made in other countries due to the popularity of the plot.  In the United States, both the comedy-drama hit ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' and [[Televisa]] program ''[[La Fea Más Bella]]'' are based on the Colombian soap opera.

'''Betty, la Fea''' re-aired on Spanish-language U.S. network [[TeleFutura]] in January 2009. Eight years after the telenovela's original run, the highly anticipated return of the original version of ''Yo Soy Betty, La Fea'' delivered impressive ratings for the network, attracting over one million viewers, more than half a million of which were adults aged 18–49. In addition, the premiere episode doubled and in some cases nearly tripled its prior audience among all key demographics.

Due to the success of re-runs aired in the United States, in June 2009, ''Yo soy Betty, la fea'' re-aired in [[México]] on [[Canal de las Estrellas]].

''Betty, la fea'' is one of the world's most popular television shows and is considered the most famous Latin telenovela in history.  It is the first telenovela to have been remade worldwide and has been regarded as bringing the telenovela to new levels of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3662430/Telenovelas-the-story-so-far.html|title=Telenovelas: the story so far|first=Alex|last=Bellos|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Taking place principally in Bogotá, Colombia, ''Betty La Fea'' is essentially a Cinderella comedy about the rise of poor, ugly Betty Pinzón and the fall of rich, handsome Armando Mendoza. Armando is a very incompetent playboy with a scheme to turn a huge profit as the new president of Eco Moda, a clothing manufacturing company. But his scheme is doomed for his faulty mathematics.  Because Betty, his secretary (and economics wizard), is enamored with him, she helps Armando deceive the board of directors as he loses money and brings the company to ruin. The story has three movements: 1) Armando's foolish destruction of Eco Moda, 2) Betty's flight from the disgrace and her vacation in Cartagena where she is transformed to a beauty, and 3) Betty returned to Eco Moda, installed as new president. The structure is much like a classical symphony in three movements.  The first is sonata-allegro, acted out with very fast velocity: the two themes being 1) the irrational idiocy of Armando vs the calm rationality of Betty while she fantasizes romance with Armando in her mind. The second is a slow short movement with much time spent showing parades and the like in Cartagena counterpoised vs. the degradation of disgraced Armando back in Bogotá, while Betty undergoes a transformation from ugly to beautiful.  The third is the stabilization of Eco Moda under Betty's presidency ending with the marriage of Betty and Armando with the birth of their baby.

Beatriz Aurora Pinzón Solano, (Betty), is an ugly but brilliant economist working as a secretary at a Colombian fashion empire, EcoModa. Betty constantly faces the scorn of Eco Moda's attractive manager-owners but proves herself indispensable to Eco Moda's new president, Armando Mendoza. She becomes Armando's accomplice in a clandestine scheme to save Eco Moda from financial ruin, part of which scheme is that Armando should seduce Betty while engaged to Marcela, an executive and stock holder of the company.  But while Armando proceeds cynically to seduce a woman who is physically repugnant to him (Betty), he becomes enamored of him, and they fornicate.

Though Betty has a master's degree in finance and graduated at the top of her class, she has always been unable to secure a job interview, because, she claims, her ugly photograph ruins her otherwise impressive résumé. After searching unsuccessfully for a job to match her education and experience, she applies for a position as the secretary to the president of Eco Moda, a highly successful, trendy fashion manufacturer/retailer founded by two families, the Mendozas and the Valencias. She sends her résumé to Eco Moda without a photograph, thus securing an interview.

Armando Mendoza, who is  Eco Moda's new president, is the handsome and stupid (though supposedly educated) son of the company's retiring co-founder Roberto Mendoza.  He is engaged to Marcela Valencia (because he needs her vote to be president).  Marcela is an Eco Moda executive and daughter of the deceased co-founder, Señor Valencia. Armando is in search of a new secretary and interviews both Betty and Marcela's best friend, named Patricia Fernández for the same position.  He is reluctant to hire Patricia because he knows that Marcela wants her there to spy on him, given his reputation as a womanizer. Armando then interviews Betty. While he notices her "ugliness", he likes the idea that she is well-educated in economics. In order to please Marcela, Armando decides to hire as his new secretaries both Betty, the ugly but brilliant economist, and the very attractive but air-headed Patricia.

Since Eco Moda is a fashion company that is primarily concerned with image and beauty, Patricia is seated in the lobby while Betty is seated in a large storage closet located in Armando's office, to not be shown to the public. Nevertheless, Betty continues to prove herself invaluable as she maneuvers effortlessly in the business and finance milieu, earning respect among industry insiders and the secretaries who would become her close friends, lately called ''El cuartel de las feas'' (The club of the ugly women). Betty is almost immediately enamored of love with Armando, but keeps her feelings a secret as she fantasizes about a relationship with him. She is thrilled to hear Armando say something like, "You are the woman that I need".

Along the way, Eco Moda falls from Armando's incompetent schemes that cause the company to lose millions of dollars, therefore putting the company into financial ruin. Out of loyalty, and love, to Armando, she helps him launch a new business in her name, which can lend money to Eco Modo and then put an embargo on the company to prevent it's creditors from foreclosing it and seizing it if Eco Modo fails. The business plan sets up a legal company named Terra Moda, legally owned by Betty. Terra Moda prevents the banks from taking over Eco Moda, because Terra Moda forecloses on Eco Modo before the other creditors. Once the summer fashion line is released, Eco Moda will be secure in their finances, and Terra Moda can be dissolved. However, Armando asks Betty for the second time to cook the books of the company in order to deceive the board by hiding it's ruined status, so he may remain in the presidency. Betty reluctantly agrees to help him with this fraud and asks her best friend, Nicolas Mora, to go along with it. Eco Moda's vice president (and Armando's best friend) Mario Calderon is the only other person at the company who knows about the business plan. However, because of how the plan works, Eco Moda has been taken over by legal process by Terra Moda, setting up Betty as the virtual owner. Mario is concerned that Betty plans to keep the company to herself after they suspect she is involved in a romantic relationship with her best friend (Nicolas Mora). He convinces Armando to make her fall in love with him for security. Armando is sure that Betty could never be so devious, but after hearing rumors about the supposedly relationship between Betty and Nicolas, he begins to worry that they will stay with the company and all its fortune. He takes Mario's advice and starts to seduce Betty, even though he is disgusted by the idea. Once the company is back in Armando's hands, he will break up with Betty and fire her.

As the weeks pass by, Betty falls more in love with Armando. In turn, Armando starts seeing past the "ugliness" and looks at the beautiful person that Betty is inside. He genuinely begins to fall in love with her, but keeps his feelings a secret from Mario, who constantly teases him about having to kiss the ugly girl. A couple of days before the budget meeting, Betty discovers a letter from Mario to Armando in a blue gift bag, describing details about the deception that is all disguised with chocolates and other  things included in the bag. When the bag accidentally falls into her hands, the very curious Betty accidentally discovers the plan and learns of the deception. Not knowing all to react, Betty falls into a deep depression and silently cries in agony. A heart broken Betty is then discovered by a Beauty Pageant Cecilia Bolocco(who plays as herself), and tries to care for her. She is refused by Betty's sudden hate and envy for beautiful women. After insisting on helping her, Betty opens up and the two of them have a heart to heart conversation. After Cecilia leaves, Betty begins to have hope that the deception is nothing more than a joke after remembering the wonderful moments that she had with Armando. She then makes photocopies of the letter, and asks the secretaries to return the gift bag as if it was never found.

When Armando receives a call from Mario, and he retrieves the gift bag, it is confirmed that the deception is indeed not a joke, and Betty wails silently in agony. She is devastated at how Armando could be so cruel and play with her feelings, but first decides to resign from Eco-Moda, but after a lot of thinking, she decides to play along with Armando's game. Betty first makes Armando believe she is losing feelings for him and falling in love with her childhood friend Nicholas. She begins to torment Armando by spending Eco Moda's money on a luxury car and fancy restaurants and then by spending more time with Nicholas, thus making Armando furiously jealous. After a few days of torment, tears, and fist fights (Nicholas and Armando), Betty realizes she is only making her pain worse by playing along with the game and decides to end it.

She exposes the truth of the secret business plan to his family at the meeting by presenting the real balance sheet and not the fake one. At that moment, Armando and Mario realize that she has known about their vicious plan the entire time. The families (who are also stockholders) are informed that Eco Moda is in financial ruin and that Betty is its new owner. However, Betty reveals that Terra Moda was only set up to prevent Eco Moda from going bankrupt and that she is handing back full ownership to the stockholders. Roberto Mendoza chastises Betty on her involvement in such a scheme, knowing her to be an honest woman, and she is banned from the building. Before she leaves, Armando confronts her, only to find out how much Betty was humiliated by his deception. He tries to confess his now true feelings for her, but she refuses to listen. As Betty leaves the building, Marcela suspects her as a thief and demands to know what she is hiding inside a black trash bag where she has been keeping all the fake love letters and gifts. Betty has no choice but to reveal the affair between her and Armando. Marcela is devastated and shocked but was told by Betty that their relationship was nothing more than a cruel plan to make sure she doesn't get away with the company. Marcela cancels the wedding and breaks up with Armando. Everyone, including his family, disowns him.

Hurt and heartbroken, Betty immediately takes a job as the assistant to a fashion icon who is in charge of the Miss Colombia Pageant. She runs to the airport to catch a flight to Cartagena. She decides to confide the whole truth to her new boss, Catalina Angel, who has also been her guardian angel and close friend throughout her hard times in Eco Moda.

Armando is desperate to find Betty, but cannot. He must also deal with the fallout of the business situation Eco Moda is now in. Armando is fired and his father comes out of retirement to take over the presidential duties. The attorney realizes that Betty did not correctly turn over the business back to the stockholders, therefore Betty and Terra Moda are still the rightful owners of the company, thus preventing the bank from seizing control. Knowing that the only way to save the company is to continue with the "business plan" until after the summer fashion line, the stockholders have no choice but to beg Betty to come back and run the company. The only problem is that they can't find her.

Meanwhile, Betty is surrounded by all the beautiful pageant ladies and has become fast friends with a gorgeous French photographer (Michel) who would later find interest in her. Catalina helps Betty come out of her shell and slowly helps Betty shed some of her ugliness. First she convinces Betty to accept an advance on her salary so that she can buy clothes that complement her figure better. The next day she takes Betty to a hair stylist and asks them to give her a more modern cut. A few days later she is taken back to the hair stylist to have her unibrow and stache waxed out and she is fixed with make up. Catalina "accidentally" breaks her nerdy glasses and the new pair is much more suited to her face. It seems that Betty has shed her ugliness overnight and looks quite beautiful. But then gets a call from her father saying that she needs to return to finish some business with EcoModa. Reluctantly, she returns home after finishing her work in Cartagena.

When she walks into Eco Moda, nobody recognizes her. Everyone is quite shocked at her transformation, for example Patricia passing rumors to Marcela ("Marcela! I hate her! She spent Eco Moda's money in facial surgery!"). Thinking that Betty is still spending the company's money after purchasing a Mercedes-Benz (which is the luxury car like the one Patricia had, before it was repossessed and towed away from Patricia), and for the fancy restaurants. Roberto tells Betty about the critical financial situation they are in and asks Betty to help him save the company from going bankrupt. Although hesitant about working at Eco Moda once again, Betty agrees, feeling some unfortunate responsibility as to why they are in that situation. She is to be the new president of Eco Moda until the company can be financially stable again.

Months later, the new fashion line is a great success thanks to Betty's business savvy and her idea of modeling her friends (the club of the ugly women) instead of the usual, beautiful models. Although Betty appears to be dating Michel, who came to visit her from Cartagena, she is still in love with Armando but does not believe him at all when he confesses his feelings for her. Michel offers Betty to move to Cartagena with her family to work for a chain of restaurants and start a new life once she finishes her job in EcoModa. She is unsure whether to take the offer at first, but later accepts it.

Betty tells her friends she is leaving Bogotá and they are all devastated by the news. In fact, she decides to leave earlier than planned in order to forget Armando forever, and by making the club of ugly women photocopy, then  hand  out a letter to every member of the Board Of Directors, about her resignation from Eco Moda. This puts the company back in danger because it is not yet stable. In order to prevent this, Armando decides to move far away so that Betty can stay and continue as president, without him (considered a nuisance) around. Betty's friends try convincing her to stay, truly believing that Armando has changed, but she refuses to stay and give him a chance. This means that the presidential role would go to Daniel Valencia, another executive and stockholder, who is also Marcela's brother, and Betty and Armando's rude enemy. He would sell the company and save whatever is left of it, therefore causing hundreds of people to be unemployed. When Marcela hears about this, she decides to swallow her pride and resentment and tells Betty the truth about everything that happened when she left for Cartagena, when she talked to Margarita (Armando's mother), and convinced her to not support Daniel as the new president, for fear of liquidating the company. Because of this, Betty realizes that Armando is truly a changed man, and she stops him from leaving. They both stay and run the company together and after a few months, the two eventually marry. But Armando never recovers his leadership role over Eco Moda. 

The final scene shows everyone staring at Betty and Armando's new-born daughter, who possibly resembles Betty when she was first born.

===''El amor no es como lo pintan''===
(Love is not as it looks) (2000, [[Azteca Trece|Azteca 13]], Mexico): Vanessa Acosta as Alicia "Licha" Ramírez Campos. ''[[El amor no es como lo pintan]]'' concluded in 2001.

===''Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin''===
(There's No One Like Jassi) (2003, [[Sony Entertainment Television (India)|SET]], India): [[Mona Singh]] as Jasmeet Walia. The Indian version is not so much about beauty and ugliness, as about a simple middle class girl with strong family values being catapulted into the amoral world of high fashion upper society, although Jassi was made to appear ugly by having on thick rimmed glasses, braces and an unsightly hairstyle. ''[[Jassi Jaissi Koi Nahin]]'' concluded in 2006.

===''Sensiz Olmuyor''===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Turkey's "[[Sensiz Olmuyor]]" (Won't Work Without You) told the story of Gönül and Arda on two separate TV networks, with each channel showing thirteen episodes. When the weekly series debuted on Show TV in January 2005, Özlem Conker played Gönül (which means 'heart' in Turkish), the intelligent swan in ugly duckling clothing, and pop star Emre Altuğ appeared as her boss and love interest, Arda. The show did not go on hiatus when it was moved from Show TV to rival network Kanal D, but there was one big change: Yeliz Şar took over the role of Gönül, but the rest of the original cast remained intact.

===''Verliebt in Berlin''===
In February 2005, the German TV network, [[SAT 1]], began airing a version called ''[[Verliebt in Berlin]]'' (The title is a word-play and can mean either ''In Love in Berlin'' or ''In Love with Berlin''), starring local soap opera star [[Alexandra Neldel]] as Lisa Plenske and Swiss actor [[Mathis Künzler]] as David. The show had 5 million viewers daily and was extended beyond its initial 250 episode run in early 2006.

A few weeks later it was announced that the show would be renewed for a second season, but without Neldel and Künzler. The focus shifted onto a male lead character named Bruno Plenske (Lisa's half-brother, played by [[Tim Sander]]). Without Alexandra Neldel, however, the show lost much of its original appeal and dwindling ratings led to its cancellation in 2007. ''Verliebt in Berlin'' has also been broadcast in dubbed versions in Hungary (as ''Lisa csak egy van'') and France (as ''Le destin de Lisa''). Although ''Verliebt in Berlin'' continued with new featured characters and original [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]], it is still credited as "based on ''Yo Soy Betty La Fea''".

===''Ne Rodis' Krasivoy''===
{{Main|Not Born Beautiful}}
(''Be Not Born Beautiful'', from the Russian phrase, "be not born beautiful, but be born happy", "Ne Rodis' Krasivoy, Rodis' Shchastlivoy")

===''Yo Soy Bea''===
Despite the original Colombian production already being in Spanish, [[Telecinco]] launched an adaptation in Spain called ''Yo soy Bea'' in July 2006.  The Spanish version title (which translates to "I am Bea") is a pun, with "Bea" sounding like both ''fea'' ("ugly") and ''bella'' ("beautiful"), and being the short version of the protagonist name, ''Beatriz''.  [http://www.ellaesruth.com Ruth Núñez] played Beatriz Pérez Pinzón and [[Alejandro Tous]] was Álvaro Aguilar, the company boss.

The Spanish adaptation screens weekdays at 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm and pulls in an average of more than four million viewers (more than +35% share of the audience). The series' record is a 42,1% of share. It has become Spain's top-rated daytime programme. Ruth Núñez, known to Spanish viewers for her portrayal of a Yugoslav student in teen soap, ''[[Compañeros]]'', plays the heroine.

In this version, Beatriz Pérez Pinzón (Núñez) is an unattractive 26-year-old economist whose looks aren't important to her. She's intelligent and kind, and one day, after having cared for her widower father for two years, she decides to look for a job. Although she's very well educated, she gets only a secretary job at the magazine "Bulevar 21". She becomes the secretary of Álvaro Aguilar (Alejandro Tous), the company boss. In the company, Bea will be against Cayetana ([[Mónica Estarreado]]), Álvaro's fiancée, and her friend Bárbara ([[Norma Ruiz]]), who is also Álvaro's secretary.
The Spanish Version won a [[TP de Oro]] to "La mejor telenovela" in 2007.

===''Ugly Betty''===
{{Main|Ugly Betty}}
The American production was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the United States from 28 September 2006 to 14 April 2010.

In 2004, actress [[Salma Hayek]]'s production company, [[Ventanarosa]], in a joint venture with [[Reveille Productions]] and [[ABC Television Studio]] bought the rights to ''Betty la fea'', converting it to an English-language [[seriocomedy]] series. ABC would acquire the series under the title ''Ugly Betty'', and initially slated the program for broadcasting in summer of 2006 as a daily series, but its success led to ABC slating it as a weekly series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6327126.html?display=Breaking+News&amp;referral=SUPP&amp;nid=2228 |title="ABC Rethinks Ugly Betty" from "Broadcasting &amp; Cable" (23 April 2006) |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hour-long program aired Fridays at 9:00&amp;nbsp;pm (Eastern time);&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc.go.com/shows/ugly-betty/index From "Ugly Betty – ABC.com" (3 December 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; the first episode was broadcast 28 September 2006.

===''Maria, i Aschimi''===
[[Mega Channel]] in Greece is airing its own version titled ''[[Maria, i Aschimi]]'' (''Μαρία, Η Άσχημη'' – ''Maria, The Ugly One'')
starring [[Aggeliki Daliani]] and [[Anthimos Ananiadis]] . Maria exudes intelligence, humor, and kindness, but what she is missing is conventional beauty. She considers her appearance to be an obstacle in her search for employment, despite her collection of degrees, which are displayed proudly by her parents, Kaiti and Irakles. Having no luck in her job search, Maria decides to try for a job for which she is overqualified, secretary to Alexis Mantas, the director of a noted fashion house called Ecomoda. Alexis is the most coveted bachelor in [[Athens]], but he has recently gotten engaged to Markella, who tries to get him to choose her best friend, Lilian, to be his secretary and to keep an eye on him. Lilian doesn't have Maria's natural intelligence or fine education, but she has a beautiful appearance, which makes her a better superficial fit at the fashion house.

This adaptation was originally supposed to start airing on 1 November 2006, but within two weeks of that date the show was removed from Mega Channel's schedule. Finally, it began on 1 January 2007 at 21:00 and although it was scheduled to move at 18:15 two weeks later, due to its high ratings (± 45% according to Agb Hellas and more than 2 million viewers) finally remained in the prime-time slot of the channel.

===''Gogona Gareubnidan''===
Georgia's version of the Betty story began on 24 May 2010, about one month after the U.S.A.'s ''[[Ugly Betty]]'' ended. The first episode was a pretty faithful remake of the pilot episode for ''Ugly Betty'', with only minor changes, making this the first series to be adapted directly from the American ''Ugly Betty'' and not the Colombian ''Yo soy Betty, la fea''. The series stars Tina Makharadze as Tamuna and takes place in [[Tbilisi]], the Georgian capital (Tamuna lives in the outskirts, hence the show's title, which translates as "Girl from the Suburbs"). The first season consisted of 10 episodes and concluded on 26 July 2010. The second ran from 8 October 2010 through 31 December 2010, and consisted of 13 episodes. The second season diverged even farther from the story lines of ''Ugly Betty'' than the first season had, but many details within various episodes were directly or loosely based on details from second, third, and fourth season episodes of ''Ugly Betty''. The third season began on 11 February 2011 without the show's leading man, Tornike Gogrichiani, who played Tamuna's boss, Nika Kekelidze. Gogrichiani was absent from the season's first four episodes and it was rumored online that he may be leaving the series altogether.

A '''Zarya Antenna''' is a special type of directional mediumwave broadcasting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] consisting of a long straight row of grounded [[lattice tower]]s with a height of approximately 50 metres in a distance of 100 metres. These towers carry the antenna wire.

Three types of Zarya antennas are used at most larger AM broadcasting facilities in the former Soviet Union. They use the same configuration but different length values, which are 1500, 2500 and 3500 metres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11769">[[File:ZissBenz1911.jpg|thumb|250px|Ziss-Modell were models made near Düsseldorf. Bodies were diecast metal with plastic parts. Sometimes parts came in special illustrated packages to be assembled like the ornate roof racks on this Benz. The box portrays the model provided. R. W. Modell boxes were the same design, but red.]]
'''Ziss-Modell,''' originally also called '''R. W. Modell''' or '''Wittek Modell''' were 'brand' names of the German '''Mini-Auto''' firm which made diecast metal classic and contemporary vehicles from the 1960s through the late 1970s. Later, use of the Mini-Auto name largely disappeared and the models were mainly known as Ziss or R. W. Modell. The company was based in Lintorf.

==Complex name history==
The company began sometime in the 1960s as the Mini-Auto Company with models called R.W. Modell - possibly for the founder E. (probably Erich) Wittek or another relative of the same family - brand nomenclature in early pamphlets is unclear. The Mini-Auto name appeared occasionally on packaging and the bases of models, but it usually appeared only in brochures (Johnson 1998, p. 254; Wittek No date). Later, about the mid-1970s, use of the name Mini-Auto disappeared in favor of only R. W. Modell or Ziss. This may have been due to confusion with other names of miniature manufacturers like Italy's Dugu Miniautotoys, the Miniauto line produced by Kaden in Czechoslovakia, or Dave Sinclair's Mini-Auto import and sales shop in Erie, Pennsylvania. 

Finally, R. W. Modell seems to have been changed to Ziss which may have also been a family name (some web sites say E. Wittek's son continued the operation, thus the gradual name change from R. W. to Ziss; see Robinson 2010). For a time, however, the two names were used simultaneously under the Mini-Auto or Wittek Modell appellation and some company brochures show both 'brands' on their covers. There appears to have been no specific model differentiation between the two lines. The influential U.S. importer David Sinclair, who scoured Europe for new models and got to know many of the individuals behind the companies, called the company a "comparatively small family operation" (Sinclair 1979, p. 392).

The company, whichever name is used, was located in Lintorf, West Germany, a town near Ratingen, north of Düsseldorf and not far from the Rhine River (Wittek No date; Rixon 2005, p. 72). R. W. and Ziss boxes commonly say "Made in Western-Germany" on the flaps. The company made both contemporary and veteran vehicles. That a German manufacturer would carry models from two distinct decades seems a rare treat - French companies like [[Minialuxe]], [[RAMI by J.M.K.]] or Italian [[Rio Models]] and [[Brumm]] were ahead of any German firm in making veteran vehicles from before 1930. Except for [[Cursor Models]] which were made for the Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, and some [[Gama Toys|Gama]] veteran cars, Ziss seems to be the only German manufacturer dedicated to making an array of models from the veteran era (Gibson 1971, p. 21).

==Veteran Line==
[[File:ZissAudiAlpensieger.jpg|thumb|250px|Ziss-Modell / Euro-Modell no. 60 1913 Audi Alpensieger (Alps winner) with boat-tail design. This is a "Euro-Modell", with the Ziss name blotted out from the metal base. The same model number is used as that applied in the original Ziss line-up.]]
The earliest models were a classic line of mostly German vehicles in the spirit of French [[RAMI by J.M.K.]] or Italian [[Rio Models]] (Gibson 1971, pp. 20-21). Both autos and trucks were produced, usually in three or four different colors for each model. Under the earlier R.W. name, models included the cute little 1920s Hanomag "Kommisbrot" ("bread loaf" - in top up and top down versions, like Rio and Brumm models), a 1905 Mercedes Kettenwagen, coupe and Grand Prix, a BMW Dixi, and a FIAT 508S Balilla coupe. 

Under the Ziss Modell name, new marques such as Adler, Mercedes-Simplex, Audi Alpensieger, Opel, and N.A.G. appeared. New trucks appeared as well like Henschel, M.A.N. and B.V. tankers. These trucks were heavy with an unusually high metal content (Rixon 2005, p. 73). Some of the models, like selected Henschel trucks, appeared as special promotionals in distinct white boxes. Even a couple of Ford Model Ts, including a utility "Ranch-wagen", were made, similar to choices that the French [[RAMI by J.M.K.]] had done. It is interesting that none of the R. W. models appear to have leaked over into the Ziss line-up, showing somewhat of a break in development of models between R. W. and Ziss Modell - but about 1970 or so, both were offered simultaneously, and there appears no specific rationale for the two lines, other than a gradual name change. For Ziss at least two significantly different versions from each marque appeared, such as an Opel Stadtcoupe and an Opel Torpedo or the Adler phaeton and the Adler limousine.

==Contemporary offerings==
Though Ziss-Modell is more known for its classic line, like the French [[Minialuxe]] it also offered a few contemporary cars and trucks. From the outset, R. W. Modell made a Ford Transit van, contemporary German Hanomag stake and delivery trucks in both shorter wheelbase and longer articulated forms, a Volkswagen transporter flatbed, a tractor and a Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman limousine. A simply cast Jeep was also available. 

Later Ziss offerings included an Opel Rekord II four door sedan from about 1972 with opening front doors, and a two-door Opel Commodore (Bickford 2009). An Opel Manta is mentioned by some, but the existence of this model has not been confirmed. The rather arbitrary nature of the contemporary offerings makes one wonder if they were offered mainly because of promotional contracts with Opel or Mercedes-Benz. Why not other Porsches, Audis, Volkswagens, BMWs or Mercedes-Benzes? Because Schabak had Audi and Cursor had Volkswagen and other companies covered Mercedes-Benz? Ziss models also appear to have been for special purposes.

==Promotional models==

Besides the normal liveries appearing on the sides of some trucks, Ziss did some models which were promotionals for specific companies. Ziss made a rather simple diecast Jeep and one version was a marketing promotional for Wicküler beer - complete with '3 Musketeers'-like figures holding up beer steins. The Ford Transit van was offered with Funny Frisch chips logo on the sides. Various liveries appeared on the M.A.N. and Henschel trucks including British Petroleum, Aral Oil, Wicküler beer, and Schenker transport. One M.A.N. omnibus was for the Wiblingen-Ulm-Wiblingen circuit to the famed cathedral. 

Ziss also made a few construction vehicles which were apparently used for company promotion. One example was a Clark C-500 540D forklift made in a gray-green in 1/24 scale and also a pair of O&amp;K excavator-loaders in both wheeled and tracked versions. Also offered was a yellow P&amp;H excavator loader, which appeared very similar to the O&amp;K machines. A couple of tractors - an orange and gray Fiat 550, and a Deutz Series 06 were also offered in bright card boxes with photos of the tractors on the sides.
==Packaging==
It seems earlier boxes were blue and labeled with the Mini-Auto name along with Wittek Modell, but this design is rare. Some R.W. Modell vehicles had red boxes with plastic windows with no illustration of the vehicle. These boxes were in German script with brief vehicle specifications. Other R.W. boxes had red and white vertical stripes on two sides with solid red on the alternate sides - with an illustration of the vehicle. Ziss Modell boxes were blue, yet decorated in the same manner as the earlier R.W. boxes. 

Vehicles sometimes came with railings or other parts in packages with illustrations on how to affix the parts to the model. This is the case with the 1911 Benz Landaulet which came with separate, ornately curved, diecast zamac roof racks. Some of the R.W. Hanomag truck boxes were multicolored, but the striped boxes described above were most common. Some of the last vehicles in the late 1970s or possibly the early 1980s were sold in plastic display boxes.

==Execution and detail==

The model selection of mainly German marques in the R.W. and Ziss line-up earns kudos, especially some in the R.W. Modell line like the Hanomag "Kommissbrot". This model was ultra detailed with fine features like lights, horn, opening rear engine lid, tilting seats and a spare tire behind the seats. Still, the execution and detail of some models lacked confidence. Ziss models often have a cheap looking plastic 'wooden spoke' wheel style that doesn't even look as good as Matchbox Models of Yesteryear's metal wheels. Later models offered a more realistic plastic wire wheel design. 

Color choice was sometimes criticized as was the rendition of Ziss lamps, grilles and other finer pieces of the models, which Gibson called "uncomfortable" (Gibson 1971, pp. 28-29). Another uncomfortable feature was the raised ribs for door joints on some models like the Audi Alpensieger - a ridge to give the impression of the door line is unfortunate though the same practice is also seen on [[Spot-On]] models. Still, no other diecast company before or since has offered such classic German selections. They are done well, some of them very well and are reasonably priced on the normal auction sites.

==Demise of Ziss==
Most sources say the company stopped producing about 1978 (Sinclair 1979, p. 392). Some models may have been produced into the early 1980s. Previous Ziss models appeared in the early 1980s modeled as '''Euro-Modell'''. These often blotted the molded Ziss name from the metal base of the model, but some Euro-Modell's bases still said Ziss. Whether it was Ziss with ''another'' new name or a completely different company is uncertain, but some reported that models such as the Audi Alpenseiger were sold as promotional models in contemporary Audi dealers. It is uncertain if this 'Euro-Modell' (hyphenated) was related to the more contemporary 'Euro Modell' HO (1:87 scale) plastic model producer.
