'''4,4’-Dinitro-3,3’-diazenofuroxan''' ('''DDF''') is a powerful experimental [[high explosive]] with performance comparable to that of other high-density high-explosives such as [[octanitrocubane]]. It is synthesised by oxidative coupling
of 4-amino-3-(azidocarbonyl)[[furoxan]] followed by Curtius rearrangement and further oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;Blinnikov AN, Kulikov AS, Makhova NN, Ovchinnikov IV, Pivina TS. 4-Amino-3-azidocarbonyl Furoxan as an Universal Synthon for the Synthesis of Energetic Compounds of the Furoxan Series.

In [[telecommunications]] an '''aerial insert''' is a segment of [[Telephone cable|cabling]] that rises from ground to a point above ground, followed by an overhead run, e.g. on poles, followed by a drop back into the ground. An aerial insert is used in places where it is not possible or practical to place a cable underground. Aerial inserts might be encountered in crossing deep [[ditch]]es, [[canal]]s, [[river]]s, or [[Subway (rail)|subway lines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/other/a.pdf Federal Standard 1037C]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antipasto''' (plural '''antipasti''') is the traditional first course of a formal [[Meal structure in Italy|Italian meal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/antipasto|title=Definition of ANTIPASTO|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical ingredients of a traditional antipasto include [[cured meat]]s, [[olive]]s, [[peperoncini]], [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]], [[Anchovy|anchovies]], [[artichoke]] hearts, various [[cheese]]s (such as [[provolone]] or [[mozzarella]]), pickled meats, and vegetables in oil or vinegar.

The contents of an antipasto vary greatly according to regional cuisine. It is quite possible to find different preparations of saltwater fish and traditional southern cured meats (like [[soppressata]] or [['nduja]]) in the [[southern Italy|south of Italy]], whereas in [[northern Italy]] it will contain different kinds of cured meats and mushrooms and, especially near lakes, preparations of [[freshwater fish]]. The cheeses included also vary significantly between regions and backgrounds, and include hard and soft cheeses.

Many compare antipasto to [[hors d'oeuvre]], but antipasto is served at the table and signifies the official beginning of the [[Italy|Italian]] meal. It may also be referred to as a starter, or an [[appetizer]].

'''Apollo Diamond Inc.''' was a company based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] that was able to produce nearly flawless single [[crystal]] [[diamond]] wafers and crystals for potential use in the [[optoelectronics]], [[nanotechnology]], and consumer [[gemstone|gem]] markets. The company used [[Chemical vapor deposition of diamond|chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) for the production of their gem-sized [[synthetic diamond]] crystals, and obtained several U.S. [[patent]]s on the process. The company's techniques were able to produce [[color]]less gems, in contrast to previous diamond-making techniques which usually produced colored diamonds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/maney/2005-05-31-nanotech_x.htm Nanotechnology's everywhere], ''USA today''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, many assets of Apollo Diamond were acquired by [[Scio Diamond Technology Corporation]], which said it would use the technology at its South Carolina facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jckonline.com/2011/09/27/new-company-plans-to-produce-synthetic-diamonds New Company Plans to Produce Synthetic Diamonds]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10025">The '''Baku–Batumi pipeline''' is the name given to several [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and pipeline projects to transport [[kerosene]] and [[crude oil]] from the [[Caspian region]] to the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] [[Batumi]] oil terminal at the [[Black Sea]]. When first constructed in 1906, it was the world's longest kerosene pipeline.&lt;ref name=transnefteprodukt/&gt;

==Kerosene pipeline==
Together with oil developments in the Baku area, the need for construction of the oil pipeline from Baku to the Black Sea rose. The first pipeline proposal was submitted by Russian engineer I. Ilimov already in 1878.&lt;ref name=transnefteprodukt&gt;

}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] proposed the construction of Baku–Batum pipeline to ensure the transportation of Baku oil to the world market.&lt;ref name=az&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1884, the chief engineer [[Vladimir Shukhov]] of Bari engineering company published a scientifically based draft and estimate of the Baku – Batum oil pipeline. Also the pipeline technical project was later designed by Vladimir Shukhov. In 1885, mining engineer I. Ilimov established the Caspian and Black Sea Oil Pipeline company. In December 1887, the Government of Russia granted to Ilimov the concession to establish the Society of the Caspian-Black Sea Oil Pipeline, a [[joint stock company]]. However, in 1891 the pipeline construction was postponed as premature, and the construction started only in 1896. At the first stage, the Batum-Mikhailovo (Khashuri) section was constructed, while the construction of Baku-Mikhailovo (Khashuri) section was finished only in 1906 [ref.11].&lt;ref name=transneft1&gt;

The first pipeline was kerosene pipeline with total length of {{convert|835|km|mi}} and 16&amp;nbsp;pumping stations.  The diameter of the pipeline was mainly {{convert|8|in|mm|-1}}, but some parts had diameter of {{convert|10|in|mm|-1}} and {{convert|12|in|mm|-1}}.&lt;ref name=transneft1/&gt;  The pipes were produced at plants in [[Mariupol]], Sosnovtsa and Yekaterinoslav (now [[Dnipro]]).&lt;ref name=transnefteprodukt/&gt;  The pipeline was built along the railroad line and the telephone communication was arranged along the route.  The initial pipeline capacity was 980,000&amp;nbsp;tons of kerosene per annum. Pumping stations were equipped with plunger pumps, driven by steam and [[diesel engine]]s.&lt;ref name=transneft1/&gt; The pipeline for its time was the longest pipeline in the world.&lt;ref name=transnefteprodukt/&gt;

After the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik Revolution]], kerosene deliveries through the pipeline were relaunched in March 1921 and on 20 May 1921, the first delivery of kerosene arrived at Batum. After 1936 Batum was renamed to Batumi [ref.11].&lt;ref name=transneft2&gt;

==Crude oil pipeline==
The project of new pipeline was proposed in 1924. In 1925, the [[Soviet Union]] held negotiations with French companies to set up a joint venture to construct and operate the Baku-Batum crude oil pipeline. The intention was to use the pipeline for oil export to Europe, mainly to [[France]]. However, the negotiations failed as also failed negotiations with the United States companies. In 1927, the construction of the pipeline was awarded to Azneft, an [[Oil industry in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani]] oil company. The project designer and construction manager was A.V. Bulgakov.&lt;ref name=lukoil1/&gt;

The construction started  in May 1928 and the pipeline was opened on 30 April 1930. It supplied mainly Batum's refinery.&lt;ref name=lukoil1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crude oil pipeline had a diameter of {{convert|10|in|mm|-1}} and the length was {{convert|834|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=transneft2/&gt; The pipeline had 13 pumping stations each equipped with three diesel pumps of 360&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]]. The pipeline used over 60,000&amp;nbsp;German-manufactured pipes weighing a total of over 54,000&amp;nbsp;tons. Diesels for the pipeline were purchased from [[MAN SE|MAN AG]], pumps from [[Crossley]] and generators from [[Theodor Bergmann]].&lt;ref name=lukoil1/&gt;
Construction work was done on three sections simultaneously. The highest point was at the {{convert|823|m|ft}} above of [[sea level]]. The first {{convert|21|km|mi}} long section Mikhailovo (Khashuri)-Batum was completed on 13 February 1929, the second {{convert|363|km|mi}} long section Mingechaur-Mikhailovo (Khashuri) was completed on 15 December 1929, and the third {{convert|248|km|mi}} long section Baku-Mingechaur was completed on 13 February 1930. The pipeline cost 49&amp;nbsp;million rubles.&lt;ref name=lukoil1/&gt;

The operation of the oil pipeline showed that it was incapable of transporting oil in planned amount  and the capacity was needed to increase by 750,000 tons.&lt;ref name=transneft2/&gt;  In August 1942, the pipeline was dismantled in connection with the threat of penetration of German troops in that direction and its pipes were used for the construction of the [[Astrakhan]]-[[Saratov]] pipeline.&lt;ref name=transnefteprodukt/&gt; In 1990s, some part of the pipeline were used for the construction of the [[Baku-Supsa Pipeline]].

==New pipeline==
There have been several proposals for the new Baku–Batumi pipeline. In 1994-1998, the  Baku-Supsa Pipeline, which partly uses old  Baku–Batum pipeline route, was constructed. On 2 March 1998, [[Chevron Corporation]] agreed to reconstruct existing Khashuri-Batumi pipeline and construct [[Dubandi]] (Baku)- Khashuri pipeline.&lt;ref name=cbr&gt;{{cite journal

Kazakhstan's national oil company [[KazMunayGas]], owner of the Batumi Oil Terminal, has shown interest to build the new Baku–Batumi pipeline, which together with proposed [[Trans-Caspian Oil Pipeline|Trans-Caspian]] and Batumi-[[Constanţa]] connections would allow to supply KazMunayGas [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] in Romania ([[Rompetrol]]) and planned refinery in Batumi.&lt;ref name=trend1&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13955">'''Balloonomania''' was a strong public interest or [[fad]] in [[hot air balloons]] that originated in France in the late 18th century and continued into the 19th century, during the advent of hot air balloon flights. The interest began with the first flights of the [[Montgolfier brothers]] in 1783, and quickly spread in France and across the channel in England.{{sfn|Holmes|2008}}

==Origins==
The science of lighter-than-air gasses, and specifically the properties of [[oxygen]], had been discovered as early as 1774 by [[Joseph Priestley]], who noted its lightness and explosive qualities when heated.{{sfn|Schofield|2004|p=107}} The chemistry of lighter-than-air and heated gasses was eventually put to the test by the [[Montgolfier brothers]], two paper manufacturers in France, while experimenting with heated air caught in paper bags.
Balloonomania saw its true origins, however, in the very first public balloon flight on June 5, 1783, with the launching of a large unmanned paper balloon in the countryside near Annonay. The balloon, which had been constructed by the Mongolfier brothers, was thirty feet tall, made of paper and appears to have been intended as an advertising gimmick for the Montgolfier’s paper manufacturing company.  It was effective, as it drew an enormous crowd of onlookers.
Later balloonists such as [[Jean-Pierre Blanchard]] and [[Vincent Lunardi]] exploited this wonder at the novelty of balloons to draw large crowds and gain personal fame, Lunardi going so far as to proclaim himself an “idol of the whole nation [of England]” in a letter to his guardian.{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=140}}

==Effect on society==

===Public responses===
Early ballooning was met with mixed responses.  Crowds of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic onlookers would turn out for a balloon launch, even threatening to riot if the launch was delayed. Some, however, were not quite as impressed, as shown by the events of August 27, 1783 when professor [[Jacques Charles|Jacques Alexandre César Charles]], who had been commissioned to build a rival balloon to the Mongolfier’s version using hydrogen, launched his balloon from the Champs de Mars before a large crowd including American scientist [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The balloon travelled for “forty-five minutes and fifteen miles to the village of Genoesse, where it was attacked by frightened peasants on landing.” {{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=24}}

Regardless of these negative reactions, which were not in the majority, ballooning quickly caught the imagination of the general populace, with a crowd of up to 400,000 clamoring to see Jacques Charles make a manned ascent in Paris on December 1, 1783. Both Blanchard and Lunardi became famous for their ballooning stunts, with Blanchard and his companion Dr. John Jeffries being the first to cross the English channel in a balloon on January 7, 1785.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=28}}

===Academic and scientific responses===
The public reaction among intellectuals and academics was generally cooler, with some critics of balloonomania including the likes of  [[Sir Joseph Banks]] and [[Samuel Johnson]], who wrote in a 1783 letter to Hester Thrale, who had inquired about the nature of hot air balloons,  “Happy are you, Madam, that have ease and leisure to want intelligence of air balloons. Their existence is, I believe, indubitable, but I know not that they can possibly be of any use.”{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=134}}
Sir Joseph Banks, a prominent natural scientist wrote that he was skeptical of the utility of balloons, though he recognized the revolutionary science behind it: “I see an inclination in the more respectable part of the Royal Society to guard against the Ballomania until some experiment like to prove beneficial either to society or to science is proposed.”{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=126}} However, both men and other scientists and academics would express some personal interest in ballooning, and suggest possible practical purposes, with Banks originally suggesting that perhaps balloons could be used as a way of counterbalancing the weight of a cart or coach, making them easier to move over the ground. Even Johnson recognized the potential for exploration, stating, "How easily shall we trace the Nile through all its passages; pass over to distant regions and examine the face of nature, from one extremity of the Earth to the other." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodgson |first=J.E |title=History of Aeronautics in Great Britain |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1924 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Blanchard's companion Dr. John Jeffries considered ballooning to be a major part of an exploration of the secrets of flight, the nature of the upper atmosphere, and the formation of weather, and took instruments such as a mercury barometer, a thermometer, a hydrometer and an electrometer to take different measurements of the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jeffries |first=John |title=Narrative of Two Aerial Voyages with M. Blanchard as Presented to the Royal Society, London |date=1786 |page=10 |url=https://archive.org/details/narrativeoftwoae00jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There were other positive scientific responses, as well. Upon receiving a letter from a friend chronicling a balloon flight, the astronomer [[William Herschel]] began to think of hot air balloons as possibly useful for observation, as they might carry telescopes into the upper air, where it was clearer. This idea would eventually evolve into sending telescopes into orbit, which became reality in 1990 with the launching of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=135}}

===Collectibles and cartoons===
At its peak, balloonomania triggered a revolution in souvenirs and collectibles, with balloons being featured on “plates, cups, clocks, ivory draughts pieces, snuffboxes, bracelets, tobacco pipes, hairclips, tiepins, even a porcelain bidet with a balloon design painted on the interior." These collectibles proved to be enormously popular among the French populace, starting in the winter of 1783. With the rise of public interest in ballooning, they soon became the subjects of mockery. "Many sexually suggestive cartoons soon appeared: the inevitable balloon-breasted girls lifted off their feet, monstrous aeronauts inflated by gas enemas, or ‘inflammable’ women carrying men off into the clouds.”{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=132}}

===Literature===
Balloonomania, merely as a novelty, served as the inspiration for various poets, such as [[Edward Nares]], author of the Ballooniad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nicolson |first=Marjorie |title=Thomas Paine, Edward Nares, and Mrs. Piozzi's Marginalia |journal=The Huntington Library Bulletin |publisher=University of California Press |date=October 1936 |page=104 |jstor=3818142}}&lt;/ref&gt; a street ballad about hot air ballooning, which mentioned the notion of flying to the moon.

{{poemquote
|text=Advent’rous youth! What urged thy distant flight,
Beyond the finite ken of human sight?
Seest thou yon silver orb men call the moon?
Thither now speed thee with thy air balloon.
|source=Edward Nares&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ballooniad in two cantos |edition=Second |publisher=Birmingham |date=1785 |via=Gale |access-date=8 February 2010 |url=http://find.galegroup.com/ecco/infomark.do?&amp;contentSet=ECCOArticles&amp;type=multipage&amp;tabID=T001&amp;prodId=ECCO&amp;docId=CW116659434&amp;source=gale&amp;userGroupName=wisc_madison&amp;version=1.0&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE |last=Nares |first=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Balloonomania would exert a pull on the imaginations of some of the Romantic poets as well. Ballooning appealed to Romantic writer's ideas of the sublime, such as [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who wrote of balloons as being “an image of human longing and inspiration, both uplifting and terrifying”{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=161}} and [[William Wordsworth]], who opened the poem “[[Peter Bell (Wordsworth)|Peter Bell]]” with the image of a balloon boat:
{{poemquote
|text=There’s something in a flying Horse,
There’s something in a huge balloon:
But through the Clouds I’ll never float
Until I have a little Boat
Shaped like the crescent-moon.
|source=William Wordsworth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wordsworth |first=William |title=Peter Bell |publisher=Strahan and Spottiswoode |location=London |date=1819 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFkJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Their point was not lost on the balloonists themselves, as Dr. Alexandre Charles found himself making the first solo voyage in a hot air balloon on December 1, 1783, an unplanned accident after Dr. Charles' companion stepped out of the balloon, which then relaunched itself with only Charles inside. He wrote, "Never has a man felt so solitary, so sublime-and so utterly terrified." Dr. Charles never went up in a balloon again.{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=132}}

[[Percy Shelley]] also wrote of balloons, saying, “It would seem a mere toy, a feather, in comparison with the splendid anticipations of the philosophical chemist. Yet it ought not to be altogether condemned, It promises prodigious faculties for locomotion, and will allow us to traverse vast tracts with ease and rapidity, and to explore unknown countries without difficulty. Why are we so ignorant of the interior of Africa?—Why do we not dispatch intrepid aeronauts to cross it in every direction and to survey the whole peninsula in a few weeks? The shadow of the first balloon… as it glided over that unhappy country, would virtually emancipate every slave, and would annihilate slavery forever.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Thomas Jefferson |title=Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley |publisher=George Routledge and Sons |location=London |date=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shelley also wrote a sonnet entitled “To a balloon, laden with Knowledge” which reads:

{{poemquote
|text=Bright ball of flame that thro the gloom of even
Silently takest thine etherial way
And with surpassing glory dimmst each ray
Twinkling amid the dark blue Depths of Heaven
Unlike the Fire thou bearest, soon shall thou
Fade like a meteor in surrounding gloom
Whilst that unquencheable is doomed to glow
A watch light by the patriots lonely tomb
A ray of courage to the opprest &amp; poor,
A spark tho' gleaming on the hovel's hearth
Which thro the tyrants gilded domes shall roar
A beacon in the darkness of the Earth
A Sun which oer the renovated scene
Shall dart like Truth where Falshood yet has been
|source=Percy Shelley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rabbe |first=Felix |title=Shelley: The Man and the Poet |publisher=A.C. McClurg &amp; Co. |location=Chicago |date=1888 |page=166 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYj8TjiJuDkC&amp;pg=PA166}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Balloonomania was not universal amongst the Romantic poets, however. In contrast to Coleridge, Wordsworth and Shelley, [[William Blake]] mocked and satirized the idea of manned flight in his unfinished prose work “An Island in the Moon”{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=143}}

Even after the end of the Romantic period, Balloonomania continued to have an effect on later literary work, including on the early science fiction writer [[Jules Verne]] who wrote the book Five Weeks in a Balloon in 1863, about the ballooning adventures of two explorers and their manservant in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Verne |first=Jules |title=Five Weeks in a Balloon |publisher=Sutton Publishing |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military===
{{main|History of military ballooning}}
The military applications of hot air balloons were recognized early, with Joseph Montgolfier jokingly suggesting in 1782 that the French could fly an entire army suspended underneath hundreds of paper bags into Gibraltar to seize it from the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rolt |first=L.T.C. |title=The Aeronauts |publisher=Walker &amp; Co. |location=New York |date=1966 |isbn=9780862992132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Military leaders and political leaders soon began to see a more practical potential for balloons to be used in warfare; specifically in the role of reconnaissance. The first recorded use of a balloon in warfare was the deployment of a balloon called L'Entrepremant by the French at the battle of Fleurus in 1794, which resulted in a French victory over a coalition of British and Austrian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Military Use of Balloons During the Napoleonic Era |author=US Centennial of Flight Commission |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Lighter_than_air/Napoleon's_wars/LTA3.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528025354/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Lighter_than_air/Napoleon%27s_wars/LTA3.htm |archive-date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After that victory, [[Napoleon]] started an air balloon corps based in Meudon, and there were fears in England of an aerial invasion, though this never came to pass.  Napoleon took his balloon corps to Egypt in 1798, but their equipment was destroyed by [[Horatio Nelson]] at the [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Aboukir]], and Napoleon disbanded his balloon corps in 1799.{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=156}}
Balloons would later be used in the American Civil War for reconnaissance and directing artillery barrages on foes that were out of view of the artillerymen on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Charles M. |title=The War of the Aeronauts: a history of ballooning during the Civil War |publisher=Stackpole books |date=2002 |isbn=9780811713955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''can wrench''' is a [[wrench]] made to open a telephone distribution terminal also called a [[telco can]] or [[demarcation point]] box. One end of the can wrench is a 7/16 inch hex socket used for recessed fasteners on closures, and the other end is a 3/8 inch hex socket for use on binding posts. The wrench is also referred to as a 216C tool which was the Bell System specification version. They are often insulated against electric shock. The hex socket on each end is a thin wall thickness to allow the outside diameter to be placed into the tight recessed access often found on telco cans and demarc boxes.

Carbon-neutral fuels are used in Germany and Iceland for [[Power storage#Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel|distributed storage of renewable energy]], minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency, and enabling transmission of wind, water, and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines.

==Production==
Carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic hydrocarbons. They can be produced in chemical reactions between carbon dioxide, which can be captured from power plants or the air, and hydrogen, which is created by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy. The fuel, often referred to as [[electrofuel]], stores the energy that was used in the production of the hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearson |first=Richard |author2=Eisaman |title=Energy Storage Via Carbon-Neutral Fuels Made From Carbon dioxide, Water, and Renewable Energy |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |date=2011 |url=http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |accessdate=18 October 2012 |doi=10.1109/jproc.2011.2168369 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=440–460 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508220516/http://www.uk-shec.org.uk/uk-shec/news/IEEE_Paper_6_3_5_finalx1x.pdf |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.359.8746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coal can also be used to produce the hydrogen, but that would not be a carbon-neutral source. Carbon dioxide can be captured and buried, making fossil fuels carbon-neutral, although not renewable. Carbon capture from exhaust gas can make carbon-neutral fuels carbon negative. Other hydrocarbons can be broken down to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide which could then be stored while the hydrogen is used for energy or fuel, which would also be carbon-neutral.&lt;ref name=Kleiner&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleiner |first=kurt |title=Carbon Neutral Fuel; a new approach |journal=The Globe and Mail |date=17 January 2009 |pages=F4 |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=303830&amp;sr=HLEAD(CARBON-NEUTRAL+FUEL)+and+date+is+January+17%2C+2009 |accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most energy-efficient fuel to produce is [[hydrogen]] gas,&lt;ref name ="ubaposition"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/377/publikationen/uba_position_powertoliquid_engl.pdf |title =Integration of Power to Gas/Power to Liquids into the ongoing transformation process |date = June 2016|accessdate = August 10, 2017 |page =12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be used in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and which requires the fewest process steps to produce.

Methanol can be made from a chemical reaction of a carbon-dioxide molecule with three hydrogen molecules to produce methanol and water. The stored energy can be recovered by burning the methanol in a combustion engine, releasing carbon dioxide, water, and heat. [[Methane]] can be produced in a similar reaction. Special precautions against methane leaks are important since methane is nearly 100 times as potent as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in terms of [[Global warming potential]]. More energy can be used to combine methanol or methane into larger hydrocarbon fuel molecules.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using methanol to produce [[dimethyl ether]]. This fuel could be used as a substitute for diesel fuel due to its ability to self ignite under high pressure and temperature. It is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation. It is nontoxic, but must be stored under pressure.&lt;ref name=Olah&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olah |first=George |author2=Alain Geoppert |author3=G. K.

All synthetic hydrocarbons are generally produced at temperatures of 200–300&amp;nbsp;°C, and at pressures of 20 to 50 bar. [[Catalyst]]s are usually used to improve the efficiency of the reaction and create the desired type of hydrocarbon fuel. Such reactions are exothermic and use about 3&amp;nbsp;mol of hydrogen per mole of carbon dioxide involved. They also produce large amounts of water as a byproduct.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Sources of carbon for recycling ==
The most economical source of carbon for recycling into fuel is [[flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion]] where it can be obtained for about USD $7.50 per ton.&lt;ref name=MacDowell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name= Pennline2010/&gt; Automobile exhaust gas capture has also been seen as economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting.&lt;ref name=Musadi2011&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Musadi |first=M.R. |last2=Martin |first2=P. |last3=Garforth |first3=A. |last4=Mann |first4=R. |date=2011 |title=Carbon neutral gasoline re-synthesised from on-board sequestrated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |journal=Chemical Engineering Transactions |volume=24 |pages=1525–30 |doi=10.3303/CET1124255 |url=http://www.aidic.it/cet/11/24/255.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since carbonic acid in seawater is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with atmospheric carbon dioxide, extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiMascio |first=Felice |last2=Willauer |first2=Heather D. |authorlink2=Heather Willauer |last3=Hardy |first3=Dennis R. |last4=Lewis |first4=M.

Proposals for this method involve using a caustic chemical to react with carbon dioxide in the air to produce [[carbonate]]s. These can then be broken down and hydrated to release pure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas and regenerate the caustic chemical. This process requires more energy than other methods because carbon dioxide is at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than in other sources.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt;

Researchers have also suggested using biomass as a carbon source for fuel production. Adding hydrogen to the biomass would reduce its carbon to produce fuel. This method has the advantage of using plant matter to cheaply capture carbon dioxide. The plants also add some chemical energy to the fuel from biological molecules. This may be a more efficient use of biomass than conventional [[biofuel]] because it uses most of the carbon and chemical energy from the biomass instead of releasing as much energy and carbon. Its main disadvantage is, as with conventional ethanol production, it competes with food production.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt;

== Renewable and nuclear energy costs ==

Nighttime [[wind power]] is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel, because the [[load curve]] for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day, but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day. Therefore, the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative. Off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the U.S. averaged 1.64 cents per [[kilowatt-hour]] in 2009, but only 0.71 cents/kWh during the least expensive six hours of the day.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; Typically, [[wholesale]] electricity costs 2 to 5 cents/kWh during the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newfuelist.com/ Electricity Price] ''NewFuelist.com'' (compare to [http://dotyenergy.com/Images/windprice-2010-W.jpg off-peak wind power price graph.]) Retrieved September 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce gasoline for less than [[petroleum]] fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |last=Holte |first=Laura L. |last2=Doty |first2=Glenn N. |last3=McCree |first3=David L. |last4=Doty |first4=Judy M. |last5=Doty |first5=F.

In 2010, a team of process chemists led by [[Heather Willauer]] of the U.S. Navy, estimates that 100 megawatts of electricity can produce 41,000 gallons of [[jet fuel]] per day and shipboard production from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon. While that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010, it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue. Moreover, since the delivery of fuel to a [[carrier battle group]] costs about $8 per gallon, shipboard production is already much less expensive.&lt;ref name="jetsea"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Willauer |first=Heather D. |last2=Hardy |first2=Dennis R. |last3=Williams |first3=Frederick W. |date=September 29, 2010 |title=''Feasibility and Current Estimated Capital Costs of Producing Jet Fuel at Sea'' |publisher=Chemistry Division, Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory |location=Washington, DC |type=memorandum report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA539765 |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greenhouse gas remediation ==
Carbon-neutral fuels can lead to greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere. Capturing the carbon dioxide in flue gas emissions from power plants would eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions, although burning the fuel in vehicles would release that carbon because there is no economical way to capture those emissions.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012/&gt; This approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about 50% if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants. Most [[coal power plant|coal]] and [[natural gas power plant]]s have been predicted to be economically retrofittable with [[carbon dioxide scrubber]]s for [[carbon capture]] to recycle flue exhaust or for [[carbon sequestration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |last=DiPietro |first=Phil |last2=Nichols |first2=Chris |last3=Marquis |first3=Michael |date=January 2011 |title=''Coal-Fired Power Plants in the United States: Examination of the Costs of Retrofitting with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Technology, Revision 3'' |publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy |type=report NETL-402/102309 |docket=DOE contract DE-AC26-04NT41817 |url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/energy-analyses/pubs/GIS_CCS_retrofit.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Socolow2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=House2011/&gt; Such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess [[economic impacts of climate change]] if it were not done, but also to pay for itself as global fuel [[economic demand|demand]] growth and [[peak oil]] shortages increase the price of [[petroleum]] and [[Fungibility|fungible]] [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name=Goeppert2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lackner2012/&gt;

Capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly from the air or extracting carbonic acid from seawater would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment, and create a closed cycle of carbon to eliminate new carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008 /&gt; Use of these methods would eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely, assuming that enough renewable energy could be generated to produce the fuel.

== Traditional fuels, methanol or ethanol ==
{{See also|Methanol economy}}

Some authorities have recommended producing [[methanol]] instead of traditional transportation fuels. It is a liquid at normal temperatures and can be toxic if ingested. Methanol has a higher [[octane rating]] than gasoline but a lower [[energy density]], and can be mixed with other fuels or used on its own. It may also be used in the production of more complex hydrocarbons and polymers. Direct methanol fuel cells have been developed by Caltech's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] to convert methanol and oxygen into electricity.&lt;ref name=Olah /&gt; It is possible to convert methanol into gasoline, jet fuel or other hydrocarbons, but that requires additional energy and more complex production facilities.&lt;ref name=Pearson2012 /&gt; Methanol is slightly more corrosive than traditional fuels, requiring automobile modifications on the order of USD $100 each to use it.&lt;ref name=Zeman2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Steinberg1995&gt;{{Cite report |last=Steinberg |first=Meyer |date=August 1995 |title=''The Carnol Process for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Mitigation from Power Plants and the Transportation Sector |publisher=Department of Advanced Technology, Brookhaven National Laboratory |location=Upton, New York |type=informal report BNL–62110 |docket=(Prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-76CH00016) |url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/100204-X2uZUC/webviewable/100204.pdf |accessdate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Colour Television Test.jpg|thumb|300px|A color television test at the [[Mount Kaukau]] transmitting station, [[New Zealand]], in 1970. A [[test pattern]] with color bars is sometimes used when no program material is available.]]
'''Color television''' is a [[television]] transmission technology that includes information on the [[color]] of the picture, so the video image can be displayed in color on the television set.  It is an improvement on the earliest television technology, [[monochrome]] or [[black and white television]], in which the image is displayed in shades of gray ([[grayscale]]). [[Television broadcasting]] stations and networks in most parts of the world upgraded from black and white to color transmission in the 1970s and 1980s. The invention of color television standards is an important part of the [[history of television]], and it is described in the [[technology of television]] article.

Transmission of color images using mechanical scanners had been conceived as early as the 1880s. A practical demonstration of mechanically-scanned color television was given by [[John Logie Baird]] in 1928, but the limitations of a mechanical system were apparent even then. Development of electronic scanning and display made an all-electronic system possible.  Early monochrome transmission standards were developed prior to the Second World War, but civilian electronics developments were frozen during much of the war. In August 1950, Baird gave the world's first demonstration of a practical fully electronic color television display. In the United States, commercially competing color standards were developed, finally resulting in the NTSC standard for color that retained compatibility with the prior monochrome system. Although the NTSC color standard was proclaimed in 1953 and limited programming became available, it was not until the early 1970s that color television in North America outsold black and white or monochrome units.  Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] formats until the 1960s.

Around 2006 countries began to switch from analog color television technology to [[digital television]]. This changeover is now complete in many developed countries, but analog television is still the standard in many developing countries.

==Development==
The human eye's detection system, which is in the [[retina]], consists primarily of two types of light detectors: [[rod cells]] that capture light, dark, and shapes/figures, and the [[cone cells]] that detect color. A typical retina contains 120 million rods and 4.5 million to 6 million cones, which are divided among three groups that are sensitive to red, green, and blue light. This means that the eye has far more resolution in brightness, or "[[luminance]]", than in [[color]]. However, post-processing of the optic nerve and other portions of the human visual system combine the information from the rods and cones to re-create what appears to be a high-resolution color image.

The eye has limited bandwidth to the rest of the visual system, estimated at just under 8 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Reilly, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-speed-of-sight "Calculating the speed of sight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910114905/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9633-calculating-the-speed-of-sight/ |date=September 10, 2017 }}, ''New Scientist'', July 28, 2006, &lt;/ref&gt; This manifests itself in a number of ways, but the most important in terms of producing moving images is the way that a series of still images displayed in quick succession will appear to be continuous smooth motion. This illusion starts to work at about 16 [[frames per second|frame/s]], and common motion pictures use 24 frame/s. Television, using power from the [[electrical grid]], tunes its rate in order to avoid interference with the [[alternating current]] being supplied – in North America, some Central and South American countries, Taiwan, Korea, part of Japan, the Philippines, and a few other countries, this is 60 [[Field (video)|video fields]] per second to match the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz power, while in most other countries it is 50 fields per second to match the 50&amp;nbsp; Hz power.

In its most basic form, a color broadcast can be created by broadcasting three monochrome images, one each in the three colors of [[red]], green, and blue (RGB). When displayed together or in rapid succession, these images will blend together to produce a full-color image as seen by the viewer. One of the great technical challenges of introducing color [[broadcast television]] was the desire to conserve [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], potentially three times that of the existing [[black-and-white]] standards, and not use an excessive amount of [[radio spectrum]]. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee&lt;ref name=name&gt;National Television System Committee (1951–1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12–19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;PAGE=First Library of Congress Online Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; approved an all-electronic system developed by [[RCA]] which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the eye to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image. The [[NTSC]] standard represented a major technical achievement.

===Early television===
Experiments in television systems using radio broadcasts date to the 19th century, but it was not until the 20th century that advances in electronics and light detectors made development practical. A key problem was the need to convert a 2D image into a "1D" radio signal; some form of image scanning was needed to make this work. Early systems generally used a device known as a "[[Nipkow disk]]", which was a spinning disk with a series of holes punched in it that caused a spot to scan across and down the image. A single photodetector behind the disk captured the image brightness at any given spot, which was converted into a radio signal and broadcast. A similar disk was used at the receiver side, with a light source behind the disk instead of a detector.

A number of such systems were being used experimentally in the 1920s. The best-known was [[John Logie Baird]]'s, which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in Britain for several years. Indeed, Baird's system was demonstrated to members of the Royal Institution in London in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true, working television system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/baird_logie.shtml|title=BBC - History - John Logie Baird|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=John Logie Baird: A Life|last=Kamm|first=Antony|last2=Baird|first2=John|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of these early successes, all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems. Being mechanically driven, perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs was not easy to ensure, and irregularities could result in major image distortion. Another problem was that the image was scanned within a small, roughly rectangular area of the disk's surface, so that larger, higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images. Rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than Nipkow discs for high-resolution mechanical scanning, allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced, but such delicate, high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

It was clear to a number of developers that a completely electronic scanning system would be superior, and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means. Converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances. The two key advances were [[Philo Farnsworth]]'s electronic scanning system, and [[Vladimir Zworykin]]'s [[Iconoscope]] camera. The Iconoscope, based on [[Kálmán Tihanyi]]'s early patents, superseded the Farnsworth-system. With these systems, the [[BBC]] began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936, but these were shut down again with the start of [[World War II]] in 1939. In this time thousands of television sets had been sold. The receivers developed for this program, notably those from [[Pye Ltd.]], played a key role in the development of [[radar]].

By 22 March 1935, 180-line black-and-white television programs were being broadcast from the [[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow|Paul Nipkow TV station]] in [[Berlin]]. In 1936, under the guidance of "Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda" [[Joseph Goebbels]], direct transmissions from fifteen mobile units at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games in Berlin]] were transmitted to selected small television houses ({{lang|de|Fernsehstuben}}) in Berlin and Hamburg.

In 1941, the first [[NTSC]] meetings produced a single standard for US broadcasts. US television broadcasts began in earnest in the immediate post-war era, and by 1950 there were 6 million televisions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Television", ''The World Book Encyclopedia'' 2003: 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===All-mechanical color===
The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built.

Among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no practical details.&lt;ref&gt;M. Le Blanc, "Etude sur la transmission électrique des impressions lumineuses", ''La Lumière Electrique'', vol. 11, December 1, 1880, p. 477–481.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish inventor [[Jan Szczepanik]] patented a color television system in 1897, using a [[selenium]] photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Burns, ''Television: An International History of the Formative Years'', IET, 1998, p. 98. {{ISBN|0-85296-914-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An Armenian inventor, [[Hovannes Adamian]], also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,&lt;ref&gt;Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C. Sutton, Business &amp; Economics - 1973, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; and was patented in [[Germany]] on March 31, 1908, patent № 197183, then in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], on April 1, 1908, patent № 7219,&lt;ref&gt;The History of Television, 1880-1941, by Albert Abramson, 1987, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; in [[France]] (patent № 390326) and in [[Russia]] in 1910 (patent № 17912).&lt;ref name="tvmuseum.ru"&gt;[http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 A. Rokhlin, Tak rozhdalos' dal'novidenie (in Russian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424162531/http://www.tvmuseum.ru/attach.asp?a_no=1018 |date=April 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish inventor [[John Logie Baird]] demonstrated the world's first color transmission on July 3, 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources, controlled by the signal, at the receiving end, with a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] to alternate their illumination.&lt;ref&gt;John Logie Baird, [http://www.google.com/patents?id=JRVAAAAAEBAJ Television Apparatus and the Like], U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration was of a young girl wearing different colored hats. [[Noele Gordon]] went on to become a successful TV actress, famous for the soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]''. Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on February 4, 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] studios to a projection screen at London's [[Dominion Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html Crystal Palace Television Studios] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205202439/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/crystalpalace.html |date=February 5, 2015 }}. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by [[Bell Laboratories]] in June 1929 using three complete systems of [[Solar cell|photoelectric cells]], amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image.

===Hybrid systems===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}
As was the case with black-and-white television, an electronic means of scanning would be superior to the mechanical systems like Baird's. The obvious solution on the broadcast end would be to use three conventional Iconoscopes with colored filters in front of them to produce an RGB signal. Using three separate tubes each looking at the same scene would produce slight differences in parallax between the frames, so in practice a single lens was used with a mirror or prism system to separate the colors for the separate tubes. Each tube captured a complete frame and the signal was converted into radio in a fashion essentially identical to the existing black-and-white systems.

The problem with this approach was there was no simple way to recombine them on the receiver end. If each image was sent at the same time on different frequencies, the images would have to be "stacked" somehow on the display, in real time. The simplest way to do this would be to reverse the system used in the camera: arrange three separate black-and-white displays behind colored filters and then optically combine their images using mirrors or prisms onto a suitable screen, like [[frosted glass]]. [[RCA]] built just such a system in order to present the first electronically scanned color television demonstration on February 5, 1940,  privately shown to members of the US Federal Communications Commission at the RCA plant in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon Kilbon, ''Pioneering in Electronics: A Short History of the Origins and Growth of RCA Laboratories, Radio Corporation of America, 1919 to 1964'', [http://www.davidsarnoff.org/kil-chapter09.html Chapter Nine – Television: Monochrome to Color] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430082903/http://www.davidsarnoff.org/kil-chapter09.html |date=April 30, 2008 }}, 1964. V.K. Zworykin with Frederick Olessi, ''Iconoscope: An Autobiography of Vladimir Zworykin'', [http://www.davidsarnoff.org/vkz-chapter10.html Chapter 10 – Television Becomes a Reality, 1945–1954] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419083408/http://www.davidsarnoff.org/vkz-chapter10.html |date=April 19, 2008 }}, 1971. "The system used two color filters in combination with photocells and a flying spot scanner for pickup." Alfred V. Roman, ''The Historical Development of Color Television Systems'', doctoral dissertation, New York University, 1967, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; This system, however, suffered from the twin problems of costing at least three times as much as a conventional black-and-white set, as well as having very dim pictures, the result of the fairly low illumination given off by tubes of the era. Projection systems of this sort would become common decades later, however, with improvements in technology.

Another solution would be to use a single screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead of an even coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate electron gun, aimed at its colored phosphor. Although obvious, this solution was not practical. The [[electron gun]]s used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would have to focus on individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond the [[state of the art]] at the time.

Instead, a number of hybrid solutions were developed that combined a conventional monochrome display with a colored disk or mirror. In these systems the three colored images were sent one after each other, in either complete frames in the "[[field-sequential color system]]", or for each line in the "line-sequential" system. In both cases a colored filter was rotated in front of the display in sync with the broadcast. Since three separate images were being sent in sequence, if they used existing monochrome radio signaling standards they would have an effective refresh rate of only 20 fields, or 10 frames, a second, well into the region where flicker would become visible. In order to avoid this, these systems increased the frame rate considerably, making the signal incompatible with existing monochrome standards.

The first practical example of this sort of system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and-white display with a rotating colored disk. This device was very "deep", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|title=The World's First High Definition Colour Television System|author=|date=|website=www.bairdtelevision.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403170543/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html|archivedate=April 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baird was not happy with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better.

In 1939, Hungarian engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark]] introduced an electro-mechanical system while at [[CBS]], which contained an [[Iconoscope]] sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.&lt;ref name="Goldmark1"&gt;Peter C.

===Fully electronic===
[[File:Baird first color photo.jpg|thumb|right|This live image of Paddy Naismith was used to demonstrate [[John Logie Baird]]'s first all-electronic color television system, which used two projection CRTs. The two-color image would be similar to the basic telechrome system.]]
As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the "[[Telechrome]]". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called "stereoscopic" at the time). Baird's demonstration on August 16, 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hempstead|first1=Colin|title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology|date=2005|publisher=Routledge|page=824}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2003, pp. 13–14. {{ISBN|0-7864-1220-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird Television: [http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html The World's First High Definition Colour Television System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403170543/http://www.bairdtelevision.com/colour.html |date=April 3, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 50s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The [[Geer tube]] was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The [[Penetron]] used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The [[Chromatron]] used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.

====FCC color====
In the immediate post-war era the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) was inundated with requests to set up new television stations. Worrying about congestion of the limited number of channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new [[UHF]] bands for television broadcast. At the time, black and white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able to tune in these stations, they were free to pick an incompatible system and allow the older [[VHF]] channels to die off over time.

The FCC called for technical demonstrations of color systems in 1948, and the Joint Technical Advisory Committee (JTAC) was formed to study them. CBS displayed improved versions of its original design, now using a single 6&amp;nbsp;MHz channel (like the existing black-and-white signals) at 144 fields per second and 405 lines of resolution. [[Color Television Inc.]] demonstrated its line-sequential system, while [[Philco]] demonstrated a dot-sequential system based on its [[beam-index tube]]-based "Apple" tube technology. Of the entrants, the CBS system was by far the best-developed, and won head-to-head testing every time.

While the meetings were taking place it was widely known within the industry that RCA was working on a dot-sequential system that was compatible with existing black-and-white broadcasts, but RCA declined to demonstrate it during the first series of meetings. Just before the JTAC presented its findings, on August 25, 1949, RCA broke its silence and introduced its system as well. The JTAC still recommended the CBS system, and after the resolution of an ensuing RCA lawsuit, color broadcasts using the CBS system started on June 25, 1951. By this point the market had changed dramatically; when color was first being considered in 1948 there were fewer than a million television sets in the U.S., but by 1951 there were well over 10 million. The idea that the VHF band could be allowed to "die" was no longer practical.

During its campaign for FCC approval, CBS gave the first demonstrations of color television to the general public, showing an hour of color programs daily Mondays through Saturdays, beginning January 12, 1950, and running for the remainder of the month, over [[WUSA (TV)|WOIC]] in Washington, D.C., where the programs could be viewed on eight 16-inch color receivers in a public building.&lt;ref&gt;"Washington Chosen for First Color Showing; From Ages 4 to 90, Audience Amazed", ''The Washington Post'', January 13, 1950, p. B2.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to high public demand, the broadcasts were resumed February 13–21, with several evening programs added.&lt;ref&gt;"Color TV Tests To Be Resumed In Washington", ''The Washington Post'', February 12, 1950, p. M5.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS initiated a limited schedule of color broadcasts from its New York station [[WCBS-TV]] Mondays to Saturdays beginning November 14, 1950, making ten color receivers available for the viewing public.&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Color Television To Make Public Debut In N.Y.

"Video Color Test Begins on C.B.S.," ''New York Times'', November 14, 1950, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York broadcasts were extended by [[coaxial cable]] to Philadelphia's [[WCAU|WCAU-TV]] beginning December 13,&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Color Preview Seen By 2,000 in Philadelphia", ''The Wall Street Journal'', December 16, 1950, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and to Chicago on January 10,&lt;ref&gt;"CBS to Display Color Video in City Next Week", ''Chicago Tribune'', January 6, 1951, television and radio section, p. C4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Preview of CBS Color TV Wins City's Acclaim", ''Chicago Tribune'', January 10, 1951, p. A8.&lt;/ref&gt; making them the first network color broadcasts.

After a series of hearings beginning in September 1949, the FCC found the RCA and CTI systems fraught with technical problems, inaccurate color reproduction, and expensive equipment, and so formally approved the CBS system as the U.S. color broadcasting standard on October 11, 1950. An unsuccessful lawsuit by RCA delayed the first commercial network broadcast in color until June 25, 1951, when a musical variety special titled simply [[Premiere (TV program)|''Premiere'']] was shown over a network of five East Coast CBS affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;"C.B.S. Color Video Presents a 'First'," ''New York Times'', June 26, 1951, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing was again restricted: the program could not be seen on black-and-white sets, and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] estimated that only thirty prototype color receivers were available in the New York area.&lt;ref&gt;Four-hundred guests watched the premiere commercial broadcast on eight color receivers at a CBS studio in New York, as no color receivers were available to the general public. "C.B.S. Color Video Presents a 'First"", ''New York Times'', June 26, 1951, p. 31. A total of about 40 color receivers was available in the five cities on the color network. The CBS affiliate in Washington had three receivers and a monitor. "First Sponsored TV in Color Praised by WTOP Audience", ''The Washington Post'', June 26, 1951, p. 1. Most of the remainder of the prototype color receivers were given to advertisers sponsoring the color broadcasts. "Today, June 25, 1951, is a turning point in broadcasting history" (WTOP-TV advertisement), ''The Washington Post'', June 25, 1951, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Regular color broadcasts began that same week with the daytime series ''[[The World Is Yours (TV series)|The World Is Yours]]'' and ''[[Modern Homemakers]]''.

Three exceptions among the major television manufacturers were [[Philco]], which offered 11 models that could show CBS color broadcasts in black-and-white; and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] and [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|Admiral]], which offered adapters to receive color broadcasts in black and white.

CBS had bought a television manufacturer in April,&lt;ref&gt;"Hytron's Deal With CBS Seen TV Color Aid", ''The Washington Post'', April 12, 1951, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 1951, production began on the only CBS-Columbia color television model, with the first color sets reaching retail stores on September 28.&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Subsidiary Starts Mass Production of Color Television Sets," ''Wall Street Journal'', September 13, 1951, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=oCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 Para-TV Color Sets To Go On Sale Soon]", ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', October 6, 1951, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was too little, too late. Only 200 sets had been shipped, and only 100 sold, when CBS discontinued its color television system on October 20, 1951, ostensibly by request of the [[National Production Authority]] for the duration of the [[Korean War]], and bought back all the CBS color sets it could to prevent lawsuits by disappointed customers.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q=cbs+color#v=snippet&amp;q=cbs%20color&amp;f=false Text of Note to CBS Asking Color Set Halt]", ''Billboard'', October 27, 1951, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Color TV Shelved As a Defense Step," ''New York Times'', October 20, 1951, p. 1.

====Compatible color====
While the FCC was holding its JTAC meetings, development was taking place on a number of systems allowing true simultaneous color broadcasts, "[[dot-sequential color system]]s". Unlike the hybrid systems, dot-sequential televisions used a signal very similar to existing black-and-white broadcasts, with the intensity of every dot on the screen being sent in succession.

In 1938 [[Georges Valensi]] demonstrated an encoding scheme that would allow color broadcasts to be encoded so they could be picked up on existing black-and-white sets as well. In his system the output of the three camera tubes were re-combined to produce a single "[[Luma (video)|luminance]]" value that was very similar to a monochrome signal and could be broadcast on the existing VHF frequencies. The color information was encoded in a separate "[[chrominance]]" signal, consisting of two separate signals, the original blue signal minus the luminance (B'–Y'), and red-luma (R'–Y'). These signals could then be broadcast separately on a different frequency; a monochrome set would tune in only the luminance signal on the VHF band, while color televisions would tune in both the luminance and chrominance on two different frequencies, and apply the reverse transforms to retrieve the original RGB signal. The downside to this approach is that it required a major boost in bandwidth use, something the FCC was interested in avoiding.

RCA used Valensi's concept as the basis of all of its developments, believing it to be the only proper solution to the broadcast problem. However, RCA's early sets using mirrors and other projection systems all suffered from image and color quality problems, and were easily bested by CBS's hybrid system. But solutions to these problems were in the pipeline, and RCA in particular was investing massive sums (later estimated at $100 million) to develop a usable dot-sequential tube. RCA was beaten to the punch by the [[Geer tube]], which used three B&amp;W tubes aimed at different faces of colored pyramids to produce a color image. All-electronic systems included the [[Chromatron]], [[Penetron]] and [[beam-index tube]] that were being developed by various companies. While investigating all of these, RCA's teams quickly started focusing on the [[shadow mask]] system.

In July 1938 the [[shadow mask]] color television was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900–1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the [[Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin|International radio exhibition Berlin]] in 1939. Most CRT color televisions used today are based on this technology. His solution to the problem of focusing the electron guns on the tiny colored dots was one of brute-force; a metal sheet with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed through the holes the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The downside to this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.

In spite of these problems in both the broadcast and display systems, RCA pressed ahead with development and was ready for a second assault on the standards by 1950.

====Second NTSC====
The possibility of a compatible color broadcast system was so compelling that the NTSC decided to re-form, and held a second series of meetings starting in January 1950. Having only recently selected the CBS system, the FCC heavily opposed the NTSC's efforts. One of the FCC Commissioners, R. F. Jones, went so far as to assert that the engineers testifying in favor of a compatible system were "in a conspiracy against the public interest".

Unlike the FCC approach where a standard was simply selected from the existing candidates, the NTSC would produce a board that was considerably more pro-active in development.

Starting before CBS color even got on the air, the U.S. television industry, represented by the [[NTSC|National Television System Committee]], worked in 1950–1953 to develop a color system that was compatible with existing black-and-white sets and would pass FCC quality standards, with RCA developing the hardware elements. ("Compatible color," a phrase from advertisements for early sets, appears in the song "America" of ''[[West Side Story]]'', 1957.) RCA first made publicly announced field tests of the dot sequential color system over its New York station [[WNBC|WNBT]] in July 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"RCA to Test Color TV System On Three Shows Daily Beginning Today", ''The Wall Street Journal'', July 9, 1951, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; When CBS testified before Congress in March 1953 that it had no further plans for its own color system,&lt;ref&gt;"CBS Says Confusion Now Bars Color TV," ''Washington Post'', March 26, 1953, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[National Production Authority]] dropped its ban on the manufacture of color television receivers,&lt;ref&gt;"N.P.A.

Rules Color TV Can Go on Air at Once," ''New York Times'', December 19, 1953, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The first publicly announced network demonstration of a program using the NTSC "compatible color" system was an episode of NBC's ''[[Kukla, Fran and Ollie]]'' on August 30, 1953, although it was viewable in color only at the network's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;"NBC Launches First {{Sic|?|hide=y|Publicly|-}}Announced Color Television Show," ''Wall Street Journal'', August 31, 1953, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The first network broadcast to go out over the air in NTSC color was a performance of the opera ''[[Carmen]]'' on October 31, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Firsts in Television] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141225155750/http://colortelevision.info/rca-nbc_firsts.html |date=December 25, 2014 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Gould, "Television in Review: Further Thoughts on Color", ''The New York Times'', November 2, 1953, p. 34.

But the color transmissions ended when broadcasting stations were seized in the [[Cuban Revolution]] in 1959, and did not return until 1975, using equipment acquired from Japan's [[NEC Corporation]], and [[SECAM]] equipment from the Soviet Union, adapted for the American NTSC standard.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Diaz-Martin, "The Recent History of Satellite Communications in Cuba", [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4217/ch19.htm Selection of a Color Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225231626/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4217/ch19.htm |date=December 25, 2017 }}, in ''Beyond the Ionosphere: Fifty Years of Satellite Communication'' (NASA SP-4217, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 1946 González Camarena sent his first color transmission from his lab in the offices of The Mexican League of Radio Experiments at Lucerna St. No. 1, in [[Mexico City]]. The video signal was transmitted at a frequency of 115&amp;nbsp;MHz. and the audio in the 40 metre band. He obtained authorization to make the first publicly announced color broadcast in Mexico, on February 8, 1963, of the program ''Paraíso Infantil'' on Mexico City's [[XHGC-TV]], using the NTSC system which had by now been adopted as the standard for color programming.

González Camarena also invented the ''Simplified Mexican Color TV system'' as a much simpler and cheaper alternative to the NTSC system.&lt;ref name="Simplified-Mexican"&gt;

Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Jeremy G.|title=Television: Critical Methods and Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rWFRLVyvY0C&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=color+television+December+17+1953&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XpTGUdq5JO_A4APivoCoDA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=color%20television%20December%2017%201953&amp;f=false |year=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=9781410614742 |page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 [[Tournament of Roses Parade]]) occurred on January 1, 1954, but over the next dozen years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. In 1956 NBC's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' became the first live network television series to present a majority of episodes in color. CBS's ''[[The Big Record]]'', starring pop vocalist [[Patti Page]], was the first television show broadcast in color for the entire 1957-1958 season; its production costs were greater than most movies were at the time not only because of all the stars featured on the hour-long extravaganza but the extremely high-intensity lighting and electronics required for the new [[RCA TK-41]] cameras. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.

[[NBC]] made the first coast-to-coast color broadcast when it telecast the [[Tournament of Roses Parade]] on January 1, 1954, with public demonstrations given across the United States on prototype color receivers by manufacturers [[RCA]], [[General Electric]], [[Philco]], [[Raytheon]], [[Hallicrafters]], [[Hoffman Television|Hoffman]], [[Pacific Mercury]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;"Television in Review: N.B.C.

Two days earlier Admiral demonstrated to their distributors the prototype of Admiral's first color television set planned for consumer sale using the NTSC standards, priced at $1,175 ({{Inflation|US|1175|1954|fmt=eq}}). It is not known when the later commercial version of this receiver was first sold. Production was extremely limited, and no advertisements for it were published in New York or Washington newspapers.

Early color telecasts could be preserved only on the black-and-white [[kinescope]] process introduced in 1947. It was not until September 1956 that NBC began using color film to time-delay and preserve some of its live color telecasts.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Abramson, ''The History of Television, 1942 to 2000'', McFarland, 2003, p. 74. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1220-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ampex]] introduced a color videotape recorder in 1958, which NBC used to tape ''[[An Evening With Fred Astaire]],'' the oldest surviving network color videotape.  This system was also used to unveil a demonstration of color television for the press. On May 22, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the WRC-TV NBC studios in Washington, D.C. and gave a speech touting the new technology's merits.  His speech was recorded in color, and a copy of this videotape was given to the Library of Congress for posterity.

Several syndicated shows had episodes filmed in color during the 1950s, including ''[[The Cisco Kid]]'', ''[[The Lone Ranger]]'', ''[[My Friend Flicka (TV series)|My Friend Flicka]]'', and ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''. The first two were carried by some stations equipped for color telecasts well before NBC began its regular weekly color dramas in 1959, beginning with the Western series ''[[Bonanza]]''.

NBC was at the forefront of color programming because its parent company RCA manufactured the most successful line of color sets in the 1950s, and by 1959 RCA was the only remaining major manufacturer of color sets.&lt;ref&gt;RCA made about 95 percent of the color television sets sold in the U.S. in 1960. Peter Bart, "Advertising: Color TV Set Output Spurred," ''New York Times'', July 31, 1961, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], which were not affiliated with set manufacturers and were not eager to promote their competitor's product, dragged their feet into color.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=LSMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8 ABC to Go Tint at First Sponsor Nibble]", ''Billboard'', September 4, 1954, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891921-1,00.html Chasing the Rainbow] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724201955/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891921-1,00.html |date=July 24, 2008 }}," ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', June 30, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; CBS broadcast color specials and sometimes aired its big weekly variety shows in color, but it offered no regularly scheduled color programming until the fall of 1965. At least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', was filmed in color beginning in 1963 but continued to be telecast in black and white through the end of the 1964–65 season. ABC delayed its first color programs until 1962, but these were initially only broadcasts of the cartoon shows ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'' and ''[[Beany and Cecil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', and ''[[Beany and Cecil]]''.

Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html RCA-NBC Firsts in Television] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219060637/http://novia.net/~ereitan/rca-nbc_firsts.html |date=December 19, 2008 }}. Jack Gould, "Tinted TV Shows Its Colors," ''New York Times'', November 29, 1964, p. X17.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network, although it did have a television-manufacturing parent company, was in financial decline by 1954 and was dissolved two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke Ingram, [http://www.dumonthistory.tv/7.html The DuMont Television Network, Chapter Seven: Finale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804165205/http://www.dumonthistory.tv/7.html |date=August 4, 2009 }}. The small amount of color programming that DuMont broadcast in 1954–1955 (mostly its show ''Sunday Supplement'') was all from color films.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively small amount of network color programming, combined with the high cost of color television sets, meant that as late as 1964 only 3.1 percent of television households in the U.S. had a color set. But by the mid-1960s, the subject of color programming turned into a ratings war. A 1965 [[Nielsen Audio|ARB]] study that proposed an emerging trend in color television set sales convinced NBC that a full shift to color would gain a ratings advantage over its two competitors.&lt;ref name="tvobscurities.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/color60s/|title=Color Revolution: Television In The Sixties - TVObscurities|author=|date=|website=tvobscurities.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103093236/http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/color60s/|archivedate=January 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, NBC provided the catalyst for rapid color expansion by announcing that its [[1965-66 United States network television schedule|prime time schedule for fall 1965]] would be almost entirely in color.&lt;ref&gt;The exceptions being ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Convoy (TV series)|Convoy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ABC and CBS followed suit and over half of their combined prime-time programming also was in color that season, but they were still reluctant to telecast all their programming in color due to production costs.&lt;ref name="tvobscurities.com"/&gt; All three broadcast networks were airing full color prime time schedules by the [[1966-67 American network television schedule|1966–67 broadcast season]], and ABC aired its last new black-and-white daytime programming in December 1967.&lt;ref&gt;The game show ''Everybody's Talking''. CBS's daytime soap opera ''[[The Secret Storm]]'' was the last network show to switch to color after airing its last black-and-white performance on March 11, 1968, making it the last black-and-white series on commercial network television.  The last black-and-white series on network television was  ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood|MisteRogers' Neighborhood]]'' on the non-commercial [[National Educational Television|NET]].  Production of this series switched over to color in August 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; Public broadcasting networks like [[National Educational Television|NET]], however, did not use color for a majority of their programming until 1968.  The number of color television sets sold in the U.S. did not exceed black-and-white sales until 1972, which was also the first year that more than fifty percent of television households in the U.S. had a color set.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvhistory.tv/facts-stats.htm Television Facts and Statistics – 1939 to 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731144259/http://www.tvhistory.tv/facts-stats.htm |date=July 31, 2008 }}, Television History – The First 75 Years.&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the year that "in color" notices before color television programs ended{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, due to the rise in color television set sales, and color programming having become the norm.

In a display of foresight, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] had filmed many of its earlier shows in color so they were able to be repeated on NBC, and since most of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color, they could now also be telecast in that format. To emphasize the new feature, the series was re-dubbed ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'', which premiered in September 1961, and retained that moniker until 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walt Disney anthology television series]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high-numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color and by the early 1980s, B&amp;W sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s, even those areas switched to color sets.

Color broadcasting in Hawaii started in September 1965, and in Alaska a year later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} One of the last television stations in North America to convert to color, [[WINP-TV|WQEX]] (now WINP-TV) in [[Pittsburgh]], started broadcasting in color on October 16, 1986 after its black-and-white transmitter, which dated from the 1950s, broke down in February 1985 and the parts required to fix it were no longer available. The then-owner of WQEX, [[PBS]] member station [[WQED (TV)|WQED]], diverted some of its pledge money into getting a color transmitter for WQEX.

Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice, they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of [[General Electric|GE's]] relatively compact and lightweight [[Porta-Color]] set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Also in 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.

===Europe===
The first regular colour broadcasts in Europe were by the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[BBC Two|BBC2]] beginning on July 1, 1967 (PAL). [[West Germany]]'s first colour broadcast occurred in August (PAL), followed by the Netherlands in September (PAL), and by France in October (SECAM). Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria, [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and Hungary all started regular colour broadcasts around 1969/1970. Ireland's national TV station [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] began using colour in 1968 for recorded programmes; the first [[outside broadcasting|outside broadcast]] made in colour for RTÉ Television was when Ireland hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971|in Dublin in 1971]].&lt;ref name="RTÉ Archives"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1970s.html|title=THE ADVENT OF COLOUR TELEVISION: 1971|publisher=RTÉ Archives|accessdate=30 April 2013|date=18 April 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204210214/http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1970s.html|archivedate=February 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PAL system spread through most of Western Europe.

More European countries introduced colour television using the PAL system in the 1970s and early 1980s; examples include [[Belgium]] (1971), [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]/[[Serbia]] (1971), [[Spain]] (1972, but not fully implemented until 1978), [[Iceland]] (1973), [[Portugal]] (1975, but not fully implemented until 1980), [[Albania]] (1981), [[Turkey]] (1981) and [[Romania]] (1983, but not fully implemented until 1990). In Italy there were debates to adopt a national colour television system, the ''ISA'', developed by [[Indesit]], but that idea was scrapped. As a result, Italy was one of the last European countries to officially adopt the PAL system in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagine70.com/vmnews/wmview.php?ArtID=650 The adoption of color television in Italy (Italian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229212545/http://www.pagine70.com/vmnews/wmview.php?ArtID=650 |date=February 29, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French colonial empires|France]], Luxembourg, and most of the [[Warsaw Pact|Eastern Bloc]] along with their overseas territories opted for [[SECAM]]. SECAM was a popular choice in countries with much hilly terrain, and technologically backward countries with a very large installed base of monochrome equipment, since the greater ruggedness of the SECAM signal could cope much better with poorly maintained equipment. However, for many countries the decision was more down to politics than technical merit.

A drawback of SECAM for production is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals are not really possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple fade to black is trivial in NTSC and PAL: one merely reduces the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the colour difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that [[comb filter]]ing, allowing better colour separation, is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback in the early days of SECAM as such filters were not readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.

The first regular colour broadcasts in SECAM were started on October 1, 1967, on [[France 2|France's Second Channel (ORTF 2e chaîne)]].
In France and the UK colour broadcasts were made on [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequencies, the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band being used for black and white, 405 lines in UK or 819 lines in France, until the beginning of the 1980s. Countries elsewhere that were already broadcasting 625-line monochrome on VHF and UHF, simply transmitted colour programs on the same channels.

Some British television programs, particularly those made by or for [[ITC Entertainment]], were shot on colour film before the introduction of colour television to the UK, for the purpose of sales to U.S. networks. The first British show to be made in colour was the drama series ''[[The Adventures of Sir Lancelot]]'' (1956–57), which was initially made in black and white but later shot in colour for sale to the [[NBC]] network in the United States. Other British colour television programs include ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' (1964–1965), which was the first British TV show to be filmed entirely in colour, ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' (1965–1966) and ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'' (1967–1968). However, most UK series predominantly made using videotape, such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963–89; 2005–present) did not begin colour production until later, with the first colour ''Doctor Who'' episodes not airing until 1970.

===Asia and the Pacific===
In [[Japan]], [[NHK]] and [[Nippon Television|NTV]] introduced color television, using a variation of the [[NTSC]] system (called [[NTSC-J]]) on September 10, 1960, making it the first country in Asia to introduce color television.  The [[Philippines]] (1966) and [[Taiwan]] (1969) also adopted the [[NTSC]] system.

Other countries in the region instead used the [[PAL]] system, starting with [[Australia]] (1967, originally scheduled for 1972, but not fully implemented until 1975), and then [[Thailand]] (1969; this country converted from a 525-line system to 625 lines), [[Hong Kong]] (1970), the [[People's Republic of China]] (1971), [[New Zealand]] (1973), [[North Korea]] (1974), [[Singapore]] (1974), [[Pakistan]] (1976, but not fully implemented until 1982), [[Kazakhstan]] (1978), [[Vietnam]] (1978), [[Malaysia]] (1978, but not fully implemented until 1980), [[Indonesia]] (1979), [[India]] (1979, but not fully implemented until 1982), and [[Bangladesh]] (1980). [[South Korea]] did not introduce color television (using [[NTSC]]) until 1980 (full-time color transmissions began in 1981), although it was already manufacturing color television sets for export. [[Cambodia]] was the last country in [[Asia]] to introduce color television, officially introduced in 1981 using the PAL system, with full-time color transmissions since 1985.

====Middle East====
Nearly all of the countries in the Middle East use PAL. The first country in the Middle East to introduce color television was Iraq in 1967. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar followed in the mid-1970s, but Israel, Lebanon, and Cyprus continued to broadcast in black and white until the early 1980s. Israeli television even erased the color signals using a device called the [[Television in Israel#The mekhikon|''mekhikon'']].

===Africa===
The first color television service in Africa was introduced on the [[Tanzania]]n island of [[Zanzibar]], in 1973, using PAL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Zanzibar+colour+tv+in+Africa+1973.&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Zanzibar+ ''Mass Media, Towards the Millennium: The South African Handbook of Mass Communication''], Arrie De Beer, J.L. van Schaik, 1998, page 56&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 also, [[Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]] of [[Mauritius]] broadcast the OCAMM Conference, in color, using SECAM. At the time, [[South Africa]] did not have a television service at all, owing to opposition from the [[apartheid]] regime, but in 1976, one was [[Television in South Africa#Introduction of television|finally launched]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/tv-in-south-africa-marks-its-40th-anniversary-20160105 TV in South Africa marks its 40th anniversary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215230324/http://www.channel24.co.za/TV/News/tv-in-south-africa-marks-its-40th-anniversary-20160105 |date=February 15, 2016 }}, [[News24|channel24]], 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigeria]] adopted PAL for color transmissions in 1974 in the then Benue Plateau state in the north central region of the country, but countries such as [[Ghana]] and [[Zimbabwe]] continued with black and white until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=nEsYVfK3MtbWavGogpAO&amp;id=2MhBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=zbc+tv+colour+1984&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Colour+transmission ''A Concise Encyclopedia of Zimbabwe''], Donatus Bonde, Mambo Press, 1988, page 410&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service]] (SLBS) started television broadcasting in 1963 as a cooperation between the SLBS and commercial interests; coverage was extended to all districts in 1978 when the service was also upgraded to color.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgptYdAcsOgC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=sierra%20leone%20broadcasting%20service%20colour%20television&amp;pg=PA173#v=onepage&amp;q=sierra%20leone%20broadcasting%20service%20colour%20television&amp;f=true ''World Broadcasting: A Comparative View''], Alan Wells, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, page 173&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
In contrast to most other countries in the Americas, which had adopted [[NTSC]], Brazil began broadcasting in color using [[PAL-M]]. Its first color transmission was on February 19, 1972. However Ecuador was the first South American country to use [[NTSC]] color. Its first color transmission was on November 5, 1974. In 1978, Argentina started broadcasting in color using [[PAL-N]] in connection with the country's hosting of the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. Some countries in South America, including Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, continued to broadcast in black and white until the early 1980s.

[[Cor Dillen]], director and later [[CEO]] of the South American branch of [[Philips]], was responsible for bringing color television to South America.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Color standards==
There are three main analog [[broadcast television systems]] in use around the world, [[PAL]] (Phase Alternating Line), [[NTSC]] (National Television System Committee), and [[SECAM]] (Séquentiel Couleur à Mémoire—Sequential Color with Memory).

The system used in The Americas and part of the Far East is NTSC. Most of Asia, Western Europe, Australia, Africa, and Eastern South America use PAL (though Brazil uses a hybrid PAL-M system). Eastern Europe and France uses SECAM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paradiso-design.net/TVsystems_worldwide.html World TV standards.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a device (such as a television) can only read or display video encoded to a standard which the device is designed to support; otherwise, the source must be converted (such as when European programs are broadcast in North America or vice versa).

A '''Drawing-in frame''' was a piece of equipment used in the [[cotton industry]]. It was the drawers-in job to thread each of ends on a new beam through the correct healds, and then though the reed. On a Lancashire loom weaving grey cloth this was a simple but time consuming task, but for a complex pattern on a [[Hattersley loom#Jacquard Tapestry Loom|Jacquard tapestry loom]], great care was needed. To do this, the new beam was mounted on the back of a drawing-in frame, the healds were held next in a vertical position, and in front the reed would be clamped. This job was done by a ''reacher-in'' and a ''[[loomer (weaving)|loomer]]''. The reacher-in, who would be young and usually a boy, passed each end in order to the loomer who threaded it through the healds and the reed.{{sfn|Graham|2008|pp=79-82,168}}
[[File:QSMM Drawing-in 2653.JPG|thumb|The healds and reeds.]]

A '''drift meter''', also '''drift indicator''' and '''drift sight''', is an optical device used to improve [[dead reckoning]] for aircraft [[navigation]]. It consists of a small telescope extended vertically through the bottom of the aircraft with the eyepiece inside the fuselage at the navigator's station. A [[reticle]], normally consisting of spaced parallel lines, is rotated until objects on the ground are seen to be moving parallel to the lines. The angle of the reticle then indicates the aircraft's drift angle due to winds aloft, and can be used to calculate the ground speed.

'''Driving simulators''' are used for [[entertainment]] as well as in [[training]] of driver's education courses taught in educational institutions and private businesses. They are also used for [[research]] purposes in the area of human factors and medical research, to monitor driver behavior, performance, and attention and in the car industry to design and evaluate new vehicles or new advanced driver assistance systems.

== Training ==
Driving simulators are being increasingly used for [[training]] drivers all over the world. Research has shown&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, P., &amp; Bellavance, F. (2017). Transfer of Training of Driving Skills Learned on a Driving Simulator to On-Road Driving Behavior. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research 	DOI:10.3141/2660-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, P., Choukou, M-A., &amp; Bellavance, F. (2017). Transfer of Training in Basic Control Skills from a Truck  Simulator to a Real Truck. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research 	Board. Vol. 2637 pp. 67-73. May 2017. DOI: 10.3141/2637-08&lt;/ref&gt; that driving simulators are proven to be excellent practical and effective educational tools to impart safe driving training techniques for all drivers. There are various types of driving simulators that are being used like train simulators, bus simulator, car simulator, truck simulator etc. &lt;!-- This passage does not make logical sense. Were driving simulators "removed" or "moved" in some places "into the hazard perception test", and how does this test "lower the chances of gaining experience", and how does all of the above relate to driving simulation?  --&gt;
[[File:Hindsim.jpg|alt=Driving simulator is the best tool for driving training |thumb|Automobile training simulator for better knowledge of driver's behaviour and understanding of road rules.]]
Manufacturers such Hindustan Simulators. Simworx in Australia, Virage Simulation in Canada, Vertex Research Centre, India, Tecknotrove, Faros Simulation System,  XPI Simulation are active in developing Driver Training Simulators that are relevant to Road Safety as well as immersive Student Driver Training. Hazard Perception and Disability Simulators for training amputees or the disabled in the use of hand controls whilst still abiding with local road rules are one of many features found in their simulators.

=== Uses ===
* Novice driver training and testing
* Professional driver training and testing
* Training in critical driving conditions
* Testing the effects of impairment on driver performance
* Analysis of the driver behaviours
* Analysis of driver responses
* Evaluating user performances in different conditions (handling of controls)
* Assessing fitness to drive for aging drivers

=== Types ===
* '''Ambulance Simulator:''' Used to train and assess ambulance drivers in basic and advanced vehicle control skills as well as how to respond to emergencies and interact with other emergency responders.
* '''Car Simulator:''' Used to train and test novice drivers in all the skills required to pass a driver's license road test as well as hazard perception and crash risk mitigation.
*
* '''Modular-design simulator''': Interchangeable vehicle cabins or cockpits can be configured for use as tractor/trailer trucks, dump trucks and other construction vehicles, airport-operated vehicles, emergency response and police pursuit vehicles, buses, subway trains, passenger vehicles, and heavy equipment such as cranes.

* '''Multi-station driving simulator''': This type of simulator enables one instructor to train more drivers at the same time thus saving time and reducing costs.. These systems are equipped with instructor stations connected to  control several driving simulators.

[[File:Truck sim virage.png|thumb|Example of truck simulators developed by Virage Simulation [&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://viragesimulation.com/vs600m-truck-simulator/ |title=VS600M Truck Driving Simulator by Virage Simulation |last= |first= |date= |work=Virage Simulation Driving Simulator Systems (Car Simulator, Truck Simulator) |access-date=2018-09-05 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;] for Commercial Driver License (CDL) training, fuel efficiency training, defensive driving, skid control, rollover prevention and driver assessment at the Road Transport Training Centre (CFTR) in Mirabel, Canada. ]]

== Entertainment ==
{{Main|Sim racing}}

Advances in processing power have led to more realistic simulators in recent years, beginning with [[Papyrus Design Group]]'s groundbreaking ''[[Grand Prix Legends]]'' for the [[IBM PC compatible|PC]], released in 1998

Occasionally, a [[racing game]] or driving simulator will also include an attachable [[Racing wheel|steering wheel]] that can be used to play the game in place of a [[Game controller|controller]]. The wheel, which is usually plastic, may also include pedals to add to the game's reality. These wheels are usually used only for computer games.

In addition to the myriad commercial releases there is a bustling community of amateur coders working on closed and [[open source]] free simulators. Some of the major features popular with fans of the genre are online [[racing]], realism and diversity of cars and tracks.

Dutch simulator designer [[Cruden BV|Cruden]] offers private use car simulators for personal entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cruden Private Use Simulator |url=http://www.cruden.com/private-use |work=Cruden |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904101932/http://www.cruden.com/private-use |archivedate=2012-09-04 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruden car simulator is not connected to a computer game, system uses the same software that is designed for [[Formula 1]] teams and engineers to improve their skills and their vehicles. The simulator provides different types of settings. Such as; different cars, terrains or any other desired settings. Also, telemetry analyze is available as an optional feature.

== Research ==
Driving simulators are used at research facilities for many purposes.  The Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Toronto use the Virage Simulation VS500M driving simulator to study and measure the effects of cannabis on driving (Alex Ballingall, Toronto Star. Nov. 26, 2015). Many vehicle manufacturers operate driving simulators, e.g. BMW, Ford, Renault.  Many universities also operate simulators for research.  In addition to studying driver training issues, driving simulators allow researchers to study driver behavior under conditions in which it would be illegal and/or unethical to place drivers.  For instance, studies of driver distraction would be dangerous and unethical (because of the inability to obtain informed consent from other drivers) to do on the road.

With the increasing use of various in-vehicle information systems ('''IVIS''') such as satellite navigation systems, cell phones, DVD players and e-mail systems, simulators are playing an important rule in assessing the safety and utility of such devices.

Simulators are also used in psychometric testing, driver behaviour mapping, analysis of driving patterns for driverless car development, etc. Example: Central Road Research Institute and Faros Simulation System have jointly developed a car simulator for extensive research purposes. [http://www.crridom.gov.in/content/design-and-development-car-driving-simulator CRRI Faros Research Simulator]

=== Fidelity ===
There exists a number of types research driving simulators, with a wide range of capabilities. The most complex, like the [[National Advanced Driving Simulator]], have a full-sized vehicle body, with six-axis movement and 360-degree visual displays. On the other end of the range are simple desktop simulators such as the York Driving Simulator that are often implemented using a computer monitor for the visual display and a videogame-type steering wheel and pedal input devices. These low cost simulators are used readily in the evaluation of basic and clinically oriented scientific questions.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Z., &amp; Milgram, P. (2005). An Investigation of the Potential to Influence Braking Behaviour Through Manipulation of Optical Looming Cues in a Simulated Driving Task. Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 49(17), 1540–1544.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, R. W., Ferguson, S. A., Zhou, X., Sargent, C., Darwent, D., Kennaway, D. J., &amp; Roach, G. D. (2012). Time-of-Day Mediates the Influences of Extended Wake and Sleep. Chronobiology International, 29(5): 572–579&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baulk, S. D., Biggs, S. N., Reid, K. J., van den Heuvel, C. J., &amp; Dawson, D. (2008). Chasing the silver bullet: Measuring driver fatigue using simple and complex tasks. Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention, 40(1), 396–402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Telner, J. A., Wiesenthal, D. L., &amp; Bialystok, E. (2009). Video Gamer Advantages in a Cellular Telephone and Driving Task. Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 53(23), 1748–1752.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Telner, J. A. (2008).

The Effects of Donepezil on Computer-Simulated Driving Ability Among Healthy Older Adults: A Pilot Study. Journal of clinical psychopharmacology, 31(5), 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is complicated by political and economic factors, as facilities with low-fidelity simulators claim their systems are "good enough" for the job, while the high-fidelity simulator groups insist that their (considerably more expensive) systems are necessary. Research into motion fidelity indicates that, while some motion is necessary in a research driving simulator, it does not need to have enough range to match real-world forces.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg J., Artz B., Cathey L. The Effect of Lateral Motion Cues During Simulated Driving. ''Driving Simulator Conference North America 2003 Proceedings,'' Dearborn, Michigan, October 8–10, 2003, CD-ROM (ISSN 1546-5071)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research has also considered the use of the real-time photo-realistic video content that reacts dynamically to driver behaviour in the environment.&lt;ref name="heras11driving"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Heras, A.M. |author2=Breckon, T.P. |author3=Tirovic, M. |chapter=Video Re-sampling and Content Re-targeting for Realistic Driving Incident Simulation |title=Proc. 8th European Conference on Visual Media Production |date=November 2011 |pages=sp-2 |url=http://www.durham.ac.uk/toby.breckon/publications/papers/heras11driving.pdf |accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Validity ===
There is a question of validity—whether results obtained in the simulator are applicable to real-world driving.  Given the inability to replicate some simulator studies on the sidewalk this is likely to remain an issue for some time. Some research teams are using automated vehicles to recreate simulator studies on a test track, enabling a more direct comparison between the simulator study and the real world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.its.umn.edu/sensor/2004/winter/track.html Program develops new test track capability] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322091643/http://www.its.umn.edu/sensor/2004/winter/track.html |date=March 22, 2007 }}". ''ITS Sensor''. Winter 2004. Retrieved on February 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As computers have grown faster and simulation is more widespread in the automotive industry, commercial vehicle math models that have been validated by manufacturers are seeing use in simulators. Driving simulators can also be used for the training of Airplane, Train, Tramway and other vehicles drivers. The simulation software can be seen as serious game, and some companies became specialists for the delivery of simulators systems (such as Oktal for instance).

=== Simulator Adaptation Syndrome ("SAS") ===

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

Simulator Adaptation Syndrome ("SAS"), is an issue with all simulators, not just [[driving]] simulators. The main cause of Simulator Adaptation Syndrome are system delays between the driver's command and the response of the simulator. In effect the brain, referencing driving a real vehicle, expects the simulator's response to be the same as a car, the greater the deviation the greater the "adaption burden" on the brain.

If the deviation is large, the driver may experience symptoms of headaches, motion sickness, disorientation, etc. due to SAS although this is very dependent on the individual. Likewise the simulator "cues" also have an effect, that is some individuals will experience discomfort due to a simulator not having motion cues, where others may not have a problem with such simulators. Some individuals will show high tolerance to visual system delays, where others may not.

The "Adaptation" in SAS relates to the brain's accepting these simulator's disparities relative to a real vehicle and thus slowly changing its reference point to that of the simulation. Thus with gradual introduction to the simulator environment the brain will slowly adapt and the negative effects of SAS (headaches, motion sickness, disorientation, etc.) will be greatly reduced. Once a person spends several hours in a driving simulator a real vehicle can evoke SAS again however the adaption time is greatly reduced: the brain quickly "remembers" and "resets" the real vehicle reference point.

As an example of SAS timing, when airline pilots go through regular simulator training they are not allowed to fly an airplane for 1 week in order to allow their brains to "forget" the SAS reference point induced by the simulator.

To sum up, {{According to whom|there is no such thing as "Simulator Sickness"|date=November 2017}}, there is however a physiological response to simulators called "SAS" which can result in headaches, motion sickness, and disorientation. By minimizing the simulator's system delays, rendering all the cues economically possible, and slowly introducing susceptible individuals, the effects of SAS can be mitigated.

The primary reason for the $54 million price tag of the [[National Advanced Driving Simulator]] was to reduce SAS the maximum amount possible. The National Advanced Driving Simulator is capable of rendering, including full motion cues, a driver passing a vehicle on a 2 lane highway from the beginning of the pass to the end (thus its enormous motion base).

== Development ==
Nowadays, driving simulators are not only used for research purposes but are also used in the development process of a vehicle by either the car manufacturers or their suppliers. This is for example the case with the car projectors development: to reduce costs and delays, car projectors are tested with virtual prototypes before any physical prototype is built.

A '''dry box''' is a storage container in which the interior is kept at a low level of humidity. It may be as simple as an airtight and watertight enclosure, or it may use active means to remove water vapor from the air trapped inside.

Dry boxes are used to safely store items that would otherwise be damaged or adversely affected by excessive [[humidity]], such as [[camera]]s and [[Camera lens|lenses]] (to prevent fungal growth), and musical instruments (to prevent humidity induced swelling or shrinkage of wooden instrument parts). They are also used in the storage of [[surface mount]] electronic components prior to [[circuit board]] assembly, to prevent water absorption that could flash into steam during [[soldering]], destroying the part.

== Types ==
=== Desiccant boxes ===
A simple dry box can consist of nothing more than a sealed, airtight box containing a [[desiccant]], such as silica gel or anhydrous calcium chloride. These can be easily built at relatively low cost. However, the humidity level in such boxes cannot be controlled or regulated, owing to the difficulty of gauging the quantity of desiccant required to achieve a certain humidity level. Repeated opening of such boxes, allowing humid ambient air to enter, can saturate the desiccant, and some desiccants can have corrosive or other harmful effects on the contents of the box if they collect enough water to dissolve.

=== Electronic dry boxes ===
Electronic dry boxes contain a small [[Thermoelectric cooling|Peltier cooler]], which removes moisture from the air by condensing it out. A control dial is usually provided that permits the user rough adjustment of the humidity level. More sophisticated designs link the cooler to a settable digital hygrometer, allowing very precise humidity level control.

Another form of electronic dry box technology utilizes multi-porous molecular sieve desiccants to adsorb moisture. This moisture and humidity control technology is renewable without having to replace desiccants. Many electronic dry box manufacturers have utilize or switch to this technology as there are less limitation than the Peltier cooler which is less effective in removing moisture in colder ambient temperatures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29748">'''Foreground detection''' is one of the major tasks in the field of [[Machine vision|computer vision]] and [[image processing]] whose aim is to detect changes in image sequences. '''Background subtraction''' is any technique which allows an image's foreground to be extracted for further processing (object recognition etc.).

Many applications do not need to know everything about the evolution of movement in a video sequence, but only require the information of changes in the scene, because an image's regions of interest are objects (humans, cars, text etc.) in its foreground. After the stage of image preprocessing (which may include [[image denoising]], post processing like morphology etc.) object localisation is required which may make use of this technique.

Detecting foreground to separate these changes taking place in the foreground of the background. It is a set of techniques that typically analyze the video sequences in [[Real time (media)|real time]] and are recorded with a stationary camera.

[[File:Background foreground.tiff|thumb|400px|Background image and foreground image.]]

==Description==
All detection techniques are based on modelling the background of the image, i.e. set the background and detect which changes occur. Defining the background can be very difficult when it contains shapes, shadows, and moving objects. In defining the background it is assumed that the stationary objects could vary in color and intensity over time.

Scenarios where these techniques apply tend to be very diverse. There can be highly variable sequences, such as images with very different lighting, interiors, exteriors, quality, and noise. In addition to processing in real time, systems need to be able to adapt to these changes.

A very good foreground detection system should be able to:
* Develop a background (estimate) model.
* Be robust to lighting changes, repetitive movements (leaves, waves, shadows), and long-term changes.

==Background subtraction==
Background subtraction is a widely used approach for detecting moving objects in videos from static cameras. The rationale in the approach is that of detecting the moving objects from the difference between the current frame and a reference frame, often called "background image", or "background model". Background subtraction is mostly done if the image in question is a part of a video stream. Background subtraction provides important cues for numerous applications in computer vision, for example surveillance tracking or human poses estimation.

Background subtraction is generally based on a static background hypothesis which is often not applicable in real environments. With indoor scenes, reflections or animated images on screens lead to background changes. Similarly, due to wind, rain or illumination changes brought by weather, static backgrounds methods have difficulties with outdoor scenes.
&lt;ref name="Piccardi"&gt;{{cite conference|author=M. Piccardi|title=Background subtraction techniques: a review|conference=IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics|date=October 2004|volume=4|pages=3099–3104|doi=10.1109/icsmc.2004.1400815|url=http://profs.sci.univr.it/~cristanm/teaching/sar_files/lezione4/Piccardi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporal average filter==
[[File:Mediana.tif|thumb|350px|Temporal average filter example]]
The '''temporal average filter''' is a method that was proposed at the Velastin. This system estimates the background model from the [[median]] of all pixels of a number of previous images.
The system uses a buffer with the pixel values of the last frames to update the median for each image.

To model the background, the system examines all images in a given time period called '''training time'''. At this time we only display images and will find the median, pixel by pixel, of all the plots in the background this time.

After the training period for each new frame, each pixel value is compared with the input value of funds previously calculated. If the input pixel is within a threshold, the pixel is considered to match the background model and its value is included in the pixbuf. Otherwise, if the value is outside this threshold pixel is classified as foreground, and not included in the buffer.

This method can not be considered very efficient because they do not present a rigorous statistical basis and requires a buffer that has a high computational cost.

== Conventional approaches==
A robust background subtraction algorithm should be able to handle lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter and long-term scene changes.&lt;ref name="cs.utexas"&gt;{{cite web|author=B. Tamersoy|title=Background Subtraction – Lecture Notes|url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/courses/fall2009/slides/lecture9_background.pdf|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|date=September 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following analyses make use of the function of ''V''(''x'',''y'',''t'') as a video sequence where ''t'' is the time dimension, ''x'' and ''y'' are the pixel location variables. e.g. ''V''(1,2,3) is the pixel intensity at (1,2) pixel location of the image at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 in the video sequence.

=== Using frame differencing ===
A motion detection algorithm begins with the segmentation part where foreground or moving objects are segmented from
the background. The simplest way to implement this is to take an image as background and take the frames obtained at the time
t, denoted by I(t) to compare with the background image denoted by B. Here using simple arithmetic calculations, we can
segment out the objects simply by using image subtraction technique of computer vision meaning for each pixels in I(t), take the
pixel value denoted by P[I(t)] and subtract it with the corresponding pixels at the same position on the background image
denoted as P[B].

In mathematical equation, it is written as:
: &lt;math&gt;P[F(t)]=P[I(t)]-P[B] &lt;/math&gt;

The background is assumed to be the frame at time ''t''. This difference image would only show some intensity for the pixel locations which have changed in the two frames. Though we have seemingly removed the background, this approach will only work for cases where all foreground pixels are moving and all background pixels are static.&lt;ref name="cs.utexas" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Motion Detection"&gt;
{{cite book
|author1=B. Patel |author2=N. Patel | title = Motion Detection based on multi-frame video under surveillance systems
| volume = Vol. 12
| date= March 2012
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A threshold "Threshold" is put on this difference image to improve the subtraction (see Image [[Thresholding (image processing)|thresholding]]).

: &lt;math&gt;|P[F(t)]-P[F(t+1)]|&gt;\mathrm{Threshold} &lt;/math&gt;

This means that the difference image's pixels' intensities are 'thresholded' or filtered on the basis of value of Threshold.

| date= February 2012
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The accuracy of this approach is dependent on speed of movement in the scene. Faster movements may require higher thresholds.

=== Mean filter ===
For calculating the image containing only the background, a series of preceding images are averaged. For calculating the background image at the instant&amp;nbsp;''t'',

: &lt;math&gt;B(x,y,t)={1 \over N} \sum_{i=1}^N V(x,y,t-i)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of preceding images taken for averaging. This averaging refers to averaging corresponding pixels in the given images. ''N'' would depend on the video speed (number of images per second in the video) and the amount of movement in the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Y. Benezeth|author2=B. Emile|author3= H. Laurent|author4= C. Rosenberger|title=Review and evaluation of commonly-implemented background subtraction algorithms|conference=International Conference on Pattern Recognition|date=December 2008|pages=1–4 |doi=10.1109/ICPR.2008.4760998|url=http://www.moivre.usherbrooke.ca/sites/default/files/108.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After calculating the background ''B''(''x'',''y'',''t'') we can then subtract it from the image ''V''(''x'',''y'',''t'') at time ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;t and threshold it. Thus the foreground is

: &lt;math&gt;|V(x,y,t)-B(x,y,t)|&gt; \mathrm{Th} &lt;/math&gt;

where Th is threshold. Similarly we can also use median instead of mean in the above calculation of ''B''(''x'',''y'',''t'').

Usage of global and time-independent thresholds (same Th value for all pixels in the image) may limit the accuracy of the above two approaches.&lt;ref name="cs.utexas" /&gt;

=== Running Gaussian average ===
For this method, Wren et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=C. Wren |author2=A. Azarbayejani |author3=T. Darrell |author4=A. Pentland |title=Pfinder: real-time tracking of the human body |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=July 1997 |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=780–785 |doi=10.1109/34.598236 |url=http://www.cvmt.dk/education/teaching/e06/CVG9/CV/CVG9ExercisePapers/pfinder.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609085400/http://www.cvmt.dk/education/teaching/e06/CVG9/CV/CVG9ExercisePapers/pfinder.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; propose fitting a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian probabilistic density function]] (pdf) on the most recent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; frames. In order to avoid fitting the pdf from scratch at each new frame time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, a running (or on-line cumulative) average is computed.

The pdf of every pixel is characterized by [[mean]] &lt;math&gt; \mu_t &lt;/math&gt; and [[variance]] &lt;span style = "vertical-align: 15%"&gt; &lt;math&gt; \sigma ^ 2_t &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt;. The following is a possible initial condition (assuming that initially every pixel is background):

: &lt;math&gt; \mu_0 = I_0 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_0 = \langle \text{some default value}\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;span style="vertical-align:15%;"&gt; &lt;math&gt; I_t &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt; is the value of the pixel's intensity at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. In order to initialize variance, we can, for example, use the variance in x and y from a small window around each pixel.

Note that background may change over time (e.g. due to illumination changes or non-static background objects). To accommodate for that change, at every frame &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, every pixel's mean and variance must be updated, as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; \mu_t = \rho I_t + (1 - \rho) \mu_ {t-1} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \sigma^2_t = d ^ 2 \rho + (1 - \rho) \sigma ^ 2_ {t-1} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; d = |(I_t-\mu_t)| &lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; determines the size of the temporal window that is used to fit the pdf (usually &lt;math&gt; \rho = 0.01 &lt;/math&gt; ) and &lt;span style="vertical-align:15%;"&gt; &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt; is the Euclidean distance between the mean and the value of the pixel.

[[File:Running gaussian.jpg|thumb|Gaussian distribution for each pixel.]]

We can now classify a pixel as background if its current intensity lies within some [[confidence interval]] of its distribution's mean:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{|(I_t-\mu_t)|}{\sigma_t} &gt; k \longrightarrow \text{foreground}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;  \frac{|(I_t-\mu_t)|}{\sigma_t} \le k \longrightarrow \text{background}&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameter &lt;span style="vertical-align:15%;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;  k &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is a free threshold (usually &lt;span style="vertical-align:15%;"&gt; &lt;math&gt; k = 2.5 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt;). A larger value for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; allows for more dynamic background, while a smaller &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; increases the probability of a transition from background to foreground due to more subtle changes.

In a variant of the method, a pixel's distribution is only updated if it is classified as background. This is to prevent newly introduced foreground objects from fading into the background. The update formula for the mean is changed accordingly:

: &lt;math&gt; \mu_t =M\mu_{t-1} +(1-M)(I_t\rho +(1-\rho)\mu_{t-1})  &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;span Style="vertical-align:15%;"&gt; &lt;math&gt; M = 1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt; when &lt;math&gt; I_t &lt;/math&gt; is considered foreground and &lt;span style = "vertical-align: 15%"&gt; &lt;math&gt; M = 0 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt; otherwise. So when &lt;span style="vertical-align:15%;"&gt; &lt;math&gt; M = 1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/span&gt;, that is, when the pixel is detected as foreground, the mean will stay the same. As a result, a pixel, once it has become foreground, can only become background again when the intensity value gets close to what it was before turning foreground. This method, however, has several issues: It only works if all pixels are initially background pixels (or foreground pixels are annotated as such). Also, it cannot cope with gradual background changes: If a pixel is categorized as foreground for a too long period of time, the background intensity in that location might have changed (because illumination has changed etc.). As a result, once the foreground object is gone, the new background intensity might not be recognized as such anymore.

=== Background mixture models ===
Mixture of Gaussians method approaches by modelling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and uses an on-line approximation to update the model. In this technique, it is assumed that every pixel's intensity values in the video can be modeled using a [[Gaussian mixture model]].&lt;ref name="StaufferGrimson"&gt;{{cite conference|author1=C. Stauffer |author2=W. Grimson |title=Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking|conference=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition|date=August 1999|volume=2|pages=246–252|doi=10.1109/CVPR.1999.784637|url=http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/vsam/Publications/stauffer_cvpr98_track.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple heuristic determines which intensities are most probably of the background. Then the pixels which do not match to these are called the foreground pixels.
Foreground pixels are grouped using 2D [[Connected-component labeling|connected component]] analysis.&lt;ref name="StaufferGrimson" /&gt;

At any time t, a particular pixel (&lt;math&gt;x_0, y_0&lt;/math&gt;)'s history is

: &lt;math&gt;X_1 , \ldots , X_t = \{V (x_0 , y_0 , i) : 1 \leqslant i \leqslant t\} &lt;/math&gt;

This history is modeled by a mixture of ''K'' Gaussian distributions:

: &lt;math&gt;P(X_t) = \sum_{i=1}^K \omega_{i,t} N \left ( X_t \mid \mu_{i,t} , \Sigma_{i,t} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;N \left (X_t \mid \mu_{it}, \Sigma_{i,t} \right ) = \dfrac{1}{(2\pi)^{D/2}} { 1 \over |\Sigma_{i,t}|^{1/2}} \exp\left(-{ 1 \over 2 }( X_t -\mu_{i,t} )^T \Sigma_{i,t}^{-1} \left (X_t -\mu_{i,t} \right )\right)&lt;/math&gt;

First, each pixel is characterized by its intensity in RGB color space. Then probability of observing the current pixel is given by the following formula in the multidimensional case

:&lt;math&gt;P(X_t) = \sum_{i=1}^K \omega_{i,t} \eta\left ( X_t \,\mu_{i,t} , \Sigma_{i,t} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Where K is the number of distributions, ω is a weight associated to the ith Gaussian at time t and µ, Σ are the mean and standard deviation of said Gaussian respectively.

:&lt;math&gt;\eta\left ( X_t \,\mu_{i,t} , \Sigma_{i,t} \right )=\dfrac{1}{(2/pi)^{n/2}\Sigma_{i,t}^{0.5}}\exp\left(-{1\over 2}(X_t-\mu_{i,t})\Sigma_{i,t}\left(X_t-\mu_{i,t}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Once the parameters initialization is made, a first foreground detection can be made then the parameters are updated. The first B Gaussian distribution which exceeds the threshold ''T'' is retained for a background distribution

:&lt;math&gt;B=\operatorname{argmin}\left(\Sigma_{i-1}^B\omega_{i,t} &gt;T\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The other distributions are considered to represent a foreground distribution. Then, when the new frame incomes at times &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;, a match test is made of each pixel.  A pixel matches a Gaussian distribution if the Mahalanobis distance

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\left(X_{t+1}-\mu_{t+1}\right)^T \Sigma_{i-1}^b\left(X_{t+1}-\mu_{t+1}\right)\right)^{0.5} &lt;k\cdot\sigma_{i,t}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is a constant threshold equal to &lt;math&gt;2.5&lt;/math&gt;.Then, two cases can occur:

Case 1: A match is found with one of the ''k'' Gaussians. For the matched component, the update is done as follows&lt;ref name="Bouwmans"&gt;{{cite journal|author=T. Bouwmans|author2= F. El Baf|author3= B. Vachon|title=Background Modeling using Mixture of Gaussians for Foreground Detection – A Survey|journal=Recent Patents on Computer Science|date=November 2008|volume=1|pages=219–237|url=https://www.academia.edu/691072/Background_modeling_using_mixture_of_gaussians_for_foreground_detection_A_survey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i,t+1}^2=\left(1-\rho\right)\sigma_{i,t}^2+\rho\left(X_{x+1}-\mu_{x+1} \right) \left(X_{x+1}-\mu_{x+1}\right)^T&lt;/math&gt;

Power and Schoonees [3] used the same algorithm to segment the foreground of the image

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{i,t+1}=\left(1-\alpha\right)\omega_{i,t}+\alpha P\left(k\mid X_t, \varphi \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The essential approximation to &lt;math&gt;P\left(k\mid\ X_t,\varphi\right)&lt;/math&gt;  is given by &lt;math&gt; M_{k,t}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="P. Wayne Power"&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. Power|author2= J. Schoonees|title=Understanding Background Mixture Models for Foreground Segmentation|journal=Proceedings Image and Vision Computing New Zealand 2002
|date=2002|pages=267–271|url=http://www.cse.psu.edu/~rcollins/CSE586Spring2010/papers/emBGsubtractAboutSandG.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{k,t}= \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{match}, \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Case 2: No match is found with any of the &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; Gaussians. In this case, the least probable distribution &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with a new one with parameters

:&lt;math&gt;k_{i.t}= \text{low prior weight}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,t+1}=X_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2_{i.t+1}= \text{large initial variance}&lt;/math&gt;

Once the parameter maintenance is made, foreground detection can be made and so on. An on-line [[K-means]] approximation is used to update the Gaussians. Numerous improvements of this original method developed by Stauffer and Grimson &lt;ref name="StaufferGrimson" /&gt;  have been proposed and a complete survey can be found in Bouwmans et al.&lt;ref name="Bouwmans"&gt;{{cite journal|author=T.

{{Well logging}}
[[File:Gama Ray Log.GIF|thumb|right|Example gamma ray log. Blue and black lines indicate the measured gamma rays. Sand section of interest is located at bottom of log where the log moves to the left.]]
'''Gamma ray logging''' is a method of measuring naturally occurring [[gamma radiation]] to characterize the rock or sediment in a [[borehole]] or drill hole.  It is a wireline logging method used in mining, mineral exploration, water-well drilling, for [[formation evaluation]] in oil and gas well drilling and for other related purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slb.com/services/evaluation/wireline_open_hole/petrophysics/gamma_ray/gamma_ray_tools.aspx GR-Logging Tools] by Schlumberger for the Oil and Gas Industry&lt;/ref&gt;  Different types of rock emit different amounts and different spectra of natural [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]].  In particular, [[shale]]s usually emit more gamma rays than other sedimentary rocks, such as [[sandstone]], [[gypsum]], [[halite|salt]], [[coal]], [[dolomite]], or [[limestone]] because radioactive potassium is a common component in their clay content, and because the [[cation exchange capacity]] of clay causes them to adsorb [[uranium]] and [[thorium]].  This difference in radioactivity between shales and sandstones/carbonate rocks allows the gamma ray tool to distinguish between shales and non-shales. But it cannot distinguish between carbonates and sandstone as they both have similar deflections on the gamma ray log. Thus gamma ray logs cannot be said to make good lithological logs by themselves, but in practice, gamma ray logs are compared side-by-side with stratigraphic logs.  

The gamma ray log, like other types of [[well logging]], is done by lowering an instrument down the drill hole and recording gamma radiation variation with depth.  In the [[United States]], the device most commonly records measurements at 1/2-foot intervals.  Gamma radiation is usually recorded in [[American_Petroleum_Institute#Standards_and_certification|API unit]]s, a measurement originated by the petroleum industry.  Gamma rays attenuate according to the diameter of the borehole mainly because of the properties of the fluid filling the borehole, but because gamma logs are generally used in a qualitative way, amplitude corrections are usually not necessary. 

Three elements and their decay chains are responsible for the radiation emitted by rock: [[potassium]], [[thorium]] and [[uranium]].  Shales often contain potassium as part of their clay content and tend to adsorb uranium and thorium as well.  A common gamma-ray log records the total radiation and cannot distinguish between the radioactive elements, while a spectral gamma ray log (see below) can.

For standard gamma-ray logs, the measured value of gamma-ray radiation is calculated from concentration of uranium in ppm, thorium in ppm, and potassium in weight percent: e.g., GR API = 8 × uranium concentration in ppm + 4 × thorium concentration in ppm + 16 × potassium concentration in weight percent. Due to the weighted nature of uranium concentration in the GR API calculation, anomalous concentrations of uranium can cause clean sand reservoirs to appear shaley. For this reason, spectral gamma ray is used to provide an individual reading for each element so that anomalous concentrations can be found and properly interpreted.

An advantage of the gamma log over some other types of well logs is that it works through the steel and cement walls of cased boreholes.  Although concrete and steel absorb some of the gamma radiation, enough travels through the steel and cement to allow for qualitative determinations. 

In some places, non-shales exhibit elevated levels of gamma radiation.  For instance, sandstones can contain uranium minerals, potassium [[feldspar]], clay filling, or lithic fragments that cause the rock to have higher than usual gamma readings.  [[Coal]] and [[dolomite]] may contain adsorbed uranium.  [[Evaporites|Evaporite]] deposits may contain potassium minerals such as [[sylvite]] and [[carnallite]].  When this is the case, spectral gamma ray logging should be done to identify the source of these anomalies.

==Spectral logging==
Spectral logging is the technique of measuring the spectrum, or number and energy, of gamma rays emitted via natural radioactivity of the rock formation. There are three main sources of natural radioactivity on Earth: potassium (40K), thorium (principally 232Th and 230Th), and uranium (principally 238U and 235U). These radioactive isotopes each emit gamma rays that have a characteristic energy level measured in MeV. The quantity and energy of these gamma rays can be measured by a scintillometer. A log of the spectroscopic response to natural gamma ray radiation is usually presented as a total gamma ray log that plots the weight fraction of potassium (%), thorium (ppm) and uranium (ppm). The primary standards for the weight fractions are geological formations with known quantities of the three isotopes. Natural gamma ray spectroscopy logs became routinely used in the early 1970s, although they had been studied from the 1950s.

The characteristic gamma ray line that is associated with each radioactive component:

* Potassium : Gamma ray energy 1.46 [[MeV]]
* Thorium series: Gamma ray energy  2.61 MeV
* Uranium-Radium series: Gamma ray energy 1.76 MeV

Another example of the use of spectral gamma ray logs is to identify specific clay types, like [[kaolinite]] or [[illite]]. This may be useful for interpreting the environment of deposition as kaolinite can form from [[feldspars]] in tropical soils by leaching of potassium; and low potassium readings may thus indicate the presence of one or more [[paleosols]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epgeology.com/sequence-stratigraphy-f20/fluvial-sequence-stratigraphy-using-thorium-potassium-t461.html Fluvial Sequence Stratigraphy using Thorium &amp; Potassium] on [http://www.epgeology.com/ E&amp;P geology]&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of specific clay minerals is also useful for calculating the effective porosity of reservoir rock.

==Use in mineral exploration==
Gamma ray logs are also used in mineral exploration, especially exploration for phosphates, [[uranium]], and [[potassium]] salts.

'''Ghodganga Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd''' is an establishment set up around 70&amp;nbsp;km east to [[Pune]]. Factory is recently named after founder  '''Raosahebdada Pawar Ghodganga Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd''' (RPGSSKL). This project turned out to be the best achievement of [[Cooperative sugar factories and rural development]]. This set up is being conducive as sugar production is prime business for region. The project brings employment and social development.  Sugarcane grower/farmers in the region are really encouraged by the establishment. The project started with capital share of local farmers.

==History==
After the outstanding achievements of [[Cooperative sugar factories and rural development]] set up in [[Maharashtra]] state. The establishment was started with the capital shares of local farmers, [[Pune District Central Cooperative Bank]] and perpetual support by Raosahebdada Pawar on 16 May 1990 with of 2500 TCD crushing capacity . Cooperative movement for sugar industry started in 1960s in Maharashtra with announcement of the potential 12 places in the states where sugar factories could be established. Then called Bombay state government announced a capital share of Indian Rupee 1&amp;nbsp;million, for the cooperatives societies to come forward for establishing sugar factories at these potential 12 places. A central committee was formed by Bombay State Cooperative Bank under the chairmanship. Factory caters to the almost [[Shirur, Maharashtra]] sugarcane growers &amp; interstate too. This is prominently conducive to the local region.

==Harvesting==
Harvesting of sugarcane is done with the help of machine and for this bank also provided the fund to farmers. Currently factory has owned four harvester machines. Taking into account scarcity of workers in future factory has taken this initiative.

==Sugarcane development programme==
For increasing production of sugarcane factory provides guidance, field work training to the farmers. In last year factory appointed officials from research centre to do this work. This implementation is followed &amp; monitored completely.

==Power unit==
Raosahebdada Pawar Ghodganga Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd, which had set up a co-generation power unit at Shirur in Pune district of Maharashtra.The [[Bagasse]] based power unit with a capacity of 20 MW is expected to entail a cost of Rs 2&amp;nbsp;billion. The power project raised request to upgrade capacity to 20.5 MW. This Project is economically strong by converting its own waste in useful
product and power generation. The pollution generated from this unit can be successfully managed through EMP implementation or in fact 
n be converted to useful irrigation water with nutrients and Electricity. This project justifies as to curb Electricity issue &amp; wastage of cane trash &amp; [[Bagasse]] lead to environment risk.

==Breweries and distilleries==

The Raosahebdada Pawar Ghodganga Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd to set up distilleries at their existing set up with [[Indian Rupees|INR]] 99.5&amp;nbsp;million approximately [[United States dollar|USD]] 15.5 Million. The project involves setting up to 30 KLPD [[Molasses]] based distillery unit for production of 30 KLPD of rectified spirit of 27 KLPD of Extra Neutral Alcohol of 27.5 KLPD absolute Alcohol.
The project have proposed to establish distillery unit within same premises adopting continuous fermentation process

==Awards==
Factory stands ahead in the queue from the first couple of years of its establishment.

The project achieved Best Cooperative sugar factory award on its fourth year.

Establishment set itself at First position on [[Maharashtra Energy Development Agency]] award for year 2012–13 in Sugar Cooperative category

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6787">'''GravityLight''' is a [[Mechanically powered flashlight|gravity-powered lamp]] designed by the company Deciwatt for use in [[developing world|developing]] or [[third-world]] nations, as a replacement for [[kerosene lamp]]s. It uses a bag filled with rocks or earth, attached to a cord, which slowly descends similar to the weight drive in a [[cuckoo clock]].

== History==
An early Gravity Light concept was developed concurrently by Clay Moulton and also by Mike Wofsey as part of his Ph.D. in applied physics from the University of Alabama in 2006.&lt;ref name="MS" /&gt; While Moulton did not reportedly develop a prototype, Wofsey did develop a rudimentary prototype that used a custom-machined rare earth magnet motor with minimal gearing. Wofsey secured the www.gravitylight.com domain to disseminate the findings, however he did not pursue the gravity light as he decided the efficiency was too low to be commercially viable. The theoretical efficiency of the device is limited by the simple potential energy in raising a mass to a specified height, and then dividing by the time that the lamp is desired to stay lit. So even a relatively large mass of 10&amp;nbsp;kg, raised to 1 meter, produces a maximum available energy of about 98 joules. When divided by just 5 minutes of light, this returns a usable power of 0.32 watts at an unrealistic 100% efficiency, and only 0.16 watts at 50% total conversion efficiency, which was close to the efficiency of the University of Alabama prototype. At 5.5 operating voltage of an LED, that left only 20 milliamperes for the LED. This is sufficient to light an LED, but the available light from the LED would not likely be useful for reading or night activities. A modification to this approach was suggested where the power draw can be adjusted by the user to trade illumination brightness for illumination time.

== Funding and development==
The first [[IndieGoGo]] campaign of GravityLight was ended on January 18, 2013 with $399,590 funded by 6219 funders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gravitylight-lighting-for-developing-countries|title=GravityLight: lighting for developing countries|publisher=Indiegogo|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second IndieGoGo campaign, GravityLight 2: Made in Africa ended on July 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gravitylight-2-made-in-africa#/|title=GravityLight 2: Made in Africa|publisher=Indiegogo|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured an improved design and the goal of manufacturing them in Kenya.

Martin Riddiford and Jim Reeves worked on GravityLight as a side project for four years.&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoaxes.org/weblog/comments/gravity_lamp|title=|author=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
There are no operating costs after the initial purchase of the appliance. A standard GravityLight kit comes with an adjustable lamp and a ballast bag. The light can be turned on by filling the bag with approximately 20 pounds weight&lt;ref name=FB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2013/01/02/gravitylight-5-lamp-powered-by-gravity/|title=A $5 Lamp Can Change The World - GravityLight|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (10&amp;nbsp;kg) and lifting it up to the base of the device; the weight falls over a period of 25 minutes, pulling a cord/strap that spins gears and drives an electric generator, which continuously powers an [[LED]].&lt;ref name=PS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/bown/2013/product/deciwatt-gravitylight|title=Deciwatt GravityLight|publisher=PopSci|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates enough energy to last 25 minutes whenever it is needed.&lt;ref name=MS/&gt;

The second model, GL02, also includes two SatLights and connecting cables. These are separate lights that are wired in series from the main GravityLight unit. Each SatLight can be turned on or off separately. When used with SatLights, the light on the main unit can be turned on or off. Up to 4 SatLights can be connected, giving extra light to different locations in the house. The rate of the bag drop is almost not affected by the number of SatLights attached.

The original GravityLight used a strap for pulling up the weight. The improved GL02 used a plastic-bead chain on a pulley system. The pulley system requires less strength to pull up.

== In the media ==
GravityLight was called one of ''The 25 Best Inventions of the Year 2013'' by Time Magazine.&lt;ref name=TM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techland.time.com/2013/11/14/the-25-best-inventions-of-the-year-2013/slide/the-gravitylight/#ixzz2tVTBLVXI|title=The 25 Best Inventions of the Year 2013|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans Arvid Hammarskiöld''' (17 May 1925&amp;nbsp;– 12 November 2012) was a Swedish professional [[photographer]]. He was active in most genres—for many years he worked as an industrial photographer, but was especially noted for his portraits.

==Career==
Hammarskiöld was born in 1925 in [[Stockholm]]. His breakthrough as a professional photographer came in the 1950s when he worked all over the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} In 1955 his work, along with that of his wife [[Caroline Hebbe|Caroline Hebbe,]] was selected by [[Edward Steichen]]&lt;ref&gt;Kristen Gresh (2005) The European roots of The Family of Man, ''History of Photography'', 29:4, 331-343, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2005.10442815&lt;/ref&gt; for the world-touring [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibition and book [[The Family of Man]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Steichen, Edward | author2=Steichen, Edward, 1879-1973, (organizer.) | author3=Sandburg, Carl, 1878-1967, (writer of foreword.) | author4=Norman, Dorothy, 1905-1997, (writer of added text.) | author5=Lionni, Leo, 1910-1999, (book designer.) | author6=Mason, Jerry, (editor.) | author7=Stoller, Ezra, (photographer.) | author8=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.) | title=The family of man : the photographic exhibition | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Published for the Museum of Modern Art by Simon and Schuster in collaboration with the Maco Magazine Corporation | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10809600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; seen by 9 million visitors. For some years he was employed by the British ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.

Hammarskiöld was the last surviving member of the group ''Tio fotografer'' (Ten Photographers), which formed in 1958 and was influential in Swedish photography for decades as the illustrations agency ''Tiofoto''. The group included Sten Didrik Bellander (1921–2001), Harry Dittmar, Sven Gillsäter (1921–2001), [[Rune Hassner]] (1928–2003), Hans Malmberg (1927-1977), [[Pål-Nils Nilsson]] (1929–2002), [[Georg Oddner]] (1923-2007), and Lennart Olson (1925–2010).

==Recognition==
In 2009, a selection of seventy of Hammarskiöld's portraits was on display at the [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum in Stockholm]]. 

His portraits were later donated to the [[National Portrait Gallery (Sweden)|National Swedish Portrait Gallery]]. 

== Death ==
Hammarskiöld died in 2012 in [[Lidingö]], east of Stockholm, after a short illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/fotografen-hans-hammarskiold-dod Fotografen Hans Hammarskiöld död]'', Dagens Nyheter, November 13, 2012.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''head transplant''' is an experimental [[surgery|surgical operation]] involving the grafting of one organism's head onto the body of another; in many experiments the recipient's head was not removed but in others it has been. Experimentation in animals began in the early 1900s. {{as of|2018}}, no durable success have been achieved.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lamba|first1=N|last2=Holsgrove|first2=D|last3=Broekman|first3=ML|title=The history of head transplantation: a review.|journal=Acta Neurochirurgica|date=December 2016|volume=158|issue=12|pages=2239–2247|doi=10.1007/s00701-016-2984-0|pmid=27738901|pmc=5116034}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt;

==Medical challenges==
There are three main technical challenges. As with any [[organ transplant]], managing the immune response to avoid [[transplant rejection]] is necessary. Also, the brain is highly dependent on [[perfusion|continuous flow of blood]] to provide oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products, with damage setting in quickly at normal temperatures when [[ischemia|blood flow is cut off]]. Finally, managing the [[nervous system]]s in both the body and the head is essential, in several ways. The [[autonomic nervous system]] controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the [[brain stem]]; if the recipient body's head is removed this can no longer function. Additionally each [[nerve]] coming out of the head via the spinal cord needs to be [[Epineurial repair|connected]] to the putatively corresponding nerve in the recipient body's spinal cord in order for the brain to control movement and receive sensory information. Finally, the risk of systematic [[neuropathic pain]] is high and {{as of|2017|lc=y}} had largely been unaddressed in research.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;

Of these challenges, dealing with blood supply and transplant rejection have been addressed in the field of transplant medicine generally, making transplantation of several types of organs fairly routine;&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt; however {{as of|2017|lc=y}} in a field as common as [[liver transplantation]] around a quarter of organs are rejected within the first year and overall mortality is still much higher than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muduma|first1=G|last2=Saunders|first2=R|last3=Odeyemi|first3=I|last4=Pollock|first4=RF|title=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Tacrolimus versus Ciclosporin as Primary Immunosuppression After Liver Transplant.|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2016|volume=11|issue=11|pages=e0160421|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0160421|pmid=27812112|pmc=5094765}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of grafting the nervous system remained in early stages of research {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-61478-0004, Kopftransplantation durch Physiologen Demichow.jpg|thumb|Transplantation of a dog-head performed in the [[GDR]] by Vladimir Demikhov on January 13, 1959]]

[[Alexis Carrel]] was a French surgeon who had developed improved surgical methods to [[Circulatory anastomosis|connect blood vessels]] in the context of [[organ transplantation]]. In 1908 he collaborated with the American [[Charles Claude Guthrie]] to attempt to graft the head of one dog on an intact second dog; the grafted head showed some reflexes early on but deteriorated quickly and the animal was killed after a few hours.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;&lt;ref name = "stiffy"&gt;{{cite book| last =Roach| first =Mary| date = 2004| title = Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Co.| isbn = 978-0393324822| pages = 206–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrel's work on organ transplantation later earned a Nobel Prize; Guthrie was probably excluded because of this controversial work on head transplantation.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furr|first1=A|last2=Hardy|first2=MA|last3=Barret|first3=JP|last4=Barker|first4=JH|title=Surgical, ethical, and psychosocial considerations in human head transplantation.|journal=International Journal of Surgery (London, England)|date=May 2017|volume=41|pages=190–195|doi=10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.01.077|pmid=28110028|pmc=5490488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Vladimir Demikhov]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] surgeon who had done important work to improve [[coronary bypass surgery]], performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog's head and upper body including the front legs, onto another dog; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems. The dogs generally survived a few days; one survived 29 days. The grafted body parts were able to move and react to stimulus. The animals died due to [[transplant rejection]].&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;

In the 1950s and '60s [[immunosuppressive drug]]s were developed and [[organ transplantation]] techniques were developed that eventually made transplantation of kidneys, livers, and other organs standard medical procedures.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;

In 1965 [[Robert J. White]] did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs, to learn how to manage this challenge. He monitored brain activity with EEG and also monitored [[metabolism]], and showed that he could maintain high levels of brain activity and metabolism by avoiding any break in the blood supply. The animals survived between 6 hours and 2 days. In 1970 he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems. White used [[Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest|deep hypothermia]] to protect the brains during the times when they were cut off from blood during procedure. The recipient bodies had to be kept alive with mechanical ventilation and drugs to stimulate the heart. The grafted heads were able to function - the [[Eye movement|eyes tracked]] moving objects and it could chew and swallow. There were problems with the grafting of blood vessels that led to blood clots forming, and White used high doses of immunosuppressive drugs that had severe side effects; the animals died between 6 hours and 3 days after the heads were engrafted.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt; These experiments were reported and criticized in the media and were considered barbaric by animal rights activists.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt; There were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt;

In 2012 [[Xiaoping Ren]] published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse's body; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;

In 2013 [[Sergio Canavero]] published a protocol that he said would make human head transplantation possible.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{cite news|title=Sergio Canavero: Will His Head Transplants Roll? - Neuroskeptic|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2017/05/13/canavero-head-transplants/|work=Neuroskeptic|date=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Canavero|first1=S|title=HEAVEN: The head anastomosis venture Project outline for the first human head transplantation with spinal linkage (GEMINI).|journal=Surgical Neurology International|date=2013|volume=4|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S335–42|pmid=24244881|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.113444|pmc=3821155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Ren published work in which he cut off the heads of mice but left the brain stem in place, and then connected the vasculature of the donor head to the recipient body; this work was an effort to address whether it was possible to keep the body of the recipient animal alive without life support. All prior experimental work that involved removing the recipient body's head had cut the head off lower down, just below [[Axis (anatomy)|the second bone in the spinal column]]. Ren also used [[Targeted temperature management|moderate hypothermia]] to protect the brains during the procedure.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;

In 2016 Ren and Canavero published a review of attempted as well as possible neuroprotection strategies that they said should be researched for potential use in a head transplantation procedure; they discussed various protocols for connecting the vasculature, the use of various levels of hypothermia, the use of [[blood substitutes]], and the possibility of using [[hydrogen sulfide]] as a neuroprotective agent.&lt;ref name=Lamba2017rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ren|first1=X|last2=Orlova|first2=EV|last3=Maevsky|first3=EI|last4=Bonicalzi|first4=V|last5=Canavero|first5=S|title=Brain protection during cephalosomatic anastomosis.|journal=Surgery|date=July 2016|volume=160|issue=1|pages=5–10|doi=10.1016/j.surg.2016.01.026|pmid=27143608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and popular opinion==
[[Arthur Caplan]], a [[bioethicist]], has written "Head transplants are fake news. Those who promote such claims and who would subject any human being to unproven cruel surgery merit not headlines but only contempt and condemnation."&lt;ref name=caplan&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Chicago Trubune |author=Albert Caplan |title=Promise of world's first head transplant is truly fake news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/commentary/ct-perspec-head-transplant-ethics-1215-story.html |date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert J. White|White]] became a target for protestors because of his head transplantation experiments. One interrupted a banquet in his honor by offering him a bloody replica of a human head. Others called his house asking for "Dr. Butcher". When White testified in a civil hearing about Dr. [[Sam Sheppard]]'s murder case, lawyer [[Terry Gilbert]] compared Dr. White to Dr. [[Frankenstein]].&lt;ref name="death"&gt;[[Grant Segall]], [http://www.cleveland.com/obituaries/index.ssf/2010/09/dr_robert_j_white_was_a_world-.html Dr. Robert J. White, famous neurosurgeron and ethicist, dies at 84], ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', (September 16, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] described White's experiments as "epitomizing the crude, cruel vivisection industry".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Carla Bennett, [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/26/opinion/l-cruel-and-unneeded-324295.html Cruel and Unneeded], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], (August 21, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the field of transplantation medicine has been met with resistance and alarm from some quarters as advances have been made; [[Joseph Murray]], who performed the first kidney transplant in 1954, was described as doing something [[Appeal to nature|unnatural]] or as playing God. These continued as other organs were transplanted, but perhaps became the most sharp as [[hand transplant]]s and [[face transplants]] emerged in 1998 and 2005, as each of these are visible, personal, and social in ways that internal organs are not.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt; The [[medical ethics]] of each of these procedures was extensively discussed and worked out before clinical experimental and regular usage began.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt;

With regard to head transplantation, there had been little formal ethical discussion published in the literature and little dialogue among stakeholders {{as of|2017|lc=y}}; the plans of Canavero were running well ahead of society's and the medical establishment's readiness or acceptance.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt; There was no accepted protocol for conducting the procedure to justify the risk to the people involved, methods of obtaining [[informed consent]] were unclear, especially for the person whose body would be used; issues of desperation render the truly informed consent of a head donor questionable.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt; With regard to societal costs, the body of a person willing to be an [[organ donor]] can save the lives of many people, and {{as of|2017|lc=y}} the supply of tissues and organs from people willing to be organ donors did not meet the medical need of recipients; the notion of an entire donor body going to one other person was difficult to justify at that time.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt; Basic legal issues were also unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}} with regard to whether only one or both of the people involved in a head transplantation would have any legal rights in the post-procedure person.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt;

The most appropriate initial form of the procedure was unclear {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time, the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body, leaving the person completely paralyzed, with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt;

The psychological results of the procedure were unclear as well. While concerns were raised about whether recipients of a face transplant and their social circle would have difficulty adjusting, studies {{as of|2017|lc=y}} had found that disruptions had been minimal. But no transplant had ever been performed where the entire body of an individual is unfamiliar at the conclusion of the procedure, and one of the few documents discussing the ethics in the biomedical literature, a letter to the editor of a journal published in 2015, foresaw a high risk of insanity as a result of the procedure.&lt;ref name=Furr2017rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cartolovni|first1=Anto|last2=Spagnolo|first2=AntonioG|title=Ethical considerations regarding head transplantation|journal=Surgical Neurology International|date=2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=103|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.158785|pmid=26110084|pmc=4476134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular opinion about Canavero's plans for head transplantation had been generally negative {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22530103.700-first-human-head-transplant-could-happen-in-two-years.html?page=2|title=First human head transplant could happen in two years|author=Helen Thomson|work=New Scientist|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these criticisms focus on the state of technology and the timeframe in which Canavero says he will be able to successfully conduct the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fecht|first=Sarah|title=BNo, human head transplants will not be possible by 2017|url=http://www.popsci.com/no-human-head-transplants-will-not-be-possible-2017|accessdate=March 6, 2015|newspaper=Popular Science|date=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/27031329/man-volunteers-for-world-first-head-transplant-operation/|title=Man volunteers for world first head transplant operation|publisher=|access-date=April 10, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410010522/https://au.news.yahoo.com/technology/a/27031329/man-volunteers-for-world-first-head-transplant-operation/|archive-date=April 10, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Herbert Akroyd Stuart.jpg|thumb|250px|Herbert Akroyd Stuart (1864 - 1927) - Inventor of the hot bulb heavy oil engine]]
'''Herbert Akroyd-Stuart''' (28 January 1864, [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]], [[England]] – 19 February 1927, Halifax) was an English inventor who is noted for his invention of the [[hot bulb engine]], or [[heavy oil engine]].

==Life==
Akroyd-Stuart had lived in [[Australia]] in his early years. He was educated at [[St. Bartholomew's School|Newbury Grammar School]] (now [[St. Bartholomew's School]]) and [[City and Guilds of London Institute|Finsbury Technical College]] on Cowper Street. He was the son of Charles Stuart, founder of the Bletchley Iron and Tinplate Works, and joined his father in the business in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Oil engines==
In 1885, Akroyd Stuart accidentally spilt [[Kerosene|paraffin oil]] (kerosene) into a pot of molten [[tin]]. The paraffin oil vaporised and caught fire when in contact with a [[Kerosene lamp|paraffin lamp]]. This gave him an idea to pursue the possibility of using paraffin oil (very similar to modern-day [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]) for an engine, which unlike [[Gasoline|petrol]] would be difficult to be vaporised in a carburettor as its [[Volatility (physics)|volatility]] is not sufficient to allow this.

His first prototype engines were built in 1886. In 1890, in collaboration with Charles Richard Binney,  he filed Patent 7146 for [[Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons|Richard Hornsby and Sons]] of [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], England. The patent was entitled: ''"Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air"''.&lt;ref name="aoi"&gt;{{cite web

===Hornsby-Akroyd engine===
[[Image:Hornsby Akroyd lamp oil engine no.10171 of 1905 at GDSF 08.jpg|thumb|right|A Hornsby-Akroyd engine working at the [[Great Dorset Steam Fair]] ]]
Akroyd-Stuart's engines were built from 26 June 1891 by [[Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons|Richard Hornsby and Sons]] as the ''Hornsby Akroyd Patent Oil Engine'' under licence and were first sold commercially on 8 July 1892. It was the first internal combustion engine to use a pressurised [[fuel injection]] system.&lt;ref name=rwallis&gt;{{cite book | last = Ransome-Wallis | first = Patrick | authorlink =  | title = Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Railway Locomotives | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 2001 | location = | pages = 27 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-486-41247-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hornsby-Akroyd engine used a comparatively low compression ratio, so that the temperature of the air compressed in the combustion chamber at the end of the compression stroke was not high enough to initiate combustion. Combustion instead took place in a separated combustion chamber, the "vaporizer" (also called the "hot bulb") mounted on the cylinder head, into which fuel was sprayed. It was connected to the cylinder by a narrow passage and was heated either by the cylinder's coolant or by exhaust gases while running; an external flame such as a blowtorch was used for starting. Self-ignition occurred from contact between the fuel-air mixture and the hot walls of the vaporizer.&lt;ref name=mcneil&gt;{{cite book | last = McNeil | first = Ian | authorlink = | title = An Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1990 | location = | pages = 310–311 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-415-01306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contracting the bulb to a very narrow neck where it attached to the cylinder, a high degree of turbulence was set up as the ignited gases flashed through the neck into the cylinder, where combustion was completed. As the engine's load increased, so did the temperature of the bulb, causing the ignition period to advance; to counteract pre-ignition, water was dripped into the air intake.&lt;ref name=wrangham&gt;{{cite book | last = Wrangham | first = D.A. | authorlink = | title = The Theory &amp; Practice of Heat Engines | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1956 | location = | pages = 664 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot bulb engines were produced until the late 1920s, often being called "semi-diesels", even though they were not as efficient as compression ignition engines. They had the advantage of comparative simplicity, since they did not require the air compressor used by early Diesel engines; fuel was injected mechanically (solid injection) near the start of the compression stroke, at a much lower pressure than that of Diesel engines.&lt;ref name=mcneil/&gt;

===Oil-engined locomotive===
Richard Hornsby and Sons built the world's first oil-engined [[railway locomotive]] [[Moirai|LACHESIS]] for the [[Royal Arsenal]], [[Woolwich]], England, in 1896. They also built the first compression-ignition powered automobile.

===Oil engines outside the UK===
;Sweden
Similar engines were built by Bolinder in [[Sweden]] and some of these still survive in [[narrowboat|canal boat]]s.

;United States
Hot bulb engines were built in the USA by the [http://baldwindiesels.railfan.net/magazine-1936/page20.html De La Vergne Company] of [[New York City]], later the New York Refrigerating Company - inventing the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|modern refrigerator]] in 1930, who purchased a licence in 1893.

===Patent dispute with Rudolf Diesel===

[[Image:Herbert akroyd stuart plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque in Denmark Street, [[Bletchley]], UK, commemorating the work of Herbert Akroyd Stuart]]
The modern [[Diesel engine]] is a hybrid incorporating the features of direct (airless) injection and compression-ignition, both patented (No. 7146) as ''Improvements in Engines Operated by the Explosion of Mixtures of Combustible Vapour or Gas and Air'' by Akroyd-Stuart and Charles Richard Binney in May 1890.&lt;ref name="aoi"/&gt; Another patent (No. 15,994) was taken out on 8 October 1890, which details the working of a complete engine where air and fuel are introduced separately. But such a system was not feasible for the essential vaporization of heavier fuels for combustion in an enigne and moreover the modern diesel engine operation is based on vaporization by the fuel delivery system and not by internal thermal vaporization as in hot bulb which bears more similarity to original solution of Rudolph Diesel by employing injection and vaporization through air blast system which was the only technology available at that time capable of vaporizing and introducing heavier fuel at high pressure in the cylinder.

In 1890, Akroyd-Stuart patented the hot-bulb engine which had only about a 12% [[thermal efficiency]]. The reason for this, which he was not able to identify, was due to the lower pressures used (around 90 [[Pound-force per square inch|PSI]]&lt;ref name=wrangham/&gt;) as opposed to the Diesel engine's c. 500 PSI).

[[Rudolf Diesel]] patented the compression-ignition engine in 1892; however his injection system, where combustion was produced [[Isobaric process|isobarically]] (the technique having been patented by [[George Brayton]] in 1874 for his [[carburettor]]), was not subsumed into later engines, Akroyd-Stuart's injection system with [[Isochoric process|isochoric]] combustion developed at Hornsbys being preferred. However the airblast method was the only capable technique for introducing and vaporizing heavier fuel in the cylinder until diesel injection systems were developed by Bosch, and although similar in mechanism to modern diesel injection system the fuel delivery system in hot oil engines did not vaporize oil so in essence Rudolph Diesel's solution is the forerunner of modern diesel engines where fuel is vaporized as well as pressurized by the fuel delivery system and not by thermal vaporization in an internal hot chamber.

In 1892, Akroyd-Stuart patented a water-jacketed vaporiser to allow compression ratios to be increased. In the same year, [[Thomas Henry Barton]] (who later founded [[Barton Transport]]) at Hornsbys built a working high-compression version for experimental purposes, whereby the vaporiser was replaced with a [[cylinder head]], therefore not relying on air being preheated, but by combustion through higher [[compression ratio]]s. It ran for six hours - the first time automatic ignition was produced by compression alone. However such an engine would have required fuel to be injected at the end of compression stroke while the original hot bulb engine design had fuel introduced at the intake stroke although separately from air. So the success of such an engine with respect to performance and efficiency is not known and such a success would have overshadowed Rudolph Diesel's efforts and thus seems doubtful. Moreover since the fuel system of hot bulb engine did not vaporize the fuel so it is not viable to remove the hot bulb since heavier fuel do not burn at high pressures without sufficient vapours. {{citation needed|date=December 2008}}

On the other hand, Diesel understood [[thermodynamics]] and the theoretical and practical constraints on fuel efficiency. He knew that as much as 90% of the energy available in the fuel is wasted in a steam engine, and began to focus on designs that will achieve higher efficiency ratios. From 1893 to 1897, Rudolf Diesel continued to develop and improve his designs. He first experimented with a Carnot Cycle engine, and then developed his own approach. In his engine, fuel was injected at the end of compression and the fuel was ignited by the high temperature resulting from compression. This led to his design of the well-known high-compression prototype which was patented in 1897 in Germany and other countries, including the U.S. ({{US patent|542846}} and {{US patent|608845}}).

==Death==
In 1900, he moved to Australia and set up a company Sanders &amp; Stuart with his brother Charles, late in life moving back to [[Yorkshire]], [[England]]. He died on 19 February 1927&lt;ref name="BICL"&gt;{{cite book |title=The British Internal Combustion Locomotive 1894-1940 |author=Webb, Brian |publisher=David &amp; Charles |year=1973 |isbn=0715361155}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] and was buried in [[All Souls Church, Halifax|All Souls church]] in [[Akroydon|Boothtown]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]].

The [[University of Nottingham]] has hosted the Akroyd-Stuart Memorial Lecture on occasional years in his memory since 1928. One was presented by [[Frank Whittle|Sir Frank Whittle]] in 1946. Akroyd Stuart had worked with Professor William Robinson in the late 19th century, who was professor of engineering from 1890 to 1924 at University College Nottingham.

Akroyd-Stuart also left money to the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] and [[Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology|Institute of Marine Engineering]], which provided for their respective bi-annual Akroyd-Stuart Prizes.

{{farming}}
{{Main|Intensive farming}}
'''Intensive crop farming''' is a modern form of [[intensive farming]] that refers to the [[Industry|industrialized]] production of [[crop]]s. Intensive crop farming's methods include innovation in [[Mechanised agriculture|agricultural machinery]], farming methods, [[genetic engineering]] technology, techniques for achieving economies of scale in production, the creation of new markets for consumption, [[patent]] protection of genetic information, and [[Globalization|global trade]]. These methods are widespread in [[developed nation]]s.

The practice of industrial agriculture is a relatively recent development in the [[history of agriculture]], and the result of scientific discoveries and technological advances. Innovations in agriculture beginning in the late 19th century generally parallel developments in [[mass production]] in other industries that characterized the latter part of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The identification of [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] as critical factors in plant growth led to the manufacture of synthetic [[fertilizer]]s, making more intensive uses of farmland for crop production possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/org_farm/orgfarm_faq's.html|title=ORGANIC FARMING :: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the discovery of [[vitamin]]s and their role in animal [[nutrition]], in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which in the 1920s allowed certain livestock to be raised indoors, reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} The discovery of [[antibiotic]]s and [[vaccine]]s facilitated raising livestock in larger numbers by reducing disease. Chemicals developed for use in [[World War II]] gave rise to synthetic [[pesticide]]s. Developments in shipping networks and technology have made long-distance distribution of produce feasible.

== Crops ==
Certain crops have proven more amenable to intensive farming than others.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/how-to-live-with-it/crops.html|title=Crop Changes National Geographic|last=Robertson|first=Ricky|work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|accessdate=3 March 2016| location=”Madison”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features ===
* '''large scale'''&amp;nbsp;– hundreds or thousands of acres of a single crop (much more than can be absorbed into the local or regional market);
* '''[[monoculture]]'''&amp;nbsp;– large areas of a single crop, often raised from year to year on the same land, or with little [[crop rotation]];
* '''[[agrichemicals]]'''&amp;nbsp;– reliance on imported, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to provide nutrients and to mitigate pests and diseases, these applied on a regular schedule
* '''[[hybrid seed]]'''&amp;nbsp;– use of specialized hybrids designed to favor large scale distribution (e.g. ability to ripen off the vine, to withstand shipping and handling);
* '''[[genetically engineered crops]]'''&amp;nbsp;– use of genetically modified varieties designed for large scale production (e.g. ability to withstand selected herbicides);
* '''large scale [[irrigation]]'''&amp;nbsp;– heavy water use, and in some cases, growing of crops in otherwise unsuitable regions by extreme use of water (e.g. [[rice paddy|rice paddies]] on arid land).
* '''high [[mechanization]]'''&amp;nbsp;– automated machinery sustain and harvest crops.

=== Criticism ===

Critics of intensively farmed crops cite a wide range of concerns. On the food quality front, it is held by critics that quality is reduced when crops are bred and grown primarily for cosmetic and shipping characteristics. Environmentally, industrial farming of crops is claimed to be responsible for [[loss of biodiversity]], [[soil degradation|degradation]] of [[soil quality]], [[soil erosion]], food toxicity ([[pesticide]] residues) and pollution (through agrichemical build-ups and [[Surface runoff|runoff]], and use of [[fossil fuel]]s for agrichemical manufacture and for [[farm machinery]] and long-distance [[distribution (business)|distribution]]).

=== History ===
{{Main|Green Revolution}}
The projects within the [[Green Revolution]] spread technologies that had already existed, but had not been widely used outside of industrialized nations. These technologies included pesticides, [[irrigation]] projects, and synthetic nitrogen [[fertilizer]].

The novel technological development of the Green Revolution was the production of what some referred to as “miracle seeds.” &lt;ref name="brown"&gt;Brown, L R. 1970. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Seeds_of_change.html?id=e_tAAAAAIAAJ Seeds of Change: The Green Revolution and Development in the 1970s], London: Pall Mall Press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2013}} Scientists created strains of [[maize]], [[wheat]], and [[rice]] that are generally referred to as HYVs or “high-yielding varieties.”  HYVs have an increased nitrogen-absorbing potential compared to other varieties. Since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge, or fall over before harvest, semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes. [[Norin 10 wheat]], a variety developed by [[Orville Vogel]] from Japanese dwarf wheat varieties, was instrumental in developing Green Revolution wheat cultivars. IR8, the first widely implemented HYV rice to be developed by IRRI, was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named “Peta” and a Chinese variety named “Dee Geo Woo Gen.”&lt;ref name="ir8"&gt;Rice Varieties: IRRI Knowledge Bank. Accessed August 2006. {{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713032524/http://www.knowledgebank.irri.org/regionalSites/nepal/RiceVarieties.htm |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }} &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With the availability of molecular genetics in Arabidopsis and rice the mutant genes responsible (''reduced height(rht)'', ''gibberellin insensitive (gai1)'' and ''slender rice (slr1)'') have been cloned and identified as cellular signalling components of gibberellic acid, a phytohormone involved in regulating stem growth via its effect on cell division. Stem growth in the mutant background is significantly reduced leading to the dwarf phenotype. Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically. Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilisers on commercial yield.

HYVs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers. In the absence of these inputs, traditional varieties may outperform HYVs. One criticism of HYVs is that they were developed as [[F1 hybrids]], meaning they need to be purchased by a farmer every season rather than [[seed saving|saved]] from previous seasons, thus increasing a farmer’s cost of production.

=== Examples ===

==== Wheat (modern management techniques) ====
{{Main|Wheat}}
[[Wheat]] is a [[Poaceae|grass]] that is cultivated worldwide. Globally, it is the most important human food grain and ranks second in total production as a [[cereal|cereal crop]] behind [[maize]]; the third being [[rice]]. Wheat and [[barley]] were the first cereals known to have been domesticated. Cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses led to the [[domestication]] of wheat through selection of mutant forms with tough years which remained intact during harvesting, and larger grains. Because of the loss of seed dispersal mechanisms, domesticated wheats have limited capacity to propagate in the wild.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, C. Wayne. (1995) ''Crop Production''. John Wiley and Sons. pp. 60&amp;nbsp;62. {{ISBN|0-471-07972-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural cultivation using [[horse collar]] leveraged plows (3000 years ago) increased cereal grain productivity yields, as did the use of [[seed drill]]s which replaced broadcasting sowing of seed in the 18th century. Yields of wheat continued to increase, as new land came under cultivation and with improved agricultural husbandry involving the use of [[fertilizer]]s, threshing machines and reaping machines (the '[[combine harvester]]'), [[tractor]]-draw cultivators and planters, and better varieties (see [[Green Revolution]] and [[Norin 10 wheat]]). With population growth rates falling, while yields continue to rise, the area devoted to wheat may now begin to decline for the first time in modern [[human history]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff, The Economist, Dec 20th 2005 [http://www.economist.com/node/5323362 The story of wheat. Ears of plenty: The story of man's staple food]&lt;/ref&gt;

While winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze, wheat normally requires between 110 and 130 days between planting and harvest, depending upon climate, seed type, and soil conditions. Crop management decisions require the knowledge of stage of development of the crop. In particular, spring [[fertilizer]]s applications, [[herbicide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, [[Plant hormone|growth regulators]] are typically applied at specific stages of plant development. For example, current recommendations often indicate the second application of nitrogen be done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm in size (Z31 on [[Zadoks scale]]).

==== Maize (mechanical harvesting) ====
{{Main|Maize}}
Maize was planted by the [[Native American (Americas)|Native Americans]] in hills, in a complex system known to some as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]: [[bean]]s used the corn plant for support, and [[Squash (fruit)|squashes]] provided ground cover to stop weeds. This method was replaced by single species hill planting where each hill {{convert|60|–|120|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} apart was planted with 3 or 4 seeds, a method still used by home gardeners. A later technique was ''checked corn'' where hills were placed {{convert|40|in|mm}} apart in each direction, allowing cultivators to run through the field in two directions. In more arid lands this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of {{convert|10|–|12|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep furrows to collect water. Modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young, although the hill technique is still used in the cornfields of some Native American reservations.  Haudenosaunee Confederacy is what a group of Native Americans who are preparing for climate change through seed banking.  Now this group is known as the Iroquois.&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;

&lt;ref name="Robertson" /&gt;
With a climate changing more crops are able to grow in different areas that they previously weren't able to grow in.  This will open growing areas for maize.

[[File:Cornheap.jpg|200px|thumb|right| A corn heap at the harvest site, [[India]]]]
In North America, fields are often planted in a two-[[crop rotation]] with a [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] crop, often [[alfalfa]] in cooler climates and [[soybean]]s in regions with longer summers. Sometimes a third crop, [[winter wheat]], is added to the rotation. Fields are usually plowed each year, although [[no-till farming]] is increasing in use. Many of the maize varieties grown in the United States and Canada are hybrids. Over half of the corn area planted in the United States has been [[genetically modified]] using [[biotechnology]] to express agronomic traits such as pest resistance or herbicide resistance.

Before about [[World War II]], most maize in North America was harvested by hand (as it still is in most of the other countries where it is grown). This often involved large numbers of workers and associated social events. Some one- and two-row mechanical pickers were in use but the corn [[combine harvester|combine]] was not adopted until after the War. By hand or mechanical picker, the entire ear is harvested which then requires a separate operation of a corn sheller to remove the kernels from the ear. Whole ears of corn were often stored in ''corn cribs'' and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use. Few modern farms store maize in this manner. Most harvest the grain from the field and store it in bins. The combine with a corn head (with points and snap rolls instead of a reel) does not cut the stalk; it simply pulls the stalk down. The stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground. The ear of corn is too large to pass through a slit in a plate and the snap rolls pull the ear of corn from the stalk so that only the ear and husk enter the machinery. The combine separates the husk and the cob, keeping only the kernels.

==== Soybean (genetic modification) ====
{{Main|Soybean}}
Soybeans are one of the "[[Biotechnology|biotech]] food" crops that are being [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified]], and GMO soybeans are being used in an increasing number of products. [[Monsanto Company]] is the world's leader in genetically modified soy for the commercial market. In 1995, Monsanto introduced "[[Roundup Ready]]" (RR) soybeans that have had a copy of a [[gene]] from the bacterium, ''Agrobacterium'' sp. strain CP4, inserted, by means of a [[gene gun]], into its genome that allows the [[transgenic]] plant to survive being sprayed by this non-selective herbicide, [[glyphosate]]. Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, kills conventional soybeans. The bacterial gene is EPSP (= 5-enolpyruvyl shikimic acid-3-phosphate) synthase. Soybean also has a version of this gene, but the soybean version is sensitive to glyphosate, while the CP4 version is not.&lt;ref&gt;Padgette SR, Kolacz KH, Delannay X, Re DB, LaVallee BJ, Tinius CN, Rhodes WK, Otero YI, Barry GF, Eichholz DA, Peschke VM, Nida DL, Taylor NB, Kishore GM (1995) Development, identification, and characterization of a glyphosate-tolerant soybean line. Crop Sci 35:1451-1461&lt;/ref&gt;

RR soybeans allow a farmer to reduce tillage or even to sow the seed directly into an unplowed field, known as 'no-till' or conservation tillage. No-till agriculture has many advantages, greatly reducing soil erosion and creating better wildlife habitat;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationinformation.org/|title=CTIC HOME|website=www.conservationinformation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also saves fossil fuels, and sequesters CO2, a greenhouse effect gas.&lt;ref&gt;Brookes G and Barfoot P (2005) GM crops: The global economic and environmental impact—the first nine years 1996–2004. AgBioForum 8:187&amp;nbsp;195&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''1997'', about 8% of all soybeans cultivated for the commercial market in the United States were genetically modified. In 2006, the figure was 89%. As with other "[[Roundup Ready crops]]", concern is expressed over damage to [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Liu |first= KeShun |title= Soybeans: Chemistry, Technology, and Utilization |url= |type= Hardcover |accessdate= |edition= |date=1997-05-01 |publisher= Springer |location= |language= |isbn= 0-8342-1299-4 |doi = |pages= 532 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the RR gene has been bred into so many different soybean cultivars that the genetic modification itself has not resulted in any decline of genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sneller |first=CH |year=2003 |title=Impact of transgenic genotypes and subdivision on diversity within elite North American soybean germplasm |journal=Crop Sciences |issue=43 |pp=409-414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tomato (hydroponics) ====
{{Main|Hydroponics}}

The largest commercial [[hydroponics]] facility in the world is Eurofresh Farms in Willcox, Arizona, which sold more than 200 million pounds of [[tomato]]es in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adelman |first=Jacob |date=November 21, 2008 |title=Urban growers go high-tech to feed city dwellers |publisher=Newsvine |url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2008/11/21/2134661-urban-growers-go-high-tech-to-feed-city-dwellers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurofresh has {{convert|318|acre|km2|1}} under glass and represents about a third of the commercial hydroponic greenhouse area in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eurofresh Farms |year=2007 |title=Eurofresh Farms Adds 53-acre Greenhouse |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710204625/http://www.eurofresh.com/pdfs/GreenhouseCapacityGrows.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eurofresh does not consider their tomatoes organic, but they are pesticide-free. They are grown in rockwool with top irrigation.

Some commercial installations use no [[pesticide]]s or [[herbicide]]s, preferring [[integrated pest management]] techniques. There is often a price premium willingly paid by consumers for produce which is labeled "[[organic food|organic]]". Some states in the USA require soil as an essential to obtain [[organic certification]]. There are also overlapping and somewhat contradictory rules established by the US Federal Government. So some food grown with hydroponics can be certified [[organic farming|organic]]. In fact, they are the cleanest plants possible because there is no environment variable and the dirt in the food supply is extremely limited. Hydroponics also saves an incredible amount of water; It uses as little as 1/20 the amount as a regular farm to produce the same amount of food. The [[water table]] can be impacted by the water use and [[Surface runoff|run-off]] of chemicals from farms, but hydroponics may minimize impact as well as having the advantage that water use and water returns are easier to measure. This can save the farmer money by allowing reduced water use and the ability to measure consequences to the land around a farm.

The environment in a hydroponics [[greenhouse]] is tightly controlled for maximum efficiency and this new mindset is called soil-less/[[controlled-environment agriculture]] (S/CEA). With this growers can make ultra-premium foods anywhere in the world, regardless of temperature and growing seasons. Growers monitor the temperature, humidity, and [[pH]] level constantly.

'''Laneros''' (often stylized as '''LANeros''') is a digital [[community]] of over 370,000 members worldwide, mostly of Hispanic countries, started in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laneros.com/foros|title=Forum Statistics|date=2 May 2014|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its slogan is "Digital Addiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primernombre.com/beneficios-web/recomendados/220-bw0017|title=La comunidad mas grande de Colombia|accessdate=2 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506181749/http://primernombre.com/beneficios-web/recomendados/220-bw0017|archivedate=6 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) film''' is a nanostructured system formed when Langmuir films - or Langmuir monolayers (LM)- are transferred from the liquid-gas interface to solid supports during the vertical passage of the support through the monolayers. LB films can contain one or more [[monolayers]] of an organic material, deposited from the surface of a liquid onto a solid by immersing (or emersing) the solid substrate into (or from) the liquid. A monolayer is adsorbed homogeneously with each immersion or emersion step, thus films with very accurate thickness can be formed. This thickness is accurate because the thickness of each monolayer is known and can therefore be added to find the total thickness of a Langmuir–Blodgett film.

The monolayers are assembled vertically and are usually composed either of [[amphiphilic]] molecules (see [[Chemical polarity]]) with a [[hydrophilic]] head and a hydrophobic tail (example: [[fatty acids]]) or nowadays commonly of [[nanoparticle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biolinscientific.com/zafepress.php?url=%2Fpdf%2FKSV%20NIMA%2FApplication%20Overviews%2Ffabricating-highly-organized-nanoparticle-thin-films.pdf|title=Fabricating Highly Organized Nanoparticle Thin Films|last=|first=|date=|website=Biolin Scientific|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Langmuir–Blodgett films are named after [[Irving Langmuir]] and [[Katharine B. Blodgett]], who invented this technique while working in Research and Development for [[General Electric Co.]] 

==Historical background==
Advances to the discovery of LB and LM films began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1773 when he dropped about a teaspoon of oil onto a pond. Franklin noticed that the waves were calmed almost instantly and that the calming of the waves spread for about half an [[acre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author-last=Franklin|author-first=Benjamin|author-link=Benjamin Franklin|title=From Benjamin Franklin to William Brownrigg|date=7 November 1773|quote=At length being at Clapham, where there is, on the Common, a large Pond, which I observed to be one Day very rough with the Wind, I fetched out a Cruet of Oil, and dropt a little of it on the Water.6 I saw it spread itself with surprising swiftness upon the surface, but the effect of smoothing the waves was not produced; for I had applied it first on the Leeward Side of the Pond where the Waves were largest, and the Wind drove my Oil back upon the Shore. I then went to the Windward Side, where they began to form; and there the Oil tho’ not more than a Tea Spoonful produced an instant Calm, over a Space several yards square, which spread amazingly, and extended itself gradually till it reached the Lee Side, making all that Quarter of the Pond, perhaps half an Acre, as smooth as a Looking Glass.|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-20-02-0250}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Franklin did not realize was that the oil had formed a monolayer on top of the pond surface. Over a century later, [[Lord Rayleigh]] quantified what [[Benjamin Franklin]] had seen. Knowing that the oil, [[oleic acid]], had spread evenly over the water, Rayleigh calculated that the thickness of the film was 1.6&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometer|nm]] by knowing the volume of oil dropped and the area of coverage.

With the help of her kitchen sink, [[Agnes Pockels]] showed that area of films can be controlled with barriers. She added that surface tension varies with contamination of water. She used different oils to deduce that surface pressure would not change until area was confined to about 0.2&amp;nbsp;nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This work was originally written as a letter to [[Lord Rayleigh]] who then helped Agnes Pockels become published in the journal, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', in 1891.[[File:Sarfus.stearic acid one monolayer.jpg|thumb|[[Sarfus]] image of one Langmuir monolayer of stearic acid (thickness=2.4nm).|354x354px]]Agnes Pockels’ work set the stage for [[Irving Langmuir]] who continued to work and confirmed Pockels’ results. Using Pockels’ idea, he developed the Langmuir (or [[Langmuir–Blodgett trough|Langmuir–Blodgett]]) trough. His observations indicated that chain length did not impact the affected area since the organic molecules were arranged vertically.

Langmuir’s breakthrough did not occur until he hired [[Katherine Blodgett]] as his assistant. Blodgett initially went to seek for a job at [[General Electric]] ([[GE]]) with Langmuir during her [[Christmas]] break of her senior year at [[Bryn Mawr College]], where she received a BA in [[Physics]].  Langmuir advised to Blodgett that she should continue her education before working for him. She thereafter attended [[University of Chicago]] for her MA in [[Chemistry]]. Upon her completion of her Master's, Langmuir hired her as his assistant. However, breakthroughs in surface chemistry happened after she received her [[PhD degree]] in 1926 from [[Cambridge University]].

While working for GE, Langmuir and Blodgett discovered that when a solid surface is inserted into an aqueous solution containing  organic moieties, the organic molecules will deposit a [[monolayer]] homogeneously over the surface. This is the Langmuir–Blodgett film deposition process. Through this work in [[surface chemistry]] and with the help of Blodgett, Langmuir was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1932. In addition, Blodgett used Langmuir–Blodgett film  to create 99% transparent anti-reflective glass by coating glass with fluorinated organic compounds, forming a simple [[anti-reflective coating]].

==Physical insight==
Langmuir films are formed when amphiphilic (surfactants) molecules or nanoparticles are spread on the air at an air–water interface. [[Surfactants]] (or surface-acting agents) are molecules with hydrophobic 'tails' and hydrophilic 'heads'. When [[surfactant]] concentration is less than the minimum surface concentration of collapse and it is completely insoluble in water , the surfactant molecules arrange themselves as shown in Figure 1 below. This tendency can be explained by surface-energy considerations. Since the tails are hydrophobic, their exposure to air is favoured over that to water. Similarly, since the heads are hydrophilic, the head–water interaction is more favourable than air–water interaction. The overall effect is reduction in the surface energy (or equivalently, surface tension of water).

&lt;center&gt;[[File:Surfactant.jpg]]&lt;br&gt; Figure 1: Surfactant molecules arranged on an air–water interface&lt;/center&gt;

For very small concentrations, far from the surface density compatible with the collapse of the monolayer (which leads to polylayers structures) the  [[surfactant]] molecules execute a random motion on the water–air interface. This motion can be thought to be similar to the motion of [[ideal gas|ideal-gas]] molecules enclosed in a container. The corresponding thermodynamic variables for the surfactant system are, [[surface pressure]] (&lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;), [[surface area]] (A) and number of [[surfactant]] molecules (N). This system behaves similar to a gas in a container. The density of surfactant molecules as well as the surface pressure increases upon reducing the surface area A ('compression' of the 'gas').  Further compression of the surfactant molecules on the surface shows behavior similar to phase transitions. The ‘gas’ gets compressed into ‘liquid’ and ultimately into a perfectly closed packed array of the surfactant molecules on the surface corresponding to a ‘solid’ state. The liquid state is usually separated in the liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed states. All the Langmuir film states are classified according to the compressionality factor of the films, defined as -A(d (&lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt;)/dA), usually related to the in-plane elasticity of the monolayer. 

The condensed Langmuir films (in surface pressures usually higher than 15 mN/m - typically 30 mN/m) can be subsequently transferred onto a solid substrate to create highly organized thin film coatings. [[Langmuir–Blodgett trough|Langmuir–Blodgett troughs]]  

Besides LB film from surfactants depicted in Figure 1, similar monolayers can also be made from inorganic nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kotov|first=N. A.|last2=Meldrum|first2=F. C.|last3=Wu|first3=C.|last4=Fendler|first4=J. H.|date=1994-03-01|title=Monoparticulate Layer and Langmuir-Blodgett-Type Multiparticulate Layers of Size-Quantized Cadmium Sulfide Clusters: A Colloid-Chemical Approach to Superlattice Construction|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/j100062a006|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=98|issue=11|pages=2735–2738|doi=10.1021/j100062a006|issn=0022-3654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pressure–area characteristics==
Adding a [[monolayer]] to the surface reduces the [[surface tension]], and the surface pressure, &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is given by the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi = \gamma_0 - \gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the surface tension of the [[water]] and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension due to the monolayer. But the concentration-dependence of surface tension (similar to [[Langmuir isotherm]]) is as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0 - \gamma = RTK_H C = - RT\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi = RT\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;\Pi A = RT.&lt;/math&gt;

The last equation indicates a relationship similar to [[ideal gas law]]. However, it should be noted that the concentration-dependence of surface tension is valid only when the solutions are dilute and concentrations are low. Hence, at very low concentrations of the surfactant, the molecules behave like [[ideal gas]] molecules.

Experimentally, the surface pressure is usually measured using the [[Wilhelmy plate]]. A pressure sensor/electrobalance arrangement detects the pressure exerted by the monolayer. Also monitored is the area to the side of the barrier which the monolayer resides.

&lt;center&gt;[[File:WilhelmyPlate.jpg]]&lt;br /&gt;Figure 2. A Wilhelmy plate&lt;/center&gt;

A simple force balance on the plate leads to the following equation for the surface pressure:

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi = -\Delta \gamma = - \left[ \frac{\Delta F}{2(t_p + w_p)} \right] \approx - \frac{\Delta F}{2w_p},&lt;/math&gt;

only when &lt;math&gt;w_p \gg t_p&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\ell_p, w_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t_p&lt;/math&gt; are the dimensions of the plate, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta F&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in forces. The [[Wilhelmy plate]] measurements give pressure – area isotherms that show phase transition-like behaviour of the LM films, as mentioned before (see figure below). In the gaseous phase, there is minimal pressure increase for a decrease in area. This continues until the first transition occurs and there is a proportional increase in pressure with decreasing area. Moving into the solid region is accompanied by another sharp transition to a more severe area dependent pressure. This trend continues up to a point where the molecules are relatively close packed and have very little room to move. Applying an increasing pressure at this point causes the [[monolayer]] to become unstable and destroy the monolayer forming polylayer structures towards the air phase. The surface pressure during the monolayer collapse may remain approximately constant (in a process near the equilibrium) or may decay abruptly (out of equilibrium - when the surface pressure was over-increased because lateral compression was too fast for monomolecular rearrangements).

==Applications==

Many possible applications have been suggested over years for LM and LB films. Their characteristics are extremely thin films and high degree of structural order. These films have different optical, electrical and biological properties which are composed of some specific organic compounds. [[Organic compounds]] usually have more positive responses than [[inorganic]] materials for outside factors ([[pressure]], [[temperature]] or gas change). LM films can be used also as models for half a cellular membrane.

*  LB films consisting of nanoparticles can be used for example to create functional coatings, sophisticated sensor surfaces and to coat silicon wafers. 
*  LB films can be used as passive layers in [[Metal Insulator Semiconductor|MIS]] (metal-insulator-semiconductor) which have more open structure than [[silicon oxide]], and they allow gases to penetrate to the interface more effectively.
*  LB films also can be used as [[biological membranes]]. [[Lipid]] molecules with the fatty acid moiety of long carbon chains attached to a polar group have received extended attention because of being naturally suited to the Langmuir method of film production.  This type of biological membrane can be used to investigate: the modes of [[drug action]], the permeability of biologically active molecules, and the chain reactions of biological systems.
*  Also, it is possible to propose field effect devices for observing the [[immunological response]] and enzyme-substrate reactions by collecting biological molecules such as antibodies and enzymes in insulating LB films.
*  Anti-reflective glass can be produced with successive layers of fluorinated organic film.
*  The [[glucose]] [[biosensor]] can be made of poly(3-hexyl thiopene) as Langmuir–Blodgett film, which entraps glucose-oxide and transfers it to a coated [[indium]]-[[tin]]-[[oxide]] glass plate.
*  UV resists can be made of poly(N-alkylmethacrylamides) Langmuir–Blodgett film.
*  [[UV light]] and [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of a Langmuir–Blodgett film.
*  Langmuir–Blodgett films are inherently 2D-structures and can be built up layer by layer, by dipping hydrophobic or hydrophilic substrates into a liquid sub-phase.
* '''Langmuir–Blodgett patterning''' is a new paradigm for large-area patterning with mesostructured features&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ar600019r|title=Langmuir–Blodgett Patterning: A Bottom–Up Way to Build Mesostructures over Large Areas|date=2007|last1=Chen|first1=Xiaodong|last2=Lenhert|first2=Steven|last3=Hirtz|first3=Michael|last4=Lu|first4=Nan|last5=Fuchs|first5=Harald|last6=Chi|first6=Lifeng|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=40|issue=6|pages=393–401|pmid=17441679}}

Several varieties exist, depending on their purpose:

* Various backlit viewing devices:  
** A container with several [[lightbulb]]s and a pane of [[frosted glass]] on the top. It is used by photography professionals viewing [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] films, such as [[Photographic slide|slide]]s. This device was originally used to sort [[photographic plate]]s with ease. When laid flat, it may be called a [[light table]]. Generally, a lightbox uses light similar to daylight (5,000–6,000 [[kelvin]]s (K)) and has uniform light strength on the glass pane.
**In the form of vertical panels, they can also be found mounted on the walls of hospitals and medical offices to review [[X-ray]] images. 
** In the science field, lightboxes are often used for looking at bacterial growth and allow better visualization for [[PCR]] plates.
** A lighted display panel used for advertising purposes. The panel can be illuminated by fluorescent light bulbs or LED lighting strips. The efficiency of light boxes improved dramatically after the introduction of LED technology. The user inserts a graphic, which can be changed easily. Some light boxes are designed especially for outdoor purposes so they are more weatherproof.
* The fabric reflectors that attach to studio lighting via a connector to create soft lighting by diffusing the strobe flash are called "light boxes".  They generally come in various rectangle or octagon shapes.  Interior reflectors can be white, silver or gold to alter the temperature of light.  Baffling inserts are also available.
* A variation of this is a box, with one open end, made of diffusing material, to allow the photographing of a sample object with no shadows. It is also called '''light tent''' or '''photo cube'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/3-great-ways-to-utilize-a-light-cube--photo-16886 3 Great Ways to Utilize a Light Cube], photography.tutsplus.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* A folder used on [[stock photography]] to allow a user to organize digital photos. Photos can be assigned to a viewable lightbox folder by subject, for later convenience, or used to compile unrelated photos for a specific project layout. Lightboxes also allow graphic designers to show clients options for a project in one simple uncluttered folder.&lt;ref name="PorebskiPrzystalski2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bartosz Porebski|author2=Karol Przystalski|author3=Leszek Nowak|title=Building PHP Applications with Symfony, CakePHP, and Zend Framework|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gTEl2mWGNtAC&amp;pg=PA259|date=17 February 2011|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-1-118-06792-5|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17873">This is an incomplete list of gasoline engines designed by '''[[Maybach]]''' AG, used in various German tracked military vehicles (mostly [[tank]]s and [[half-track]]s) before and during World War II.

==Nomenclature==
1. Performance
* NL = ''Normalleistung'' (normal performance motor)
* HL = ''Hochleistung'' (high performance motor)
This is followed by the approx. engine capacity (e.g. HL42 = approx. 4.2 litres)

2. Installation
* P = Panzerkampfwageneinbau (tank installation)
* Z = Zerstorereinbau (tank destroyer installation)
e.g. HL45 Z, HL230 P30. These letters were only used on some models.

3. Lubrication 
* TR = ''Trockensumpfschmierung'' (dry sump), generally fitted to tanks - due to low ground clearance, and some halftracks. There is no sump below the crankcase: the engine oil is contained in a tank on one side, sometimes with an external driveshaft passing through it in a tunnel. 
* TU = ''Tiefer Unterteil'' ('deep lower part' i.e. wet sump), only fitted to some halftracks. The sump has an inverted triangle shape, bolted to the underneath of the crankcase housing. 

4. Transmission
[[File:Pz_III_Motor-Getriebe.svg|thumb|right|[[Panzer III]] engine and Maybach-Variorex pre-selector gearbox (in German). Click picture for English translation.]]
* K = ''Kupplung'' or ''Kupplungsgehäuse'' (clutch): a clutch and manual gearbox is attached directly to the flywheel end of the crankshaft. This type of transmission was fitted to all halftracks, both TR and TU types, and to early [[Panzer I]]s.
* If there is no clutch (K), a horizontal splined shaft connects the flywheel to a separate pneumatically-controlled pre-selector gearbox. Located next to the driver, it is operated by vacuum pressure generated by a compressor (R) - ''see'' next section. Various gearboxes were used, including the Maybach-Variorex 10-speed gearbox on the [[Panzer III]] (see diagram on right): this proved to be mechanically vulnerable.{{cn|date=May 2018}}Other units included the [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] SSG 5x and 7x Aphon series pre-selector gearboxes (the SSG 75 had five forward gears and one reverse: the 76 and 77 had six and seven forward gears respectively). Bigger tank engines used a Maybach Olvar transmission.

5. Compressor
* R = ''Riemenantrieb für Luftpresser'' (belt drive for air compressor), driven by a pulley at the other end from the flywheel: this provided the pressure for a pneumatically-operated gearbox, eg the Maybach-Variorex, or the Olvar. On inline-6 models, the belt-driven compressor is mounted on the inlet side at the end away from the flywheel: on V-12 models, the compressor is located between the two banks of cylinders at the other end from the flywheel (see diagram above: part of the compressor pulley can be seen on the extreme top r. in the photo of the HL120 in [[#Gallery|§ Gallery]] below).
:To shift gears with the Variorex, the pre-selector lever is set in the desired position or slot, and then the clutch pedal is depressed. The air inlet of the compressor is connected to the system, not the outlet: the compressor works "in reverse" to create a vacuum. Inside the Variorex gearbox there are vacuum-actuated pistons: these move dog clutches, which select the desired gearing.&lt;ref&gt; Photos, diagrams (some in English) and explanations here: {{cite web| url=https://kedoki.livejournal.com/100805.html |title=О крайней упоротости Pz.III ausf.E-G.

E-G) |website=Kedoki |language=Russian |accessdate=21 April 2018}} (Russian website, but machine translation is not too bad these days).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Models fitted with a clutch (K) could also have a compressor fitted, which may have been used to power a secondary gearbox.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

6. Ignition
* M = ''Schnapper-Magnetzündung'' (impulse magneto): some models had a [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] 12-volt [[magneto]] for the ignition. On both 6- and 12-cylinder engines, the magneto (with distributor) is geared to the starter ring on the flywheel. Most models were also fitted with a belt-driven alternator for charging the batteries for the starter motor, lighting, etc. &lt;ref name=flickr_HL42 &gt;Photo (with Solex carburetter above, and fuel pump below l.) at {{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/pilot_michael/15789565002 |title=Maybach Sechszylindermotor HL 42|website=flickr|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- On 12-cylinder engines the magneto was located between the cylinder heads, driven by the gears which also drive the camshafts{{citation needed |date=May 2018}} --&gt;
* The alternative to a magneto was an [[ignition coil]] connected to a vertically-mounted [[distributor]] driven from one end of the camshaft.&lt;ref&gt;Photo at {{cite web |title=Maybach NL-38 |url=http://www.fahrzeuge-der-wehrmacht.de/Bilder/Maybach_NL-38_Ko_01-1.jpg |website=Fahrzeuge der Wehrmacht |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* NL38 TRKM = Normal performance 3.8 litre, dry sump, clutch, magneto

German WWII halftrack numbering may appear not to be strictly logical: in order of engine size and therefore towing capacity, they were numbered Sd.Kfz. 10, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9. The two smallest vehicles were introduced after most of the larger prime movers were in production.{{sfn|Milsom|1975|pp=7-8}}

==Design==
A number of Maybach motors shared the same basic design but had different engine sizes, the larger engines having bigger cylinders to increase the capacity. Similar engine designs had shared parts lists, e.g. the NL38 and HL42; the HL57 and HL62; and the HL108 and HL120.&lt;ref&gt;Photos of various front covers at {{cite web |title=Maybach HL 62 TUK 6-cylinder Vergasermotor Owner's Manual Brochure |url=https://www.classicseller.com/en/various/engine-gear/maybach-hl-62-tuk-6-cylinder-vergasermotor-owner-s-manual-brochure-101278 |website=classicseller.com |accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6-cylinder Maybach engines used a single [[Solex]] 40 JFF II down-draught [[carburetor]],&lt;ref name=flickr_HL42 /&gt; and earlier V-12s used two. Later V-12s used Solex 52 JFFs.&lt;ref&gt;Photos of Solex 40 carbs (end of page) at {{cite web |url=http://www.rommelkiste.de/panzer4/bilder.html |title=Panzer IV Ausf.G (früh) |website=Rommelkiste.de |language=German |accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret M. Faul''' is an Irish / American chemist and executive who has won multiple awards for innovations in process chemistry.

== Background ==
Faul received her undergraduate degrees from [[University College Dublin|University College, Dublin]] before embarking on doctoral studies with Professor [[David A. Evans]] at Harvard. Her studies focused mostly on metal-catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=David A.|last2=Bilodeau|first2=Mark T.|last3=Faul|first3=Margaret M.|date=April 1994|title=Development of the Copper-Catalyzed Olefin Aziridination Reaction|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00086a007|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=116|issue=7|pages=2742–2753|doi=10.1021/ja00086a007|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce aziridines, strained nitrogen precursors valued as pharmaceutical intermediates. Faul introduced multiple new wrinkles into this chemistry, including using chiral copper(I) catalysts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=David A.|last2=Faul|first2=Margaret M.|last3=Bilodeau|first3=Mark T.|last4=Anderson|first4=Benjamin A.|last5=Barnes|first5=David M.|date=June 1993|title=Bis(oxazoline)-copper complexes as chiral catalysts for the enantioselective aziridination of olefins|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja00065a068|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=115|issue=12|pages=5328–5329|doi=10.1021/ja00065a068|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; to produce enantiomerically-enriched aziridines, and using a variety of different nitrene sources for the transfer.

== Research ==
Faul joined the [[process chemistry]] group at [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in 1993, and joined [[Amgen]]'s process group in 2003, rising eventually to its Executive Director. According to a biosketch at ''[[Organic Syntheses]]'', Faul has expertise in Good Manufacturing Process scale-up of both chemical and biological therapeutics, and coordinates groups of external partners through licensing, regulatory, and program development issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faul|first=Margaret|date=2017|title=Faul biosketch|url=http://www.orgsyn.org/content/pdfs/obits/margaretfaul.pdf|journal=Organic Syntheses|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attributes much of Amgen's success in this area to early adoption of new technologies, such as [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] carbon dioxide purification and ultra-[[High-performance liquid chromatography|high performance liquid chromatography]] (uPLC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patel|first=Prachi|date=2017-02-10|title=A Conversation with Margaret Faul|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00050|journal=ACS Central Science|language=EN|volume=3|issue=2|pages=141–142|doi=10.1021/acscentsci.7b00050|issn=2374-7943|pmc=5324089|pmid=28280781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SLR cross section.svg|thumb|right|With mirror lock-up the mirror (2) flips up towards (5) well before the shutter (3) opens. As a result light no longer reaches the eyepiece (8). ]]
'''Mirror lock-up''' (often abbreviated to '''MLU''') is a feature employed in many [[single-lens reflex camera|Single Lens Reflex (SLR) cameras]].  It allows the operator to reduce [[vibration]]-induced [[motion blur]] during [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]]. It also allows the mounting of lenses which extend into the SLR's mirror box when mounted.

== Reducing vibration ==
Normal operation in an SLR camera involves flipping the mirror up out of the light-path just before the [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] opens, and then returning it when the shutter closes (although very early SLR's required the shutter to be cocked for the mirror to return). This causes vibration of the camera, particularly when the mirror slaps into the top of the mirror box. This vibration quickly dies away so the most motion blur is actually seen with short shutter times that capture multiple 'swings' of the vibration (shutter speeds of 1/2 to 1/60 second are often affected by this). While longer exposures will capture all of the vibrations, the exposure will be dominated by light captured when the camera is vibration-free (assuming a steady mount).

Mirror lock-up involves flipping the mirror up well before the shutter opens, allowing the vibrations to die down before exposing the film. On some cameras MLU may be operated by an extra push of the shutter button, the second push resulting in the actual opening of the shutter. Other arrangements may involve an extra lever or button that flips the mirror up before using the shutter release button normally. On some cameras MLU is not a separate feature, but operated as part of the [[self timer]] (notably the [[Nikon FE]] line of cameras).

Note that when the mirror is in the up and locked position, the subject is no longer visible through the [[viewfinder]]. Therefore, the photographer must compose the photograph prior to activating mirror lock-up and keep the camera from moving. Use of a [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]] helps prevent movement of the camera during this operation.

Combined with a remote or cable release, this greatly reduces the potential for vibration of the camera.

== Lenses requiring mirror lock-up ==
Some lenses are designed such that they extend into the mirror box when properly mounted on an SLR. These may include early wide-angle lenses for SLR's, certain lenses designed for [[rangefinder camera]]s, and certain other non-SLR lenses adapted for SLR use. Mirror lock-up must be activated prior to mounting such lenses, and kept in place in order to prevent damage to the lens and/or camera. This method of operation prevents any use of the SLR viewfinder with the lens. Prior to the development of lenses utilizing the [[Angénieux retrofocus]] concept, mirror lock-up was essential to wide-angle SLR photography.

The '''OpenBSD Journal''' is an [[online newspaper]] dedicated to coverage of [[OpenBSD]] software and related events.

== History ==
The OpenBSD Journal was founded in 2000 and operated until 1 April 2004 at {{URL|deadly.org}}. On 1 April 2004 the editors James Phillips and Jose Nazario announced that the site ceased its operation.&lt;ref name="deadly-announce" /&gt; Daniel Hartmeier backed up the contents of the journal in order to preserve them.&lt;ref name="onlamp-reborn" /&gt; Further investigation to the articles' structure lead to creation of [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]-based engine that would enable access to the deadly.org's content on a backup server. Consequently, the functionality of adding new articles was implemented and the previous editors allowed to re-publish articles. The OpenBSD Journal was therefore reintroduced at {{URL|undeadly.org}} on 9 April 2004.&lt;ref name="undeadly-about" /&gt;

== The role in OpenBSD community ==
The OpenBSD Journal is widely recognized as a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] of OpenBSD-related information.&lt;ref name="onlamp-reborn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="the-book-of-pf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="absolute-openbsd" /&gt; It is a primary reporter for such events as [[Hackathon]]s. The site also hosts the OpenBSD developers' blogs.

== Editors ==
The current editors of OpenBSD Journal are:&lt;ref name="undeadly-about" /&gt;

A '''plug computer''' is an external device, often configured for use in the [[home server|home]] or office as a compact computer. It consists of a high-performance, low-power [[system-on-a-chip]] processor with several I/O ports (USB ports, ...) and typically runs any of a number of [[Linux]] distributions. Most versions do not have provisions for connecting a display and are best suited as for running [[media server]], back-up services, [[file sharing]] and [[remote desktop software|remote access]] functions, thus acting as a bridge between in-home protocols such as [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] (DLNA) and [[Server Message Block]] (SMB) and cloud based services. There are, however, plug computer offerings that have analog VGA monitor and/or [[HDMI]] connectors, which, along with multiple USB ports, permit the use of a display, keyboard, and mouse, thus making them full-fledged, low-power alternatives to desktop and notebook computers.

The name "plug computer" is derived from the small configuration of such devices: plug computers are often enclosed in an [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC power plug]] or [[AC adapter]].

Plug computers typically consume little power and are inexpensive.  One manufacturer claims its [[United States dollar|$]]119 plug computer draws 1.2 [[watt]]s and can cost $2 a year to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.tonido.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=1 |title=Tonidoplug 2 technical specifications |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66hziaSKf |archivedate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8897">In [[control theory]], '''robust control''' is an approach to controller design that explicitly deals with uncertainty. Robust control methods are designed to function properly provided that uncertain parameters or disturbances are found within some (typically [[compact set|compact]]) set. Robust methods aim to achieve robust performance and/or [[Stability theory|stability]] in the presence of bounded modelling errors.

The early methods of [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and others were fairly robust; the state-space methods invented in the 1960s and 1970s were sometimes found to lack robustness,&lt;ref&gt;M. Athans, Editorial on the LQG problem, IEEE Trans. Autom. Control 16 (1971), no. 6, 528.&lt;/ref&gt; prompting research to improve them. This was the start of the theory of robust control, which took shape in the 1980s and 1990s and is still active today.

In contrast with an [[adaptive control]] policy, a robust control policy is static; rather than adapting to measurements of variations, the controller is designed to work assuming that certain variables will be unknown but
bounded.&lt;ref name="Ackermann"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=J. Ackermann|Title=Robuste Regelung |Publisher=Springer-Verlag|Year=1993|Date=  1993|language=German}} (Section 1.5) In German; an English version is also available&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~morari/ Manfred Morari : Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==When is a control method said to be robust?==
Informally, a controller designed for a particular set of parameters is said to be robust if it also works well under a different set of assumptions.  High-gain feedback is a simple example of a robust control method; with sufficiently high gain, the effect of any parameter variations will be negligible. From the closed loop transfer function perspective, high open loop gain leads to substantial disturbance rejection in the face of system parameter uncertainty. Other examples on robust control include [[Sliding mode control|sliding mode]] and [[terminal sliding mode]] control.

The major obstacle to achieving high loop gains is the need to maintain system closed loop stability. Loop shaping which allows stable closed loop operation can be a technical challenge.

Robust control systems often incorporate advanced topologies which include multiple feedback loops and feed-forward paths. The control laws may be represented by high order transfer functions required to simultaneously accomplish desired disturbance rejection performance with robust closed loop operation.

High-gain feedback is the principle that allows simplified models of [[operational amplifier]]s and emitter-degenerated [[bipolar transistor]]s to be used in a variety of different settings. This idea was already well understood by [[Hendrik Wade Bode|Bode]] and [[Harold Stephen Black|Black]] in 1927.

==The modern theory of robust control==
The theory of robust control began in the late 1970s and early 1980s and soon developed a number of techniques for dealing with bounded system uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://routh.usc.edu/pub/safonov/safo97d.pdf Safonov: editorial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ee.lsu.edu/kemin/essentials.htm Kemin Zhou: Essentials of Robust Control]&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the most important example of a robust control technique is [[H-infinity loop-shaping]], which was developed by [[Duncan McFarlane]] and [[Keith Glover]] of [[Cambridge University]]; this method minimizes the [[Sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] of a system over its frequency spectrum, and this guarantees that the system will not greatly deviate from expected trajectories when disturbances enter the system.

An emerging area of robust control from application point of view is [[sliding mode control]] (SMC), which is a variation of [[variable structure control]] (VSC). The robustness properties of SMC with respect to matched uncertainty as well as the simplicity in design attracted a variety of applications.

While robust control has been traditionally dealt with along deterministic approaches, in the last two decades this approach has been criticized on the basis that it is too rigid to describe real uncertainty, while it often also leads to over conservative solutions. Probabilistic robust control has been introduced as an alternative, see e.g. &lt;ref&gt;G. Calafiore and M.C. Campi. "The scenario approach to robust control design," IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 51(5). 742-753, 2006. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1632303&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1632303]&lt;/ref&gt; that interprets robust control within the so-called [[scenario optimization]] theory.

Another example is [[Loop transformation|loop transfer recovery]] (LQG/LTR),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/skoge/book.html Multivariable Feedback Control
Analysis and Design (2nd Edition)&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed to overcome the robustness problems of [[linear-quadratic-Gaussian control]] (LQG) control.

Other robust techniques includes [[quantitative feedback theory]] (QFT), [[Passivity (engineering)|passivity based control]], [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov based control]], etc.

When system behavior varies considerably in normal operation, multiple control laws may have to be devised. Each distinct control law addresses a specific system behavior mode. An example is a computer hard disk drive. Separate robust control system modes are designed in order to address the rapid magnetic head traversal operation, known as the seek, a transitional settle operation as the magnetic head approaches its destination, and a track following mode during which the disk drive performs its data access operation.

One of the challenges is to design a control system that addresses these diverse system operating modes and enables smooth transition from one mode to the next as quickly as possible.

Such state machine driven composite control system is an extension of the gain scheduling idea where the entire control strategy changes based upon changes in system behavior.

[[Image:sediment basin EPA.jpg|thumb|right|'''Sediment basin''' installed on a construction site.]]

A '''sediment basin''' is a temporary pond built on a [[construction]] site to capture [[erosion|eroded]] or disturbed soil that is washed off during rain storms, and protect the [[water quality]] of a nearby stream, river, lake, or bay.  The [[sediment]]-laden soil settles in the pond before the runoff is discharged.  Sediment basins are typically used on construction sites of {{convert|5|acre|m2}} or more, where there is sufficient room.  They are often used in conjunction with [[erosion control]]s and other [[sediment control]] practices.  On smaller construction sites, where a basin is not practical, sediment traps may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL. [http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/nonpoint/ero_man.htm "Florida Erosion and Sediment Control Inspector's Manual: Temporary Sediment Basin."] Section 4.26. Published 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essential sediment abundance is prevalent in the construction industry which gives insight to future endeavors.

On some construction projects, the sediment basin is cleaned out after the soil disturbance (earth-moving) phase of the project, and modified to function as a permanent [[stormwater]] management system for the completed site, either as a [[detention basin]] or a [[retention basin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.

== Sediment trap ==
[[Image: Sediment trap EPA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Sediment trap''' installed on a construction site.]]

A '''sediment trap''' is a temporary [[settling basin]] installed on a [[construction]] site to capture [[erosion|eroded]] or disturbed soil that is washed off during rain storms, and protect the [[water quality]] of a nearby stream, river, lake, or bay.  The trap is basically an [[Dike (construction)|embankment]] built along a waterway or low-lying area on the site.  They are typically installed at the perimeter of a site and above [[storm drain]] inlets, to keep [[sediment]] from entering the drainage system.  Sediment traps are commonly used on small construction sites, where a sediment basin is not practical. Sediment basins are typically used on construction sites of {{convert|5|acre|m2}} or more, where there is sufficient room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA. [http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-3.pdf "California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Sediment Trap."] Fact Sheet No. SE-3. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sediment traps are installed before land disturbance (earth moving, [[land grading|grading]]) begins on a construction site.  The traps are often used in conjunction with [[erosion control]]s and other [[sediment control]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2567">'''Setting spray''' (also '''finishing spray''', '''makeup setting spray''', '''finish spray''', or '''makeup spray''') is a [[cosmetics|cosmetic]] product designed to preserve applied [[make-up]] long periods of time. Usually sold in small spray bottles, setting spray is applied by spritzing mist over the face, keeping the make-up application moist for several hours.&lt;ref name=glamour&gt;Pomerantz, Andrea.

==Industry==
Originally produced for the entertainment industry by cosmetic companies, setting sprays were developed to limit make-up reapplication for actors in [[theatre]] and [[film]].&lt;ref name=dailyglow&gt;Tinus, Donna. March 21, 2011. ''Daily Glow''. &lt;/ref&gt;

Cosmetic company [[Skindinavia]] released a consumer-facing setting spray to the market, credited as being the first to do so.&lt;ref name=dailyglow /&gt; The product, called ''Makeup Finishing Spray'', gained popularity in [[Hollywood]], where it was used on programs such as [[Project Runway]] and [[Dancing With The Stars]].&lt;ref name=dailyglow /&gt; Many celebrities adopted the use of setting sprays as well. &lt;ref name=bellasugar&gt;''BellaSugar.'' July, 22, 2011. "This Week's Top Celebrity Beauty Looks."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=glamour /&gt;

Since Skindinavia's launch, many other setting sprays have entered the market, including products made by [[Eyes Lips Face]] (J.A. Cosmetics Corp), [[Matrix (cosmetics) | Matrix]], and [[Sephora (cosmetics) | Sephora]].

==Entertainment industry==

Because setting sprays can preserve [[make-up]] through heat, sweat and physical exertion, it has become a widely used product in the entertainment industry, favored by stylists in theatre, film and television.&lt;ref name=dailyglow /&gt;

==Effectiveness==
The cosmetics industry has accepted setting sprays as a complement to powders in keeping the skin from drying for longer periods of time,&lt;ref name=cosmeticstoiletries&gt;''Cosmetics &amp; Toiletries.'' June, 2011. "Finishing Makeup".&lt;/ref&gt; however there are product reviewers who have wondered if a setting spray is effective when not wearing foundation even though it has proven effective with minimal makeup.&lt;ref name=fitness&gt;Smock, Jaclyn. ''Fitness Magazine.'' September 14, 2011. "Do Makeup Setting Mists Work?"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4443">'''Smart pipe''', related to a [[mobile network operator]] (MNO or ''operator''), refers to an operator’s network which leverages existing or unique service abilities, and the operator’s customer relationships, to provide value beyond that of data connectivity only. The use of the term “smart” refers to the operator’s ability to add value for added, and often unique, types of services and content beyond bandwidth and network speed only.

Among the commonly understood operational models for a MNO are smart pipes, [[walled garden (technology)|walled gardens]], and [[dumb pipe]]s.

== Examples ==
While there is no real [[technical standard|industry standard]] definition of a smart pipe, there are several operators, bloggers, and researchers who have described aspects of a smart pipe which are generally accepted.

Network operator [[Hutchison 3G|3]] led the way with the release of its [[X-Series (mobile broadband)|X-Series]] line of devices in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.three.co.uk/news/h3gnews/pressnewsview.omp?collcid=1019745742912&amp;cid=1163170230108&amp;index=1 Hutchison Whampoa announces the global launch of the X-Series from 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607092313/http://www.three.co.uk/news/h3gnews/pressnewsview.omp?collcid=1019745742912&amp;cid=1163170230108&amp;index=1 |date=2008-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-Series platform bundles a set of services, several of which are unique to 3, and provides unlimited data access in exchange for a fixed monthly premium. While not necessarily a full realization of a smart pipe, 3 is one of the first operators to offer such a combination of bandwidth and value-added services for flat-rate pricing.

In addition to pricing, there is a set of services commonly viewed as parts of a smart pipe,&lt;ref name="gigaom"&gt;[http://gigaom.com/2008/01/13/the-operators-vs-the-media-brands/ The Operators vs. the Media Brands]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobhappy.com/blog1/2008/01/14/the-pipe-is-only-dumb-if-you-make-it-that-way/ The Pipe is Only Dumb if You Make It that Way]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirelessweek.com/staying-relevant-in-a-dumb-pipe.aspx Staying Relevant in a Dumb Pipe Era] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070803202751/http://www.wirelessweek.com/staying-relevant-in-a-dumb-pipe.aspx |date=2007-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as: 
* [[Location-based service]]s
* [[Presence information]]
* [[Customer analytics]]
* [[Computing platform]]s, mobile or application
** [[Mobile operating system]]s
* [[User interface]]s
* [[Personalization]]
* [[Application programming interface]]s (APIs), for devices or networks
* [[Payment]], [[invoice|Billing]]
* [[Directory assistance]], directory services
* [[Quality of service]]

By exposing these types of services to the [[mobile ecosystem]], network operators can maintain the value of their pipes while enabling entrepreneurs to create new business models and generate entirely new revenue streams.

The need for operators to innovate around a smart pipe is rising as they face rising pressure from media companies&lt;ref name="gigaom"/&gt; and new technologies, such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple’s]] [[iPhone]], [[Nokia]]’s consumer portal [[Ovi (Nokia)|Ovi]], and even the open-access policies of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) introduced around its upcoming 700 MHz spectrum auction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcrnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070911/SUB/70911004/1008 Making Pipes Smart] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070626123702/http://www.rcrnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070911/SUB/70911004/1008 |date=2007-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, [[Arun Sarin]], CEO of [[Vodafone]], was criticized for some statements he made about how [[Vodafone]] will always have a unique relationship with its subscribers through its billing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/19/vodafone_ceo_blind/ Vodafone CEO sticks head in sand, goes 'La la la']&lt;/ref&gt; Although Sarin’s point has been true traditionally, as the article points out there are several new threats to that exclusivity such as traditional credit card, [[Obopay]], [[PayPal|PayPal Mobile]], and existing media companies like [[Google]] via the [[Android (operating system)|Android platform]], [[Yahoo]] via [[Yahoo! Go|Go]], and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] via [[iPhone]].

[[Image:Spurs cowboy crockett.jpg|thumbnail|right|225px|Western-style cowboy spurs with rowels, chap guards and buttons for the spur straps]]
A '''spur''' is a metal tool designed to be worn in pairs on the heels of [[riding boot]]s for the purpose of directing a [[horse]] or other animal to move forward or laterally while riding. It is usually used to refine the [[riding aids]] (commands) and to back up the natural aids (the leg, seat, hands, and voice). The spur is used in many equestrian disciplines. Most equestrian organizations have rules in about spur design and use and penalties for using spurs in any manner that constitutes [[animal abuse]].

==Etymology==
This very old word derives from Anglo-Saxon ''spura, spora'', related to ''spornan, spurnan'', to kick, ''spurn''; cf. Medieval High German ''Sporn'', modern German ''Sporn'', Dutch ''spoor'', Frisian ''spoar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=spur|title=spur - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The generalized sense of "anything that urges on, stimulus" is recorded in English from'' circa'' 1390.

==Design==
[[Image:SpurDiagram.svg|thumb|left|Parts of a simple spur]]
The parts of a spur include:
*The "yoke", "branch", or "heel band", which wraps around the heel of the boot.
*The "shank" or "neck", which extends from the back of the yoke and is the area that touches the horse.  
*The rowel, seen on some spurs, a revolving [[wheel]] or disk with radiating "points" at the end attached to the shank.

[[Image:spur.png|thumb|Spur straps on an English "Prince of Wales" spur]]

Spurs are usually held on by a leather or leather-like spur strap that goes over the arch of the foot and under the sole in front of the boot heel.  Some western designs have a leather strap that goes only over the top, with a heel chain or a rubber "tiedown" instead of a strap under the boot.  Also, some  styles have no straps, where the heel band is simply very tight and slips on wedged between the sole and heel of the boot.  Some spur designs have a slot for running the spur strap through, others have "buttons",  sometimes on the heel band itself and sometimes attached to the heel band by hinges that allow a strap with buttonholes to be attached.

When used in military ranks, senior officers, and officers of all ranks in [[cavalry]] and other formerly mounted units of some armies, wear a form of spur in certain orders of dress which is known as the box spur, having no spur strap, but a long metal prong opposite the neck, extending between the arms of the heel band, which is inserted into a specially fitted recess or "box" in the base of the boot heel. Due to the prong, such spurs can only be worn with appropriately equipped boots. This construction is shown in the photos of the swan neck and Waterford spurs below.

Spurs seen in [[western riding]] may also have small curved-up hooks on the shank in front of the rowel, called "chap guards", that were originally used to prevent the rider's [[chaps]] from interfering with the rowels of the spur. The shank angle from the yoke can vary from "full" to "one half" to "one quarter" to "straight". Some [[cowboy]]s also added small metal ''pajados,'' also known as ''jingo bobs'' or ''jingle bobs,'' near the rowel, to create a jingling sound whenever the foot moved.  Rowels can vary in size and number of points.

In the history of [[veterinary science]], the word "rowel" described a small disk of [[leather]] or other material that was used as a [[seton stitch]].

==History==
[[File:Rowel Spur MET DT760.jpg|thumb|"Rowel spur", ''circa'' 1400 [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rowel_Spur_MET_DT760.jpg Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]
[[File:Spur rowel detail.jpg|thumb|Western spur rowel with jingo bobs]]
The spur was used by the [[Celtic people|Celts]] during the [[La Tène]] period (which began in the fifth century BC), and is also mentioned by [[Xenophon]] (''circa'' 430 - 354 BC.)&lt;ref&gt;p. 115, ''An early history of horsemanship'', Augusto Azzaroli, Brill, 1985, {{ISBN|90-04-07233-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"La Tène", entry, p. 353, ''A dictionary of archaeology'', Ian Shaw and Robert Jameson, 6th illustrated ed., Wiley-Blackwell, 2002, {{ISBN|0-631-23583-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   Iron or bronze spurs were also used throughout the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 82, ''Handbook to life in ancient Rome'', Roy A. Adkins, reprint ed., Oxford University Press US, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-512332-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The spur also existed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Riding the Horse, Writing the Cultural Myth: The European Knight and the American Cowboy as Equestrian Heroes|author=Metin Boşnak, Cem Ceyhan|journal=Turkish Journal of International Relations|volume=2|issue=1|date=Fall 2003|pages=157–181 [175]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early spurs had a neck that ended in a point, called a prick, riveted to the heel band.  Prick spurs had straight necks in the 11th century and bent ones in the 12th. The earliest form of the spur armed the heel with a single prick. In England, the rowel spur is shown upon the first seal of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] and on [[monument]]s of the 13th century, but it did not come into general use until the 14th century.   The earliest rowels probably did not revolve, but were fixed.

The spurs of medieval [[knight]]s were [[Gilding|gilt]] and those of [[squire]]s were silvered.{{fact|date=January 2015}}  To "win his spurs" meant to gain knighthood, as gilded spurs were reckoned the badge of knighthood.{{fact|date=January 2015}} In the rare cases of [[Cashiering|ceremonious degradation]], the spurs were hacked from the disgraced knight's heels with the cook's chopper.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} After the [[battle of the Golden Spurs]] in 1302, where the French chivalry suffered a humbling defeat, the victors hung up bushels of knights' gilt spurs in the churches of [[Kortrijk]] as trophies of what is still remembered by the Flemings as the ''Guldensporenslag'' (the battle of the golden spurs). The English named the French [[rout]] from [[Thérouanne]] as the [[Battle of the Spurs]], due to the rapidity of the French cavalry's flight.

Prick spurs were the standard form until the 14th century, when the rowel began to become more common.  The prick design never died out entirely, but instead became a thicker, shorter neck with a dulled end, such as the modern "Prince of Wales" design commonly seen in [[English riding]].

Though often decorated throughout history, in the 15th century, spurs became an art form in both decoration and design, with elaborate engraving, very long shanks, and large rowels.  Though sometimes it has been claimed that the design changes were used because of [[barding]], the use of barding had fallen out of fashion by the time the most elaborate spur designs were created. More likely, the elaborate designs reflected the increased abundance of precious metals, particularly [[silver]], that followed the European exploration of the [[Americas]] that began in 1492.  Spur designs in Spain and colonial [[Mexico]] were particularly elaborate.  For example, the spurs of the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]es'' were sometimes called ''espuela grande,'' the "grand spur", and could have rowels as large as 6 inches around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquesjournal.com/Pages04/archives/spurs.html Overton, Joice.  "Collecting Cowboy Spurs"  ''New England Antiques Journal''.]  Web page accessed October 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern Europe, the spur became less elaborate after the 16th century, particularly following the [[Stuart Restoration]], but elaborate spur designs persisted, particularly in the Americas, descendants of which are still seen today, particularly in Mexico and the western [[United States]], where  the spur has become an integral part of the ''[[vaquero]]'' and [[cowboy]] traditions.  The spur as an art form, as well as a tool, is still seen in [[western riding]], where spurs with engraving and other artistic elements, often handmade and using silver or other precious metals, are still worn.

Collecting of particularly beautiful [[antique]] spurs is a popular pastime for some individuals, particularly aficionados of western history and cowboy culture.

===Spurs as modern honours===
Just as a [[medieval]] [[knight]] was said to have "earned his spurs",  the awarding of spurs has continued in the modern era as an honour bestowed upon individuals in organizations with military heritages, and among motorcycle riders.  Members of the [[Papal Orders of Knighthood]] receive gilt spurs directly from the hands of the [[pope]]; members of the British [[Order of the Garter]] similarly receive gilt spurs from the monarch.  Inductees into the American [[Order of the Spur]] receive gold-coloured (usually brass) spurs if they have earned their membership through combat, or silver-coloured (usually nickel) spurs if they have not seen combat, but complete a [[rite of passage]].

==Basic designs and wear==
Spurs are worn with the tip of the neck pointed downward, sitting on the spur rest of the [[riding boot]], if there is one, with the buckle of the spur strap worn on the outside of the foot.

Spur styles differ between disciplines. Spurs for western riding tend to be heavier, often decorated, and have rowels that rotate. The neck of western spurs is usually longer and the rowel wide in diameter, to accommodate the leg position of the western-style rider, where the [[stirrup]] is adjusted long, and the heavy leather used for the [[saddle]]'s fenders and stirrups places the rider's leg a bit farther from the horse.

[[Image:Spur2.jpg|thumb|right|240px|English riding spur]]
Spurs in [[English riding]] tend to be very sleek, slim, and conservative in design, with a shorter neck, as the saddle and leg position is closer to the horse. They usually have a rounded or blunt end.  Rowels are not as popular as the plain blunt end, although some types include a rowel or smooth disk on the end.  When used in sports requiring finesse, such as [[dressage]], the spur's purpose is not to speed up the horse, but to give accurate and precise [[riding aids|aids]] in lateral and complex movements, such as pirouettes, ''travers'', and ''renvers'', and the [[airs above the ground]].  Dressage riders tend to ride in Waterford- style spurs with a rounded knob at the end.  Conversely, [[show hunter]] and [[show jumping|jumper]] riders may use a flatter end to encourage forward movement, such as the Prince of Wales design.

[[Image:Motorcycle spurs.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Motorcycle spurs from Loop Spurs]]
Another type of modern spur is those used on [[motorcycle]]s.  They are characterized by rowels worn as foot jewelry, hung off of boots.  They can be similar in appearance to spurs worn by equestrians.  Their bright material attracts motor vehicle drivers to the presence of motorcyclists, especially to their feet where riders are most vulnerable when stopped in traffic.{{dubious|date=August 2018}} Their owners may further customize them by adding miniature strobing [[LED]] lights. &lt;!-- They help traffic light sensors detect their presence in intersections where inductive loops are used.{{Cn|date=November 2014}} --&gt; They are also awarded by motorcycle clubs.

==Equestrian use==
The spur is a refined tool, designed to allow the rider to transmit very subtle signals to the horse that are nearly invisible to any other observer.  No matter the discipline, it is important that a rider has a correct position before using spurs, with a deep seat, legs lengthened to the extent allowed by the [[stirrup]]s, heels down, with knees and thighs rolled in so that the rider has a solid base of support.   A swinging or unstable leg may inadvertently jab the horse with the spur as the rider sits, thus irritating, harming, and frightening the horse, and chronic misuse may deaden it to the leg aids.  Improper use may also provoke dangerous or undesirable behaviors such as [[bucking]] or running away.

Spurs are rarely used in sports such as [[horse racing]], where the rider's leg is not significantly in contact with the horse.

Most spurs are activated by the rider flexing the heel slightly up and in.  A roweled spur permits an additional type of action; a rider can roll the spur lightly against the side of the horse rather than being limited to simply pressing inward.

===Rodeo spurring===
[[File:Barrel racing spur pair.jpg|thumb|A pair of barrel-racing spurs with unique nonrowel design]]
The exception to the use of spurs in a subtle fashion is in the [[rodeo]] events of [[bull riding]] and [[saddle bronc and bareback riding]], where the rider is required to spur in an elaborate, stylized fashion, touching the horse or bull at every stride.  This requirement is designed to resemble the behavior of old-time horse-breakers, who would deliberately provoke a horse to buck. In modern times, riders are required to use spurs in a manner that is merely encouraging a horse that is already predisposed to buck; they are not to produce pain.  Spur design and use is strictly defined by rodeo rules, spurs are dull, and rowels must turn freely.  In fact, the way spurs are to be used in bucking events generally makes it harder for the rider to stay on; in bareback bronc competition, the spurs must be above the point of the horse's shoulder at the first jump and remain forward at all times, deliberately creating a very awkward position for the rider that requires both strength and coordination to stay on the horse.  In saddle-bronc competition, the rider must make a full sweep with the spurs from shoulder to flank with each jump, requiring great concentration, and any error in balance puts the rider in a position to be quickly unseated.  Bull riders are allowed a position that is the closest to that of classic riding, they are not required to spur the bull, but if they choose to spur, may do so with their legs down in a style that resembles a normal riding position.

==Types==
[[Image:Ep gdgalle.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Prince of Wales]]
[[Image:Ep molettelisse.jpg|right|thumb|130px|Disc]]
[[Image:Klack- eller skruvsporre, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|thumb|130px|Swan neck, rowels]]
[[Image:Danssporre, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|thumb|130px|Waterford spur]]
Spurs are divided into men's, women's, and children's, according to width (which must fit on the heel of the rider's boot). Spurs are further divided according to the length of the neck, with {{convert|1/4|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} being relatively small (and a common size in children's spurs), with some being 2–3&amp;nbsp;in (5–7.5&amp;nbsp;cm) long.  Many competition rules limit the length of the neck.

* Round end: The end is a metal ball about the size of a small marble, making it one of the milder spurs.
* Knob end: The end of the spur is squared off, but blunted at the edges.
* Prince of Wales: This style has a flat end, making it slightly sharper. It is a popular spur style.
* Rowelled spur: The end of the spur has a toothed wheel which spins. This is the most common western-style spur, although it is seen on some English-style spurs. Teeth are dulled at the points.  A rowel with many small teeth is milder than one with only a few, larger teeth. Most rowels have at least eight teeth on each wheel. Other variations, more common in English riding, include:
** Disc: The end has a small rowel-like rolling disc without teeth, which allows the spur to roll on the horse's side when applied, decreasing chance of spur marks. Popular in dressage, its severity depends on the thickness of the disc.
**Roller spur: The end of the neck has a plastic "roller," which moves as the horse's side is touched. This spur tends to reduce spur-rubs on sensitive horses. It is considered very mild.
* Swan neck: The neck of the spur goes upward at an angle, before leveling off, looking similar to the neck of a swan. This is commonly seen in dressage.
* Waterford: The end of the neck has a large, round, metal ball, making the spur softer and less likely to cause spur rubs.
*'' Le spur'' (English) or barrel-racing spur (western): The spur has small "teeth" or ridges on the inside of the heel band, instead of a neck.  For use, the rider does not have to turn in the heel.  A quicker and more subtle design, it is also more apt to be accidentally used when not intended.
* Half-mounted: The spur is decorated on one side only with silver, copper, or bronze decals, logos, or coverings.
* Full-mounted or double-mounted: The spur is decorated on both sides (in and out) with precious metals, images, and designs.

The '''Stack Resource Policy''' (SRP)  is a resource allocation policy used in real-time computing, used for accessing shared resources when using [[earliest deadline first scheduling]]. It was defined by T. P. Baker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=T. P.|title=A Stack-Based Resource Allocation Policy for Realtime Processes|journal=IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium|year=1990|pages=191–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; SRP is not the same as the [[Priority ceiling protocol]] which is for fixed priority tasks (FP).
== Function ==

Each task is assigned a preemption level based upon the following formula where &lt;math&gt; D(T_i) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the deadline of task &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \pi_i(T_i) &lt;/math&gt; denotes the preemption level of task i:

&lt;math&gt; D(T_i) &lt; D(T_j) \iff \pi_i(T_i) &gt; \pi_i(T_j) &lt;/math&gt;

Each resource R has a current ceiling &lt;math&gt; C_R(V_R) &lt;/math&gt; that represents the maximum of the preemption levels of the tasks that may be blocked, when there are &lt;math&gt; V &lt;/math&gt; units of &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; available and &lt;math&gt; \mu_R(J) &lt;/math&gt; is the maximum units of &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt; T_i &lt;/math&gt; may require at any one time. &lt;math&gt; C_R(V_R) &lt;/math&gt; is assigned as follows: 

&lt;math&gt; C_R(V_R) = max(\{0\} \cup \{\pi(J) | V_R &lt; \mu_R(J)\}) &lt;/math&gt;

There is also a system ceiling &lt;math&gt; \pi' &lt;/math&gt; which is the maximum of all current ceilings of the resources.

&lt;math&gt; \pi' = max(\{C_R(i) | i = 1,...,m\} \cup \{\pi(J_c)\}) &lt;/math&gt;

Any task &lt;math&gt; T_i &lt;/math&gt; that wishes to preempt the system must first satisfy the following constraint:

&lt;math&gt; \pi' &lt; P_i(T_i) &lt;/math&gt;

This can be refined for Operating System implementation (as in [[MarteOS]]) by removing the multi-unit resources and defining the stack resource policy as follows
* All tasks are assigned a preemption level, in order to preserve the ordering of tasks in relation to each other when locking resources. The lowest relative deadline tasks are assigned the highest preemption level.
* Each shared resource has an associated ceiling level, which is the maximum preemption level of all the tasks that access this protected object.
* The system ceiling, at any instant in time, is the maximum active priority of all the tasks that are currently executing within the system.
* A task is only allowed to preempt the system when its absolute deadline is less than the currently executing task and its preemption level is higher than the current system ceiling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28225">A '''standards organization''', '''standards body''', '''standards developing organization''' ('''SDO'''), or '''standards setting organization''' ('''SSO''') is an organization whose primary activities are developing, coordinating, promulgating, revising, amending, reissuing, interpreting, or otherwise producing [[technical standard]]s&lt;ref name="Ping" /&gt; that are intended to address the needs of a group of affected adopters.

Most standards are voluntary in the sense that they are offered for adoption by people or industry without being mandated in law. Some standards become mandatory when they are adopted by regulators as legal requirements in particular domains.

The term ''formal standard'' refers specifically to a specification that has been approved by a standards setting organization.  The term ''[[de jure standard]]'' refers to a standard mandated by legal requirements or refers generally to any formal standard. In contrast, the term ''[[de facto standard]]'' refers to a specification (or protocol or technology) that has achieved widespread use and acceptance – often without being approved by any standards organization (or receiving such approval only after it already has achieved widespread use). Examples of de facto standards that were not approved by any standards organizations (or at least not approved until after they were in widespread ''de facto'' use) include the [[Hayes command set]] developed by [[Hayes Microcomputer Products|Hayes]], [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[TrueType]] font design and the [[Printer Command Language|PCL]] protocol used by [[Hewlett-Packard]] in the [[computer printer]]s they produced.

Normally, the term ''standards organization'' is not used to refer to the individual parties participating within the standards developing organization in the capacity of founders, [[benefactor (law)|benefactors]], [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]], members or contributors, who themselves may function as the standards organizations.

==History==

===Standardization===
[[File:JFIScrewThread300.png|thumb|right|Graphic representation of formulae for the pitches of threads of screw bolts]]
The implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly important with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the need for high-precision [[machine tool]]s and [[interchangeable parts]]. [[Henry Maudslay]] developed the first industrially practical [[screw-cutting lathe]] in 1800, which allowed for the standardisation of [[screw thread]] sizes for the first time.&lt;ref name="Ping"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/econwp117.pdf|title=A Brief History of Standards and Standardization Organizations: A Chinese Perspective|author=Wang Ping|publisher=[[East–West Center]] |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maudslay's work, as well as the contributions of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards spread a bit within their industries. [[Joseph Whitworth]]'s screw thread measurements were adopted as the  first (unofficial) national standard by companies around the country in 1841. It came to be known as the [[British Standard Whitworth]], and was widely adopted in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, K. R., &amp; Galloway, D. F., 1978, "Machine Tools". In [[Charles Singer]], et al., (Eds.), ''A History of Technology''. Oxford, Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Lee|Lee, Sidney]] (Ed.), 1900, ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=tzsJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vol LXI]. Smith Elder, London&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early standards organizations===
By the end of the 19th century differences in standards between companies was making trade increasingly difficult and strained. For instance, an iron and steel dealer recorded his displeasure in ''[[The Times]]'': "Architects and engineers generally specify such unnecessarily diverse types of sectional material or given work that anything like  economical and continuous manufacture becomes impossible. In this country no two professional men are agreed upon the size and weight of a [[girder]] to employ for given work".

The [[BSI Group|Engineering Standards Committee]] was established in London in 1901 as the world's first national standards body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/upload/Corporate%20Marketing/Financial%20Performance/BSI_Group_Annual_Report_and_Financial_Statements_2010.pdf |title=BSI Group Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010, p. 2|format=PDF|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert C McWilliam 2001"&gt;Robert C. McWilliam. ''BSI: The First Hundred Years. 1901–2001. A Century of Achievement''. 2001. Thanet Press. London&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently extended its standardization work and became the British Engineering Standards Association in 1918, adopting the name British Standards Institution in 1931 after receiving its Royal Charter in 1929. The national standards were adopted universally throughout the country, and enabled the markets to act more rationally and efficiently, with an increased level of cooperation.

After the [[First World War]], similar national bodies were established in other countries. The [[Deutsches Institut für Normung]] was set up in Germany in 1917, followed by its counterparts, the American [[American National Standards Institute|National Standard Institute]] and the French  [[AFNOR|Commission Permanente de Standardisation]], both in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ping" /&gt;

===International organizations===
[[File:crompton.jpg|thumb|right|[[R. E. B. Crompton]] drew up the first international standards body, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], in 1906.]]
By the mid to late 19th century, efforts were being made to standardize electrical measurement. An important figure was R. E. B. Crompton, who became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century. Many companies had entered the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for [[volt]]age, [[frequency]], [[Electric current|current]] and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams. Adjacent buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because they had been fitted out by different companies. Crompton could see the lack of efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international standard for electric engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm ''Colonel Crompton''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903145102/http://www.iec.ch/about/history/articles/colonel_crompton.htm |date=2010-09-03 }}, IEC Website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Crompton represented Britain at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St.&amp;nbsp;Louis]], [[Missouri]], as part of a delegation by the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]]. He presented a paper on standardisation, which was so well received that he was asked to look into the formation of a commission to oversee the process.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. &amp; Randell, W. (1948) ''Colonel Crompton and the Evolution of the Electrical Industry'', Longman Green.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1906 his work was complete and he drew up a permanent constitution for the first international standards organization, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAi_QBsTz5UC|title=Encyclopedia of Electrochemical Power Sources|author1=Chris K. Dyer |author2=Patrick T. Moseley |author3=Zempachi Ogumi |author4=David A. J. Rand |author5=Bruno Scrosati Newnes | year=2010|page=540}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body held its first meeting that year in London, with representatives from 14 countries. In honour of his contribution to electrical standardisation, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] was elected as the body's first President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/documents/pdf/IEC_Founding_Meeting_Report_1906.pdf | title=1906 Preliminary Meeting Report, pp. 46–48 | work=The minutes from our first meeting | author=IEC | accessdate=21 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memory plaque of founding ISA in Prague cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial plaque of founding ISA in [[Prague]].]]
The [[ISO|International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations]] (ISA) was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation for all technical standards and specifications. The body was suspended in 1942 during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]].

After the war, ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee (UNSCC) with a proposal to form a new global standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in [[London]] and agreed to join forces to create the new [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO); the new organization officially began operations in February&amp;nbsp;1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/about%20ISO/docs/en/Friendship_among_equals.pdf|title=Friendship among equals - Recollections from ISO's first fifty years|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|year=1997|isbn=92-67-10260-5|pages=15–18|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Standards organizations can be classified by their role, position, and the extent of their influence on the local, national, regional, and global standardization arena.

By geographic designation, there are international, regional, and national standards bodies (the latter often referred to as NSBs). By technology or industry designation, there are standards developing organizations (SDOs) and also standards setting organizations (SSOs) also known as consortia.  Standards organizations may be governmental, quasi-governmental or non-governmental entities.  Quasi- and non-governmental standards organizations are often non-profit organizations.

=== International standards organizations ===
Broadly, an international standards organization develops [[international standards]]. (This does not necessarily restrict the use of other published standards internationally.)

There are many international standards organizations. The three largest and most well-established such organizations are the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], and the [[International Telecommunication Union]], which have each existed for more than 50 years (founded in 1947, 1906, and 1865, respectively) and are all based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. They have established tens of thousands of standards covering almost every conceivable topic. Many of these are then adopted worldwide replacing various incompatible "homegrown" standards. Many of these standards are naturally evolved from those designed in-house within an industry, or by a particular country, while others have been built from scratch by groups of experts who sit on various technical committees (TCs). These three organizations together comprise the [[World Standards Cooperation]] (WSC) alliance.

ISO is composed of the national standards bodies (NSBs), one per member economy. The IEC is similarly composed of national committees, one per member economy.  In some cases, the national committee to the IEC of an economy may also be the ISO member from that country or economy. ISO and IEC are private international organizations that are not established by any international treaty.  Their members may be non-governmental organizations or governmental agencies, as selected by ISO and IEC (which are privately established organizations).

The ITU is a treaty-based organization established as a permanent agency of the [[United Nations]], in which governments are the primary members,{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} although other organizations (such as non-governmental organizations and individual companies) can also hold a form of direct membership status in the ITU as well. Another example of a treaty-based international standards organization with government membership is the [[Codex Alimentarius|Codex Alimentarius Commission]].

In addition to these, a large variety of independent international standards organizations such as the [[ASME]], the [[ASTM International]], the [[IEEE]], the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), [[SAE International]], [[TAPPI]], the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), and the [[Universal Postal Union]] (UPU) develop and publish standards for a variety of international uses.  In many such cases, these international standards organizations are not based on the principle of one member per country.  Rather, membership in such organizations is open to those interested in joining and willing to agree to the organization's by-laws – having either organizational/corporate or individual technical experts as members.

The Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) was formed in 1949 to prepare avionics system engineering standards with other aviation organizations RTCA, EUROCAE, and ICAO. The standards are widely known as the ARINC Standards.

=== Regional standards organizations ===
Regional standards bodies also exist, such as the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN), the [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization]] (CENELEC), the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), and the [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements]] (IRMM) in Europe, the [[Pacific Area Standards Congress]] (PASC), the [[Pan American Standards Commission]] (COPANT), the [[African Organisation for Standardisation]] (ARSO), the [[Arabic industrial development and mining organization]] (AIDMO), and others.

In the European Union, only standards created by CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI are recognized as ''European standards'', and member states are required to notify the European Commission and each other about all the draft technical regulations concerning ICT products and services before they are adopted in national law.&lt;ref name="euDir98_34"&gt;European Union: [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31998L0034:en:NOT Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations] ''Official Journal L'' é04, 21.7.1998, p. 37–48. (This page also provides references to amendments.) See also European Commission: Enterprise Directorate-General: [http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/standards_policy/vademecum/doc/98_34_ec_consolidated_version.pdf Vademecum on European Standardisation]. (This document contains a consolidated version of Directive 98/34/EC, dated 15 November 2003.) Accessed 2009-05-05.&lt;/ref&gt; These rules were laid down in Directive 98/34/EC with the goal of providing transparency and control with regard to technical regulations.&lt;ref name="euDir98_34"/&gt;

Sub-regional standards organizations also exist such as the [[MERCOSUR]] Standardization Association (AMN), the [[CARICOM Regional Organisation for Standards and Quality]] (CROSQ), and the ASEAN Consultative Committee for Standards and Quality (ACCSQ), EAC East Africa Standards Committee [[www.eac-quality.net]], and the [[GCC Standardization Organization|GCC Standardization Organization (GSO)]] for [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]].

=== National standards bodies ===
In general, each country or economy has a single recognized national standards body (NSB). A national standards body is likely the sole member from that economy in ISO; ISO currently has 161 members. National standards bodies usually do not prepare the technical content of standards, which instead is developed by national technical societies.

NSBs may be either public or private sector organizations, or combinations of the two.  For example, the Standards Council of Canada is a Canadian [[Crown Corporation]], Dirección General de Normas is a governmental agency within the Mexican Ministry of Economy, and ANSI is a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit U.S. organization with members from both the private and public sectors.  The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), the U.S. government's standards agency, cooperates with ANSI under a [[memorandum of understanding]] to collaborate on the United States Standards Strategy.  The determinates of whether an NSB for a particular economy is a public or private sector body may include the historical and traditional roles that the private sector fills in public affairs in that economy or the development stage of that economy.

=== Standards developing organizations (SDOs) ===
Whereas, the term ''national standards body'' (NSB) generally refers to the one-per-country standardization organization that is that country’s member of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], the term ''standards developing organization'' (SDO) generally refers to the thousands of industry- or sector-based standards organizations that develop and publish industry specific standards.  Some economies feature only an NSB with no other SDOs. Large economies like the United States and Japan have several hundred SDOs, many of which are coordinated by the central NSBs of each country (ANSI and JISC in this case). In some cases, international industry-based SDOs such as the [[IEEE]] and the [[Audio Engineering Society]] (AES) may have direct liaisons with international standards organizations, having input to international standards without going through a national standards body. SDOs are differentiated from standards setting organizations (SSOs) in that SDOs may be accredited to develop standards using open and transparent processes.

=== Scope of work ===
Developers of technical standards are generally concerned with [[interface standard]]s, which detail how products interconnect with each other, and [[safety standards]], which established characteristics ensure that a product or process is safe for humans, animals, and the environment. The subject of their work can be narrow or broad. Another area of interest is in defining how the behavior and performance of products is measured and described in data sheets.

Overlapping or competing standards bodies tend to cooperate purposefully, by seeking to define boundaries between the scope of their work, and by operating in a hierarchical fashion in terms of national, regional and international scope; international organizations tend to have as members national organizations; and standards emerging at national level (such as [[ISO 9000|BS 5750]]) can be adopted at regional levels (BS 5750 was adopted as EN 29000) and at international levels (BS 5750 was adopted as ISO 9000).

Unless adopted by a government, standards carry no force in law. However, most jurisdictions have [[False advertising|truth in advertising]] laws, and ambiguities can be reduced if a company offers a product that is "compliant" with a standard.

=== Standards development process ===
When an organization develops standards that may be used openly, it is common to have formal rules published regarding the process. This may include:
* Who is allowed to vote and provide input on new or revised standards
* What is the formal step-by-step process
* How are bias and commercial interests handled
* How negative votes or ballots are handled
* What type of consensus is required

Though it can be a tedious and lengthy process, formal standard setting is essential to developing new technologies. For example, since 1865, the telecommunications industry has depended on the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] to establish the telecommunications standards that have been adopted worldwide. The ITU has created numerous telecommunications standards including telegraph specifications, allocation of telephone numbers, interference protection, and protocols for a variety of communications technologies. The standards that are created through standards organizations lead to improved product quality, ensured [[interoperability]] of competitors’ products, and they provide a technological baseline for future research and product development. Formal standard setting through standards organizations has numerous benefits for consumers including increased innovation, multiple market participants, reduced production costs, and the efficiency effects of product interchangeability.

=== Standards distribution and copyright ===
Some standards – such as the [[Schools Interoperability Framework|SIF Specification]] in K12 education – are managed by a non-profit organizations composed of public entities and private entities working in cooperation that then publish the standards under an open license at no charge and requiring no registration.

A technical library at a university may have copies of technical standards on hand. Major libraries in large cities may also have access to many technical standards.

Some users of standards mistakenly assume that all standards are in the [[public domain]]. This assumption is correct only for standards produced by the [[central government]]s whose publications are not amenable to [[copyright]] or to organizations that issue their standard under an open license. Any standards produced by non-governmental entities remain the [[intellectual property]] of their developers (unless specifically designed otherwise) and are protected, just like any other [[publication]]s, by [[copyright]] laws and international [[treaties]]. However, the intellectual property extends only to the standard itself and not to its use. For instance if a company sells a device that is compliant with a given standard, it is not liable for further payment to the standards organization except in the special case when the organization holds patent rights or some other ownership of the intellectual property described in the standard.

It is, however, liable for any patent infringement by its implementation, just as with any other implementation of technology. The standards organizations give no guarantees that patents relevant to a given standard have been identified. ISO standards draw attention to this in the foreword with a statement like the following: "Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from ISO/IEC 24751-1:2008: ''Information technology – Individualized adaptability and accessibility in e-learning, education and training – Part 1: Framework and reference model'', p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; If the standards organization is aware that parts of a given standard fall under patent protection, it will often require the patent holder to agree to [[Reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing]] before including it in the standard. Such an agreement is regarded as a legally binding contract,&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''The Meaning of FRAND, Part I: Royalties'', 9 J. COMPETITION L. &amp; ECON. 931, 977 (2013), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/meaning-of-frand-royalties-for-standard-essential-patents.html.&lt;/ref&gt; as in the 2012 case ''[[Microsoft v. Motorola]]''.

== Trends ==
The ever-quickening pace of technology evolution is now more than ever affecting the way new standards are proposed, developed and implemented.

Since traditional, widely respected standards organizations tend to operate at a slower pace than technology evolves, many standards they develop are becoming less relevant because of the inability of their developers to keep abreast with the technological innovation. As a result, a new class of standards setters appeared on the [[standardization]] arena: the '''industry consortia''' or standards setting organizations (SSOs). Despite having limited financial resources, some of them enjoy truly international acceptance. One example is the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), whose standards for [[HTML]], [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], and [[XML]] are used universally. There are also community-driven associations such as the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a worldwide network of volunteers who collaborate to set standards for lower-level software solutions.

Some industry-driven standards development efforts don't even have a formal organizational structure. They are projects funded by large corporations. Among them are the [[OpenOffice.org]], an [[Apache Software Foundation]]-sponsored international community of volunteers working on an [[open standard|open-standard]] software that aims to compete with [[Microsoft Office]], and two commercial groups competing fiercely with each other to develop an industry-wide standard for [[DVD|high-density optical storage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4760">[[Image:Skinner teaching machine 01.jpg|thumb|right|Skinner's teaching machine, a mechanical device to control student progress in [[programmed instruction]]]]

'''Teaching machines''' were originally [[wikt:mechanical|mechanical]] devices. They presented educational materials and taught students. They were first invented by [[Sidney L. Pressey]] in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Pressey's priority is supported by [[Ernest Hilgard]] in Hilgard E.R. 1966. Learning &amp; the technology of instruction. Chapter 16 in Hilgard E.R. &amp; Bower G.H. 1966. ''Theories of learning''. 3rd ed, New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, p554{{ndash}}561 Programmed learning.&lt;/ref&gt; His machine originally administered [[multiple-choice]] questions. The machine could be set so it moved on only when the student got the right answer. Tests showed that learning had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1926. A simple apparatus which gives tests and scores {{ndash}} and teaches. ''School and Society'', '''23''' (586), 373–376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pressey S.L. 1927. A machine for automatic teaching of drill material. ''School and Society'', '''25''' (645), 549–552.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=P1932&gt;Pressey S.L. 1932. A third and fourth contribution toward the coming "industrial revolution" in education. ''School and Society'', '''36''' (934), 668–672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pressey 1950. Development and appraisal of devices providing immediate automatic scoring of objective tests and concomitant self instruction. ''Journal of Psychology'', '''29''', 417{{ndash}}447.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an example of how [[knowledge of results]] causes learning. Much later, [[Norman Crowder (psychologist)|Norman Crowder]] developed the Pressey idea further.&lt;ref&gt;Crowder N. 1959. Automatic tutoring by means of intrinsic programming. In Galanter E.H. (ed) ''Automatic teaching: the state of the art''. New York: Wiley, 109{{ndash}}116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crowder Norman A. 1960. Automatic tutoring by intrinsic programming. In Lumsdaine A.A &amp; Glaser R. (eds) 1960. ''Teaching machines and programed learning I: a source book''. Washington D.C. National Education Association of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B.F. Skinner]] was responsible for a different type of machine called GLIDER, which used his ideas on how learning should be directed with positive [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Skinner B.F. 1965. ''The technology of teaching''. Appleton-Century-Croft. Includes reprints of all his papers on programmed learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, "learning by doing".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner B.F. 1961. Teaching machines. S''cientific American'', '''205''', 90-112. doi:10.2307/1926170, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner B.F. and Holland J. 1961. ''The analysis of behavior: a program for self instruction''. p.387.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is extensive experience that both methods worked well, and so did [[programmed learning]] in other forms, such as books.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser R. (ed) 1965. ''Teaching machines and programed learning II: data and directions''. Washington D.C. National Education Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ideas of teaching machines and programmed learning provided the basis for later ideas such as [[open learning]] and [[computer-assisted instruction]].

*Illustrations of early teaching machines can be found in  the main sourcebook.&lt;ref&gt;Lumsdaine A.A &amp; Glaser R. (eds) 1960. ''Teaching machines and programed learning I: a source book''. Washington D.C. National Education Association of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==
*[[Edward L. Thorndike]] in 1912: "If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print".&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike E.L. 1912. ''Education: a first book''. New York: Macmillan, p165.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pressey in 1932: "Education was the one major activity in this country which has thus far not systematically applied ingenuity to the solution of its problems". (p. 668). He thought the machine he developed would lead to an "industrial revolution in education" (p. 672).&lt;ref name=P1932/&gt;

A '''thermostatic mixing valve''' (TMV) is a [[valve]] that blends hot water with cold water to ensure constant, safe shower and bath outlet temperatures, preventing [[burn#Scald|scalding]].

The storage of water at high temperature removes one possible breeding ground for [[Legionella]]; the use of a [[thermostat]], rather than a static mixing valve, provides increased safety against scalding, and increased user comfort, because the hot-water temperature remains constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermostatic mixing valve|journal=Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning Engineering|date=2012|volume=84|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many TMVs use a [[Wax_thermostatic_element|wax thermostat]] for regulation. They also shut off rapidly in the event of a hot or cold supply failure to prevent scalding or thermal shock. 

It is increasingly common practice around the world to regulate the storage water temperature to above 60&amp;nbsp;°C (140&amp;nbsp;°F), and to circulate or distribute water at a temperature less than 50&amp;nbsp;°C (122&amp;nbsp;°F). Water above these temperatures can cause scald injuries.  Many countries, states, or municipalities now require that the temperature of all bath water in newly built and extensively refurbished domestic properties be controlled to a maximum of 48&amp;nbsp;°C (118&amp;nbsp;°F). Installing thermostatic mixing valves can ensure that water is delivered at the required temperature, thereby reducing the risk of scalding accidents; it also reduces hot water consumption from a supply that is maintained at a higher temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Thermostatic mixing valve|journal=Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning Engineering|date=26 October 2011|volume=83|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main categories for water temperature controlling devices: Heat Source, Group Control, and Point-of-Use.  

;Heat Source
These are used with [[central heating]] systems that use water as a medium.
* Tempering valves for use on hot water heat distribution systems
* High flow rates suitable for use in under floor (radiant) heating applications 
* Allows water to be stored at a higher temperature

;Group Control
These provide a uniform distribution temperature for all hot water outlets in a household.
* Designed for multi-point applications
* High flow rates (from 14 gpm to 51 gpm at 45 psi)
* Temperature stability

;Point-of-Use
These are single Outlet Thermostatic Mixing Valves, often called "thermostatic faucets", "thermostat [[Tap (valve)|taps]]" or "thermostat valves".
* Designed for single point applications, such as individual showering, hand wash basin mixers, bath or tub fillers
* High level protection against scalding and thermal shock

Although other temperature regulating valves exist, thermostatic mixing valves are the preferred type in health care facilities, as they limit maximum outlet temperature, regardless of pressure or flow.

&lt;!-- please do not put in modern equivalents their boiling points were different depending on the pressure--&gt;
&lt;!-- Some used the melting point of ice, some the freezing point of water (which is harder to determine well)--&gt;
* 1701 — [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] publishes a [[Newton's law of cooling|method]] of determining the rate of heat loss of a body and introduces a [[Newton scale|scale]], which had 0 degrees represent the freezing point of water, and 12 degrees for human body temperature.

* 1709 — [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] constructed alcohol thermometers which were reproducible (i.e. two would give the same temperature)
* 1714 — [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] invents the [[mercury (element)|mercury]]-in-glass [[thermometer]] giving much greater precision (4 x that of Rømer).

A '''turbine''' (from the [[Latin]] ''turbo'', a [[vortex]], related to the Greek {{lang|grc|τύρβη}}, ''tyrbē'', meaning "[[turbulence]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=turbine|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=turbine&amp;searchmode=none}}{{cite web|title=turbid|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=turbid&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|tu/rbh|τύρβη|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a rotary mechanical device that extracts [[energy]] from a [[fluid]] flow and converts it into useful [[Work (physics)|work]]. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a [[electric generator|generator]].&lt;ref name = "Munson"&gt;Munson, Bruce Roy, T. H. Okiishi, and Wade W. Huebsch. "Turbomachines." Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics. 6th ed. Hoboken, NJ: J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A turbine is a [[turbomachinery|turbomachine]] with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with [[Turbine blade|blades]] attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are [[windmill]]s and [[waterwheel]]s.

[[Gas turbine|Gas]], [[steam turbine|steam]], and [[water turbine|water]] turbines have a casing around the blades that contains and controls the working fluid. Credit for invention of the steam turbine is given both to Anglo-Irish engineer [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Sir Charles Parsons]] (1854–1931) for invention of the reaction turbine, and to Swedish engineer [[Gustaf de Laval]] (1845–1913) for invention of the impulse turbine. Modern steam turbines frequently employ both reaction and impulse in the same unit, typically varying the [[degree of reaction]] and impulse from the blade root to its periphery.

The word "turbine" was coined in 1822 by the French mining engineer [[Claude Burdin]] from the [[Latin]] ''turbo'', or [[vortex]], in a memo, "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse", which he submitted to the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie royale des sciences]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;In 1822, Claude Burdin submitted his memo "Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse" (Hydraulic turbines or high-speed rotary machines) to the Académie royale des sciences in Paris.  (See:  ''Annales de chimie et de physique'', vol. 21, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rzNCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA183#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 183] (1822).)  However, it was not until 1824 that a committee of the Académie (composed of Prony, Dupin, and Girard) reported favorably on Burdin's memo.  See: Prony and Girard (1824) [https://books.google.com/books?id=03BRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA207#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Rapport sur le mémoire de M. Burdin intitulé: Des turbines hydrauliques ou machines rotatoires à grande vitesse"] (Report on the memo of Mr. Burdin titled:  Hydraulic turbines or high-speed rotary machines), ''Annales de chimie et de physique'', vol. 26, pages 207-217.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benoit Fourneyron]], a former student of Claude Burdin, built the first practical water turbine.

[[File:Turbines impulse v reaction.png|thumb|right|350px|Schematic of impulse and reaction turbines, where the rotor is the rotating part, and the [[stator]] is the stationary part of the machine.]]
A working fluid contains [[potential energy]] (pressure [[head (hydraulic)|head]]) and [[kinetic energy]] (velocity head). The fluid may be [[compressibility|compressible]] or [[incompressible fluid|incompressible]]. Several physical principles are employed by turbines to collect this energy:

[[Impulse (physics)|Impulse]] turbines change the direction of flow of a high velocity fluid or gas jet. The resulting impulse spins the turbine and leaves the fluid flow with diminished kinetic energy. There is no pressure change of the fluid or gas in the [[turbine blade]]s (the moving blades), as in the case of a steam or gas turbine, all the pressure drop takes place in the stationary blades (the nozzles). Before reaching the turbine, the fluid's ''pressure head'' is changed to ''velocity head'' by accelerating the fluid with a [[nozzle]].  [[Pelton wheel]]s and [[Steam turbine|de Laval turbine]]s use this process exclusively. Impulse turbines do not require a pressure casement around the rotor since the fluid jet is created by the nozzle prior to reaching the blades on the rotor. [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law]] describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines.  Impulse turbines are most efficient for use in cases where the flow is low and the inlet pressure is high. &lt;ref name = "Munson"/&gt;

[[Reaction (physics)|Reaction]] turbines develop [[torque]] by reacting to the gas or fluid's pressure or mass.  The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades.&lt;ref name = "Munson"/&gt; A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the [[draft tube]]. [[Francis turbine]]s and most [[steam turbine]]s use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law]] describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines.  Reaction turbines are better suited to higher flow velocities or applications where the fluid head (upstream pressure) is low. &lt;ref name = "Munson"/&gt;

In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons-type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval-type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion.

In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. [[Wind turbine]]s use an [[airfoil]] to generate a reaction [[Lift (force)|lift]] from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may use either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in pressure.  Under these conditions, blading becomes strictly a reaction type design with the base of the blade solely impulse.  The reason is due to the effect of the rotation speed for each blade.  As the volume increases, the blade height increases, and the base of the blade spins at a slower speed relative to the tip.  This change in speed forces a designer to change from impulse at the base, to a high reaction-style tip.

Classical turbine design methods were developed in the mid 19th century.  Vector analysis related the fluid flow with turbine shape and rotation. Graphical calculation methods were used at first. Formulae for the basic dimensions of turbine parts are well documented and a highly efficient machine can be reliably designed for any fluid [[flow conditioning|flow condition]]. Some of the calculations are empirical or 'rule of thumb' formulae, and others are based on [[classical mechanics]].  As with most engineering calculations, simplifying assumptions were made.

[[File:Turbine inlet guide vanes of Atar turbojet.jpg|thumb|Turbine inlet guide vanes of a turbojet]]

[[Velocity triangle]]s can be used to calculate the basic performance of a turbine stage. Gas exits the stationary turbine nozzle guide vanes at absolute velocity ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a1&lt;/sub&gt;. The rotor rotates at velocity ''U''. Relative to the rotor, the velocity of the gas as it impinges on the rotor entrance is ''V''&lt;sub&gt;r1&lt;/sub&gt;. The gas is turned by the rotor and exits, relative to the rotor, at velocity ''V''&lt;sub&gt;r2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, in absolute terms the rotor exit velocity is ''V''&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt;. The velocity triangles are constructed using these various velocity vectors. Velocity triangles can be constructed at any section through the blading (for example: hub, tip, midsection and so on) but are usually shown at the mean stage radius. Mean performance for the stage can be calculated from the velocity triangles, at this radius, using the Euler equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta h = u\cdot\Delta v_w&lt;/math&gt;

Hence:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta h}{T} = \frac{u\cdot\Delta v_w}{T}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta h&lt;/math&gt; is the specific enthalpy drop across stage
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the turbine entry total (or stagnation) temperature
:&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the turbine rotor peripheral velocity
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v_w&lt;/math&gt; is the change in whirl velocity

The turbine pressure ratio is a function of &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta h}{T}&lt;/math&gt; and the turbine efficiency.

Modern turbine design carries the calculations further.  [[Computational fluid dynamics]] dispenses with many of the simplifying assumptions used to derive classical formulas and computer software facilitates optimization. These tools have led to steady improvements in turbine design over the last forty years.

The primary numerical classification of a turbine is its [[specific speed]].  This number describes the speed of the turbine at its maximum efficiency with respect to the power and flow rate.  The specific speed is derived to be independent of turbine size. Given the fluid flow conditions and the desired shaft output speed, the specific speed can be calculated and an appropriate turbine design selected.

The specific speed, along with some fundamental formulas can be used to reliably scale an existing design of known performance to a new size with corresponding performance.

Off-design performance is normally displayed as a [[turbine map]] or characteristic.

== Types ==
* [[Steam turbine]]s are used for the generation of electricity in thermal power plants, such as plants using [[coal]], [[fuel oil]] or [[nuclear fuel]].  They were once used to directly drive mechanical devices such as ships' [[propeller]]s (for example the ''[[Turbinia]]'', the first turbine-powered [[steam launch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turbinia|url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5652.pdf|work=(ASME-sponsored booklet to mark the designation of Turbinia as an international engineering landmark)|publisher=Tyne And Wear County Council Museums|accessdate=13 April 2011|author=Adrian Osler|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xujimKGb?url=http://files.asme.org/ASMEORG/Communities/History/Landmarks/5652.pdf|archivedate=13 April 2011|date=October 1981|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) but most such applications now use reduction gears or an intermediate electrical step, where the turbine is used to generate electricity, which then powers an [[electric motor]] connected to the mechanical load. Turbo electric ship machinery was particularly popular in the period immediately before and during [[World War II]], primarily due to a lack of sufficient gear-cutting facilities in US and UK shipyards.
* [[Gas turbine]]s are sometimes referred to as turbine engines. Such engines usually feature an inlet, fan, compressor, combustor and nozzle (possibly other assemblies) in addition to one or more turbines.
* [[Transonic]] turbine. The gas flow in most turbines employed in gas turbine engines remains subsonic throughout the expansion process. In a transonic turbine the gas flow becomes supersonic as it exits the nozzle guide vanes, although the downstream velocities normally become subsonic. Transonic turbines operate at a higher pressure ratio than normal but are usually less efficient and uncommon.
* [[Contra-rotating]] turbines. With [[axial turbine]]s, some efficiency advantage can be obtained if a downstream turbine rotates in the opposite direction to an upstream unit. However, the complication can be counter-productive. A contra-rotating steam turbine, usually known as the Ljungström turbine, was originally invented by Swedish Engineer [[Fredrik Ljungström]] (1875–1964) in Stockholm, and in partnership with his brother Birger Ljungström he obtained a patent in 1894. The design is essentially a multi-stage [[radial turbine]] (or pair of 'nested' turbine rotors) offering great efficiency, four times as large heat drop per stage as in the reaction (Parsons) turbine, extremely compact design and the type met particular success in back pressure power plants. However, contrary to other designs, large steam volumes are handled with difficulty and only a combination with axial flow turbines (DUREX) admits the turbine to be built for power greater than ca 50 MW. In marine applications only about 50 turbo-electric units were ordered (of which a considerable amount were finally sold to land plants) during 1917-19, and during 1920-22 a few turbo-mechanic not very successful units were sold.&lt;ref&gt;Ingvar Jung, 1979, The history of the marine turbine, part 1, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, dep of History of technology&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few turbo-electric marine plants were still in use in the late 1960s (ss Ragne, ss Regin) while most land plants remain in use 2010.
* [[Stator]]less turbine. Multi-stage turbines have a set of static (meaning stationary) inlet guide vanes that direct the gas flow onto the rotating rotor blades. In a stator-less turbine the gas flow exiting an upstream rotor impinges onto a downstream rotor without an intermediate set of stator vanes (that rearrange the pressure/velocity energy levels of the flow) being encountered.
* [[Ceramic]] turbine. Conventional high-pressure turbine blades (and vanes) are made from nickel based alloys and often use intricate internal air-cooling passages to prevent the metal from overheating. In recent years, experimental ceramic blades have been manufactured and tested in gas turbines, with a view to increasing rotor inlet temperatures and/or, possibly, eliminating air cooling. Ceramic blades are more brittle than their metallic counterparts, and carry a greater risk of catastrophic blade failure. This has tended to limit their use in jet engines and gas turbines to the stator (stationary) blades.
* [[Ducted fan|Shrouded]] turbine. Many turbine rotor blades have shrouding at the top, which interlocks with that of adjacent blades, to increase damping and thereby reduce blade flutter. In large land-based electricity generation steam turbines, the shrouding is often complemented, especially in the long blades of a low-pressure turbine, with lacing wires. These wires pass through holes drilled in the blades at suitable distances from the blade root and are usually brazed to the blades at the point where they pass through. Lacing wires reduce blade flutter in the central part of the blades. The introduction of lacing wires substantially reduces the instances of blade failure in large or low-pressure turbines.
* [[Ducted fan|Shroudless turbine]]. Modern practice is, wherever possible, to eliminate the rotor shrouding, thus reducing the [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] load on the blade and the cooling requirements.
* [[Tesla turbine|Bladeless turbine]] uses the boundary layer effect and not a fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.
* [[Water turbine]]s
** [[Pelton wheel|Pelton turbine]], a type of impulse water turbine.
** [[Francis turbine]], a type of widely used water turbine.
** [[Kaplan turbine]], a variation of the Francis Turbine.
** [[Turgo turbine]], a modified form of the Pelton wheel.
** [[Cross-flow turbine]], also known as Banki-Michell turbine, or Ossberger turbine.
* [[Wind turbine]]. These normally operate as a single stage without nozzle and interstage guide vanes. An exception is the [[Éolienne Bollée]], which has a stator and a rotor.
* Velocity compound "Curtis".  Curtis combined the de Laval and Parsons turbine by using a set of fixed nozzles on the first stage or stator and then a rank of fixed and rotating blade rows, as in the Parsons or de Laval, typically up to ten compared with up to a hundred stages of a Parsons design.  The overall efficiency of a Curtis design is less than that of either the Parsons or de Laval designs, but it can be satisfactorily operated through a much wider range of speeds, including successful operation at low speeds and at lower pressures, which made it ideal for use in ships' powerplant. In a Curtis arrangement, the entire heat drop in the steam takes place in the initial nozzle row and both the subsequent moving blade rows and stationary blade rows merely change the direction of the steam. Use of a small section of a Curtis arrangement, typically one nozzle section and two or three rows of moving blades, is usually termed a Curtis 'Wheel' and in this form, the Curtis found widespread use at sea as a 'governing stage' on many reaction and impulse turbines and turbine sets. This practice is still commonplace today in marine steam plant.
* [[Pressure compounding in turbines|Pressure compound]] multi-stage impulse, or "Rateau", after its French inventor, [[:fr:Auguste Rateau|Auguste Rateau]].  The Rateau employs simple impulse rotors separated by a nozzle diaphragm. The diaphragm is essentially a partition wall in the turbine with a series of tunnels cut into it, funnel shaped with the broad end facing the previous stage and the narrow the next they are also angled to direct the steam jets onto the impulse rotor.
*[[Mercury vapour turbine]]s used [[mercury (element)|mercury]] as the working fluid, to improve the efficiency of fossil-fuelled generating stations. Although a few power plants were built with combined mercury vapour and conventional steam turbines, the toxicity of the metal mercury was quickly apparent.
*[[Screw turbine]] is a [[water turbine]] which uses the principle of the [[Archimedean screw]] to convert the [[potential energy]] of water on an upstream level into [[kinetic energy]].

== Uses ==
{{One source|section|date=May 2018}}
Almost all [[electrical power]] on Earth is generated with a turbine of some type. Very high efficiency steam turbines harness around 40% of the thermal energy, with the rest exhausted as [[waste heat]].

Most [[jet engine]]s rely on turbines to supply mechanical work from their working fluid and fuel as do all nuclear ships and power plants.

Turbines are often part of a larger machine.  A [[gas turbine]], for example, may refer to an internal combustion machine that contains a turbine, ducts, compressor, combustor, heat-exchanger, fan and (in the case of one designed to produce electricity) an alternator. Combustion turbines and steam turbines may be connected to machinery such as pumps and compressors, or may be used for propulsion of ships, usually through an intermediate gearbox to reduce rotary speed.

Reciprocating piston engines such as [[aircraft engine]]s can use a turbine powered by their exhaust to drive an intake-air compressor, a configuration known as a [[turbocharger]] (turbine [[supercharger]]) or, colloquially, a "turbo".

Turbines can have very high power density (i.e. the ratio of power to weight, or power to volume). This is because of their ability to operate at very high speeds. The [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s used [[turbopump]]s (machines consisting of a pump driven by a turbine engine) to feed the propellants (liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen) into the engine's combustion chamber.  The liquid hydrogen turbopump is slightly larger than an automobile engine (weighing approximately 700&amp;nbsp;lb) and produces nearly 70,000 [[horsepower|hp]] (52.2 [[megawatt|MW]]).

[[Turboexpander]]s are widely used as sources of refrigeration in industrial processes.

Military jet engines, as a branch of gas turbines, have recently been used as primary flight controller in post-stall flight using jet deflections that are also called thrust vectoring.&lt;ref&gt;"Multiaxis Thrust Vectoring Flight Control Vs Catastrophic Failure Prevention," Reports to U.S. Dept. of Transportation/FAA, Technical Center, ACD-210, FAA X88/0/6FA/921000/4104/T1706D, FAA Res.

'''VREAM, Inc.''' was a US technology company that functioned between 1991 and 1996.  It was one of the first companies{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} to develop PC-based software for authoring and viewing [[virtual reality|virtual reality (VR)]] environments.

==Company history==

The company was founded in Chicago in 1991 by former [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] consultant Edward R. LaHood, who derived the name VREAM from the phrase "virtual reality dream." LaHood was joined by co-founders Ken Gaebler.&lt;ref name="Ken Gaebler: Executive Profile and Biography"&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=431586&amp;privcapId=225172379 "Ken Gaebler: Executive Profile and Biography"], [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dan Malven&lt;ref name="The May Report: August 6, 1999"&gt;[http://themayreport.com/1999/08/06/more-internet-cos-sds-sold-40mm-orbit-vp-marketing/ "The May Report: August 6, 1999"], [[Ron May (columnist)]]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993.

In 1991, LaHood created VREAMScript,&lt;ref name="StampeRoehl1993-Page97"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dave Stampe|author2=Bernie Roehl|author3=John Eagan|title=Virtual Reality Creations: Explore, Manipulate, and Create Virtual Worlds on Your PC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSAIAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Waite Group Press|isbn=978-1-878739-39-1|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; a scripting language for virtual reality environments that allowed for the definition of complex 3D objects, environment attributes, object attributes, and triggers for cause-and-effect relationships. The company then created a PC-based authoring tool, the VREAM Virtual Reality Development System,&lt;ref name="Staff1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=IGIC, Inc. Staff|title=Emerging Markets for Virtual Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEK5Yy2BiY4C&amp;pg=PT372|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Information Gatekeepers Inc|pages=177–178|id=GGKEY:NHD2JD3Y9FK}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build virtual reality environments and an accompanying runtime player, the VREAM Runtime System, that allowed end users to experience the virtual environments, moving through them in real-time while interacting with the rendered, virtual objects.

The VREAM Virtual Reality System, which included the VREAM Virtual Reality Development System and the VREAM Runtime System, was released for purchase in December, 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Strattner |first=Anthony |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13215758.html |title=VREAM bringing virtual reality to a PC near you. |work=Computer Shopper |date=1991-12-01 |accessdate=2014-11-30 |subscription= yes |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a $1,495 price point and with support for a wide range of immersive devices, including the [[Mattel Power Glove|Power Glove]].&lt;ref name="StampeRoehl1993-Page85"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dave Stampe|author2=Bernie Roehl|author3=John Eagan|title=Virtual Reality Creations: Explore, Manipulate, and Create Virtual Worlds on Your PC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSAIAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Waite Group Press|isbn=978-1-878739-39-1|page=85|quote=Added to VREAM in version .0806 is support for a PowerGlove connected to a parallel port}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial Impact==

Prior to 1992, rendering real-time [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] had only been possible on high-end [[workstation]]s, and creating a real-time 3D graphics simulation required strong programming skills. The growing power of PCs, driven by such innovations as the [[Pentium]] chip (introduced by [[Intel]] in March 1993), made bringing virtual reality simulations to the PC a possibility, and LaHood's strong programming skills allowed him to be first to market with a PC-based virtual reality authoring solution that could be used by non-programmers. (LaHood was not, however, the first to bring virtual reality to the PC; that credit goes to Sense8 founders Patrice Gelband and Eric Gullichsen who, earlier in 1992, introduced WorldToolKit, a VR programmer's library that allowed developers to build "virtual world" applications that ran on desktop computers.&lt;ref name="WORLDTOOLKIT Version 1.01 Program Description"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/computer-science/virtual-reality/virtual-worlds/faq/commercial/Sense8 "WORLDTOOLKIT Version 1.01 Program Description"], [[ibiblio]]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Due to its accessibility to non-programmers and those who could not afford high-end workstations, VREAM's software quickly became popular in the hobbyist virtual reality community.&lt;ref name="Wodaski1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Wodaski|title=Virtual reality madness 1996|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcvyDPYOIIoC|date=September 1995|publisher=Sams|isbn=978-0-672-30865-9|page=178|quote=VREAM is one of the products with many, many good features that are not obvious at first glance. Let me state the value of VREAM up front: it's the most powerful virtual reality software product for the price.

House|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; game development, engineering prototyping, data visualization and other simulations. The software was even used in the treatment of fear of public speaking,&lt;ref name="Riva1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giuseppe Riva|title=Virtual Reality in Neuro-psycho-physiology: Cognitive, Clinical and Methodological Issues in Assessment and Rehabilitation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3dT_29znBoC&amp;pg=PA62|date=1 January 1997|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-90-5199-364-6|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; acrophobia &lt;ref name="Overcoming Phobias By Virtual Exposure"&gt;[http://www.do2learn.com/aboutus/research/phobia.htm "Communications of the ACM 40, 8 (Aug. 1997), 34-39, Overcoming Phobias By Virtual Exposure"].

Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its software offerings, the company also provided virtual reality development services. A notable services client was [[Burger King]], which hired VREAM to build a "restaurant of the future" for its franchisee conference.&lt;ref name="PC Mag March 1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ziff Davis, Inc.|title=PC Mag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79i1lfAqumUC&amp;pg=PA172|date=14 March 1995|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|pages=170–198|issn=0888-8507}}&lt;/ref&gt; VREAM also created virtual reality product demonstrations for [[Bombardier Recreational Products]] for their [[Sea-Doo]] and [[Ski-Doo]] lines.&lt;ref name="Enterprise1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=IDG Enterprise|title=Computerworld|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oRQwHPsoWQ4C&amp;pg=PT44|date=7 July 1997|publisher=IDG Enterprise|page=45|issn=0010-4841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Web-Based VR==

In 1994, based on the emergence of the World Wide Web and at the suggestion of co-founder Malven, the company recast its runtime player as a plug-in for Netscape Navigator, dubbing it WIRL. VREAM would later release WIRL as an ActiveX control for Microsoft Internet Explorer.&lt;ref name="WirlActiveX"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/VREAM,+Inc.+announces+WIRL+Virtual+Reality+Browser+for+Microsoft...-a018544074 "VREAM, Inc. announces WIRL Virtual Reality Browser for Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0"]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a time when web-based software was in its earliest stages, WIRL was quite popular, ranking fourth on the list of downloaded software, surpassed only by Netscape Navigator, MPEG Player NET TOOB and HTML editor HotDog Pro.&lt;ref name="Winsock"&gt;[http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/4.05/top_ten.html "Wired Magazine, Issue 4.05, May 1996: Most popular Winsock applications"]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first month of being available, WIRL was downloaded over 30,000 times, providing VREAM with a very efficient way to promote its software.&lt;ref name="DownesMui2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Larry Downes|author2=Chunka Mui|title=Unleashing the Killer App: Digital Strategies for Market Dominance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_5hjCP1drwC&amp;pg=PR23|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Business Press|isbn=978-1-57851-261-4|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WIRL was also used by PC Magazine to test the capabilities of PC graphics cards.&lt;ref name="PCMagDec1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ziff Davis, Inc.|title=PC Mag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m4OknWEkpB4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA286|date=3 December 1996|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|page=286|issn=0888-8507}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft, and Craig Barrett, of Intel, used WIRL demonstrations in their keynote speeches to showcase the potential of more powerful PCs.&lt;ref name="Evolution"&gt;[http://www.gaebler.com/Gaebler_Entrepreneurial_Evolution_2.htm "Ken Gaebler, Entrepreneurial Evolution"]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1994, [[VRML]], a standard file format for representing Web-based, real-time interactive 3D environments, was introduced. The introduction of VRML, backed by [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] and other companies, lessened the future potential of VREAM's proprietary VREAMScript language. To mitigate its risks, VREAM adopted the approach of supporting both VRML and VREAMScript in its software products.

In May 1995, VREAM rebranded the next generation of its VR authoring software as VRCreator, and touted its support for "multi-participant VR...across the World Wide Web."&lt;ref name="VRCreatorRelease"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Powerful+Virtual+Reality+Software+Now+Available+--+VREAM+Ships...-a016941361 "Powerful Virtual Reality Software Now Available -- VREAM Ships VRCreator Beta Systems"]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venture Capital Funding==

In November 1995, based on the company's track record and based on growing interest in the venture capital community for Web-focused software companies, VREAM received $750,000 in venture funding from PLATINUM Venture Partners.&lt;ref name="PLATINUM Invests"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PLATINUM+technology+and+Platinum+Venture+Partners+invest+in+VREAM%3B...-a018011132 "PLATINUM technology and Platinum Venture Partners invest in VREAM"]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, co-founder Malven left to pursue other opportunities.

==Competition==

VREAM's primary competitor in its earliest days was Sense8 Corp. of Sausalito, Calif.,&lt;ref name="TribVRStory"&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-14/business/9303191904_1_vr-jordan-weisman-real-world/2 "Chicago Tribune: Virtual Reality Enters Office Landscape"]. Retrieved 2014-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt; which offered a virtual reality programming toolkit for the PC.

By March 1995, however, the VR space was getting crowded, with many authoring tools on the market, including VREAM's VRCreator, Virtus VR, Virtus Walkthrough Pro, and Superscape VRT.&lt;ref name="PC Mag March 1995" /&gt;

As virtual reality grabbed market attention, a number of new competitors emerged, including Paper Software (founded by [[Mike McCue]]), Intervista (founded by [[Tony Parisi (software developer)|Tony Parisi]]) and [[Silicon Graphics]].

==Company Sale==

After Netscape acquired Paper Software in February 1996 for $20 million,&lt;ref name="Stanford University's Entrepreneurship Corner: Mike McCue"&gt;[http://ecorner.stanford.edu/author/mike_mccue "Stanford University's Entrepreneurship Corner: Mike McCue"], [[Stanford University]], April 20, 2006. Retrieved 2011-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt; VREAM hired an investment banker to sell the company.

While working to sell the company, VREAM continued to work on the next generation of its VRML authoring and browsing software. After releasing a new version, the company's VRML browser, WIRL, received the PC Magazine Editor's Choice award in November 1996.&lt;ref name="PCMagNov1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ziff Davis, Inc.|title=PC Mag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PQnEyUwwXt8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA263|date=5 November 1996|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|pages=260–263|issn=0888-8507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that same month, November 1996, VREAM was acquired by [[Platinum Technology|PLATINUM Technology, Inc.]] for $10.3 million&lt;ref name="PLATINUM Acquisition"&gt;[http://ipoalerts.edgar-online.com/EFX_dll/EDGARpro.dll?FetchFilingHTML1?ID=in_535257&amp;SessionID=VDdY6m_fwz3nF6V "PLATINUM TECHNOLOGY, INC.

'''Wall padding''' may go by a variety of names, including; Softwall, Wainscott, Cushion Wall, Safety Padding, and more.

== Purpose ==
The primary purpose of wall padding is to provide a safe level of absorption for an individual making impact with an established object.  Often these objects are walls (hence “wall padding”), but also these pads commonly protect [[bleacher]]s, stage fronts, [[I-Beam]]s, [[goal post]]s, columns, and fences.

== Standard Sizes ==
Typical indoor wall panels are 24” wide x 72” high.  In recent history however many newly constructed [[school]]s and [[University|universities]] have made a push for 84” high padding in their [[basketball]] facilities, where athletes are often elevated in motion.  In [[grappling]] and [[wrestling]] facilities pads are regularly 60” since most movement occurs on the ground.

[[Outdoor stadium]] padding is 48” wide x 96” high. However, when working with a skilled [[manufacturer]] all dimensions can often be easily customized to fit the unique needs of your facility.

== Composition ==
Standard quality indoor wall panel will begin with a 7/16” osb (oriented [[strand board]]) backer.  To that, a layer of [[foam]] will be laminated.  For indoor panels the standard thickness of foam is 2”, but which type 2” foam is laminated to the backer is the most important part of the pad (see foam).  After these steps have been completed a 16 oz. [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] cover is stapled over the face and onto the back of the pad.

A basic stadium pad, will spend most of its life outdoors, and should always begin with a ½” to ¾” weather durable backer board.  Most often [[plywood]] is used, but other experienced companies like [[Mancino Manufacturing]] use a higher grade backer called [[extira]]. To that, a layer of foam will be laminated.  For outdoor stadium panels the standard thickness of foam is 3”.  Foam should be a minimum 1.8 pound density, with a 50-pound IFD. After these steps a 16o oz. to 17 oz. fabric will be stapled over the face of the pad.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mancinoinc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foam ==
Foam used in manufacturing wall padding is typically a [[polyurethane]] based foam, but can vary based on a specification written, or simply customer preference.

== Vinyl ==
Vinyl range from 14 oz. to 18 oz. in weight, and typically has a light [[leather]] emboss pattern engrained into the good side of the material.  There are at least 16 standard colors to choose from. Vinyl should also be expected to meet [[fire retardant]] test NFPA-701 and ASTM E84 [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E84.htm]

== Installation Methods ==
The most common installation methods are; standard method, [[nailing margin]], and [[z-clip]].

Standard method is a process in which panels are toe nailed in with a finishing nailer.  Most often this method is done by professionals.  If the surface the pads are being installed on is capable of being nailed into, pads will often be mounted directly to that surface. However, if the surface is unable to be nailed into, like [[cinder block]], then [[firing strip]] will be mounted first, and the pads mounted to them.

Nailing margin is a process in which the manufacturer will intentionally leave 1” of foam off the top and bottom of the panel.  This 1” area is meant to allow the installer to drill directly through the panel, without damaging, or compromising the pad.  If the surface the pads are being installed on is capable of being screwed into, pads will often be mounted directly to that surface. However, if the surface is unable to be drilled into, like cinder block, then firing strip will be mounted first, and the pads mounted to them.

[[Z-clip]] is a process in which the panels are hung with male/female [[aluminum]] channeling.  An installer will first mount the female side of the aluminum clip to the wall (typically in 6’ lengths).  The installer will then mount the male side of the clip to the panel (typically 22” lengths).  To hang the panels, the installer will drop the panel with the male clip into the female clip on the wall. These pads will appear the same as standard method pads on from head on, but can also be removed from the wall because of the [[male/female clip]].

== Upgrades ==
Graphics art work is common upgrade that can be made to most any pad, in the manufacturing process.

'''Well drilling''' is the process of drilling a hole in the ground for the extraction of a natural resource such as [[ground water]], [[brine]], [[natural gas]], or [[petroleum]], for the injection of a fluid from surface to a subsurface reservoir or for subsurface formations evaluation or monitoring. Drilling for the exploration of the nature of the material underground (for instance in search of metallic [[ore]]) is best described as ''[[borehole]]'' drilling.
[[File:Vertical Drill Bit.JPG|thumb|Vertical Drill Bit]]
The earliest wells were water wells, shallow pits dug by hand in regions where the [[water table]] approached the surface, usually with [[masonry]] or wooden walls lining the interior to prevent collapse. Modern drilling techniques utilize long drill shafts, producing holes much narrower and deeper than could be produced by digging.

Well drilling can be done either manually or mechanically and the nature of required equipment varies from extremely simple and cheap to very sophisticated.

'''Managed Pressure Drilling''' (MPD) is defined by the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) as “an adaptive [[drilling]] process used to more precisely control the annular pressure profile throughout the wellbore." The objectives of MPD are “to ascertain the downhole pressure environment limits and to manage the annular hydraulic pressure profile accordingly."

==History==
The earliest record of well drilling dates from 347 AD in China.&lt;ref name="Vogt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristiina A.

In the modern era, the first roller cone [[patent]] was for the rotary rock bit and was issued to American businessman and inventor [[Howard Hughes Sr.]] in 1909. It consisted of two interlocking cones. American businessman [[Walter Benona Sharp]] worked very closely with Hughes in developing the rock bit. The success of this bit led to the founding of the [[Sharp-Hughes Tool Company]]. In 1933 two Hughes engineers, one of whom was Ralph Neuhaus, invented the tricone bit, which has three cones.  The Hughes patent for the tricone bit lasted until 1951, after which other companies made similar bits. However, Hughes still held 40% of the world's drill bit market in 2000. The superior wear performance of PDC bits gradually eroded the dominance of roller cone bits and early in this century PDC drill bit revenues overtook those of roller cone bits. The technology of both bit types has advanced significantly to provide improved durability and rate of penetration of the rock. This has been driven by the economics of the industry, and by the change from the empirical approach of Hughes in the 1930s, to modern day domain Finite Element codes for both the hydraulic and cutter placement software.

==Drill bits in mechanical drilling==

The factors effecting drill bit selection include the type of geology and the capabilities of the rig. Due to the high number of wells that have been drilled, information from an adjacent well is most often used to make the appropriate selection. Two different types of drill bits exist: fixed cutter and roller cone. A fixed cutter bit is one where there are no moving parts, but drilling occurs due to shearing, scraping or abrasion of the rock. Fixed cutter bits can be either polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) or grit hotpressed inserts (GHI) or natural diamond.  Roller cone bits can be either tungsten carbide inserts (TCI) for harder formations or milled tooth (MT) for softer rock. The manufacturing process and composites used in each type of drill bit make them ideal for specific drilling situations. Additional enhancements can be made to any bit to increase the effectiveness for almost any drilling situation.

A major factor in drill bit selection is the type of formation to be drilled. The effectiveness of a drill bit varies by formation type. There are three types of formations: soft, medium and hard. A soft formation includes unconsolidated [[sand]]s, [[clay]]s, soft [[limestone]]s, red beds and [[shale]]. Medium formations include [[calcite]]s, [[dolomite]]s, limestones, and hard shale. Hard formations include hard shale, calcites, mudstones, cherty lime stones and hard and abrasive formations.

Until 2006, market share was divided primarily among [[Hughes Christensen]], [http://www.halliburton.com/ps/default.aspx?navid=1368&amp;pageid=57&amp;prodgrpid=MSE%3a%3a1045760741741661/ Security-DBS] (now Halliburton Drill Bits and Services), [http://www.slb.com/services/drilling/drill_bits.aspx Smith Bits] (a subsidiary of Schlumberger), and [http://www.reedhycalog.com/ REEDHycalog] (acquired by NOV in 2008).

By 2014, [http://ulterra.com/ Ulterra] (now a subsidiary of ESCO Corp.) and [https://www.linkedin.com/company/varel-international Varel International] (now a subsidiary of Swedish engineering group Sandvik) had together gained nearly 30% of the U.S. bit market and eroded the historical dominance of the Smith, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes.

A '''well kill''' is the operation of placing a column of heavy fluid into a [[Oil well|well bore]] in order to prevent the flow of [[Oil reservoir|reservoir]] fluids without the need for pressure control equipment at the surface. It works on the principle that the hydrostatic head of the "kill fluid" or "kill mud" will be enough to suppress the [[pressure]] of the formation fluids. Well kills may be planned in the case of advanced [[Well intervention|interventions]] such as [[workover]]s, or be contingency operations. The situation calling for a well kill will dictate the method taken.

Not all well kills are deliberate.  Sometimes, the unintended buildup of fluids, either from injection of chemicals like [[methanol]] from surface, or from liquids produced from the reservoir, can be enough to kill the well, particularly [[Natural gas|gas]] wells, which are notoriously easy to kill.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Well control in general is an extremely expensive and dangerous operation. Extensive training, testing, proof of competence, and experience are prerequisites for planning and performing a well kill, even a seemingly simple one. Many people have died through incorrectly performed well kills.

==Principles==
The principle of a well kill revolves around the weight of a column of fluid and hence the pressure exerted at the bottom.

&lt;math&gt;P=hg\rho&lt;/math&gt;

Where P is the pressure at depth h in the column, g is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration of gravity]] and ρ is the [[density]] of the fluid.  It is common in the [[oil industry]] to use [[Specific weight|weight density]], which is the product of mass density and the acceleration of gravity.  This reduces the equation to:

&lt;math&gt;P=h\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Where γ is the weight density.  Weight density may also be described as the pressure gradient because it directly determines how much extra pressure will be added by increasing depth of the column of fluid.

The objective in a well kill, is to make the pressure at the bottom of the kill fluid equal (or slightly greater) than the pressure of the reservoir fluids.

===Example===
The pressure of the reservoir fluids at the bottom of the hole is 38[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]].  We have a kill fluid with a weight density of 16[[Newton (unit)|kN]].m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.  What will need to be the height of the hydrostatic head in order to kill the well?

From the equation:
&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{P}{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{38\,MPa}{16\,kNm^{-3}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;h=2375\,m&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, a column of 2375m of this fluid is needed. This refers to the true vertical depth of the column, not the measured depth, which is always larger than true vertical depth due to deviations from vertical.

===Math in the oil field===
In the [[oil industry]], a pure [[International System of Units|SI system]] is extremely rare.  Weight densities are commonly either given as [[specific gravity]] or in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] per [[gallon]].  Simple conversion factors (0.433 for specific gravity and 0.052 for ppg) convert these values to a pressure gradient in [[Pounds per square inch|psi]] per [[foot (length)|foot]].  Multiplying by the depth in feet gives the pressure at the bottom of the column.

Of course, when the well is being drilled in metres as the depth unit, the maths gets more complicated. Since well-kill certification is normally (in the US/ UK) done in "oil field units" (feet for length, inches for diameters, oilfield barrels for volume-pumped, psi for pressures), complex workarounds are often performed to keep the planned calculations in line with local regulations and industry "best practice".

==Methods of well kill==
During all well kills, careful attention must be paid to not exceeding the formation strength at the weakest point of the wellbore (or casing/ liner pipes, as appropriate), the "fracture pressure", otherwise fluid will be lost from the wellbore to the formation. Since this lost volume is unknown, it becomes very hard to tell how the kill is proceeding, especially if gas is involved with its large volume change through different parts of the wellbore. Combining a well kill with such a "lost circulation" situation is a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Petroleum Engineering Handbook, Volume II: Drilling Engineering|last=|first=|publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55563-114-7|location=|pages=Chapter-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lost circulation situations can, of course, also lead to well kill situations.

===Reverse circulation===
This is often the tidiest way of making a planned well kill.  It involves pumping kill fluid down the 'A' [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] of the well, through a point of communication between it and the [[production tubing]] just above the [[production packer]] and up the tubing, displacing the lighter well bore fluids, which are allowed to flow to production.

The point of communication was traditionally a device called a sliding sleeve, or sliding side door, which is a hydraulically operated device, built into the [[production tubing]].  During normal operation, it would remain closed sealing off the tubing and the annulus, but for events such as this, it would be opened to allow the free flow of fluids between the two regions.  These components have fallen out of favour as they were prone to leaking.  Instead, it is now more common to punch a hole in the tubing for circulation kills.  Although this permanently damages the tubing, given that most planned well kills are for [[workover]]s, this is not an issue, since the tubing is being pulled for replacement anyway.

===Bullheading===
This is the most common method of a contingency well kill.  If there is a sudden need to kill a well quickly, without the time for rigging up for circulation, the more blunt instrument of bullheading may be used.  This involves simply pumping the kill fluid directly down the well bore, forcing the well bore fluids back into the [[Oil reservoir|reservoir]].  This can be effective at achieving the central aim of a well kill; building up a sufficient hydrostatic head in the well bore.  However, it can be limited by the burst-pressure capabilities of the tubing or casing, and can risk damaging the reservoir by forcing undesired materials into it.  The principal advantage is that it can be done with little advanced planning.

===Forward circulation===
This is similar to reverse circulation, except the kill fluid is pumped into the [[production tubing]] and circulated out through the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]].  Though effective, it is not as desirable since it is preferred that the well bore fluids be displaced out to production, rather than the annulus.

===Lubricate and bleed===
This is the most time consuming form of well kill.  It involves repeatedly pumping in small quantities of kill mud into the well bore and then bleeding off excess pressure.  It works on the principle that the heavier kill mud will sink below the lighter well bore fluids and so bleeding off the pressure will remove the latter leaving an increasing quantity of kill mud in the well bore with successive steps.

===Well kills during drilling operations===
During drilling, pressure control is maintained through the use of precisely concocted [[drilling fluid]], which balances out the pressure at the bottom of the hole.  In the event of suddenly encountering a high pressure pocket, pressure due to drilling fluid may not be able to counter the high formation pressure. Allowing formation fluid to enter into the well-bore. This influx of formation fluid is called kick and then it becomes necessary to kill the well.  This is done by pumping kill mud down the [[Drill string|drill pipe]], where it circulates out the bottom and into the well bore.

==Reversing a well kill==
The intention of a well kill (or the reality of an unintentional well kill) is to stop reservoir fluids flowing to surface.  This of course creates problems when it is desirable to get the well flowing again.  In order to reverse the well kill, the kill fluid must be displaced from the well bore.  This involves injecting a gas at high pressure, usually [[nitrogen]] since it is inert and relatively cheap.  A gas can be put under sufficient pressure to allow it to push heavy kill fluid, but will then expand and become light once pressure is removed.  This means that having displaced the kill fluid, it will not itself kill the well. Low density ("light") liquids such as diesel fuel, or the "base fluid" for a "(synthetic) oil-based mud" can also be used, depending on availability and pressure-management issues for a specific well.  The reservoir fluids should be able to flow to surface, displacing the gas.

The cheapest way to do it is similar to bullheading, where the light fluid (nitrogen, or low density liquid) is pumped in under high pressure to force the kill fluid into the reservoir.  This, of course, runs a high risk of causing well damage.  The most effective way is to use [[coiled tubing]], pumping the gas/diesel down the coil and circulating out the bottom into the well bore, where it will displace the kill mud to production. (Of course, getting a coiled tubing spread to the location may take weeks of work and logistics.)

An '''X-ray generator''' is a device that produces [[X-rays]]. Together with an [[X-ray detector]], it is commonly used in a variety of applications including [[medicine]], [[fluorescence]], electronic assembly inspection, and measurement of material thickness in manufacturing operations. In medical applications, X-ray generators are used by [[radiographer]]s to acquire x-ray images of the internal structures (e.g., bones) of living organisms, and also in [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]].

[[File:Portable x-ray device.jpg|200px|thumb|'''''XR150''''' - Portable pulsed X-ray Battery Powered X-ray Generator used in Security.]]
{{See|X-ray tube}}
An X-ray generator generally contains an [[X-ray tube]] to produce the X-rays. Possibly, [[radioisotope]]s can also be used to generate X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=i_iDRTp75AsC&amp;pg=PA442 Page 442] in: {{cite book|title=Handbook of X-Ray Spectrometry, Second Edition, Practical Spectroscopy|author=Rene Van Grieken, A. Markowicz|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=9780203908709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An X-ray tube is a simple [[vacuum tube]] that contains a [[cathode]], which directs a stream of electrons into a vacuum, and an [[anode]], which collects the electrons and is made of tungsten to evacuate the heat generated by the collision. When the electrons collide with the target, about 1% of the resulting energy is emitted as [[X-ray]]s, with the remaining 99% released as heat. Due to the high energy of the electrons that reach relativistic speeds the target is usually made of [[tungsten]] even if other material can be used particularly in XRF applications.

An X-ray generator also needs to contain a cooling system to cool the anode; many X-ray generators use water or oil recirculating systems.&lt;ref name="ntd"&gt;[http://www.ndt-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/Radiography/EquipmentMaterials/xrayGenerators.htm "X-ray Generators"], NDT Resource Center.

===Medical imaging===
[[File:Projectional radiography components.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Acquisition of [[projectional radiography]], with an X-ray generator and a [[X-ray detector|detector]].]]
In medical imaging applications, an x-ray machine has a control console that is used by a radiologic technologist to select x-ray attributes suitable for the specific exam, a power supply that creates and produces the desired kVp (peak kilovoltage), mA (milliamperes, sometimes referred to as mAs which is actually mA multiplied by the desired exposure length) for the x-ray tube, and the x-ray tube itself.

==History==
The discovery of X-rays came from experimenting with [[Crookes tube]]s, an early experimental electrical discharge tube invented by English physicist [[William Crookes]] around 1869-1875. In 1895, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered X-rays emanating from Crookes tubes and the many uses for X-rays were immediately apparent. One of the first X-ray photographs was made of the hand of Röntgen's wife. The image displayed both her wedding ring and bones. On January 18, 1896 an ''X-ray machine'' was formally displayed by [[Henry Louis Smith]]. A fully functioning unit was introduced to the public at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition#Medical Contributions|1904 World's Fair]] by [[Clarence Madison Dally|Clarence Dally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/|title=Clarence Dally - The Man Who Gave Thomas Edison X-Ray Vision|last=King|first=Gilbert|date=14 March 2012|website=smithsonianmag.com|publisher=|access-date=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s, X-ray machines were used in stores to help sell footwear. These were known as [[Shoe-fitting fluoroscope]]s. However, as the harmful effects of [[X-ray]] [[radiation]] were properly considered, they finally fell out of use. Shoe-fitting use of the device was first banned by the state of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1957. (They were more a clever marketing tool to attract customers, rather than a fitting aid.) Together with [[Robert J. Van de Graaff]], [[John G. Trump]] developed one of the first million-volt X-ray generators.

==Overview==
An X-ray imaging system consists of a generator control console where the operator selects desired techniques to obtain a quality readable image(kVp, mA and exposure time), an x-ray generator which controls the x-ray tube current, x-ray tube kilovoltage and x-ray emitting exposure time, an [[X-ray tube]] that converts the kilovoltage and mA into actual x-rays and an image detection system which can be either a film (analog technology) or a digital capture system and a [[picture archiving and communication system|PACS]].

==Applications==
X-ray machines are used in [[health care]] for visualising bone structures, during surgeries (especially orthopedic) to assist surgeons in reattaching broken bones with screws or structural plates, assisting cardiologists in locating blocked arteries and guiding stent placements or performing angioplasties and for other dense tissues such as [[tumour]]s. Non-medicinal applications include [[security]] and material analysis.

===Medicine===
[[Image:Mobile X-ray machine.jpg|thumb|right|Mobile fluoroscopy units can produce images continuously.]]
The main fields in which x-ray machines are used in medicine are [[radiography]], radiotherapy, and fluoroscopic type procedures.

[[fluoroscopy|Radiogr]][[Radiography|aphy]] is generally used for fast, highly penetrating images, and is usually used in areas with a high bone content but can also be used to look for tumors such as with mammography imaging. Some forms of radiography include:
*[[orthopantomogram]] — a panoramic x-ray of the [[jaw]] showing all the teeth at once
*[[mammography]] — x-rays of [[breast tissue]]
*[[tomography]] — x-ray imaging in sections

[[Radiotherapy]] — the use of x-ray radiation to treat malignant and benign [[cancer cell]]s, a non-imaging application

[[Fluoroscopy]] is used in cases where real-time visualization is necessary (and is most commonly encountered in everyday life at [[airport security]]). Some medical applications of fluoroscopy include:
*[[angiography]] — used to examine [[blood vessel]]s in real time along with the placement of stents and other procedures to repair blocked arteries.
*[[barium enema]] — a procedure used to examine problems of the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and lower [[gastrointestinal tract]]
*[[barium swallow]] — similar to a barium enema, but used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract
*[[biopsy]] — the removal of tissue for examination

X-rays are highly penetrating, [[ionizing radiation]], therefore X-ray machines are used to take pictures of dense tissues such as bones and teeth. This is because bones absorb the radiation more than the less dense [[soft tissue]]. X-rays from a source pass through the body and onto a photographic cassette.  Areas where radiation is absorbed show up as lighter shades of grey (closer to white). This can be used to diagnose broken or fractured bones. In fluoroscopy, imaging of the digestive tract is done with the help of a [[radiocontrast|radiocontrast agent]] such as [[barium sulfate]], which is opaque to X-rays.

=== Security ===
[[Image:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Hand-luggage inspection machine at Berlin Schönefeld Airport.]]
X-ray machines are used to screen objects non-invasively. Luggage at [[airport security|airport]]s and student baggage at some [[School#School security|school]]s are examined for possible weapons, including bombs. Prices of these Luggage X-rays vary from $50,000 to $300,000. The main parts of an X-ray Baggage Inspection System are the generator used to generate x-rays, the detector to detect radiation after passing through the baggage, signal processor unit (usually a PC) to process the incoming signal from the detector, and a conveyor system for moving baggage into the system. Portable pulsed X-ray Battery Powered X-ray Generator used in Security as shown in the figure provides EOD responders safer analysis of any possible target hazard.

==== Operation ====
When baggage is placed on the conveyor, it is moved into the machine by the operator. There is an [[infrared]] transmitter and receiver assembly to detect the baggage when it enters the tunnel. This assembly gives the signal to switch on the generator and signal processing system. The signal processing system processes incoming signals from the detector and reproduce an image based upon the type of material and material density inside the baggage. This image is then sent to the display unit.

==== Color classification ====
[[Image:Xray-verkehrshaus.jpg|thumb|X-ray image of a backpack. Organic and inorganic materials are discriminated in using dual energy techniques.]]
The colour of the image displayed depends upon the material and material density : organic material such as paper, clothes and most explosives are displayed in orange. Mixed materials such as aluminum are displayed in green. Inorganic materials such as copper are displayed in blue and non-penetrable items are displayed in black (some machines display this as a yellowish green or red). The darkness of the color depends upon the density or thickness of the material.

The material density determination is achieved by two-layer detector. The layers of the detector pixels are separated with a strip of metal. The metal absorbs soft rays, letting the shorter, more penetrating wavelengths through to the bottom layer of detectors, turning the detector to a crude two-band spectrometer.

A film of [[carbon nanotube]]s (as a cathode) that emits electrons at room temperature when exposed to an electrical field has been fashioned into an X-ray device. An array of these emitters can be placed around a target item to be scanned and the images from each emitter can be assembled by computer software to provide a 3-dimensional image of the target in a fraction of the time it takes using a conventional X-ray device. The system also allows rapid, precise control, enabling prospective physiological gated imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/aug06/zhounanotube080206.htm | title = UNC News release -- New method of using nanotube x-rays creates CT images faster than traditional scanners | accessdate = 2012-08-20 | author = Zhang|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineers at the [[University of Missouri]] (MU), [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], have invented a compact source of x-rays and other forms of radiation.
The radiation source is the size of a stick of gum and could be used to create portable x-ray scanners. A prototype handheld x-ray scanner using the source could be manufactured in as soon as three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.healthimaging.com/topics/diagnostic-imaging/mu-researchers-develop-super-compact-x-ray-source| title = MU researchers develop super compact x-ray source | accessdate = 2013-01-19 | author = Editorial Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;
