'''Adelaide Women's Club''' was a social club for women which operated from 1922 to 1938 in [[Adelaide, South Australia]].

==History==
The Adelaide Women's Club was founded in June 1922 by a handful of professional women led by [[Adelaide Miethke]], and incorporated later the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63927150 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXXVII, |issue=25,484 |location=South Australia |date=31 August 1922 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Club premises were located in upstairs rooms previously operated by the [[YWCA]] on Grenfell Street, but soon moved to what had been Beaches Restaurant on Hindley Street, about 100 metres from King William Street. Its membership was drawn from Adelaide's business, public, professional, scientific, literary, and artistic communities, but also welcomed married women with "home duties". The Club was founded with 163 members, and by September 1923 had grown to 281. Membership was £1 a year, and the entrance fee 2/6. Facilities included library, drawing rooms, dressing rooms and a cafeteria. By March 1930 membership had grown to 320.&lt;ref name=peel/&gt;

The foundation committee consisted of secretary/manager E. Gill (Eileen?), and president Adelaide Miethke, with two vice presidents [[Amy Tomkinson]] and [[Phebe Watson]], treasurer Gertrude May Fulston JP (1893–1954), and six ordinary members. Trustees were Adelaide Miethke, Phebe Watson, Gertrude May Fulston, and [[Mabel Gilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63783426 |title=How Women Club in Adelaide |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)]] |volume=12, |issue=593 |location=South Australia |date=22 September 1923 |accessdate=7 March 2016 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Committee membership remained stable for many years, with [[Meta Buring]] (1875–1955) being one of the few new faces.

In 1930 a wall of their building collapsed, followed by a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article73790998 |title=Adelaide Women's Club: Vicissitudes and Victory |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |location=South Australia |date=25 March 1930 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the committee saw this as an opportunity to move from Hindley Street to larger premises in the White Hart building, Peel Street, just around the corner; additional facilities included a bathroom, five bedrooms and a balcony.&lt;ref name=peel&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128986414 |title=Women's Club |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XIV, |issue=2,073 |location=South Australia |date=8 March 1930 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new premises, the Club enjoyed a surge in membership, and Mrs. Decimus Smith, née Irene France (1884–1966) was appointed business manager. Prominent members from around this time were the singer [[Charlotte Grivell]] (1901–1981) and [[Lady Hore-Ruthven]] (also known as Lady Gowrie).

For practically the whole life of the Club, [[Alliance Française]] met at the Club rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article132204744 |title=Social Chat for Women |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XXVI, |issue=4,003 |location=South Australia |date=21 May 1936 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=18 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations to use the Club's facilities were the United Arts Club,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128987871 |title=United Arts Club |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XIV, |issue=2,071 |location=South Australia |date=6 March 1930 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Council of Women also held their meetings at the Club, which they made their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37287840 |title=Women's Centenary Council |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |location=South Australia |date=15 May 1935 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=21 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various Old Scholars' groups held their reunions there, as did the [[Advanced School for Girls]] for their annual bridge night,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131919747 |title=Bridge Party For Old Scholars |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XXXI, |issue=4,765 |location=South Australia |date=1 November 1938 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the last functions to be held in the clubrooms.

The Club went into recess in December 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131920541 |title=Holiday Plans Of Women's Societies |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)]] |volume=XXXI, |issue=4,803 |location=South Australia |date=15 December 1938 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |page=18 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and never reopened. No public announcement was made regarding its closure either before or after.

In Indian culture, the '''Agnivanshi''' are people who claim descent from [[Agni]], the [[Vedic]] god of fire. The Agnivanshi lineage ('''Agnivansha''' or '''Agnikula''') is one of the three lineages into which the [[Rajput clans]] are divided, the others being the [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] (descended from [[Surya]], the sun god) and the [[Chandravanshi]] (descended from [[Chandra]], the moon god). According to medieval legends, there are four Agnivanshi clans: [[Chauhan]]s (Chahamanas), [[Parihar]]s (Pratiharas), [[Parmar]]s (Paramaras) and [[Solanki (clan)|Solankis]] (Chaulukyas).&lt;ref name="Mehta1980"&gt;{{citation |author=Jaswant Lal Mehta |title=Advanced Study in the History of Medieval India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUk5k5AN54sC&amp;pg=PA34|year=1980|publisher=Sterling |isbn=978-81-207-0617-0 |page=34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|There are numerous variant spellings of these clan names.}}

Several Indian communities and dynasties have legends of fire-born ancestry. [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] theorises that the fire-lineage legends signify a new class of [[Kshatriya]] warriors, as opposed to the earlier warriors who claimed descent from the [[solar dynasty|solar]] and [[lunar dynasty|lunar]] lineages mentioned in the ancient texts. Among the clans now known as the Rajputs, the legend might have been invented by Padmagupta, a 10th-century court poet of the [[Paramara dynasty]]. His ''Nava-Sahasanka-Charita'' is the earliest source claiming an Agnivanshi origin for the Paramaras. He might have been motivated by the fact that the Paramaras were the only royal family in their region without a mythical account of heroic or divine origin. The 16th century Rajput bards might have extended the legend to include other imperial dynasties, in order to foster Rajput unity against Muslims.

== Paramara legends ==

Among the dynasties that are now called Rajputs, the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramara]] kings of Malwa were the first to claim an ''Agnikula'' ("fire clan") ancestry. Several inscriptions and literary works composed during the Paramara era mention this legend.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=32}} The earliest known source to mention this story is the ''Nava-sahasanka-charita'' of the Paramara court poet Padmagupta Parimala. The Sanskrit-language epic was composed during the reign of [[Sindhuraja]] (ca. 997-1010). Its version of the legend is as follows:{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=444}}

{{Quote box
|title = The Agnikula legend of ''Nava-Sahasanka-Charita''
|quote  = On Mount Arbuda ([[Mount Abu|Abu]]), the priest of [[Ikshvaku]] royal house ([[Vashistha]]) once made a sacred grove. The son of Gadhi ([[Vishvamitra]]) stole the [[kamadhenu|wish-granting cow]] of Vashistha, just like [[Kartavirya Arjuna]] had once stole the cow of [[Jamadagni]]. The [[barkcloth]] on the bosom of [[Arundhati (Hinduism)|Arundhati]] (Vashistha's wife) became soaked with tears. The earliest of the knowers of [[Atharva Veda]] (Vashistha) then made a [[homa (ritual)|fire offering]] with [[mantra]]s. A hero with a bow, a crown and golden armour emerged from the fire. He brought back Vashistha's cow. The grateful owner of the cow named this hero "Paramara" ("slayer of the enemy"), and gave him the power to rule the entire earth. From this hero, who resembled [[Shraddhadeva Manu|Manu]], sprang the (Paramara) dynasty.
}}

Padmagupta's ''Nava-sahasanka-charita'' is based on the life of Sindhuraja, but is of little historical value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKIfAAAAMAAJ |title=Historical biography in Indian literature |editor=Siba Pada Sen |publisher=Institute of Historical Studies |year=1979 |page=30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legend is not mentioned in earlier Paramara inscriptions (such as the [[Harsola copper plates]]) or literary works (such as [[Halayudha]]'s ''Mritasanjivani''). Therefore, K. N. Seth concludes that Padmagupta invented the legend in late 10th century. By this time, all of the Paramaras' neighbouring dynasties claimed descent from mythical heroes or gods: the Pratiharas from [[Lakshmana]], the Chahamanas (Chauhans) from [[Surya]] (Sun), the Chaulukyas from [[Brahma]]'s water pot (''chaluka''), and the [[Chandela]]s from [[Chandra]] (Moon). The Paramaras were the only ones without a legend of mythical origin. This might have motivated Padmagupta to invent a new legend with Sindhuraja's approval.{{sfn|Seth|1978|pp=10-13}}

The post-Sindhuraja Paramara inscriptions and literary works widely mention the Agnikula myth. The Paramara inscriptions which mention this legend include the ''Udapur Prashasti'' inscription, the Nagpur stone inscription, the Vasantagarh inscription, the Arthuna inscription of Chamundaraja, the Neminath Jain temple inscription, the Donagaragrama inscription, the Patnarayan inscription and the [[Jagadeva#Jainad inscription|Jainad inscription]].{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=32}} ''Tilaka-Manjari'' by Dhanapala, a contemporary of the Paramara king [[Bhoja]], also supports this account.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=3}}

== Chauhan accounts ==

The earliest of the [[Chauhan]] inscriptions and literary works do not claim Agnivanshi descent. These sources variously state that the dynasty's legendary founder Chahamana was born from [[Indra]]'s eye, in the lineage of the sage Vatsa, in the [[solar dynasty]] and/or during a ritual sacrifice performed by [[Brahma]].{{sfn|Singh|1964|pp=10-12}}

Some recensions of ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', an epic poem by [[Chand Bardai]], contain a legend similar to the Paramara legend. However, this version does not present the sages Vashistha and Vishwamitra as rivals. It goes like this:{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=445-446}}{{sfn|Sharma|1959|pp=3-4}}
{{Quote box
|title = The Agnikula legend of ''Prithviraj Raso''
|quote  = One day, [[Agastya]], [[Gautama Maharishi|Gautama]], Vashistha, Vishwamitra and other great [[rishi|sages]] started a major sacrificial ceremony on Arbuda (Mount Abu). The [[daitya|demons]] interrupted this ceremony by polluting it with flesh, blood, bones and urine. To get rid of these demons, Vashistha performed a [[Homa (ritual)|homa ritual]] (fire offering) . This led to the appearance of a hero named Pratihara ("door-keeper"), whom Vashistha placed on the road leading to the palace. After this, a hero named [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chalukka]] appeared from the hollowed palm (''chalu'') of [[Brahma]]. Next, a third hero appeared whom the sage named Pavara (or Para-mara, "slayer of the enemy"). However, these three heroes were not able to stop the demons. Vashistha then dug up a new ''yajna-kunda'' (fire pit), and made another offering to the fire, to conjure up a new hero. This four-armed hero held a sword, a shield, a bow and an arrow. Vashistha named him Chahavana (Chauhan), coronated him with Vedic hymns, and then ordered him to fight the demons. The sage also requested the goddess [[Ashapura Mata|Ashapura]] to help the hero. Chahuhvana killed the demon Yantraketu, while the goddess killed the demon Dhumraketu. On seeing this, the other demons fled. Pleased with Chahuvana's bravery, the goddess agreed to be his [[kuladevata|family deity]]. [[Prithviraj Chauhan]], the hero of ''Prithiviraj Raso'', was born in this family.
}}

''Prithviraj Raso'' is the earliest source that includes four different Rajput dynasties (not just the Paramaras) in this legend. Scholars such as [[Dasharatha Sharma]] and [[C. V. Vaidya]], who analyzed the earliest available copies of ''Prithviraj Raso'', concluded that its original recension did not contain this legend at all.{{sfn|Majumdar|1956|p=9}} The earliest extant copy of ''Prithviraj Raso'', dated to 15th century, contains only one sentence regarding the origin of Chauhan dynasty: it states that [[Manik Rai|Manikya Rai]] was the first valiant Chauhan, and he was born from Brahma's sacrifice.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=447}} R. B. Singh believes that the 16th century poets came up with the legend to foster Rajput unity against the [[Mughal Emperor|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]].{{sfn|Singh|1964|pp=17-18}}

Adaptions of the ''Prithviraj Raso'' legend occur in later works written under the patronage of the various Chauhan dynasties. One notable adaption is found in ''Hammira Raso'' (1728 CE), which describes the life of [[Hammir Dev Chauhan|Hammira-deva]], the [[Chahamanas of Ranastambhapura|Chauhan king of Ranthambore]]. It was composed by Jodharaja, a court poet of prince Chandrabhana of [[Neemrana]]. Its version of the legend is as follows:{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|pp=448-449}}

{{Quote box
|title = The Agnikula legend of ''Hammira Raso''
|quote  = [[Parashurama]] slaughtered [[Kshatriyas]] (warriors) 21 times. The only escapees were those who disguised themselves as women, those who fled leaving behind their swords and those who fell at his feet. The absence of any warriors led to a dark age, where [[rakshasa]]s (demons) increased in number, [[Vedas]] came to be trampled under feet, and Hinduism was forgotten. The sages then visited Parashurama's cave on Mount Abu. There, all the gods, men and [[nāga]]s assembled and came up with a plan to destroy the demons. Vashistha erected a fire altar and worshipped [[Shiva]], who appeared before the sages. But the demons disrupted the ceremony by throwing impurities like blood, flesh and garbage on the altar. Twenty sages, including their leader Vashistha, then invoked Brahma and Shiva. They erected a new altar and conducted a fresh ceremony, singing hymns from the ''[[Sama Veda]]''. Following this, four sword-bearing warriors emerged from the fire pit, and defeated the demons. Parashurama and [[Shakti]] blessed the newly created heroes. Chohan, one of the heroes, was four-armed. The sage [[Bhrigu]] told him that he would be protected by the goddess [[Shakti]] in his endeavours to kill the demons. The goddess protected Chohan from all dangers: every time he fell at her feet, his strength doubled and he was able to slay the demons. The goddess came to be known as Ashapuri because she fulfilled the hopes ("asha") of the sages.
}}

A slight variation occurs in the writings of Surya Malla Mishrana, the court poet of [[Bundi State|Bundi]]. In this version, the various gods create the four heroes on Vashistha's request.{{sfn|Singh|1964|p=16}} According to the bardic tale of the [[Khilchipur State|Khichi]] clan of Chauhans, the Parwar (Paramara) was born from [[Shiva]]'s essence; the Solankhi (Solanki) or Chaluk Rao (Chaulukya) was born from Brahma's essence; the Pariyar (Parihar) was born from Devi's essence; and the Chahuvan (Chauhan) was born from the [[Agni|fire]].{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=6}} The myth also appears with some variations in the [[Sisana]] inscription of the Chauhans of Bedla, and the ''Khyat'' of [[Muhnot Nainsi|Nainsi]].{{sfn|Sharma|1959|p=4}}

== Other accounts ==

''Dvyasraya-Mahakavya'', an account of the [[Chaulukya dynasty]] (Solankis) by [[Hemachandra]] (c. 1088-1173 CE), mentions the Agnikula legend while describing the origin of the Paramaras.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=33}} The Chaulukyas knew about the Agnikula legend, but associated it with the Paramaras, not themselves.{{sfn|Asoke Kumar Majumdar|1956|p=9}}

The ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'', some of whose portions date as late as the 19th century, also contains the legend with some variations. In this version, the [[Kanyakubja Brahmins]] conducted a sacrifice on Mount Abu to appease [[Brahma]]. The recital of the [[Vedas|Vedic]] mantras produced four [[Kshatriya]] heroes: [[Samaveda|Samavedi]]n Paramara, Yajurvedin Chahumana ([[Chauhan]]), Trivedin Shukla and [[Atharvaveda|Atharvavedin]] Parihara ([[Pratihara]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6_pIRnv1K8C |title=Vikrama Volume |publisher=Scindia Oriental Institute |year=1948 |page=597 |oclc=673844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=3}}

[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu'l Fazl]] mentions another variation of the legend in his ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'': In 761 BCE, a sage called Mahabaha kindled a flame and established a fire temple, which started attracting several devotees. Later, the [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], unhappy with these [[Brahmanism|Brahminical]] rites, managed to get an order prohibiting this style of worship. The fire temple devotees then prayed to seek a hero who would overthrow Buddhism and restore their traditional faith. The "Supreme Justice" then conjured a hero from the now-cold fire temple. This hero, called Dhananjaya (or Dhanji), attained power in a short time and restored the Brahminical rites. He came to Malwa from Deccan, and established a government there. When his fifth-generation descendant Putaraja died childless, the nobles elected one Aditya Ponwar as his successor. The Paramara dynasty descended from Ponwar.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=34}}

== Interpretations ==

Padmagupta's legend appears to be based on a similar story mentioned in ''[[Balakanda]]'' of the ''[[Ramayana]]'' (1:53:18 — 1:54:3). In this story, Vishvamitra (initially a Kshatriya) snatches Vashistha's [[Kamadhenu]] cow (called "Shabala"). With Vashistha's permission, the cow creates the non-Indo-Aryan warriors who defeat Vishvamitra's army. These warriors include the [[Barbaras]], the [[Kambojas]], the [[Pahlavas]], the [[Shakas]], and the [[Yavana]]s.{{sfn|Sharma|1959|p=4}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=458}} The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' repeats this legend with some variations. In this version, the stolen cow (called "Nandini") retaliates by creating the various [[mleccha]] tribes from different parts of her body. Seeing the power of the Brahmin Vashistha, Vishvamitra decides to become a Brahmin as well.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|pp=458-459}}

Some [[British India|colonial-era]] historians interpreted the Agnikula myth to suggest a foreign origin for the Agnivanshi Rajputs. According to this theory, the foreign ancestors of these Rajputs came to India after the decline of the [[Gupta Empire]] around 5th century CE. They were admitted in the [[Hindu caste system]] after performing a fire ritual.{{sfn|Yadava|1982|p=35}} [[James Tod]], who relied on bardic legends, was the first to propose this theory.{{sfn|Singh|1964|pp=20-25}} He speculated that the Agnivashi Rajputs, who were of "good-stature and fair", could not have descended from the "dark, diminutive and ill-favoured" aboriginal natives of India. He proposed that their ancestors were [[Scythians]] and other groups residing beyond the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains.{{sfn|Singh|1964|p=20}} [[A. M. T. Jackson]] proposed a similar theory, but argued that the Rajputs had originated from [[Gurjar]]s, who according to him, came to India as part of invading hordes. The basis for his theory was the Agnivanshi myth, and the prevalence of surnames such as Pavar (Parmar) and Chavan (Chauhan) among Gurjars.{{sfn|Singh|1964|p=25-26}} The theory was further supported by other British scholars as well as some Indian scholars, such as [[D. R. Bhandarkar]].{{sfn|Singh|1964|p=27}} [[William Crooke]] theorised that the demons referred to in the Agnikula legend were [[Buddhist]] rivals of the Brahmins.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=454}} He argued that the Kshatriya descent was based on status rather than descent, and therefore [[Brahmin]]s conducted a purification or initiation fire ritual to raise the status of foreign warriors who helped them repress the Buddhists.{{sfn|Singh|1964|p=27}}

The foreign-origin theory has been criticised by several later scholars. [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] states that the colonial historians saw the foreign-origin theory as a way of justifying their own colonial invasion.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=439}} R. B. Singh criticises Indian supporters of the theory for having failed to see the "subtle game" of the colonial historians.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=439-440}}

Hiltebeitel argues that the ''Ramayana'' story cannot be the origin of the Agnikula myth, because it has nothing to do with birth from fire.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=459}} There are other mythological legends involving sages and birth of warriors, which do not support the foreign-origin theory. For example, the ''Ramayana'' also mentions that Vashistha and [[Rishyasringa]] performed a ceremony that resulted in the birth of [[Rama]] and his three brothers. The ''Pratisarga-Parvan'' of ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'' mentions a legend according to which the Brahmins destroyed the mlecchas by pulling them into a sacrificial fire pit (rather than creating them from it).{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=461}} Besides, the fire-origin legend is not unique to the Rajputs. There are several south Indian legends of fire-born dynasties and communities:

* The [[Tamil language|Tamil]] work ''[[Purananuru]]'', which predates the Paramaras, mentions a fire-born chief: the ruler of Tuvarai (identified with [[Dvārakā]]). This ruler, who was an ancestor of Pulikatimal [[Irunkovel]] of Arayam, came out of "the sacrificial fire-pit of the [[Rishi]]".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|pp=462-463}}
* An inscription issued during the reign of [[Kulothunga Chola III]] (r. c. 1178-1218 CE) also mentions a fire-born legend. According to it, the [[Idangai]] ("left-hand") castes were created from the ''agni-kunda'' (fire pit) to protect the sacrificial ceremony of the sage [[Kashyapa]]. They migrated from [[Antarvedi]] to the Chola country as attendants of migrant Brahmins, during the reign of the emperor Arindama.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=465}}
* The legends of the [[Telugu-language|Telugu]] speaking castes [[Balija]]s (including their offshoots [[Kavarai]]s and Janappans) and [[Thogataveera|Togatas]] claim that their ancestors were born from sacrificial fire-pits.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=465}}
* A [[Vanniyar]] legend claims that their ancestor Rudra Vanniya Maharaja (or Vira-Vanniyan) was born from the flames of a fire sacrifice. This sacrifice was performed by the sage Jambava (also Champuva or Shambhu) to ward off the demons Vatapi and Mahi. Vira-Vanniyan had fours sons, and his family defeated the demons with the help of the goddess [[Durga]].{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|pp=467-468}}
* The 15th century Tamil ''Mahabharata'' of Villiputtur Alvar makes three references to Agnivanshi (fire), [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] (solar) and [[Chandravanshi]] (lunar) dynasties. One particular segment describes the [[Chola]] king as from the solar dynasty, the [[Pandyan]] king as from the lunar dynasty and the [[Chera]] king as from the fire dynasty. The more ancient ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' alludes to the [[solar dynasty|solar]] ancestry of the Cholas and the [[lunar dynasty|lunar]] ancestry of the Pandyas, but remains silent on the ancestry of the Cheras. The ''Tiruvilayatar Puranam'' (or ''Thiruvilaiyadal puranam''), possibly from the 17th century, repeats the Villiputtur Alvar's account.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|pp=471-472}}

Hiltebeitel notes that the common theme among all these "fire-origin" legends is not the theft of a cow: rather, it is the creation of a new order of Kshatriyas (as opposed to the traditional [[solar dynasty|solar]] and [[lunar dynasty|lunar]] Kshatriyas mentioned in the ancient sources).{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=473}} Hiltebeitel further theorises that the Agnikula myth is of south Indian origin,{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=470}} and may have been transmitted to northern India by the feudatories of the [[Pallavas]] and the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]].{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=475}} He suggests that the Tamil-language ''Silappatikaram'' legend is "an Agnikula myth waiting to be realized". It mentions solar and lunar ancestry of the Cholas and Pandyas respectively, but remains silent on the ancestry of the Cheras. According to a legend in this text, after the destruction of the Chola and the Pandya capitals (the latter by ''agni'' or fire), it is the Chera king who redeems the royals by establishing the worship of [[Kannagi]].{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=474}} Besides the south Indian legends of fire-origin, Hiltebeitel also connects the [[Chaulukya]]s (Solanki Rajputs) to the south Indian [[Chalukyas of Kalyani]] in his support. Before the popularisation of the Agnikula myth, both these dynasties claimed origin from [[Brahma]]'s ''chaluka'' (folded palm or water-pot). The [[Guhilot]] Rajputs of [[Mewar]] as well as the Chaulukyas of Gujarat are known to have employed Brahmins from Deccan for fabricating their myths of origin.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=469-470}} [[D. C. Sircar]] also suggested that the Paramara court poet Padmagupta might also have been a native of southern India. According to Paramara inscriptions, his patron [[Vakpati Munja]] had achieved military successes in southern India.{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|1999|p=470}}

According to K. N. Seth, the foreign-origin theory is weakened by the fact that the Agnikula legend is not mentioned in the earliest of the Paramara records (such as the [[Harsola copper plates]]).{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=16}} Moreover, the earliest Paramara-era accounts do not mention the other Rajput clans as fire-born.{{sfn|Seth|1978|p=16}} The early Chauhan dynasties were centered around [[Ajmer]]-[[Pushkar]] region, and their association with Mount Abu is a later invention.{{sfn|Singh|1964|p=23}}

R. B. Singh argues that if the ancestors of Rajputs were the Indo-Aryan natives of north-western India, Tod's claim of stark differences between the appearances of the Scythians and the natives is misleading, as both the groups have [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European]] origins.{{sfn|Singh|1964|p=22}}

==Ware Group==

[[Nathan Witt]] had succeeded [[Harold Ware]] as leader of the underground [[Ware group|Ware Group]] of Soviet spies upon Ware's death in 1935, while [[Whittaker Chambers]] oversaw the group and couriered Government documents it obtained from Washington to New York.&lt;ref name=Witness&gt;

In 1936, Rosenberg was working "as an unpaid volunteer" for the [[Robert M.

In 1937, he transferred briefly to the [[Railroad Retirement Board]] and then in April 1937 joined the [[National Labor Relations Board]] through 1941 at the suggestion of [[Max Lowenthal]].&lt;ref name=HUAC1952&gt;

That same year, he also joined the [[National Lawyers Guild]] (where he was a member as a late as 1956 during his second appearance before [[HUAC]]).&lt;ref name=HUAC1956 /&gt;

Witt placed Rosenberg in charge of a group of six to eight attorneys during a Congressional investigation into the questionable activities of the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NRLB) in 1938 and 1939.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Perlo Group==

In 1941, Rosenberg transferred from the NRLB to the Board of Economic Warfare (or Office of Economic Warfare).&lt;ref name=HUAC1956 /&gt;

"A couple of years later," he joined the Foreign Economic Administration (FEA).&lt;ref name=HUAC1956 /&gt;

Rosenberg was a friend of [[Charles Kramer (economist)|Charles Kramer]] (the only member of the Ware Group known to continue on into the [[Perlo group|Perlo Group]]).  Rosenberg was also an amateur photographer with a dark room in his home.&lt;ref name=Spies&gt;

Rosenberg was a member of the [[Perlo group]] of Soviet spies during [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In November 1943, [[Earl Browder]] turned control of the group over to [[Jacob Golos]] two months before his death and it subsequently was taken over by [[Elizabeth Bentley]].

While employed as the Chief of the Economic Institution Staff for the [[Foreign Economic Administration]], Rosenberg allegedly supplied the [[Soviet Union]] with voluminous observations, recommendations, plans and proposals made by various government officials concerning the handling of postwar Germany.  He also worked on the [[Board of Economic Warfare]] since 1941.  Rosenberg's name appears in clear text in a December 1944 Venona decrypt as the source of a [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] memo. Rosenberg appears in the [[Venona project]] under his real name.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In April 1951, Rosenberg argued ''Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath'' before the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Swedish Arabs''' are citizens and residents of [[Sweden]] who emigrated from nations in the [[Arab world]].

==Migration history==
Many of the Arabs in Sweden are migrants from [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], [[Jordan]] and [[Yemen]].

In September 2013, Swedish migration authorities ruled that all Syrian asylum seekers will be granted permanent residency in light of [[Syrian Civil War|the worsening conflict in Syria]]. [[Sweden]] is the first [[Member state of the European Union|EU-country]] to make this offer.&lt;ref name="syriswe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweden offers residency to all Syrian refugees |url=http://www.thelocal.se/50030/20130903/ |publisher=[[The Local]] |accessdate=3 September 2013 |date=3 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904224518/http://www.thelocal.se/50030/20130903/ |archivedate=4 September 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision means that the roughly 8,000 Syrians who have [[temporary residency]] in Sweden will now be able to stay in the country permanently. They will also have the right to bring their families to Sweden. While Malek Laesker, vice-chair of the Syrian Arabian Cultural Association of Sweden, welcomed the decision, he also warned it could create problems. "The fact that Sweden is the first country to open its arms is both positive and negative," he told the [[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT news agency]], explaining that it may be a boon for the growing [[people-smuggling]] market.&lt;ref name="syriswe"/&gt;

'''Arctic sea ice decline''' is the [[sea ice]] loss observed in recent decades in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report]] states that [[Radiative forcing#Forcing due to atmospheric gas|greenhouse gas forcing]] is largely, but not wholly, responsible for the decline in Arctic sea ice extent. A study from 2011 suggested that internal variability enhanced the greenhouse gas forced sea ice decline over the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Inter-annual to multi-decadal Arctic sea ice extent trends in a warming world|date= August 22, 2011|doi=10.1029/2011GL048008|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|authors=Jennifer E.

==Definitions==
The [[Arctic Ocean]] is the mass of water positioned approximately above latitude 65° N. [[Arctic ice pack|Arctic Sea Ice]] refers to the area of the Arctic Ocean covered in ice. The ''Arctic sea ice minimum'' is the day in a given year when Arctic sea ice reaches its smallest extent. It occurs at the end of the summer melting season, normally during September. ''Arctic Sea ice maximum'' is the day of a year when Arctic sea ice reaches its largest extent near the end of the Arctic cold season, normally during March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/seaice.html|title=Quick Facts on Arctic Sea Ice|author=NSIDC|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical data visualizations for Arctic sea ice include average monthly measurements or graphs for the annual minimum or maximum extent, as shown in the adjacent images.

==Observation==

[[File:Annual Arctic Sea Ice Minimum 1979-2015 with Area Graph.webm|thumb|An animation of the annual Arctic sea ice minimum with a graph overlay showing the area of the minimum sea ice in millions of square kilometres.]]
An article in [[Popular Mechanics]], published in March 1912, described open waters in the Arctic regions in 1911, a year with exceptional above average temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/PopularMechanics1912/Popular_Mechanics_03_1912#page/n85/mode/2up|publisher=Popular Mechanics|author=Francis Molena|year=1912|title=Remarkable Weather of 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellite era===
[[File:2018 Sea Ice Extent Visualization.gif|thumb|2018 sea ice extent visualization.]]
Observation with satellites show that Arctic sea ice area, extent, and volume have been in decline for a few decades. Sometime during the 21st century, sea ice may effectively cease to exist during the summer. Sea ice extent is defined as the area with at least 15% ice cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daily Updated Time series of Arctic sea ice area and extent derived from SSMI data provided by NERSC |url=http://arctic-roos.org/observations/satellite-data/sea-ice/ |accessdate=14 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910091853/http://arctic-roos.org/observations/satellite-data/sea-ice |archivedate=10 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of multi-year sea ice in the Arctic has declined considerably in recent decades. In 1988, ice that was at least 4 years old accounted for 26% of the Arctic's sea ice. By 2013, ice that age was only 7% of all Arctic sea ice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/feb/21/arctic-ice-melt-video Watch 27 years of 'old' Arctic ice melt away in seconds] The Guardian  21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists recently measured sixteen-foot (five-meter) [[wave heights]] during a storm in the [[Beaufort Sea]] in mid-August until late October 2012. This is a new phenomenon for the region, since a permanent sea ice cover normally prevents wave formation.  Wave action breaks up sea ice, and thus could become a feedback mechanism, driving sea ice decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/07/29/huge-waves-measured-for-first-time-in-arctic-ocean/|title=Huge waves measured for first time in Arctic Ocean|date=July 29, 2014|author=Hannah Hickey|publisher=[[University of Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For January 2016, the satellite based data showed the lowest overall Arctic sea ice extent of any January since records begun in 1979. Bob Henson from Wunderground noted:
{{quote|Hand in hand with the skimpy ice cover, temperatures across the Arctic have been extraordinarily warm for midwinter. Just before New Year’s, a slug of mild air pushed temperatures above freezing to within 200 miles of the North Pole. That warm pulse quickly dissipated, but it was followed by a series of intense North Atlantic cyclones that sent very mild air poleward, in tandem with a strongly negative [[Arctic oscillation]] during the first three weeks of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/absurd-january-warmth-in-arctic-brings-recordlow-sea-ice-extent|title=Absurd January Warmth in Arctic Brings Record-Low Sea Ice Extent|year=2016|publisher=Wunderground}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The January 2016's remarkable phase transition of Arctic oscillation was driven by a [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073012/abstract rapid tropospheric warming in the Arctic], a pattern that appears to have increased surpassing the so-called stratospheric sudden warming.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, S.-Y.

Rasch (2017), Accelerated increase in the Arctic tropospheric warming events surpassing stratospheric warming events during winter, Geophys. Res. Lett., 44, doi:10.1002/2017GL073012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The previous record of the lowest area of the Arctic Ocean covered by ice in 2012 saw a low of 1.58 million square miles (4.1 million square kilometers). This replaced the previous record set on September 28, 2007 at 1.61 million square miles(4.17 million square kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/08/120828-arctic-sea-ice-global-warming-record-environment-science/?source=arctichub|title=Arctic Sea Ice Hits Record Low—Extreme Weather to Come?|date=2016-08-29|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ice-free summer==
[[File:NORTH POLE Ice (19626661335).jpg|thumb|The dark ocean surface reflects only 6 percent of incoming solar radiation, instead sea ice reflects 50 to 70 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/seaice/processes/albedo.html|title=Thermodynamics: Albedo|work=NSIDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Ponds on the Ocean, ICESCAPE.jpg|thumb|left|As ice melts, the liquid water collects in depressions on the surface and deepens them, forming these melt ponds in the [[Arctic]]. These fresh water ponds are separated from the salty sea below and around it, until breaks in the ice merge the two.]]

An "ice-free" Arctic Ocean is often defined as "having less than 1 million square kilometers of sea ice", because it is very difficult to melt the thick ice around the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/07/10/1219716110.abstract [[PNAS]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2013-08-ice-free-arctic-2050s.html#inlRlv | title=Study predicts an ice-free Arctic by the 2050s}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmos.pku.edu.cn/yhu/pnas-liu-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC AR5 defines "nearly ice-free conditions" as sea ice extent less than 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for at least five consecutive years.&lt;ref name="AR5" /&gt;

Many scientists have attempted to estimate when the Arctic will be "ice-free". Professor [[Peter Wadhams]] of the University of Cambridge is among these scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xdOTyGQOso&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Our time is running out – The Arctic sea ice is going!|last=Wadhams|first=Peter|date=20 June 2015|website=www.youtube.com|publisher=|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wadhams and several others have noted that climate model predictions have been overly conservative regarding sea ice decline.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Overland | first1 = J.

Based on the outcomes of several different models, ''Overland and Wang'' (2013) putthe early limit for a sea ice free summer Arctic near 2040.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Tipping point==
There is an ongoing debate if the Arctic Ocean has already passed a "tipping point", defined as a threshold for abrupt and irreversible change.  A 2013 study identified an abrupt transition to increased seasonal ice cover variability in 2007, which has persisted in following years.  The researchers made a distinction between a [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] and a non-bifurcation `tipping point'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A recent tipping point in the Arctic sea-ice cover: abrupt and persistent increase in the seasonal cycle since 2007|year=2013|authors=Valerie N.

=== Amplified Arctic Warming ===
Dark, open water left behind as sea ice melts absorbs vastly more heat than ice covered water, leading to physical implications that include the [[ice-albedo feedback]] or warmer sea surface temperatures which increase [[ocean heat content]]. As Peter Wadhams, a polar researcher writes "once summer ice yields to open water, the albedo... drops from 0.6 to 0.1, which will further accelerate warming of the Arctic and of the whole planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Farewell To Ice|last=Wadhams|first=Peter|publisher=Penguin|year=2016|isbn=9780241009413|location=UK|pages=4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This warming has increased to such an extent that the poles are heating approximately twice as fast as the global average, according to Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02022018/cold-weather-polar-vortex-jet-stream-explained-global-warming-arctic-ice-climate-change|title=Polar Vortex: How the Jet Stream and Climate Change Bring on Cold Snaps|date=2018-02-02|work=InsideClimate News|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Economical implications of ice free summers and the decline in Arctic ice volumes include a greater number of journeys across the Arctic Ocean Shipping lanes during the year. This number has grown from 0, in 1979 to 400–500 along the [[Bering Strait|Bering strait]] and &gt;40 along the [[Northern Sea Route]], in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/energy/great-energy-challenge/arctic-map/?source=arctichub|title=Interactive Map: The Changing Arctic|last=Society|first=National Geographic|newspaper=National Geographic|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polar Vortex Disruption ===
The [[polar vortex]] is a whirlwind of especially cold, dense air forming near the poles that is contained by the [[jet stream]], a belt of fast-flowing  winds that serves as a boundary between cold polar air and the warmer air of other hemispheres. Because the power of the polar vortex and jet stream is derived partly from the temperature contrast between cold polar air and warmer tropical air, it is at risk of becoming severely diminished as this contrast is eroded by the effects of melting sea ice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to the [[Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences]] ”there [has been] a significant change in the vortex mean state over the twenty-first century, resulting in a weaker, more disturbed vortex."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Daniel M.|last2=Osprey|first2=Scott M.|last3=Gray|first3=Lesley J.|last4=Butchart|first4=Neal|last5=Hardiman|first5=Steven C.|last6=Charlton-Perez|first6=Andrew J.|last7=Watson|first7=Peter|date=August 2012|title=The Effect of Climate Change on the Variability of the Northern Hemisphere Stratospheric Polar Vortex|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|language=en|volume=69|issue=8|pages=2608–2618|doi=10.1175/jas-d-12-021.1|issn=0022-4928}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the vortex becomes weaker, it is more likely to allow cold arctic air to escape from the confines of the jet stream and spill over into other hemispheres.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This disruption has already begun to affect global temperatures. In a 2017 study conducted by climatologist Dr. Judah Cohen and several of his research associates, Cohen wrote that “[the] shift in polar vortex states can account for ''most'' of the recent winter cooling trends over Eurasian midlatitudes”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kretschmer|first=Marlene|last2=Coumou|first2=Dim|last3=Agel|first3=Laurie|last4=Barlow|first4=Mathew|last5=Tziperman|first5=Eli|last6=Cohen|first6=Judah|date=January 2018|title=More-Persistent Weak Stratospheric Polar Vortex States Linked to Cold Extremes|journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society|language=en|volume=99|issue=1|pages=49–60|doi=10.1175/bams-d-16-0259.1|issn=0003-0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atmospheric chemistry ===
{{See also|Arctic methane release}}
Melting of sea ice releases molecular [[chlorine]], which reacts with sunlight to produce chlorine atoms. Because chlorine atoms are highly reactive, they can expedite the degradation of [[Atmospheric methane|methane]] and [[tropospheric ozone]] and the oxidation of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] to more toxic forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

One of the study researchers noted, "The expectation is that with further sea ice decline, temperatures in the Arctic will continue to rise, and so will [[atmospheric methane|methane]] emissions from northern wetlands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150917091306.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|year=2015|title=Melting Arctic sea ice accelerates methane emissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on effects of Arctic amplification (warming) and ice loss, a study in 2015 concluded that highly amplified jet-stream patterns are occurring more frequently in the past two decades, and that such patterns can not be tied to certain seasons. Additionally it was found that these jet-stream patterns often lead to persistent weather patterns that result in extreme weather events. Hence, continued heat trapping emissions favour increased formation of extreme events caused by prolonged weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophical Transactions|title=Evidence linking rapid Arctic warming to mid-latitude weather patterns|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/2045/20140170|doi=10.1098/rsta.2014.0170|pmid=26032322|authors=Jennifer Francis, Natasa Skific|date=1 June 2015|bibcode = 2015RSPTA.37340170F|volume=373|issue=2045|page=20140170|pmc=4455715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bargirl''' is a woman who is paid to entertain patrons in a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]], either individually or, in some cases, as a performer. The exact nature of the entertainment varies widely from place to place; depending on the venue this can be individual entertainment ranging from light conversation to sexual services, or more public entertainment in the form of [[go-go dancing]] or [[striptease]]. Variants on the term include "B-girl", "hostess", "juicy girl", and "guest relations officer".

Bargirls work in various types of bars throughout the world, including [[Strip club|strip clubs]] and regular bars in the U.S., [[Host and hostess clubs|hostess bars]] in East Asia, [[Go go bar|go-go bars]] and "beer bars" in Southeast Asia, [[Dance bar (India)|dance bars]] in India, and ''[[boliche (bar)|boliches]]'' in [[Argentina]].

A bargirl should not be confused with a [[bartender|barmaid]], who serves drinks in a bar but is not expected to entertain customers individually or to dance.

==Forms of entertainment provided==
In the U.S., "B-girl" (an abbreviation of "bar girl") is commonly understood to mean a woman who is paid to chat with male patrons and encourage them to buy her drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B-girl|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=B-girl&amp;searchmode=none|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-girl is usually served watered-down or non-alcoholic drinks to minimize both the effects of the alcohol and the cost to the bar. B-girls were employed by bars in the US during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name="sismondo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sismondo|first1=Christine|title=America Walks into a Bar: A Spirited History of Taverns and Saloons, Speakeasies and Grog Shops|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199752935|page=244|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQJLjeJnJ8wC&amp;pg=PA244}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her memoirs [[Maya Angelou]] describes working as a B-girl in a San Francisco [[strip club]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Singin' &amp; Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7GzuWnnqA4C|author=Maya Angelou|publisher=Hachette|year=2010|isbn=9780748122387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to entertaining customers individually, bargirls in some venues (such as strip clubs in the United States, or go-go bars in Asia) are expected to dance on stage, often in skimpy costumes such as [[bikini]]s, semi-nude, or nude.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Methods of payment==
Bargirls often receive a [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] on drinks bought by their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lighter|editor-first1=J.E.|title=Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang|date=1994|isbn=978-0394544274|page=139|quote=B-girl: a woman employed by a bar, nightclub or the like, to act as a companion to male customers and to induce them to buy drinks, and usually paid a percentage of what the customers spend.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where applicable, they may receive a percentage of the escort fee or bar fine paid by any customer who wishes to take them out of the bar. In other cases, they may have a periodic quota of drinks or bar fines, or both.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Prostitution ==
Some bargirls also act as [[prostitutes]], either on-site (with the bar effectively acting as a [[brothel]]) or by being hired upon payment of a [[Bargirl#Bar_fines|bar fine]]. This practice is especially common in [[Asia]]. In South Korea, "juicy bars" near the gates of [[United States military bases]] provide [[prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military|prostitutes for soldiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jon Rabiroff|author2=Hwang Hae-Rym|url=http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=64633|title='Juicy bars’ said to be havens for prostitution aimed at U.S. military|date=9 September 2009|access-date=13 November 2017|website =Stars and Stripes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where bargirls act as prostitutes, patterns vary widely. Some seek to have as many customers as possible in a given day; these women generally take only "short-time" clients. Others are more selective and accept only one customer per day, taking "long-time" customers overnight or even for a few days.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Bar fines===
A "bar fine" is a payment made by a customer to the operators of a bar that allows a dancer, hostess, or some other employee of that bar to leave work early, usually in order to accompany the customer outside the bar. Although it is not universal, this practice is frequently associated with venues offering [[prostitution]] to foreigners—especially in Southeast Asian countries such as [[Prostitution in Thailand|Thailand]]&lt;ref name=stickman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stickmanbangkok.com/girls.html |title=Internet Archive copy of Stickman's guide to Naughty Nightlife in Bangkok|accessdate=18 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021004052612/http://www.stickmanbangkok.com/girls.html |archivedate=October 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pattaya&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pattayanewbie.com/how.html |title=How Bars Work|work=pattayanewbie.com|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Askew&gt;{{cite book|last=Askew|first=Marc|date= |title=Bangkok: Place, practice and representation.

===Working conditions===
Working conditions vary both between and within countries; even within individual countries, conditions can vary widely between venues. For example, there is significant variation among establishments in [[Thailand]]'s [[red-light district]] in [[Pattaya]]. Some bars employ relatively well-paid women who live outside the bar, while others employ lower-paid women who live at the bar.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Legal issues===
In some countries prostitution is treated as a serious crime; in the [[Philippines]] it is covered by the [[Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9208.html Republic Act 9208]. ''Chan Robles Virtual Law Library''. Retrieved 26 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Thailand]], and in many other countries where bar fine prostitution is common, it is technically illegal but widely tolerated.&lt;ref name=Askew/&gt;

The [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] prohibits American military personnel from purchasing bar fines, which is an offense considered equal to buying the services of a prostitute.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=="B-girl activity" in the US==
B-girl activity has declined in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=B-Girls Fading Attraction in Bars Throughout U.S.|url=http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%208/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201954%20Grayscale/Schenectady%20NY%20Gazette%201954%20Grayscale%20-%209570.pdf|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette|date=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; (so much so that female [[Breakdancing|breakdancers]] now refer to themselves as B-girls), but it still occurs. Because prostitution is illegal in most parts of the U.S. and is restricted to licensed brothels in those parts of Nevada where it is legal, B-girls who act as prostitutes are breaking the law. The practice of accepting drinks for pay is specifically outlawed in many localities.&lt;ref name="quinlan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quinlan|first1=Adriane|title=In Kenner, B-drinkers will still be illegal, but don't call them girls|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/in_kenner_b-drinkers_will_stil.html|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bars have been raided and closed down for "B-girl activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peppermint Lounge's New Owner Gets OK|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/365965123.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jan+28%2C+1966&amp;author=&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%281960-1982%29&amp;desc=Peppermint+Lounge%27s+New+Owner+Gets+OK|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=January 28, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 1962 case, nightclub owners suspected of having ties to a Chicago [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]] were brought before the [[Senate Rackets Committee]]. The ''Boston Globe'' reported that "one of [the syndicate's] rackets, according to testimony, is the operation of cheap nightclubs which use B-girls to solicit watered-down drinks at high prices from customers, or even engage in prostitution with them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Warren|title=Capone Heirs Defy Senate B-Girl Probe|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/276189389.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+15%2C+1962&amp;author=ROGERS%2C+WARREN%2C+Jr&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%281960-1982%29&amp;desc=Capone+Heirs+Defy+Senate+B-Girl+Probe|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=June 15, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once common for modestly dressed B-girls to pose as secretaries who had stopped at the bar for a drink on their way home from work. The male customer, under the impression that he had found a "date" for the evening, would buy her one expensive drink after another, only to be [[wikt:jilt|jilted]] afterwards.&lt;ref name="sismondo" /&gt;

In 2014, city officials in [[Kenner, Louisiana]], where the practice is illegal, replaced the word "B-girl" with "B-drinker" in their liquor laws to avoid gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="quinlan" /&gt;

===In popular culture===
[[Marilyn Monroe]] was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe award]] for her role as a B-girl in ''[[Bus Stop (1956 film)|Bus Stop]]'' (1956). In the film, Monroe's character, Chérie, consumes four [[Long Island Iced Tea|tea-and-sodas]] before her companion catches on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Littauer|first1=Amanda|title=The B-Girl Evil: Bureaucracy, Sexuality, and the Menace of Barroom Vice in Postwar California|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=April 2003|volume=12|issue=2|pages=171–204|url=https://www.academia.edu/7442855 |doi=10.1353/sex.2003.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

B-girls are referenced in the fourth season ''[[M*A*S*H]]'' episode "Deluge".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

These terms were initially applied to [[British people]] perceived as prejudiced against the Boers, in the context of political conflict between the British and the Boers in southern Africa which culminated in the British defeat of the Boers in the Second Boer War. Accusations of ''Boerehaat'' have subsequently been made by [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalist]]s to exploit historical British prejudice against the Boers for political gain. They have applied the term ''Boerehater'' to anyone who criticised them or opposed their interests in the Cape Colony, including English-speaking [[white South African]]s, [[dissident]] Afrikaners and [[black people|black]] South Africans.

===Second Boer War===
British politician [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], writing about the attitude of [[uitlander]]s (English-speaking immigrants) towards the Boer authorities in the independent [[South African Republic|Transvaal Republic]] during the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] following the discovery of gold in 1886, states: "English became the general spoken tongue not only of Johannesburg, but of the mining districts generally. Hearing nothing but English spoken, seeing nothing all round them that was not far more English than Dutch, though English with a half-colonial, half-American tinge, it was natural that the bulk of the Uitlanders should deem themselves to be in a country which had become virtually English, and should see something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryce|first=James|title=Impressions of South Africa|date=1899|publisher=Macmillan and Co., Limited|location=London|page=409|url=https://archive.org/details/impressionsofso00bryc}}&lt;/ref&gt; British critic of imperialism [[John A.

English-speaking film critics were more lenient towards Afrikaans-language films lest they be accused of ''Boerehaat''. According to ''[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]]'' film critic Robert Greig, "An apology situation developed with the English-language newspapers who tended not to slam Afrikaans films because they didn't want to be accused of ''boerehaat'' (Boer-hater)." According to film critic [[Barry Ronge]], "The cries of ''boerehaat'' come from the industry itself when they feel they are not getting 'support'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tomaselli|first1=Keyan|title=The Cinema of Apartheid: Race and Class in South African Film|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317928409|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5xWAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an incident reminiscent of the National Party's ''Boerehaat'' propaganda campaign during apartheid, ANC deputy president [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] urged disgruntled residents of the [[Limpopo]] province to vote in the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 general election]] otherwise "the Boers will come back to control us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vote or 'Boers' will come back to power – Cyril Ramaphosa|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/vote-boers-will-come-back-power-cyril-ramaphosa/|accessdate=16 June 2014|work=City Press|date=11 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114012305/http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/vote-boers-will-come-back-power-cyril-ramaphosa|archivedate=14 November 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poplak|first1=Richard|title=The Boers are back and the 2014 shape of things to come|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-11-11-the-boers-are-back-and-the-2014-shape-of-things-to-come/#.U5__TpSSyyg|accessdate=17 June 2014|work=Daily Maverick|date=11 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113193314/http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2013-11-11-the-boers-are-back-and-the-2014-shape-of-things-to-come/|archivedate=13 November 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Boer' comment not meant to cause offence – Cyril Ramaphosa|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/boer-comment-meant-cause-offence-cyril-ramaphosa/|accessdate=17 June 2014|work=City Press|date=12 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113092653/http://www.citypress.co.za/politics/boer-comment-meant-cause-offence-cyril-ramaphosa/|archivedate=13 November 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom Front Plus]] leader [[Pieter Mulder]] described his remarks as "primitive scare tactics" and "racist and polarising".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Moloto |first1=Moloko |title=Cyril blasted over Boer comment |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/cyril-blasted-over-boer-comment-1.1605799#.U6AAJ5SSyyg |accessdate=17 June 2014 |work=The Star |date=12 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QOVqbAA2?url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/cyril-blasted-over-boer-comment-1.1605799 |archivedate=17 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Michael Neocosmos]] notes that critics of the ruling ANC can similarly be labelled as "standing outside the state-defined national consensus", with for example ''[[ad hominem]]'' accusations of [[racism]] and disloyalty replacing accusations of ''Boerehaat'' and communist sympathies which are hard to defend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neocosmos|first1=Michael|authorlink=Michael Neocosmos|title=Thinking the Impossible?

According to the 2011 census, there were 18,543 Bulgarians in Serbia. They are primarily located in two municipalities near Serbia's border with Bulgaria: in [[Bosilegrad]] there are 5,839 Bulgarians i.e. 71.9% of population while in [[Dimitrovgrad, Serbia|Dimitrovgrad]] (Tsaribrod) there are 5,413 Bulgarians or 53.5% of population.

The dominant religion among ethnic Bulgarians in Serbia is [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodoxy]]. [[Islam]] never arrived in areas like [[Bosilegrad]] because of the mountainous terrain and most inhabitants dwelled in high mountain villages where they were hard to reach. They use both [[Serbian Orthodox church|Serbian]] and [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian]] churches due to the low number of 
Bulgarian clergymen present in the region. There is a church in every village around [[Bosilegrad]], and the oldest ones date to the 11th century.

The regional names once used by many people in the Torlakian-speaking region was ''Torlaci'' and ''Šopi'' speaking a transitional speech between Bulgarian and Serbian. The borders of the region frequently shifted before the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest among [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[History of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]]  and [[Medieval Serbia|Serbian]] rulers. According to some authors during the Ottoman rule, the majority of native Torlakian Slavic population did not have distinct national consciousness in ethnic sense.&lt;ref&gt;Roudometof, Victor; Robertson, Roland (2001). Nationalism, globalization, and orthodoxy: the social origins of ethnic conflict in the Balkans. Greenwood Publishing Group. pp. 68-71. {{ISBN|0313319499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first known literary monument, influenced by Torlakian dialects is the Manuscript from [[Temštica#Temska|Temska]] Monastery from 1762, in which its author, the Monk [[Kiril Zhivkovich]] from [[Pirot]], considered his language as: "''simple Bulgarian''".&lt;ref&gt;Василев, В.П.

A [[Silesia]]n traveler stated in 1596 that the road of his trip from Sofia to Niš was filled with corpses and described the gates of Niš as standing in front of freshly beheaded heads of poor Bulgarian peasants by the Ottoman army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kultur der Nationen|page=110|url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=WDAPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=friedrich+seidel+nis&amp;dq=friedrich+seidel+nis&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4lZn4ucLQAhVHB8AKHbgfAwQQ6AEISTAF|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pirot Rebellion]] broke out in 1836, followed by the [[Niš rebellion (1841)|Niš rebellion]] in 1836, which also included Pirot. According to Ottoman statistics during the [[Tanzimat]] the greater part of the population up to the [[Sanjak of Niš]] was treated as Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/en/mp/index.htm Ottoman Bulgaria in the First Tanzimat Period — The Revolts in Nish (1841) and Vidin (1850) Mark Pinson,  Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 11, No 2 (May, 1975), pp. 103-146.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to all authors between 1840-72 the delineation between Bulgarians and Serbs is undisputed and ran north of Nis.&lt;ref name=Light&gt;{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Andrew|last2=Smith|first2=Jonathan M.|title=Philosophy and Geography II: The Production of Public Space|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847688104|url=https://books.google.bg/books?id=s2_Do4Hd8skC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=Davidovic+map+1848&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GNSaAkU3kF&amp;sig=UP5pkrWMTggdOwFuTUXctUSwk9w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHx5eYkOXTAhVELZoKHYqNB24Q6AEILzAF#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=240, 241|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian researchers (such as [[Dimitrije Davidovic]] in 1828 and [[Milan Savić (author)|Milan Savić]] in 1878) also accepted [[South Morava|Bulgarian Morava]] river as such delineation and added Niš outside the borders of the Serbian people.&lt;ref name=Light/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.bg/books?hl=bg&amp;id=IeNBAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0+%D0%91%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0+%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0+%D0%B4%D0%BE+%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8+%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5&amp;q=%22%D0%B0+%D1%83%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%22+%22%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%88%22#search_anchor|title=Istorii︠a︡ na bŭlgarskii︠a︡ narod|work=google.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also stipulated the area to be ceded to Bulgaria according to the [[Constantinople Conference]] in 1876 and most of it according to the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] in 1878. From 1870 until then the area was part of the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]], before that the area had been under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]].

Following [[World War I]], four territories, now known to the Bulgarian community as the [[Western Outlands]], passed to the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] from [[Bulgaria]] as a war indemnity, and the remains of the old border can be seen at [[Vlasina|Vlasina lake]]. In the Interwar Period, the [[Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation]], countering Yugoslav rule in the region, was engaged in repeated attacks against the Yugoslav police and army. During [[World War II]] Bulgaria retook the Western Outlands, as well as [[Pirot]] and [[Vranje]]. After the [[World War II|Second World War]], these regions were returned to Yugoslavia. After [[Serbia]]'s independence, these areas remained within Serbia.

'''Cameroonians in France''' consist of migrants from [[Cameroon]] and their descendants living and working in France.

==History==
The first [[Cameroon]]ian immigrants in [[France]] came in the [[1970s]], like the [[Congolese people in France|Congolese]], some years after the first immigrant wave from [[Black Africa]] (Senegal Valley) in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politique-africaine.com/numeros/pdf/067041.pdf|format=PDF|title=L'immigration africaine en France : regards des autres et repli sur soi |website=Politique-africaine.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But this immigration has speed up in the [[1980s]] (because of the social and economic crisis in [[Cameroon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memoireonline.com/01/09/1808/m_La-participation-des-diasporas-camerounaises-de-France-et-de-Grande-Bretagne--la-vie-politiqu1.html|title=La participation des diasporas camerounaises de France et de Grande-Bretagne à la vie politique nationale: émergence et consolidation de la citoyenneté à distance - Ruth Mireille Manga Edimo|website=Memoireonline.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become one of the most populous group of immigrants from Black Africa in France.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3106">The '''Canadian Bridge Federation''' (CBF), '''La Fédération Canadienne de Bridge''', is the primary organizational body for [[contract bridge]] in Canada. Like its American counterpart, the [[United States Bridge Federation]], the CBF promotes bridge by running tournaments for youths and adults and provides financial support for teams that represent Canada in international competition. It publishes a magazine, ''Bridge Canada''.

The federation runs a number of community outreach programs which have raised money for Canadian charities, and acts as a liaison with the [[American Contract Bridge League]] (ACBL) and [[World Bridge Federation]] (WBF), ensuring that Canadian concerns are raised with those organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbf.ca/CBFOffice/Membership.html "Support Your National Bridge Federation!"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125122235/http://cbf.ca/CBFOffice/Membership.html# |date=2009-01-25 }} (membership information). CBF.&lt;/ref&gt; The CBF also conducts the annual Canadian Bridge Championships, a multi-tournament event which includes the Canadian National Team Championships, the Canadian Women's Team Championships, the Canadian Open Pair Championships, the Canadian Senior Team Championships, and the Canadian International Master Point (IMP) Championships.&lt;ref name=chips/&gt;

The CBF was created by several prominent Canadian bridge players, including [[Eric Murray (bridge player)|Eric Murray]], during the 1965 Nationals (now called the North American Bridge Championships) in Chicago. At the time, there were more than 10,000 Canadian members of the ACBL. The federation was also a response to the 1960 World Bridge Olympiad created by the WBF - a chance for Canada to compete on an international level.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The CBF's current constitution provides for six zones, each represented by a zone director. These zones are grouped more or less according to geography, with directors in Halifax, Ville de Léry (Quebec), Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton and Vancouver. The federation's head office is in Saskatoon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbf.ca/CBFOffice/CBFcontacts.html "CBF Contacts"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213232202/http://www.cbf.ca/CBFOffice/CBFcontacts.html# |date=2010-02-13 }}.

In the 1980s, thousands of Lebanese fled their country during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and settled in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=82a759e4-0ff1-4ad5-a01d-fe09511986be Why 40,000 Canadians are in Lebanon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090942/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/story.html?id=82a759e4-0ff1-4ad5-a01d-fe09511986be# |date=2016-03-04 }}", ''canada.com'', 21 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With the return of relative stability to the country in recent years, it has become increasingly common for members of Canada's Lebanese community to return to their homeland, most commonly for summer vacations, but also to take up residence. Most of these returnees have dual Canadian-Lebanese citizenship.

Many Canadians left Lebanon and returned to Canada in the wake of the [[2006 Lebanon War]] as their houses and businesses have been destroyed during the conflict and they have no resources.

CEFORA (Argentinean Republic Committee for UFO Phenomena Studies) is an organization formed by various ufology groups in [[Argentina]]. The main purpose is the declassification of all related UFO phenomena in Argentina. It was formed by serious Argentinean ufologists in [[Victoria, Entre Rios]] during a conference.
==Background==
CEFORA is the umbrella org for UFO groups and researchers in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Open Minds, July 6, 2010 - [http://www.openminds.tv/argentinas-x-files-pt-1/4164 Argentina’s X-Files – Pt 1 Posted by: Antonio Huneeus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Info 7'' - [http://www.info7.com.mx/noticia.php?id=93930&amp;secc=19&amp;subsecc=0 Buscan la desclasificación de archivos ovni en Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization has requested heads of the National Ministry of Defense, the National Presidency and the Chamber of Deputies that they declassify all info in relation to UFO activity in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;''UFO Digest'', May 5, 2009 - [http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0509/signature.php Argentina: A One Million-Signature Goal by Scott Corrales]&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the organization is Silvia Pérez Simondini.

'''Cherkess''', or '''Cherkes''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ər|ˈ|k|ɛ|s}}; {{lang-ru|Черкесы}} ''{{lang|ru-Latn|Cherkesy}}''; {{lang-ady|Чэркэс/Шэрджэс}} ''{{lang|ady-Latn|Čerkes/Šerdžes}}''), is a term derived from the [[Russian language|Russian-language]] name for the [[Circassians]], a people of the [[North Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;James Stuart Olson, et al., eds. "Cherkess".[https://books.google.com/books?id=CquTz6ps5YgC&amp;dq ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires.''] Greenwood Publishing, 1994. p. 150. {{ISBN|9780313274978}} ''"The Beslenei (Beslenej) are located between the upper Urup and [[Khodz River|Khozdya]] rivers, and along the Middle Laba River, in the western reaches of the North Caucasus."''&lt;/ref&gt; While the term was traditionally applied to all Circassians before [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, it has since usually referred only to the Circassians living in northern [[Karachay-Cherkessia]],&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]], where they are indigenous and formed just under 12% of the population in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/perepis_itogi1612.htm {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These Circassians are mostly [[Besleney]] [[Kabardians]] who speak the [[Cherkess language|Cherkess]], i.e. Circassian, language.{{sfn|Всероссийская перепись 2010, Итоги|name=per10i4-1|loc=[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/Documents/Vol4/pub-04-01.pdf Т. 4. — Табл. 1.

The Cherkess generally call themselves ''{{lang|ady-Latn|Adyge}}'' ({{lang|ady|Адыгэ}}), as do most Circassians.&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; The name of the Cherkess was given to [[Cherkessk]], formerly called Batalpashinskaya, the capital of Karachay-Cherkessia.

==History==
{{main|Circassians#History|l1=Circassians: History}}
The Cherkess (in the narrow sense) migrated from [[Kabarda]] between 1780 and 1825, settling in the upper Zelenchuks and Urup valleys, from which they were largely displaced during the period of the 1830–1850s. During the 19th century, due to pressure from the Russia, many Cherkess moved to the [[Middle East]]ern countries, where they largely assimilated, while still living there as a distinguishable minority. Most Cherkess have converted to [[Islam]].

The political history of the Cherkess since the Russian Revolutions of 1917 is complex.  A [[Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast]] was created on 12 January 1922. It was split into [[Karachay Autonomous Oblast]] and [[Cherkess National Okrug]] on 26 April 1926. The Cherkess National District was elevated to an autonomous oblast status on 30 April 1928.  This [[Cherkess Autonomous Oblast]] existed until 9 January 1957, when it was incorporated into the Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast in its former borders following the rehabilitation of the [[Karachay]] (whom Stalin had had deported to Central Asia in 1943).

On 3 July 1991, the autonomous oblast was elevated to the status of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia (under the jurisdiction of the [[Russian SFSR]]).  With the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in December 1991, the various peoples of Karachay-Cherkessia proclaimed their own polities including, on 27 October 1991, the Cherkessia Republic.  Russia was prepared to accept division of the territory, but a 28 March 1992 referendum saw a majority of the population vote against separation, and on 9 December 1992, the words "Autonomous Soviet Socialist" was dropped from the name and it became the [[Karachay-Cherkess Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;

'''Chipaya''' is a native South American language of the [[Uru–Chipaya]] language family.  The only other language in the grouping, [[Uru language|Uru]], is considered by some to be a divergent dialect of Chipaya. [[Ethnologue]] lists the language vitality as "vigorous," with 1200 speakers out of an ethnic population of around 1800.  Chipaya has been influenced considerably by [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], and more recently, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], with a third of its vocabulary having been replaced by those languages. 

The Chipayan language is spoken in the area south of [[Lake Titicaca]] along the [[Desaguadero River (Bolivia)|Desaguadero River]] in the mountains of [[Bolivia]] and mainly in the town of [[Chipaya]] located in the [[Sabaya Province]] of the Bolivian department of [[Oruro Department|Oruro]] north of [[Lago Coipasa|Coipasa Salt Flats]].  Native speakers generally refer to it as ''Puquina'' or ''Uchun Maa Taqu'' ("our mother language"), but is not the same as the extinct [[Puquina language]]. Chipaya is an [[agglutinative language]], though it has features uncommon to most agglutinative languages, according to preliminary research by the organization [[DOBES]].

'''Christian atheism''' is a form of [[cultural Christian]]ity and ethics system drawing its beliefs and practices from [[Jesus]]' life and teachings as recorded in the [[New Testament]] [[Gospels]] and other sources, whilst rejecting [[supernatural]] claims of [[Christianity]].

Christian atheism takes many forms: some Christian atheists take a [[Theology|theological]] position in which the belief in the transcendent or interventionist [[God in Christianity|God]] is rejected or absent in favor of finding God totally in the world ([[Thomas J. J. Altizer]]) while others follow [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] in a godless world ([[William Hamilton (theologian)|William Hamilton]]). Hamilton's Christian atheism is similar to [[Jesuism]].

== Beliefs ==
[[File:2005-11-20 - United Kingdom - England - London - Hyde Park - Speakers' Corner 4887898959.jpg|thumb|A man promoting Christian atheism at [[Speakers' Corner]], London, in 2005. One of his placards reads: "To follow Jesus, reject God".]]
Thomas Ogletree, Frederick Marquand Professor of Ethics and Religious Studies at [[Yale Divinity School]], lists these four common beliefs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ogletree|first=Thomas|title=professor at Yale University|url=http://religiousstudies.yale.edu/people/thomas-ogletree|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogletree"&gt;Ogletree, Thomas W. The Death of God Controversy. New York: Abingdon Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The assertion of the unreality of God for our age, including the understandings of God which have been a part of traditional Christian [[theology]].
# The insistence upon coming to grips with contemporary [[culture]] as a necessary feature of responsible theological work.
# Varying degrees and forms of alienation from the church as it is now constituted.
# Recognition of the centrality of the person of [[Jesus]] in theological reflection.

== God's existence ==
According to [[Paul van Buren]], a [[Death of God theology|Death of God theologian]], the word God itself is "either meaningless or misleading".&lt;ref name="Ogletree" /&gt; Van Buren contends that it is impossible to think about God and says: &lt;blockquote&gt; We cannot identify anything which will count for or against the truth of our statements concerning 'God'.&lt;ref name="Ogletree" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The inference from these claims to the "either meaningless or misleading" conclusion is implicitly premised on the [[Verificationism|verificationist theory of meaning]].

Most Christian atheists believe that God never existed, but there are a few who believe in the death of God literally.&lt;ref name="Lyas"&gt;Lyas, Colin. "On the Coherence of Christian Atheism." ''The Journal of the Royal Institute of Philosophy'' 45(171): 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas J. J. Altizer]] is a well-known Christian atheist who is known for his literal approach to the death of God. He often speaks of God's death as a redemptive event. In his book ''The Gospel of Christian Atheism'', he says: &lt;blockquote&gt;Every man today who is open to experience knows that God is absent, but only the Christian knows that God is dead, that the death of God is a final and irrevocable event and that God's death has actualized in our history a new and liberated humanity.&lt;ref name="Gospel"&gt;Altizer, Thomas J. J. ''The Gospel of Christian Atheism''. Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Dealing with culture ==
Theologians including Altizer and Lyas looked at the scientific, empirical culture of today and tried to find religion's place in it. In Altizer's words: &lt;blockquote&gt;No longer can faith and the world exist in mutual isolation…the radical Christian condemns all forms of faith that are disengaged with the world.&lt;ref name="Gospel" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; He goes on to say that our response to atheism should be one of "acceptance and affirmation".&lt;ref name="Gospel" /&gt; Colin Lyas, a Philosophy lecturer at [[Lancaster University]], stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;Christian atheists are united also in the belief that any satisfactory answer to these problems must be an answer that will make life tolerable in this world, here and now and which will direct attention to the social and other problems of this life.&lt;ref name="Lyas" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Separation from the church ==
Thomas Altizer has said: &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he radical Christian believes that the [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] tradition has ceased to be Christian.&lt;ref name="Gospel" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Altizer believed that orthodox Christianity no longer had any meaning to people because it did not discuss Christianity within the context of contemporary theology. Christian atheists want to be completely separated from most orthodox Christian beliefs and biblical traditions.&lt;ref name="Ham"&gt;Altizer, Thomas J. J. and William Hamilton. ''Radical Theology and The Death of God''. New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.,1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Altizer states that a faith will not be completely pure if it is open to modern culture. This faith "can never identify itself with an ecclesiastical tradition or with a given doctrinal or ritual form". He goes on to say that faith cannot "have any final assurance as to what it means to be a Christian".&lt;ref name="Gospel" /&gt; Altizer said: "We must not, he says, seek for the sacred by saying 'no' to the radical profanity of our age, but by saying 'yes' to it".&lt;ref name="Ham" /&gt; They see religions which withdraw from the world as moving away from truth. This is part of the reason why they see the existence of God as counter-progressive. Altizer wrote of God as the enemy to man because mankind could never reach its fullest potential while God existed.&lt;ref name="Gospel" /&gt; He went on to state that "to cling to the Christian God in our time is to evade the human situation of our century and to renounce the inevitable suffering which is its lot".&lt;ref name="Gospel" /&gt;

Although Jesus is still a central feature of Christian atheism, Hamilton said that to the Christian atheist, Jesus as an historical or supernatural figure is not the foundation of faith; instead, Jesus is a "place to be, a standpoint".&lt;ref name="Ham" /&gt; Christian atheists look to Jesus as an example of what a Christian should be, but they do not see him as God, nor as the [[Son of God]]; merely as an influential [[rabbi]].

Hamilton wrote that following Jesus means being "alongside the neighbor, being for him"&lt;ref name="Ham" /&gt; and that to follow Jesus means to be human, to help other humans, and to further humankind.

Other Christian atheists such as [[Thomas Altizer]] preserve the divinity of Jesus, arguing that through him God negates God's transcendence of being.

==By denomination==
===Protestantism===
In the Netherlands, 42% of the members of the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]] (PKN) are [[Nontheism|nontheists]].&lt;ref name="Nederland' 2006"&gt;God in Nederland' (1996–2006), by Ronald Meester, G. Dekker, {{ISBN|9789025957407}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-belief among clergymen is not always perceived as a problem. Some follow the tradition of "Christian non-realism", most famously expounded in the United Kingdom by [[Don Cupitt]] in the 1980s, which holds that God is a symbol or metaphor and that religious language is not matched by a transcendent reality. According to an investigation of 860 pastors in seven Dutch Protestant denominations, 1 in 6 clergy are either agnostic or atheist. In one of those denominations, the Remonstrant Brotherhood, the number of doubters was 42 percent.&lt;ref name=PKN-Hendrikse&gt;{{cite news|last=Pigott|first=Robert|title=Dutch rethink Christianity for a doubtful world|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14417362|accessdate=2 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/2009/03/31/does-your-pastor-believe-in-god-2/|title=Does Your Pastor Believe in God?|work=albertmohler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minister of the PKN, [[Klaas Hendrikse]] has described God as "a word for experience, or human experience" and said that Jesus may have [[Christ myth theory|never existed]]. Hendrikse gained attention with his book published in November 2007 in which he said that it was not necessary to believe in God's existence in order to believe in God. The Dutch title of the book translates as ''Believing in a God Who Does Not Exist: Manifesto of An Atheist Pastor''. Hendrikse writes in the book that "God is for me not a being but a word for what can happen between people. Someone says to you, for example, 'I will not abandon you', and then makes those words come true. It would be perfectly alright to call that [relationship] God". A General Synod found Hendrikse's views were widely shared among both clergy and church members. The February 3, 2010 decision to allow Hendrikse to continue working as a pastor followed the advice of a regional supervisory panel that the statements by Hendrikse "are not of sufficient weight to damage the foundations of the Church. The ideas of Hendrikse are theologically not new, and are in keeping with the liberal tradition that is an integral part of our church", the special panel concluded.&lt;ref name="PKN-Hendrikse" /&gt;

A [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris Interactive]] survey from 2003 found that 90% of self-identified [[Protestantism|Protestants]] in the [[United States]] believe in God and about 4% of American Protestants believe there is no God.&lt;ref name=Harris2003&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|author=Humphrey Taylor|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf|title=While Most Americans Believe in God, Only 36% Attend a Religious Service Once a Month or More Often|work=The Harris Poll #59|date=October 15, 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206042041/http://www.harrisinteractive.com/vault/Harris-Interactive-Poll-Research-While-Most-Americans-Believe-in-God-Only-36-pct-A-2003-10.pdf|archivedate=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism===
Catholic atheism is a [[belief]] in which the culture, traditions, rituals and norms of [[Catholicism]] are accepted, but the existence of God is rejected. It is illustrated in [[Miguel de Unamuno]]'s novel ''[[San Manuel Bueno, Mártir]]'' (1930). According to research in 2007, only 27% of Catholics in the Netherlands considered themselves [[theist]] while 55% were [[ietsism|ietsist]] or [[deism|agnostic deist]] and 17% were [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]]. Many Dutch people still affiliate with the term "Catholic" and use it within certain traditions as a basis of their cultural identity, rather than as a religious identity. The vast majority of the Catholic population in the Netherlands is now largely irreligious in practice.&lt;ref name="Nederland' 2006" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', the [[apologist]] [[C. S. Lewis]] objected to Hamilton's version of Christian atheism and the claim that Jesus was merely a moral guide:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. [...] Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lewis's argument, now known as [[Lewis's trilemma]], has been criticized for, among other things, constituting a [[false trilemma]]{{How?|date=October 2018}}. Philosopher John Beversluis argues that Lewis "deprives his readers of numerous alternate interpretations of Jesus that carry with them no such odious implications".&lt;ref&gt;John Beversluis, ''C.S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1985), p 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and its allies played an important role in the [[American labor movement|United States]] [[labor movement]], particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, but never succeeded, with rare exceptions, either in bringing the labor movement around to its agenda of fighting for [[socialism]] and full [[workers' self-management|workers' control]] over [[industry]], or in converting their influence in any particular union into membership gains for the Party. The CP has had only negligible influence in labor since its supporters' defeat in internal union political battles in the aftermath of World War II and the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]'s expulsion of the unions in which they held the most influence in 1950. After the expulsion of the Communists, organized labor in the United States began a steady decline.
{{American socialism |History}}
Historians disagree why the union movement never formed a labor party and why American workers have never embraced socialist parties in any numbers in the last ninety years. Some{{Who|date=December 2009}} have argued that a strain of [[American exceptionalism]] made U.S. workers resistant to parties that emphasized [[class struggle]]; others{{Who|date=December 2009}} have attributed the left's failure to its own successes in building strong unions, but at the cost of downplaying its own political and social agendas for the sake of unity or short-term gains. Others{{Who|date=December 2009}} take just the opposite position: that the left lost its power to lead the labor movement by its ideological zig-zags. The CP's history within the labor movement can support all of these theses.

==The CPUSA's founding and early years==
{{Main|Communist Party USA}}
The Communist Party of the USA was founded in 1919, out of two groups who broke from the [[Socialist Party of America]] when it refused to join the [[Comintern]]. The original core of the CP believed that the triumph of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in [[Russia]] meant that the revolution was at hand in the West as well.

The CP's initial attitude towards unions reflected that [[millenarianism|millenarian]] view. At the time of its founding, according to a leader of the party, "it would have been difficult to gather a half dozen delegates who knew anything about the trade union movement." The Party also became a largely clandestine organization during the immediate post-war years, as the [[Palmer Raids]] led to the arrest and deportation of thousands of Party members.

The CP at that time looked on the [[American Federation of Labor]] as an enemy to be destroyed in order to eliminate the temptations of reformism rather than revolution. They also looked down on most trade union activities as insufficiently revolutionary: even though the labor movement was engaged in a great wave of strikes in 1919, including a [[general strike]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the Party's members had no role in them. Instead they urged workers to put aside their short-term economic goals and to concentrate on overthrowing the state.

The [[Profintern]], or "Red International of Labor Unions," forced the CP to change in 1921, when it directed U.S. communists to work within the AFL in order to make it a revolutionary body – what an earlier generation of SP members referred to as "[[boring from within]]." In order to accomplish this, the Profintern recognized the [[Trade Union Educational League]], an organization founded by [[William Z. Foster]], as its U.S. affiliate.

Foster had been, prior to his agreement to bring the TUEL under the wing of the CP, a syndicalist, who believed that workers would seize power through workers' organizations, such as unions, rather than through political organizations, such as a communist party. He had led the AFL's failed 1919 strike in the steel industry and had established particularly close relations then with [[John Fitzpatrick (unionist)|John Fitzpatrick]], the President of the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]].

TUEL functioned within existing unions, trying to organize support for [[industrial unionism]], a [[Farmer-Labor Party|labor party]], organizing the unorganized and the [[Soviet Union]]. TUEL strove to create alliances with leaders who shared some of its agenda, while trying to build a base for left unionism at the local level.

After some organizational successes, however, TUEL managed to alienate Fitzpatrick, leaving them without major allies when the AFL denounced TUEL as a "[[dual unionism|dual union]]" and expelled TUEL members in 1924. The CPUSA lost more allies when, under orders from the Comintern, it withdrew its previous enthusiastic support for the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] candidacy of [[Robert La Follette, Sr.]] for President in 1924.

The CP, on the other hand, had some short-lived successes in the labor movement without the TUEL's help. The CP had broad support in the early 1920s among the radical, largely immigrant, [[garment workers]] in New York City. A number of CP members won leadership positions in three major [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU) locals in New York City in 1924 and offices in other locals in [[Boston]], [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]]. They held on to those offices despite the attempts by the Socialist leadership of the ILGWU to oust them.

But in 1926 the left leadership in New York forfeited everything they had when they lost a strike of 40,000 cloakmakers. The local union leadership lost the strike in large part because of the internal factionalism within the CP: when the union had the opportunity to settle on terms that were less than what the union had demanded, the union's leaders went to the CP for approval of the deal. But the Party's fraction within the union was reluctant to accept it, afraid that this would open them up to charges of softness in intra-Party factional warfare. The strike dragged on another few months, at which point the locals accepted an inferior agreement.

That gave the International union the opportunity it needed: the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] leadership of the ILGWU took over the exhausted locals after they settled and their supporters were too dispirited to resist. While the CP retained a strong base of support in the smaller [[Fur Workers Union]], it never recovered from its defeat in the much larger garment industry; on the contrary, the ILGWU, led by [[David Dubinsky]] for the next forty years, remained resolutely anti-communist thereafter.

The TUEL itself changed for brief period into the dual union that the AFL had accused it of being. The TUEL led a [[1926 Passaic Textile Strike|strike of woolen industry workers]] in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] in 1926 — until, that is, the [[Comintern]] instructed the Party later that year to abandon any [[independent unions]] it had formed on the ground that these represented [[ultra-left]] adventurism. The strike, which would probably have been lost in any case, ended six months later in defeat after the AFL's [[United Textile Workers]] took over leadership of the strike.

==The CPUSA turns left: the Trade Union Unity League==
The Comintern's repudiation of dual unionism in 1926 turned out, however, to be only a temporary change in policy; in 1928 the CP began establishing new CP-led unions in the coal, textile, food and garment industries and renamed the TUEL the Trade Union Unity League in 1929. This change in policy coincided with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s turn to the left as he moved against his former ally [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. CP leaders, such as Foster, willing to make the switch, held on to their positions in the Party, while those who did not, such as [[Jay Lovestone]], were expelled.

The CP's [[Third Period]] stance towards unions was nearly as [[ultra-left]] as its position in 1919 through 1921. While advocating a "united front from below," the Party attacked other socialist parties as "[[social fascists]]" and denounced the AFL as "an organ to suppress and disorganize the masses" which workers should join only to "overthrow the [[reformist]] [[bureaucracy]]" that ran them. The CP instead focused on founding new revolutionary unions in the expectation that the collapse of capitalism was just around the corner.

These new dual unions were, in fact, often more like ginger groups than unions, with few members and even fewer long-term members. Nonetheless these groups did make some heroic efforts to organize the unorganized. In 1929 the [[National Textile Workers]] led a strike of thousands of textile workers in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], who walked out, despite the NTW's attempts to hold them back, after management fired five union activists. That strike was crushed after mobs of citizens smashed up union offices and murdered a union activist.

While local authorities, preachers and newspapers played up the National Textile Workers' association with godless communism and its opposition to [[white supremacy]], it is unlikely that this made much difference in the final analysis. The authorities reacted just as violently when the much less radical AFL intervened after a spontaneous strike of textile workers erupted in other mill towns several months later. That strike likewise ended in mass arrests and the killing of three strikers, shot in the back by [[sheriffs]].

===Miners' unions===
The CP's efforts in mining were just as unsuccessful. The CP had once had a good deal of support in the internecine struggles within the [[United Mine Workers]] in the 1920s, when [[John L. Lewis]] used every weapon available to defeat his rivals for union leadership while wages and working conditions in the industry grew worse. The TUEL-supported candidate who ran for UMW President against Lewis in the 1924 election was credited with 66,000 votes in the official tally – nearly half what Lewis received. The CP later allied itself, for a time, with [[John Brophy (labor)|John Brophy]], whose "Save the Union" slate probably would have won election to national leadership in 1926 if the vote had been held democratically.

Lewis, however, effectively drove all of the TUEL and Brophy supporters from the union after his victory in 1926. The CP later burned its bridges with Brophy, denouncing him as a reformist.

The CP founded its own [[National Miners Union]] in 1928. It engaged in a fierce struggle to undo wage cuts when miners struck in Pennsylvania and Ohio mines in 1931, but lost the strike when mine operators chose to recognize the UMW – which had not been involved in the strike – rather than the NMU, then obtained an injunction to prevent the NMU from picketing.

The NMU also took on the leadership of a strike that the UMW had called in [[Harlan County, Kentucky]] in 1931 with even more disastrous results, since the union was not prepared to provide the relief necessary to permit strikers to remain out for any length of time, particularly in the face of attacks by "gun thugs." The NMU's strong opposition to racial discrimination and wholehearted support for the Soviet Union also served to alienate it from the mostly [[fundamentalist]] and predominantly white miners in Harlan County. While the strike publicized the horrific conditions in one of the most isolated parts of [[Appalachia]], it did not produce any concrete benefits for striking miners.

There were, however, some bright spots for the CP: their [[Food Workers Industrial Union]] successfully organized cafeteria and restaurant workers, particularly in New York, where many of the restaurant workers unions had been taken over by [[Dutch Schultz]] as part of his labor rackets. Those CP-led unions not only fended off Schultz's gangsters, but thrived, and became dominant within the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] [[Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees]] union in New York when they affiliated with it several years later.

The [[Maritime Workers Industrial Union]] did not survive the Third Period, but it left its mark. Sailors and [[longshoremen]] had a tradition of radical politics and more or less spontaneous job actions; the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] had been particularly active in both east and west coast ports up through the 1920s. The MWIU organized occasional strikes, attacked the inadequate relief provided for unemployed workers by the YMCA and other groups, and distributed the MWIU's newspapers.These programs attracted a number of sailors and longshoremen, including [[Harry Bridges]], who subsequently led the west coast longshore strike of 1934.

The TUUL had similar limited success in the automobile industry, where it established shop nuclei that linked the Party with the campaign for industrial unionism. The CP was, however, more successful in organizing unemployed workers in Detroit and other auto centers than it was in recruiting or organizing auto workers.

==The early years of the New Deal and the founding of the CIO==
The CP initially looked on the [[New Deal]] and the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration as a form of fascism, because the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] provided for a form of [[corporativist]] rule, calling on industries to negotiate codes that would regulate prices, production, labor relations and other matters with only indirect government supervision. The government panels created under the NRA generally gave in to employer demands and appeared to be more concerned with preventing strikes than with protecting workers' rights or living standards.

Workers flocked to unions for representation, often in advance of any union organizing efforts, in the belief that Roosevelt and the NRA would protect them. Lewis and the UMWA capitalized on this sentiment in 1933 when his organizers told miners that "The President wants you to join the Union." While the UMWA organizers may have meant President Lewis, they did not correct the misimpression on the part of many miners who thought they meant President Roosevelt.

Workers engaged in a wave of strikes, the most since 1921, in 1934. The largest and most significant were three giant strikes for union recognition among longshoremen on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], truck drivers in [[Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934|Minneapolis, Minnesota]] and automobile workers in [[Toledo General Strike of 1934|Toledo, Ohio]]. In each case the strike became either a [[general strike]] or something close to it.

In each case radicals, either associated with the CPUSA or other leftwing parties, played key leadership roles; the CP and its allies, such as Harry Bridges, played an important role in the [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike|west coast longshore strike]]. The CP's influence depended, however, on the personal charisma of Harry Bridges and the hard work put in by its members and sympathizers on the docks, rather than on the MWIU itself, which largely disappeared when its radical cadres followed the membership into the newly revived west coast locals of the ILA. While Bridges was apparently never a member of the CP — something the government tried to prove, without success, in four different trials over more than a decade — he worked closely with Party activists and helped advance their careers within the union, while the union that grew out of the strike, the [[International Longshore and Warehouse Union|International Longshoremen and Warehousemen Union]], espoused the party's politics for decades.

The Party's role in the founding of the [[Transport Workers Union of America]] was even clearer: two TUUL organizers, [[John Santo]] and [[Austin Hogan]], were instrumental in the founding of the union in 1934, and almost all of its original leaders, including [[Mike Quill]], were either Party members or close followers of Party policies. The TWU won the right to represent New York City's public transit workers after several years of clandestine organizing, a series of small strikes, a [[sitdown strike]] in the [[Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]]'s Kent Avenue powerhouse in 1937 and an overwhelming victory among [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]] employees in an [[National Labor Relations Board|NLRB]] election several months later.

Yet while the CP played a leading role in that organization, Party members, even those whose party membership had been open in the past, chose to downplay or conceal their membership. Hogan, a CP candidate for [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1934, kept his party affiliation private, to the extent that was possible, after he became President of TWU Local 100, the local of New York City subway workers. The party discontinued its shop papers, which went by names such as "Red Dynamo" and "Red Express", in 1935, when TWU organizers claimed that the party's overt role in the union was interfering with their efforts and when [[Popular Front]] alliance-building replaced Third Period separatism. While the party remained influential — some said dominant — in the union until 1949, and the union closely followed party policies on issues such as [[American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954)|civil rights]], public ownership of the subways and fare increases, the party took no credit for its contributions and party members vigorously rejected claims of employers, intra-union opponents and investigators that the party was, in fact, a major influence in the union.

===CIO===
The CP similarly gained influence at first in the newly formed [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]], or CIO, on the strength of individual members' work. [[Lee Pressman]], the General Counsel for the CIO and later the [[United Steelworkers of America]], was a member of the CP and the underground [[Harold Ware|Ware group]] involved in espionage for the [[Soviet Union]]. The first publicity director for the CIO, [[Len De Caux]], was likewise a member of the CP throughout his years with the CIO as were many more organizers and rank-and-file activists within the unions affiliated with the CIO.

Individuals like Pressman and De Caux would not have considered working for the CIO if the CP had not shifted its position from sectarian purity to first a [[united front]] and later a [[popular front]] policy that favored alliances with other "progressive forces." At the same time the New Deal was turning to the left, in response to both the increasingly hostile response by employers and the wave of worker discontent that had replaced the apathetic resignation of the first years of the [[Great Depression]]. The CP, having denounced Roosevelt as a fascist only a few years earlier, moved closer and closer to embracing him.

At the same time the CIO and other progressive organizations and individuals overcome many of their reservations about working with the CP. Of the two hundred or so organizers that Lewis hired for the [[Steel Workers Organizing Committee]], sixty were CP members, with particular strength among the staff responsible for organizing foreign-born and African-American workers and in the Chicago area.

Lewis was not particularly concerned with the political beliefs of his organizers, so long as he controlled the organization. As he once famously remarked, "I do not turn my organizers or CIO members upside down and shake them to see what kind of literature falls out of their pockets." He took the same line in private, when David Dubinsky of the ILGWU asked him about the communists on the SWOC staff; as he told Dubinsky, "Who gets the bird? The hunter or the dog?"

==Organizing basic industry==
The CP did not gain influence solely through seeking staff positions, however. In the rubber workers' strike in [[Akron, Ohio]] that represented the first test of the CIO's ability to turn mass discontent into union gains, a number of rank-and-file leaders were also CP members. The Party had a degree of presence, both at the local and international level, in the [[United Rubber Workers]] union formed after the strike.

The CP also exerted a great deal of influence within the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]] (or UE), founded in 1936 by the merger of a number of [[federal union]]s created by the AFL and small shop caucuses, largely made up of CP activists and other socialists and radicals, at [[General Electric]], [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] and other unorganized companies. The CP grew even more powerful within the UE in 1937 when James Matles, former head of the CP's [[Metal Workers Industrial Union]], brought in a number of locals after a brief affiliation with the [[International Association of Machinists]]. Matles and other CP members and allies held the bulk of the important positions within the UE for the next twelve years, until the CIO engineered a split within it in order to separate the Communist leaders from the CIO; they continued to hold power thereafter within that portion of the union that was not raided by the [[International Union of Electrical Workers]].

===United Auto Workers===
The CP achieved even greater results, but less long-term success, working within the [[United Automobile Workers]]. Like the UE, the UAW was also formed in 1936 out of a number of [[federal union]]s created by the AFL and locals from other unions in the industry. Of its 25,000 workers, almost all came from outside Michigan.

One of the most prominent UAW activists in the early years of the union was [[Wyndham Mortimer]], who had led a strike against [[White Motors]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Mortimer was elected Vice-President at the UAW's first convention and might have been elected President if not for concern about his Party membership.

Mortimer and the CP formed alliances at that first convention with [[George Addes]], then the [[secretary-treasurer]] of the UAW, later its President, and [[Walter Reuther]], who headed the UAW from 1947 until his death in 1970. The CP maintained its alliance with Addes, the center of the left-wing caucus within the UAW, for the next decade. Its alliance with Reuther proved much shorter.

When the UAW decided to organize the industry by going after [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], Mortimer was sent to [[Flint, Michigan]], where GM's production was centered. Even at that early stage factional infighting within the UAW, in particular between Mortimer and [[Homer Martin (labor leader)|Homer Martin]], the first President of the UAW, threatened to derail the campaign. When Martin pulled Mortimer out of Flint, Mortimer arranged for [[Bob Travis (activist)|Bob Travis]], another union activist and CP member from Toledo, to replace him.

Travis played an active role in the [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]], aided by some veteran CP autoworkers inside Fisher Body Plant #1 – but also by other radical workers, some belonging to Trotskyist parties, the Socialist Party or the IWW. The same pattern applied outside the plants: Socialist Party members, such as Walter Reuther's brothers [[Victor Reuther]] and [[Roy Reuther]], and the Socialists and ex-Socialists working for the CIO cooperated with CP members, such as Henry Kraus, the UAW's publicity director, with a minimum of [[sectarian]] bickering.

The CP, in fact, played down its revolutionary politics during the sit-down strike. In part this was to avoid giving GM and its allies an issue to use against the strike; in part it was out of fear of distancing the Party from the strikers, who were, in the opinion of CP leadership, using revolutionary means to achieve traditional union goals. The Socialists, by contrast, had a much smaller base within the striking workers, but were much more inclined to attach revolutionary significance to the sit-down strikes and to magnify their own role in them.

===Steelworkers===
The CP was even more circumspect in the Steel Workers Organizing Committee. The CP was anxious not to scare off its partners and employers in the CIO: its members therefore made no effort to advertise their Party affiliation and even took steps not to pack SWOC conventions.

Nor did circumstances give them much opportunity to rise to leadership. Unlike the UAW, which was born out of tumultuous struggles in which CP activists and other radicals played leading parts, the SWOC conducted a much more top-down organizing campaign subject to close control. SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP played an important role in recruiting and organizing members, but rarely stayed in one area long enough to cultivate the sort of relations with local leaders that might have allowed them to recruit them into the Party, if they had tried to do so. They simply did not have the freedom of action that Mortimer, Travis and others within the UAW did.

Nor did they have the same power. As staff members, Pressman, de Caux and the SWOC organizers who belonged to the CP had, at most, only indirect influence on CIO or SWOC policy and no independent base to rally support or propagandize for other issues. [[Philip Murray]], a former UMWA associate whom Lewis installed as head of the SWOC, weeded out most of the Communists from the union over the years after the initial organizing drives as the SWOC became the United Steelworkers of America. By 1942 the purge was almost complete.

The '''Dhanuk''' are an ethnic group found in [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. In India, the Dhanuk are found in the states of [[Haryana]], Uttar Pradesh and [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das page 433&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, they are settled in the [[Terai]] districts of [[Saptari]], [[Siraha]] and [[Dhanusa District|Dhanusa]].  They are either [[Kshetris]] or a minority indigenous people. The Dhanuks of eastern Terai are also known as [[Mandal]]. The Dhanuk is also known as Jaswal Kurmi.{{cn|date=December 2016}} The Dhanuk in both countries are [[Hindu]], and speak various dialects of [[Hindi language|Hindi]], such as [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] and [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]].

== In India ==
According to tradition, the Dhanuk community gets its name from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''dhanushka'', meaning a bowman.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The Dhanuk (Dhanak) are strictly [[endogamy|endogamous]], and practice clan [[exogamy]]. Their main clans are the Dhankar, Dholbaja, Katheriya, Khakarpuria, Laungvasta, and Supabandha. All these sub-groups are not of equal status, and there is hierarchy on the basis of their respective occupations. A small number of the Dhanuk are a now petty landowners. Because of their switching to petty works for livelihood they are treated as Dalits. As a [[Dalit]] community, they face social discrimination whose settlements are found at the edge of villages.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 432 to 437&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dhanuk speak various dialects of [[Hindi language|Hindi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Uttar Pradesh Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 432 to 437&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Dhanuk of Haryana ===

The Dhanak of [[Haryana]] are a community of weavers, also known as Kabirpanthi Pandit. They have been granted [[Scheduled Caste]] status, and are found throughout the state. They now speak [[Haryanvi language|Haryana]], and are said to have immigrated from [[Awadh]]. The community consists of a number of clans, and practices clan exogamy. Their main clans include the Duggal , Nugaria (Nagoria), Ninania, Khatak, Pacherwal, Kerar, Katheria, Mundadiya, Ladwal, Morwal, Mahore, Rangbhaa, Bagadi, Suralia,Frand, Solia (Solanki), Bharor, Atkan, Gorraiya, Bumra, Siyan, Kataria and Indora. The Dhanak are a landless community, with many employed in their traditional occupation of weaving. Most live in multi-caste villages, occupying their own distinct quarters. Each settlement contains a traditional caste council known as a ''biradari panchayat''. This acts as an instrument of social control, as well as acting as an informal welfare association.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Haryana Volume XXIII edited by M.L Sharma and A.K Bhatia pages 142 to 148 Manohar&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Nepal ==
Different types/groups of Dhanuk live in Nepal. They are settled all over the country from Eastern Terai to Western hills. Among them, the Dhanuks of hilly region in [[Far-Western Development Region, Nepal|Far-Western]] are considered as a [[Chhetri|Kshetris]], who were believed to have originated from Bhatt Brahmin of Doti Rajya, Ugratara temple. One brother of Brahman was believed to have been given titled Kshetri by Kalu Shahi the king of Doti Rajya at that time as he protected the king from Muslims who attacked the Doti kingdom. It is also believed that that Brahmin used his tantrik knowledge and bravery to protect his religion and kingdom. These people have a history of about 200 years being called Dhanuk. The people of this group follow the rituals like other Kshetris of that area.

There are Dhanuk called mandal or Rajvansi living in the Eastern part of Nepal. They are also mainly Hindu but perform different rituals. The rites of birth, death and marriage are performed by giving due importance like other tribes. The pregnant woman is kept in a separate home to arrange assistance from a dagrin (midwife) of the same caste. The baby is caused to cry as soon as it is born. The ghosts are driven away by putting the branches of [[jujube]] and discarded shoes in the main gate of the house. The baby is given the milk of a she-goat to drink. [[Chhaiti]] is done in six days and [[Barahi]] in twelve days. In Barahi, worships and festivities are arranged.

Dhanuks do not marry within the clan nor do they have the practice of cross-cousin marriage. In most of the cases, the parents seek the girl or the boy. Due to the influence of neighbours they also have the system of [[dowry]].

When a Dhanuk dies, the corpse is cremated if the deceased is above 12 years of age and is buried if her or she is below 12 years.

The houses of Dhanuks are plastered with mud and pictures are drawn of mud too. Women go outside for work but a male member remains the head of the family. Lots of feasts are organised on various occasions. Some Dhanuks never drink spirit and [[jaand]] but Dhanuks in general have the practice of drinking [[raksi]] or spirit.

The houses of Dhanuks are built in clusters in the river basins and edges of forests. They like to settle in river basins. A group of ten or eleven households makes a [[bindar]] committee and five bindars constitute a [[praganna]]. The chief of a praganna is called ''maijan''. There is one post, called ''chaurasi'', above him. These institutions manage tribal reconciliation and settlement of disputes. Those who do not abide by rules are expelled from the ethnic group. [[Mandal (clan)|Mandal]] is their thars (clans).

Since they dwell in the river basins and the edges of forests, their main occupations are fishing and animal husbandry. Some of the Dhanuks are big landowners, but the Dhanuks who belong to the group of minority nationality are absolutely landless. They earn their livelihood by working as agricultural labourers and household servants.

==Beliefs==
In some places [[Brahmin]]s are appointed as priests while in other places they use Dhanuk priests. The Dhanuk caste believes in magic, witchcraft and ghosts. They are divided into two religious groups: those who worship [[Kali]] are called Kaliyaha and others are called [[Maharkhiya]]. Those who worship Kali eat meat and drink spirit or wine, whereas Maharkhiyas do not do so. They worship a goddess called [[Gahil]], who is one of five sisters. The other goddesses are [[Shitalmata]] and [[Goureya Gaiya]]. The main occupation of Dhanuks is working for big [[zamindar]]s (landowners) and farming.

==Distribution==

The Dhanuks live all across India, [[Nepal]], and [[Bangladesh]]. In Nepal, they are scattered from Morang in the east to the Terai in the west. But the Dhanuk are also found in Saptari, Siraha and Dhanusa in the east. Their main area of settlement stretches from Saptari to Dhanusa in the plain inner valley south of the [[Churia]] hills. It is hard to tell the population of minority nationality of Dhanuks in Nepal. In India, they are found in a wide region stretching from Haryana to [[Bihar]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The [[2011 Census of India]] for Uttar Pradesh showed the Dhanuk classified as a [[Scheduled Caste]] with a population of 651,355.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/SC_ST/PCA-A10/SC-0900-PCA-A-10-ddw.xlsx |title= A-10 Individual Scheduled Caste Primary Census Abstract Data and its Appendix – Uttar Pradesh |publisher=Registrar General &amp; Census Commissioner, India |accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language ==

In Nepal, their language is Maithali. They are influenced by Hindu religion and the Indian culture across the border.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

In India, the Dhanuk of north Bihar speak [[Maithili language|Maithili]], while those of eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] speak [[Awadhi]].
[[Jharkhand]] speak [[Santali language|Santhali]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Personal==
Alfredo Jiménez Mota was born on February 16, 1980, in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, where he continued to reside as a career minded bachelor. He is the only son of Esperanza Mota Martinez and Jose Alfredo Jiménez Hernandez, and the only brother of Leticia, his sister.&lt;ref name=proceso/&gt; Jiménez Mota began his work in the state of Sinaloa upon earning his degree at the [[Universidad de Occidente]] in [[Culiacán]], in Communication.&lt;ref name=nuestraaparenterendicion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuestraaparenterendicion.com/tuyyocoincidimosenlanocheterrible/index.php/component/k2/item/58-jose-alfredo-jimenez-mota#.WhWpLUqnFaQ|title=Tú y yo coincidimos en la noche terrible|language=es|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jiménez family are [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Catholic]] and attended Cristo Rey de [[Empalme, Sonora|Empalme]], where Jiménez Mota sang in the choir. In his early years, Jiménez Mota enjoyed boxing, weighing in at 240-pounds.&lt;ref name=proceso/&gt;&lt;ref name=amazonaws&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kf-site-production.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/pdfs/000/000/013/original/Reporter_Analysis_Impunity_Project_English_lite.pdf|title=Killing News: Stories Go Untold as Latin American Journalists Die|author=Tyler Bridges|publisher=[[Amazon Web Services]]|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
The career of Alfredo Jiménez Mota' began in newspapers while he was still a student in Culiacán, where he worked for ''El Sol de Culiacán'', ''[[El Debate (Mexico)|El Debate]]'' and ''Noroeste'', Sinaloa.&lt;ref name=nuestraaparenterendicion/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldpress/&gt; and began to report in the genre of the [[nota roja]] (tabloid style crime stories).&lt;ref name=nuestraaparenterendicion/&gt; He was also director of [[social communication]] at the Attorney General Office of [[Culiacán]], Sinaloa. In late 2004, Jiménez Mota joined ''El Imparcial'', where he often wrote stories dangerous enough that editors did not want to print his byline but Jiménez Mota insisted on the credit. He disappeared five months into his employment.&lt;ref name=proceso&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/400139/recuerdan-al-periodista-alfredo-jimenez-desaparecido-hace-10-anos-en-sonora|author=Milton Martínez|title=Recuerdan al periodista Alfredo Jiménez desaparecido hace 10 años en Sonora|date=April 2, 2015|publisher=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]]|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;Prior to his disappearance, Jiménez Mota was investigating the government's involvement in drug trafficking in the region of Sinaloa and possible involvement with the [[Beltrán-Leyva Cartel|Beltrán Leyva]] and [[Sinaloa Cartel|Sinaloa]] cartels, the latter involving drug lords [[Ismael Zambada García|Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada García]] and [[Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán]]. The [[United States]] [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] was also investigating drug trafficking into the US from this northern border region.&lt;ref name=worldpress/&gt; On April 2, 2005 Jiménez Mota was being followed and photographed, which led to him seeking refuge at Los Grillos, a restaurant at Hilalgo Square, until he could safely make his way back to his office. Prior to this incident he was receiving death threats from an unknown source which led to his vigilance on the job and in his personal life.&lt;ref name=amazonaws/&gt; It was later this same evening when Jiménez Mota disappeared, never to be seen nor heard from again.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45392-2005Apr11.html|title=Spate of Attacks Targets Journalists in Mexico |date=April 30, 2012|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his friends and colleagues, Jiménez Mota failed to show up  for drinks at a restaurant where they planned to speak about their days events. During his investigations, Jiménez Mota caused a stir in the State Attorney General's office by his persistence. He also angered the Police Chief while examining connections between the department and local drug trafficking.  There are conflicting accounts on what happened the evening Jiménez Mota went missing.

==Context==
In an effort to silence reporters, Mexico ranks 11th of all countries, and 1st in Latin countries in cartel-related homicides of journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/12/world/fg-mexpress12|title=Investigative Journalism Proves Life-Threatening in Mexico|author=Chris Kraul|date=April 12, 2005|via=LA Times|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are many suspects in the disappearance of Alfredo Jiménez Mota, the case has never been solved. In November 2005, a suspect Raul Enrique Parra and drug trafficker was brutally murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://borderreporter.com/2007/12/the-border-report-56/|title=Secreto a Voces|author=Michel Marizco|publisher=Border Reporter|date=December 29, 2007|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Jiménez Mota's disappearance marked the first case of missing or murdered journalists in Hermocillo, the capitol of the state of Sonora. Within days of his disappearance the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) and Rapid Response Unit (URR) began to investigate. The IAPA demanded all authorities get involved in an effort to stop the murder of journalists and to support the effort of freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=ifex1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ifex.org/mexico/2006/04/04/report_on_disappeared_journalist/|title=Report on disappeared journalist Alfredo Jiménez Mota inaugurates anti-impunity campaign|publisher=[[IFEX (organization)|IFEX]]|date=April 4, 2006|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was taken to the Deputy Attorney General for Specialized Investigation in Organized Crime (SIEDO) where they vowed the case would be resolved. The IAPA and over 40 newspaper directors met in August 2005 to discuss solutions and build strength in journalism.&lt;ref name=ifex2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ifex.org/mexico/2009/03/13/iapa_presents_investigation_into/|title=IAPA presents investigation into the disappearance of journalist Alfredo Jiménez Mota to the IACHR|publisher=IFEX|date=March 13, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the reporting arm of this group—called the Phoenix Group after a similar investigative project in the United States after [[Don Bolles]] was murdered by the mafia—revealed federal and state officials could be involved in the disappearance of Jiménez Mota, the administrative arm issued the "Declaration of Hermicillo" as a set of concrete steps the state could take to ensure the safety of journalists.&lt;ref name=ifex1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ifex2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.sipiapa.org/notas/1207408-alfredo-jimenez-mota-case-admitted-to-iachr|title=Alfredo Jiménez Mota case admitted to IACHR|publisher=[[Inter American Press Association]]|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsf.org/es/noticias/la-investigacion-sobre-la-desaparicion-de-alfredo-jimenez-mota-esta-atrancada-la-comision-nacional|title="La investigación sobre la desaparición de Alfredo Jiménez Mota está atrancada": La Comisión Nacional de Derechos Humanos interpela a las autoridades federales - Reporteros sin fronteras|website=RSF|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing intimidation of reporters, the IAPA published a map which provided journalists locations of high risk and safety issues.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt;

==Reactions==
The family of Alfredo Jiménez Mota held a memorial on the 10th anniversary of their son's disappearance with memorabilia and activities.&lt;ref name=proceso/&gt; The community of Hermocillo celebrated his memory by attending the unveiling of a plaque which was placed at The Plaza del Tinaco in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-chicharra.com/?p=7014|title=Alfredo Jiménez Mota: casi doce años - La ntry Chicharra|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the Attorney General of Mexico, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] wrote, "The Committee to Protect Journalists would like to express its concern about the fate of Alfredo Jiménez Mota ... We are worried about our colleague's safety. We urge you to conduct a timely and thorough investigation, locate Jiménez, and bring him to safety. CPJ will be monitoring the investigation and respectfully asks that you make available to us any information you might have regarding this case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2005/04/cpj-concerned-about-missing-crime-reporter.php|title=CPJ concerned about missing crime reporter|publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]]|date=April 14, 2005|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colleagues of Jiménez Mota demanded the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) to step up its investigation. The consensus in the media community was those who were possibly involved, were sweeping the case under the rug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2005/04/19/ultima/1113861601_850215.html|title=Reportaje - Los narcos disparan a la prensa|author=Francesc Relea|date=April 19, 2005|work=El Pais}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the disappearance of Jiménez Mota, the fight to "quiet" the press has made reporting difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniradioinforma.com/noticias/sonora/articulo472785.html|title=Mordaza contra la prensa se ha vuelto más brutal: José Alfredo Jiménez|trans-title=Gag against the press has become more brutal: José Alfredo Jiménez|language=es|publisher=UniradioInforma|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Koïchiro Matsuura]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said in a statement that also included Jiménez Mota, "Crimes against journalists and editors constitute a grievous offence against democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34244&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO - Director-General condemns murder of Mexican editor Enrique Perea Quintanilla|publisher=UNESCO Press|date=August 17, 2006|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Mota was posthumously awarded the International Editor Award 2005 for his bravery in journalism.&lt;ref name=worldpress&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/2596.cfm|title=2005-2006 International Editor of the Year Award|publisher=[[World Press Review]]|date=December 11, 2006|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Efik''' are an ethnic group located primarily in southeastern [[Nigeria]], in the southern part of [[Cross River State]]. The Efik speak the [[Efik language]] which is a Benue–Congo language of the [[Cross River language|Cross River family]]. Efik oral histories tell of migration down the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] from [[Arochukwu]] to found numerous settlements in the [[Calabar]] and Creek Town area. Creek Town and its environs are often commonly referred to as  ''Calabar'', and its people as ''Calabar people'', after the European name ''Calabar Kingdom'' given to the state [in present-day [[Cross River State]].  Calabar is not to be confused with the [[Kalabari Kingdom]] in [[Rivers State]] which is an [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] state to its west. Cross River State with [[Akwa Ibom State]] was formerly one of the original twelve states of Nigeria known as the Southeastern State.

The Efik people also occupy southwestern Cameroon including [[Bakassi]].  This area, formerly a trust territory from [[Kamerun|German Cameroon]], was administered as a part of the Eastern Region of Nigeria until it achieved autonomy in 1954, thus separating the Efik people politically.  This separation was further extended when as a result of a [[Southern Cameroons#Trust territory|1961 plebiscite]] the area voted to join the [[Republic of Cameroon]]. Most of the area was immediately transferred, but in August 2006 - Nigeria handed over the Bakassi peninsula to Cameroon.

==Etymology==
The people of [[Uruan]] were said to have given them the name "Efik" deriving from a verb meaning to press or oppress, since they were alleged to be aggressive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==History==
[[Image:Nigeria linguistic 1979.jpg|thumb|Ethno-linguistic groups in Nigeria. Efik-Ibibio in burgundy at bottom.]]
[[Image:Efik USC2000 PHS.svg|thumb|The language spread of '''Efik''' in the [[United States]] according to U.S. Census 2000]]
[[Image:Ekoi skin covered Head dress.JPG|180px|thumb|left|Ekpe [[Ekoi people|Ekoi]] skin covered head dress]]

The Efik people are found in the [[Geopolitical zones in Nigeria|South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria]], in “the South Eastern corner of the Cross River State.”&lt;ref&gt;Cook, T.L. (1985). An integrated phonology of Efik. Ph.D. Thesis. University of Leiden.&lt;/ref&gt; They occupy the basins of the Lower Cross River and down to the Bakassi Peninsula, the Calabar River and down to its tributaries – the Kwa River, Akpayafe (Akpa Ikang) and the Eniong Creek.”&lt;ref&gt;Aye, E. U. (2000). The Efik people. Calabar: Glad Tidings Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They occupied Calabar “towards the end of the seventeenth century or at the beginning of the 18th century.”&lt;ref&gt;Nair, K. K. (1972). Politics and society in South Eastern Nigeria 1841 – 1906: A study of power, diplomacy and commerce in Old Calabar. Evanston: North-Western University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Efik are related to the [[Annang]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], [[Oron people|Oron]], [[Biase]], [[Akamkpa]], [[Uruan]], and [[Eket]]  people.

Although the actual origins of the Efik people are unknown, oral traditions provide accounts of their migration from [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] territory (to the north-west of Calabar) to the present location. The bulk of them left to Uruan in present-day Akwa Ibom State, some to Eniong and surrounding areas. They stayed in Uruan for about a hundred or so years and then moved to Ikpa Ene and Ndodihi briefly before crossing over to their final destination in Creek Town (Esit Edik / Obio Oko). There would seem to be three successive stages in the history of efik migration and settlement: (a) an Igbo phase (b) an Ibibio phase and (c) the drift to the coast.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Although their economy was originally based on fishing, the area quickly developed into a major trading centre and remained so well into the early 1900s. Incoming European goods were traded for slaves, palm oil and other palm products. The Efik kings collected a trading tax called comey from docking ships until the British replaced it with 'comey subsidies'.&lt;ref name="Fubara"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110717042441/http://www.thetidenews.com/article.aspx?qrDate=03%2F05%2F2006&amp;qrTitle=Legendary%20legacies%20of%20Dappa-Biriye&amp;qrColumn=POLITICS Fubara, Dagogo M.J.

Latham (Contributor), David Northrup (Contributor)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Efik were the middle men between the white traders on the coast and the inland tribes of the Cross River and Calabar district. Christian missions were at work among the Efiks beginning in the middle of the 19th century. [[Mary Slessor]], a Presbyterian missionary from Scotland, was concerned with eliminating the tribal superstitious practice of killing twin babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=August 5: Mary Slessor|url=http://www.thisday.pcahistory.org/2017/08/august-5-4/|website=This Day in Presbyterian History|accessdate=5 August 2017|date=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even by 1900, many of the native peoples were well educated in European ideologies and culture, professed Christianity and dressed in European fashion.

A powerful bond of union among the Efik, and one that gives them considerable influence over other tribes, is the secret society known as the [[Ekpe]], the inventor of the [[Nsibidi]], an ancient African Writing.

The Efik and indeed the people of the Old Calabar kingdom were the first to embrace western education in present-day Nigeria, with the establishment of [[Hope Waddel Training Institute]], Calabar in 1895 and the [[Methodist Boys' High School, Oron]]  in 1905.

In 1884 the Efik kings and the chiefs of the Efik placed themselves under British protection. These treaties and attendant territorial economic rights, are documented in CAP 23 of Laws of Eastern Nigeria, captioned 'Comey subsidies law'.&lt;ref name="Fubara"/&gt; The Efik king, also known as the Obong of Calabar, still (as of 2006) is a political power among the Efik.&lt;ref name="Nwagbara"&gt;[http://www.thetidenews.com/article.aspx?qrTitle=Efik%20monarch%20withholds%20blessing%20for%20South-South&amp;qrDate=6/2/2006&amp;qrColumn=NIGER%20DELTA Nwagbara, Friday (2 June 2006) "Efik monarch withholds blessing for South-South" ''The Tide'' Rivers State Newspaper Corp., Port Harcourt, Nigeria];

'''Eritreans in Norway''' are citizens and residents of [[Norway]] who are of [[Eritrea]]n descent.

==Demographics==
According to [[Statistics Norway]], as of 2017, there are a total 19,957 persons of Eritrean origin living in Norway. Of those, 3,661 individuals were born in Norway to immigrant parents.&lt;ref name="Popt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Population by immigrant category and country background|url=https://www.ssb.no/eksport/excel?key=297399|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socioeconomics==
According to Statistics Norway, as of 2014, around 59% of Eritrea-born immigrants have a persistently low income. This was a higher proportion than the native population and many other immigrant groups, largely because most Eritrean individuals arrived as asylum immigrants, who tend to have lower incomes. Persons born in Norway to Eritrean immigrants have a significantly smaller low income percentage of approximately 28%.&lt;ref name="Popinc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Økonomi og levekår for ulike lavinntektsgrupper 2016|pages=57, 117, 118|url=https://www.ssb.no/inntekt-og-forbruk/artikler-og-publikasjoner/_attachment/281093?_ts=157f60210a8|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Statistics Norway, in the 2010-2013 period, the proportion of Eritrea-born perpetrators of criminal offences aged 15 and older in Norway was 79.94 per 1000 residents. When corrected for variables such as age and gender as well as employment, the total decreased to 67.09 after age and gender adjustment and to 52.75 after employment adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kriminalitet blant innvandrere og norskfødte med innvandrerforeldre En analyse av registerdata for perioden 1992-2015|last=Synøve N.

The principal breaches were traffic offences (330 individuals), followed by other offences for profit (60 individuals), public order and integrity violations (51 individuals), violence and maltreatment (39 individuals), drug and alcohol offences (35 individuals), property theft (22 individuals), sexual offences (8 individuals), criminal damage (2 individuals), and other offences (0 individuals).&lt;ref name="Popcjs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Persons sanctioned, by group of principal offence and citizenship (and category of principal offence -2014).

==Education==
According to Statistics Norway, as of 2016, among a total 17,022 Eritrea-born immigrants aged 16 and older, 12,302 individuals had attained a below upper secondary education level, 2,429 had attained an upper secondary education level, 193 had attained a tertiary vocational education level, 1,392 had attained a higher education level of up to four years in duration, 299 had attained a higher education level of more than four years in duration, and 407 had no education.&lt;ref name="Poped"&gt;{{cite web|title=Level of education for immigrants 16 years and older.

==Employment==
According to Statistics Norway, as of 2016, Eritrea-born immigrants aged 15-74 in Norway have an employment rate of approximately 37.9%.&lt;ref name="Popem"&gt;{{cite web|title=Employed immigrants (15-74 years) by country of birth and sex. 4th quarter|url=https://www.ssb.no/eksport/excel?key=302129|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, their unemployment rate was also about 4.5%.&lt;ref name="Popuem"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?MainTable=ForstgenArbNye&amp;KortNavnWeb=innvarbl&amp;PLanguage=1&amp;checked=true|title=Registered unemployed immigrants and persons participating in labour market schemes 15-74 years, by country background, years of residence, sex, contents and time|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Statistics Norway|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Nicolaas Herman Jansen''', (born 24 October 1945 in [[Kamperland]], [[Netherlands]]),&lt;ref name="Geboorteaankondiging"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoeken.krantenbankzeeland.nl/index.php?datering=29-10-1945&amp;krant=vst&amp;q=ernst|title=Profile: geboorteaankondiging|language=Dutch|trans-title=Announcement of birth|date=29 October 1945|work=Vrije stemmen.

==Career==
Ernst Nicolaas Herman Jansen, later known as Ernst Jansen Steur&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3613309/chronologie-zaak-ernst-jansen-steur.html|title=Chronologie zaak Ernst Jansen Steur - NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl|website=Nu.nl|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch former [[neurologist]] who worked in several positions, including the [[Medisch Spectrum Twente]] (MST). During his career he was noted within his profession for his research into [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="DokterBibber"&gt;{{cite news|title='Dokter Bibber', waarom?|author=Jan Colijn|author2=Charles Sanders|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/20502749/___Dokter_Bibber___waarom___.html|newspaper=De Telegraaf|date=20 September 2009|accessdate=13 January 2013|language=Dutch|trans-title='Dr. Shaky, why?' (note: 'Dr. Bibber' is also the Dutch name of the Hasbro game "Operation")}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He completed his [[doctorate|doctoral research]] in 1994 at the [[Maastricht University]], researching Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name="promotieRUL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arno.unimaas.nl/show.cgi?fid=6813|title=Parkinson's Disease – some pharmacotherapeutic aspects|last1=Jansen|first1=Ernst N.H.|date=2 June 1994|work=doctoral thesis|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jansen Steur was interviewed as an expert on the disease by the Dutch television program ''[[EénVandaag]]'' on 24 July 2002 regarding the condition of [[Prince Claus of the Netherlands]] (Jansen Steur indicated on the show that he found the prince's condition "worrisome").&lt;ref name="BeeldenGeluidEenVandaag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zoeken.beeldengeluid.nl/internet/index.aspx?chapterid=1164&amp;filterid=974&amp;contentid=7&amp;verityID=/14140/17349/17290/53797/78444@selectiesl#anchor_item_1 |title=De gezondheidstoestand van Prins Claus|date=24 July 2002|work=EenVandaag, item 1|language=Dutch|trans-title=The state of the health of Prince Claus|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jansen Steur sufferent a serious car accident in Germany&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nrc.nl/handelsblad/van/2015/mei/02/het-brein-van-neuroloog-jansen-was-een-gatenkaas-1494015|title=The brain had holes like Swiss cheese|last=Toonen|first=Anette|date=2 May 2015|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990, resulting in a complex [[hip fracture]]. In 2000 he became addicted to [[Midazolam]], a sedative. In order to obtain this drug he started forging [[Medical prescription|prescription]]s using his colleagues' names as prescribing physicians.&lt;ref name="DokterBibber"/&gt; 

As it turned out later, in the four years following his becoming addicted, he regularly misdiagnosed patients. In order to support his misdiagnoses, he forged diagnostic [[questionnaire]]s from patients, swapped patient [[Medical radiography|x-rays]] and forged laboratory results. He prescribed strong medications unnecessarily for a number of his patients and in a number of cases had patients undergo [[Neurosurgery|brain surgery]] without necessity.&lt;ref name="VKomsterdenNeuroloogWerktWeer"&gt;{{cite news|title=Omstreden neuroloog werkt weer in Duits ziekenhuis|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/5270/Zorg/article/detail/3372278/2013/01/04/Omstreden-neuroloog-werkt-weer-in-Duits-ziekenhuis.dhtml|newspaper=De Volkskrant|date=4 January 2012|language=Dutch|trans-title=Controversial neurologist back at work in German hospital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jansen Steur was forced to resign from the MST by the board in 2004. He received a €250.000 severance package and was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement (together with his former colleagues).&lt;ref name="DokterBibber"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skipr.nl/actueel/id247-medisch-spectrum-twente-zwijgplicht-over-neuroloog.html|title=Medisch Spectrum Twente: zwijgplicht over neuroloog|date=19 January 2009|language=Dutch|trans-title=Medisch Spectrum Twente:oath of secrecy regarding neurlogist}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this deal, he agreed to strike himself from the Dutch [[Licensure|registry]] of medical professionals, thereby giving up the right to practice in the Netherlands. Patients received financial compensation, but were sworn to secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neuroloog deed zonder toestemming bloedonderzoek|url=http://www.tubantia.nl/regio/neuroloog-deed-zonder-toestemming-bloedonderzoek-1.2617020|newspaper=TC Tubantia|language=Dutch|trans-title=Neurologist performed blood tests without permission|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and prosecution==
Despite the deal with Jansen Steur (resulting in his resignation from MST and voluntary removal from the registry), the board of MST decided to begin an investigation in 2009 due to a turnover of board members which included the installation of {{ill|Herre Kingma|nl}} as the new chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurologie.nl/uploads/89/1946/Lemstra_II.pdf|title=Heel de patiënt – Het handelen van de beroepsmatig betrokkenen na het vertrek van een disfunctionerende medisch specialist|date=2 September 2010|work=report of the Tweede externe onderzoekscommissie MST|language=Dutch|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was headed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Wolter Lemstra|nl}}, the former mayor of [[Hengelo]]. The Lemstra committee reported on 1 September 2009, concluding failures on the part of the MST but also of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate ({{nl}}: ''Inspectie voor de Gezondheidszorg'' or ''IGZ''), which was headed by Kingma at the time that Jansen was being sent away from the MST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kst-31700-XVI-176.html?zoekcriteria=%3fzkt%3dUitgebreid%26pst%3dTractatenblad%257CStaatsblad%257CStaatscourant%257CGemeenteblad%257CProvincieblad%257CWaterschapsblad%257CParlementaireDocumenten%26vrt%3dcommissie%2blemstra%26zkd%3dInDeGeheleText%26dpr%3dAnderePeriode%26spd%3d20090106%26epd%3d20100106%26sdt%3dDatumPublicatie%26ap%3d%26pnr%3d1%26rpp%3d10&amp;resultIndex=9&amp;sorttype=1&amp;sortorder=4|title=31 700 XVI Vaststelling van de begrotingsstaten van het Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport (XVI) voor het jaar 2009|last=Klink|first=Ab|date=9 September 2009|work=Aanbiedingsbrief rapport aan Tweede Kamer|publisher=Ministry of Health|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kritiek op rapport omstreden neuroloog|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/224/BINNENLAND/article/detail/260592/2009/09/01/Kritiek-op-rapport-omstreden-neuroloog.dhtml|newspaper=Het Parool|date=1 September 2009|language=Dutch|trans-title=Criticism of report controversial neurologist}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also concluded Jansen had been failing as a doctor since 1992 and that the MST had failed to address the situation for years.&lt;ref name="NOSinspectieFaalde"/&gt;

Upon the release of this report, the [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Dutch minister of Health]] [[Ab Klink]] instituted another investigative committee headed by [[Rein Jan Hoekstra]], to investigate the functioning of the Health Care Inspectorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/blg-67447.html?zoekcriteria=%3fzkt%3dUitgebreid%26pst%3dTractatenblad%257CStaatsblad%257CStaatscourant%257CGemeenteblad%257CProvincieblad%257CWaterschapsblad%257CParlementaireDocumenten%26vrt%3dcommissie%2bhoekstra%26zkd%3dInDeGeheleText%26dpr%3dAnderePeriode%26spd%3d20100505%26epd%3d20100606%26sdt%3dDatumPublicatie%26ap%3d%26pnr%3d1%26rpp%3d10&amp;resultIndex=2&amp;sorttype=1&amp;sortorder=4|title=Angel en Antenne, Het functioneren van de Inspectie voor de Gezondheidszorg in de casus van de neuroloog van het Medisch Spectrum Twente|author=R. J. Hoekstra|authorlink=Rein Jan Hoekstra|date=May 2012|work=Bijlage bij Kamerstuk 32123-XVI nr. 139|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skipr.nl/actueel/id4420-commissie-hoekstra-igz-moet-werkwijze-verbeteren.html|title=Commissie Hoekstra: 'IGZ moet werkwijze verbeteren'|date=27 May 2010|work=Skipr.nl|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This committee supported the conclusions of the Lemstra committee regarding the failing of the Inspectorate, concluding that the Inspectorate waited far too long to take measures against Jansen and should have filed criminal charges against him rather than settling for a voluntary relinquishing of his status as a physician. They also criticized the MST and the doctors treating Jansen Steur for his injuries in that they did not cooperate fully with the investigation by the Inspectorate. Both of Jansen's doctors invoked [[physician–patient privilege]].&lt;ref name="NOSinspectieFaalde"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/160112-inspectie-faalde-in-zaak-verslaafde-neuroloog.html|title=Inspectie faalde in zaak verslaafde neuroloog|last=Van den Brink|first=Rinke|date=27 May 2010|work=nos.nl|publisher=NOS|language=Dutch|trans-title=Inspectorate failed in case of addicted neurologist|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Inspectorate concluded in an internal investigation concluded on 17 February 2009 that they had functioned correctly in the matter of Jansen Steur.&lt;ref name="NOSinspectieFaalde"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten-en-publicaties/kamerstukken/2009/02/20/igz-rapportage-neuroloog-mst.html|title=IGZ rapportage neuroloog MST|work=Records of the Dutch Parliament|publisher=Dutch government|language=Dutch|trans-title=IGZ report neurologist MST|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced in October 2009 that Jansen Steur would have to face charges in court after all, charges having been leveled by a special investigative team of the police for this case (the Lippstadt-team). The team had, by that point, gathered 135 different complaints from patients regarding Jansen Steur.&lt;ref name="DokterBibber"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/20401004/__Omstreden_neuroloog_voor_de_rechter__.html|title=Omstreden neuroloog voor de rechter|date=7 October 2009|work=Telegraaf.nl|publisher=Telegraaf Media Groep|language=Dutch|trans-title=Controversial neurologist to appear in court|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The justice department called the case "the biggest medical trial in the Netherlands ever".&lt;ref name="VKomsterdenNeuroloogWerktWeer"/&gt;

The trial was started on 28 November 2012; it was announced on this first trial day that Jansen Steur was facing 21 criminal charges, including causing grievous bodily and mental harm through misdiagnoses of eight patients, causing one patient to commit suicide, theft, embezzlement and fraud. A total of 40 people filed charges against the doctor.&lt;ref name="NOSneuroloogWeigertOnderzoek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/445504-neuroloog-weigert-onderzoek.html|title=Neuroloog weigert onderzoek|date=28 November 2012|language=Dutch|trans-title=Neurologist refuses investigation|work=NOS.nl|publisher=NOS|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were charges filed by [[personal injury]] expert {{Interlanguage link multi|Yme Drost|nl}}, who filed charges in name of a few dozen injured patients and in name of the families of three patients who died after having been treated by Jansen Steur.&lt;ref name="TelegraafDerdeDode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/20502544/__Aangifte_dode_in_affaire_neuroloog__.html|title=Aangifte derde dode in affaire neuroloog|last=Colijn|first=Jan|last2=Sanders|first2=Charles|date=19 September 2009|work=Telegraaf.nl|publisher=Telegraaf Media Groep|language=Dutch|trans-title=Charges regarding third death filed in case of controversial neurologist|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these charges, charges were filed of scientific fraud, after investigation by the Lemstra committee showed that Jansen Steur had falsified results in order to publish an article in ''[[The Lancet]]''.&lt;ref name="TelegraafDerdeDode"/&gt; The court in [[Arnhem]] sentenced him for deliberately setting misdiagnosis, wrongly prescribing strong medicines and the denial of care. In addition he was considered responsible for a suicide of a female patient due to his diagnosis. The court sentenced in February 2014 3 years of prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3698771/oud-neuroloog-ernst-jansen-steur-krijgt-drie-jaar-cel.html|title=Three years cell|date=11 February 2014|access-date=5 May 2015|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jansen Steur appealed.

[[Metta de Noo]], a physician and acquaintance of Jansen Steur claimed in her book of 2015 that he suffered a [[frontal lobe disorder]] due to the 1990 accident and should not be held criminally accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/4043571/ex-neuroloog-jansen-steur-mogelijk-zelf-niet-bij-hoger-beroep.html|title=Appeal|website=Nu.nl|date=5 May 2015|access-date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; 

==Work in Germany after 2004==
After being forced out of the MST in 2004, Jansen Steur moved to Germany, where he worked for several [[clinic|private clinics]]. After Dutch correspondent [[Rob Vorkink]] tracked him down to the Schlossberg Klinik in [[Bad Laasphe]] and tried to interview him for [[RTV Oost]], Jansen Steur was immediately fired from that institute.&lt;ref name="DokterBibber"/&gt;

The Netherlands was shocked on 4 January 2013 when the [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS evening news]] led with the story that Jansen Steur had found another job as a neurologist in the ''Klinik am Gesundbrunnen'' hospital in [[Heilbronn]]. He was discovered there by the same Rob Vorkink, who recognized Jansen Steur's voice in a phone call (despite his denying that he was the same person).

==History==
In [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]]'s Serbian dictionary, the word ''Gurbet'' means "Gypsy wanderer". The word is derived from Turkish ''gurbet'', meaning "emigrate".&lt;ref&gt;Đura Daničić, Jugoslavenska akademija znanosti i umjetnosti 1891: "U Vukovu rječniku. GUBBET, m. Ciganin skitač, arap. tur. ghurbet, ise\avane. — isporedi gurbetaš, gurbetin."&lt;/ref&gt; The first mentions of nomadic Roma attributed as Gurbeti ancestors, mostly Rroma escaping slavery in Wallachia, is from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Kanyar-Becker 2003: "In addition, in the XVIIth century, one begins to find mentions of nomadic Rroma, mostly Rroma who were escaping the slavery in Valachia - the ancestors of the present-day Gurbeti in Yugoslavia."&lt;/ref&gt; The Gurbeti Roma's ancestors left Wallachia and Moldavia in the 19th century after abolition of slavery. In 1941, most of the Yugoslav Roma settled permanently, with the exception of the Gurbeti in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Serbia Since 1989 |last=Ramet |first=Sabrina P. |author2=Vjeran Pavlaković |year=2005 |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |isbn=978-0-295-98538-1 |page=383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
They share some cultural features with the [[Kalderaš]], but also with other Roma such as [[Xoraxane]]. Gurbeti are partly assimilated into society and do not fully follow the Romany Law. They speak Gurbeti, a sub-dialect of the [[Vlax Romani language]], or sometimes regarded a separate dialect.  

==Diaspora==
There is a Gurbeti diaspora, such as in Austria, were recent migrants, mostly unskilled workers, has since integrated into Austrian society.

==Language==
Their language ("Gurbeti") is a variety of South [[Vlach Romani language]]s.&lt;ref name="HornbergBrüggemann2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sabine Hornberg|author2=Christian Brüggemann|title=Die Bildungssituation von Roma in Europa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bU9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|year=2013|publisher=Waxmann Verlag|isbn=978-3-8309-7841-1|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kosovo, the Gurbeti speech have either a dominant Serbian substratum, or Albanian substratum. The '''Džambazi''' speak a sub-dialect of Gurbeti. The origin of the Romani loan words in Croatian are most likely from Gurbeti, who settled predominantly from Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Schrammel-Ambrosch-Halwachs 2005, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Rade Uhlik translated the ''[[Gospel of Luke]]'' into Bosnian Gurbeti as ''O keriben pal e Devleskre bičhade''. This was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1938, and published in Belgrade.

[[Benin]] is a country of origin and transit for [[trafficking of children|children]] subjected to [[trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[forced labor]] and [[forced prostitution]]. Until recently, analysts also considered Benin a destination country for foreign children brought to the country and subjected to forced [[child labor|labor]], but new information from government and non-government sources indicates the total number of such children is not significant. The majority of victims are girls trafficked into [[domestic servant|domestic servitude]] or the [[commercial sex]] trade in [[Cotonou]], the administrative capital. Some boys are forced to labor on farms, work in construction, produce handicrafts, or hawk items on the street. Many traffickers are relatives or acquaintances of their victims, exploiting the traditional system of vidomegon, in which parents allow their children to live with and work for richer relatives, usually in urban areas. There are reports that some tourists visiting [[Pendjari National Park]] in northern Benin exploit underage girls in [[child prostitution|prostitution]], some of whom may be trafficking victims. Beninese children recruited for forced labor exploitation abroad are destined largely for [[Nigeria]] and [[Gabon]], with some also going to [[Ivory Coast]] and other African countries, where they may be forced to work in [[Mining in Benin|mines]], quarries, or the cocoa sector.&lt;ref name=dos&gt;"Benin". [https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm ''Trafficking in Persons Report 2010'']. [[U.S. Department of State]] (June 14, 2010). {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Benin]] does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so, despite limited resources. Over the last year, the government took steps to accelerate prosecution of trafficking offenders and increase the number of protective and preventive activities. In efforts to prevent human trafficking, it promulgated three decrees regulating the movement of children into and out of Benin and continued its countrywide effort to register births and issue birth certificates to all citizens. The government did not, however, collect and make available to its citizens and partners accurate law enforcement data on human trafficking issues. Further, it did not give its officials specialized training on how to recognize, investigate, and prosecute instances of trafficking.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

U.S. State Department's [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] placed the country in [[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|"Tier 2 Watchlist"]]  in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2017/271117.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2017: Tier Placements|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution==
The government sustained its efforts to bring trafficking offenders to justice during the reporting period. [[National Assembly of Benin|Legislatively]], Benin does not prohibit all forms of trafficking, though its 2006 Act Relating to the Transportation of Minors and the Suppression of Child Trafficking criminalizes all forms of child trafficking and prescribes penalties of up to 20 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and exceed those prescribed for rape. The child trafficking law does not cover adults, though existing laws against kidnapping and labor exploitation give some protection to people more than 18 years old. The Ministry of Justice, Legislation and Human Rights reported that Benin’s eight [[Politics of Benin#Judicial branch|courts]] handled a total of 200 cases of child trafficking and related offenses, including child abduction and corruption of children. At the close of the reporting period, 155 cases remained pending, five cases were dismissed, and 40 cases resulted in convictions; the government neither specified which of these cases involved child trafficking nor provided information on sentences given to convicted trafficking offenders. The Police Brigade for the Protection of Minors (BPM) handled 58 cases involving child trafficking or illegal movement of children out of the country without parental authorization, bringing 17 perpetrators to the Cotonou court for further investigation and prosecution. [[Gendarmerie|Gendarmes]] in the village of Porga arrested suspected traffickers trying to cross the Benin-Burkina Faso border en route to Ivory Coast with five children in April 2009, and delivered them to the court at [[Natitingou]]. The government did not provide information on the outcome of the Porga case, or data on cases handled by other branches of the police. There was no evidence of Beninese government officials’ complicity in trafficking offenses. Although the [[Law enforcement in Benin|senior police]] members were provided training on child trafficking issues as part of their training at the police academy, other officials were not trained to recognize, investigate, and prosecute trafficking offenses.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Protection==
Four government ministries and several international donors and [[NGO]]s effectively used their partnerships to widen Benin’s ability to assist, [[repatriation|repatriate]], and reintegrate victims of trafficking in 2009. The BPM reported rescuing 266 trafficking victims as they were being transported to and from Nigeria, Gabon, Ivory Coast, [[Mali]], and [[Togo]]; these rescues were the product of partnerships with authorities of those countries. This figure represents an increase of 22 more rescues than in the previous year. Furthermore, working with [[UNICEF]] and Gabonese officials, the government repatriated 28 Beninese children, some of whom may have been trafficking victims, rescued from a boat carrying clandestine migrants off the coast of Gabon. In most cases, the BPM took initial custody of victims once inside Benin, and after an interview to confirm their status as trafficking victims, typically referred them to a network of long-term NGO shelters. The BPM holds recovered victims at a large government-built transit shelter it maintained in Cotonou, staffed by seven NGO personnel, until transferring victims to an NGO shelter for reintegration. During 2009, the BPM shelter took in 941 children, many of whom were trafficking victims, and offered them legal, medical, and psychological assistance. The Ministry of Family and National Solidarity worked with NGOs to reunite children with their families. No child goes back to its community of origin until there is a suitable point of reinsertion such as a school, vocational center, or apprenticeship. The government extended access for these children to the national network of social promotion centers, which provide basic social services in each of the country’s 77 communes. Foreign victims of trafficking offenses received assistance from the government through the BPM and social promotion centers before repatriation. According to an NGO leading the repatriation and shelter of Beninese victims from the [[Abeokuta]] quarries in Nigeria, the Beninese Ministry of Family, the BPM, and the Beninese Consulate in Nigeria repatriated 20 trafficking victims between August and December 2009. Both BPM and the office of Family and Child Monitoring at the Ministry of Family established operational databases on child trafficking during the year, but neither yielded data on trafficking victims during the reporting period. Officials encouraged victims to assist in the investigation of trafficking offenders, but shielded children from taking part in the trial unless a judge required it. Victims were not inappropriately incarcerated or fined for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked, but the government did not have a mechanism for screening victims of trafficking among populations of women and children in prostitution.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

==Prevention==
Through partnerships with local and international agencies, the government provided partial support for several new programs to prevent child trafficking. In 2009, the Ministry of Family, with foreign donor support, established 142 new local committees to enable community surveillance in Benin and along the Benin-Nigeria border. The BPM, immigration agents, and gendarmes took up stations at international border crossings to screen travelers and monitor the transport of children. These observers relied on community whistleblowers to alert them to suspicious cases. Furthermore, the government completed ahead of schedule its 2008-2012 National Plan to Combat Child Trafficking and Labor. Also in 2009, the government joined with foreign partners to implement a second anti-child trafficking project to improve living conditions and advance respect for [[children’s rights]], thus addressing key structural causes of Benin’s trafficking problem. The government, in partnership with UNICEF and a major regional bank, launched a seven-day awareness campaign against [[child sex tourism]]. The government provided training to Beninese troops on issues of child trafficking and exploitation prior to their deployment abroad for international [[peacekeeping]] missions.&lt;ref name=dos/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6167">{{Humanism}}
'''Humanism in France''' found its way from [[Italy]], but did not become a distinct movement until the 16th century was well on its way.

On the completion of the [[Hundred Years' War]] between [[France]] and [[England]], the intellectual currents of [[humanism]] began to start. In 1464, [[Peter Raoul]] composed for the [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Duke of Burgundy]] a history of [[Troy]]. At that time the French still regarded themselves as descendants of [[Hector]]. If we except Paris, none of the French universities took part in the movement. Individual writers and printing-presses at Paris, [[Lyon]], [[Rouen]] and other cities became its centres and sources. [[William Fichet]] and [[Robert Gaguin]] are usually looked upon as the first French Humanists. Fichet introduced "the eloquence of Rome" at Paris and set up a press at the Sorbonne. He corresponded with [[Bessarion]] and had in his library volumes of [[Petrarch]], [[Guarino of Verona]] and other Italians. Gaguin copied and corrected [[Suetonius]] in 1468 and other Latin authors. [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio]]'s Jest-book and some of [[Lorenzo Valla|Valla]]'s writings were translated into French. In the reign of [[Louis XI]], who gloried in the title "the first Christian king", French poets celebrated his deeds. The homage of royalty took in part the place among the literary men of France that the cult of antiquity occupied in Italy.

[[Greek language|Greek]], which had been completely forgotten in France, had its first teachers in [[Gregory Tifernas]], who reached Paris, 1458, [[John Lascaris]], who returned with [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]], and [[Hermonymus of Sparta]], who had [[Reuchlin]] and [[Budaeus]] (known variously as William Budaeus (English), Guillaume Budé (French) and Guilielmus Budaeus (Latin)) among his scholars. An impetus was given to the new studies by the Italian, [[Aleander]], afterwards famous for his association with [[Martin Luther]] at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. He lectured in Paris, 1509, on [[Plato]] and issued a ''Latino-Greek lexicon''. In 1512 his pupil, [[Vatable]], published the Greek grammar of [[Chrysoloras]]. [[Budaeus]], perhaps the foremost Greek scholar of his day, founded the [[Collège de France]], 1530, and finally induced [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] to provide for instruction in [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and Greek. The [[University of Paris]] at the close of the 14th century was sunk into a low condition and [[Erasmus]] bitterly complained of the food, the morals and the intellectual standards of the [[college of Montague]] which he attended. Budaeus urged the combination of the study of the Scriptures with the study of the classics and exclaimed of the [[Gospel of John]], "What is it, if not the almost perfect sanctuary of the truth!"
[[Image:Francois Rabelais - Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[François Rabelais]]]]
[[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] studied in Paris, [[Pavia]], [[Padua]] and [[Cologne]] and, for longer or shorter periods, tarried in the greater Italian cities. He knew Greek and some Hebrew. From 1492–1506 he was engaged in editing the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Raymundus Lullus]] and then, under the protection of [[Guillaume Briçonnet (Bishop of Meaux)|Guillaume Briçonnet]], [[bishop of Meaux]], he turned his attention to theology. It was his purpose to offset the ''Sentences'' of [[Peter the Lombard]] by a system of theology giving only what the [[Scriptures]] teach. In 1509, he published the ''Psalterum quintuplex'', a combination of five Latin versions of the Psalms, including a revision and a commentary by his own hand. In 1512, he issued a revised Latin translation of the [[Pauline Epistles]] with commentary. In this work, he asserted the authority of the Bible and the doctrine of justification by faith, without appreciating, however, the far-reaching significance of the latter opinion. Three years after the appearance of Luther's [[New Testament]], Lefevre's French translation appeared, 1523. It was made from the [[Vulgate]], as was his translation of the [[Old Testament]], 1528. In 1522 and 1525, appeared his commentaries on the four Gospels and the [[Catholic Epistles]]. The former was put on the Index by the [[Sorbonne]]. The opposition to the free spirit of inquiry and to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], which the Sorbonne stirred up and French royalty adopted, forced him to flee to [[Strassburg]] and then to the liberal court of [[Margaret of Angoulême]].

Among those who came into contact with Lefevre were [[Farel]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]], the Reformers of [[Geneva]]. In the meantime [[Clément Marot]], 1495–1544, the first true poet of the French literary revival, was composing his French versification of the Psalms and of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The Psalms were sung for pleasure by French princes and later for worship in Geneva and by the [[Huguenot]]s. When Calvin studied the humanities and law at Bourges, [[Orléans]] and Paris, about 1520, he had for teachers Cordier and L'Etoile, the canonists, and [[Melchior Wolmar]], teacher of Greek, whose names the future Reformer records with gratitude and respect. He gave himself passionately to Humanistic studies and sent to Erasmus a copy of his work on Seneca's ''Clemency'', in which he quoted frequently from the ancient classics and the Fathers. Had he not adopted the new religious views, it is possible he would now be known as an eminent figure in the history of French Humanism.

The '''Indiana University Dance Marathon''', commonly known as '''IU Dance Marathon''' or '''IUDM''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iudm.org/?page_id=335 IUDM Nomenclature Guide].&lt;/ref&gt; is a 36-hour [[Dance Marathon]] that takes place every November at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]] with the purpose of raising both funding and awareness for pediatric care. In 1991, student Jill Stewart started IU Dance Marathon in honor of her friend, Ryan White, who died from AIDS the year before. Since then, IUDM has raised over $36 million for [[Riley Hospital for Children]] in [[Indianapolis, IN]], including $4,203,326.23 during the 2017 marathon year. The 2018 marathon took place November 2nd through November 4th and raised $4,187,051.23.

===Ryan White===

[[Ryan White]]'s 1990 death was the inspiration for the creation of the Indiana University Dance Marathon in 1991. Thirteen-year-old Ryan White contracted AIDS from contaminated blood transfusions he received for hemophilia. When news of the contraction of AIDS became public, his school district in Kokomo, Indiana banned him from attending classes. Ryan then went on to fight in court which led to many headlines across the country and national celebrities like Michael Jackson and Elton John advocated on his behalf. Michael Jackson and Elton John befriended Ryan and helped to spread his story and awareness of AIDS.

After arduous court battles, Ryan won the right to return to school; but his battle with the community and AIDS had just begun. The White family dealt with adversity on a daily basis. People were not willing to deal with the concept of AIDS and shunned the Whites. They were victims of fear and anger but had an optimistic outlook that eventually things would return to normal. It was not until a bullet was shot into the White home that the family moved to Cicero, Indiana, where they found peace.

Ryan White was one of the biggest advocates of AIDS awareness, appearing at schools and fundraisers across the nation and testified in front of the President's Commission on HIV Epidemic in hopes of changing the public's perception of the disease.

On April 8, 1990, Ryan White died at the age of 18, right before he was to attend Indiana University.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Dirk (April 9, 1990). [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/09/obituaries/ryan-white-dies-of-aids-at-18-his-struggle-helped-pierce-myths.html "Ryan White Dies of AIDS at 18; His Struggle Helped Pierce Myths."] New York Times. Web. Retrieved May 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His strength and acceptance of disease helped those battling common illnesses continue to fight. Ryan's life is commemorated by the annual Dance Marathon funds and the Ryan White Infectious Disease Center at Riley Hospital.

===Ashley Louise Crouse===

On Tuesday, April 12, 2005, the Indiana University campus suffered a loss with the death of one of its students, Ashley Louise Crouse. Ashley was the Vice President of Communications for IUDM and a member of [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]] sorority. On her way home from an executive meeting, Ashley was struck and killed by a drunk driver outside the sorority house in which she lived, leaving behind a legacy of hope and passion that continues to live within each person involved in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanski, Matt (October 28, 2012).

Born and raised in Carmel, Indiana, Ashley's hometown joined with IUDM to create the most successful high school dance marathon in the country. In addition, along with Ryan White, the two are remembered by the thousands of IU students each year during a walk of remembrance each spring.&lt;ref&gt;Dai, Michelle (February 27, 2014).

[[Image:IUDM 2013 Total.jpg|thumb|200px|right|IUDM 2013 Total]]

The marathon takes place at the Indiana University Tennis Center, located on campus just north of [[Assembly Hall (Bloomington)|Assembly Hall]] and [[Memorial Stadium (Indiana)|Memorial Stadium]], from Friday to Sunday one weekend in November. Those volunteering, or dancing, stand for 12, 24, or 36 hours in honor of those who cannot.

Before the event, all dancers participate in Color Wars fall semester long competition between 8 color teams that compete during the months leading up to the marathon and throughout the duration of the 36 hour dance marathon event. Dancer organizations are randomly divided into color teams and work together to earn points for their color by participating in weekly competitions, fundraising, 3 large-scale events, marathon stage games, and marathon participation. The winner of color wars for the year is announced at the marathon just before the raising of the total.

Committee members come together to set up, run the event and inspire others for the duration of the weekend. The marathon starts at 8 PM Friday night with dancers running into the gym to the song, "[[Eye of the Tiger]]." The executive council is then introduced and the dancers get to witness the famous IUDM Linedance for the first time. After the opening ceremonies, the teams are split up in a variety of stations around the center, including stations geared toward learning the linedance, hospitality and sports activities.

At certain times all teams and committee members come together to hear artist and speakers perform, participate in activities on stage and listen to Riley stories. Every year, IUDM has many visitors during the duration of the marathon, including IU alumni, faculty and administration, donors, and most importantly, the Riley families. Everyone at the marathon gathers to meet and listen to dozens of Riley children tell their stories. Each Riley kid walks down a red carpet, through the crowd, and up onto the stage, as each participant cheers them onward. During theirs presentations, the room falls silent and everyone uses this moment as a reminder of why they are standing.

As the marathon comes to a conclusion, the presidential address is given and all participants gather to remember those to which they stand for. Finally, the total is raised officially marking the end of the marathon and showing the hard work put in by thousands over the course of the year.

In 2018, IUDM raised $4,187,051.23. IUDM 2018 will take place from November 2nd through the 4th.

The '''International Day for Biological Diversity''' (or '''World Biodiversity Day''') is a [[United Nations]]–sanctioned [[International observances|international day]] for the promotion of [[biodiversity]] issues.  It is currently held on [[May 22]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) page for IBD |url=http://www.cbd.int/idb/|accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Day for Biological Diversity falls within the scope of the UN Post-2015 Development Agenda's [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In this larger initiative of international cooperation, the topic of biodiversity concerns stakeholders in [[sustainable agriculture]]; [[desertification]], [[land degradation]] and drought; [[right to water|water]] and [[sanitation]]; health and [[sustainable development]]; energy; science, technology and innovation, [[knowledge-sharing]] and capacity-building; [[urban resilience]] and adaptation; [[sustainable transport]]; [[climate change]] and [[disaster risk reduction]]; oceans and seas; forests; [[social vulnerability|vulnerable groups]] including [[indigenous peoples]]; and [[food security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1554TST_compendium_issues_briefs_rev1610.pdf|url = https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/1554TST_compendium_issues_briefs_rev1610.pdf&amp;embedded=true|website = docs.google.com|accessdate = 2015-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical role of biodiversity in sustainable development was recognized in a [http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=29343&amp;L=0 Rio+20] outcome document, "The World We Want: A Future for All".

From its creation by the Second Committee of the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1993 until 2000, it was held on December 29 to celebrate the day the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] went into effect. On December 20, 2000,&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;

==Activities==
Coinciding with the observance of International Day for Biological Diversity, on May 2011 [[Indonesia]]n Forestry Minister inaugurated the Ciwalen Canopy Trail that is {{convert|120|m}} long and {{convert|60|m}} wide at an elevation of {{convert|30|–|40|m}} above the ground at [[Gunung Gede Pangrango National Park]], [[West Java]], to accommodate five to ten people in one trip.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/71957/forestry-minister-inaugurates-ciwalen-canopy-trail&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 theme of Island Biodiversity was chosen because islands provide a rich source of biodiversity for plants, animals, fish and forestry products. Many indigenous fruits and [[Leaf vegetable|green leafy vegetables]] are rich in [[micronutrient]]s. According to the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], two out of every three deaths  can be attributed to [[Non-communicable disease]]s (NCDs). These can result from a change in diets linked to consumption of highly processed imported products, while local crop species are abandoned or reduced in the local diet. As a consequence, island representatives meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in May, 2014 stressed that serious consideration should be given to more research and policy action with the aim of increasing diet diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific need more research and policy intervention to stem the reduction in (bio)diversity in the diet|url=http://cta.int/en/article/2014-05-21/africa-the-caribbean-and-the-pacific-need-more-research-and-policy-intervention-to-stem-the-reductio.html|publisher=CTA|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the precise extent of Jang Song-thaek's power and position during his life cannot be confirmed, in 2008 [[Government of South Korea|South Korean government]] officials and academic North Korea experts suggested that he had taken on ''de facto'' leadership over North Korea while Kim Jong-il's health was declining and when Kim subsequently died.&lt;ref name="Times-2008-11-08"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article5107960.ece|title=North Korea 'is being run by Kim Jong Il's brother-in-law'|author=Ben Webster|work=The Times|location=London|date=8 November 2008|accessdate=8 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jang was vice-chairman of the [[National Defence Commission]], a position considered second only to that of the Supreme Leader.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Choe|first=Sang-hun|title=N.

In December 2013, Jang was abruptly accused of being a [[counter-revolutionary]] and was stripped of all his posts and expelled from the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK).

==Early life and family==
Jang was born in [[Chongjin]], during the [[Soviet Civil Administration]] of Northern Korea. He graduated from the Kim Il-sung Senior High School before leaving for Moscow, where he studied at [[Moscow State University]] between 1968 and 1972.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;James E. Hoare, [https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/resource/modern-korean-history-portal/jang-seong-taek Jang Seong-taek, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars].&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return, he married [[Kim Kyong-hui]], the younger (and only) sister of [[Kim Jong-il]].&lt;ref name="Unikorea"/&gt; The couple had a daughter, Jang Kum-song (1977–2006), who lived in [[Paris, France|Paris]] as an [[international student]]; she refused an order to return to [[Pyongyang]] and then reportedly committed suicide in September 2006, due to Jang and his wife's opposition to her relationship with her boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.joins.com/article/2450717.html?ctg=1000|title=파리의 김정일 조카 장금송 비운의 러브스토리 (Unlucky love story of Kim Jong-il's niece in Paris)|language=Korean|work=JoongAng Ilbo|date=18 September 2006|accessdate=30 May 2007|last=Yi|first=Yeong-jong|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233252/http://www.joins.com/article/2450717.html?ctg=1000|archivedate=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Kyong-hui was reported executed by poison in May 2014 because she complained about her husband's execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/02/10/north-korea-executions/80173970/|title=North Korea executions under Kim Jong Un|last=Petras|first=George|date=2016-02-10|work=|newspaper=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Beginning in the 1970s, Jang held a series of positions in the [[Workers' Party of Korea]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; His first post was as an instructor for the [[Pyongyang]] City Committee of the Workers' Party.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=250566496 "Leader's Uncle Rose To No. 2 In North Korea"], 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s, however Jang's career stalled when he was sent away from the central party to be manager of a steel and ironworks in [[Nampo]], an apparent demotion. Reports said that he was becoming too powerful or, according to other accounts, he had an over-ostentatious lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; It was reported that Jang suffered severe burns in an [[industrial accident]] at the factory in [[Chollima-guyok|Chollima]]/[[Kangso-guyok|Kangson]].&lt;ref name="NKLW"&gt;[http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/kim-family/jang-song-thaek/#_edn3 Jang Song Taek], North Korea Leadership Watch.&lt;/ref&gt; His career recovered and he became deputy director of the Youth Work Department of the KWP Central Committee in 1982 and director in 1985. He was first elected to the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] (SPA), North Korea's nominal parliament, in 1986.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

In April 1989, Jang was made a [[Orders and Medals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|People's Hero]]; in June 1989, he was elected an alternate member of the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; In April 1992, He was named a member of the [[Orders and Medals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|Order of Kim Il-sung]]. Later that year he was promoted to full member of the Central Committee. He was a member of the funeral committee for Kim Il-sung in 1994.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"/&gt; Jang was appointed to be the first deputy director (or vice director) of the WPK's Organization and Guidance Department in November 1995.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; He had been identified by outside analysts as well as [[North Korean defectors|North Korean defector]] [[Hwang Jang-yop]] as a possible successor to Kim Jong-il; however, on 25 November 2004, [[South Korea]]'s [[National Assembly of South Korea|National Assembly]] heard testimony that he had been purged from his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Seattle Times |title=Kim Jong-il purges relative from power, paving way for sons |date=4 December 2004 |accessdate=20 August 2007 |last=Demick |first=Barbara |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002113774_kim09.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929175140/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002113774_kim09.html |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some South Korean intelligence reports indicated that Jang was under [[house arrest]] in Pyongyang, while others suggested he might have been sent for "reeducation".&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25197601 Profile: Chang Song-thaek], ''BBC News'' (12 December 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rehabilitation==
Jang re-emerged in March 2006, accompanying Kim Jong-il on an official visit to China.&lt;ref name="Unikorea"/&gt; In October 2007, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] confirmed that Jang had been promoted to the newly recreated post of first vice-director of the Workers' Party of Korea, with oversight responsibility for the police, judiciary, and other areas of internal security; Jang attended [[President of South Korea|South Korean president]] [[Roh Moo-hyun]]'s luncheon during the latter's visit to the North.&lt;ref name="Yonhap"/&gt; It was later revealed that Jang had been actually appointed director of the Administration Department, an old agency of the Workers' Party abolished in 1990 and re-created by splitting the Organization Department. He was elected to the [[National Defence Commission of North Korea|National Defence Commission]] in April 2009. He was made vice-chairman of the commission in summer 2010.&lt;ref name=wtimes&gt;{{cite news|author=Ashish Kumar Sen|title=Kim's heir apparent set for debut in Pyongyang|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/sep/26/kims-heir-apparent-set-for-debut-in-pyongyang/|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period he was a close ally of Kim Jong-il.&lt;ref name=wtimes/&gt; Jang was still in the post four years later, in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James A. Lyons|title=The right response to North Korea|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/22/the-right-response-to-north-korea/|accessdate=13 December 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NDC is North Korea's ''de facto'' supreme decision-making body; Jang's promotion made him a key executive deputy, second only to Kim Jong-il. It is speculated that the move was part of posturing to make Kim Jong-il's son [[Kim Jong-un]] the next leader of North Korea.&lt;ref name="yonhap"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Kim|title=N. Korean leader shows up at parliament, shakes up posts: report|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2010/06/07/66/0401000000AEN20100607008200315F.HTML|work=Yonhap News Agency|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jang's position in North Korean politics was also ostensibly boosted by the death of [[Ri Je-gang]], a senior leader who was tipped by Kim Jong-il as a crucial overseer of the succession campaign.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

==Under Kim Jong-un==
On 25 December 2011, North Korean television Sunday showed Jang in the uniform of a [[Comparative military ranks of Korea|general]]. A Seoul official familiar with North Korea affairs said it was the first time Jang has been shown on state television in a military uniform. His appearance suggested that Jang had secured a key role in the North's military, which had pledged its allegiance to Kim Jong-un.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/25/us-korea-north-power-idUSTRE7BO02I20111225 |work = Reuters |title = North Korean power-behind-throne emerges as neighbors meet |date = 25 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jang's importance continued to be demonstrated during his 2012 visit to China: various aspects of the visit echoed protocol which had previously been followed only for Kim Jong-il, including half of his entourage arriving ahead of time as an advance party, with the [[List of Ambassadors from China to North Korea|Chinese ambassador to North Korea]], [[Liu Hongcai]], returning to China beforehand to greet Jang upon his arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2012/08/16/2012081601187.html |title = China Rolls Out Red Carpet for N.Korea's Jang Song-taek |work = The Chosun Ilbo |date = 17 August 2012 |accessdate = 17 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 August 2012, Jang met with [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|China's premier]], [[Wen Jiabao]] in Ziguangge, [[Zhongnanhai]].

On 4 November 2012, the WPK Central Committee Politburo established a new State Physical Culture and Sports Guidance Commission, appointing Jang as its first chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on Enlarged Meeting of Political Bureau of WPK Central Committee |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201211/news04/20121104-04ee.html |work=Korean Central News Agency |date=4 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213115505/http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2012/201211/news04/20121104-04ee.html |archivedate=13 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst suggests that this quiet promotion may have signaled a decline in Jang's status: in North Korea, "although sports can bring quick popularity, earn foreign exchange, raise patriotic fever, and help burn the energies of the youth and distract the masses from their daily hardships, it can never beat national security and socio-economic development in terms of its political significance. By asking Jang to chair the National Sports Commission, the young North Korean leader, less than a year into power, might have begun to nudge his uncle out of important policy deliberations."&lt;ref name="Dramatic"&gt;Alexandre Mansourov, [http://38north.org/2013/12/amansourov120913 "North Korea: The Dramatic Fall of Jang Song Thaek"], U.S.-Korea Institute at SAIS, 9 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, speculation arose that Jang had been quietly promoted to top decision-making Politburo Presidium member, as his official hierarchy position was elevated, displacing then-Chief of General Staff [[Hyon Yong-chol]] and his own wife Kim Kyong-hui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = JST on Political Bureau Presidium? |url = http://nkleadershipwatch.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/jst-on-political-bureau-presidium |work = North Korea Leadership Watch |date = 8 January 2013 |accessdate = 9 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst argued that Jang might be appointed president of the presidium of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] (making him the nominal head of state of the DPRK) or premier, replacing officeholders who were in their 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Alexandre Mansourov |title = A Dynamically Stable Regime |url = http://38north.org/2012/12/amansourov121712/ |work = 38 North |date = 17 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jang Song-thaek promoted the construction of a new bridge over the Yalu River between the Chinese city of Dandong and the Korean city of Sinuiju. {{As of|December 2013}}, the bridge was nearly completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Cathcart |first = Adam |title = Blind Legacy: Jang Song-taek and North Korea's Invisible Cross-Border Bridge |url = http://sinonk.com/2013/12/09/jang-song-taek-bridge-sinuiju-dandong |work = Sino-NK |date = 9 December 2013 |accessdate = 4 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, Jang was not invited to the meeting of top North Korean officials handling national security and foreign affairs, following a [[Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 Unit 2|rocket launch on 12 December 2012]], and new international sanctions in response.&lt;ref name="Dramatic"/&gt; Following Jang's fall from power, an analyst noted that Jang's "glaring absence" at the January 2013 meeting "signaled the emergence of a possible crack in the senior leadership, especially in the relationship between Kim and his all-powerful uncle, raising the possibility of divergent approaches between Kim and Jang" on [[Foreign relations of North Korea|North Korea foreign policy]].&lt;ref name="Dramatic"/&gt;

In late May 2013, [[Choe Ryong-hae]], a vice-chairman of Central Military Commission and director of the KPA General Political Department, was sent as Kim Jong-un's first [[special envoy]] to China, passing over Jang.&lt;ref name="Dramatic"/&gt; An analyst viewed this as a "striking" choice, and noted that "it appears that as the perceived 'China man in Pyongyang{{'"}}, Jang's "perceived close ties with China may have done a disservice to his standing in the eyes of Kim, exposed him to criticism of being too subservient to China, and made him vulnerable to any anti-China backlash in Pyongyang".&lt;ref name="Dramatic"/&gt; Thought &lt;!-- by whom? --&gt; to have been particularly unacceptable to Kim Jong-un were Jang's "continued expression of sympathy towards" [[Kim Jong-nam]]&amp;mdash;Kim Jong-un's half-brother and Kim Jong-il's eldest son&amp;mdash;who was living in exile under Chinese protection at the time.&lt;ref name="Dramatic"/&gt;

According to the ''[[New York Times]]'', the final straw came from a dispute over control of North Korea's west coast fisheries. These had been partly taken from the military by Kim Jong-un in 2011, but later this decision was reversed and the fisheries were ordered returned to the military. Forces loyal to Jang defied the transfer, leading to a confrontation in late 2013, in which several North Korean soldiers loyal to Kim Jong-un were killed. Subsequent reinforcements sent by Kim Jong-un seized control of the fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Choe Sang-Hun |first = David E.

Jang had not been seen in public since. On 3 December he was dismissed from his post.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=North Korean leader's powerful uncle dismissed – Seoul media|work=Reuters|date=3 December 2013|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/12/03/korea-north-jang-idINL4N0JI1N120131203}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December, his appearances were obscured or edited out from a news report (originally aired in October) that re-aired on [[Korean Central Television]].&lt;ref name="Guardian_20131209"/&gt;

On 8 December, Jang Song-thaek was publicly expelled from the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK), with state media attributing this to a decision of the [[Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Politburo]]. Jang was accused of having committed "anti-party, counter-revolutionary factional acts" that included illicit affairs with women; harboring "politically-motivated ambition"; weakening "the party's guidance over judicial, prosecution and people's security bodies" and obstructing "the nation's economic affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf|title=Report on Enlarged Meeting of Political Bureau of Central Committee of WPK|work=Korean Central News Agency|location=North Korea|date=8 December 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304112449/http://www.kcna.kp/kcna.user.article.retrieveNewsViewInfoList.kcmsf|archivedate=4 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2700-word statement was released, stating that the "despicable human scum Jang, who was worse than a dog, perpetrated thrice-cursed acts of treachery in betrayal of such profound trust and warmest paternal love shown by the party and the leader for him". The statement detailed many charges against Jang, stating that he "had desperately worked for years to destabilize and bring down the DPRK and grab the supreme power of the party and state by employing all the most cunning and sinister means and methods".&lt;ref name="Means"&gt;Alexandre Mansourov, [http://38north.org/2013/12/amansourov121313 "North Korea: What Jang's Execution Means for the Future"], 38north.org; 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement accused Jang of freeing "the undesirable and alien elements, including those who had been dismissed and relieved of their posts after being severely punished for disobeying the instructions of Kim Jong Il and "let them work in the WPK CC [Korean Workers' Party Central Committee] Administrative Department and organs under it in a crafty manner", which some analysts claim indicates that Jang had instigated a nationwide amnesty in January 2012 which included the closure of several [[Prisons in North Korea|North Korea prison camps]] and the release of prisoners. An analyst suggested that "since most of the political prisoners freed at that time are now deemed as Jang's factionists, most of them are likely to be returned to jail again". The statement accused Jang of bringing "serious harm to the youth movement in the DPRK, being part of the group of renegades and traitors in the field of youth work, bribed by the enemies".&lt;ref name="Means"/&gt;

An analyst believes that [[Choe Ryong-hae]], "the party-appointed shepherd of the North Korean youth for over a decade" through his position in the [[Kimilsungist-Kimjongilist Youth League|Kim Il-sung Socialist Youth League]], linked Jang to this crime.&lt;ref name="Means"/&gt; The statement accused Jang of seeking to enlarge his own power, "stretching his tentacles to all ministries and national institutions" and turning the Korean Workers' Party Central Committee Administration Department, which Jang led, into a "little kingdom which no one dares touch"; Kim Jong-un disbanded the Administrative Department after Jang's fall.&lt;ref name="Means"/&gt; The statement also said that Jang had "systematically denied the party line and policies, its organizational will" as if he were "a special being who could overrule either issues decided by the party or its line" and that Jang had been "disobeying the order of the Supreme Commander of the KPA" (i.e. undermining Kim's rule).&lt;ref name="Means"/&gt; He was also accused of undermining the Kim [[personality cult]],&lt;ref name="Means"/&gt; which included placing a granite monument carved with the supreme leader's words "in a shaded corner"; letting "the decadent capitalist lifestyle find its way to our society by distributing all sorts of pornographic pictures among his confidants"; and "half-heartedly clapping, touching off towering resentment of our service personnel and people" when one of Kim Jong-un's promotions was announced.&lt;ref name=executed-ap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/world/asia/north-korea-says-uncle-of-executed.html "North Korea Says Kim's Uncle Executed"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 12 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alastair Gale, [https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/12/13/what-north-korea-said-about-jang-song-thaek "What North Korea Said About Jang Song Thaek"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
On 12 December 2013, Jang was tried by a special military tribunal of the [[State Security Department|Ministry of State Security]] and executed, according to state media.&lt;ref&gt;Yonhap News Agency, [http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/12/13/12/0301000000AEN20131213002451315F.html "N. Korea executes leader's uncle for 'treason': KCNA"], 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grasping"/&gt;

Chinese media and North Korea experts suggested that Jang Song-thaek's fall reflected a rejection of his efforts to prioritize economic development, and a victory for North Korean advocates of a [[Songun|military-first policy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/831035.shtml "Jang's fall won't exert significant influence on East Asian dynamics"], ''Global Times'', 9 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Chang Yong-seok, senior researcher at the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at [[Seoul National University]], said Jang was "the only one in the North who could talk about economic change. So, when I heard of Mr. Jang's execution, my first thought was that it was a death notice for those of us who have hoped for economic reform in the North."&lt;ref name="Grasping"&gt;Choe Sang-hun, [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/world/asia/execution-raises-doubts-about-kims-grip-on-north-korea.html "Grasping for Clues in North Korean Execution"], ''New York Times'', 14 December 2013; accessed 4 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts of North Korean politics agreed that Jang's execution was the most significant since purges carried out in the 1950s by [[Kim Il-Sung]], Kim Jong-un's grandfather and North Korea's founder; since 1960, purged top officials have not usually been killed, and the denunciations of purged figures have not typically been so extreme and public.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"&gt;Ed Flanagan, [http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/13/21889289-execution-of-kim-jong-uns-uncle-recalls-grandfathers-lethal-era "Execution of Kim Jong Un's uncle recalls grandfather's lethal era"], ''NBC News'', 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose Kim, [http://www.smh.com.au/world/execution-sign-of-a-regime-on-the-edge-20131213-hv5li.html "Execution sign of a regime on the edge"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Charles K. Armstrong]], an expert on [[North Korea]] at [[Columbia University]], stated that "although high-ranking leaders, including members of the Kim family, have been deposed before, we haven't seen anything this public or dramatic since Kim Jong-un's grandfather Kim Il-sung purged his last major rivals in the late 1950s. This seems to indicate the divisions within the Kim regime were more serious than previously thought."&lt;ref name="Grasping"/&gt; Former [[U.S. National Security Council]] director for Asian affairs [[Victor Cha]] said that the purge and execution of Jang "tells you that everything's not normal ... When you take out Jang, you're not taking out just one person – you're taking out scores if not hundreds of other people in the system. It's got to have some ripple effect."&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

On the other hand, some analysts suggested that Jang's influence and role had been exaggerated.&lt;ref name="Chung-in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chungin-moon/is-kim-jong-un-the-reformer_b_4651493.html|title=Is Kim Jong Un The Reformer, And The Executed Uncle Jang Seong-Taek The Reactionary?|publisher=Huffington Post|date=23 January 2014|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Chung-in Moon from [[Yonsei University]] noted that there had been no policy shifts in the North Korean government and that some of Jang's closest associates, including [[Pak Pong-ju]] and [[Kang Sok-ju]], had kept their positions. He also noted that Kim Jong-un's cabinet continued to emphasize economic incentive systems, innovation, and economic cooperation with China. Professor Chung-in said that "He [Jang] could, therefore, have been purged and executed because of his obsession with material and organizational interests that challenged Kim Jong Un's reform initiative to streamline the country's economic management. If this turns out to be true, then Kim Jong Un should be seen as a reformer, whilst Jang was a reactionary."&lt;ref name="Chung-in"/&gt; In another analysis he stressed that Jang's removal had not weakened the government, which was actually more stable than before: "The politics of extensive surveillance, control, fear and intimidation are still alive and well. The party, the state, the military and security apparatus remain committed, effective and unified in purpose. The dramatic episode of Jang's downfall has created a formidable deterrent to any potential or actual opposing groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://38north.org/2014/02/cmoon022414/|title=Shocking, But Not a Game Changer: Unraveling Regime Dynamics in Post-Jang North Korea|publisher=38north|date=24 February 2014|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following Jang's fall, experts speculated that purges of other top figures might follow. An anonymous source said Ji Jae-ryong, North Korean ambassador to China and a close associate of Jang, "will eventually be dealt with";&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/12/11/2013121101792.html N.Korean Ambassador to China Likely for the Chop], ''[[Chosun Ilbo]]'', 11 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; however South Korean diplomatic sources said it was "business as usual" at that embassy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/131209/business-usual-n-korean-ambassador-china-source "'Business as usual' for N.

The public received word of Jang's dismissal in the ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'' on 12 December and were called to meetings to denounce Jang and pledge loyalty to Kim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=11261&amp;cataId=nk03100 "Workers in Public Loyalty Pledge"], DailyNK, 12 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on 14 December, the [[Korean Central News Agency]] (KCNA) released a roster of six top officials appointed to a national committee in charge of organizing a [[state funeral]] for [[Kim Kuk-tae]] (a former Workers' Party official who recently died).

The status of Kim Kyong-hui's relationship with Jang had been a subject of frequent speculation. Analysts believe that Jang and Kim Kyong-hui had been estranged.&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt; Yoon Sang-hyun, a [[National Assembly of South Korea]] deputy floor leader of the governing [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]], had said previously that Kim had been "separated" from Jang and did not oppose his purge.&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt; Following the execution, ''[[The Chosun Ilbo|Chosun Ilbo]]'' reported that [[Choe Ryong-hae]] may now be the "number 2 man" in North Korea. The South Korean newspaper reported claims that Kim Jong-il "asked Choe on his deathbed to help his son Jong-un" but that the North Korean military disapproves of Choe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/12/19/2013121901640.html "Is Choe Ryong-hae Now N.Korea's Most Powerful Man?"], ''Chosun Ilbo'', 19 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|China}}&amp;nbsp;– Following the reports of Jang's death, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China|Chinese foreign ministry]] stated only that the fall of Jang was a "domestic issue", but reports indicated that "China's North Korea experts have been working furiously to come up with [a] consensus" about the resulting implications.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt; Chinese foreign minister [[Wang Yi (politician)|Wang Yi]] stated that China is observing the situation, but that it does not expect major shifts in North Korean policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China watching North Korea for impact of execution of Kim's uncle|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1382887/china-watching-north-korea-impact-execution-kims-uncle|work=South China Morning Post|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{flag|United Kingdom}}&amp;nbsp;– [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime minister]] [[David Cameron]]'s official spokesman told reporters at a daily press briefing: "If this is confirmed, it is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime." [[Hugo Swire]], [[minister of state]] at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]], said: "We are deeply concerned to learn of the execution. This is another example of the brutality of the North Korean government, and we have consistently raised concerns about severe and systematic human rights abuses. The UN is currently running a commission of inquiry and it is quite right that we do everything we can to investigate North Korea's appalling human rights record. More broadly, we remain deeply concerned about the impact of this unpredictable regime on stability in the region. Our embassy in Pyongyang is monitoring the situation closely and we will continue to maintain close contact with our allies on this." [[Lord Alton of Liverpool]], chair of the North Korea [[All-Party Parliamentary Group]], said Jang "represented for many the real hope for reform in North Korea" and stated that Jang's execution was a "bloody and vivid and brutal reminder of the inherent and cruel nature of a regime that has always modelled itself on Stalin's USSR" and its [[gulag]] system.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/uk/execution-shows-extreme-brutality-29835788.html Execution 'shows extreme brutality'], ''Belfast Telegraph'', 13 December 2013; accessed 4 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flag|United States}}&amp;nbsp;– [[United States Department of State|State Department]] deputy spokeswoman [[Marie Harf]] told the media on 12 December 2013: "While we cannot independently verify this development, we have no reason to doubt the official KCNA report that Jang Song Thaek has been executed. If confirmed, this is another example of the extreme brutality of the North Korean regime."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cheng, [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303932504579254632008825604 "North Korea Says Uncle of Kim Jong Un Executed: Jang Song Thaek Was Until Recently the Country's De Facto No. 2 Ruler"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 12 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, at the State Department's press briefing, Harf stated that "we would urge the North Koreans not to take provocative acts, not to do so going forward, because it's not in the interest of regional stability".&lt;ref name="Warns"&gt;AFP, [http://www.vanguardngr.com/2013/12/us-warns-n-korea-provocation-following-execution/ US warns N.

We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region."&lt;ref&gt;Chad O'Carroll, [http://www.nknews.org/2013/12/north-korea-executes-jang-song-thaek-for-factionalism "North Korea executes ‘traitor’ Jang Song Thaek"], NK News; accessed 4 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John F. Kerry]] stated in an interview broadcast on ABC's ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' on 15 December that Jang's fate "tells us a lot about … how ruthless and reckless" and "insecure" Kim Jong-un is, and described Kim as "spontaneous, erratic, still worried about his place in the power structure and maneuvering to eliminate" potential competitors.&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt; Kerry stated that Kim leads a "ruthless, horrendous dictatorship" and Kerry urged the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|denuclearization of North Korea]].&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt; [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John McCain]], member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], said of Kim on [[CNN]]'s ''[[State of the Union with Candy Crowley|State of the Union]]'': "I think it's very obvious this young man is capable of some very aberrational behavior, and given the toys that he has, I think it's very dangerous. You would think that the Chinese would understand that, as well. They've got to rein this young man in—and they can."&lt;ref name="Choe"/&gt;
* {{flag|United Nations}}&amp;nbsp;– [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Ban Ki-moon]], formerly the South Korean foreign minister, stated on 16 December that he found reports of the execution to be "very dramatic and surprising" and appealed for calm, stating: "At this time, I would appeal to all the parties concerned, surrounding the Korean Peninsula, while they must be vigilantly and carefully watching the development of situation, not to take any premature actions. I do not hope that because of that there will be some increase of tensions on the Korean Peninsula."&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2013/12/17/13/0301000000AEN20131217000151315F.html "U.N. chief cautions against 'premature actions' on N.

I stand ready to offer my good offices." Ban reiterated the United Nations' longstanding stance against capital punishment "under any circumstances" and urged North Korea to comply with [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council resolutions]], which North Korea has frequently flouted.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.firstpost.com/world/ban-ki-moon-says-n-korea-execution-was-a-dramatic-surprise-1290145.html "Ban Ki Moon says N Korea execution was a dramatic surprise"], 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lebanese people in Germany''' include migrants from [[Lebanon]] to [[Germany]], as well as their descendants.

==History==
[[Image:Lebanon protest 2015 Berlin.JPG|thumb|Lebanese people in Germany express their support of the [[2015 Lebanese protests]] in [[Berlin]] at [[Alexanderplatz]], August 29, 2015]] 

Although there has been sporadic migration from the [[Middle East]] to Germany since the 20th century, the real growth of the German Lebanese population began in 1975, with the start of the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]] in Lebanon which drove thousands of people away. No concrete data exists on the religious affiliations, however it is commonly assumed that [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite Christian]]s, [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shia Muslim]]s, and [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]]s make up the majority of the Lebanese population in Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5076">[[File:Niqab_on_Tuareg.jpg|thumb|[[Tuareg]] man wearing a litham.]]
'''Litham''' ({{lang-ar|لِثَام|lithām }}, sometimes pronounced '''lifam''') is a mouth-[[veil]] which the [[Bedouin]], particularly men, have traditionally used to cover the lower part of their face.&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Björkman, W. | year= 2012 | title=Lit̲h̲ām |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_4672|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role and significance ==

The litham has served as protection from the dust and extremes of temperature characterizing the desert environment.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; In cases of blood feuds, it also served as protection against violence by making the wearer difficult to recognize.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Wearing of the litham is not viewed as a religious requirement, although it was apparently believed to provide magical protection against evil forces.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; It is included among the garments which pilgrims are forbidden to wear by the Islamic doctrine in the ritual state of ''[[ihram]]''.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;

== History and practice ==

Ancient African rock engravings depicting human faces with eyes but no mouth or nose suggest that the origins of litham are not only pre-Islamic but even pre-historic.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; The litham was commonly worn among the Berber [[Sanhaja]] tribes in north-west Africa.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Its use by the [[Almoravids]], who originated from a Sanhaja clan, gave it a political significance during their conquests in the 11th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; This practice gave rise to Almoravids being pejoratively nicknamed ''al-mulaththamun'' (the muffled ones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Murābiṭūn|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-1210|subscription=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Almohads]], who succeeded the Almoravids as the dominant dynasty in the North African region, opposed the practice of wearing the litham, claiming that it is forbidden for men to imitate women's dress, but they never managed to suppress its use.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; 

Among the [[Tuareg]], men wear the litham, also called ''[[Tagelmust|tagulmust]]'', while women go unveiled.&lt;ref name=twareg&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern World|editor= Peter N. Stearns|title=Twareg|publisher=Oxford University Press|authorlink1=Allen James Fromherz|author=Allen Fromherz|year=2008|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195176322.001.0001/acref-9780195176322-e-1626|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuareg boys start wearing the litham at the onset of puberty and the veil is regarded as a mark of manhood.&lt;ref name=twareg/&gt; It is considered improper for a man to appear unveiled in front of elders, especially those from his wife's family.&lt;ref name=twareg/&gt; The Tuareg litham is made of several pieces of Sudanese cloth which are sewn together to yield a strip about four yards long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-X0q2A8yoigC&amp;pg=PA78|page=78|title=The Conquest of the Sahara|author=Douglas Porch|publisher=Macmillan|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and folklore ==

A number of legends were invented to explain the custom of male veiling.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; According to one, the wearers of litham descended from members of the [[Umayyad]] family, who escaped to Africa disguised as women after the fall of the Umayyad dynasty, and never took off the veil.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; When one fell in battle and lost his litham, his friends could not recognize him until it was put back on.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; The word ''litham'' and its derivatives have been widely used in Arabic literature, in particular by the poets, who commonly employed puns between the general meaning of ''litham'' as veil and the verbal root ''lathama'', which means "to kiss".&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; In ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' women use the litham to disguise themselves as men.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The thousand and one nights, or, The Arabian nights' entertainments|pages=60,143|publisher=J. Murray|year=1847|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4-qwx8xT4eUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical dictionary ''Lisan al-Arab'' by [[Ibn Manzur]] treats  ''lifam'' as a separate word, describing it as a mouth veil worn by women.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;

'''Maynard F. Jordan Observatory''' is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] owned and operated by [[University of Maine]]. Its first telescope was installed at the university in 1901, and was upgraded during the creation of the Emera Astronomy Center in 2014.  It is located in [[Orono, Maine]], USA. It is the only public observatory in the state of Maine. Operated by the department of Physics and Astronomy, the eight-inch [[Alvan Clark &amp; Sons|Alvan Clark]] telescope is housed under a roll-off roof, next to the more modern PlaneWave CDK20 in its own dome.

The BiH National Minority Council is composed of 17 representatives of national minorities, one representative on behalf of each ethnic
minority.&lt;ref name=ACFC&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/16806d318e ACFC/SR/IV(2016)007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Minority Council of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] entity was established in March 2016.

The National Minority Council of the [[Republika Srpska]] entity was established in 2005.

The National Minority Council of [[Sarajevo Canton]] was established in 2012, with extended powers of legislative initiative.

== Associations ==

The Association of National Minorities of Republika Srpska (ANMRS) was established in 2003 as a voluntary and open non-partisan association of citizens. It gathers, as an umbrella organisations, 40 member associations of national minorities in Republika Srpska.&lt;ref name=ACFC/&gt;

== Education in minority languages ==
The Italian and Ukrainian languages are taught in one and four schools respectively in the town of [[Prnjavor, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Prnjavor]] (15 and 24 pupils in total in 2015).&lt;ref name=ACFC/&gt;

German, Russian and Italian languages are taught as foreign languages in several high schools throughout the country.&lt;ref name=ACFC/&gt;

Associations and embassies also organise several elective courses of minority languages as foreign languages.&lt;ref name=ACFC/&gt;

Several newsletters and bulletins are published periodically in minority languages, including four in Slovenian language, and one each in Hungarian (''Uy Dobos''), Macedonian (''Vinozito''), Italian (''Stella d'Italia'') and Czech language (''Banjalucki Krajani'')&lt;ref name=ACFC/&gt;

The answers to these and other questions on post-war problems are suggested in the Map-Plan - an outline of policy, illustrated with post-war New World Map- by Maurice Gomberg.

It shows a proposed political division of the world after World War II in the event of an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in which the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union as well as the Republic of China would rule. The map includes a [[manifesto]] describing a "New World Moral Order", along with quotes from Roosevelt's [[Four Freedoms]] speech.

Gomberg created the map as a personal project, and little else is known of him. The map has been highlighted by [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order conspiracy theorists]] who believe it represents some broader view of the US government, and has also been widely circulated online.&lt;ref&gt;http://groups.google.com/group/PoliticalForum/web/new-world-order&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120709164944/http://digg.com/world_news/Post_War_New_World_Order_Map?t=15783998 "Outline of post-war new world map" by Maurice Gomberg]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/13846978/1942-POSTWAR-NEW-WORLD-MAP-by-Maurice-Gomberg]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523072941/http://www.scribd.com/doc/13846978/1942-POSTWAR-NEW-WORLD-MAP-by-Maurice-Gomberg |date=May 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moon and pillbox - geograph.org.uk - 325948 crop.jpg|thumb|350px|A [[World War II]] hexagonal pillbox – on the bank of the [[Mells River]] at [[Lullington, Somerset]], England.]]

A '''pillbox''' is a type of [[blockhouse]], or concrete dug-in guard post, normally equipped with [[embrasure|loopholes]] through which to fire weapons. It is in effect a trench firing step hardened to protect against small-arms fire and grenades and raised to improve the field of fire.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term is disputed. It has been widely assumed to be a jocular reference to the perceived similarity of the fortifications to the cylindrical and hexagonal boxes in which medical pills were once sold.&lt;ref&gt;Hellis, John. [http://www.pillbox-study-group.org.uk/index.php/the-pillbox-study-group/why-pillbox/ "Why the name Pillbox?"] Pillbox Study Group&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems more likely that it originally alluded to [[pillar box]]es, with a comparison being drawn between the loophole on the pillbox and the letter-slot on the pillar box.&lt;ref name="Oldham18"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldham|2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is found in print in ''[[The Times]]'' on 2 August 1917, following the beginning of the [[Third Battle of Ypres]]; and in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' on 17 September 1917, following the German withdrawal onto the [[Hindenburg Line]]. Other unpublished occurrences have been found in [[War diary|war diaries]] and similar documents of about the same date; and in one instance, as "Pillar Box", as early as March 1916.&lt;ref name="Oldham18"/&gt;

==Description==
The concrete nature of pillboxes means that they are a feature of prepared positions. Some pillboxes were designed to be prefabricated and transported to their location for assembly. During World War I, Sir [[Ernest William Moir]] produced a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes&lt;ref name="NA-pillbox"&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers on:- Machine-gun pill-box designed by Mr. E. W. Moir, Munitions Council member|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1890565|website=National Archives|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof. Around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with blocks cast at [[Richborough]] in Kent) and sent to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="Oldham"&gt;{{harvnb|Oldham|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEHB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moir pillbox|url=http://sussexhistoryforum.co.uk/index.php?topic=1521.0|website=South East History Boards|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pillboxes are often [[Military camouflage|camouflaged]] in order to conceal their location and to maximize the element of surprise. They may be part of a trench system, form an interlocking line of defence with other pillboxes by providing covering fire to each other ([[defence in depth]]), or they may be placed to guard strategic structures such as bridges and jetties.

The French [[Maginot Line]] built between the world wars consisted of a massive [[bunker]] and tunnel complex, but as most of it was below ground little could be seen from the ground level. The exception were the concrete [[blockhouse]]s, [[gun turret]]s, pillboxes and [[cupola (military)|cupola]]s which were placed above ground to allow the garrison of the Maginot line to engage an attacking enemy.{{sfn|Schneider|Kitchen|2002|p=87}}

Between the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Abyssinian Crisis]] of 1936 and [[World War II]], the British built about 200 pillboxes on the island of [[Malta]] for defence in case of an Italian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guided tour of WWII defences|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20051205/local/guided-tour-of-wwii-defences.69984|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 100 pillboxes still exist, and most are found on the northeastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed nowadays as the authorities do not consider them to have any architectural or historic value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wartime pillbox at Salina being pulled down|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-04-10/news/wartime-pillbox-at-salina-being-pulled-down-4577918976/|accessdate=1 September 2014|work=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite heritage NGOs calling to preserve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leone Ganado|first1=Philip|title=WWII pillbox is not worth preserving, cultural watchdog says|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160830/local/wwii-pillbox-is-not-worth-preserving-cultural-watchdog-says.623544|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=30 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830155858/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20160830/local/wwii-pillbox-is-not-worth-preserving-cultural-watchdog-says.623544|archivedate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 28,000 [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications]] were constructed in England in 1940 as part of the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II]]. About 6,500 of these structures still survive.{{sfn|CBA staff}}

Pillboxes for the [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] were built before World War II in [[Czechoslovakia]] in defence against a German attack. None of these were actually used against their intended enemy during the German invasion, but some were used against the advancing Soviet armies in 1945. The [[Japan]]ese also made use of pillboxes in their fortifications of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]].

Pillboxes were hard to defeat and required artillery, anti-tank weapons or grenades to overcome.

[[File:Tribute Giraffe with Attendant.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Ming dynasty|Ming-era]] painting of a tribute giraffe, which was thought to be a Qilin by court officials, from Bengal]]
The '''qilin''' ({{IPAc-cmn|q|i|2|.|l|in|2}}; {{zh|c=麒麟}}), or '''kirin''' in Japanese, is a [[mythical]] hooved [[Chimera (mythology)|chimerical]] creature known in Chinese and other [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asian cultures]], said to appear with the imminent arrival or passing of a [[xian (Taoism)|sage]] or illustrious ruler.&lt;ref name=britannica1&gt;{{cite web|title=qilin (Chinese mythology)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/110049/qilin|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qilin is a specific type of the ''lin'' mythological family of one-horned beasts. 

==Origins==
The earliest references to the ''qilin'' are in the 5th century BC ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Classics/chunqiuzuozhuan.html Chinese Literature - Chunqiu-Zuozhuan 春秋左傳, Gongyangzhuan 公羊傳, Guliangzhuan 穀梁傳 (www.chinaknowledge.de)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://engine.cqvip.com/content/tu/98575x/2001/000/002/gc13_tu1_5337044.pdf 古建上的主要装饰纹样――麒麟 古建园林技术－作者:徐华铛&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201732/http://engine.cqvip.com/content/tu/98575x/2001/000/002/gc13_tu1_5337044.pdf |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''qilin'' made appearances in a variety of subsequent Chinese works of history and fiction, such as [[Fengshen Yanyi|Feng Shen Bang]]. [[Emperor Wu of Han]] apparently captured a live ''qilin'' in 122 BC, although [[Sima Qian]] was skeptical of this.&lt;ref&gt;[[:zh:s:史記/卷028]]{{Better source|date=January 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In legend, the ''qilin'' became a stylized representation of the [[giraffe]] in the [[Ming dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinanews.com.cn/news/2004year/2004-05-31/26/442822.shtml 此“麟”非彼“麟”专家称萨摩麟并非传说中麒麟]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pch.scu.edu.tw/blog/post/4/29 傳說中的聖獸－－麒麟]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of the qilin with giraffes began after [[Zheng He]]'s [[Treasure voyages|voyage to East Africa]] (landing, among other places, in modern-day [[Somalia]]). The Ming Dynasty bought giraffes from the [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somali merchants]] along with zebras, incense, and various other exotic animals.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel M. "The Emperor's Giraffe", ''Natural History'' Vol. 101, No. 12, December 1992 {{cite web|url=http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/WILSON09.ART |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202235051/http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/WILSON09.ART |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng He's fleet brought back two giraffes to [[Nanjing]], and they were referred to as "qilins".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sincehistory.twmail.org/13_4.pdf 傳世麒麟圖考察初稿 張之傑]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor proclaimed the giraffes magical creatures, whose capture signaled the greatness of his power.

The identification between the qilin and the giraffe is supported by some attributes of the qilin, including its vegetarianism and quiet nature. Its reputed ability to "walk on grass without disturbing it" may be related to the giraffe's long, thin legs. Also the qilin is described as having antlers like a deer and scales like a dragon or fish; since the giraffe has horn-like "[[ossicone]]s" on its head and a [[Tessellation|tessellated]] coat pattern that looks like scales it is easy to draw an analogy between the two creatures. The identification of qilin with giraffes has had lasting influence: even today, the same word is used for the mythical animal and the giraffe in both Korean and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, J. T.:" The Mythic Chinese Unicorn"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The ''qilin'' may be described or depicted in a variety of ways. 

''Qilin'' generally have [[Chinese dragon]]-like features. Most notably their heads, eyes with thick eyelashes, manes that always flow upward and beards. The body is fully or partially scaled and often shaped like an ox, deer, or horse. They are always shown with cloven hooves. In modern times, the depictions of ''qilin'' have often fused with the Western concept of unicorns.

The Chinese dragon has [[antler]]s, so it is most common to see ''qilin'' with antlers. Dragons in China are also most commonly depicted as golden, therefore the most common depictions of qilin are also golden, but are not limited to just gold, and can be any color of the rainbow, multicolored, and various colors of fur or hide.

The ''qilin'' are depicted throughout a wide range of Chinese art also with parts of their bodies on fire, but not always. Sometimes they have feathery features or decorations, fluffy curly tufts of hair like Ming Dynasty horse art on various parts of the legs from fetlocks to upper legs, or even with decorative fish-like fins as decorative embellishments, or [[Asian carp|carp fish]] [[Barbel (anatomy)|whiskers]], or even carp fish-like dragon scales.

Qilin are often depicted as somewhat bejeweled, or as brilliant as jewels themselves, like Chinese dragons. They are often associated in colors with [[Wu Xing|the elements]], precious metals, stars, and gem stones. But, ''qilin'' can also be earthy and modest browns or [[Earth tone|earth-tones]].  
It is said their [[wikt:auspicious|auspicious]] voice sounds like the tinkling of bells, chimes, and the wind.

According to [[Chinese mythology|Taoist mythology]], although they can look fearsome, ''qilin'' only punish the wicked, thus there are several variations of court trials and judgements based on qilin divinely knowing whether a defendant was good or evil, and guilty or innocent, in ancient lore and stories.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhist]] influenced depictions, they will refuse to walk upon grass for fear of harming a single blade, and thus are often depicted walking upon the clouds or the water. As they are divine and peaceful creatures, their diets do not include flesh. They take great care when they walk to never tread on a living creature, and appear only in areas ruled by a wise and benevolent leader, which can include a household. They can become fierce if a pure person is threatened by a malicious one, spouting flames from their mouths and exercising other fearsome powers that vary from story to story.

Legends tell that qilin have appeared in the [[Chinese gardens|garden]] of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] and in the capital of [[Emperor Yao]]. Both events bore testimony to the benevolent nature of the rulers. It has been told in legends that the birth of the great sage [[Confucius]] was foretold by the arrival of a qilin.&lt;ref name=britannica1/&gt;

Qilin are thought to be a symbol of luck, good omens, protection, prosperity, success, and longevity by the Chinese.
Qilin are also a symbol of fertility, and often depicted in decorations as bringing a baby to a family.

Some stories{{which|date=February 2017}} state that qilin are sacred pets (or familiars) of the deities.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Therefore, in the hierarchy of dances performed by the Chinese ([[lion dance]], [[dragon dance]], etc.), they rank highly; third only to the dragon and phoenix who are the highest.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In the qilin dance, movements are characterized by fast, powerful strokes of the head. The Qilin Dance is often regarded as a hard dance to perform due to the weight of the head, the stances involved, and the emphasis on sudden bursts of energy ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|法勁}}}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{lang|zh|法劲}}, &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''fǎjìn'').

===As "unicorn"===
Qilin (麒麟) is often translated into English as "unicorn" as it can sometimes be depicted as having a [[Unicorn horn|single horn]], although this is misleading as qilin may also be depicted as having two horns. A separate word ({{zh-tsp|t=獨角獸|s=独角兽|p=Dújiǎoshòu}}) is used in modern Chinese for "unicorns". A number of different Chinese mythical creatures can be depicted with a single horn, and a qilin, even if depicted with one horn, would be called a "one-horned qilin" in Chinese, not a "unicorn".

It is because of the whimsical, supernatural, mythical, mystical, and religious similarities in antiquity to the Western unicorns that the Chinese government minted coins in silver and gold several times depicting both the qilin and the Western Unicorn together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces89740.html|title=5 Yuan, China|publisher=Numista|website=en.numista.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variations ==

[[File:Qilin-shaped incense burner 1 CAC.JPG|thumb|A Qing dynasty qilin-shaped incense burner]]
There are variations in the appearance of the qilin, even in historical China, owing to [[Culture|cultural]] differences between dynasties and regions.

=== China ===

==== Jin ====
During the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], the qilin was depicted as wreathed in flame and smoke, with a dragon-like head, scales, and the body of a powerful hooved beast such as a horse.

==== Ming ====
In the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), the qilin was represented as an [[ox]]en-hoofed animal with a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-like head surmounted by a pair of horns and flame-like head ornaments.

==== Qing ====
The qilin of China's subsequent [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911) was a fanciful animal. Depictions of the qilin show a creature with the head of a [[dragon]], the [[antler]]s of a [[deer]], the skin and scales of a [[fish]], the [[hoof|hooves]] of an [[ox]] and [[tail]] of a [[lion]].

=== Korea ===
''Girin'', ''Kirin'', or 기린 is the [[Korean language|Korean]] form of "qilin". It is described as a maned creature with the torso of a [[deer]], an [[ox]] tail with the [[hoof|hooves]] of a [[horse]]. The qilin in Korean art were initially depicted as more deer-like, however over time they have transformed into more horse-like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://navercast.naver.com/contents.nhn?contents_id=7922&amp;path=|458|539|&amp;leafId=806 기린 : 네이버캐스트]&lt;/ref&gt; They were one of the four divine creatures along with the [[Korean dragon|dragon]], [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] and [[turtle]]. Qilin were extensively used in Korean royal and Buddhist arts.

In modern Korean, the term "girin" is used for "[[giraffe]]".

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, the Qílín is known as 'Gilen' (Thai; กิเลน), and is a member of the pantheon of Thai Himapant forest mythical animals. It is most probable that the Gilen was introduced into the pantheon under the influence of the [[Tai Yai]] who came down from Southern China to settle in Siam in ancient times, and the legend was probably incorporated into the Himapant legends of Siam in this manner. The Gilen is a mixture of various animals, which come from differing elemental environments, representing elemental magical forces present within each personified creature. Many of the Himapant animals actually represent gods and devas of the Celestial Realms, and bodhisattvas, who manifest as personifications which represent the true nature of each creature deity through the symbolism of the various body parts amalgamated into the design of the Mythical creature.&lt;ref name="Paetch Payatorn riding Gilen Himapant Lion"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://buddhistamulet.net | title=Taep Payatorn Riding Qilin Himapant Lion Hlang Yant – Nuea Pong Maha Sanaeh Luan – Ajarn Warut – Wat Pong Wonaram | publisher=Buddha Magic Multimedia &amp; Publications | accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
Kirin is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] form of "qilin", which has also come to be used in the modern Japanese word for a [[giraffe]]. Japanese art tends to depict the kirin as more deer-like than in [[Chinese art]]. Alternatively, it is depicted as a dragon shaped like a deer, but with an ox's tail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffis|first=William Elliot|title=The Religions of Japan|publisher=Bibliobazaar|date=October 2007|pages=39|isbn=978-1-4264-9918-0|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f8oc2uzD6GgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Kirin+tail#v=onepage&amp;q=Kirin%20tail&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of a lion's tail. The [[Kirin Brewery]] Company, Ltd., is named after the animal and uses a picture of one in its labels.&lt;ref name="Kirin Ichiban"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kirinichiban.kirin.co.jp/history/index.html | title=The Kirin: a mythological beast that portends happiness | publisher=Kirin Brewing company | accessdate=September 28, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615172146/http://www.kirinichiban.kirin.co.jp/history/index.html | archivedate=June 15, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also often portrayed as partially [[unicorn]]-like in appearance, but with a backwards curving horn.

In the Post-[[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] Chinese hierarchy of mythological animals, the qilin is ranked as the third most powerful creature (after the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] and [[Fenghuang|phoenix]]), but in Japan, the kirin occupies the top spot. This is following the style of the ancient Chinese, as qilin was ranked higher than the dragon or phoenix before the Qin dynasty. During the Zhou dynasty, the qilin was ranked the highest, the phoenix ranked second, and the dragon the third.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

=== Vietnam ===
In Vietnam, the Qilin is referred to as the 'Kỳ lân Trung Hoa', or simplified as 'Kỳ lân'. The origins of the Kỳ lân is descended from the Chinese Qilin, and shares many similar features, such as the head of a dragon or tiger, mane of a lion, the hooves of an ox or horse, the tail of a lion or ox, scales of a fish, and it can have either 1 or 2 horns or antlers.

==Cultural representations==
[[File:Qilin in sancai tuhui.jpg|thumb|A Ming Dynasty depiction of the qilin from the ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'', published in 1609]]
The qilin has been frequently depicted in works of literature and art:

* In [[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', there is a section on "The Unicorn of China".
* In [[Takashi Miike]]'s ''[[The Great Yokai War]]'', the hero is bitten during a street festival by the dancer's kirin head.

* In the video game series [[Monster Hunter]], the Kirin are classified as one of the Elder Dragons. Resembling a unicorn covered in scales, they are extremely agile and can summon lightning at will.   
* In ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]'', Kirin are secluded creatures that live atop the Peaks of Peril. They appear unicorn-like, but with the scales, manes and tufts of fur associated with the traditional image of Kirins, and with very stylized horns.  The show's version of Kirins also have the ability to morph into "Niriks", beings of fire and vengeance, when they turn angry.  At the time of the show's main characters' first encounter with the Kirin, they had taken a magic enforced vow of silence after having burned down their own village when an argument led to a fight between Niriks.
* The [[Kirin Company| Kirin Company, Limited]] is a brewery company named after kirin, prominently featuring a kirin in its logo.

'''Robert Talbott Miller III''' or '''Bob Miller''' (April 5, 1910 – January 1999) was an [[United States|American]] citizen who worked in the United States [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] during [[World War II]].  He was alleged to be part of the Soviet [[espionage]] group known as the "[[Jacob Golos|Golos ring]]".

==Biography==
Miller was born April 5, 1910, in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], and lived in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. In August 1934, he moved to [[Moscow]] and worked as a correspondent for the ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press|Chattanooga News]]'' until 1937. In Moscow, Miller met and married his wife, [[Jenny Levy Miller|Jenny Levy]], an American.  In 1937, Miller became press agent for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] government.  In 1939, the Millers moved to [[New York City]], and Miller became President of the [[Hemisphere News Service]] and editor of its weekly publication, ''Hemisphere''.  [[Jack Fahy]], another suspected spy for the Soviet Union, was Vice President and Treasurer. Miller was known to be meeting with [[Jacob Golos]] as early as February 1941 in New York.  Sometime that same year, the Millers relocated to [[Washington D.C.]] so that he could take employment as an analyst for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) in the Department of Commerce at a good salary. He later became Director of the Division of Reports of the OCIAA.  About this time, Miller allegedly began supplying information to [[Elizabeth Bentley]] for the Golos network.  Miller had access to information from the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] (ONI), Army G-2 (Intelligence), the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS), and the [[FBI]] concerning [[Latin America]]n affairs.  The material Miller allegedly provided Bentley for transmission to [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet intelligence]] always concerned [[Communist]] or Russian activities in [[Latin America]].

In September 1941, the Hemisphere News Service moved to Washington D.C. and became the [[Export Information Bureau]], managed by [[Joseph Gregg]], and received a contract to do exclusive research work for the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.  At the same time, Robert Miller became a research analyst with the OCIAA.  The Export Information Bureau was subsequently absorbed into the CIAA.

In December 1941, Miller was interviewed by D.M. Ladd of the FBI about a request to investigate several individuals and organizations for OCIAA, including an organization called the "Society for Pan-American Confraternity".  In February 1942, at the request of Undersecretary [[James Forrestal]], FBI Special Agent Jerry Doyle had lunch with John Nitze, a former employee of Forrestal.  Nitze was accompanied by Miller, who was described as being in charge of intelligence for the OCIAA.  Nitze explained that Miller provided intelligence reports for both the [[Board of Economic Warfare]] (BEW) and the OCIAA which were prepared from information supplied by the FBI, Office of Naval Intelligence and Army G-2.

In July 1944, Miller transferred to the Near Eastern Division of the United States [[Department of State]] and handled confidential matters between the [[United States]] and the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].  By August 1944, it was established Miller had a connection with [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster|Greg Silvermaster]], head of the Silvermaster group.  Miller was also a close associate of [[Maurice Halperin]], who worked for the OSS, State Department, and Soviet intelligence.  [[Charles Flato]] of the [[Board of Economic Warfare|Office of Economic warfare]] and the [[Foreign Economic Administration]] was also one of Miller's contacts.

Miller resigned from the State Department in December 1946. According to [[Anatoly Gorsky]]'s memo, "Failures in the U.S.A. (1938–1948)," December 1948: in [[Alexander Vassiliev]]'s Notes from the KGB Archive. Miller's codename was "Mirage." "Mirage," is one of the codenames in The [[Venona]] Papers that was not identified by other sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5503">[[Sami people|Sámi]] institutional symbols are of relatively new origin, as the [[Sami government|Sámi political institutions]] themselves are quite new. The symbols generally draw inspiration from old ornamental traditions such as [[duodji]] and the "runes" of the traditional [[Sami drum|shaman's drums]]. The symbols generally don't follow [[heraldry|the rules of tincture]], as the "sámi national colours" are traditionally placed colour on colour.

== Sámi flag ==
''See: [[Sami flag]]''
[[File:Sami flag.svg|250px|right|Sami flag]]
Though the highest ranking symbol, the flag does not symbolize any particular institution. It is, however, as of 1986 the official flag of all Sámi in all countries and a recognized flag in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[[:no:Sameflagget#Det samiske flagget]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is used by most important Sámi institutions. The flag is a combination of an old, unofficial flag and an often-used sun/moon symbol of the shaman's drum. It is inspired by a mythological poem claiming the Sámi to be "children of the Sun".

With the creation of this flag, the "national colours" of the Sámi were defined as red, green, yellow and blue. All of these are heraldic colours, except yellow which is a metal ("ore") in heraldic terms.

== Pan-Sámi political structures ==
=== Sámi Parliamentary Council ===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

=== Sámi Council ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Samicouncillogo.jpg|100px|right|Symbol of the Sámi Council as seen on saamicouncil.net]] --&gt;
The [[Saami Council|Sámi Council]], which organizes Sámi [[NGO]]s at the international level has a symbol that predates{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  the Sámi flag. In appearance it is similar to the arppa - a chain of rings used together with shaman's drums to predict the future. It symbolizes unity between Sámi of the four states.

== Sámi parliaments ==
=== Sámi Parliament of Norway ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SamedignorgUNNAN.JPG|100px|right|Symbol of the Norwegian Sámi Parliament as seen on samediggi.no]] --&gt;
The logo of the [[Sámi Parliament of Norway]] draws the least inspiration from the Sámi flag. It represents the parliament building seen from above, with the main corpus marked in grey and the hall of parliament in red. However, the building is designed to suggest the sun/moon symbol when seen from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://samediggi.no/artikkel.aspx?AId=1&amp;MId1=1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805111250/http://www.samediggi.no/artikkel.aspx?AId=1&amp;MId1=1 |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sámi Parliament of Sweden ===
The logo of the [[Sámi Parliament of Sweden]] features a circle in the four Sámi colours. The circle is striped in resemblance of a shaman's drum's sun-symbol. Within the circle there is a runic symbol resembling an arrow pointing southwest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samediggi.se/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sámi Parliament of Finland ===
The logo of the [[Sámi Parliament of Finland]] features a red circle with a yellow line at the bottom (inside the circle) and four blue lines radiating from it - symbolizing the sun. The four lines represent the four Sámi groups of Finland, and the three colours are that of the first Sámi flag. The green colour was originally added to represent the South Sámi, who are not native to Finland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samediggi.fi/index.php?lang=fi&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian Sámi Organs ==
The elected [http://saamisups.ucoz.ru/ Council of Plenipotentiary Representatives of the Sámi of Murmansk Province] uses a symbol heavily inspired by the flag: two reindeer horns joined like a crescent, the upper half red and the lower half blue, between the halves are two stripes in yellow and green. The official [https://web.archive.org/web/20091113161525/http://www.gov-murman.ru/natpers/centre/ Centre for Indigenous People in Murmansk Province], under which the official Council of Indigenous Peoples under the [Provincial] Government operates, uses a logo also inspired by the flag: a circle, left half blue and right half red, at the centre of which is a brown [[lavvu|lávvu]], a blue line symbolizing [[water]], and a multicoloured line symbolizing the [[Aurora Borealis]], the colours of the latter being from left to right red, yellow, green and blue.

== Other official Sámi institutions ==
=== Finnmark Estate ===
''Finnmárkuopmodat'', the autonomous entity established by the [[Finnmark Act]] has a logo that according to the entity's website "gets it colours from the Sámi and the Norwegian flag, as a symbol that the Finnmark Estate feels related to and responsible for both Sámi, [[kven people|kven]]s and [[Norwegian people|ethnic Norwegians]]. (...) The circular shape... refers both to the Sámi flag's sun-symbol and to the solid and safe envelopment of a circle. (...) It is opened up to allow the [[Aurora Borealis|Northern Lights]] a gateway into the [[Norwegian flag|Norwegian]] and the Sámi flag's colours."&lt;ref&gt;https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.fefo.no/Finnmarkseiendommen/artikler/logo.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.fefo.no/index.asp%3Fstrurl%3D1003768i%26topExpand%3D%26subExpand%3D&amp;usg=__lr-xzJklhPqdysVXGarhkccwOqs=&amp;h=320&amp;w=472&amp;sz=41&amp;hl=en&amp;start=6&amp;um=1&amp;tbnid=-YkCV6mbGxVIUM:&amp;tbnh=87&amp;tbnw=129&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Dsamisk%2Bsolsymbol%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18626">'''Strategic communication''' can mean either [[communication|communicating]] a [[concept]], a [[business process|process]], or [[Data management|data]] that satisfies a long term [[strategy|strategic]] goal of an organization by allowing facilitation of [[project management|advanced planning]], or communicating over long distances usually using [[Telecommunication|international telecommunications]] or dedicated [[global network]] assets to coordinate actions and activities of operationally significant [[commerce|commercial]], [[government|non-commercial]] and [[military]] [[business unit|business]] or [[Military unit|combat]] and [[logistics|logistic]] subunits. It can also mean the related function within an organization, which handles internal and external communication processes.  Strategic communication can also be used for [[political warfare]].

==Definition of strategic communication==
Strategic communication refers to policy-making and guidance for consistent information activity within an organization and between organizations. Equivalent business management terms are: integrated (marketing) communication, organizational communication, corporate communication, institutional communication, etc. (see paragraph on 'Commercial Application' below).

In the U.S. government context, strategic communication has been defined as "Focused United States Government efforts to understand and engage key audiences to create, strengthen, or preserve conditions favorable for the advancement of United States Government interests, policies, and objectives through the use of coordinated programs, plans, themes, messages, and products synchronized with the actions of all instruments of national power."&lt;ref&gt;Joint Publication 1-02: "Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms", Washington D.C., 12 April 2001 (as amended through 17 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategic communication management could be defined as the systematic planning and realization of information flow, communication, media development and image care in a long-term horizon. It conveys deliberate message(s) through the most suitable media to the designated audience(s) at the appropriate time to contribute to and achieve the desired long-term effect. Communication management is process creation. It has to bring three factors into balance: the message(s), the media channel(s) and the audience(s).&lt;ref name='Bockstette'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_Publications/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf |title=Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques|last=Bockstette|first=Carsten |date=December 2008 |publisher=George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view of strategic communication is offered by Steve Tatham of the UK Defence Academy. He argues that whilst it is desirable to bound and coordinate communications together - particularly from governments or the military - it should be regarded in a much more fundamental manner than simply process. The 'informational effect' should be placed at the very epi-centre of command and that all action must be calibrated against that effect - including the evaluation of 2nd and 3rd order effects.  This is, he argues, proper Strategic Communication (communication singular — an abstract noun) whilst the actual process of communicating (which include Target Audience Analysis, evaluation of conduits, measurements of effect etc.) — is Strategic Communications (plural).&lt;ref&gt;https://independent.academia.edu/SteveTatham&lt;/ref&gt;

In the August 2008 paper, "DoD Principles of Strategic Communication," [[Robert T. Hastings, Jr.]], acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, described strategic communication as "the synchronization of images, actions and words to achieve a desired effect."

Communication is strategic when it is completely consistent with the organisation mission, vision, values and when it is able to enhance the strategic positioning and competitiveness between their competitors. It is important to understand the concept of communication strategy, it should be seen from the organization’s perspective and no one else beside them. As a result of this communication, strategic communication should follow ‘The nature of organisational communication in general, and strategic communication in particular, is defined as the purposeful use of communication by an organisation to fulfill its mission’ stated by (Hallahan et al., 2007). Therefore, the Strategic Communications Framework should be lay out to aim the objectives of communicating to the audience/organisation. The deliberate application of the specific content will help achieve the business goal clearly. While communication is something that does happen in the organisation, businesses that take steps to implement sound strategies impacting the effectiveness of their business communications can achieve measurable results. According to Mulhern(2009), Technological advancement have been a huge factor in business meaning that information can be communicated through many diverse channels and media like the internet and through ads. Technology have been rapidly growing throughout the year pretty fast, accelerating communication that allow customers to connect and communicate with others. This will make it easier for them to reach to each other in a traditional communication way that suit the demand of their needs. ‘These changes mean that marketers are in a far more challenging competitive environment in attempting to fulfil customers wants and needs, while simultaneously seeking to develop long-term relationships’( Mulhern, 2009). Having changes in communication will help communication goals, organisation, and communication channels. This will have an effect of measuring the effectiveness of the communication tactics used in a business for their audience. To start a business no matter how small it is, communication strategy should be a goal to start with and it will indicate the future of the business. A business that communicate with their employees about benefit options will have increased the level of trust between them.

==Application objectives==
Strategic communication provides a conceptual umbrella that enables organizations to integrate their disparate messaging efforts. It allows them to create and distribute communications that, while different in style and purpose, have an inner coherence. This consistency can, in some instances, foster an echo chamber that reinforces the organizational message and brand. At minimum, it prevents contradictory, confusing messaging to different groups across all media platforms.

=== Strategic planning ===
To have an object, the first thing to do is have a plan for the business to communicate how the business is formed and to see how strong its core is. Ensure that alignment with the organization’s understanding of where it is currently at.  An approach that could be used to determine the current state of the objective, is to do a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. When using a SWOT analysis, the strengths and weaknesses must be realistic.  This is to help make improvements or adjustments that were not so good. The analysis will help get a better understanding of the business and will help plan and make the objectives more solid because it shows the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats the business is facing.  This helps decide where the business is today, and where it will be in the future.
Planning is a continuous process of research and analysis, task analysis, execution, and assessment. Success in this process requires diligent and continual analysis, and assessment being fed back into planning and actions.&lt;ref&gt;Commander’s Handbook for Strategic Communication and Communication Strategy, US Joint Forces Command, Suffolk, VA. 2010, p 109&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Talk to key stakeholders. ===
Have interviews with the customers to learn their priorities and what goals they want to achieve with the organization. Having a good understanding of the business issues, this will allow the organisation to offer effective solutions that will help the objective. Ask questions to see what the customer’s aim is, with the main goal to focus on what needs to be achieved and done and not what he/ or she wants. ‘Sustainability calls for a value chain approach, whereby firms need to take wider responsibility and collaborate with a range of stakeholders to ensure that unsustainable practices are addressed’ (Scandelius, &amp; Cohen,2015).

=== Develop actionable objectives ===
Objectives should have a specific end points to provide an indicator of success. Kotler et al., (2013) stated by understanding the consumer and the marketplace, he or she can design a marketing strategy. To have an understanding to what is happening around the organisation will ensure that planning the marketing strategy will be easy because the vision is there and making sure the objectives are SMART. Objectives are the intended goals of a business campaigns, to show what is achievable. The objectives are effective when using SMART goals: they need to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. Have assignments for individuals or groups so the responsibilities for each of these objectives are already set and no adjustments are needed because they have been assigned to a specific person or group.  The responsibility is in their hands. This is to indicate the specific individual or group have a direct preliminary objective they are assigned to. They will need to develop a range of possible strategies and tactics to achieve the objectives given to them.

=== Develop and prioritise potential strategies and tactics ===
Brainstorm a list of potential strategies achievable for each of the objectives given out by the business and its customers, and have tactics that will support these strategies and objectives. Gather as a team to discuss the merits of each proposed strategy to the organisation.  The discussion must be about the strategies that will most likely be able to be used and those that are unlikely to be used. Some strategies will not be achievable, will be difficult or no solution will be available for it so these will be crossed of the list. This shortens the list and helps to round up the best strategies left to be used. Collectively decide which strategies and tactics are going to be pursued to provide a clear objective for the business. The main focus is to achieve the objectives that were given out by the organisation.

=== Metrics, timelines and responsibilities ===
Have the detail behind those strategies and tactics name out so that there is a clear objective and what is needed to be focus on'''.''' Explain how it will be successful, how it is measured, the time frame and who will be responsible. To ensure that everything is successfully plan out and the success of these strategies and tactics. To do this planning wisely is a key part, planning does not only help a business achieve the objective but also help with communication within the group. Everyone will be assigned to a responsibility so that these strategies and tactics are meet.

==Defense application==
{{main article|Propaganda}}
The recently approved NATO Policy on Strategic Communication defines Strategic Communication as "the coordinated and appropriate use of NATO communications activities and capabilities – Public Diplomacy, Military Public Affairs, Information Operations and Psychological Operations, as appropriate – in support of Alliance policies, operations and activities, and in order to advance NATO's aims" (SG(2009)0794). "It is important to underline that Strategic Communication is first and foremost a process that supports and underpins all efforts to achieve the Alliance's objectives; an enabler that guides and informs our decisions, and not an organization
in itself. It is for this reason that Strategic Communication considerations should be integrated into the earliest planning phases - communication activities being a consequence of that planning" (MCM-0164-2009).

==Commercial application==
Strategic Communication is communication aligned with the company's overall strategy, to enhance its strategic positioning.&lt;ref&gt;Argenti, Paul A. / Howell, Robert A. / Beck, Karen A.: "The Strategic Communication Imperative", Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) / Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, MIT Sloan Management Review (SMR) Vol. 46, No. 3, Spring 2005, pp.83-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept development and experimentation (CD&amp;E)==
Strategic communication is currently subject to multinational CD&amp;E,&lt;ref&gt;Peter E. Westenkirchner (Bundeswehr Transformation Centre): Framework Concept "Integrated Communication in Multinational Coalition Operations within a Comprehensive Approach" (request copy at: peterwestenkirchner@bundeswehr.org)&lt;/ref&gt; led by the military, because communication is always an indispensable part of crisis management and compliance strategies. Across the spectrum of missions and broadly covering all levels of involvement in a civil-military, comprehensive approach context, the function of Strategic Communication and its military tool for implementation – Information Operations – have evolved and are still under development, in particular concerning their exact delineation of responsibilities and the integration of non-military and non-coalition actors.

Three major lines of development are acknowledged as state of the art, with practical impact on current crisis management operations and/or multinational interoperability: (1) U.S. national developments, which one can argue have resulted in the most mature concepts for both Strategic Communication and Information Operations so far; (2) NATO concept development, which in the case of Strategic Communication is very much driven by current mission requirements (such as ISAF in Afghanistan), but also has benefitted much from multinational CD&amp;E in the case of Information Operations; and (3) multinational CD&amp;E projects such as the U.S.-led Multinational Experiment (MNE) series and the Multinational Information Operations Experiment (MNIOE), led by Germany.

Intensive discussions involving civil and military practitioners of Strategic Communication and Information Operations - with a view on existing national and NATO approaches to Strategic Communication, and current best practice - have questioned whether a new approach and definition of Strategic Communication really is required. Consequently, a reorientation of CD&amp;E efforts was suggested, focussing now on the theme of "Integrated Communication", which better reflects the shared baseline assessment with a broader scope, including but not limited to Strategic Communication:

* the ineffective top-down approach to communication (mission-specific, strategic-political guidance for information activities; information strategy; corporate vision; shared narrative) and
* the insufficient horizontal and vertical integration of communication (cohesion of a coalition; corporate identity; cultural awareness; communication by words and deeds - the "say-do-gap"; involvement of non-coalition actors - participatory communication).

This change also should prevent false expectations of potential customers of resulting concepts who currently are reluctant to engage in CD&amp;E on the widely implemented subject of Strategic Communication.

The '''Tampuan''' (also spelled Tompuan or Tampuon) are an indigenous ethnic group living in northeast [[Cambodia]]. Numbering about 31,000, the Tampuan people live in the mountainous Southern and Western portions of the Cambodian province of [[Ratanakiri]]. They have their own language of the [[Mon–Khmer]] language family.

Tampuans, along with the other Mon-Khmer groups of the mountains, are referred to as [[Khmer Loeu]] ("Upper Khmer") by the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] majority. In English, [[Degar|montagnards]], a designation given to all hilltribes in the former [[French Indochina]] is often used. Though historically their language has been without a writing system, in the last ten years an [[NGO]] has overseen the creation of a writing system, based on the [[Cambodian alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gamma.sil.org/asia/ldc/parallel_papers/he_chey_chap.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728022631/http://gamma.sil.org/asia/ldc/parallel_papers/he_chey_chap.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; However, fewer than 80% of Tampuans are literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/2005/11/828487.shtml|title=Independent Media Center |website=Indymedia.org|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tampuan Children.JPG|thumb|Tampuan Children, from [[Ratanakiri]], Cambodia]]

==Culture==
The Tampuan people are a mountain people, living in communal villages that range from 100 to 400 inhabitants. The villages are often laid out in a square, with a communal house (Tampuan: {{IPA|/raoŋ/}}), in the center. Today many Tampuan villages have a communal well, [[volleyball]] court, or rice mill in the center as well. In addition to a village home, most Tampuans have a second residence on their farm.

Houses are built on three- to 6-foot-tall ({{convert|3|to|6|ft|m|disp=output only}}) stilts to catch cool breezes. The walls, floor, roof and doors are made of split woven bamboo. Normally, houses are rectangular in shape, averaging five meters by three meters. Today, many rich Tampuans build wooden houses with corrugated steel roofs, a mark of luxury. In some areas, Tampuans live in communal longhouses that can be up to {{convert|200|ft}} in length.

===Family structure===
Tampuans have a [[matrilineal]] system of marriage, with the family name and inheritance passing through the mother’s side of the family. Normally, Tampuans marry between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. In accordance with tradition, the young couple lives with and serves the family of the bride for three years, and then moves to serve the grooms family for an additional three years. At this point, the young couple is considered to be of age, capable of starting their own farm. [[Bigamy]] is tolerated but not common.
	
The average married Tampuan woman bears six to eight children in her lifetime, but due to high infant mortality rates and poor medical care, fewer than six usually survive to adulthood.

===Diet===
The Tampuan diet consists almost entirely of rice, supplemented by fish or stewed vegetables. Though Tampuans may raise chickens, pigs, dogs, cows, and water buffalo for food, the meat is rarely eaten apart from an animistic religious sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsecurity.gov.kh/docs/ENG/fulldoc-Food%20Taboos%20and%20Eating%20Ratanakiri-Eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214073525/http://www.foodsecurity.gov.kh/docs/ENG/fulldoc-Food%20Taboos%20and%20Eating%20Ratanakiri-Eng.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Tampuans also use [[crossbow]]s or guns to hunt wild boars, pheasants, deer and small rodents. Bugs and ants are often consumed as snacks.&lt;ref name="foodsecurity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsecurity.gov.kh/docs/ENG/Indigenous%20Food%20Diary%20Ratanakiri-ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722132235/http://www.foodsecurity.gov.kh/docs/ENG/Indigenous%20Food%20Diary%20Ratanakiri-ENG.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Tampuans hold a number of foods to be taboo, according to the clan into which one is born.&lt;ref name="foodsecurity" /&gt;

==Agriculture==
Nearly all Tampuans are [[subsistence farmer]]s, practicing a form of rotational [[slash and burn agriculture]]. The land surrounding the village is communally owned, with each village member planting on his designated section. When the nutrients on a particular plot of land are depleted, usually after two or three years, a new plot is cleared, burned, and prepared for planting. The previous plot is left to lie fallow for a period of years. The vast majority of Tampuans plant dry-land rice.

==Religion==
Tampuans are [[animism|animists]], believing that spirits inhabit all things. Spirits, and especially evil spirits, must be appeased through animal sacrifices. Violating the evil spirit’s commands causes sickness. Mediums and [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcerers]] are common, and are paid to speak the will of the spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/hosted/tampuan/|title=Indigenous Peoples of the World — The Tampuan|first=Ray|last=Waddington|website=Peoplesoftheworld.org|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
The Tampuans are a very musical people. They learn from a young age to play fiddles, stringed banjos, [[drum]]s, [[flute]]s, and gongs. [[Gong]]s are their most important instruments. The gongs are made of hammered bronze, and consist of a set of five for rhythm and another set of eight for the melody. Playing gongs is a communal affair; thirteen men play gongs and two play percussion. Often the gongs are accompanied by dancing. Traditionally, men play instruments and women sing.

The '''Tonga language''' of [[Mozambique]], or ''Gitonga'' (spelled ''Guitonga'' in Portuguese) is a [[Bantu language]] spoken along the southern coast of the country. Often thought to be closest to [[Chopi language|Chopi]] to its south, the two languages have only a 44% lexical similarity.

{{Turkish people}}
'''Turks of Western Thrace''' ({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|Batı Trakya Türkleri}}}}, {{lang-el|{{italics correction|Τούρκοι της Δυτικής Θράκης}}}}) are [[Turkish people|ethnic Turks]] who live in [[Western Thrace]], in the province of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] in [[Northern Greece]].

According to the Greek census of 1991, there were approximately 50,000 Turks in Western Thrace, out of the approximately 98,000 strong [[Muslim minority of Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs|title=The Muslim Minority of Greek Thrace|url=http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/musminen.htm|accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimate the size of the Turkish community between 90,000 and 120,000.&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=i"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=i}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Levinson|1998|loc=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Turks of Western Thrace are not to be confused with [[Pomaks]] nor with [[Muslim Roma]] people of the same region, counting 35% and 15% of the Muslim minority respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/MFA/foreign/musmingr.htm Υπουργείο Εξωτερικών, Υπηρεσία Ενημέρωσης: Μουσουλμάνικη μειονότητα Θράκης]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Greek Helsinki Monitor]]: [http://www.greekhelsinki.gr/bhr/english/organizations/ghm_mrgg_religious_freedom_2002.rtf Religious freedom in Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the multiethnic character of the [[Muslim minority of Greece]], which includes Turks, Pomaks and Roma Muslims, the [[Government of Greece]] does not refer to it by a specific ethnic background, nor does recognize any of these ethnicities, including the Turks, as separate ethnic minority in Western Thrace,&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=i"/&gt; instead referring to the whole Muslim minority on religious grounds, as the "Muslim Minority of Western Thrace" or "Greek Muslims". This is in accordance with the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] to which Greece, along with [[Turkey]], is a signature member. The Lausanne Treaty, along with the [[Greek Constitution]] and the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], enshrines the fundamental rights of the Turks and other ethnic groups of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] and the obligations towards them.

== History ==
{{See also|Ottoman Greece|Provisional Government of Western Thrace|Population exchange between Greece and Turkey}}
Parts of Western Thrace were overrun by the expanding [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1354 and remained in Ottoman control until 1913. At this year, the Turkish community outnumbered the Greek community four to one and owned close to 84% of the land. By August 31, 1913 the Turks of Western Thrace had formed the first 'Turkish republic', the [[Provisional Government of Western Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ataöv|1992|loc=90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was taken over by the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] on October 25, 1913, which had been victorious in the [[First Balkan War]]. [[France]] occupied the area at the end of the [[First World War]], following the defeat of Bulgaria, and it passed into Greek hands under the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] in August 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Panayi|1999|loc=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a protocol of the same year, the Turks of Western Thrace were exempted from the 1922-1923 [[exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey|exchange of populations agreement between Greece and Turkey]] and were granted rights within the framework of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. However, since 1923, between 300,000 and 400,000 Turks have left Western Thrace most of which have immigrated to [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="Hirschon 2003 loc=107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hirschon|2003|loc=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be emphasised that the actual Ottoman-era Greek Muslims of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] had been included among those 'Turks' expatriated to Turkey in 1924. including the [[Vallahades]]. In contrast, the Western Thrace Turks are completely distinct from those referred to as Greek Muslims and were exempt from the terms of the population exchange.

A number of estimates and censuses during the 1912-1920 period gave the following results about the ethnic distribution of the area that would become known as Western Thrace:&lt;ref name=Aarbakke&gt;{{cite book | title=The muslim minority of Greek Thrace | author=Vemund Aarbakke | year=2000 | publisher=Phd thesis / University of Bergen | url=http://www.batitrakya.org/yayinlar/arastirmalar/indir/the-muslim-minority-of-greek-thrace.html}}

The Pomak population depending on the source was sometimes counted together with the Turks according to the Ottoman system of classifying people depending on religion, while in other occasions was specified separately. On the other hand, according to the Bulgarian view, they are considered "Bulgarian Muslims" and an integral part of the Bulgarian nation.&lt;ref name=Aarbakke/&gt;

During Ottoman rule before 1912, Greeks constituted a minority in the region of [[Western Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huseyinoglu|first=Ali|title=The Development of Minority Education at the South-easternmost Corner of the EU: The Case of Muslim Turks in Western Thrace, Greece|url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/39339/1/Huseyinoglu,_Ali_%28secured%29.pdf|publisher=University of Sussex|accessdate=2 May 2013|pages=121–122|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]] the demography of the region was changed.

The Lausanne Treaty defined the rights of the Muslim communities in Western Thrace, on the basis of religion, not ethnicity, as well as maintained a balance between the minority communities of both countries (Turks in Greece and [[Greeks in Turkey]]) on reciprocal obligations toward each of those minorities. The Treaty contained specific obligations for their cultural and religious rights. These have been largely respected, in contrast to measures taken by successive Turkish governments against the Greek minority in Turkey (like forced labor battalions, the [[Istanbul pogrom]] and [[Varlik Vergisi]]), a minority that is nearly eliminated today (from 70,000 in 1923 to 3,000 in 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe: p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

===Members of the Greek Parliament===
In 1990 a new electoral law was enacted in Greece, which set a threshold of at least 3% of the nationwide vote for a party to be represented in the parliament. Consequently, independent Turkish MPs were barred from election at the 1993 elections. Since then the Turkish minority in the [[Hellenic Parliament]] has been represented by Turkish deputies belonging to nationwide political parties, and the [[Party of Friendship, Equality and Peace]], which succeeded the Independent Muslim List in 1991, practically disappeared from the electoral scene.&lt;ref name="hersant2009"/&gt;

== Human rights issues ==
{{See also|Human rights in Greece}}

=== Citizenship ===
According to the former Article 19 of the 1955 Citizenship Law (No. 3370), a person of non-Greek ethnic origin leaving Greece without the intention of returning may be declared as having lost Greek nationality. According to the Greek government, between 1955 and 1998, approximately 60,000 Greek Muslim individuals, predominantly Turkish, were deprived of their citizenship under Article 19. Of these 60,000, approximately 7,182 lost their citizenship between 1981 and 1997.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/greece/Greec991-06.htm Greece - The Turks of Western Thrace], January 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The application of this law to the Turks of Western Thrace was a retaliatory measure in response to the devastating state-sponsored pogrom which [[Istanbul pogrom|targeted the Greeks of Istanbul]] in September 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Anagnostou | first = Dia | authorlink = | title = Deepening Democracy or Defending the Nation? The Europeanisation of minority Rights and Greek Citizenship | journal = West European Politics | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 338 | publisher = | location = | year = 2005 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pogrom precipitated an exodus of ethnic Greeks from Turkey. Article 19 was repealed in 1998, though not retroactively.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt;

===Ethnic identity===
Since the Treaty of Lausanne used the criterion of religion to refer to the ethnic communities, the Greek Government has usually insisted that the basis of identification of a minority is religious and not ethnic (or national).&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe: p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Greek officials refer to the Muslim minority in Greece as [[Greek Muslims]], who were based mainly in Western Thrace. Muslim communities also lived in [[Greek Macedonia]], [[Epirus]], and [[Crete]] (see [[Cretan Turks]]) and were the descendants of Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam who joined the Turkish [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)]]. However, these particular communities were relocated from Greece to Turkey following the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|Population exchange signed between the two countries]] in 1922-23, with only the Greek Muslims of Western Thrace exempted from it.

Successive Greek Government policies refused to acknowledge the existence of an ethnic Turkish community in [[Northern Greece]], and insisted on referring to Western Thrace Turks as [[Greek Muslims]], suggesting that they were not of ethnic Turkish origin but were the descendants of Ottoman-era Greek converts to Islam like the [[Vallahades]] and other [[Greek Muslims]] of [[Greek Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Madianou|2005|loc=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was introduced immediately after the unilateral [[Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|declaration of independence]] of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] in 1983 on lands that once had an 82% Greek majority before becoming [[refugees]] during the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] in 1974. The Greek government declared that it was a measure to avert the possibility of the Greek region of [[Eastern Macedonia and Thrace]] becoming a "second Cyprus" sometime in the future or of being [[Cession|ceded]] to [[Turkey]] on the basis of the ethnic origin of its Muslim inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antoniou|first=Dimitris|title=Western Thracian Muslims in Athens|journal=Balkanologie|year=2005|volume=IX|issue=1-2|url=http://balkanologie.revues.org/index579.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek courts have also outlawed the use of the word 'Turkish' to describe the Turkish community. In 1988, the Greek Supreme Court affirmed a 1986 decision of the Court of Appeals of Thrace in which the ''Union of Turkish Associations of Western Thrace'' was ordered closed. The court held that the use of the word 'Turkish' referred to [[Turkish nationality law|citizens of Turkey]], and could not be used to describe [[Greek nationality law|citizens of Greece]]; the use of the word 'Turkish' to describe Greek Muslims was held to endanger public order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to about 10,000 people demonstrating against the decision in Western Thrace. According to members of the Turkish minority, it was the first time ethnic Turks had taken to the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of expression ===
More than 10 newspapers are issued in the [[Turkish language]]. According to some sources, newspapers, magazines and books published in Turkey are not allowed entry into Western Thrace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Karpat|2002|loc=537}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Turkish television and radio stations are sometimes jammed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, the minority has full and independent access to its own newspapers radio, television, and other written media coming from Turkey, regardless of their content.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe: p. 10, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious freedom ===
According to the Lausanne Treaty, the Turkish minority is entitled to [[freedom of religion]] and to the right to control charitable and religious institutions. However, the Turkish community believes that these international law guarantees have been violated by the Greek government&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by denying permission to repair or rebuild old [[mosques]] or to build new mosques, by denying the right to choose the [[muftis]] (this chief religious officers), and by efforts to control the Turkish communities charitable foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Whitman|1990|loc=27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to another source, 
more than 5 new mosques are being built in the prefecture of Xanthi alone and 19 new mosques are being built in the prefecture of Rhodope alone, while in the same prefecture the number of mosques exceeds 160.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe: p. 10, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidents===
According to a report by a local organization there have been frequent (six in 2010 and three in the first months of 2011) attacks against the private and public property of Turks in Western Thrace. Among the recent incidents are three in 2010 (in Kahveci, Kırmahalle, Popos and Ifestos at Komotini) where attackers desecrated Turkish cemeteries and broke tombstones. There were also attacks against mosques, Turkish associations and Turkish consulates, attackers used methods like throwing stones, molotov bombs and damaging buildings.&lt;ref name="ABTTF"&gt;''Parallel Report by Federation of Western Thrace Turks in Europe on the 2010 Human Rights Report: Greece'' 8 April 2011 [https://www.abttf.org/images/Raporlar/US-2010-Human-Rights-Report-on-Greece_Parallel-Report-by-ABTTF.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyet"&gt;''Vandals desecrate Turkish graves in Greece, police say'' Hürriyet Daily News, 15 August 2010 [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=vandals-desecrate-turkish-graves-in-greece-police-2010-08-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Muslim Cemetery in Komotini Vandalized'' Greek Reporter, 15 August 2010 [http://greece.greekreporter.com/2010/08/15/vandals-desecrate-turkish-graves-in-greece/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Desecrations of cemeteries are hate crimes that exacerbate intolerance'' Council of Europe, 30 December 2010 [https://wcd.coe.int/wcd/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1713937]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''July–December, 2010 International Religious Freedom Report, Greece'', US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010_5/168314.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration==

=== Diaspora ===

Between 300,000 and 400,000 Turks have left Western Thrace since 1923; most of them immigrated to Turkey.&lt;ref name="Hirschon 2003 loc=107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitman 1990 loc=2"/&gt; Western Thrace Turks have also immigrated to [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]] and [[Italy]]. Thus, overall there are an estimated 1 million Turks whose roots are from Western Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kultur|title=BATI TRAKYA TÜRK EDEBİYATI|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:aGZWuiEwTzEJ:ekitap.kultur.gov.tr/Genel/dg.ashx%3FBELGEANAH%3D130755%26DIL%3D1%26DOSYAISIM%3Dbatitrakyaturkedebiyati.pdf+bati+trakya+turler+ABD&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh-eJgkK3l82DgV0AwIDAk2IjYOaEU4fFUNPVLD7Ygbkj66cwCwLPnk8DoWZxC0fgCFCkYq8UcmdVJ2O09SLSecHhdmEDKtrbXU9Nnie-p-a4B11hHdTqDz08Nrr95sYAGoJRH4&amp;sig=AHIEtbQG2nDOViFskm2eJAjvIrSJ1Do3WA|accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
It is estimated that there are between 25,000 and 40,000 Western Thrace Turks living in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Şentürk|2008|loc=420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Witten Batı Trakya Türkleri Yardımlaşma ve Dayanışma Derneği|title=Batı Trakya`da "Aynı Gökyüzü Altında" bir Güldeste |url=http://www.wittenbttd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=81&amp;Itemid=35|accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
{{See also|Turks in Germany}}
There are some members of the [[Greek Muslims|Greek Muslim]] community among the some 350,000 [[Greeks in Germany|Greeks living in Germany]] who are Turks or who espouse a Turkish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Westerlund|Svanberg|1999|loc=320-321}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Turks immigrated from [[Western Thrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Council of Europe: Parliamentary Assembly|2007|loc=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, the Thracian tobacco industry was affected by a severe crisis and many tobacco growers lost their income. This resulted in many Turks leaving their homes and immigrating to [[Germany]] with estimates suggesting that today there are now between 12,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clogg|2002|loc=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 25,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International Assembly of Western Thrace Turks|title=POLITICAL AND CIVIL ORGANISATION COMMISSION|url=http://www.batitrakya.info/btt/Content.aspx?mID=4;12&amp;l=en-US|accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; residing in Germany.

====Netherlands====
{{See also|Turks in the Netherlands}}
A minority of Western Thrace Turks can be found in the Netherlands, especially in the [[Randstad]] region; after Germany, the Netherlands is the most popular destination for Turkish immigrants.&lt;ref name="Şentürk 2008 loc=427"&gt;{{Harvnb|Şentürk|2008|loc=427}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
{{See also|Turks in the United Kingdom|Turks in London}}
There are an estimated 600-700 Western Thrace Turks living in [[London]] although this does not include those who are British-born. The total number living outside London is unknown.&lt;ref name="Şentürk 2008 loc=427"/&gt; However even their small number, Western Thrace Turks in the UK have their own community ('''Association of Western Thrace Turks UK''')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.batitrakya.org.uk/ Official website of Association of Western Thrace Turks in UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universal Alliance''' (French: Alliance universelle), formerly known as '''Universal Christian Church''' (''Église chrétienne universelle'') and followers as '''Christ's Witnesses''' (''Témoins du Christ''),&lt;ref name="Tallec"&gt;{{cite book |title=Petit dictionnaire des cultes politiques en France: 1960-2000 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay50PMddCi8C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=%22alliance+universelle%22+georges+roux#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alliance%20universelle%22%20georges%20roux&amp;f=false |first=Cyril |last=Le Tallec |publisher=L'Harmattan |place=Paris |year=2010 |language=French |page=245 |isbn=2-296-12941-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Christianity|Christian]]-oriented [[new religious movement]] founded in France in 1952 by Georges Roux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henri |last=Desroche |title=Dieux d'hommes: dictionnaire des messianismes et millénarismes de l'ère chrétienne |year=1969 |place=Haia |publisher=Mouton editions |language=French |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former postman in the [[Vaucluse]] department. Roux claimed to be the [[reincarnation]] of Christ and was thus named the "Christ of [[Montfavet]]", a village on the commune of Avignon where he lived then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alain de Benoist |title=Vu de droite: anthologie critique des idées contemporaines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jd-YQqAhS7sC&amp;pg=PA416 |publisher= |language=French |page=416 |year=2001 |accessdate=30 August 2009|isbn=9782869800519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote three books containing the doctrines of the religious group, including the rejection of several dogmas commonly accepted by the main churches (Jesus' divinity and resurrection, Devil's existence and accuracy of the Gospels, among other things). [[Vegetarianism|Vegetarian diet]], high degree of [[proselytism]] and miraculous healings were the main practices of the organization. The group grew quickly in France and some other countries, counting several thousands of faithful, but memberships are currently on the decline.

After Roux's death in 1981, the Universal Christian Church was replaced by the Universal Alliance, a cultural association founded in August 1983 and led by one of Roux's daughter. In the 1950s, the religious group was the subject of criticisms in the media when some faithful and their children died after having refused medical treatments, and was classified as a [[cult]] in the [[List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents#France|1995 parliamentary report]] established by the [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]].

==Founder==
Born on 14 June 1903 in [[Cavaillon]] from an unbeliever father and a [[Catholic]] mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alain |last=Woodrow |title=Les Nouvelles Sectes |year=1977 |publisher=Le Seuil editions, Points-Actuels collection |page=53 |isbn=2-02-005971-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Ernest Roux quickly abandoned the faith after reading [[Plato]]'s works,&lt;ref name="Dico"&gt;{{cite book |title=Les marges du christianisme, "sectes", dissidences, ésotérisme — Dictionnaire du monde religieux dans la France contemporaine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=chQ-z_5EYIkC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=%22alliance+universelle%22+georges+roux#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alliance%20universelle%22%20georges%20roux&amp;f=false |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Chantin |publisher=Beauchesne |place=Paris |year=2001 |language=French |pages=212, 213 |isbn=2-7010-1418-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became factor in 1920. In the late 1920s, he went to Paris to try an artistic career, and composed, among other things, a poem (''Le Cercle d'airain''), a novel (''Le toit de paille''), and a one-act play (''Le Bienheureux''). On 12 April 1928, he married Jane Robert, and they had together six children raised in Catholicism. Then he founded a [[symphony orchestra]] and composed an opera (''L'Auréole'') in 1939, but the beginning of the [[World War II]] forced him to resume service as inspector at the post office in Avignon, where it stayed until December 1953.&lt;ref name="Dericquebourg"&gt;{{cite web |first=Régis |last=Dericquebourg |title=Les adeptes du Christ de Montfavet.

He published three spirituality-related books which explained his doctrine. In 1947, then in 1950, he revealed to his family that he was the incarnation of Jesus Christ, then made it publicly known in February 1954.&lt;ref name="Info-sectes"&gt;{{cite web |author=Info-sectes |title=Alliance universelle — Église chrétienne universelle (les disciples du Christ de Montfavet) |url=http://www.info-sectes.org/sectesgd/monfavet.htm |language=French |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 1973, Roux even claimed to be God. He died on 26 December 1981.&lt;ref name="Dico"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Vernette |authorlink1=Jean Vernette |first2=Claire |last2=Moncelon |title=Dictionnaire des groupes religieux aujourd'hui (religions - églises - sectes - nouveaux mouvements religieux - mouvements spiritualistes) |publisher=Presses Universitaires de France |place= |language=French |year=2001 |isbn=978-2-13-052026-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
In the early 1950s, some followers of Roux created the Christian Agency of Information (Agence Chrétienne d'Information, ACI) in the [[10th arrondissement of Paris]], 18 rue d'Enghien. From 1953, they published two monthly leaflets: ''Lumière'' and ''Le Témoin de la vie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Guy |last=Breton |title=Les nuits secrètes de Paris |year=1963 |pages=223–35 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 December 1952, Roux, then known as the Christ of Montfavet or Georges-Christ, founded the Universal Christian Church whose faithful were widely named the Christ's Witnesses. There was no [[hierarchical]] structure: the local groups were informal and autonomous, but the most important ones (in Avignon, Paris, Strasbourg, Toulon) formed associations for organizational purposes.&lt;ref name="Dericquebourg"/&gt; Roux's daughters Genevieve and Jacqueline, Jacqueline's husband René Van Gerding, and René's sister Eva participated in the development of the church, while Roux lived cloistered in his property in Montfavet.&lt;ref name="Airieau"&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Airieau |title=Aspects psychosociologiques et historiques |url=http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Intervention_de_Airiau_seminaire_Sectes_et_laicite.pdf |work=Séminaire MIVILUDES/Recherche 2003-2004 |publisher=[[MIVILUDES]] |format=PDF |language=French |pages=15, 16 |date= |accessdate=30 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128075900/http://www.miviludes.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Intervention_de_Airiau_seminaire_Sectes_et_laicite.pdf |archive-date=28 November 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 1983, the Universal Alliance officially replaced the Universal Christian Church. Its statutes, filed at the Prefecture of [[Avignon]], were modified in 2004. With about 500 subscribers, this cultural association&lt;ref name="Quid"&gt;{{cite book |title=Quid |chapter=Autres communautés et associations d'inspiration biblique ou chrétienne |publisher=Robert Laffont |place=France |year=2002 |page=553 |isbn=2-221-09758-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to air and translate Roux's writings and to organize conferences by Jacqueline Roux.&lt;ref name="Dericquebourg"/&gt;

Sociologist [[Régis Dericquebourg]] defined the Christian Agency of Information as a "movement", the Universal Christian Church as an "ecclesia" and the Universal Alliance as a "circle". He considered the Universal Alliance  a "network of thought and spirituality circles", which perpetuates Roux's teachings and has a [[Quaker]] and [[charismatic]]-related spirituality.&lt;ref name="Dericquebourg"/&gt;

==Beliefs==
The doctrines are contained in three books written by Roux: ''Journal d'un guérisseur'' (1950), ''Paroles du guérisseur'' (1950) and ''Mission divine'' (1951),&lt;ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt; * {{cite web |author=Alliance Universelle |title=Journal d'un guérisseur |url=http://alliance-universelle.org/asp/l1.asp?doc_id=243&amp;doc_cat_1=Documents |publisher=Alliance Universelle |language=French |accessdate=30 August 2009}} &lt;br/&gt; * {{cite web |author=Alliance Universelle |title=Paroles du Guérisseur |url=http://alliance-universelle.org/asp/l1.asp?doc_id=244&amp;doc_cat_1=Documents |publisher=Alliance Universelle |language=French |accessdate=30 August 2009}} &lt;br/&gt; * {{cite web |author=Alliance Universelle |title=Mission divine |url=http://alliance-universelle.org/asp/l1.asp?doc_id=245&amp;doc_cat_1=Documents |publisher=Alliance Universelle |language=French |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explained in the monthly magazine ''Messidor'', published from 1951 to 1977. Roux presented himself as a persecuted prophet, said to be Christ and to carry out the law of love unfulfilled by God's representatives including Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Bayard |title=Guide des sociétés secrètes et des sectes |publisher=Nouvelle Imprimerie Labollery |place=Paris |year=2004 |page=247 |language=French |isbn=2-84898-039-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a strong criticism of Christian churches deemed as [[apostate]], asked in a letter [[Pope Pius XII]] to officially recognize his reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Les Sectes, État d'urgence — Mieux les connaître, mieux s'en défendre en France et dans le monde |author=Centre Roger Ikor |chapter=Antoinisme |publisher=Albin Michel |year=1995 |place=Paris |language=French |isbn=2-226-07711-1 |pages=41, 42 |authorlink=Centre contre les manipulations mentales}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sent [[open letter]]s to priests, [[occultist]]s and [[theosophist]]s.&lt;ref name="Sectes"/&gt; Roux denied the existence of the [[Devil]], [[original sin]], Jesus' [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]] and resurrection, and the truthfulness of the Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Ohlott |title=Les prétendants au Trône céleste ! |url=http://www.topchretien.com/topinfo/view/16413/dossier-inedit-les-pretendants-au-trone-celeste.html |work= |publisher=Top Chrétien |language=French |date=20 August 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that everyone could be a healer with prayer and blessing if he had faith in him. Roux announced the [[Last Judgment]] for 1 January 1980 at the latest and said that the Universal Alliance would have to spread across the world.&lt;ref name="Dico"/&gt; In 1953, some disasters, including outs levees in the Netherlands and earthquakes in the Greek islands, were used by the religion as proof of the proximity of the Apocalypse.&lt;ref name="Sectes"/&gt; According to ''[[Le Monde]]'', followers said in 1954 to believe in [[flying saucers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Soucoupes volantes et disciples du Christ de Montfavet |journal=[[Le Monde]] |publisher=La Vie-Le Monde |place=Paris |language=French |date=1 October 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Régis Dericquebourg, this movement presents a new version of Christianity: there is no [[syncretism]], but it is strongly tinged with [[Gnosticism]] and can be described as a "Christic [[esotericism]]". The founder was successively a [[mystagogue]], then a prophet, and the group was first based on a personal and prophetic charisma, then a sacramental charism, then a group charism. The group defines itself as "christian", then "christic",&lt;ref name="Dericquebourg"/&gt; also developed [[environmentalism]] and the "idea of a symbiosis between man and nature as the foundation of health and spiritual improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Régis |last=Dericquebourg |authorlink=Régis Dericquebourg |title=L'enseignement de Georges Roux, un ésotérisme christique ? |url=http://www.regis-dericquebourg.com/2009/03/24/lenseignement-de-georges-roux-un-esoterisme-christique/ |publisher= |language=French |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
In the Universal Christian Church, religious ceremonies began with a modified version of "[[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]]" and ended with a meal together. The [[crucifix]] was not used.&lt;ref name="Info-sectes"/&gt; There were five sacraments: baptism, marriage, confirmation-communion, communion of mind in meetings, and funeral.  The religious group proposed, but did not required, a vegetarian diet excluding cannings, potatoes, sugar, salt, alcohol, tobacco and tea.&lt;ref name="Dericquebourg"/&gt; The faithful actively participated in [[proselytism]] by distribution of leaflets and [[door-to-door]], and there was sometimes stands in some fairs of major cities and parades of [[sandwich board]]s in Paris.&lt;ref name="Sectes"/&gt; Several members, including veteran Jean Thos in Paris, were candidates for legislative elections of 2 January 1956; in its political program, the religious movement said wanting to follow God's will and pointed social issues as homeless, armament, [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] by employers. It obtained about 10,000 votes in six departments.&lt;ref name="Tallec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Info-sectes"/&gt;

In the Universal Alliance, there is no sacrament. The meetings, now called "communion of the flesh", are composed of spontaneous dialogues under divine inspiration.&lt;ref name="Dericquebourg"/&gt; Evangelism is no longer required and children attend the public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Hubert |last=Prolongeau |title=Sectes: menace sur les enfants |url=http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p1861/dossier/a46332-sectes_menace_sur_les_enfants.html |agency= [[Le Nouvel Observateur]] |publisher=Perdriel Group |location=Paris |language=French |date=6 July 2000 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the Universal Christian Church reached a peak of 5,000 between 1955 and 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Membership and geography data for 4,300+ religions, churches, tribes, etc |url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_418.html |publisher=Adherents.com |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in about fifty local groups (Marseille, Nantes, Paris, Strasbourg, Toulon, etc.).&lt;ref name="Sectes"/&gt; Members seem primarily urban, from middle class (teachers, employees...),&lt;ref name="Airieau"/&gt; and Catholic disillusioned by traditional religions.&lt;ref name="Sectes"/&gt; However, membership gradually decreased in subsequent years mainly because of Roux's death and various incidents in the late 1950s which reflected some difficult relationships with the society (child deaths, negative statements in the press, destruction of premises belonging to the group...).&lt;ref name="Sectes"/&gt; in the 2000, they are about 3,000 members of the Universal Alliance worldwide spread in [[francophone]] countries, Germany, Italy, U.S. and some countries in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Anicet Kashamura, ''Culture et aliénation en Afrique: essai sur la vie quotidienne dans une société aliénée'', 1972, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; and shared out into fifty communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Van Girt |title=La France aux cent sectes |publisher=Vauvenargues |place=Manchecourt |year=1997 |pages=21–23 |language=French |isbn=2-7443-0049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 1,000 in France. Groups are mainly located in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] region and the [[Aude]] department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sébastien |last=Marti |title=Sectes: près de 500 adeptes recensés |url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2002/03/09/399302-Sectes-pres-de-500-adeptes-recenses.html |journal=[[La Dépêche du Midi]] |publisher=La Dépêche Group |place=Toulouse |language=French |date=13 March 2002 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Belgian press reported presence of followers and conferences by Jacqueline Roux in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Des adeptes de l'Alliance Uuniverselle dans notre pays — Sectes: Le Christ de Montfavet visite la Belgique |url=http://archives.lesoir.be/des-adeptes-de-l-alliance-universelle-dans-notre-pays-s_t-19971015-Z0EC85.html |journal=Le Soir |first=Alain |last=Lallemand |date=15 October 1997 |place=Brussels |publisher=Rossel |page=16 |language=French |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the 1950s, refusals of medical treatments led to the death of several children, including a 13-year boy in October 1953, a young girl in March 1954, and a three-month baby in September 1954. These cases were the subject of a strong coverage in the press, particularly in ''[[Paris-Match]]''.&lt;ref name="Airieau"/&gt; For their part, the church's leaders often tried, in [[news conference]]s, to justify these deaths, presenting them as "rewards offered to Christ".&lt;ref name="Sectes"/&gt; Deaths of adults were also mentioned in media (e.g. Willy Baruch in March 1954, Raymond Joutard in July 1954). However, Roux was never sued for unauthorized practice of medicine.

In 1995, the Universal Alliance was included in the list of cults of the report by the French parliamentary commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enquête sur les sectes — ''Les sectes en France'' |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher=Assemblée Nationale |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Jacqueline Roux wrote to [[Alain Gest]], a member of the commission, to question this classification, highlighting financial transparency, democratic nature and compliance with the law of her association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacqueline |last=Roux |title=Lettre à Alain Gest |url=http://alliance-universelle.org/asp/l1.asp?doc_cat_1=Lettre |publisher=Alliance Universelle |language=French |date=29 January 1996 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its particular doctrinal views, the religious group is criticized by main Christian churches, including evangelical associations.&lt;ref name="Info-sectes"/&gt;
