      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11960">The '''1938 Belgrade Car Show''' was the first [[car show]] organized in [[Belgrade]], the capital of [[Serbia]]. Held from 5 to 15 March 1938, it was one of the 9 officially registered car shows in Europe at the time. The show evolved into an annual event, today internationally labeled "BG Car Show" ({{lang-sr|Београдски сајам аутомобила}}, {{lang|sr-Latn|Beogradski sajam automobila}}).

== Introduction ==

At the time, Belgrade was the capital of [[Yugoslavia]], which was generally considered the "non-motorized" state. The first car appeared in Belgrade in 1903 and, statistically, in the second half of the 1930s Yugoslavia had only 1 car on 1,000 inhabitants, while Germany had 15, United Kingdom 40 and France 53. The state decided to assemble the plan to motorize the country and popularize the automobiles, to the point that "motorization" became one of the most discussed economic, but also political, topics.&lt;ref name=magazin&gt;{{ cite news | author = D.Stevanović | title = Мотори који су мењали историју | trans-title = Engines which changed history | newspaper = [[Politika]]-Magazin, No. 1068 | pages = 28-29 | language = Serbian | date = 18 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=novosti&gt;{{ cite news | author = Zoran Nikolić | title = Beogradske priče: Sajam automobila 1938. | trans-title = Belgrade stories: 1938 car show | newspaper = [[Večernje Novosti]] | language = Serbian | date = 26 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that period, Vlada Ilić - one of the wealthiest industrialist in the state and mayor of Belgrade 1936-39 - negotiated with the [[Ford Motor Company]] in order to obtain the licence to assemble cars in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://novinardkocic.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B0-%D0%B7-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B-%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%9B-%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%87/ |author = Danilo Kocić, Saša Z.

The royals were also included in the process of the automobiles popularization. [[Maria of Yugoslavia|Queen mother Maria]] was an enthusiastic driver. A Romanian princess, she was driving before she married [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] of Yugoslavia and, as the future bride, she personally drove her mother from [[Bucharest]] to Belgrade, driving her luxurious [[Delage]]. She also drove from Belgrade to [[Paris]], almost {{convert|1,800|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt; As a queen, she was often seen driving her [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] through Belgrade, which was a major rarity at the time, both because she was a royal and a woman. She quit driving on her own, though, after her husband was assassinated in the car in 1934, in [[Marseilles]], France. The Queen was a patron of the Automobile Club of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia which organized the [[Belgrade Grand Prix]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Dragan Perić | title = Beogradski vremeplov - Pedeset krugova oko Kalemegdana za "gran-pri" | trans-title = Belgrade chronicle - Fifty laps around the [[Kalemegdan]], for "grand-prix" | newspaper = [[Politika]]-Magazin, No. 1041 | pages = 28-29 | language = Serbian | date = 10 September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The still minor [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter II]] was named a patron of the car show in 1938.&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt;

The idea of organizing the show in Belgrade was suggested by [[Daimler-Benz]]. Despite strong protest against the motion which came from some other European fairs, the Belgrade car show was held and accepted as one of the 9 officially registered car shows in Europe.&lt;ref name=magazin/&gt; In February 1938, the Belgrade press was announcing the event. A common place in the articles was that the show will push for the popularity and development of the cars. Velizar Janković, former transportation minister, wrote about the importance of such shows, saying that President of France and Führer of Germany open the shows in Paris and Berlin, respectively, which shows how significant these events are. Yugoslav prime minister [[Milan Stojadinović]] said that "Yugoslavia, at this moment, has only 12,000 automobiles, mostly defective", estimating that the state needs at least 150,000 vehicles. The press was vocal about the high taxes which owners of the vehicles had to pay, especially for the trucks, claiming that Bucharest, the capital of [[Romania]], had more cars than the entire Kingdom of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt;

== Venue ==
[[File:Staro sajmište 2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Belgrade Fair, location of the 1938 car show]]

The car show was held at the newly constructed Belgrade Fair venue on the left side of the [[Sava]] river, across the Belgrade at that time. The foundation stone was ceremonially placed on 6 June 1937. Works were finished in three months and the facility was open on 11 September 1937. It had modern and artistic buildings, including the high metal spike construction, which became known as the Central Tower. It was designed by the architects Milivoje Tričković, Rajko Tatić and Đorđe Lukić who envisioned it as the monumental modern complex, with the Central Tower as the domineering motif. Around the tower, the exhibition pavilions were built, including five Yugoslav, one for the “Nikola Spasić Foundation”, the national pavilions of Italy, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary and the Dutch company [[Philips]]. The complex included: {{convert|17,000|m2|abbr=on}} of roofed exhibition space, {{convert|20,000|m2|abbr=on}} of open exhibition space, {{convert|25,000|m2|abbr=on}} of lawns and flower beds and {{convert|22,000|m2|abbr=on}} of roads and paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Daliborka Mučibabić | title = Centralna kula – stožer memorijalnog kompleksa | trans-title = Central tower - the pivot of the memorial complex | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 19 | language = Serbian | date = 5 Jul 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Ana Jovanović | title = Mesto za trgovinu robom i izlaganje poslovnih ponuda | trans-title = A place for the trade of goods and laying of the business proposals | newspaper = Politika | page = 15 | language = Serbian | date = 11 September 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388616/Mesto-za-trgovinu-robom-i-izlaganje-poslovnih-ponuda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the occupational German and Croatian forces turned the complex into the [[Sajmište concentration camp]]. It was never rebuilt and the new Belgrade Fair venue was open in 1957, across the river, so the old locality is today known as the [[Staro Sajmište]] ("old fairground").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/378471/Na-praznik-padale-bombe | author = J.

== Show ==

The show was held 5-15 March 1938 and was open by the minister of trade, Milan Vrbanić. King Peter and his mother Queen Maria later toured the show, visiting all the exhibited vehicles.&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt;

There were 107 exhibitors, from [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]] and Yugoslavia. Due to the space constrictions, application from further 117 exhibitors were denied. Exhibitors and dealers included:&lt;ref name=magazin/&gt;&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt;

Altogether, 375 vehicles were displayed. There were 158 [[Car|passenger cars]], 65 trucks, 10 buses, 18 chassis, 105 motorbikes and bicycles, 10 car engines, 3 tractors and 1 excavator. The most popular displays were those of Opel, BMW, Fiat, Dodge, Chevrolet, Buick and Mercedes. Commercial vehicles were presented by Mercedes, Büssing, WUMAG and Krupp. In total, the show had 40,000 visitors and most of the cars that were purchased during the exhibition were the [[limousines]],&lt;ref name=magazin/&gt; as the car was still considered a luxury in Yugoslavia at the time.&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt;

Opel exhibited a specially designed car which had a shell made of transparent [[Plexiglas]] so that visitors could see the machinery inside the car. It was a major novelty at the time.&lt;ref name=novosti/&gt;

The number of exhibitors grew in the second and third shows, which were held in 1939 and 1940. Despite the outbreak of [[World War II]], the exhibitors came from Germany, Italy, United States, [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. Especially popular were the cars with the [[wood gas]] engines. Fourth show, planned for the May 1941 was canceled after the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|German invasion of Yugoslavia]], which included the heavy [[Operation Retribution (1941)|bombing of Belgrade]], began on 6 April 1941.&lt;ref name=magazin/&gt;

After the new [[Belgrade Fair]] was finished in 1957, the car show was revived. Originally, it was held in 1957, 1959 and 1961 as part of the International Fair of Technics, and became a location for establishing the business connections between dealers. In 1965 the car show had 525.000 visitors while in 1966 the first fair [[Rallying|rally]] under the European criteria was organized and the show officially entered the International calendar of car shows. In 1970 the show had 586 exhibitors from 23 countries from 4 continents on the exhibition area of  {{convert|52,000|m2|abbr=on}}. It was the first time that the racing cars were also displayed. In 1971, despite cancelling of the [[International Motor Show Germany|show in Frankfurt]] and troubles with the [[Paris Motor Show]], 403 exhibitors came to the Belgrade show.&lt;ref name=magazin/&gt;

In the 1980s the fair was held to high regard and was compared to the shows in [[Geneva Motor Show|Geneva]], [[Automobile Barcelona|Barcelona]] or [[Turin Auto Show|Turin]]. In 1991, despite the heavy economical and political crisis in Yugoslavia and the quotas for the import of the equipment and technologies imposed by the state which reduced the number of exhibitors, the show was still the largest one in the [[Eastern Europe]]. Despite the period of wars and economic sanctions in the 1990s, the fair survived.&lt;ref name=magazin/&gt; Since 2013 it is officially named "DDOR BG CAR SHOW".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sajamautomobila.rs/ Official site of the Belgrade Car Show]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sajam.rs/sr/%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%80-2018/ddor-bg-car-show-06/ Belgrade Car Show page on the site of the Belgrade Fair]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]]'s presumed [[electoral college]] victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election of 2016]], a group of [[computer scientist]]s, [[cyber security]] experts, and [[election monitor]]s raised concerns about the integrity of the election results.

In accordance with the [[Electoral Commission (United States)#Aftermath|Electoral Count Act of 1887]], all states must certify and submit their final election results to the electoral college six days before the college meets.

==Background==
After the election, a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers including [[J. Alex Halderman]], (director of the [[University of Michigan]] Center for Computer Security and Society) and [[John Bonifaz]], (founder of the [[National Voting Rights Institute]]) began studying the election results and found statistical anomalies. For example, Clinton's votes were 7% lower than expected in counties that used electronic [[voting machine]]s to tally votes, as opposed to using [[paper ballot]]s and [[optical scan voting system]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherman|first1=Gabriel|title=Experts Urge Clinton Campaign to Challenge Election Results in 3 Swing States|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/activists-urge-hillary-clinton-to-challenge-election-results.html|website=nymag.com|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Age&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/us-election/us-election-hillary-clinton-agrees-to-take-part-in-vote-recount-20161127-gsye2a.html|title=US election: Hillary Clinton agrees to take part in vote recount|first=Nick|last=Allen|date=November 27, 2016|work=theage.com.au|accessdate=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Wisconsin]], there was a significant increase in the number of [[absentee ballot]]s and Trump did far better than expected in counties that used only electronic voting; and there was a sizable increase in the number of ballots cast in [[Michigan]] that left the presidential field blank.&lt;ref name="Guardian background"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swaine|first1=Jon|last2=Chalabi|first2=Mona|title=US election recount: how it began – and what effect it could have|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/28/election-recount-jill-stein-hillary-clinton-donald-trump|accessdate=4 December 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 presidential election was also unprecedented in that, as ''The Guardian'' reports:

: "The election had taken place against a backdrop of warnings from the US government that Russian hackers were “scanning and probing” the election systems of American states, and were behind the theft of emails from the [[Democratic National Committee]] and [[John Podesta]], the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Eight days before the election, the White House had used an emergency hotline to warn Russia against further interference."&lt;ref name="Guardian background" /&gt;

The loose coalition of computer scientists and lawyers advocated for an [[election recount]] in three [[Swing state|battleground state]]s ([[United States presidential election in Wisconsin, 2016|Wisconsin]], [[United States presidential election in Pennsylvania, 2016|Pennsylvania]], and [[United States presidential election in Michigan, 2016|Michigan]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump election: Wisconsin prepares for vote recount|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38112752|website=BBC News|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] Trump had narrow victories of less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox6now.com/2016/11/22/computer-scientists-urge-hillary-clintons-campaign-to-call-for-recount-in-wi-mi-pa/|title=Computer scientists urge Hillary Clinton’s campaign to call for recount in WI, MI, PA|date=November 23, 2016|work=fox6now.com|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes (0.2%), Pennsylvania by 49,543 (0.8%), and Wisconsin by 27,257 votes (0.7%). A shift of half of these from Trump to Clinton would mean Clinton would get enough electoral votes to win, and a shift in these states would constitute the smallest shift which would have this effect. In order to petition these states, a presidential candidate would need to file the recount request. Stein agreed to lead the effort after the group was unable to persuade the Clinton team to file.&lt;ref name="Guardian background" /&gt;

While most experts agree that [[voter fraud]] and [[Cyber-attack|cyberattacks]] are possible, they disagree about the extent to which these could have impacted the results of the 2016 presidential election.&lt;ref name="Guardian background" /&gt; Statistician [[Nate Silver]] performed a [[regression analysis]] which demonstrated that the alleged discrepancy between paper ballots and electronic voting machines "completely disappears once you control for race and education level".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/801221907609579520|title=Nate Silver on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two Stanford University students named Rodolfo Cortes and Alex Geijsel, and a trio of statisticians who write for the website U.S. Economic Snapshot named Thomas Cooley, Ben Griffy and Peter Rupert also analyzed those claims and found that though demographics accounted for some of the vote total, there was still a significant correlation with voting machine use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@rodolfocortes/trumps-curiously-high-support-in-certain-wisconsin-counties-a-statistical-analysis-4191589f1d36|title=Trump’s curiously high support in certain Wisconsin counties: A statistical analysis|last=Cortes|first=Rodolfo|date=2016-11-28|website=Medium|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://econsnapshot.com/2016/12/06/electronic-voting-machines-and-the-election/|title=Electronic Voting Machines and the Election|last=Griffy|first=Ben|date=2016-12-06|website=U.S. Economic Snapshot|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 23, Halderman wrote,
: "I believe the most likely explanation is that the polls were systematically wrong, rather than that the election was hacked. But I don’t believe that either one of these seemingly unlikely explanations is overwhelmingly more likely than the other."&lt;ref name="Halderman Medium"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Halderman |first1=J.

===Funding campaign and expenses===
[[File:Jill Stein 2016 presidential recount donation page.png|thumb|The donation page of Jill Stein's 2016 presidential election recount efforts on November 24, 2016.]]
A [[funding]] campaign to cover the legal costs of the various recounts began on November 23, with an initial goal of $2.2 million to cover filing fees in Wisconsin. Donors quickly reached and surpassed that goal, which was subsequently raised to $4.5 million to cover filing fees in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="TBG3rd"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jill Stein eyes 3rd fund-raising goal for recount|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2016/11/25/jill-stein-eyes-fundraising-goal-for-recount/XZmSjx33sil5BjBPFDOCCM/story.html|last1=Ortiz|first1=Aimee|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=November 25, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why are people giving Jill Stein millions of dollars for an election recount?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/24/why-are-people-giving-jill-stein-millions-of-dollars-for-an-election-recount/|last1=Weigel|first1=David|publisher=The Washington Post|date=November 24, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jill Stein nears $4.5M goal to fund key-state recounts|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/24/jill-stein-raises-42m-fund-key-state-recounts/94403286/|last1=Kertscher|first1=Tom|publisher=USA Today|date=November 24, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was met on November 25, and the goal was raised a second time to $7 million for Michigan's filing fees.&lt;ref name="TBG3rd"/&gt; The goal was raised a third time to $9.5 million on November 28 after Wisconsin increased its filing fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Increases Recount Filing Fee to Outrageous $3.5-million|url=http://www.jill2016.com/filingfeewi|website=Jill2016.com|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total funds raised by the Stein campaign for the recounts eventually reached $7.33 million, with nearly 161,300 individual donors contributing in all.&lt;ref name="Costs"&gt;{{cite web|title=With Multi-State Presidential Recount Over, Stein Campaign Ends Fundraising Drive|url=http://www.jill2016.com/fundraising_ends|website=Jill2016.com|date=December 13, 2016|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conclusion of the recount efforts, the Stein campaign claimed that costs for the recounts totaled $7.43 million, exceeding the amount that was raised. A published breakdown of expenditures showed that $212,500 was spent on staff payroll; $364,000 on consultants; $353,618 on administrative expenses such as travel costs; $3,499,689 on the filing fees in Wisconsin; $16,000 on the filing fees in Pennsylvania; $973,250 on the filing fees in Michigan; $1,630,200 on associated legal expenses; $150,000 on ongoing litigation as of December 13; and a final $150,000 on compliance costs.&lt;ref name="Costs"/&gt;

On November 25, 90 minutes before the deadline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/1126/Clinton-joins-Jill-Stein-for-recounts-in-Wisconsin-Michigan-and-Pennsylvania|title=Clinton joins Jill Stein for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=November 26, 2016|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein filed a petition to the [[Wisconsin Elections Commission]] for a recount of the state's votes. A request for a recount was also made by Independent presidential candidate [[Rocky De La Fuente]].&lt;ref name="watp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/25/503349326/people-have-donated-millions-to-jill-steins-recount-campaign-is-it-worth-it |title=Wisconsin Agrees To Presidential Vote Recount At Third-Party Candidates' Requests |author=Martha Ann Overland |accessdate=November 29, 2016 |date=November 25, 2016 |work=NPR }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Wisconsin, a recount would involve a manual examination of all three million ballots, with a completion deadline of December 13.

On November 26, the Clinton campaign's general counsel [[Marc Elias]] stated that their campaign would join Stein's recount efforts in Wisconsin and possibly others "in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides." He also noted that, "Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves."&lt;ref name="splits"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elias|first=Marc|author-link=Marc Elias|title=Listening and Responding To Calls for an Audit and Recount|url=https://medium.com/@marceelias/listening-and-responding-to-calls-for-an-audit-and-recount-2a904717ea39|date=November 26, 2016|accessdate=November 26, 2016|work=[[Medium (website)|Medium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 28, the Wisconsin Elections Commission rejected Stein's request for a hand recount of all votes, and Stein sought to overturn the decision in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2608282/|title= Wisconsin commission rejects Stein request for recount by hand|work=Washington Examiner|author=Kyle Feldscher|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stein |first1=Jason |last2=Marley |first2=Patrick |title=Stein sues after Wisconsin refuses to order hand recounts |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/28/elections-staff-layout-recount-timeline/94539210/ |accessdate=November 29, 2016 |work=USA TODAY |date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, after Stein paid $3.5 million needed to initiate a recount, the Wisconsin Elections Commission ordered a recount in the state to begin on December 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Elections Commission Receives $3.5 million Payment from Stein Campaign for Presidential Election Recount|url=http://elections.wi.gov/node/4457|website=Wisconsin Elections Commission|accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, a Trump [[Super PAC]] filed a federal lawsuit to halt the recount in Wisconsin arguing that it fails the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s test for [[Equal Protection]] in the [[Florida election recount]] process established in [[Bush v. Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump super PAC files federal lawsuit to block Wisconsin recount|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-super-pac-wisconsin-recount-232121|publisher=Politico|date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge James Peterson denied the emergency halt to the recount, allowing the process to continue at least until a December 9 court hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walker considers change in recount law|website=JSonline.com|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/12/02/walker-considers-change-recount-law/94798548/|date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that hearing, Judge Petersen declined to halt the recount, noting that the process was nearly complete and there was virtually no chance that it would change the results of the election. While the lawsuit was not dismissed, Petersen said he would decide whether to do so within the next few days.&lt;ref name="Dec9ABC"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Latest: Judge to Rule Monday on Pennsylvania Recount|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/latest-michigan-court-members-recount-44086754|website=ABC News|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisconsin's recount was completed and its results certified early on December 12, well before the state-imposed 8:00pm deadline that same day. Clinton increased her vote total in the state by 713 votes, while Trump increased his by 844, widening his lead by 131 votes over the original November 8 count and reaffirming his victory there. Wisconsin Elections Commission Chairman Mark Thomsen stated that the recount had uncovered no evidence that any of the state's voting machines had been hacked or otherwise tampered with.&lt;ref name="WIResults"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters13"/&gt;

On December 2, Trump and the [[Republican Party of Pennsylvania]] asked a court to dismiss the recount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Donald Trump's Team Moves to Stop Jill Stein's Vote Recounts in 3 States|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/02/donald-trump-recount-wisconsin-pennsylvania-michigan-jill-stein/|publisher=Fortune|date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued Pennsylvania law does not permit a court-ordered recount, and a Green Party lawyer acknowledged that the lawsuit was without precedent in the state.&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Party drops bid for statewide Pennsylvania recount|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/03/green-party-drops-bid-for-statewide-pennsylvania-recount.html|publisher=Fox News|date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, Stein and the Green Party formally withdrew their lawsuit seeking a statewide recount in Pennsylvania, stating that they were unable to produce the required $1 million bond before the court-ordered deadline at 5:00pm on December 5, which would have followed a court hearing earlier that day on whether to proceed with the case.&lt;ref name="FN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jill Stein is dropping her lawsuit for a recount in Pennsylvania|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jill-stein-dropping-lawsuit-for-pennsylvania-recount-2016-12|publisher=Business Insider|date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, December 4, an attorney representing the Green Party declared the Party's intent to file a lawsuit in a federal court to force Pennsylvania to carry out a recount, asserting that such a step was necessary because the state court system was ill-equipped to handle the matter.&lt;ref name="switch"/&gt;

Green Party lawyers filed the federal lawsuit on December 5, asserting that Pennsylvania's legal barriers to a recount amounted to a violation of voters' constitutional rights and a recount should be compelled.&lt;ref name="Dec5"/&gt; U.S. District Judge [[Paul S. Diamond]] scheduled a hearing on the lawsuit for December 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge schedules hearing for Green Party's Pennsylvania recount push|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/politics/20161207_Judges_schedules_hearing_for_Green_Party_s_Pennsylvania_recount_push.html|publisher=Philly.com|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the hearing, lawyers for Stein presented testimony alleging that although poor polling was likely to blame for any deviations between election results and polls, the possibility of hacking could not be ruled out. A former Pennsylvania voting machine inspector testified on behalf of lawyers for the Republican Party that the situations put forward by Stein's experts were highly unlikely and lacked any supporting evidence. Judge Diamond himself expressed concerns that Pennsylvania's voters would be disenfranchised if the state's election results were not certified in time for the December 13 deadline due to a recount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pennsylvania recount decision expected Monday|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-pennsylvania-election-recount-federal-court-hearing-20161209-story.html|publisher=The Morning Call|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, Diamond rejected Stein and the Green Party's lawsuit, ending the recount effort in Pennsylvania and allowing the state to certify its original November 8 results.&lt;ref name="APDec12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters13"/&gt;

===Michigan===
{{see also|United States presidential election in Michigan, 2016}}
Stein filed for a manual recount in Michigan on November 30, paying the $973,250 fee required for filing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jill Stein files for Michigan recount|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/jill-stein-files-for-michigan-recount-232015|publisher=Politico|date=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recount policy in Michigan is to count every ballot manually.&lt;ref name="wiag"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.rt.com/usa/368490-wisconsin-agrees-to-ballot-recount/ |title=Wisconsin agrees to recount votes – but rejects Jill Stein’s hand recount request |accessdate=November 29, 2016 |date=November 28, 2016 |work=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A manual count is required because the machines used to vote have no [[audit trail]] features.&lt;ref name="sogu"/&gt;  According to Stein a recount in Michigan should have been pursued because of a "sky-high number of blank votes" for the presidency, since there were 87,810 ballots that were counted as not voting for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mack|first1=Julie|title=Michigan's 2016 presidential election by the numbers|url=http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/michigans_presidential_electio.html|accessdate=15 December 2017|date=Nov 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sogu"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/11/28/jill-stein-recount/94539238/ |title=State officials gear up for Michigan recount effort |last=Livengood |first=Chad  |accessdate=November 29, 2016 |date=November 28, 2016 |newspaper=The Detroit News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the money raised by Stein, [[Ruth Johnson]], the [[Michigan Secretary of State]], said that the recounting process might require up to $4 million of Michigan taxpayers' money.&lt;ref name="michiganmillions"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whio.com/news/national-govt--politics/taxpayers-the-hook-for-most-cost-michigan-recount/rTfjyXiVilDo7oKMBhkKnM/|title=Taxpayers on the hook for most of cost of Michigan recount|publisher=[[WHIO-TV]]|first=Jamie|last=Dupree|date=November 30, 2016|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, the Trump campaign challenged Michigan's recount arguing that the recount couldn't be finished on time and that Stein's petition wasn't properly [[notary|notarized]], delaying the planned recount which was to begin the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trump Campaign Objects To Michigan Hand Recount|url=http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2016/12/01/trump-campaign-objects-to-michigan-hand-recount/|publisher=CBS Detroit|date=December 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 2, with the Michigan's Board of State Canvassers [[Impasse|deadlocked]] 2-2, along party lines, the recount in Michigan was to proceed on December 6, barring court action, which [[Bill Schuette]] the [[Michigan Attorney General]] has requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Recount Goes Forward, Barring Court Intervention|url=http://patch.com/michigan/detroit/donald-trump-expected-contest-michigan-vote-recount|publisher=Detroit patch|date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after midnight on December 5, U.S. District Judge [[Mark A. Goldsmith]] ordered the recount in Michigan to begin at 12:00pm that day, bypassing a normally required waiting period of two days that would have caused the recount to begin on December 7. The timing of the recount had been the subject of a court hearing the previous day, in which lawyers representing Stein pushed for an immediate recount and lawyers for the Republican Party argued circumventing the waiting period was unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge orders Michigan presidential recount to begin at noon Monday|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/12/04/judge-holds-sunday-hearing-michigan-recount-suit/94952646/|publisher=The Detroit News|date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan election officials began the recount as ordered.&lt;ref name="Dec5"/&gt;

On December 6, the [[Michigan Court of Appeals]] declared that Stein had no standing to seek a recount because she finished fourth in the election, garnering 1% of the vote, and therefore did not qualify as an "aggrieved" candidate under state law. The court ordered the state election board to reject Stein's recount petition. Attorney General Schuette stated the court's decision meant the ongoing recount "must stop", but an attorney representing Stein insisted the recount would continue. Judge Goldsmith, whose earlier ruling ordering the recount to begin had dealt with only the timing of the recount and not whether it should proceed, called a hearing for the morning of December 7 to address Schuette's request to set aside his ruling in light of the state court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Recount Now in Doubt; Pennsylvania Sets Hearing 1|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/presidential-recount-michigan-expands-detroit-area-43999331|publisher=ABC News|date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Goldsmith deliberated after the hearing, the Michigan election board also met and decided to refrain from acting on the state court's ruling until Goldsmith had issued his new decision, and Stein appealed the state court's ruling to the [[Michigan Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Recount Now in Doubt; Pennsylvania Sets Hearing 2|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/michigan-recount-now-doubt-pennsylvania-sets-hearing-44027368|publisher=ABC News|date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsmith agreed to order the stoppage of the recount later that day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan vote recount halted after judge says Jill Stein has no legal standing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/07/us-election-recount-halted-michigan-jill-stein|publisher=theguardian|date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that while Stein's efforts had highlighted the vulnerability of Michigan's voting system to tampering, no evidence of such tampering had been presented, despite the evidence of Michigan's voting machines breaking down and not counting possibly over 87,000 votes for president that were not blank.&lt;ref name="TDNJudge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge’s order effectively suspends Michigan’s recount|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/07/judge-michigan-recount/95081650/|publisher=The Detroit News|date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 9, the Michigan Supreme Court denied Jill Stein's appeal to restart the recount in a 3-2 ruling, permitting the original November 8 election results to be certified.&lt;ref name="MISupreme"/&gt;

Prior to the halt of the recount, 3,047 precincts across 22 of [[List of counties in Michigan|Michigan's 83 counties]] had completed their recounts, which resulted in a net gain of 102 votes for Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Recount - Office: President of the United States|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/MIRecount_545037_7.pdf|website=Michigan.gov|date=December 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIDay1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Recount Results Day 1: Problems Found in Clinton Strongholds|url=http://heavy.com/news/2016/12/michigan-recount-results-day-1-update-missing-ballots-margin-laws-totals-detroit-ruling-update-wayne-county-rules/|website=Heavy.com|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nevada===
{{see also|United States presidential election in Nevada, 2016}}
On November 30, [[American Delta Party]]/[[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] presidential candidate [[Rocky De La Fuente]] requested a recount in five [[List of counties in Nevada|counties in Nevada]] and paid the $14,000 fee required for the effort.&lt;ref name="Nevada"/&gt; These counties were [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas]], [[Mineral County, Nevada|Mineral]], [[Nye County, Nevada|Nye]], and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark]], as well as the [[independent city]] of [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]]. De La Fuente called his recount request a counterbalance to the recount that Jill Stein sought in Wisconsin, and stated that while he did not expect to win Nevada, he was concerned about the integrity of the vote.&lt;ref name="4states"&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's the Latest in the Presidential Vote Recounts in 4 States|url=http://fortune.com/2016/12/05/presidential-vote-recount-wisconsin-michigan-pennsylvania-nevada/|website=Fortune.com|date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LVRJ"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Recount underway of some Nevada presidential ballots cast Nov. 8|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/recount-underway-some-nevada-presidential-ballots-cast-nov-8|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De La Fuente was entitled under state law to select a sample of 5% of Nevada's precincts to be recounted, totaling 93 precincts, but he selected only 92.&lt;ref name="LVRJ"/&gt; If the results from the sample revealed a discrepancy of 1% or more in favor of either De La Fuente or Hillary Clinton, who won the state on election day, a full statewide recount would have been launched.&lt;ref name="4states"/&gt; As De La Fuente won only 202 votes across the precincts he selected for the recount, a deviation of as little as 3 votes would have triggered a statewide recount, though [[Secretary of State of Nevada]] [[Barbara Cegavske]] would have had discretion to determine if a recount was warranted.&lt;ref name="LVRJ"/&gt;

The Nevada partial recount was completed on December 8. It resulted in no change in the number of votes cast for De La Fuente, but Clinton lost 9 votes and Trump lost 6 due to absentee ballot errors. The recount involved 93,840 ballots in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Partial recount of Nevadans’ presidential ballots confirms Nov. 8 results|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/partial-recount-nevadans-presidential-ballots-confirms-nov-8|publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NVResults"/&gt;

According to ''[[Politico]]'', many of Clinton's closest allies were "irritated with Jill Stein" and did not believe that the recount will change the election's results, though they did feel that they had an obligation to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Debenedetti |first=Gabriel |url= http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/hillary-clinton-state-recounts-reaction-jill-stein-231897 |title= Clinton team shrugs off recount effort |work=Politico |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate= November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stein's former [[running mate]] [[Ajamu Baraka]] opposed the recount efforts, writing in a [[Facebook]] post, "The recount effort has resulted in serious questions regarding the motivations of the recount that threatens to damage the standing and reputation of the Green Party, its supporters and activists". He also told [[CNN]], "It would be seen as carrying the water for the Democrats". The Green Party's [[Maryland Senate]] candidate Margaret Flowers circulated an open letter, which has signatures from many prominent Green Party members, opposing the recount. The letter read, "While we support electoral reforms, including how the vote is counted, we do not support the current recount being undertaken by Jill Stein".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Eli|title=Jill Stein's running mate: 'I'm not in favor of the recount'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/29/politics/green-party-recount-criticism/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 3, 2016|date=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A Great Night in Harlem''' Benefit Concert is an annual series of concerts organized by the [[Jazz Foundation of America]] (JFA), a [[501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]], since 2001 to raise money for the Jazz Foundation's Musician Emergency Fund.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}
In August 2000, after being hired as Executive Director of the Jazz Foundation, [[Wendy Oxenhorn]] discovered the organization had only {{US$|7,000}} left in the fund. She suggested organizing a fundraising concert at the [[Apollo Theater]]. When she was told they could not afford to rent the Apollo, Oxenhorn asked board member Jarrett Lilien for advice. Lilien told Oxenhorn he would pay to rent the Apollo.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Oxenhorn conceived of the idea for the concerts during her first year as Executive Director of the JFA in 2000, after watching a 1994 documentary called ''A Great Day in Harlem'' about jazz musicians. The first concert, which took place in September 2001, raised $350,000 for the foundation's Jazz Musicians Emergency Fund, and over 65 jazz artists performed. Every year since, the event has grown.&lt;ref name="Apollo 2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.nydailynews.com/new-york-ny/venues/show/11007-apollo-theater |title=Events and Entertainment Calendar|website=Events.nydailynews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, the Foundation's emergency caseload had tripled and they were now helping 150 musicians. [[Lauren Roberts]] joined the organization and together they ran it, handling an average of 10 cases a day. Because of the success of the A Great Night in Harlem, they initiated the Jazz in the Schools Program, which generated employment for more than 400 elderly musicians in New York City.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The annual A Great Night In Harlem concerts were the organization's was the only major funding source. Each year it, and the Foundation's caseload, grew{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Lilien and his partners at [[E-Trade]] Financial Corp. started the first Musicians Emergency Housing Fund, which enabled the Jazz Foundation to pay rents and keep mortgages from foreclosure. The Jazz Foundation of America was now able to support hundreds of elderly musicians who had fallen behind due to illness or age, preventing evictions and homelessness.&lt;ref name="A Great night in History"&gt;[http://www.jazzfoundation.org/ Jazz Foundation of America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921142515/http://www.jazzfoundation.org/ |date=2007-09-21 }}. 2009-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jarrett Lilien became the first president of the JFA. Within months, he was also made president of E-Trade Financial Corp. The Jazz Foundation had become a national organization. By 2009, they were handling approximately 500 emergency cases a year.

===2001===
On Monday, September 24, 2001, the JFA presented the first A Great Night in Harlem at the Apollo Theater on 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, at 7 p.m. The performance was MC'd by [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Gil Noble]], host of WABC-TV's Sunday television show ''[[Like It Is (TV series)|Like It Is]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nat Hentoff |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-08-21/news/a-great-night-in-harlem/ |title=A Great Night in Harlem |work=Village Voice |date=2001-08-21 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas'''" is the sixteenth episode of ''[[Family Guy]]''{{'}}s [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]]. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 21, 2001. In the episode, it is [[Christmas]] time in Quahog, a time when Lois's plans for a perfect holiday blow up in her face, causing her to have a mental breakdown. Stewie uses his role as the baby [[Jesus]] in the town play to be good for [[Santa Claus]], about whom he has become paranoid, and show Lois the true meaning of Christmas.

"A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas" was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and directed by Brian Hogan. Though the episode aired during the third season, it was a holdover from the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second production season]]. It featured guest performances from the original members of the rock band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] ([[Peter Criss]], [[Ace Frehley]], [[Gene Simmons]], and [[Paul Stanley]]).

It is rated as TV-14&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbs.com/shows/family-guy/season-3/episode-16/a-very-special-family-guy-freakin-christmas&lt;/ref&gt; and also sold as a DVD.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001N9VW5Y&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] signs [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] up to star as baby [[Jesus]] in a [[nativity scene]] at the Quahog [[Nativity play|Christmas pageant]]. Stewie plays along in hopes of pleasing [[Santa]], who he believes is [[omnipotent]] and thereby can supply him with [[plutonium]]. After Lois repeatedly reminds [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to donate a present to [[Charitable organization|charity]], he mistakenly donates all of the family's [[Christmas]] gifts to a needy kids' charity. Lois seems unfazed by the mistake, but insists that the entire family shop for new presents at the mall. Peter reluctantly agrees, although he only wants to watch ''[[Kiss (band)|KISS]] Saves Santa'' on television; [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] stays behind to keep an eye on the turkey cooking in the oven. While at the mall, Peter finds a pair of [[barrette]]s that [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] wanted and ends up chasing down an old lady to a pet fish store called "Age of Aquariums", where the old lady throws fish food on him so that all the fish jump onto him to feed while the old lady escapes.

Meanwhile, at home, an ember shoots onto the family rug from the [[fireplace]]. While Brian tries to deal with this crisis, the overcooked turkey begins to burn. Brian finds a [[fire extinguisher]], but to his dismay, it is merely a novelty item filled with [[Snake nut can|plastic snakes]], which, upon being released into the fire, promptly explode and make it worse. After using the real fire extinguisher, he slips on the foam from it and the TV falls on top of him. Afterwards the interior of the house is destroyed; Brian escapes, but with his paws burnt hairless. Amazingly, Lois maintains a cheerful attitude, saying that they just need to clean up a bit. However, when Meg tells her that they are out of [[paper towel]]s, Lois suffers a nervous breakdown and furiously screams at the family about how difficult it is to ensure that Christmas happens without a hitch, then runs from the ruined house on a rampage (Meg then ironically finds some paper towels mere seconds after Lois' rampage).

Lois storms through town, berating people for their [[Christmas]] [[optimism]]. When she reaches the town square, she climbs the [[Christmas tree]] there and grabs the ornamental star on top, bent on destroying it. The rest of the family arrives and Stewie, eager to perform a good deed to earn Santa's grace, performs an [[extemporaneous]] [[monologue]] about Jesus and the meaning of Christmas. Lois, watching Stewie, regains her sanity, but Peter, who thinks Lois isn't getting the message, allows the police to shoot her with a tranquilizer dart, just after she puts the star back on the tree.

The next morning at Christmas, the family opens their presents: Stewie gets his plutonium; Peter gets a week's vacation, a new [[VCR]], and his own copy of ''Kiss Saves Santa''; and Brian gets at what first appears to be a bottle of wine, but actually turns out to be a book. Lois is heavily [[sedated]], sitting limply in a rocking chair and drooling. In the closing scene, the Griffins wish everyone a Merry Christmas (though Lois is still too numb to speak clearly).&lt;ref name="C188"/&gt;

==Production==
The episode was originally intended to air in December 2000, as part of the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]]. However, it was shelved after the show was canceled for the first time, then reshuffled into the [[Family Guy (season 3)|third season]] when the show returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78785/kiss-kollected-for-4-disc-box-set|title=Kiss Kollected For 4 Disc Box Set|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
When Peter and Lois are at Joe's house, Peter points at their TV and says "You guys know that Rudolph is on, right?", a reference to the special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' which is telecast yearly. Peter is seen wanting to watch ''Kiss Saves Santa'', a fictional special whose plot involves the rock band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] saving Santa Claus from pterodactyls. Brian is seen watching ''[[Bob Hope television specials|Bob Hope's Christmas with the Troops]]'', a Christmas special featuring Bob Hope performing a monologue to a group of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] Union soldiers.&lt;ref name="C214"&gt;[[#FG|Callaghan]] (2005), p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; While Lois is marching through the city on a rampage, she runs into George Bailey from ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' and [[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]].

==Reception==
Alynda Wheat of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the episode 21 on her list of "26 Classic Holiday TV Episodes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20333218_6,00.html|title=26 Classic Holiday TV Episodes|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Wheat, Alynda|date=December 26, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adarsh Liberal''' (an Ideal Liberal) is a sarcastic term used on social media in [[India]] to describe a person who blindly opposes the policies of the Modi Government. The term came to be used on social media after the term ''Bhakt'' became popular to describe a person who blindly supports the policies of the [[Modi Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-31833682 |title=Indian liberals mocked - and mocking - online - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2015-03-11 |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a poster released on social media, ''Adarsh Liberal'' is  "someone who goes on an expensive holiday to discuss and understand poverty", and a person who "supports [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] but eats chicken and beef", "shifts goalposts if losing arguments", "questions Hindu mythology to become secular" etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adarshliberal-or-adarshbhakt-adarsh-liberal-cartoon-ignites-hashtag-war-on-twitter/article1-1325203.aspx |title=Adarsh Liberal vs Adarsh Bhakt: Hashtag war on Twitter |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/viral-memes-a-war-between-adarsh-liberal-and-adarsh-bhakt-on-twitter-745783 |title=Viral Memes: A War Between 'Adarsh Liberal' and 'Adarsh Bhakt' on Twitter |publisher=Ndtv.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/buzz/adarsh-liberal-vs-adarsh-sanghi-the-battle-of-ideologies-on-twitter-972620.html |title=Adarsh Liberal vs Adarsh Sanghi: The battle of ideologies on Twitter |publisher=IBNLive |date= |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abplive.in/india/2015/07/30/article668096.ece/An-open-letter-by-a-thulla-to-all-those-opposing-Yakub-Memons-capital-punishment |title=ABP Live - English News, Today’s Latest Breaking News in English, Online English News |publisher=Abplive.in |date=2015-07-30 |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a minor alteration of the old term ''Adarsh Balak'' which is used to make fun of [[Liberalism in India|Indian liberals]].{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Shovon Chowdhury |url=http://scroll.in/article/717655/is-scroll-in-a-nest-of-adarsh-liberals |title=Is Scroll.in a nest of Adarsh Liberals? |publisher=Scroll.in |date= |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fakingnews.firstpost.com/2015/08/pakistan-apologizes-to-adarsh-liberals-for-deterioration-in-quality-of-terrorists/ |title=Pakistan apologizes to Adarsh Liberals for deterioration in quality of terrorists &amp;#124; Faking News |publisher=Fakingnews.firstpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshareit.com/18-tweets-by-adarsh-liberals-who-didnt-want-yakub-memon-to-be-hanged/ |title=19 tweets by Adarsh Liberals who didn't want Yakub Memon to be hanged |publisher=Reshareit.com |date=2015-07-30 |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">The '''Alexandra Theatre''' was a theatre located in the [[Stoke Newington]] district of [[London]]. Built in 1897, it was located at 65 and 67 Stoke Newington Road where the present-day Alexandra Court now stands. The theatre was demolished in the 1960s.

==History==
Opened on December 27, 1897 as ''The Alexandra Theatre and Opera House'', it was designed by theatre architect [[Frank Matcham]] for F. W. Purcell. Upon opening, the theatre had a capacity of 2,025, spread across pit, traditional circle and gallery seating. In 1904, city records list the theatre’s capacity as 1,710, along with an assessed value of £1,250.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harper|first1=Edgar|title=Theatres and music halls : Return of all premises in the Administrative County of London licensed for public entertainments...|date=1904|publisher=J. Truscott and Son, Ltd.|location=London|pages=1|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiuc.2690587_001;view=1up;seq=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The theatre's first performance was the December 27, 1897 staging of ''Dick Whittington'', an adaption of the pantomime [[Dick Whittington and His Cat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Alexandra Theatre and Opera House, 65 &amp; 67 Stoke Newington Road, Stoke Newington"|url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/AlexandraTheatreStokeNewington.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was operated by F. W. Purcell until 1905 when he sold it to new owners. The theatre’s new owners changed its name to the Palace Theatre of Varieties. However, in 1909, it was sold again, this time to [[Moss Empires|Stoll Moss Empires, Ltd.]], who reverted it back to its original name, the Alexandra Theatre and placed it under the management of [[Oswald Stoll]]. In the late 1910s Stoll had screens, projectors and other equipment needed for cinema projection installed and by 1922 cine-variety programs were being presented to audiences. The theatre also presented film matinees and on Sundays, on which, by law, no live performances could be done, the theatre screened films exclusively.

In 1932, the Alexandra was purchased by Standard Cinema Properties Ltd. and converted to screen films exclusively. However, in 1934 the theatre came under independent management and, in addition to reverting to featuring a mixture of live and film performances, a modern (for the time) sound system was installed. A few years later, the theatre closed with the entry of the [[United Kingdom]] into [[World War II]]. 

The Alexandra reopened in 1945 after the war ended and subsisted on a variety of live performances, such as boxing matches, [[Yiddish theatre]] productions, and special events. During this period, the theatre hosted performances from the [[Motley Theatre Design Group]], including a 1947 staging of an adaptation of [[Hans Christian Andersen |Hans Christian Andersen's]] ''[[The Snow Queen]]'', adapted by [[Evgeny Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=King|url=https://digital.library.illinois.edu/items/647c7030-73cd-0134-1deb-0050569601ca-8|website=Motley Collection of Theatre and Costume Design}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alexandra remained open and staging productions and events until finally closing its doors for good in 1950. Thereafter, the building stood empty for many years before being demolished in the early 1960s so that the Alexandra Court tenement could be built.

The '''Appleby Horse Fair''' calls itself "an annual gathering of Gypsies and Travellers in the town of [[Appleby-in-Westmorland]] in [[Cumbria]], England."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.applebyfair.org/ |title=Appleby Horse Fair |publisher=Appleby Fair Strategic Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and location==
The [[horse fair]], also known as Appleby New Fair, is held each year in early June. It attracts about 10,000 Gypsies and Travellers, about 1000 caravans, several hundred horse-drawn vehicles, and about 30,000 visitors. Rather than an organised event with a set programme, it's billed as the biggest traditional Gypsy Fair in Europe, one that's like a big family get together. The horses are washed and trotted up and down the flashing lane most main days. There is a market on Jimmy Winter's Field selling a variety of goods - some traditional to the Gypsy travelling community - and a range other horse-related products. The Gypsy and Traveller attendees include British [[Romanichal]], [[Irish Travellers]], [[Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups]], [[Kale (Welsh Romanies)]], and more. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The fair is held outside the town of Appleby where the Roman Road crosses Long Marton Road, not far from Gallows Hill, named after the public hangings that were once carried out there. In the mid 20th century the story developed that the fair originated with a royal charter to the borough of Appleby from King [[James II of England]] in 1685.  However, recent research has shown that the 1685 charter, which was cancelled before it was enrolled, is of no relevance.  Appleby's medieval borough fair, held at [[Whitsuntide]], ceased in 1885.  The 'New Fair', held in early June on Gallows Hill, which was then unenclosed land outside the borough boundary, began in 1775 for sheep and cattle drovers and horse dealers to sell their stock; by the 1900s it had evolved into a major Gypsy/Traveller occasion. No-one bestowed the New Fair, no-one ever owned it, no-one was ever charged to attend it: it was and remains, a true people's fair.

The legal status of the Fair does not depend on a charter, therefore, but on the legal concept of 'prescriptive right,' that is to say [[easement by prescription]] or [[custom (law)|custom]]. ''Praescriptio est titulus ex usu et tempore substanniam capiens ab auctoritate legis.'' 'Prescription is a title by authority of law, deriving its force from use and time.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cumbriapast.com/cgi-bin/ms/main.pl?action=publications&amp;pub_id=83|title=Appleby Gypsy Horse Fair: Mythology, Origins, Evolution and Evaluation |author=Andrew Connell |date=2015 |publisher=Cumberland &amp; Westmorland Antiquarian &amp; Archaeological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The fair is a regular but spontaneous gathering, and is not organised by any individual or group, although the Gypsies and Travellers have a ''Shera Rom'' (Head Romani) who arranges toilets, rubbish skips, water supplies, horse grazing etc., and acts as liaison with the local authority co-ordinating committee (Multi-Agency Strategic Co-ordinating Group, or MASCG) which manages the public authorities' response to the Fair.

The fair has no organised or scheduled events. The main activities take place on Fair Hill (the main campsite field, with some catering and trade) and more recently on the Market Field, which was opened up by a local farmer about 10 years ago, and is now the main stall trading and catering area. There are half a dozen licensed campsites and car parks nearby. Most horse trading takes place at the crossroads (known to the local authority as 'Salt Tip Corner') and on Long Marton Road (known to the Gyspies and Travellers as the ‘flashing lane’), where horses are shown off (or ‘flashed’ ) by trotting up and down at speed. (The flashing lane is not suitable for anyone of limited mobility, such as the infirm, the very old or the very young, due to the risks associated with horses travelling at speed, and spectators are strongly advised to keep behind the barriers.)

Many of the horses are taken down to ‘the Sands’, near the Appleby town centre beside the [[River Eden (Cumbria)|River Eden]], where horses are ridden into the river to be washed, and it is not unusual to see scores of horses tied up opposite The Grapes public house. The highway at that location is closed to vehicle traffic for the main days of the fair, which are now the Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

The fair customarily ends on the second Wednesday in June, and starts on the Thursday before that. Although the last Tuesday was once the main horse dealing day, due to the growth of the market field and the large number of visitors, the main day is now the Saturday, and it is all over by the Monday morning.

Besides the horses, there are fortune tellers, palm readers, buskers and music stalls, clothing stalls, tools and hardware, china, stainless steel, and horse-related merchandise including harness and carriages.

==Controversy==
The horse fair generates some controversy with complaints of mess being left in the town,&lt;ref name="TheIndependent_20130606"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/vibrant-slice-of-life-or-annual-invasion-the-appleby-horse-fair-rides-again-8648430.html |title=Vibrant slice of life or annual invasion?

The Local Authority (Eden District Council, which convenes the Multi-Agency Strategic Co-Ordinating Group to manage the official response to the fair) is required to deal with these matters, and their official sources provide a context for these controversial issues. (See below)

In 2014 there were 28 arrests at the fair, the lowest for several years (for among other things, drug use, drunkenness, and obstruction), which senior police have confirmed is not disproportionate to other large-scale public events. In 2015, this number came down further, with only 15 arrests over the whole fair, for what the police described as 'mostly low level disorder. During the 2018 Fair there were 7 arrests, including one arrest for a previously issued warrant. The number of caravans in the Eden District in 2018 was signifiantly higher, approximately 20% up on 2017. '&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.newsandstar.co.uk/news/record-low-for-arrests-as-appleby-horse-fair-ends-1.1217194]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards rubbish and clean-up costs, although the trade stands leave a few tons of waste, the market field and Fair Hill are cleaned of litter the day after the fair, at no cost to the ratepayers, and within a week there is hardly a trace that a fair has been held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-27821309|title=Few arrests at annual horse fair|date=12 June 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/news/13317696.Appleby_Horse_Fair_draws_to_a_close/|title=Appleby Horse Fair draws to a close|website=The Westmorland Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MASCG Committee reported that improvements in provision of litter bins, signage etc. had resulted a reduction in the number of tonnes of litter from 43 tonnes to 29 tonnes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.applebyfair.org/sites/default/files/attachments/150622_Notes.pdf|title=Meeting minutes |website=www.applebyfair.org|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As regards animal cruelty, the [[RSPCA]] patrols the fair scrupulously, and although in 2009 [[Animal Aid]] called for the fair to be banned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/NEWS/news_other/ALL/2144//| title=Appleby Horse Fair - Time to call a halt to this festival of animal abuse| date=15 June 2009| access-date=13 March 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122745/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/NEWS/news_other/ALL/2144//| archive-date=2 April 2015| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless the instances of cruelty are few, and they are prosecuted where they do occur.  Warnings and advice are given in borderline cases, and the very great majority of horses at the fair are well looked after, well treated, and in good condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fewer incidents at Appleby Horse Fair but many more warnings given|url = http://www.cumbriacrack.com/2012/06/14/fewer-incidents-at-appleby-horse-fair-but-many-more-warnings-given/|accessdate = 2015-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the RSPCA stated unequivocally that although there were some welfare issues, mostly brought about by the hot weather, the Fair is a large-scale event and it is only a small minority of people who attend the fair that have little regard for animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.applebyfair.org/news/appleby-horse-fair-2016-round |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611154724/http://applebyfair.org/news/appleby-horse-fair-2016-round |archivedate=11 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post Operation Blue Star==
Operation Blue Star had a wide impact on politics in India as many Sikh youths joined the [[Khalistan movement]].  Indira Gandhi was unpopular among Sikhs due to her role in the operation, which had destroyed and damaged portions of the [[Akal Takht]] and caused massive casualties among Sikh pilgrims. Sikh sensibilities were also offended at the alleged entry of army personnel with boots into the temple complex and the alleged destruction of Sikh scriptures and manuscripts in the temple library that caught fire due to explosives used during the operation. Such claims and other rumours led to an atmosphere of mistrust towards the government and ended in a conspiracy to assassinate Gandhi. This occurred within four months of the conclusion of the operation.&lt;ref name="dnaindia_tryst"/&gt;

The perception of threat to Gandhi's life increased after the operation. Accordingly, Sikhs were removed from her personal bodyguard by the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] due to the fear of assassination. However, Gandhi was of the opinion that this would reinforce her anti-Sikh image among the public and strengthen her political opponents. She ordered the [[Special Protection Group]] to reinstate her Sikh bodyguards, including Beant Singh who was reported to be her personal favourite.&lt;ref name="dnaindia_tryst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-operation-blue-star-india-s-first-tryst-with-militant-extremism-2270293|title=Operation Blue Star: India's first tryst with militant extremism  - Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=5 November 2016|website=Dnaindia.com|accessdate=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103012225/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-operation-blue-star-india-s-first-tryst-with-militant-extremism-2270293|archive-date=3 November 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination==
[[File:PathOfMartyrdom.JPG|thumb|210px|The spot where Indira Gandhi was shot down is marked by a glass opening in the crystal pathway at the Indira Gandhi Memorial.]]
At about 9:20 a.m. Indian Standard Time on 31 October 1984, Gandhi was on her way to be interviewed by British actor [[Peter Ustinov]] who was filming a documentary for Irish television. She was walking through the garden of the Prime Minister's Residence at No. 1 Safdarjung Road in New Delhi towards the neighboring 1 Akbar Road office.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web |title=25 years after Indira Gandhi's assassination |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-and-indira-25-years-after-a-pms-assassination/104183-37.html |date=30 October 2009 |publisher=[[CNN-IBN]] |access-date=5 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104180327/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/india-and-indira-25-years-after-a-pms-assassination/104183-37.html |archive-date=4 November 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She passed a wicket gate guarded by Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, and the two men opened fire. Beant Singh fired three rounds into her abdomen from his .38 revolver,&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; then Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds from his Sten submachine gun after she had fallen to the ground.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; Both men then threw down their weapons and Beant Singh said, "I have done what I had to do. You do what you want to do." In the next six minutes, Border Police officers Tarsem Singh Jamwal and Ram Saran captured and killed Beant Singh. Satwant Singh was arrested by Gandhi's other bodyguards along with an accomplice trying to escape; he was seriously wounded.&lt;ref name=tdaily&gt;{{cite news |title=Questions still surround Gandhi assassination |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w1seAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BMgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1354,5824409&amp;dq=assassination+of+indira+gandhi&amp;hl=en |accessdate=19 January 2013 |newspaper=Times Daily |date=24 November 1984 |agency=AP |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satwant Singh was hanged in 1989 with accomplice [[Kehar Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Sangat Kr.

==Death==
[[File:IndiraGandhi-SareeAtTimeOfDeath.JPG|200px|thumb|Gandhi's blood-stained saree and her belongings at the time of her assassination, preserved at the Indira Gandhi Memorial Museum in [[New Delhi]].]]
Gandhi was taken to the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences in New Delhi at 9:30 a.m., where doctors operated on her. She was declared dead at 2:20 p.m. The postmortem examination was conducted by a team of doctors headed by [[Tirath Das Dogra]], who stated that 30 bullets had struck Gandhi from a Sterling sub-machine gun and a revolver. The assailants had fired 33 bullets at her, of which 30 had hit; 23 had passed through her body, while seven remained inside. Dogra extracted bullets to establish the identity of the weapons and to correlate each weapon with the bullets recovered by ballistic examination. The bullets were matched with respective weapons at CFSL Delhi. Her body was taken in a gun carriage through Delhi roads on the morning of 1 November to [[Teen Murti Bhavan]] where her father stayed and where she layed in state.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; She was cremated on 3 November near [[Raj Ghat and associated memorials|Raj Ghat]], a memorial to [[Mahatma Gandhi]], at an area named ''Shakti Sthal''. Her elder son and successor [[Rajiv Gandhi]] lit the pyre.

==Aftermath==
Over the next four days, thousands of Sikhs were killed in retaliatory [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi to reopen inquiry in to massacre of Sikhs in 1984 riots|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/10607451/Delhi-to-reopen-inquiry-in-to-massacre-of-Sikhs-in-1984-riots.html| first=Dean |last=Nelson |date=2014-01-30 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=3 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Justice Thakkar Commission (headed by Justice [[Manharlal Pranlal Thakkar]]) of Inquiry set up to probe Indira Gandhi's assassination recommended a separate probe for the conspiracy angle behind the assassination. The Thakkar Report stated that the "needle of suspicion" pointed at [[R. K. Dhawan]] for complicity in the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890415-thakkar-commission-report-leak-govt-try-to-accuse-arun-nehru-of-being-the-main-culprit-815980-1989-04-15 |title=Thakkar Commission report leak: Govt try to accuse Arun Nehru of being the main culprit |first=Prabhu |last=Chawla |date=April 15, 1989 |magazine=[[India Today]] |accessdate=2018-10-30 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satwant Singh and alleged conspirator [[Kehar Singh]] were sentenced to death. Both were executed on 6 January 1989.

The '''Bali Kite Festival''' is an annual international [[kite]] festival held in July in Padang Galak area, [[Sanur, Bali|Sanur]] Beach, [[Bali]]. Traditional giant [[kites]] (4 metres in width and almost 10 metres in length) are made and flown competitively by teams from the villages (''banjar'') of [[Denpasar]]. The event is a seasonal religious festival intended to send a thanking message to the [[Hindu gods]] to create abundant crops and harvests.&lt;ref name="SCMP2013a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Songs of the skies|date=17 March 2013||access-date=10 September 2018|first=Jeremy|last=Torr|publisher=[[South China Morning Post]]|url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1189774/songs-skies|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319132918/https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1189774/songs-skies|archive-date=19 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams consist of about 70 to 80 people, each team with its own Gamelon band, flag bearers and flyers.

Bebean (fish-shaped), Janggan (bird-shaped) and Pecukan (leaf-shaped) are three traditional kites flown during this kite festival. The kites are flown by teams of 10 or more adult kitefliers. The Bebean is the largest kite, and looks like a broad-mouthed, split-tailed fish. The Janggan form has a broad flowing cloth tail that can reach more than 100 metres in length. 

The Pecukan requires the most skill to fly, as its unstable form often tumbles towards the ground. Red, white and black are traditional colours used in the kite's designs. Each type of traditional kite has its own competition, with heats of 10 teams vying for the best launch and longest flight. Sometimes the kites come down over the adjacent rice paddies, and the team members have to dash through the paddy to rescue the kite before it lands in the water.

A competition is also held for 'New Creation' (''kreasi baru'') kites which may include detailed three-dimensional figures representing the [[Hindu Gods]] or sponsorship kites. Traditional and new creation kites are constructed from bamboo and cotton cloth.

In the dry season of June through August, the winds blow continually from east to west in most of Indonesia. Balinese children and adults fly kites in the vacant rice paddies during this period. 

A [[gamelan]] orchestra plays music throughout the festival. The festival attracts many tourists and international kitefliers, along with many local spectators.

'''Baron 52''' was the call sign of a United States Air Force [[EC-47]] carrying eight crew members that was shot down over [[Laos]] during the predawn hours of 5 February 1973, a week after the [[Paris Peace Accords]] officially ended the United States involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Oregon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francis|first1=Mike|title=Still seeking answers about Joseph Matejov and many others missing in war|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2014/01/still_seeking_answers_about_jo.html|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=The Oregonian|date=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of four crewmen were recovered from the crash site, but those of the remaining four have never been found. Although the U.S. government considers them to have been [[killed in action]] and as late as 1996 listed them as "accounted for", family members and POW/MIA advocates believe the four survived the crash and were taken captive and possibly sent to the USSR.&lt;ref name="SandS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Matthew M.|title=Lynn O'Shea, advocate for POW/MIA families, dies at 65|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/lynn-o-shea-advocate-for-pow-mia-families-dies-at-65-1.383166|accessdate=9 February 2016|work=Stars and Stripes|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yurick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yurick|first1=Terry|title=AP Alley|date=2014|publisher=Lulu Enterprises Inc|isbn=1483407101|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVynAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=F_weU1paL-&amp;sig=2oeSSR17P7ylWtxoAG9_X448gqM&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPr960r-_KAhUNzGMKHT-fB6sQ6AEITDAL&amp;q=unsolved%20mysteries%20baron%2052|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intelligence gatherers and their equipment would have been highly valued by the Soviets who maintained a presence both in Laos and North Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Sauter" /&gt; The incident has been featured on several nationwide news programs and a [[List of Unsolved Mysteries episodes#Season 4 (1991-92)|1991 episode]] of the U.S. television series ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baron 52|url=http://unsolved.com/archives/baron-52|website=Unsolved Mysteries|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yurick /&gt; More recent research by the [[National Alliance of Families for the Return of America's Servicemen]] presented to Congress has prompted a status review of the incident scheduled to take place in 2016.&lt;ref name=SandS /&gt;{{Update|Introduction|date=October 2018}}

==The mission==
Although the Paris Peace Accords had officially ended the United States' direct role in the Vietnam War, only a week after its signing the U.S. Air Force sent an EC-47Q electronic warfare collection aircraft on a night-time radio-direction-finding mission to monitor the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]] and locate North Vietnamese tanks moving south. The plane, tail number 43-48636, belonged to the [[361st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron]] and began its mission from [[Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base]]. The flight crew also were part of the 361st while the collection crew manning the rear of the plane were from Det 3, 6994th Security Squadron.&lt;ref name="SecSquad"&gt;{{cite web|title=Baron 52|url=http://6994th.com/?page_id=123|website=6994th Security Squadron|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over Laos, the plane began taking anti-aircraft fire and went down in [[Salavan Province]], Laos about {{convert|50|mi}} east of the city of [[Salavan (city)|Salavan]] and {{convert|20|mi}} from the border with [[South Vietnam]] at a site in the jungle within {{convert|8|mi}} of three major roads leading into North Vietnamese-held territory.

==Recovery efforts==
The location of the wreckage was first discovered by U.S. Air Force search and rescue on 7 February 1973. The plane was determined to have crashed inverted, coming to rest upside down in the jungle; both wings had been sheared off. A team consisting of three [[United States Air Force Pararescue|pararescuemen]] and an intelligence expert were on the ground for approximately an hour and found three bodies in the charred wreckage, those of Spitz, Prim and Bollinger in the cockpit, still strapped in their seats. Outside of the wreckage, they found Lt. Bernhardt's body. In the rear of the plane they observed that the jump door had been removed (it was never located), the crew's safety belts were unbuckled, and all of the top secret sensitive equipment was missing as were the rear crew's parachutes.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TFOorg"&gt;{{cite web|title=MATEJOV, JOSEPH ANDREW "JOE"|url=http://taskforceomegainc.org/m194.html|website=TaskForceOmegaInc.org|publisher=Task Force Omega, Inc. 501 (c) (3)|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February 1973, Bernhardt's remains were recovered and positively identified four days later. On 22 February, the other seven men were declared killed in action despite no confirmation of the fates of the four members of the collection crew.&lt;ref name="TFOorg" /&gt;

==Controversy==
The families of the missing crew members believe there is evidence they bailed out and were taken captive by the [[North Vietnamese Army]] (NVA). They point to information in official reports, such as the fact that their safety belts were unbuckled and their remains were not at the crash site, to support their beliefs that the rear crew had time to bail out.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt; In addition, at approximately 8:00 AM on 5 February, U.S. Intelligence listening post at [[Phu Bai Combat Base]] in South Vietnam intercepted NVA communications from the area indicating they were transporting four captured Airmen. Such communications continued to be intercepted for the next three months. Also on record is a [[Pathet Lao]] radio intercept regarding four "air pirates" captured the day Baron 52 was shot down; no other U.S. aircraft was downed that day. A Laotian operative secretly working for the U.S. reported observing the transport of four prisoners along the road near the crash site.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt; All of these records remained classified by the U.S. government. This evidence was first presented to the American public by columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] on the U.S. news program ''[[Good Morning America]]'' in 1978. During Anderson's report, he stated a "Pentagon spokesman now agrees there's a good chance these four men were survivors of the crash. Yet, the Pentagon deliberately gave the families misinformation".&lt;ref name=House95&gt;Subcommittee, United States. Congress. House. Committee On National Security. Military Personnel.

In 1992, in front of the [[Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs]], a representative of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified that it was the government's position that these reports were unrelated to Baron 52; this testimony was repeated in 1994 before the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=House94&gt;{{cite web|title=Full text of "POW/MIA, where do we go from here: hearing before the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, One Hundred Third Congress, second session, February 10, 1994|url=https://archive.org/stream/powmiawheredoweg00unit/powmiawheredoweg00unit_djvu.txt|website=archive.org|publisher=The Internet Archive|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1992, the Lao government allowed a team to survey the crash site where a [[dogtag]] with Sgt. Matejov's name on it was found, after nearly 20 years, lying in plain sight. Also recovered were 23 bone fragments and half of a tooth which were taken to the [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command|Central Identification Laboratory]] in Hawaii, where [[Ellis R. Kerley]] publicly stated that the bone fragments "can not be proven conclusively to be human." According to further testimony given before the House Subcommittee by [[Albert Santoli]], Kerley was replaced by "a U.S. Army Lt. Colonel, professionally a dentist, who has limited forensic experience",&lt;ref name=House94 /&gt; and the bone fragments were declared to be the remains of all seven of the remaining crew members. The families requested DNA analysis be done on the bone fragments and tooth, but their requests were denied by the government.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt;

On 27 March 1996, the bone fragments were interred at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in a group burial. The families of all seven men attended although the families of the four rear crew members were there to "honor the sacrifice" of the flight crew and did not believe the bone fragments were those of Melton, Matejov, Cressman or Brandenburg.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt;  Matejov's younger brother, John Matejov, has sought help from both Wyoming Senators and Congressmen in petitioning the Pentagon for further information as well as appealing directly to President Obama.&lt;ref name="Oregon" /&gt; Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Roger Shields said the government "acted 'precipitously' to declare Matejov and the other three missing crew members to be dead".&lt;ref name= Oregon /&gt; In their book, ''The Men We Left Behind'', Mark Sauter and Jim Sanders wrote that "The names were scratched from the list (of MIAs) because they were an inconvenience that would have complicated Henry Kissinger's life".&lt;ref name="Sauter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sauter|first1=Mark|last2=Sanders|first2=Jim|title=The men we left behind: Henry Kissinger, the politics of deceit and the tragic fate of POWs after the Vietnam War|date=1993|publisher=National Press Book|location=University of Wisconsin - Madison|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3fxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=they+were+an+inconvenience+that+would|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]] negotiated the Paris Peace Accords and was responsible for carrying out President Nixon's promise to bring all [[Prisoner of War|POWs]] home.&lt;ref name="WashPost"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lippman|first1=Thomas W.|title=MYSTERY OF THE LAST FLIGHT OF BARON 52 SOLVED|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/12/10/mystery-of-the-last-flight-of-baron-52-solved/dad9c028-daca-46bc-a25f-87fffe1e5051/|accessdate=11 February 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=10 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further alleged that "the men weren't dead, and the Pentagon knew it" and that it was covered up because the flight was illegal under the Paris agreement.&lt;ref name=WashPost /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9922">'''Brandjacking''' is an activity whereby someone acquires or otherwise assumes the online identity of another entity for the purposes of acquiring that person's or business's [[brand equity]]. The term combines the notions of 'branding' and '[[wikt:hijacking|hijacking]]', and has been used since at least 2007 when it appeared in ''[[Business Week]]'' referencing the term used in a publication by the firm [[MarkMonitor]] (MarkMonitor and its PR firm, the Zeno Group, coined the phrase; MarkMonitor registered the trademark, BrandJacking Index®, but left brandjacking as a term for use in the public domain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = 'Brandjacking' on the Web

  | accessdate = 2010-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tactic is often associated with use of individual and corporate identities on [[social media]] or [[Web 2.0]] sites, as described in Quentin Langley's 2014 book ''Brandjack'',&lt;ref name=Brandjack&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langley|first1=Quentin|title=Brandjack|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=9781137375353}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and may be used alongside more conventional (offline) campaign activities.

While similar to [[cybersquatting]], [[identity theft]] or [[phishing]] in nature and in possible tactics, brandjacking is usually particular to a politician, celebrity or business and more indirect in its nature. A brandjacker may attempt to use the reputation of its target for selfish reasons or seek to damage the reputation of its target for hostile,&lt;ref name=Waddington&gt;{{cite book|last=Waddington|first=Steven|title=Brand Anarchy: Managing corporate reputation|year=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury|isbn=9781408157220|page=94}} Waddington, quoting Quentin Langley's ''[http://www.brandjacknews.com Brandjack News]'', describes brandjacking as "the ability for an individual to criticise and publicly shame a company ... [placing] the brand in a hostile relationship with the consumer."&lt;/ref&gt; malicious or for political or campaigning reasons. These reasons may not be directly financial, but the effects on the original brand-holder may often include financial loss - for example, negative publicity may result in the termination of a celebrity's sponsorship deal, or, for a corporation, potentially lead to lost sales or a reduced share price.

==Brandjacking examples==
* [[Coca-Cola]] - in 2013, a commercial, "The Bitter Taste of Sugar", for [[Oxfam]] ([[Oxfam Novib]] Netherlands) parodied a Coca-Cola Zero commercial, drawing attention to its unsustainable business practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfamnovib.nl/De-bittere-nasmaak-van-suiker.html De bittere nasmaak van suiker] Accessed: 7 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Starbucks]] - in 2006, a [[YouTube]]-hosted video presented a spoof advert for a Starbucks Frappuccino underlining the contrast between consumption and poverty.
* [[Nestle]] - in March 2010, [[Greenpeace]] campaigners used a YouTube video that parodied Nestlé's [[KitKat]] 'Take a Break' advertising, to draw attention to the multinational's use of palm oil from unsustainable operations in [[Indonesia]] and the consequent impact on [[Orangutan]] habitats.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlevy, Gabrielle (18 March 2010), Gory Greenpeace KitKat video goes viral, ''Daily Telegraph'' - http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/gory-greenpeace-kitkat-video-goes-viral/story-e6freuy9-1225842479332&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters outside Nestlé's UK head office in [[Croydon]] carried signs with the words 'Give me a break' and 'Killer' printed in the distinctive red and white [[Gill Sans]].&lt;ref name=metro&gt;Nestlé faces KitKat boycott over links to 'palm oil killing orangutans' claim (18 March 2010), ''Metro'' - http://www.metro.co.uk/news/818000-nestle-faces-kitkat-boycott-over-links-to-palm-oil-killing-orangutans-claim&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Exxon Mobil]] - in 2008, a [[Twitter]] account (@ExxonMobilCorp) was set up purporting to be the views of an official spokesperson for the oil company, only for it later to be exposed as fake.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Tom (2008), Exxon Mobil says it's not behind 'its' Twitter account, ''Houston Chronicle'' - http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/5920513.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also on Twitter, @BPglobalPR is not an official voice for [[BP]], but a satirical account that has grown in popularity during the 2010 [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], attracting more followers than the official BP Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;BP’s Global PR vs. BPGlobalPR (2010) ''Newsweek'' - http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/04/bp-s-global-pr-vs-bpglobalpr.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* Politicians - fake [[Facebook]] pages were created for US President [[Barack Obama]]&lt;ref&gt;Tapper, Jake (2008), Barack Obama's Fake Facebook Page (Courtesy of the RNC), ABC News - http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/07/barack-obamas-f.html&lt;/ref&gt; and US Republican governor [[Sarah Palin]]&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Palin's Facebook Alter-Ego Gets Found Out (29 August 2009) ''Wall Street Journal'' - https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2009/08/13/sarah-palins-facebook-alter-ego-gets-found-out/&lt;/ref&gt; (among other politicians). Major corporations have also been the subject of brandjack-based protests on Facebook.
* [[Fake blog]]s - may be considered a form of brandjacking if created by a critic or opponent of the person or brand supposed to be behind the blog.
* Affiliate Brand Bidding - This is a tactic used by some affiliate marketers. Some consider such tactics unethical or [[Black hat hacking|Black Hat]].

== Brandjacking avoidance ==
Brandjacking avoidance may include:
* Pre-emptive registration of brand names and sub-brands as screen names on social media sites.
* Staying vigilant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Use of social media and general media monitoring tools to seek evidence of infringement
* Legal action against those seen as responsible for the infringement.
However, action against the brandjackers and their supporters can actually draw attention to the problem (the [[Streisand effect]]). For example, following Greenpeace's KitKat campaign, Nestlé had the video removed from YouTube, but Greenpeace quickly re-posted it to video-sharing site [[Vimeo.com]] and highlighted the attempted censorship using Twitter and other social media.&lt;ref name=metro /&gt; Attempts by Nestlé to constrain user activity on its Facebook fan page further fanned the controversy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4379">The '''Brescia explosion''' occurred in 1769 in [[Brescia]] (now part of [[Italy]]) when a large store of gunpowder exploded after a lightning strike, causing extensive destruction and many deaths.   Claims that as many as 3,000 people died in the explosion (which may be an exaggeration), places the event high on [[List of accidents and disasters by death toll|lists of accidents and disasters by death toll]].

==The explosion==

On August 18, 1769, the city of [[Brescia]] in northern [[Italy]] was devastated when the Bastion of San Nazaro was struck by lightning.  The resulting fire ignited about 90,000 kg (or about 200,000 lb) of gunpowder stored there by the [[Republic of Venice]], causing a massive explosion.  Huge stones were hurled in a radius of a kilometer around the explosion, landing on people, houses, and church buildings including [[Santi Nazaro e Celso, Brescia|Santi Nazaro e Celso]].  Doors of houses and shops and city gates were thrown open, and broken glass showered down.&lt;ref name="bresciadeaths"/&gt;

This explosion destroyed about one-sixth of the city.&lt;ref name="mfone"&gt;Newton, Sara (22 December 2008).

Scipione Garbelli's ''Le Rovine di Brescia'' was published in 1771 and documented the tragedy.&lt;ref name="book1"&gt;[http://www.bresciacity.it/ma-che-successe-quella-notte-del-18-agosto-1769/ Ma che successe la notte del 18 agosto 1769?], bresciacity.it, Retrieved 13 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

The Roman Catholic Church withdrew its religious objection to [[lightning rod]]s after the event.&lt;ref name="elec"&gt;Baigrie, Brian. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3XEc5xkWxi4C&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Electricity and Magnetism: A Historical Perspective], p. 42 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain reacted to the tragedy by passing laws governing the private manufacture and storage of gunpowder.&lt;ref name="mfone"/&gt;  In determining how to protect the British government stores, [[Benjamin Franklin]] advised the use of pointed lightning rods, and prevailed in a debate over whether pointed rods or blunt rods should be used.&lt;ref name="franklin1"&gt;Miller, Brandon Marie. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vIwln8HU3C8C&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Benjamin Franklin, American Genius], p. 72 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The memory of the tragedy long remained with the people of the city.  The fire and noise caused by the fall of a meteorite in nearby [[Alfianello]] in 1883 are said to have immediately caused recall of the long ago explosion.&lt;ref name="bresciadeaths"/&gt;

'''Brexit and arrangements for science and technology''' refers to arrangements affecting scientific research, experimental development and innovation that are within the scope of the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the terms of [[Brexit|Britain's withdrawal from the European Union]] (EU).

At the time of passing the [[European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017|European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017]] in March 2017, the terms of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s disengagement were unknown. The outlook was uncertain for the future funding of British scientific research and for the UK's future relationship, as a third country, with the EU for patent protection of innovation, trade in medium- and high-tech goods and industrial contracts issued by European scientific institutions. Opinions differed on whether scientific research and development would be affected by a loss of mobility and international collaboration, or whether Britain's withdrawal from the EU should be seen as an opportunity to expand scientific collaboration.

==Background==
===Negotiating policy===
Following the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum vote]] to leave the European Union, the UK government started [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|the withdrawal process]] on 29 March 2017, to begin negotiating the future arrangements which would have effect after the withdrawal.

The government's negotiating policy at that time was stated in a [[white paper]], published in February 2017, ''The United Kingdom’s exit from and new partnership with the European Union'',&lt;ref&gt;''The United Kingdom’s exit from and new partnership with the European Union'', Cm 9417 [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589191/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Web.pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; that explicitly mentioned remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners. The white paper mentioned in more general terms: controlling the number of EU nationals coming to the UK; securing the status of EU citizens who are already living in the UK, and that of UK nationals in other member states; protecting and enhancing existing workers’ rights; forging a new partnership with the EU, including a wide reaching free trade agreement, and seeking a mutually beneficial new customs agreement with the EU; and forging free trade relationships across the world.

From the beginning, policy requirements influencing or determining the withdrawal negotiation were expressed in the Preamble&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Preamble|title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Consolidated_version_of_the_Treaty_on_European_Union/Title_I:_Common_Provisions|title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Treaty on European Union]] (TEU). Article 3 mentions the promotion of "scientific and technological advance" in a context governed by the Union's aims for [[European Single Market|an internal market]], and a highly competitive [[social market economy]]. A policy requirement mentioned in the Preamble is promoting economic and social progress for the peoples of the EU member states, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection.

International staff make up 25% of the overall workforce, 39% of academics and 48% of staff on research-only contracts at Russell Group universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://russellgroup.ac.uk/media/5522/rg-international-staff-june-2017-final-2.pdf|title=The value of international staff at Russell Group universities.

Over the period 2008–2014, the UK produced 15% of the world's most highly cited articles for a share of just 4% of the global research pool.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Between 2008 and 2014, 56% of scientific articles published in the UK in internationally catalogued journals had at least one co-author who was based outside the country, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). The majority of these articles were co-authored by Americans (100,537), followed by German, French, Italian and Dutch scientists. These four European countries  accounted for a total of 159,619 articles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=European Union: In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Hollanders|first=Hugo|last2=Kanerva|first2=Minna|publisher=UNESCO|year=|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=262, 268–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding of research in science and engineering===
{{See also|Research Funding in the UK}}
Britain's overall research intensity, measured as a percentage of [[gross domestic product]], is  comparatively low: 1.63% of GDP in 2013, compared to the EU average of 2.02%. The UK's business enterprise sector performs two-thirds of the total. In 2015, Britain's scientific establishment expressed concern that 'UK investment in research was failing to keep pace with other leading nations and risks eroding the capacity to attract and retain the very best researchers from the UK and overseas'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/2015/stronger-future/|title=Building a Stronger Future: Research, Innovation and Growth.|last=Royal Society|first=|last2=Academy of Medical Sciences|last3=British Academy|last4=Royal Academy of Engineering|publisher=Royal Society|year=2015|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an EU member state, the UK participates in the [[European Research Area]] and it is considered likely that the UK would wish to remain an associated member of the European Research Area, like Norway and Iceland, in order to continue participating in the EU framework programmes.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;"It is likely that the UK would wish to remain an associated member of the European Research Area, like Norway and Iceland, in order to continue participating in the EU framework programmes."{{Cite book |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf |title= UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 |publisher= UNESCO Publishing |year=2015 |isbn= 978-92-3-100129-1 |location= Paris |page=269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All EU members contribute to the budget for each seven-year framework programme for research and innovation, the most recent of these being [[Horizon 2020]], adopted in 2014. British researchers receive EU funding through programmes like Horizon 2020. Access to this money will now be renegotiated with the EU with the UK government committing to make up any shortfall to UK institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding-beyond-date-uk-leaves-the-eu |title= Chancellor Philip Hammond guarantees EU funding beyond date UK leaves the EU|last=HM Treasury |first= |date=13 August 2016 |work= UK Government |access-date=|archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once it is no longer a member state, the UK will not be entitled to EU structural funds, which are increasingly being used to finance research-related infrastructure. Over the period of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development (2007–2013), the UK received €8.8 billion from the EU, according to a report by the Royal Society citing European Commission data, and Britain contributed €5.4 billion to this programme. In terms of funding awarded on a competitive basis, the UK was the second-largest recipient of the Seventh Framework Programme after Germany, securing €6.9 billion out of a total of €55.4 billion between 2007 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ec.europa.eu/research/evaluations/index_en.cfm?pg=fp7|title=Seventh FP7 Monitoring Report 2013|last=|first=|publisher=European Commission|year=2015|isbn=|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu|title=Cohesion Policy Data|last=|first=|publisher=European Commission|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/eu-uk-funding/uk-membership-of-eu.pdf|title=UK research and the European Union: the role of the EU in funding UK research|last=|first=|publisher=Royal Society|year=2016|isbn=|location=London|pages=Figure 4, p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grants by the European Research Council, 2013.svg|thumb|Grants by the European Research Council in 2013. Source: ''UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030'', Figure 9.7. Data taken from ERC's ''Annual Report on the ERC Activities and Achievements'', 2014. |330x330px]]
British universities receive a disproportionate share of EU-awarded research grants.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cressey|first=Daniel|year=2016|title=Academics across Europe join 'Brexit' debate|url=http://www.nature.com/news/academics-across-europe-join-brexit-debate-1.19282|journal=Nature|volume=530 |issue=7588|pages=15|doi=10.1038/530015a |pmid=26842034|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 2013, the UK received more competitive research grants (close to 1000) from the European Research Council (ERC) than any other EU country; 44% of these grants went to non-nationals based in the UK, the largest number of any EU country. Germany obtained just over 600 ERC grants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Report on the ERC Activities and Achievements, 2013|last=European Research Council|first=|publisher=Publications Office of the European Union|year=2014|isbn=|location=Luxembourg|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has raised questions about how such funding would be affected by a Brexit.

On average, British universities relied on the EU for around 11% of their research income in 2014–2015. Two-thirds (66%) came from government sources, 4% from British businesses, 13% from British charities and 5% from sources beyond the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2016/university-funding-explained.pdf|title=University Funding Explained|last=|first=|publisher=UK Universities|year=July 2016|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU share can be much higher for the top research universities. For instance, in 2013, the [[University of Manchester]] successfully applied for £23 million from the [[European Regional Development Fund]] to create a [[National Graphene Institute]]. The UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Unit provided a further £38 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.graphene.manchester.ac.uk/collaborate/national-graphene-institute/funding/|title=The Home of Graphene: Investment in Graphene|last=National Graphene Institute|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=9694|title=Huge Funding Boost for Graphene Institute|last=|first=|date=13 March 2013|work=University of Manchester press release|access-date=13 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Manchester is participating in the two flagship projects selected for €1 billion in funding under Horizon 2020's Future and Emerging Technologies programme, namely the graphene project and the human brain project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=9427|title=Manchester Leads the Way in 1 bn euro Research Projects|last=|first=|date=28 January 2013|work=University of Manchester press release.|access-date=13 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chancellor of the [[University of Oxford]], Chris Patten, said in July 2016 that the university received about 40% of its research income from government and that its 'research income will of course fall significantly after we have left the EU unless a Brexit government guarantees to cover the shortfall'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On 13 August 2016, Chancellor Philip Hammond promised that British businesses and universities would have certainty over future funding and advised them to continue bidding for competitive EU funds while the UK remained a member of the EU. He said that all structural and investment fund projects, including agri-environment schemes, signed before the Autumn Statement would be fully funded and that the UK would underwrite the payments for research project funding awarded by the EU to universities participating in Horizon 2020, even when specific projects continued beyond the UK’s departure from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-philip-hammond-guarantees-eu-funding-beyond-date-uk-leaves-the-eu|title=Chancellor Philip Hammond guarantees EU funding beyond date UK leaves the EU|last=HM Treasury|first=|date=13 August 2016|work=UK Government|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May announced an increase in government investment in research and development worth £2 billion a year by 2020 and a new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund to back priority technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/cbi-annual-conference-2016-prime-ministers-speech|title=Transcript of speech delivered by Prime Minister Theresa May at CBI annual conference setting out her vision for UK business including a modern Industrial Strategy.|last=May|first=Theresa|date=21 November 2016|website=UK Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2017, the Business Secretary announced a £229 million investment in research and development within the government's new industrial strategy, which is being developed in consultation with stakeholder groups. Of this investment, £126 million is to go towards the creation of 'the world-class' [[National Graphene Institute]] at the [[University of Manchester]], [[graphene]] having been first isolated at this university in 2004, and £103 million to create a new centre of excellence for life and physical sciences at the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford, which will foster ties between academia and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/229-million-of-industrial-strategy-investment-in-science-research-and-innovation|title=£229 million of industrial strategy investment in science, research and innovation|last=Clark|first=Greg|date=23 February 2017|work=Press release|access-date=7 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=UK Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2017, the Prime Minister’s office and the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy issued a statement announcing an extra £2.3 billion of public money for research and development in 2021/2022, which would raise government expenditure that year to £12.5 billion. The government is planning to work with industry to increase private investment, with the aim of seeing total research spending increase by as much as £80 billion by 2027, to the equivalent of 2.4% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/government-uk-rd-spending/|title=Government announces boost to UK R&amp;D spending|last=|first=|date=20 November 2017|website=The Engineer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, the UK had raised its research effort to 1.69% of GDP, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]].

===National Health Service===
The Brexit Health Alliance was established in June 2017 with [[Hugh Taylor (civil servant)|Sir Hugh Taylor]] as chair ‘to safeguard’ the interests of the health service. The 14 participating organisations cover the whole of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New healthcare alliance forms to ‘safeguard’ NHS in Brexit talks|url=http://healthcareleadernews.com/article/new-healthcare-alliance-forms-‘safeguard’-nhs-brexit-talks|accessdate=14 July 2017|publisher=Health Care Leader|date=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Health Service is 'facing the worst nursing crisis for the last 20 years', with official figures published in June 2017 showing a 96% drop in less than in a year in the number of nurses from the European Union registering to practice in the UK: 46 European nurses arrived to work in Britain in April 2017, compared with 1,304 in the month after the Brexit referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/12/number-eu-nurses-coming-uk-falls-96-per-cent-since-brexit-vote/|title=Number of EU nurses coming to UK falls 96 per cent since Brexit vote|last=Donnelly|first=Laura|date=12 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2018, 62,000 National Health Service (NHS) staff in England were non-British EU nationals, equivalent to 5.6% of all NHS staff. This compares with 12.5% for non-British NHS staff overall, including staff from Asia and Africa. Non-British EU nationals made up almost 10% of doctors in England's hospital and community health services, just over 7% of all nurses and 5% of scientific, therapeutic and technical staff. More than one in three (36%) hospital doctors earned their main medical qualification beyond the UK: 20% in Asia and 9% in the EU. Some 4% of general practitioners qualified in the EU and 13% in Asia.[https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7783#fullreport]

===British participation in European institutions===
According to a 2017 study by European law firm Fieldfisher, the UK contributes £620 million annually to 67 European institutions. The study observed that 'following Brexit, it is likely that much of the budget will need to be redirected to support functions inside the UK.'  The biggest savings will come from the UK no longer having to contribute £470 million towards the running costs of 21 bodies that include the European Parliament, the EU's diplomatic service (the European External Acton Service), the European Council, the European Court of Justice and the European Anti-fraud Office. Fieldfisher's Regulatory Group estimates that the British government 'will need to contribute around £35 million annually to part-fund several EU agencies with which the UK will need to maintain a strategic partnership' post-Brexit, The remainder (£114 million annually) will need to be invested in the UK counterparts or in new purpose-built UK government agencies, to maintain essential functions formerly carried out on the UK's behalf by the EU agencies.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fieldfisher.com/media/2017/12/eu-institutions-post-brexit-as-the-uk-government-stands-to-take-control-of-470-million#sthash.zFqwQuyS.dpbs|title=EU institutions post-Brexit as the UK Government stands to take control of £470 million annually|last=|first=|date=2 December 2017|work=Fieldfisher|access-date=3 December 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different EU countries host specialized European agencies. These agencies may be responsible for enforcing particular regulatory regimes, or for pooling knowledge and sharing information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/589189/The_United_Kingdoms_exit_from_and_partnership_with_the_EU_Print.pdf|title=The United Kingdom's Exit from and New Relationship with the European Union|last=White Paper|first=|publisher=Her Majesty's Government|year=2017|isbn=|series=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the [[European Medicines Agency]] based in the UK, the [[European Chemicals Agency]] based in Finland, the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] based in Germany, the [[European Space Agency]] based in France and the [[European Food Safety Authority]] based in Italy. There are also three [[European Supervisory Authorities]] which are responsible for oversight in the field of financial services. One of the three is based in London, the [[European Banking Authority]]. 

In its Brexit white paper of February 2017, the British government stated that, 'as part of exit negotiations, the government will discuss with the EU and Member States our future status and arrangements with regard to these agencies'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;According to a white paper published by the Department for Exiting the EU in 2017 and cited by the Fieldfisher study, the UK will need to maintain a strategic partnership with some EU agencies. This includes those agencies 'which regulate aviation safety, maintain electricity transfer arrangements and deal with energy regulation, data protection, defence policy, policing and approaches to security and environmental policy'.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  A third country (that is, a non-EU member state) may participate in certain EU agencies by concluding an international agreement with the EU. These agreements cover issues such as the third country's budgetary contribution and staffing arrangements. In a blog post in July 2016, Merijn Chamon of the Ghent European Law Institute wrote that 'this option would allow the UK to pick and choose but the procedure is very cumbersome, which is also why today very few such agreements with third states have been concluded. For the UK, these agreements could, in theory, be incorporated in the Article 50 agreement, but it is doubtful whether that agreement is the appropriate instrument for such detailed arrangements'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7957/CBP-7957.pdf|title=EU Agencies and post-Brexit Options|last=Miller|first=Vaughne|publisher=House of Commons Library Briefing Paper Number 7957,|date=28 April 2017|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her Mansion House speech on 2 March 2018, the Prime Minister stated that &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;we will also want to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could remain part of EU agencies such as those that are critical for the chemicals, medicines and aerospace industries: the [[European Medicines Agency]], the [[European Chemicals Agency]], and the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]]'. She went on to say that 'we would, of course, accept that this would mean abiding by the rules of those agencies and making an appropriate financial contribution. I want to explain what I believe the benefits of this approach could be, both for us and the EU. First, associate membership of these agencies is the only way to meet our objective of ensuring that these products only need to undergo one series of approvals, in one country. Second, these agencies have a critical role in setting and enforcing relevant rules. And if we were able to negotiate associate membership, we would be able to ensure that we could continue to provide our technical expertise. Third, associate membership could permit UK firms to resolve certain challenges related to the agencies through UK courts rather than the European Court of Justice'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-our-future-economic-partnership-with-the-european-union|title=PM speech on our future economic partnership with the European Union|last=May|first=Theresa|date=|website=Prime Minister's Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the UK leaves the EU Single Market and Customs Union, which was its stated intention as of March 2018, it may not be possible for the UK to obtain associate membership of the EU. In its draft negotiating guidelines published on 7 March 2018, the Council of the European Union stated that 'the Union will preserve its autonomy as regards its decision-making, which excludes participation of the United Kingdom as a third-country to (sic) EU Institutions, agencies or bodies'.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

==== European Court of Justice ====
The government has said it plans to leave the [[European Court of Justice]]. Prime Minister Theresa May stated unequivocally at the Conservative Party Conference in October 2016 that 'we are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the [[European Court of Justice]]. That’s not going to happen'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.conservatives.com/|title=Prime Minister: the Good that Government can do|last=May|first=Theresa|date=5 October 2016|website=British Conservative Party|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister also pledged to curb free movement and indicated that she would seek single market access. These goals are, however, incompatible with EU statements that both free movement and ECJ adjudication are non-negotiable prerequisites for single market access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iqvia.com/-/media/iqvia/pdfs/nemea/uk/finding_a_cure_brexit.pdf| first=Luke| last=Tryl| title=Finding a cure: getting the best Brexit deal for Britain’s life sciences| publisher=Public Policy Projects| date=2 November 2016| access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Patent Court====
EU companies currently need to file for patent protection in all 28 member states. The unitary patent package adopted by 25 EU members in 2013 (by all but Croatia, Italy and Spain) is expected to slash procedural fees and translation costs by 85%. The unitary patent package will only apply, however, once the Agreement on a [[Unified Patent Court]] enters into force.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For that to happen, 13 countries must ratify it, including  France, Germany and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epo.org/law-practice/unitary.html|title=Unitary Patent &amp; Unified Patent Court|first=European Patent|last=Office|publisher=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 2018, 16 countries had ratified the agreement, including France  on 14 March 2014 and the UK on 26 April 2018 - but not Germany, meaning that the court has not yet entered into force. In announcing ratification of the Unified Patent Court, the British Minister of Intellectual Property, Sam Gyimah, stated that 'the unique nature of the proposed court means that the UK’s future relationship with the Unified Patent Court will be subject to negotiation with European partners as we leave the EU'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-ratifies-the-unified-patent-court-agreement|title=UK ratified the unified patent court agreement|last=Gyimah|first=Sam|date=11 June 2018|work=Intellectual Property Office of the British government|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{which|date=April 2017}} British ministers have expressed concern at the potential loss of innovation and business interest in the UK, if Britain isn't part of the Unified Patent Court after it leaves the EU. Normally, members of the new patent court must be both EU members and members of the European Court of Justice. Even if the European Commission could be persuaded to ignore the requirement for EU membership, the UK would have to remain a member of the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ). This is not because the patent court would be a conduit for EU law into Britain but because the patent court would occasionally have to refer to the ECJ on matters of European law when assessing patent cases, in order to know which definition to adopt.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

British judges were heavily involved in developing the procedures for the Unified Patent Court.  When it was decided that the Unified Patent Court would be split into three locations, Prime Minister David Cameron 'succeeded in making sure that one of them – which will rule on pharmaceuticals and life sciences – was in London'. The UK has developed a reputation as a key hub in this area, an argument which helped it to win the bid to host the [[European Medicines Agency]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2017/02/28/patent-law-theresa-may-s-new-brexit-battlefield|title=Patent law: Theresa May's new Brexit battlefield|last=Dunt|first=Ian|date=28 February 2017|website=Blog available at Politics.Co.Uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Medicines Agency ====
The [[European Medicines Agency]], which licenses new drugs, is based in London. The Secretary of Health, Jeremy Hunt, has stated that the UK will leave this agency because it is subject to the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Nineteen EU countries have offered to host the Agency. On 20 November 2017, the city of Amsterdam in the Netherlands was chosen after several rounds of voting.  The agency must move to Amsterdam and take up its operations there by 30 March 2019 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2017/11/news_detail_002857.jsp&amp;mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1|title=EMA to relocate to Amsterdam, the Netherlands|last=|first=|date=20 November 2017|website=European Medicines Agency|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, the European Medicines Agency decided to exclude the UK from all current and future contracts for the assessment of new drugs. This authorisation process is compulsory for all drugs sold in Europe. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency accounted for an estimated 20-30% of all drug assessments in the EU in 2018, earning the MHRA about £14 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/02/britain-loses-medicines-contracts-as-eu-body-anticipates-brexit|title=Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|date=2 September 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=4 September 2018|last2=Devlin|first2=Hannah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Chemicals Agency ====
The [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) is based in Helsinki, Finland. It owns and maintains the world’s most comprehensive database on chemicals. The EU's [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation]] requires industry to register information on the safety of substances they use in ECHA's central database.  By 2018, 13 620 European companies had registered nearly 90 000 chemicals with ECHA that had been manufactured in, or imported into, the EU and [[European Economic Area]]. When several companies produce the same chemical, the registration with ECHA is shared between them [https://echa.europa.eu]

Were the UK to leave the agency, it would be difficult to determine who owns the data that British companies have submitted to ECHA up to now.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/12-brexit-cherries-the-uk-wants-to-pick/|title=12 brexit cherries the UK wants to pick|last=Randerson|first=James|date=11 June 2018|work=Politico Europe|access-date=11 June 2018|last2=Hervey|first2=Ginger}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her Mansion House speech in March 2018, the Prime Minister suggested that the UK could retain associate membership of ECHA once it becomes a third country but, as of mid-2018, it was not clear whether such a proposal would be acceptable to the EU. Even if the UK remains in the agency, British producers of chemicals will only be able to access the EU market post-Brexit if they comply with  REACH. Since the EU is constantly updating its lists of banned and restricted chemicals, the British and EU regimes will diverge unless the UK regularly copies ECHA’s decisions on individual chemicals. Regulatory divergence would oblige UK producers wishing to export chemicals to the EU to comply with two sets of rules, adding red tape and pushing up costs.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

==== European Aviation Safety Agency ====
The [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) is based in Cologne, Germany. In 2017, the government was reportedly exploring the possibility of becoming an associate member of EASA to ensure that international flights out of the UK are not adversely affected by Brexit. Article 66 of EASA regulations establishes a legal route for a third country to participate in this agency. Were the UK to become an associate member of EASA, it would continue to make a financial contribution to the body but would lose its voting rights. In the case of a domestic dispute over the application of safety regulations, UK courts would have jurisdiction but, according to Article 50 of the same EASA rules, the European Court of Justice would be the ultimate arbitre of EASA rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/govt-to-stay-in-eu-air-safety-body-in-blurring-of-brexit-red-line-11151049|title=Govt to stay in EU air safety body in blurring of Brexit red line|last=Islam|first=Faisal|date=1 December 2017|work=Sky News|access-date=5 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== European Defence Agency ====
All EU members (except Denmark) are part of the [[European Defence Agency]], which is based in Brussels. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted in November 2017 that 'the UK will no longer be a member of the European Defence Agency or Europol. The UK will no longer be involved in decision-making, nor in planning our defence and security instruments'.[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2017/jul/20/where-are-we-up-to-in-these-brexit-talks] 

In December 2017, the UK was one of 25 EU countries which signed up to the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the EU's new defence pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/new-eu-defense-pact-whos-doing-what/|title=New defense pact: who's doing what|last=Barigazzi|first=Jacopo|date=14 December 2017|work=Politico.eu|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the UK was one of nine EU countries which launched an autonomous  European Intervention Initiative, along with Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The force will be able to deploy troops near Europe's borders in the event of a crisis. EU defence ministers also agreed in June 2018 to fix conditions for third country participation in PESCO projects that would also apply to the UK once it leaves the bloc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-to-form-part-of-joint-eu-european-defense-force-pesco/|title=Nine EU states, including UK, sign off on joint military intervention force|last=Salam|first=Yasmine|date=25 June 2018|work=Politico.eu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the European Commission announced that it was developing a collaborative research programme in innovative defence products and technologies at EU level that would become operational on 1 January 2021 when the EU's next seven-year framework programme for research gets under way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/launching_the_european_defence_fund.pdf|title=Launching the European Defence Fund|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|work=European Commission|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the  European Commission proposed endowing the European Defence Fund with €13 billion over the period 2021-2027 to enable cross-border investments in the latest interoperable technology and equipment in areas such as encrypted software and drone technology. Of this, €4.1 billion will finance competitive and collaborative research projects, mainly through grants, involving at least three participants from three EU member states. Beyond the research component, €8.9 billion will be available to co-finance with member states the cost of prototype development and the ensuing certification and testing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4121_en.htm|title=EU budget: stepping up the EU's role as a security and defence provider|last=|first=|date=13 June 2018|work=European Commission|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the French press agency AFP cited an EU official as saying that 'currently, 80% of research and development in the European Union is done on a national basis. The result is 173 weapons systems that are not interoperable. We cannot let things go on like this.’ Another EU official was cited as saying that 'countries that are not members of the EU and the European Economic Area will not be associated to the European Defence Fund unless a specific agreement is concluded to that aim. The programme is designed to apply as of 1 January 2021 and therefore for a Union of 27 Member States.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/defence-notes/eu-set-shut-uk-us-out-defence-fund-officials/|title=EU set to shut UK and US out of defence fund|last=|first=|date=12 June 2018|work=Agence France Presse|access-date=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Euratom ====
The government stated in its Brexit white paper of February 2017 that invoking Article 50 to leave the EU would involve leaving the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) as well. Although Euratom is an independent body, it is governed by EU bodies such as the [[European Commission]], the [[European Council of Ministers]] and [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Euratom’s flagship project is the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER). The ITER project involves a consortium made up of China, the EU, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States. The project is building an experimental reactor in France that will be powered by nuclear fusion, a technology which produces few pollutants.

The EU is financing its 45% share of the ITER construction costs (€2.7 billion over the 2014–2020 period ) through the EU budget's Multiannual Financial Framework. 'During the forthcoming negotiations, the European Commission is expected to claim the UK’s share of this amount as a liability towards the EU'.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Between 2014 and 2018, Euratom has a total research budget of €1.6 billion under the Horizon 2020 budget, of which about €728 million has been set aside for research on nuclear fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=247, Table 9.8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, €424 million has been earmarked for EUROfusion, a consortium of universities and national laboratories, primarily for ITER-related research. A further €283 million will go to the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the UK's national laboratory for fusion research.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccfe.ac.uk/JET.aspx|title=JET|last=|first=|date=|website=Culham Centre for Fusion Energy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Culham Centre hosts the world's largest magnetic fusion experiment, Joint European Torus (JET), on behalf of its European partners. The JET facilities are used by about 350 European fusion scientists each year.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; JET has an annual budget of about €69 million. Of this, 87.5% is provided by the European Commission and the remainder by the UK's  [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] within the [[Euratom Treaty]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2017/02/brexit-goes-nuclear-the-consequences-of-leaving-euratom/|title=Brexit goes nuclear: The consequences of leaving Euratom|last=Nano|first=Enrico|last2=Tagliapietra|first2=Simone|date=21 February 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is not the only focus of Euratom. As stated in the government's Brexit white paper, 'the [[Euratom Treaty]] provides the legal framework for civil nuclear power generation and radioactive waste management for members of the Euratom Community, all of whom are EU Member States. This includes arrangements for nuclear safeguards, safety and the movement and trade of nuclear materials both between Euratom Members such as France and the UK, as well as between Euratom Members and third countries such as the USA'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2016, about 21% of the UK's electricity came from nuclear power. The UK ranks second in the EU after France for the number of operational nuclear reactors (15).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In its white paper, the government confirmed that ' the nuclear industry remains of key strategic importance to the UK and leaving Euratom does not affect our clear aim of seeking to maintain close and effective arrangements for civil nuclear cooperation, safeguards, safety and trade with Europe and our international partners. Furthermore, the UK is a world leader in nuclear research and development and there is no intention to reduce our ambition in this important area'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the government's letter of 29 March 2017 notifying the European Council of the UK’s intention to withdraw from the EU, Prime Minister Theresa May also announced ‘the UK’s intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community’.

In its Cooperation on Science and Innovation paper on the UK's future partnership with the EU, the Department for Exiting the EU states that 'the UK hopes to find a way to continue working with the EU on nuclear R&amp;D, including the Joint European Torus (JET) and International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (TER) programmes'.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== European Space Agency ====
The European Space Agency (ESA) has 22 member states and is independent of the EU, even if programmes tend to benefit from EU funding. The Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, for instance, is 70% EU funded. This has raised concerns in the UK space sector as to whether British companies will be entitled to submit tenders for lucrative ESA contracts post-Brexit. The UK is aiming for its space sector to raise its global market share from 6.6% to 10% by 2030. Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage built Sentinel 5P, an air pollution monitoring satellite that was launched in the UK in October 2017 as part of the Copernicus programme. Sentinel 5P is part of a 45.5 million euro contract signed with ESA in 2011.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The UK government stated in its future partnership paper on Collaboration on Science and Innovation that it wishes to remain fully involved in Copernicus, [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] and the [[Space Surveillance and Tracking System|Space Surveillance and Tracking]] programme post-Brexit.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/642542/Science_and_innovation_paper.pdf|title=Collaboration on Science and Innovation: a Future Partnership Paper|last=|first=|publisher=Department for Exiting the European Union|year=2017|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third countries may participate in ESA programmes but current arrangements tend to cover data access and usage, rather than eligibility to apply for large industrial contracts.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spacenews.com/uk-hopes-to-stay-involved-in-copernicus-post-brexit/|title=UK hopes to stay involved in Copernicus post Brexit|last=Pultarova|first=Tereza|date=16 October 2017|work=Space News|access-date=3 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, a majority of EU member states sided with the European Commission in rejecting British demands to remain a full partner in the development of the Galileo satellite once the UK becomes a third country. This means that British companies will be unable to bid for the new round of contracts being issued by the EU. The British Minister of Universities and Science, Sam Gyimah, reacted to the decision by saying that Britain was willing to 'walk away' from the project and develop a rival satellite. The UK is demanding that the EU return the £1 billion invested thus far by the UK in Galileo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/13/eu-member-states-block-uks-access-to-galileo-satellite-programme-after-brexit|title=Security row over EU Galileo satellite project as Britain is shut out|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|date=14 June 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Galileo Security Monitoring Centre ====
In January 2018, the European Commission announced that the back-up security monitoring centre for [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], Europe's version of the [[Global Positioning System]], would be relocated from Britain to Spain as part of the Brexit process. The centre was originally awarded to London in 2010 following a competitive bidding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-galileo-satellite-space-industry-move-from-london-to-spain-madrid-uk-a8165841.html|title=Brexit: EU relocates Galileo satellite system installation from UK to Spain|last=Stone|first=Jon|date=17 January 2018|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CERN ====
The [[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research]] &lt;!--The official English name has a 'z' in it. Since it's a proper noun in this context, please don't change the spelling.--&gt; (CERN) is an independent [[intergovernmental organisation]], subject to its own treaty. The UK’s membership of CERN is therefore unaffected by Brexit. Several of CERN’s member and associate member states are not EU members, and the organisation is headquartered outside the EU, in Switzerland. British citizens will retain the right to be employed by CERN, and British businesses will remain eligible to bid for CERN contracts.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

CERN’s core research programme is funded by its member states, but CERN also receives EU grants through the bloc's multi-year framework programmes, including Horizon 2020. CERN member states that neither belong to the EU, nor have special arrangements with the bloc, can participate in CERN-EU research projects but are not entitled to EU funding. British nationals will be entitled to apply for the EU’s [[Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions|Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowships]] as long as CERN receives funding from this scheme.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gianotti|first=Fabiola|date=28 July 2016|title=Statement about UK referendum on the EU|url=https://cds.cern.ch/journal/CERNBulletin/2016/26/Official%20News/2194535?ln=en|journal=CERN Bulletin|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public comment up to August 2018==
===Concerns over future mobility and international scientific collaboration===
Scientists in favour of staying in the EU have noted that membership allows researchers to move freely between member states and to work with no restrictions. Immediately after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|UK general election 2015]], pro-remain scientists founded the grassroots campaign [[Scientists for EU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Who we are | url = http://www.scientistsforeu.uk/who_we_are | website = scientistsforeu.uk | publisher = Scientists for EU | access-date = 12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT_091216"&gt;{{cite news | last = Chaffin | first = Joshua | title = Britain's Europhiles splinter into dozens of grassroots movements | url = https://www.ft.com/content/b196cec0-bc6f-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080 | work = [[Financial Times]] | subscription = yes | quote = ''...Scientists for the EU has emerged as a social media champion...

Freedom of movement for talent and ambitious EU science funding programmes, which support vital, complex international collaborations, put the UK in a world-leading position'. A ''Nature'' poll in March 2016 found that 83% of UK scientists were in favour of remaining in the EU.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cressey|first=Daniel|year=2016|title=Scientists say 'no' to UK exit from Europe in Nature poll|url=http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-say-no-to-uk-exit-from-europe-in-nature-poll-1.19636|journal=Nature|volume=531 |issue= 7596|page=559|doi=10.1038/531559a |pmid=27029257|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum]], hundreds of scientists contacted Scientists for EU voicing concerns about the future of scientific research in the UK after [[Brexit]], many saying they planned to leave the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/brain-drain-has-begun-and-its-costing-millions-academics-warn-fg2tt3s2p| work=[[The Times]]| title=Brain drain has begun . . . and it’s costing millions, academics warn| first=Nicola| last=Woolcock| date=15 October 2016| access-date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indy20180712"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/brexit-britain-latest-news-academics-threaten-to-quit-brain-drain-over-racist-xenophobic-eu-a7133316.html|title=Racist, xenophobic and anti-intellectual: Academics threaten to leave Brexit Britain|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Ian|last=Johnston|date=12 July 2016|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/16/science-research-hit-by-brexit|first=Will|last=Hutton|title=Why Brexit may be a deadly experiment for science|date=16 July 2016|access-date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT20160809"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.ft.com/content/ba85f924-5e24-11e6-a72a-bd4bf1198c63| work=[[The Financial Times]]| title=Brexit Briefing: Scientists feel the effect| first=Clive| last=Cookson| date=9 August 2016| access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gross2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Michael|title=Angry voters may turn back the clocks|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=15|year=2016|pages=R689–R692|issn=09609822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.07.056}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Commenting in 2016, [[Kurt Deketelaere]], secretary-general of the [[League of European Research Universities]] in Leuven, Belgium, whose purpose is to influence policy in Europe and to develop best practice through mutual exchange of experience, said that the potential loss of mobility and collaboration was worrying for scientists across Europe, as scientists wished 'to work with the best in their field'. However, for [[Angus Dalgleish]], a cancer and HIV researcher at St George’s, University of London, who once stood for election as a member of the pro-Brexit UK Independence Party, universities already maintained successful collaborations with non-EU members, so opting out would have 'no negative impact on scientific collaboration whatsoever'.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On 18 November 2016, the House of Commons [[Science and Technology Committee]] published a report in which it recommended that the [[Department for Exiting the European Union]] appoint a departmental Chief Scientific Adviser to 'help ensure that the impact on science and research of various models for Brexit, and the opportunities these provide, is understood and prioritised within the Department'. The Committee also recommended raising the UK's commitment to research to 3% of GDP, the target fixed by the European Union in the [[Lisbon Strategy]] in 2000 and reiterated in ''[[Europe 2020]]'', 'to demonstrate a determination not only to negotiating [sic] a post-Brexit relationship with the EU that is good for science but also to secure opportunities for science collaboration with markets beyond Europe'.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmsctech/502/502.pdf|title=Leaving the EU: implications and opportunities for science and research|last=House of Commons Science and Technology Committee|first=|date=18 November 2016|work=|access-date=6 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release of 18 November 2016, Scientists for the EU welcomed the report's recommendations but regretted that it portrayed research collaborations beyond the EU as an opportunity of Brexit. 'EU membership has never restricted UK science collaborations outside the EU', the press release stated. 'Rather, EU membership has enhanced UK global outreach via its world-leading programme'. Commenting on the press release, Martin Yuille, Co-Director of the Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research in Manchester, said that 'Brexit will not enhance opportunities for collaboration beyond the EU because, as an EU Member State, we already benefit from the global collaboration framework developed over the decades by the EU. The EU has Science and Technology Agreements with 20 countries (including the major economies) and is preparing similar agreements with further countries and regional groupings (e.g. the whole of Africa and the Pacific Rim). The EU is developing a permanent structure of scientific and technological collaboration with 180 countries. All that will need to be replaced by a UK outside the EU'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scientistsforeu.uk/2016/11/press-release-science-technology-committee-demands-government/|title=Scientists for EU respond to House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report: ''Leaving the EU: implications and opportunities for science and research''|last=Press release|first=|date=18 November 2016|website=Scientists for the EU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its March 2018 report on [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/705/705.pdf Brexit, Science and Innovation], the House of Commons' Select Committee on Science and Technology recommended that the Government ask the Migration Advisory Committee to integrate its conclusions regarding the immigration arrangements needed to support science and innovation into a broader agreement with the EU on science and innovation 'by October 2018 ... if a pact is not agreed in late 2018, this will increase risks to retaining and attracting the essential talent that our science and innovation sectors need.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

===Concerns over future funding of research===
A July 2016 investigation by ''The Guardian'' suggested that some UK researchers were being discriminated against in funding and research projects after the referendum result. The newspaper reported that European partners were reluctant to employ British researchers due to uncertainties over funding. It cited a confidential survey of the UK's Russell Group universities, a group of 24 institutions renowned for research and academic excellence; in one case, 'an EU project officer recommended that a lead investigator drop all UK partners from a consortium because Britain's share of funding could not be guaranteed'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jul/12/uk-scientists-dropped-from-eu-projects-because-of-post-brexit-funding-fears|title=UK scientists dropped from EU projects because of post-Brexit funding fears|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=12 July 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncertainty over future funding for projects stands to harm research in other ways, the same  survey suggests. A number of institutions that responded said some researchers were reluctant to carry on with bids for EU funds because of the financial unknowns, while others did not want to be the weak link in a consortium. One university said it had serious concerns about its ability to recruit research fellows for current projects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In February 2017, the ComUE (Consortium of universities and establishments) of the University of Paris Seine issued an invitation to British universities to apply for space on site post-Brexit. The idea for a Paris Seine International Campus on the outskirts of Paris dates back to 2013 but, in light of the UK's impending departure from the EU, ComUE decided to reserve facilities and services for British universities to enable them to develop high-level research and teaching activities on site.  [[Jean-Michel Blanquer]], dean and president of [[ESSEC Business School]], a member of ComUE, told the ''[[Times Higher Education|Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' that 'it would be a “win-win” situation for UK universities concerned about losing European funding opportunities and international students'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/brexit-uk-universities-invited-to-set-up-in-france|title=Brexit: UK universities invited to set up in France|last=Elmes|first=John|date=16 February 2017|work=Times Higher Education Supplement|access-date=4 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a notice posted on the research section of the [[European Commission]] on 6 October 2017, UK researchers were informed that if the UK does not agree on a new science cooperation arrangement with Brussels after it leaves the EU in March 2019, they will not receive any more EU funding or will have to leave existing projects. The statement regarding [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development#Horizon 2020|Horizon 2020]] funding said, "If the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU during the grant period without concluding an agreement with the EU ensuring in particular that British applicants continue to be eligible, you will cease to be eligible to receive EU funding (while continuing, where possible, to participate) or be required to leave the project on the basis of Article 50 of the grant agreement."&lt;ref name="EC_H2020"&gt;{{cite web | title = Participant Portal H2020 Online Manual | url = http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/grants/applying-for-funding/find-partners_en.htm | website = ec.europa.eu | publisher = [[European Commission]] | date = 6 October 2017 | access-date = 12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its March 2018 report on [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/705/705.pdf Brexit, Science and Innovation], the House of Commons' Select Committee on Science and Technology recalled that the UK needed to commit by October 2018 to contributing to the EU's next [https://ec.europa.eu/info/node/71880 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021-2027)], or risk compromising its role as a 'science superpower'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/mar/21/uks-status-as-science-superpower-at-risk-after-brexit-warn-mps|title=UK's status as science superpower at risk after Brexit, say MPs|last=O'Carroll|first=Lisa|date=21 March 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=22 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report stated that 'we are concerned that the Government’s default position does not appear to be that the UK will participate in Framework Programme 9. While the details of the Programme have not yet been agreed, the Government should state clearly that it intends to participate ... Specifically, the Government should state clearly in its response to this report that it intends to secure Associated Country status for Framework Programme 9'.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/705/705.pdf|title=Brexit, Science and Innovation|last=House of Commons' Select Committee on Science and Technology|first=|publisher=British Parliament|year=2018|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2018, the newly appointed Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, suggested that the UK might not honour the withdrawal agreement that guarantees continued funding of EU programmes until the end of Horizon 2020 in December 2020 through a transitional arrangement. According to a technical note published by the government in August outlining the likely consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the UK's participation in Horizon 2020, UK institutions would no longer be eligible for three Horizon 2020 funding lines after 29 March 2019: European Research Council (ERC) grants, Marie Skłodowska-Curie actions (MSCA), and SME instrument (SMEi) grants for small innovative businesses under a no-deal Brexit scenario&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/horizon-2020-funding-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/horizon-2020-funding-if-theres-no-brexit-deal--2|title=Guidance on Horizon 2020 Funding if there's no Brexit Deal|last=UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|first=|date=23 August 2018|website=UK Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Mike Galsworthy, co-founder and director of Scientists for EU, described this document as 'a huge blow'. He commented that 'these three lines represent 45% of the UK’s receipts to date from Horizon 2020. If the UK is currently winning €1.283 billion each year from Horizon 2020, then a no-deal Brexit will cost UK research €577.35 million (£520.7 million) a year in lost opportunity to access these high-value grants. By far the most critical of those funding lines is the ERC. The UK has won €4.73 billon to date from Horizon 2020 overall, with €1.29bn of that in the form of ERC grants, €0.7 billion in the form of MSCA grants and €0.14 billion in SME Instrument grants&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, UK Research and Innovation would take over the funding of projects that currently receive payments from the European Commission. However, Dr Galsworthy observes that this would not allow UK research project coordinators  to pay their partners in EU countries, forcing the UK partner to step aside from any coordinating role. The UK has coordinated more Horizon 2020 research projects than any other EU country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2018/aug/28/a-no-deal-brexit-will-betray-british-science|title=A no-deal Brexit will betray British science|last=Galsworthy|first=Mike|date=29 August 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns over future market access===
{{See also|Economic effects of Brexit}}
After the British referendum in June 2016, Carlos Ghosn, Chief Executive Officer of Japanese vehicle manufacturer Nissan, expressed doubts about the company's future in the UK if the country left the single market. After receiving written assurances from the government, Ghosn confirmed in October 2016 that its Qashqai and X-Trail SUV ranges would be built at its Sunderland plant but added that the firm would want to 're-evaluate the situation' once the final Brexit deal was concluded.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-nissan-letter-no-money-davos-theresa-may-a7538391.html|title=Brexit: Government didn't offer Nissan money to stay in UK|last=Grice|first=Andrew|last2=Watts|first2=Joe|date=20 January 2017|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Business Secretary told the House of Commons on 31 October 2016 that the government had assured Nissan that it would continue its longstanding programme of support for the competitiveness of the automotive sector, work with the automotive sector to ensure that more of the supply chain could locate to the UK and maintain a strong commitment to research and development into ultra-low emission vehicles. He also said that, in its negotiations to leave the EU, the government would ensure that trade between the UK and EU member states was 'free and unencumbered'.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

As a large net contributor to the EU budget, Britain hosts one of the [[Airbus]] plants in Broughton. There is concern that the UK may lose this leverage post-Brexit. Airbus pays UK suppliers about £4 billion per year and employs 15,000 people directly in the UK. About 4,000 of these employees design the wings for Airbus planes at Filton in Bristol. Another 6,000 workers build more than 1,000 wings each year at Broughton in Flintshire for commercial Airbus aircraft. In September 2017, Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the trade organisation for companies in the UK aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, expressed concern that, post-Brexit, 'there could be a long-term erosion of Britain’s competitiveness and that big projects will not be allocated to the UK'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/03/britain-aerospace-sector-could-be-priced-out-after-brexit|title=Britain's aerospace sector could be priced out after Brexit|last=West|first=Karl|date=3 September 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=5 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the UK strikes bilateral agreements with third countries before leaving the EU to replace those agreements established by the EU with these countries, or this area is covered by the Brexit agreement, British airline carriers will not be entitled to fly to third countries after 29 March 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/10/what-no-deal-brexit-scenario-would-mean-for-uk-industries|title=What a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario would mean for key UK industries|last=Boffey|first=Daniel|date=10 January 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential effect of tariff barriers on high-tech trade ====
Once the UK leaves the EU, it will no longer benefit from the [[European Union free trade agreements|EU’s preferential trade agreements]] with more than 60 third countries, including Canada, Israel, Mexico (revised agreement to be finalized by end 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/eu-mexico-trade-agreement/|title=EU-Mexico Trade Agreement|last=|first=|date=18 June 2018|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and Turkey. An EU-Japan agreement is due to be signed in 2018. On 22 May 2018, the European Commission opened negotiations for bilateral free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/australia/|title=EU-Australia trade agreement|last=|first=|date=18 June 2018|website=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-Brexit, the UK will need to negotiate its own free trade deals with all of these countries over a number of years. In the interim period, World Trade Organization (WTO) rules on tariffs will apply to British high-tech trade with EU third countries. The EU trades with 24 countries on the basis of WTO rules, including the United States of America, Brazil and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=c9e46f7f-08b7-4b68-883d-d12e9bf9433b|title=UK trading with the world post-Brexit|last=Burges|first=Salmon|date=8 November 2017|website=Lexology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to ensure continued unfettered access to the EU's [[internal market]], the UK could choose to remain in the [[European Economic Area]] (like Iceland and Norway) or to conclude a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the [[European Single Market|single market]] ([[Switzerland–European Union relations|Swiss model]]) but this would oblige the UK to adhere to the European Union's four fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of movement within the EU. If no deal is concluded with the EU, the UK will have to fall back on WTO trade rules (and related higher tariffs) for its trade with the EU post-Brexit.

==== Potential effect of non-tariff barriers on high-tech trade ====
A March 2017 report by the House of Lords' European Union Committee concluded that non-tariff barriers post-Brexit could pose as much of a barrier as tariffs to trade in goods. It stated that both applying rules of origin and operating to two separate regulatory standards—for the domestic and EU markets—would be costly for UK businesses. The report analysed several high-tech sectors.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201617/ldselect/ldeucom/129/12902.htm|title=Brexit: trade in goods|date=14 March 2017|publisher=House of Lords' European Union Committee|location=London}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30x30px]] This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/ Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Williams, chief operating officer of [[Airbus]]’s commercial planes unit, cautioned in 2016 against erecting barriers to the free movement of people and parts across its European sites (in Broughton, Toulouse and Hamburg), as the British plant is part of an EU value chain. 'We need a situation that is no less favourable than now', he said. 'When I build a set of wings in Broughton and send them to (the Airbus plant in) Toulouse , I don’t need a thousand pages of documents and tariffs'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/12/airbus-rolls-royce-uk-must-secure-beneficial-eu-trade-deal-quickly|title=Airbus and Rolls-Royce say UK must quickly get beneficial EU trade deals|last=Ruddick|first=Graham|date=12 July 2016|work=|access-date=5 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rules of origin =====
Goods imported into a territory that is not part of a customs union must follow ‘rules of origin’, a procedure which determines where a product and its components were made, in order to levy the correct customs duty. The House of Lords' European Union Committee observed in March 2017 that rules of origin would apply to trade post-Brexit, whether the UK concluded a free trade agreement with the EU or traded with the EU under the rules of the World Trade Organization. ‘Applying rules of origin will generate significant additional administration, and therefore costs and delays, to UK businesses’, the committee's report stated.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===== Standards and regulations =====
In his submission to the House of Lords' European Union Committee, Steve Elliott, Chief Executive Officer of the Chemical Industries Association, highlighted the importance of the EU’s Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations for the chemicals industry and expressed the view that the level of UK-EU trade was such that ‘we would need to continue’ to comply with the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals ([[REACH authorisation procedure|REACH]]) Regulation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Chris Hunt, Director General and Company Secretary of the UK Petroleum Industry Association said that, as the European Committee for Standardisation was open to non-EU members, Brexit ‘should make no difference’ to the UK’s membership and influence. Concerning the downstream petroleum sector, Mr Hunt stated that he would be ‘very keen to ensure that we stick with the COMAH Regulations’. Michael Tholen, Director of Upstream Policy, Oil and Gas UK, stated that the EU had ‘no direct remit over the precise activities of oil and gas extraction offshore’ but that the EU did influence the upstream industry through environmental standards and energy market standards.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Through the Whole Vehicle Type Approval system, the EU sets standards for road vehicles which permit cars to travel or be sold across the EU without further inspections. The British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  told the House of Lords' Committee that ‘the validity of existing type approvals issued by the Vehicle Certification Agency once the UK has left the EU’ required ‘urgent legal clarification’.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Mr Paul Everitt, Chief Executive Officer of the Aerospace and Defence Sector Group, told the committee that it is through the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ‘that we gain access to all of our major markets, whether it is the US, China, Japan or elsewhere’. For this reason, continued membership of EASA was ‘our number one ask of the UK Government’.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In the food and beverages sector, Agra Europe observed that, in areas such as food labelling and pesticide residues, ‘any significant divergence from EU standards in these areas could make UK goods illegal on the EU market’.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The House of Lords' European Union Committee heard in March 2017 that, in the pharmaceutical industry, UK standards would need to be recognised as equivalent by the EU as a pre-requisite for ongoing EU trade. Moreover, regulatory harmonisation and conformity to common labelling requirements would increase the production costs for British pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Professor Sir [[Michael Rawlins]], chair of the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA), the UK body that would take over from the [[European Medicines Agency]], told the House of Lords in January 2017 that 'one of the biggest worries' he had about setting up a stand-alone regulator in post-Brexit Britain was that the UK would be 'at the back of the queue' for new drugs. Professor [[Paul Workman]], president of the UK [[Institute of Cancer Research]], expressed similar concerns. Since pharmaceutical companies sought regulatory approval for new drugs in the biggest markets first, he said, these companies would only approach the UK after the European Union, United States of America and Japan. He estimated that this could mean a delay of two years in new drug breakthroughs becoming available to British patients.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/brexit-latest-news-people-die-uk-only-drug-regulator-ema-leave-cancer-specialist-paul-workman-a7573851.html|title=Brexit: People will die because of plans to set up UK-only drug regulator, cancer specialist warns|last=Johnston|first=Ian|date=February 2017|website=The Independent|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Corruption Perception index 2017.svg|thumb|upright=2.35|Corruption Perceptions Index, 2017]]
The '''Corruption Perceptions Index''' ('''CPI''') is an index published annually by [[Transparency International]] since 1995 which ranks countries "by their perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys."&lt;ref name=cpi&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi|work=Transparency International|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=1 December 2011|author=Transparency International|authorlink=Transparency International|year=2011|df=}}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPI generally defines [[corruption]] as "the misuse of public power for private benefit".&lt;ref name=cpilong2&gt;CPI 2010: Long methodological brief, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The CPI currently ranks 176 countries "on a scale from 100 (very clean) to 0 (highly corrupt)". Denmark and New Zealand are perceived as the least corrupt countries in the world, ranking consistently high among international financial transparency, while the most perceived corrupt country in the world is Somalia, ranking at 9 out of 100 since 2017&lt;ref name=cpidetail&gt;{{cite web|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2017|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017 |work=Transparency International|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=14 August 2017|author=Transparency International|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
{{Political corruption sidebar}}
Transparency International commissioned the [[University of Passau]]'s [[:de:Johann Graf Lambsdorff|Johann Graf Lambsdorff]] to produce the CPI.&lt;ref name=2005FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icgg.org/corruption.cpi_2005_faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions: TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI 2005) |accessdate=22 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 CPI takes into account 16 different surveys and assessments from 12 different institutions.&lt;ref name=cpilong1&gt;CPI 2010: Long methodological brief, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The 13 surveys/assessments are either business people opinion surveys or performance assessments from a group of analysts.&lt;ref name=cpilong2/&gt; Early CPIs used public opinion surveys.&lt;ref name=cpilong7/&gt; The institutions are:

* [[Bertelsmann Foundation]] (based in Germany)
* [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] (based in UK)
* [[Freedom House]] (based in US)
* [[Global Insight]] (based in US)
* [[International Institute for Management Development]] (based in Switzerland)
* Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (based in Hong Kong)
* The PRS Group, Inc., (based in US) 
* [[World Economic Forum]]
* [[World Bank]] 
* [[World Justice Project]](based in US)&lt;ref name=cpisources&gt;{{Cite report |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010: Sources of information |url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/55815/891318/CPI2010_sources_EN.pdf |author=Transparency International |year=2010 |publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries need to be evaluated by at least three sources to appear in the CPI.&lt;ref name=cpilong7&gt;CPI 2010: Long methodological brief, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The CPI measures perception of corruption due to the difficulty of measuring absolute levels of corruption.&lt;ref name=cpifaq&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions (FAQs)|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/faqs|work=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=24 August 2011|author=Transparency International|authorlink=Transparency International|year=2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902224108/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/faqs|archive-date=2011-09-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Validity===
A study published in 2002 found a "very strong significant correlation" between the Corruption Perceptions Index and two other proxies for corruption: black market activity and overabundance of regulation.

All three metrics also had a highly significant correlation with real gross domestic product per capita (RGDP/Cap); the Corruption Perceptions Index correlation with RGDP/Cap was the strongest, explaining over three fourths of the variance.&lt;ref name=ivcp&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilhelm  | first = Paul G. | title = International Validation of the Corruption Perceptions Index: Implications for Business Ethics and Entrepreneurship Education  | journal = Journal of Business Ethics  | volume = 35  | issue = 3  | pages = 177–189  | publisher =  Springer Netherlands  | location =  | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1023/A:1013882225402 }}&lt;!--| accessdate = 21 July 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (Note that a lower index on this scale reflects greater corruption, so that countries with higher RGDPs generally had less corruption.)

==Economic implications==
Research papers published in 2007 and 2008 examined the economic consequences of corruption perception, as defined by the CPI.  The researchers found a correlation between a higher CPI and higher long-term economic growth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shao | first1 = J. | last2 = Ivanov | first2 = P. C. | last3 = Podobnik | first3 = B. | last4 = Stanley | first4 = H. E. | title = Quantitative relations between corruption and economic factors | doi = 10.1140/epjb/e2007-00098-2 | journal = The European Physical Journal B | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 157 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0705.0161 |bibcode = 2007EPJB...56..157S }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an increase in [[GDP]] growth of 1.7% for every unit increase in a country's CPI score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Podobnik | first1 = B. | last2 = Shao | first2 = J. | last3 = Njavro | first3 = D. | last4 = Ivanov | first4 = P. C. | last5 = Stanley | first5 = H.

==Criticism and limitations==
Because corruption is willfully hidden, it is impossible to measure directly; instead, [[Proxy (statistics)|proxies]] for corruption are used. Seligson states that corruption is a very "difficult phenomenon to measure", there have been many attempts to solve this problem but they've all come up with limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Seligson, Mitchell A. "The Impact of Corruption on Regime Legitimacy: A Comparative Study of Four Latin American Countries." ''Journal of Politics''(2002): 408-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index has been criticized on the basis of its methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/TransparencyInternationalCorruptionIndex.pdf|title = Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index: Whose Perceptions Are They Anyway?|date = 2005|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to political scientist Dan Hough, three flaws in the Index include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Here’s this year’s (flawed) Corruption Perception Index. Those flaws are useful.|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/01/27/how-do-you-measure-corruption-transparency-international-does-its-best-and-thats-useful/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2016-01-27|access-date = 2016-01-27|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Dan|last = Hough}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corruption is too complex to be captured by a single score. The nature of corruption in rural Kansas will, for instance, be different from that in the city administration of New York, yet the Index measures them in the same way.
* By measuring perceptions of corruption, as opposed to corruption itself, the Index may simply be reinforcing stereotypes and cliches.
* The Index only measures public-sector corruption, leaving out private actors. This for instance means the [[Libor scandal]] or the [[Volkswagen emissions scandal|VW emissions scandal]] are not counted.
Media outlets frequently use the raw numbers as a yardstick for government performance, without clarifying what the numbers mean. The local Transparency International chapter in [[Bangladesh]] disowned the index results after a change in methodology caused the country's scores to increase; media reported it as an "improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Werve, Jonathan|title=TI's Index: Local Chapter Not Having It|url=http://globalintegrity.org/node/266|website=[[Global Integrity]]|date=2008-09-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514053437/http://globalintegrity.org/node/266|archivedate=2013-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 article in ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'', Alex Cobham suggested that CPI should be dropped for the good of Transparency International. It argues that the CPI embeds a powerful and misleading elite bias in popular perceptions of corruption, potentially contributing to a vicious cycle and at the same time incentivizing inappropriate policy responses. Cobham writes, "the index corrupts perceptions to the extent that it's hard to see a justification for its continuing publication."&lt;ref name="Cobham, Alex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrupting Perceptions|author=Cobham, Alex|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/07/22/corrupting_perceptions|journal=[[Foreign Policy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, recent econometric analyses that have exploited the existence of natural experiments on the level of corruption and compared the CPI with other subjective indicators have found that, while not perfect, the CPI does appear to consistently and validly measure the magnitude of corruption across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/113281515516828746/pdf/WPS8299.pdf |title= Can We Measure the Power of the Grabbing Hand? A Comparative Analysis of Different Indicators of Corruption|last=Hamilton|first= Alexander|date=2017|website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, many lawyers advise international businesses to consult the CPI when attempting to measure the risk of [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] violations in different nations. This practice has been criticized by the ''Minnesota Journal of International Law'', which wrote that since the CPI may be subject to perceptual biases it therefore should not be considered by lawyers to be a measure of actual national corruption risk.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Campbell, Stuart Vincent.  [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2210019 "Perception is Not Reality: The FCPA, Brazil, and the Mismeasurement of Corruption"] 22 ''Minnesota Journal of International Law'' 1, p. 247 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparency International also publishes the [[Global Corruption Barometer]], which ranks countries by corruption levels using direct surveys instead of perceived expert opinions, which has been under criticism for substantial bias from the powerful elite.&lt;ref name="Cobham, Alex"/&gt;

Transparency International has warned that a country with a clean CPI score may still be linked to corruption internationally. For example, while Sweden had the 3rd best CPI score in 2015, one of its state-owned companies, [[TeliaSonera]], was facing allegations of bribery in Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=cpi2015&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/cpi2015 CPI index 2015]. Accessed 2016-02-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Monteiro''', a 71-year-old man, was found dead on 30 July 2015 in [[Païta]], [[New Caledonia]]. He was reported missing two days earlier, and his vehicle and credit card had apparently been stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nouvellecaledonie.la1ere.fr/2015/07/30/le-corps-sans-vie-retrouve-paita-est-celui-de-daniel-monteiro-274545.html|title=Le corps sans vie retrouvé à Païta est celui de Daniel Monteiro|language=French|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=8 August 2015|agency=Nouvelle Calédonie 1ère}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors said he had been "savagely" beaten in a "wild way" to the point of unconsciousness, and then thrown into the Karikaté River, where he drowned. Two men were taken into custody in connection with the theft of his vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nouvellecaledonie.la1ere.fr/2015/08/01/daniel-monteiro-ete-battu-de-maniere-sauvage-extremement-violente-274789.html|title=Daniel Monteiro a été battu "de manière sauvage, extrêmement violente"|language=French|date=1 August 2015|accessdate=8 August 2015|agency=Nouvelle Calédonie 1ère}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 21-year-old woman confessed to Monteiro's slaying on 3 August 2015, according to French chief prosecutor [[Claire Lanet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nouvellecaledonie.la1ere.fr/2015/08/03/une-troisieme-personne-interpellee-dans-l-affaire-du-meurtre-de-daniel-monteiro-275501.html|title=Une jeune femme écrouée dans l'affaire du meurtre de Daniel Monteiro|language=French|date=3 August 2015|accessdate=8 August 2015|agency=Nouvelle Calédonie 1ère}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of Monteiro was notable for igniting a silent protest by more than 3,000 people, who walked through the streets of [[Nouméa]] on 8 August in a demonstration against recent violence in New Caledonia. The protest was led by Jennifer Seagoe, president of the Chamber of Commerce, who presented a white paper proposing reforms to curb violent crime to French High Commissioner [[Vincent Bouvier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/280838/concern-at-violent-attacks-stirs-mass-rally-in-new-caledonia|title=Concern at violent attacks stirs mass rally in New Caledonia|date=8 August 2015|accessdate=8 August 2015|agency=Radio New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[gang rape]] editorial photo shoot by [[Raj Shetye]] called ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The Wrong Turn''' featuring model [[Pooja Mor]] reminiscent of the [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi Gang Rape]] caused international outrage due to its insensitivity worldwide in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Fashion-shoot-on-Nirbhaya-rape-triggers-outrage/articleshow/39701128.cms | title='Fashion shoot’ on Nirbhaya rape triggers outrage | first1=Bahni | last1=Bandyopadhyay | first2=Aanchal | last2=Tuli | date=5 August 2014 | newspaper=The Times of India | accessdate=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-28670663|title=Delhi gang rape: India outrage over fashion shoot|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/delhi-gang-rape-photoshoot-bus-idINKBN0G810W20140808|title=Parents of Delhi gang rape victim decry fashion shoot that evokes attack|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/lifestyle/people/2014/08/12/delhi-gang-rape-fashion-shoot-angers-world/|title=Delhi ‘gang rape’ fashion shoot angers world|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/delhi-gang-rape-fashion-shoot-triggers-outrage_952938.html|title=`Delhi gang-rape` fashion shoot triggers outrage|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/photographer-sparks-outrage-for-depicting-delhi-gang-rape-in-pictures/article6288271.ece|title=Photographer sparks outrage for depicting Delhi gang rape in pictures|date=2014-08-06|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The shoot glamorised the 2012 Delhi Gang Rape  ''"...the photos show a model being sexually assaulted by men sitting on a set resembling a bus.

The parents of the gang rape victim dubbed [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Nirbhaya]] described the incident as ''"he...has mocked a girl's struggle.

[[National Commission for Women]] called for strict action against the photo shoot, Congress MP from [[Bihar]] [[Ranjeet Ranjan]] described the incident as disgusting and said she had given a notice in the Lok Sabha for discussion on the issue. Activist [[Abha Singh]] condemned the act saying it was "''not only a national shame but also legally a crime''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/photographer-sparks-outrage-for-depicting-delhi-gang-rape-in-pictures/article6288271.ece|title=Photographer sparks outrage for depicting Delhi gang rape in pictures|date=2014-08-06|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Jayne announced her debut concert tour in early August 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It consisted of 13 shows solely in the [[United States]]. The concert tour begins on September 28 and ends on December 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Go Behind the Scenes of Erika Jayne's Pretty Mess Tour Rehearsal|url=https://www.etonline.com/media/videos/go-behind-the-scenes-of-erika-jaynes-pretty-mess-tour-rehearsal-exclusive-110324|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on September 13, 2018, that her concert at [[Lincoln Hall (University of Illinois)|Lincoln Hall]] in [[Chicago]] was sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/erikajayne/status/1040296862241054720|title=Erika Jayne on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayne and Fullscreen Live announced eight additional dates to the tour schedule on September 24, 2018. She said the shows will be “fantasy, love, escape, glitz, glamour and fun.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.etonline.com/erika-jayne-is-balancing-housewives-drama-with-headlining-her-first-tour-and-its-a-lot-exclusive|title=Erika Jayne Is Balancing ‘RHOBH’ Drama With Her First Headlining Tour|work=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg Willis of ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' wrote "if her set on this new tour is anything like her headlining set at [[Los Angeles Pride|LA Pride]] in 2017 (where along with her own hits, she performed a cover of 90s dance classic “[[This Is Your Night (song)|This Is Your Night]]” by [[Amber (singer)|Amber]]), then we are definitely in for a treat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.out.com/entertainment/2018/8/09/get-ready-erika-jayne-coming-you|title=Get Ready: Erika Jayne Is Coming For You|date=2018-08-09|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayne's longtime collaborator, Mikey Minden, served as creative director of the tour.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine published exclusive sketches of Jayne's tour costumes on September 28, 2018.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://people.com/music/erika-jayne-tour-costume-sketches/|title='Fantasy, Love, Glamour!'

These looks describe different aspects of my personality and capture the essence of the show," Jayne told ''People''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Speaking on the tour, Jayne stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;"I'm so excited to get back on the stage this fall for The Pretty Mess Tour! The best part of it all is finally getting to meet so many fans across the county. Get ready, my pretties!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eonline.com/news/958760/real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-star-erika-jayne-announces-the-pretty-mess-tour Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Star Erika Jayne Announces The Pretty Mess Tour]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Alice Laussade of ''[[D Magazine|D magazine]]'' wrote that "if you know Erika Jayne’s [[NSFW]] style of music, you wouldn’t guess that she and [[Taylor Swift]] have similar fan bases. I would, though, because I know a lot of moms. Moms scream-sing Taylor Swift with their kids in the morning carpool line, and watch [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]]’s ''[[Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'' while they chug cans of wine at night."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/some-thoughts-on-taylor-swift-and-erika-jaynes-glittery-pantless-performances/|title=Some Thoughts On Taylor Swift and Erika Jayne's Glittery, Pantless Performances - D Magazine|date=2018-10-08|work=D Magazine|access-date=2018-10-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laussade also noted that fan fashion was part of the concert, seeing fans wearing "thigh-high boots, sequins, pink leather jackets paired with crazy-long blonde extensions, white Sambas paired with fancy athleisurewear, and a group of folks in SeeYouNextTuesday* shirts (of course, referencing her golden necklace worn on RHOBH)."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Nina Bradley of ''[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]]'' wrote that "with a [[New York Times bestseller|''New York Times bestseller'']] and a recent [[Ted Talk|TED Talk]] now added to her impressive [[résumé]], Erika Jayne's upcoming Pretty Mess tour is just the latest must-see event to come from the reality star — which means tickets are going to go fast."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-get-tickets-to-erika-jaynes-pretty-mess-tour-to-experience-all-the-glamour-in-person-12060284|title=How To Get Tickets To Erika Jayne's 'Pretty Mess' Tour Before They Sell Out|last=Bradley|first=Nina|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several celebrities, including [[January Jones]], [[Jasmine Tookes]], [[Kyle Richards]] and [[Lisa Rinna]] came to support her concert at The Globe Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BoZm0kEgt5Y/?taken-by=theprettymess|title=Erika Jayne on Instagram: “Then an angel appeared!

The '''Battery Tender Global MX-5 Cup''' is the professional [[Spec Miata]] series sanctioned by [[IndyCar]] in the [[United States]]. The pro Spec Miata series has its roots in 2003, but a unified national championship was launched in 2006.

==History==
The [[Mazda MX-5 (NA)|first generation Mazda MX-5]] or Mazda Miata was launched in the U.S. market in May 1989 (model year 1990). The [[Sports Car Club of America]] placed the car in the [[Production car racing|Showroom Stock C]] class for production vehicles with a 1.600cc engine. The rules allowed the car to be entered in races when the model was one year old, in 1991. As production and popularity of the sports car grew the SCCA developed a separate class for the car. After an exhibition race at [[Road Atlanta]] in 1999 an SCCA regional class was launched in 2000. In professional autosport the Miata's were entered in the [[Pirelli World Challenge|SCCA World Challenge]], but without major results.

===Mazdaspeed Miata Cup===
The [[Mazdaspeed]] Miata Cup was launched for 2003 with a Pacific and an Atlantic championship. The series first race was run at [[BeaveRun Motorsports Complex]] on May 3rd and 4th 2003. [[Chip Herr]] and [[Niki Coello]] won the two races over the weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Mazdaspeed Miata Cup Presented by Hankook Tires  Atlantic Tour Round One &amp; Two|url=http://users.zoominternet.net/~blacktopracing/2003_Results/mazdaspeed_miata_cup_1-2.htm|website=Black Top Racing|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niki Coello went on to win the Atlantic Tour championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=Thomas|title=Mazda MX-5 Miata|publisher=Motorbooks|page=134|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=7feKBAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=2003+mazdaspeed+miata+cup&amp;hl=nl&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bobby Carter (racing driver)|Bobby Carter]] won the inaugural Pacific Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miata Cup: Pacific Tour Phoenix preview|url=http://www.motorsport.com/scca/news/miata-cup-pacific-tour-phoenix-preview/|website=Motorsport.com|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Henri Poincaré]] Prize''' sponsored by the [[Daniel Iagolnitzer Foundation]] was created in 1997 to recognize outstanding contributions in [[mathematical physics]], and contributions which lay the groundwork for novel developments in this broad field. The Prize is also created to recognize and support young people of exceptional promise who have already made outstanding contributions to the field of mathematical physics. The prize is awarded to three individuals every three years at the [[International Congress on Mathematical Physics]]. The prize committee is appointed by the [[International Association of Mathematical Physics]] (IAMP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4840">'''High Noon in Hong Kong''' was a [[World Boxing Organisation]] sanctioned boxing event. It was to feature four fights: a heavyweight title fight between [[Herbie Hide]] and [[Tommy Morrison]]; [[Steve Collins]] versus American Lonnie Beasley for the WBO middleweight title; [[Billy Schwer]] would challenge [[Rafael Ruelas]] for the IBF lightweight title, plus [[Frank Bruno]] versus [[Ray Mercer]] in a non-title fight in the [[Hong Kong Stadium]] on 22 October 1994. It was cancelled at the last minute because of major financial problems.

==Beginning==
According to British sports promoter [[Barry Hearn]], he met [[John Daly (producer)|John Daly]], a Los Angeles-based Londoner, in June 1994, who asked him to provide boxers for the event. American boxing promoter [[Bob Arum]] was providing [[Tommy Morrison]] and Barry Hearn would provide [[Herbie Hide]] and [[Steve Collins]]. [[Mickey Duff]] and Jarvis Astaire provided [[Frank Bruno]] for a non-title fight with [[Ray Mercer]], as well as Billy Schwer for the IBF lightweight title challenge against Rafael Ruelas. 

The four-fight High Noon show at the Hong Kong Stadium was offered as pay-per-view with a cash flow estimated at US$2.3 million, expected from the American public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/archive_news_detail.asp?pp_cat=&amp;art_id=56790&amp;sid=&amp;con_type=1&amp;archive_d_str=19950906 Sport's real fans being forced to pay the price]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
Barry Hearn withdrew his boxers, Herbie Hide and Steve Collins, when their purse guarantees were not in place by the deadline of 5.30 pm local time on Saturday. Bob Arum was the event's nominal promoter but refused to come up with the cash to save it. Daly tried to raise the money which, according to Arum, was around US$2m.

When the local bankers whom Daly thought had agreed to salvage the show refused to advance him a further US$771,000 against anticipated revenue from ticket sales and American pay-per-view subscriptions at US$25 each, Daly had no choice. He said that the boxers' purses were Arum's responsibility, which Arum did not agree with.

Daly had spent at least US$800,000 of his own money into it. "My end of the deal was kept," Daly argued. "I had to arrange the stadium, air fares and all the pre-fight promotional expenses, which I did, but the purses were not part of my obligation."

The 2,000-odd fight fans in Hong Kong who bought tickets, some worth a couple of thousand dollars, had yet to receive refunds a year later.

==Responses==
Frank Bruno said: "I feel very let down by Bob Arum and the promoters. They were supposed to be top professionals, the creme de la creme. I thought they were the business, but to be quite honest they've been unprofessional, totally unprofessional."

"To cancel a promotion just like that without consulting anyone is very serious. A lot of money has been going into this. Top Rank are big promoters and they should have dug deep in their pockets - they've made enough money out of fighters over the years."

"It's tough for all the fighters, and for the people who worked five days a week to afford to come over here and support us. It's disgusting. It's staggering."

Mickey Duff, who plans to sue Arum and [[Top Rank Boxing|Top Rank]] on behalf of Bruno and Billy Schwer said: "What kind of promoters are these? I've been in the business 45 years and I've never cancelled a show just because I was going to lose money. I'd rather cut my throat than do that."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/boxing-everybody-blames-each-other-for-fight-fiasco-high-noon-in-hong-kong-promised-much-but-delivered-only-grief-as-harry-mullan-discovered-1444746.html Boxing: Everybody blames each other for fight fiasco: High Noon in Hong Kong promised much but delivered only grief, as Harry Mullan discovered]&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, [[Gujarat]] celebrates more than 200 festivals. The '''International Kite Festival (Uttarayan)''' is  regarded as one of the biggest festivals celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Subhamoy|first=Das|title=Uttarayan &amp; the Kite Festival of Gujarat|url=http://hinduism.about.com/cs/festivals/a/aa011103a.htm|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Months before the festival, homes in Gujarat begin to manufacture kites for the festival.

The festival of Uttarayan marks the day when winter begins to turn into summer, according to the [[Hindu calendar|Indian calendar]]. It is the sign for farmers that the sun is back and that harvest season is approaching which is called [[Makara Sankranti]]. This day is considered to be one of the most important harvest day in India. Many cities in Gujarat organize kite competition between their citizens where the people all compete with each other. In this region of Gujarat and many other states, Uttarayan is such a huge celebration that it has become a [[Public holidays in India#Hindu holidays|public holiday in India]] for two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Subhamoy|first=Das|title=Uttarayan &amp; the Kite Festival of Gujarat|url=http://hinduism.about.com/cs/festivals/a/aa011103a.htm|publisher=www.about.com/|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the festival, local food such as [[Undhiyu]] (a mixed vegetable including yam and beans), sesame seed brittle and [[Jalebi]] is served to the crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Desai|first=Anjali|title=India Guide Gujarat|year=2007|publisher=India Guide Publication|location=India|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZRLGZNZEoEC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=international+kite+festival+gujarat#v=onepage&amp;q=international%20kite%20festival%20gujarat&amp;f=false|isbn=9780978951702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Kite Festival Ahmedabad|url=http://www.khazano.com/aspx/FestivalFair.asp|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days before the festival, the market is filled with participants buying their supplies. In 2012, the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat mentioned that the International Kite Festival in Gujarat was attempting to enter the [[Guinness World Records]] book due to the participation of 42 countries in it that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sahu|first=Deepika|title=Gujarat kite festival to go global|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-11/travel/30612255_1_international-kite-festival-uttarayan-global-brand|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The International Kite Festival takes place in [[Gujarat]] [[India]]. The festival is called [http://sheokhanda.wordpress.com/2010/07/16/uttarayan-%E2%80%93-the-international-kite-festival/ Uttarayan]. The festival is celebrated in many cities of Gujarat, Telangana and Rajasthan like Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Udaipur,Jodhpur, [[Surat]], [[Vadodara]], [[Rajkot]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Nadiad]], [[Dakor]]. However, the International Kite Event takes place in [[Ahmedabad#Festivals|Ahmedabad]] (Kite capital of Gujarat) which accommodates visitors from many international destinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ahmedabad sky thrilled with colourful kites, Modi spellbound|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2012/01/12/kite-festival-starts-ahmedabad-narendra-modi-enthralled.html|accessdate=3 November 2012|newspaper=www.oneindia.in|date=12 January 2012|author=Nairita}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WebIndia. [http://www.webindia123.com/city/andhra/hyderabad/destinations/fairs_festivals/internationalkitefestival.htm "Hyderabad Kites Festival"]. Retrieved 15 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best place to enjoy this festival is the [[Sabarmati Riverfront]] (its sabarmati river bank with capacity of over 500,000 people) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabarmati River Front Ahmedabad|url=http://www.ahmedabadkiteflyers.org/international-kite-festival-ahmedabad-gujarat/|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Ahmedabad Police Stadium, where people lay down to see the sky filled with thousands of kites &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Solanki|first=Paavan|title=International Kite Festival Gujarat 2016|url=http://www.ahmedabadkiteflyers.org/international-kite-festival-ahmedabad-gujarat/|publisher=Royal Kite Flyers Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the festival week the markets are flooded with kite buyers and sellers. In the heart of Ahmedabad, there is one of the most famous Kite markets - ''Patang Bazaar'', which during the festive week opens 24 hours a day with buyers and sellers negotiating and buying in bulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rob|title=Uttarayan International Kite Festival Gujarat|url=http://www.1000lonelyplaces.com/carnivals/uttarayan-international-kite-festival-gujarat-2011/|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a Kite Museum, located at Sanskar Kendra in [[Paldi]] area of Ahmedabad. Established in 1985, it contains a collection of unique kites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Kite Museum|url=http://www.holidayiq.com/Kite-Museum-Ahmedabad-Sightseeing-256-258.html|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parts of India also celebrate kite festival. In Delhi on 15 August and most of Bihar's districts on 14 April. It is said because they just prepare new crop wheat. People offer prayers, eat [[Sattu]] (made from new crop wheat) and new mangoes (baby mango also known as ''Tikola'').

==Dates==
The festival takes place on 14 January of each year during the [[Makar Sankranti]] and continues until 15 January. This date marks the end of winter and the return of a more clement weather for farmers of the Gujarat region. These days have also become a public holiday within the Gujarat state of India so that everyone can take part in the celebration. 15th January is known as ' Vasi Uttarayan '.

==History==
The symbolism of this festival is to show the awakening of the Gods from their deep sleep. Through India's history, it is said that India created the tradition of kite flying due to the kings and Royalties later followed by [[Nawabs]] who found the sport entertaining and as a way to display their skills and power. It began as being a sport for kings, but over time, as the sport became popular, it began to reach the masses. Kite flying has been a regional event in Gujarat for several years. However the first International Festival was celebrated in 1989 when people from all across the globe participated and showcased their innovative kites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Kite festival|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/gujarat/fairs-and-festivals/international-kite-festival.html|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Subhamoy|first=Das|title=Uttarayan &amp; the Kite Festival of Gujarat|url=http://hinduism.about.com/cs/festivals/a/aa011103a.htm|publisher=About.com Guide|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the recent 2012 event, The International Kite Festival was inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] in the presence of Governor [[Kamla Beniwal|Dr. Kamla]].

==Participants==
[[File:Colored Kites.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pile of colored kites, prepared for the Uttarayan festival]]

Although the idea of flying kites to celebrate Uttrayan was introduced by Muslims from Persia,{{fact|date=April 2017}} today regardless of your background or beliefs, you are welcome to fly kites with everyone else in Gujarat in January. Most visitors arrive from around India, from Gujarat itself or another state.  In major cities of Gujarat, kite flying starts as early as 5 am and goes until late night where approximately 8-10 million people participate in the whole festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aggarwal|first=Priya|title=International Kite festival|url=http://www.easydestination.net/blog/?itemid=2569|publisher=Travel Events|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many visitors are international who come from around the world, such as Japan, Italy, UK, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, Australia, the USA, Malaysia, Singapore, France, China, and many more to take part in the celebration.

The kite festival has been strongly influenced by its international participants, in the recent events, for instance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uttarayan: International Kite Festival in Gujarat|url=http://www.cnngo.com/mumbai/play/uttarayan-international-kite-festival-gujarat-460042|publisher=CNN GO|accessdate=24 October 2012|author=CNN|date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* USA brought giant banner kites
* Japan brought [[Rokkaku dako|Rokkaku]] fighting kites
* Italy brought Italian sculptural kites
* Chinese brought Flying Dragon kites
* For other kites, see list of [[Kite types]]

At the same time, the festival is the occasion for many public entities such as famous dancers, singers, actors or politicians who make an appearance and entertain the population. In 2004, for example, the [[Bollywood]] actress [[Juhi Chawla]] was part of the celebration and performed a [[Garba (dance)]] which is very popular in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deccan|first=Herald|title=International Kite Festival, Ahmedabad|url=http://www.carnetdevol.org/actualite/inde/india.htm|publisher= www.carnetdevol.org|date= 13 January 2004|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of kites==

During the event, kite markets are set up alongside food stalls and performers. The kites are usually made with materials such as plastic, leaves, wood, metal, nylon and other scrap materials but the ones for Uttarayan are made of light-weight paper and bamboo and are mostly rhombus shaped with central spine and a single bow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kite Basics|url=http://www.drachen.org/learn/kite-basics|publisher=www.drachen.org|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dye and paint are also added  to increase the glamour of the kite. The lines are covered with mixtures of glue and ground glass which when dried, rolled up and attached to the rear, also known as firkees, become sharp enough to cut skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herald|first=Deccan|title=International Kite Festival Ahmedabad (Gujarat - Inde)|url=http://www.carnetdevol.org/actualite/inde/india.htm|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sharp lines are used on [[fighter kite]]s known in India as ''patangs'' to cut down other kites during various kite fighting events. During the night, on the second day of the festival, illuminated kites filled with lights and candles known as tukals or tukkals are launched creating a spectacle in the dark sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAIRS &amp; FESTIVALS OF AHMEDABAD|url=http://www.indiainfoweb.com/gujarat/ahmedabad/festive-fun.html|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Gujarat kites are made up of two types of paper that is :-

2.Butter paper kites.

The '''Ispah rebellion''' ({{zh|c=亦思巴奚兵乱|p=Yìsībāxī Bīngluàn}}) was a series of civil wars occurring in the middle of 14th century in [[Fujian]] under the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The term '''Ispah''' might derive from the [[Persian language|Persian word]] "سپاه" (''sepâh''), meaning "army" or "[[Sepoy]]". Thus, the rebellion is also known as the '''Persian Sepoy rebellion''' (波斯戍兵之乱; ''Bōsī Shùbīng zhī Luàn'') in Chinese documents.

[[File:Hsing-hua 1362.jpg|thumb|300px|Situation in Xinghua in 1362, during the rebellion]]
Under [[Mongols|Mongol]] rule, the number of [[Arabs|Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Muslim]]s residing in the Chinese [[port]] city of [[Quanzhou]] was greatly boosted. In 1357, a predominantly Muslim army led by two Quanzhou Muslims, Sayf ad-Din (赛甫丁) and Amir ad-Din (阿迷里丁), revolted against the Yuan dynasty. In defiance of imperial forces, the army seized control of Quanzhou, [[Putian]], and even reached the provincial capital [[Fuzhou]].

In 1362, the Ispah army collapsed into internal conflict and was eventually crushed in 1366 by the [[Han Chinese]] commander [[Chen Youding]] (陈友定), who was loyal to the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/chinese-iranian-vii | title=CHINESE-IRANIAN RELATIONS vii.

==Historical background==
From the 13th century to the early 14th century in the Yuan dynasty, overseas trade was extremely prosperous in Fujian. As the starting point of the [[Maritime Silk Road]], Quanzhou was China's, possibly the world's, largest port.&lt;ref name="《伊本・白图泰游记》"&gt;伊本・白图泰（著）、马金鹏（译），《伊本・白图泰游记》，宁夏人民出版社，2005年&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=中国网事:千年古港福建"泉州港"被整合改名引网民争议|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2012-04/11/c_111763389.htm|publisher=新华网|accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the largest city in Fujian, with a population exceeding that of Fuzhou, Fujian's administrative center.&lt;ref name="福建通史"&gt;徐晓望，福建通史，福建人民出版社，2006年&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabs called it "Tiger's claw", which has been used by merchants in Europe and elsewhere. At the time, Quanzhou's population exceeded 2 million, with a wall as long as 30 miles. Jinjiang's river and its harbor had 10,000 ships docked, with highly developed trade.&lt;ref name="福建通史"/&gt;&lt;ref name="《光明之城》缩写本"&gt;（意）雅各・德安科纳 原著、（英）塞尔本 编译、（泉州海交馆）李玉昆、陈丽华、叶恩典 缩写，[http://www.qzwb.com/qzx/content/2006-08/22/content_2166827.htm 《光明之城》缩写本]，中国泉州学研究&lt;/ref&gt; Quanzhou exported luxuries such as silk, ceramics, copper, and iron, as well as satin, while imports include pearls, ivory, rhino horns, frankincense, etc. The most important imports were spices and herbs.

Quanzhou had many foreign residents, such as [[Arabs]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Europeans]], [[Jews]], [[Indian people|Indians]] etc. There were around 100 different languages being used. The Quanzhou people labeled these foreigners as Fan ("蕃" or "番"). Due to the massive number of foreigners coming in, authorities didn't want foreigners to stay and interfere with the locals' lifestyles in the beginning. Quanzhou had large [[ethnic enclave]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s ("蕃坊", "蕃人巷"), with foreigners and natives often intermarrying and giving birth to mixed children (often labeled Half Southern Fan or "半南蕃").&lt;ref name="宋元泉州外侨社区的兴衰及其启示"&gt;王四达，宋元泉州外侨社区的兴衰及其启示，《东南文化》2008年第1期&lt;/ref&gt; Although foreigners and natives had some cultural intermingling, the foreigners still practiced and spread their own religions, such as [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Manichaeism]], [[Hinduism]], etc. This religious and [[ethnic diversity]] made management much harder.&lt;ref name="《泉州市志》"&gt;泉州市地方志编纂委员会，《泉州市志》，中国社会科学出版社，2000.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origin of the name "Ispah"==

There are multiple theories about the origin of the word "Ispah". Some think that "Ispah" originated from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word "سپاه"(sepâh), which means militia, cavalry, or some derived version. It could also be the Persian equivalent of "mercenaries" or borrowed from the name of a city, Isfahan, given that most of the people came from that city. Others believe that Ispah is used for designating troops, instead of as an actual name.

==Beginning==
In the early Yuan dynasty, the Mongols gave the [[Islamic]] [[Sunni]] [[Semu]] [[Pu Shougeng]] (蒲寿庚) family public support, since they helped rebel against the Song dynasty and establish the Yuan dynasty. As a result, this family became stronger and had more influence over politics and the economy. The Sunni Muslims in Quanzhou became more dominant in Quanzhou and excluded the [[Shiites]], causing growing resentment among them. In 1282 (the 19th year of the Yuan dynasty), the Yuan dynasty stationed 3000 Shiite forces in Quanzhou, but even then there were still too few Shiites in Quanzhou.&lt;ref name="也论元末亦思巴奚战乱的性质"&gt;张忠君、兰陈妍，也论元末亦思巴奚战乱的性质，《黔东南民族师范高等专科学校学报》2003年第21卷第5期&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the government struggled to deal with various armed rebellions. The Quanzhou Shiite Persians organized the Ispah army to defend their ethnic group, which already had a large Persian population with growing strength. In March 1357, Sayf ad-Din  and Amir ad-Din, the commanders of the Ispah army, seized the opportunity to control Quanzhou,&lt;ref name="《元史》·卷四十五"&gt;《元史》·卷四十五&lt;/ref&gt; and suppressed the formerly dominant Sunni. The Ispah army became one of the strongest forces in Fujian.

==Massacre of foreigners==
{{see also|Iranians in China}}

Afterwards many of the foreign Arab and Persian merchants were massacred when the uprising was crushed and their graves desecrated, forcing many of them to flee Quanzhou. Some of the massacres and grave desecrations were reprisals against the descendants of Pu Shougeng, who had defected and surrendered the cities to the Mongols during their invasion of the Song dynasty.

In revenge over Pu Shougeng's defection to the Yuan dynasty, here were mass killings against the descendants of Pu Shougeng.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garnaut |first1=Anthony|date=March 2006 |title=The Islamic Heritage in China: A General Survey |url=http://www.muslimheritage.com/article/islamic-heritage-china |journal=China Heritage Newsletter |volume= |issue=5 |pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the Han Chinese Li family in Quanzhou, [[Lin Nu]], the son of Li Lu, visited [[Ormus|Hormuz]] in [[Persia]] in 1376, married a [[Persian people|Persian]] or an [[Arab]] girl, and brought her back to [[Quanzhou]]. Li Nu was the ancestor of the Ming Dynasty reformer [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Chih]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=067On0JgItAC&amp;pg=PA817&amp;dq=ch'ang+fond+persian+girl&amp;q=li%20nu%20married%20an%20arab%20or%20persian%20girl|title=A-L, Volumes 1-2|author=Association for Asian studies (Ann Arbor;Michigan)|year=1976|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=|page=817|isbn=978-0-231-03801-0|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranica.com/articles/chinese-iranian-vii|title=CHINESE-IRANIAN RELATIONS vii.

The branch of the family who held to their Chinese customs felt ashamed so they changed their surname from Lin to Li to avoid associating with their relatives, Lin Nu's descendants with his Persian wife who practiced Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Kühner, Hans. “‘The Barbarians' Writing Is like Worms, and Their Speech Is like the Screeching of Owls’ - Exclusion and Acculturation in the Early Ming Period.” Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, vol. 151, no. 2, 2001, pp. 407–429.

'''''Jerky Turkey''''' is a [[1945 in film|1945]] [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] cartoon directed by [[Tex Avery]].

==Plot==
In 1620{{fraction|7|8}}, [[Pilgrim]]s, riding a caricatured ''[[Mayflower]]'' with a number of [[World War II]]-era [[anachronism]]s (such as a navy gunnery deck, a [[Henry J. Kaiser]] nameplate and a [[Rationing in the United States|fuel rationing card]]) land at [[Plymouth Rock]] and establish [[Plymouth Colony|a colony]], where they quickly separate into "Ye [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]" and "Ye [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]." The Pilgrims all stand in line for cigarettes (some are caricatures of Avery's animation crew), while the [[town crier]] bemoans that he has been made eligible for the [[Selective Service System|draft]] {"1-A"}. 

A pear-shaped Pilgrim, who speaks with the milquetoast mannerisms of [[Bill Thompson (voice actor)|Bill Thompson]] (who was unavailable and had to be impersonated because of his being inducted into war service), emerges from his dilapidated [[teardrop trailer]] home and goes hunting for a [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] for a [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. The turkey emerges from the "[[House of the Seven Gables|House of Seven Gobbles]]" (a literal [[black market]] in disguise) and, seeing an easy mark and speaking in an impersonation of [[Jimmy Durante]], offers himself to the pilgrim, only to use this as the start of a series of rapid-fire gags that stretch the limits of even [[cartoon physics]], with the turkey consistently getting the best of his increasingly befuddled and frustrated opponent.  Eventually the two make up and decide to "[[eat at Joe's]]," following the advice of a clapboard-wearing bear advertising his steakhouse that appears throughout the film. When they reach Joe's steakhouse, the door closes, loud crashes and thuds are heard, and Joe the bear is seen coming out of the restaurant without his sandwich board; on his back is a tattoo which reads "I'm Joe". The bear is  grinning and picking his teeth, as the swallowed-whole turkey and pilgrim sulk in the bear's stomach. The pilgrim closes the cartoon holding up a sign of his own: "DON'T eat at Joe's."

The increasing significance of Beagle channel region led to various incidents and confrontations between Chile and Argentina around transit and fishing rights, which could potentially lead to full-scale war.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Struthers, [http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2011/September/11Sep_Upp.pdf ''The Beagle Channel Dispute Between Argentina and Chile: An historical Analysis''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425065410/http://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/theses/2011/September/11Sep_Upp.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}, Master of Science in Strategic Intelligence, May 1985, page 63 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentine request for demarcation in 1904==
On 23 August 1904 the Argentine government asked Chile to demarcate the boundary on the Beagle Channel.&lt;ref&gt;Note N° 154 of 23 August 1904, by the Chilean Minister in Buenos Aires to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Chile)]] in Santiago, cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=sCK1HewqBaIC ''Historia de las Relaciones Exteriores de Chile, Arbritaje británico de 1899-1903''], Octavio Errázuriz Guilisasti and Germán Carrasco Domínguez, Editorial Andrés Bello, 1968, Santiago de Chile, page 91&lt;/ref&gt; Chile didn't consider it necessary because there were a complete cartography of the channel and the treaty awarded the islands depending on the location.

==Chilean decree 1914==
In order to avoid belligerents activities in [[Strait of Magellan]], which would impede navigation, on 15 December 1914 Chile declared that the internal waters of the [[Strait of Magellan]] as well as the channels around should be considered as a [[Territorial waters|Territorial]] or [[Neutrality (international relations)|Neutral Sea]] even where they extend more than three miles from shore.&lt;ref name="MAM"&gt;Michel A. Morris, ''The Strait of Magellan'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=71}} In 1914 a German merchant was inspected by a British warship and on 14 March a Norwegian ship was seized by a British warship. Argentina protested the Chilean decree on 8 March 1915 but didn't specified the reasons.&lt;ref name="MAM"/&gt;{{rp|page=72}}

==The Snipe Incident==
{{main|Snipe incident}}

In 1958 the Argentine Navy shelled a Chilean lighthouse in the (uninhabited) Snipe islet and occupied the island. Both ambassadors were recalled, the Chilean Navy was sent to the zone and the Argentine Marines were pulled back from the island. It was the most serious incident that occurred in the zone.

==''Ballenita'' Incident==

In July 1967 the master of [[Panama]]nian ship ''Ballenita'' was fined in Chile after he accepted an Argentine pilot for the route to Ushuaia. As result, Chilean pilots have to board ships bound to the Beagle Channel in [[Montevideo]] and no longer in [[Buenos Aires]].

==''Cruz del Sur'' Incident==

The lucrative centolla fishery around [[Tierra del Fuego]] led to an incident in August 1967 when the Argentine [[schooner]] ''{{lang|es|Cruz del Sur}}'' was found fishing {{convert|400|m}} from [[Gable Island]] and had to be ordered by a Chilean Patrol Boat ''{{lang|es|Marinero Fuentealba}}''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Patricia Arancibia Clavel &amp; Francisco Bulnes Serrano |year=2004 |title=La Escuadra En Acción: 1978: el conflicto Chile-Argentina visto a través de sus protagonistas |publisher=Maval Ltda |location=[[Santiago]] |isbn=956-258-211-6 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to retrieve her nets and leave the zone escorted out of Chilean waters.

Few days later the ship re-appeared in the company of an Argentine patrol craft. Protests from both sides were issued at the highest diplomatic level.

==''Quidora'' Incident==

On 29 November 1967 the Chilean Patrol Boat [[Quidora (PTF-82)|''Quidora'' (PTF-82)]] was shelled by the Argentine Navy from Ushuaia.

==The ''USCGC Southwind'' affair==

On 3 February 1968 the [[USCGC Southwind (WAGB-280)|''USCGC Southwind'']] in emergency conditions headed to Ushuaia via the eastern entrance of the Beagle Channel without notification nor permission of the Chilean Government. The Chileans protested.

==The ''Barnevelt'' incident==

On 21 May 1977, after the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration|arbitral award]], the Argentine Navy installed a lighthouse in the (inhabited) Barnevelt Island. It was immediately dismantled by the Chilean Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Renato Valenzuela Ugarte and Fernando García Toso in ''A treinta años de la crisis del Beagle'', Magazine ''Politica y Estrategia'', nr 111, 2008, page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==On the east mouth of the Magellan Strait==
On 8 June 1978 Chile sent a diplomatic objection to Argentine activities off the eastern mouth of the Magellan Strait and reserving rights there. In September 1980 a offshore oil rig authorized by Argentina was warned by a Chilean warship and then by military helicopter to abandon the area. Also an Argentine military aircraft threatened a Chilean warship proceeding toward the Strait of Magellan from the [[Falkland Islands]].&lt;ref name="MAM"/&gt;{{rp|page=83ff}}

==ARA ''Gurruchaga'' incident==
On February 19 1982, six weeks before the beginning of the [[Falklands War]], an incident occurred that could have sparked a full-fledged war between Chile and Argentina during the [[Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict]]. An Argentine patrol boat, the ARA ''Gurruchaga'' (Ex-[[USS Luiseno (ATF-156)]]) was anchored at [[Hermite Islands|Deceit Island]] inside the Beagle zone under mediation in Vatican, ostensibly providing support for sports boats participating in the Rio de Janeiro-Sydney boat race. The ''Quidora'' torpedo Boat approached and ordered the Argentine ship to leave the area. She fired several warning shots when the Argentine craft refused to move, as other Chilean ships converged to the scene. Although originally ordered not to leave the area and to wait for Argentine warships to arrive, the Argentine patrol boat received new orders to proceed to port as it became obvious that the Chilean navy had no intentions of backing down.&lt;ref name="Hunt1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.

==The shelling of faro de Gusanos==

On 19 October 1984, as the Chilean and Argentine delegations signed the first agreement to the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina]], the Argentine [[Artillery|artillery units]] fired eight rounds on the Chilean lighthouse "Gusanos" near [[Puerto Williams]] on the south shore of the Beagle Channel.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Pittsburgh Press]] article [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zBshAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FWEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6997,1296845&amp;hl=en Argentina accused of violating pact], on  - Oct 18, 1984, retrieved 1 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/VATICANO/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/Argentina/Chile/firman/Vaticano/compromiso/pone/fin/disputa/historica/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19841019elpepiint_7/Tes] in Spanish newspaper [[El País]] on 19 October 1984, retrieved on 1 Februarz 2012&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Load shifting''' is a dangerous phenomenon in water, air, and ground transportation where many small moveable items (for example, coal) shifts or spills towards the downward side when the cargo vehicle consistently tips past 10 or 15 degrees. Over time, this can lead to escalating tilting of the cargo vehicle and can lead to tipping or eventual capsizing. Such a dangerous occurrence is prevented by active load management, avoidance of high sea conditions, and proper container/bulkhead design.

On a cargo airplane, a professional [[loadmaster]] is necessary to prevent the highly-dangerous phenomenon of load shifting. If a plane begins to take off with unsecured cargo, some of the cargo may slide to the aft of the airplane, resulting in a catastrophic switch in the centre-of-gravity and a [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] condition. The [[National Airlines Flight 102]] disaster is currently believed to be a result of load shifting.

[[File:Le premier 'London-to-Brighton veteran car run' en novembre 1927 (pour véhicules de plus de trente ans).jpg|thumb|The first run, in November 1927, only for vehicles over thirty years old.]]
[[File:London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Finish line of the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, 2005]]
The '''London to Brighton Veteran Car Run''' is the longest-running motoring event in the world. The first run was in 1896, and it has taken place most years since its initial revival in 1927. To qualify, the cars must have been built before 1905. It is also the world's largest gathering of veteran cars&amp;nbsp;– 443 started in 2005, 484 in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;''Motor Sport'', January 2010, Page 113.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 37 starters in 1927, 51 starters in 1930 and 131 in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 24 November 1930, Page 9; ''The Scotsman'', 15 November 1938, Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes place, currently, on the first Sunday in November and starts at sunrise from [[Hyde Park, London]] and mostly follows the old [[A23 road]] to finish at [[Brighton]]&amp;nbsp;– a distance of {{convert|54|mi}}. There are two official stops along the way: [[Crawley]] (for coffee) and [[Preston Park, Brighton|Preston Park]] (in a suburb of Brighton). Preston Park is the official finishing point; the cars then proceed to Madeira Drive on the seafront, also the venue for Brighton's other big motoring event, the [[Brighton Speed Trials]].

The organisers emphasise that the event is not a race&amp;nbsp;– they do not even publish the order in which cars finish, and participants are not permitted to exceed an average speed of {{convert|20|mph|abbr=on}}. Any that finish (many do not) before 4:30&amp;nbsp;pm are awarded a medal.

There are a few other events preceding the Veteran Car Run such as Motoring Forum, Veteran Car Run Sale, a motor show, and participant reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rove.me/to/england/london-to-brighton-veteran-car-run|title=London to Brighton Veteran Car Run|publisher=rove.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first run took place on 14 November 1896, a wet Saturday.&lt;ref name=Autocar196611&gt;{{cite magazine| authorlink = F J Bonham (Maurice A Smith&amp;nbsp;– Ed)| title = Personal Memories of the First Brighton Run|magazine=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] | volume = 125 (nbr 3690)|page=978 |date = 4 November 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organised by [[Harry J. Lawson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|title=Drive On!: A Social History of the Motor Car
|publisher=Granta Books

|isbn=1-86207-698-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and named "The Emancipation Run", it was a celebration of the recently passed [[Locomotives on Highways Act 1896]], which had replaced the restrictive [[Locomotive Act]]s of 1861, 1865 and 1878 and increased the speed limit to {{convert|14|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Since 1878 the speed limit had been {{convert|4|mph|0|abbr=on}} in the country and {{convert|2|mph|0|abbr=on}} in the town and an escort had been required to walk {{convert|20|yd|m|0}} ahead of the vehicle. The 1865 act had required the escort to carry a red flag at a distance of {{convert|60|yd|m|0}}.&lt;ref name=Motor196611&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink = Richard Bensted-Smith (Ed)|title = The long road south|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume = | pages =38–39| date = 5 November 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The run was also the first meet of the Motor Car Club, of which Lawson was President. 

The event started with a breakfast at the [[Charing Cross Hotel]], which included the symbolic tearing in two by [[Murray Finch-Hatton, 12th Earl of Winchilsea|Lord Winchelsea]] of a red flag.&lt;ref name=Autocar196611/&gt; The competitors gathered outside the [[Metropole Hotel, London|Metropole Hotel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklands.org.uk/Montagu/MONT1.HTM |title=Just the weather for a seaside trip |publisher=The Times/Beaulieu |date=2 November 1996 |accessdate=21 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830041450/http://www.brooklands.org.uk/Montagu/MONT1.HTM |archivedate=30 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the cars accompanied by a "flying escort"&amp;nbsp;– estimated by one witness as "probably 10,000"&amp;nbsp;– of pedal cyclists, recreational cycling having become popular with the English in the final decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Autocar196611/&gt; A total of 33&amp;nbsp;motorists set off from London for the coast and 17 arrived in Brighton.&lt;ref name=Motor196611/&gt; The first of the cars set off from London at 10:30&amp;nbsp;am and the first arrival in Brighton, by a [[Duryea Motor Wagon]], beating the next closest Brighton arrivals by more than an hour.&lt;ref name=Autocar196611/&gt; Two [[Duryea Motor Wagon Company|Duryea]] cars participated in the run, marking the first appearance of American motor vehicles in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Automobile Manufacturers Association Inc., ''Automobiles of America'', Wayne State University Press, Detroit, 1968, Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next few years, Commemoration Run took place between Whitehall Place and Sheen House Club covering the distance of about eight miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.veterancarrun.com/event-info|title=Event Info|publisher=The Royal Automobile Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The run was not staged again until 1927, and then annually run from 1927 until the onset of the Second World War. Owing to petrol rationing, the event was cancelled until 1947. With all this considered, it is the world's longest running motoring event. Since 1930, the event has been controlled by the [[Royal Automobile Club]].

The 1953 comedy movie ''[[Genevieve (film)|Genevieve]]'' is set during one of these runs.

==Participants==

Many racing drivers and celebrities have taken part in the event, including [[Richard Ormonde Shuttleworth|Richard Shuttleworth]] (1928–1934; 1936–1938),&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Desmond, ''Richard Shuttleworth: An Illustrated Biography'', Jane’s Publishing Co Ltd., 1982, Pages 187–189.&lt;/ref&gt; [[S. C. H. "Sammy" Davis]], [[Sir Malcolm Campbell]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 16 November 1931, Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birabongse Bhanudej|Prince Bira]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 16 November 1936, Page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Eyston]], [[Richard Seaman]], [[Kaye Don]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 20 November 1938, Page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]], [[Phil Hill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Wide World of Sports: Part 3 | series = Cheap Seats | series-link    = Cheap Seats (TV series) | network = ESPN Classic | date = 4 August 2004 | season = 1 | number = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Jochen Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 2 November 1953, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 72nd anniversary run took place in 1968 and was joined by celebrity participants [[Prince Rainier]] and [[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace]] of [[Monaco]], in a 1903 [[De Dion-Bouton]].&lt;ref name=Motor196811&gt;{{cite magazine | authorlink = Charles Bulmer (Ed)|title = Fun in the Sun|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|The Motor]]| volume =  3464|page=31| date = 9 November 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Stirling Moss also participated, driving a 1903 four-cylinder [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]].&lt;ref name=Motor196811 /&gt;

Some participants dress up in a late [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] or [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] style of clothing. In 1971 Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] was a passenger in a 1900 Daimler.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 25 August 1971, Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; A regular participant is [[Prince Michael of Kent]].

==RAC Brighton to London Future Car Challenge==

In 2010 the RAC launched the Brighton to London Future Car Challenge, following the same route as the veteran car run, but starting in Brighton and finishing at Regent Street, London&amp;nbsp;– and taking place of the day prior to the veteran run. The event is intended to showcase low energy impact vehicles of various technologies&amp;nbsp;– Electric, Hybrid and Low-Emission ICE (Internal Combustion Engine). Participants compete to minimise energy consumption using "road legal" vehicles in "real world" conditions.

The results of the inaugural 2010 event showed that the electric vehicles used the least energy (0.62&amp;nbsp;MJ/km on average, or 141 miles per imperial gallon petrol equivalent), compared to the hybrid vehicles (1.14&amp;nbsp;MJ/km average, 76&amp;nbsp;mpg&lt;sub&gt;imp&lt;/sub&gt; petrol equivalent) and the largely diesel powered internal combustion engine vehicles (1.68&amp;nbsp;MJ/km average, 52&amp;nbsp;mpg&lt;sub&gt;imp&lt;/sub&gt; petrol equivalent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.A.

The '''Lucha Libre World Cup''' was a two-day [[professional wrestling]] event and [[professional wrestling tournament|tournament]]  organized by Mexican [[professional wrestling promotion]] [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide]] (AAA) with the financial backing of the [[Grupo Modelo]] brewery, with Victoria Beer as the official sponsor. The tournament included a number of three-man [[tag team]]s, referred to as ''[[Six-man tag team match|trios]]'' in ''[[Lucha Libre]]'', teams and wrestling promotions already announced are AAA, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), [[Lucha Underground]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] among others. The tournament was announced as "Lucha Libre Victoria World Cup".

==Production==
===Background===
The Mexican ''[[Lucha libre]]'' [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]], with the financial support of the Mexican brewing company ''[[Grupo Modelo]]'' organized the first ever [[Lucha Libre World Cup]] over the summer of 2015. The tournament itself was a one-night eight-team tournament for trios, or [[tag teams]] of three wrestlers. AAA reached out to several promotions both in Mexico and around the world and arranged for six of the eight teams to come from outside of AAA. Japanese wrestling promotions [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]].&lt;ref name=JapaneseTeams&gt;{{cite web | url=http://superluchas.com/2015/04/23/aaa-se-anuncian-los-integrantes-de-los-grupos-ajpw-y-noah-para-la-lucha-libre-world-cup/ | title=AAA: Se anuncian los integrantes de los Grupos AJPW y Noah para la Lucha Libre World Cup | date=April 23, 2015 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 | publisher=SuperLuchas Magazine | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Total Nonstop Action]] and [[Ring of Honor]], based in the United States, also sent representatives to the tournament, in each case bolstered by representatives of [[Lucha Underground]], an AAA joint-venture project based on Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=TeamTNALU&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2015/05/04/equipo-listo-de-tna-lu-para-el-mundial-de-lucha-libre | title=Equipo listo de TNA-LU para el Mundial de Lucha Libre | date=May 4, 2015 | accessdate=May 5, 2015 | work=MedioTiempo | publisher=[[MSN]] | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament took place on May 25, 2015, and had the AAA labelled "Dream Team" of [[Rey Mysterio Jr.]], [[El Patrón Alberto]] and [[Myzteziz]] win the tournament, defeating Team TNA/Lucha Underground ([[Matt Hardy]], [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Mr. Anderson]] and [[Johnny Mundo]]) in the finals. &lt;ref name=ResultsWV2015&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wrestleview.com/misc-news/54563-aaa-lucha-libre-world-cup-results-5-24-15-live-ippv-results | title = AAA Lucha Libre World Cup Results - 5/24/15 (Live results) | last=Boutwell | first=Josh | date=May 24, 2015 | accessdate=May 24, 2015 | work=Wrestleview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===
The event will feature a yet to be announced number of [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Wrestlers and promotions from around the world already announced are [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), [[Lucha Underground]], [[Pro Wrestling Wave]] and [[Oz Academy]]. The inclusion of Wave and Oz Academy meant that female wrestlers were going to be included too as they are all-female wrestling promotions.&lt;ref name=2016Cup/&gt; On April 22, 2016, AAA made their first official press release confirming the 2016 version of the Lucha Libre World Cup. The statement confirmed that there would be two qualifying matches for the Cup during the April 29 show in [[Xalapa, Veracruz]], but did not reveal a date for the tournament nor any other participants.&lt;ref name=FirstPress&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegladiatores.com/en-xalalpa-los-perros-del-mal-chocaran-entre-si/ | title=En Xalalpa, Los Perros del Mal chocarán entre sí | date=April 22, 2016 | accessdate=April 24, 2016 | work=The Gladiatores | language=Spanish | author=[[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwiden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first qualifier was a three-way match between [[Perros del Mal]] ("The Bad Dogs") teammates [[Joe Lider]], [[Daga (wrestler)|Daga]] and [[Pentagón Jr.]], with the winner becoming part of a team representing AAA.&lt;ref name=FirstPress/&gt; The other qualifier was announced as current [[AAA Mega Championship|AAA Mega Champion]] [[El Texano Jr.]] wrestling against [[Taurus (AAA)|Taurus]] and [[Garza Jr.]]&lt;ref name=FirstPress/&gt; Of all the announced participants only Texano Jr. had participated in the previous year's Lucha Libre World Cup.&lt;ref name=ResultsWV2015/&gt; The third qualifying match for Team AAA took place during the May 14 show in [[Orizaba]], [[Veracruz]] and it was originally a three-way match between [[Psicosis|Nicho el Millonario]], [[Ricky Marvin]] and [[El Hijo del Pirata Morgan]] but later due to a request from Psycho Clown he was added to the match and eventually won.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.luchalibreaaa.com/noticias/fuego-orizaba-rumbo-vde2016/|title=Fuego en Orizaba rumbo a #VdE2016 - Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|date=2016-05-15|website=Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tournament rules ==
AAA vice president Dorian Roldán explained the rules in a video uploaded to AAA's official YouTube channel last year. The tournament would consist of trios matches structured in quarterfinals, semi-finals and a final, plus an extra match to determine the third place. The bouts are slated to have a 15-minute time limit. If the time limit is reached without a clear winner, each of the participating teams selects one member, and the two picked wrestlers face off in a 5-minute sudden death in which the winning wrestler gets the victory for his team. There will be as many sudden deaths as necessary to determine a victor.

The '''National Black Arts Festival''' was founded in 1987 after the [[Fulton County Arts Council]] (in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]) commissioned a study to explore the feasibility of creating a festival dedicated to celebrating the work of artists of African descent.  The study provided compelling reasons why the Atlanta community was the right place for such a festival.  Fulton County Government as the major sponsor, joined by additional corporate and foundation sponsors, the Festival's first biannual summer festival was held in 1988. 
 
Over the eighteen years of the festival, artists and attendees alike have come to expect the emerging and renowned artists to grace the stages and exhibition spaces of the city; collectors look eagerly to the Artists’ Market for their next opportunity to buy from some of the best artists in the country; film fans flock to the screenings of known and unknown work; concert halls are filled with the voices and instruments of those who are considered to be the standard bearers  in  jazz, gospel and everything in-between; the masters of the stage and screen have joined us over the years; and the writers who have preserved the voices of the African Diaspora in literature have blessed us with their presence.  People of all ages and races have gathered together to bask in the presence of: [[Maya Angelou]], [[Charles S. Dutton|Charles Dutton]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Nancy Wilson (singer)|Nancy Wilson]], [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], [[Spike Lee]], [[Ousmane Sembène]], [[Pearl Cleage]], [[Kenny Leon]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Radcliffe Bailey]], [[Sonia Sanchez]] and literally thousands of other artists from the USA and around the world.

As the festival firmly established itself as one of the most important festivals in the World presenting the art and culture of the [[African Diaspora]], it seized the opportunity to expand to year-round educational and humanities programming and hosting the Festival every year.  With a regular presence the festival looks forward to continuing and strengthening its important ties with its many local, national and international partners.  The Festival's success has been anchored by the willing and creative collaborations of local cultural institutions.  This year alone there are over 40 independently produced programs; without them side by side, the festival's energy and ability to reach so many–the young and old in every corner of the country–would be dramatically diminished.

And the commitment of the festival's various artistic leadership: [[Avery Brooks]], Dwight Andrews and Stephanie Hughley have allowed the breadth and reach of the festivals to touch over five million people since the first Festival.  Each artistic director brought their own ideas and energy, building on the vision of their colleagues across the [[diaspora]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">An '''organizing principle''' is a core assumption from which everything else by proximity can derive a classification or a value.  It is like a central reference point that allows all other objects to be located, often used in a [[conceptual framework]]. Having an organizing principle might help one simplify and get a handle on a particularly complicated domain or phenomenon.  On the other hand, it might create a deceptive prism that colors one's judgment.

== Examples ==

* In a [[The Brookings Institution|Brookings Institution]] article, [[James Steinberg]] describes how [[counter-terrorism]] has become the organizing principle of U.S. national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* The idea of the [[solar system]] is based on the organizing principle that the sun is located at a central point, and all planets rotate around it.
* Most modern [[cities]] are based on the organizing principle of the [[Grid plan]] in order to better manage transportation and [[Address (geography)|addressing]].
* Most religions can be described by social scientists as built around an organizing principle that allows for the sustainable or improvable [[recursion]] of a unique population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Corballis]] (June 10, 2011), "[http://www.scienceandreligiontoday.com/2011/06/10/what-is-recursion-and-how-did-it-affect-the-evolution-of-the-human-mind/ What Is Recursion and How Did It Affect the Evolution of the Human Mind?]" ''Science &amp; Religion Today''. Retrieved July 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organizations can be constructed around a set of organizing principles, such as concepts, priorities, or goals. For example, an organization may intend to be innovative, international, quality and agile.
* The central organising principle of the [[Welsh Government]] is [[sustainability]].
* [[Legitimation Code Theory]] is an explanatory framework in the [[sociology of knowledge]] and education that seeks to understand different social fields of practices in terms of their operating principles, which determines the basis of success and failure.&lt;ref&gt;Maton, K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1477">'''Rocabarra''' or '''Rocabarraigh''' is a [[phantom island]] or rock in [[Scottish Gaelic]] myth, which is supposed to appear three times, the last being at the end of the world.

:"''Nuair a thig Rocabarra ris, is dual gun tèid an Saoghal a sgrios''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://learngaelic.scot/litir/index.jsp?l=232 |title=Litir do Luchd-ionnsachaidh: An t-Eilean Ghorm (Litir 232) |last=MacIlleathain |first=Ruairidh |website=LearnGaelic |access-date=14 May 2017 }} {{link language|gd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:("When Rocabarra returns, the world will likely come to be destroyed/ruined")

The name has also been used to refer to [[Rockall]], a real rock in the [[North Atlantic]]. When [[Martin Martin]] visited [[St Kilda, Scotland|St Kilda]] in 1716, he refers to it as ''Rockoll'', but goes on to mention that the locals also knew Rockall as ''Rockabarra'' (''Rocabarraigh'').

The name has hints of a [[Old Norse|Norse]] origin, ''barraigh'' (''bar-ey'') being a common element in Scottish placenames. ''Roca'' may come from the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] language.

[[File:USMC-090128-M-4150N-0267.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] poster warns its members not to shoplift.]]
[[File:Shoplifting sign cuffs1.jpg|thumb|Notice warning shoplifters of prosecution in [[Subang Parade]], Malaysia.]]
'''Shoplifting''' (also known as '''boosting''' and '''five-finger discount''') is the unnoticed [[theft]] of goods from an open [[retail]] establishment. Shoplifting typically involves a person concealing a store item on their person, in pockets or under clothes (or in a bag, baby stroller, etc.) and leaving the store without paying for it. With clothing, shoplifters may put on items from the store and leave the store wearing the clothes. The terms "shoplifting" and "shoplifter" are not usually defined in law. The crime of shoplifting generally falls under the legal classification of [[larceny]]. Shoplifting is distinct from [[burglary]] (theft by [[breaking and entering|breaking into a closed store]]), [[robbery]] (stealing by threatening or engaging in violent behavior) or [[armed robbery]] (stealing by using a weapon). In the retail industry, the word '''[[Shrinkage (accounting)|shrinkage]]''' or '''shrink''', can be used to refer to merchandise lost by shoplifting, but the word also includes loss by other means, such as waste, uninsured damage to products, and theft by store employees.

Shoplifters range from amateurs acting on impulse, to [[career criminal]]s who habitually engage in shoplifting as a form of income. Career criminals may use several individuals to shoplift, with some participants distracting store employees while another participant steals items. Amateurs typically steal products for personal use, while career criminals generally steal items to resell them in the [[underground economy]]. Other forms of shoplifting include swapping price labels of different items, [[return fraud]] or eating a grocery store's food without paying for it. Commonly shoplifted items are those with a high price in proportion to their size, such as disposable razor blades, vitamins, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes. Retailers have reported that 0.6% of their inventory is lost to shoplifting.

Stores use a number of strategies to reduce shoplifting, including storing small, expensive items in locked glass cases; chaining or otherwise attaching items to shelves or clothes racks (particularly expensive items); attaching magnetic or radio sensors or dyepacks to items; installing curved mirrors mounted above shelves or [[CCTV|video cameras and video monitors]], hiring plainclothes "[[store detective]]s" and [[security guard]]s, and banning the bringing in of backpacks or other bags. Some stores have security guards at the exit, who search backpacks and bags and check receipts. Stores also combat shoplifting by training employees how to detect potential shoplifters.

The first documented shoplifting started to take place in 16th-century [[London]]. By the early 19th century, shoplifting was believed to be primarily a female activity. In the 1960s, shoplifting began to be redefined again, this time as a political act. Researchers divide shoplifters into two categories: "boosters", professionals who resell what they steal, and "snitches", amateurs who steal for their personal use.&lt;ref name="Cameron 1964"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Mary Owen|title=The Booster and the Snitch: Department Store Shoplifting|year=1964|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|location=Glencoe, Illinois|asin=B002NGZUJU|url=https://www.amazon.com/Booster-Snitch-Department-Store-Shoplifting/dp/B002NGZUJU/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344825464&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=booster+snitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Shoplifting is the act of knowingly taking goods from an establishment in which they are displayed for sale, without paying for them. Shoplifting usually involves concealing items on the person or an accomplice, and leaving the store without paying. However, shoplifting can also include price switching (swapping the price labels of different goods), refund fraud, "[[wardrobing]]" (returning clothes after they have been worn), and "grazing" (eating or sampling a store's goods while in the store). Price switching is now an almost extinct form of shoplifting for two reasons. Firstly, the labels will split apart upon attempted removal, and secondly, virtually all retail cashiers now scan items at the register, rather than relying on price stickers. Retailers report that shoplifting has a significant effect on their bottom line, stating that about 0.6% of all inventory disappears to shoplifters.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Generally, criminal theft involves taking possession of property illegally. In self-service shops, customers are allowed by the property owner to take physical possession of the property by holding or moving it. This leaves areas of ambiguity that could criminalize some people for simple mistakes, such as accidental putting of a small item in a pocket or forgetting to pay. For this reason penalties for shoplifting are often lower than those for general theft. Few jurisdictions have specific shoplifting legislation with which to differentiate it from other forms of theft, so reduced penalties are usually at a judge's discretion. Most retailers are aware of the serious consequences of making a [[false arrest]], and will only attempt to apprehend a person if their guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt. Depending on local laws, arrests made by anyone other than law enforcement officers may also be illegal.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Types of individuals==
===Amateurs===
Some shoplifters are [[amateur]]s who do not steal regularly from stores and who do not use shoplifting as a form of income (e.g., by reselling stolen goods). Researchers call these amateurs "snitches," as they are stealing items for their personal use.&lt;ref name="Cameron 1964"/&gt; In several countries, criminal [[flash mob]]s, primarily made up of teenagers and young adults, enter stores with the intention of stealing merchandise while accomplices distract staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leary|first=Mark|title=Why People Take Part in Violent Flash Mobs|url=http://today.duke.edu/2011/08/tip-flash-mobs|publisher=Duke University News and Communications|accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career criminals===
However, there are people and groups who make their living from shoplifting and other crimes. They tend to be more skilled [[career criminal]]s who use more sophisticated shoplifting tactics. Researchers call professional thieves "boosters," as they tend to resell what they steal &lt;ref name="Cameron 1964"/&gt; on the [[black market]].

==Legal definitions==
Shoplifting is considered a form of theft and is subject to prosecution.

==Economist perspectives==
Economists say shoplifting is common because it is a relatively unskilled crime with low entry barriers that can be fitted into a normal lifestyle. People of every [[nation]], [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]] and [[social class]] shoplift. Originally, analysis of data about apprehended shoplifters and interviews with [[store detective]]s suggested that females were almost twice as likely as males to shoplift. However, since 1980, the data suggest that males are equally or more likely to shoplift than females. The average shoplifter first did it at the age of ten: shoplifting tends to peak in [[adolescence]] then steadily declines thereafter. People of all races shoplift equally, and poor people shoplift only slightly more than rich people.&lt;ref name="levinson1508"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=edited by David|title=Encyclopedia of crime and punishment|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-0-7619-2258-2|pages=1508–1511|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z3kU3xJ2qWQC&amp;pg=PA1508&amp;lpg=PA1508&amp;dq=shoplifting+history#v=onepage&amp;q=shoplifting%20history&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men tend to shoplift using bags, and women using strollers.&lt;ref name="kietzman212"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kietzman|first=Mary Jo|title=The self-fashioning of an early modern Englishwoman: Mary Carleton's lives|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot|isbn=978-0-7546-0859-2|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shteir82"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shteir|first=Rachel|title=The steal: a cultural history of shoplifting|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-297-1|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; When caught, a shoplifter has on average $200 worth of unpaid-for merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagan|first=Frank E.|title=Crime types and criminals|year=2010|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1-4129-6479-1|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
===Concealing===
Shoplifters may conceal items in their pockets, under their clothes, in bags such as backpacks, or in a personal item they are carrying (e.g., a box) or pushing (e.g., a stroller or personal wire shopping cart) or if at a shopping center/mall, a bag from another store in that center. The use of backpacks and other bags to shoplift has led some stores to not allow people with backpacks in the store, often by asking the person to leave their backpack at a store counter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} With clothes, shoplifters may put on the store clothing underneath their own clothes and leave the store.

===Walkout/pushout===
Some shoppers fill a shopping cart with unconcealed merchandise, and walk out of the store without paying.  Security workers call this method "walkout" or "pushout".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bamfield | first = Joshua | title = Shopping and crime | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire New York, NY | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0230393554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With clothing, some shoplifters may simply put on a coat or jacket from the store and walk out wearing the item. This tactic is used because busy employees may simply not notice a person pushing a cart out without paying or walking out wearing a store-owned coat. Some "pushout" shoplifters purposefully exit quickly to avoid detection, as this gives employees less time to react.

Many stores instruct employees other than those directly involved in theft prevention or security to only confront someone verbally, so as to avoid any possibility of being held liable for injury or unwarranted detention. While this may allow stolen goods to not be recovered, the loss of revenue may be judged to be acceptable in light of the cost of a potential lawsuit or an employee being injured by a fleeing shoplifter.

== History ==

Shoplifting, originally called "lifting," is as old as shopping. The first documented shoplifting started to take place in 16th-century [[London]], and was carried out by groups of men called lifters. In 1591, [[playwright]] [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] published a [[pamphlet]] titled ''The Second Part of [[Coney-catching|Cony Catching]]'', in which he described how three men could conspire to shoplift clothes and fabric from London merchants. When it was first documented, shoplifting was characterized as an [[Criminal underworld|underworld]] practice: shoplifters were also [[con artist]]s, [[Pickpocketing|pickpockets]], [[pimp]]s, or [[Prostitution|prostitutes]].&lt;ref name="shteir16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shteir|first=Rachel|title=The steal: a cultural history of shoplifting|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-297-1|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ecenbarger|first=William|title=The High Cost of Shoplifting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IDYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=shoplifting+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J8Cqb9h50j&amp;sig=uU1aQwMwP9aCZ3mcAuNZKOA5oTw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U_InUJrIIsf7iwLukYGYDQ&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=shoplifting%20history&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 12, 2012|newspaper=The Rotarian|date=June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 17th century, London shopkeepers began to display goods in ways designed to attract shoppers, such as in window displays and glass cases. This made the goods more accessible for shoppers to handle and examine, which historians say led to an acceleration of shoplifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|title=Crime and Inequality|year=1995|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Palo Alto|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word shoplift (then, shop-lift) first appeared at the end of the 17th century in books like ''The Ladies Dictionary'', which, as well as describing shoplifting, provided tips on losing weight and styling hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Considine|first=N.H.; introduced by John|title=The ladies dictionary (1694)|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|isbn=978-0-7546-5144-4|page=579|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfQ_TquTZicC&amp;q=shoplift#v=snippet&amp;q=pretend&amp;f=false|edition=Facsimile|author2=Brown, Sylvia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Female shoplifters of this period were also called "Amazons" or "roaring girls." Notorious female shoplifters in London included [[Mary Frith]], the pickpocket and [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] also known as [[Moll Cutpurse]], prostitute and pickpocket [[Moll King]], [[Sarah McCabe]] whose shoplifting career spanned twenty years, and [[Maria Carlston]] (also known as Mary Blacke), whose life was documented by diarist [[Samuel Pepys]], who was eventually executed for theft, and who for years shoplifted clothing and household linens in London with one or more female accomplices.&lt;ref name="kietzman212"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shteir16"/&gt;

In 1699, the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] passed [[The Shoplifting Act]], part of the [[Bloody Code]] that punished petty crimes with death. People convicted of shoplifting items worth more than five [[Shilling (English coin)|shillings]] would be [[Hanging|hanged]] in London's [[Tyburn Tree]] (known as the "[[Tyburn jig]]") with crowds of thousands watching, or would be [[Penal transportation|transported]] to the [[British colonization of the Americas|North American colonies]] or to [[Botany Bay]] in Australia. Some merchants found The Shoplifting Act overly severe, jurors often deliberately under-valued the cost of items stolen so convicted shoplifters would escape death, and reformist lawyers advocated for the Act's repeal, but The Shoplifting Act was supported by powerful people such as [[Lord Ellenborough]], who characterized penal transportation as "a summer airing to a milder climate" and the [[archbishop of Canterbury]], who believed that strong punishment was necessary to prevent a dramatic increase in crime. As England began to embrace [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas about [[crime]] and [[punishment]] in the 18th century, opposition to the Bloody Code began to grow. The last English execution for shoplifting was carried out in 1822, and in 1832 the [[House of Lords]] reclassified shoplifting as a non-capital crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shteir|first=Rachel|title=The steal: a cultural history of shoplifting|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-297-1|pages=18–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 19th century, shoplifting was believed to be primarily a female activity,&lt;ref name="Segrave 2001 7"&gt;{{cite book|last=Segrave|first=Kerry|title=Shoplifting: a social history|year=2001|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-7864-0908-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doctors began to redefine some shoplifting as what [[Swiss people|Swiss]] doctor [[André Matthey]] had then newly christened "klopemania" ([[kleptomania]]), from the Greek words "''kleptein''" (stealing) and "''mania''" (insanity). Kleptomania was primarily attributed to wealthy and middle-class women, and in 1896 was criticized by [[anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]] as a way for the rich to excuse their own class from punishment, while continuing to punish the poor for the same acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shteir|first=Rachel|title=The steal: a cultural history of shoplifting|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-297-1|pages=30–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abelson|first=Elaine S.|title=When ladies go a-thieving: middle-class shoplifters in the Victorian department store|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-507142-9|page=7|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, shoplifting began to be redefined again, this time as a political act. In his 1970 book ''[[Do It: Scenarios of the Revolution]]'', American activist [[Jerry Rubin]] wrote "All money represents theft...shoplifting gets you high. Don't buy. Steal," and in ''[[The Anarchist Cookbook]]'', published in 1971, American author William Powell offered tips for how to shoplift. In his 1971 book ''[[Steal This Book]]'', American activist [[Abbie Hoffman]] offered tips on how to shoplift and argued that shoplifting is anti-corporate. In her book ''The Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting'', social historian [[Rachel Shteir]] described how shoplifting from companies you dislike is considered by some activist groups, such as some [[Freeganism|freegans]], decentralized anarchist collective [[CrimethInc]], the Spanish anarchist collective [[Yomango]] and the Canadian magazine [[Adbusters]], to be a morally defensible act of corporate sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurshan|first=Jerry Rubin; introduction by Eldridge Cleaver; designed by Quentin Fiore; yipped by Jim Retherford; zapped by Nancy|title=Do it: Scenarios of the Revolution|year=1970|publisher=Ballantine books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-20601-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yasoAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=do+it+scenarios&amp;dq=do+it+scenarios}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bergman|first=William Powell.

== Motivations ==

Researchers divide shoplifters into two categories: "boosters," professionals who resell what they steal, and "snitches," amateurs who steal items for their personal use.&lt;ref name="Cameron 1964"/&gt; [[Motivation]]s for shoplifting are controversial among researchers, although they generally agree that shoplifters are driven by either [[Personal finance|economic]] or [[psychosocial]] motives. Psychosocial motivations may include [[peer pressure]], a desire for thrill or excitement, impulse, stealing because judgment is clouded by [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], or doing so because of a [[compulsive behavior|compulsion]].&lt;ref name="levinson1508"/&gt; Depression is the psychiatric disorder most commonly associated with shoplifting. Shoplifting is also associated with family or marital stress, social isolation, having had a difficult childhood, alcoholism or drug use, low self-esteem, and [[eating disorder]]s, with bulimic shoplifters frequently stealing food. Some researchers have theorized that shoplifting is an unconscious attempt to make up for a past loss.&lt;ref name="shopliftingprevention1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychological Studies on Shoplifting and Kleptomania|url=http://www.shopliftingprevention.org/whatnaspoffers/nrc/psychologicalstudies.htm|publisher=National Association for Shoplifting Prevention: Psychological Studies on Shoplifting and Kleptomania|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have found that the decision to shoplift is associated with pro-shoplifting attitudes, social factors, opportunities for shoplifting and the perception that the shoplifter is unlikely to be caught. Researchers say that shoplifters justify their shoplifting through a variety of personal narratives, such as believing they are making up for having been victimized, that they are unfairly being denied things they deserve, or that the retailers they steal from are untrustworthy or immoral.&lt;ref name="shopliftingprevention1"/&gt; Sociologists call these narratives [[Neutralisation (sociology)|neutralizations]], meaning mechanisms people use to silence values within themselves that would otherwise prevent them from carrying out a particular act.

A 1984 program in West Texas designed to reduce [[recidivism]] (repeat offenses) among convicted adult shoplifters identified eight common beliefs of shoplifters:
* If I am careful and smart, I will not get caught.
* Even if I do get caught, I will not be turned in and prosecuted.
* Even if I am prosecuted, the punishment will not be severe.
* The merchants deserve what they get.
* Everybody, at some time or another, has shoplifted; therefore it’s OK for me to do.
* Shoplifting is not a major crime.
* I must have the item I want to shoplift or if I want it, I should have it.
* It is okay to shoplift because the merchants expect it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solomon |first=Gary S. |author2=Dr. Joseph B.

[[Developmental psychology|Developmental psychologists]] believe that children under the age of nine shoplift to test boundaries, and that tweens and teenagers shoplift mainly for excitement or the thrill, are "acting out" or depressed, or are being pressured by their peers.&lt;ref name="shteir82"/&gt;

== Differences by geography ==

Researches say that around the world, in countries including the United States, [[Canada]], Australia, [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], South Africa, Japan and India, people tend to shoplift the same types of items, and frequently even the same brands.&lt;ref name="bamfield84"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bamfield|first=Joshua A. N. (Centre for Retail Research)|title=Shopping and crime (Crime Prevention and Security Management)|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-230-52160-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But there are also differences in shoplifting among different countries that reflect those countries' general consumption habits and preferences. In [[Milan]], [[saffron]], an expensive component of [[risotto|risotto alla Milanese]], is frequently shoplifted, and throughout [[Italy]], [[parmigiano reggiano]] is often stolen from supermarkets. In Spain, [[jamón ibérico]] is a frequent target. In France, the anise-flavoured liqueur [[Ricard Pastis|ricard]] is frequently stolen, and in Japan, experts believe that [[manga comics]], [[electronic games]] and [[whisky]] are most frequently stolen. Bookstores and magazine sellers in Japan have also complained about what they call "digital shoplifting," which refers to the photographing of material in-store for later reading. Packed cheese has been the most frequently shoplifted item in [[Norway]], with thieves selling it afterwards to pizza parlours and fast food restaurants.&lt;ref name="bamfield84"/&gt;

== Economic impact and response from shops ==
Retailers report that shoplifting has a significant effect on their bottom line, stating that about 0.6% of all inventory disappears to shoplifters.  According to the 2012 National Retail Security Survey, shoplifting costs American retailers approximately $14B annually.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714203225/http://soccrim.clas.ufl.edu/2014/02/20/2012-national-retail-security-survey-has-been-released/ 2012 National Retail Security Survey]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, it was claimed that shoplifting cost US retailers $25 million a day. Observers believe that industry shoplifting numbers are over half employee theft or fraud and the rest by patrons.  Of course, if apprehended during the shoplifting the merchandise is generally recovered by the retailers and there is often no loss to the store owner when the merchandise is surrendered to the store by the suspects. In addition, in many states retailers have the right to recover civil damages to cover the cost of providing security.

According to a December 23, 2008, article in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', Dimperio's Market, the only full-service grocery store in the [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], closed because of shoplifters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08358/937017-85.stm Thieves cause Hazelwood grocery to give up], Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
{{Main|Shopkeeper's privilege}}
{{Globalize|section|date=August 2008}}
Shoplifting is considered a form of theft  and is subject to prosecution.

=== United States ===

In most cases in the United States, store employees and managers have certain powers of arrest. Store officials may detain for investigation (for a reasonable length of time), the person who they have probable cause to believe is attempting to take or has unlawfully taken merchandise (see [[shopkeeper's privilege]]). Store employees may also have [[citizen's arrest]] powers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizen's Arrest Laws by State|url=http://solutions-institute.org/tools/citizens-arrest-laws-by-state/|website=Solutions Institute|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but absent a statute granting broader authority a citizen's arrest power is normally available only for felony offenses, while shoplifting is usually a misdemeanor offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waltz|first1=John R.|title=Shoplifting and the Law of Arrest: The Merchant's Dilemma|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=1952|volume=62|issue=5|page=788|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ylr62&amp;div=51&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=12 September 2017|doi=10.2307/793505|jstor=793505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, store employees who detain suspects outside of and inside the store premises are generally granted limited powers of arrest by state law, and have the power to initiate criminal arrests or civil sanctions, or both, depending upon the policy of the retailer and the state statutes governing [[Civil recovery|civil demands and civil recovery]] for shoplifting as reconciled with the criminal laws of the jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Shoplifting Laws and Punishments|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal-law/shoplifting-laws-and-punishments|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.org/shoplift.html |title=Tennessee Law, DAG, 7th JD: Shoplifting Section 39-14-144 |date=February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018024924/http://www.attorneygeneral.org/shoplift.html |archivedate=October 18, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., subsection (f)(1) of the {{cite web|title=California Penal Code, Sec. 490.5.|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=490.5.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=California State Legislature|accessdate=12 September 2017}} (Permitting a retail employee to detain a suspected shoplifter for a reasonable amount of time.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, an offence involving shoplifting may be charged under Section 1 of the Theft Act 1986; alternatively, if the goods stolen are worth less than £200, a person may be charged under Section 176 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act. Upon conviction, the maximum penalty is a fine or up to six months in prison if the goods stolen are worth less than £200; if they are worth more than £200, the maximum penalty is seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.inbrief.co.uk/offences/shoplifting/ | title=Shoplifting: What happens if you are caught?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle East ===

In the Islamic legal system called [[Sharia]], "[[hudud]]" (meaning limits or restrictions) calls for "[[Sariqa]]" (theft) to be punished by [[amputation]] of the thief's hand. This punishment is categorized as "[[hadd]]," meaning a punishment that restrains or prevents further crime. Sariqa is interpreted differently in different countries and by different scholars, and some say it does not include shoplifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jandt|first=Fred E.|title=An introduction to intercultural communication: identities in a global community|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=978-1-4129-9287-9|page=231|edition=7th|date=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haroon|first=Muhammad|title=Islam and Punishment|publisher=Vision Islamic Publications|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abdullah|first=Mohammed|title=Lashing, stoning, mutilating: Islamic law is barbaric and outdated.

== Prevention ==

Shoplifting may be prevented and detected. [[Closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) monitoring is an important anti-shoplifting technology. [[Electronic article surveillance]] (EAS) is another method of inventory protection. [[Radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) is an anti-employee-theft and anti-shoplifting technology used in retailers such as [[Walmart]], which already heavily use RFID technology for inventory purposes. [[Loss prevention]] personnel can consist of both uniformed officers and plain-clothed store detectives.  Large department stores will use both and smaller stores will use one or the other depending on their shrink strategy. Store detectives will patrol the store acting as if they are real shoppers.

The presence of uniformed officers acts as a deterrent to shoplifting activity and they are mostly used by high-end retail establishments. Shoppers in some stores are asked when leaving the premises to have their purchases checked against the [[receipt]]. Some expensive merchandise will be in a locked case requiring an employee to get items at a customer's request.  The customer is either required to purchase the merchandise immediately or it is left at the checkout area for the customer to purchase when finishing shopping. Many stores also lock CDs, DVDs, and video games in locking cases, which can only be opened by the checkout operator once the item has gone through the checkout. Some stores will use dummy cases, also known as "dead boxes", where the box or case on the shelf is entirely empty and the customer will not be given the item they have paid for until the transaction has been completed, usually by other store staff.

Security guards are generally given the following criteria that must be met before apprehending a shoplifting suspect:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=False Arrest, Shoplifting, security consultant, Chris McGoey, shoplifting, false arrest, security expert |url=http://www.crimedoctor.com/shoplifting3.htm |website=www.crimedoctor.com |accessdate=2015-05-23 |first=Chris |last=McGoey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302032924/http://www.crimedoctor.com/shoplifting3.htm |archivedate=March 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*You must see the shoplifter approach the merchandise; select the merchandise; and conceal, convert or carry away the merchandise.
*You must maintain continuous observation of the shoplifter
*You must observe the shoplifter leave the store and fail to pay for the merchandise
*You must apprehend the shoplifter outside the store

Many stores will put up signs warning about the consequences of shoplifting or signs warning about the use of surveillance cameras in the store. This is intended to deter people from trying to shoplift.

=== Closed-circuit television ===
[[File:US Army 51805 Post, AAFES combat increases in juvenile shoplifting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A security guard watches a store's [[CCTV]] cameras.]]
[[Closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) monitoring is an important anti-shoplifting technology.  Retailers focusing on loss prevention often devote most of their resources to this technology. Using CCTVs to apprehend shoplifters in the act requires full-time human monitoring of the cameras.
Sophisticated CCTV systems discriminate the scenes to detect and segregate suspicious behaviour from numerous screens and to enable automatic alerting. However, the attentiveness of the surveillance personnel may be threatened by false reliance on automatics.
CCTV is more effective if used in conjunction with [[electronic article surveillance]] (EAS) systems. The EAS system will warn of a potential shoplifter and the video may provide evidence for prosecution if the shoplifter is allowed to pass checkout points or leave store premises with unbought merchandise.

Many stores will use public-view monitors in the store to show people there that they are being recorded. This is intended as a deterrent to shoplifting. Some stores use inexpensive dummy cameras. Even though these fake cameras cannot record images, their presence may deter shoplifting.

=== Electronic article surveillance ===

[[Electronic article surveillance]] (EAS) are magnetic or radio-frequency tags that sound an alarm if a shoplifter leaves a store with store items that have not been paid for. EAS methods are second only to CCTV in popularity amongst retailers looking for inventory protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tititudorancea.net/z/shoplifting.htm|title=Shoplifting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EAS refers to the electronic security tags that are attached to merchandise and cause an alarm to sound on exiting the store. Some stores also have detection systems at the entrance to the bathrooms that sound an alarm if someone tries to take unpaid merchandise with them into the bathroom. Regularly, even when an alarm does sound, a shoplifter walks out casually and is not confronted if no guards are present because of the high number of false alarms, especially in malls, due to "tag pollution" whereby non-deactivated tags from other stores set off the alarm. This can be overcome with newer systems and a properly trained staff. Some new systems either do not alarm from "tag pollution" or they produce a specific alarm when a customer enters the store with a non-deactivated tag so that store personnel can remove or deactivate it so it does not produce a false alarm when exiting the store. However, with tags [[spider wrap]] may be used instead of tags.
[[File:RFID and magneto-acoustic tags.JPG|thumb|right|Electronic article [[surveillance]] tags: [[Electronic_article_surveillance#Acousto-magnetic systems|acousto-magnetic]] (top) and [[Electronic_article_surveillance#Radio_frequency systems|RF]] (bottom).]]

Some tags are stuck onto merchandise with glue (rather than being superimposed on) the shoplifter can easily scrape off the tag in their pocket. Pedestal EAS covers, which are made of durable vinyl, offer cost-effective means of adding a marketing tool at every entrance to a store; they are also custom-manufactured to fit any pedestal and can be printed to highlight specific brands or seasonal promotions. They do not interfere with the performance of the EAS systems and are easily cleaned or changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti Shop Lifting|url=http://aflak.com.sa/newweb/html/eng/anti-shop-lifting.html|accessdate=3 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202192439/http://aflak.com.sa/newweb/html/eng/anti-shop-lifting.html|archivedate=December 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some shoplifters may employ [[Radio jamming|jammer]] devices to prevent EAS tags from triggering, or magnets to remove the tags. Stores may employ technology to detect jammers and magnets.

[[Radio-frequency identification]] (RFID) is an anti-employee-theft and anti-shoplifting technology used in retailers such as [[Walmart]], which already heavily use RFID technology for inventory purposes. If a product with an active RFID tag passes the exit scanners at a Walmart outlet, not only does it set off an alarm, but it also tells security personnel exactly what product to look for in the shopper's cart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seekingalpha.com/article/194466-rfid-technology-transforming-food-retailers-like-wal-mart] RFID and Walmart&lt;/ref&gt;

Add-on [[metal detector]] systems will be used in some stores with [[electronic article surveillance]] which sense metallic surfaces. They are used to deter the use of [[booster bag]]s which are used to shield EAS tags.

=== Staff roles===
[[File:Day 170 - Dudley Retail radio (9091713875).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A British store owner using a two-way radio to remain in contact with police, an approach that law enforcement officers hope will reduce shoplifting.]]
[[Store detective]]s patrol the store wearing plainclothes and acting as if they are real shoppers.  They may browse, examine, carry or even try on merchandise, all the while looking for signs of shoplifting and looking for possible shoplifters. Many large retail companies use this technique. Store detectives will watch a shoplifting suspect conceal an item, then stop them after they have exited the store. These types of personnel must follow a strict set of rules because of very high liability risks. Many big retail or grocery stores like [[Walmart]], [[Rite Aid]], [[Zellers]], [[Loblaws]], etc. have a store detective to watch for shoplifters. Most of these stores use secret verbal codes over the [[PA system]] to alert management, other loss prevention personal and associates that there is a shoplifter. Store detectives must follow a suspect around the store by foot or by watching video monitors and observe every move the person makes so that they do not face a lawsuit for apprehending or arresting the wrong person.

The presence of uniformed [[security guard]]s acts as a deterrent to shoplifting activity and they are mostly used by high-end retail establishments such as jewellery stores and camera and electronics stores. They are also used in stores like [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Walmart]]. Floor attendants greet customers, follow them as they walk about the store, and offer help with shopping. Shoplifters are not comfortable with this attention and may go somewhere else where they can steal unnoticed. In a 2008 global study conducted by NRMA, it found shoplifters are 68 percent less likely to commit the offence if they are greeted immediately as they walk into the retail store.

Some stores, such as [[Target Corporation|Target]], will have an employee working at the fitting rooms. The employee will count how many clothes a person brings into the fitting rooms and ensure that they come out with the same number of clothes. This is to prevent people from using the fitting rooms to shoplift. The strategies used by store and security personnel can strongly affect the ability of shoplifters to succeed.  All personnel must be trained in the techniques shoplifters use to steal merchandise and the proper actions to take to detect these thefts.

=== Exit inspections ===
Shoppers in some stores are asked when leaving the premises to have their purchases checked against the [[receipt]]. [[Costco]] and [[Best Buy]] are well-known companies that employ this tactic. However, this is voluntary, as the store cannot legally detain the shopper unless they have [[probable cause]] to suspect the shopper of shoplifting.

In the United States, shoppers are under no actual obligation to accede to such a search unless the employee has reasonable grounds to suspect shoplifting, and arrests the customer or takes or looks at the receipt from the customer without violating any laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lps1.com/bw.digg.html |title=Black &amp; White, Birmingham's City Paper |publisher=Lps1.com |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220050637/http://www.lps1.com/bw.digg.html |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.die.net/musings/bestbuy/ |title=Best Buy Receipt Check |publisher=die.net |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if the customer has signed a membership agreement which stipulates that customers will subject themselves to inspections before taking the purchased merchandise from the store. In the cases of [[Sam's Club]] and [[Costco]], the contracts merely say that it is their policy to check receipts at the exit or that they "reserve the right". That wording does not specify the results of non-compliance by the customer, and since they did not have a right to re-check receipts in the first place, it may not be legally binding at all. The purchaser who holds the receipt owns the merchandise. Employees who harass, assault, touch, or detain customers or take their purchased merchandise may be committing torts or crimes against the customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartmoney.com/spending/rip-offs/10-things-your-warehouse-club-won-t-tell-you/?page=2 |title=10 Things Warehouse Clubs Won't Tell You |publisher=SmartMoney.com |date=September 4, 2009 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bottom-of-basket mirrors are commonly used in grocery stores where the checkout lanes are close together and the cashier might be unable to see the entire basket to ensure payment of all items.

=== Display cases ===
[[File:New Nintendo 3DS Display Case PAX Australia 2014.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Nintendo 3DS]] video game consoles in a locked display case.]]
Some expensive merchandise will be in a locked case requiring an employee to get items at a customer's request.  The customer is either required to purchase the merchandise immediately or it is left at the checkout register (under the supervision of a cashier) for the customer to purchase when finished shopping.  This prevents the customer from having a chance to conceal the item. Another way of locking merchandise, especially popular in liquor stores, is to place it in a secure, store-administered hard-plastic cap on a regular bottle top. Once purchased the clerk will remove the cap with a store key. It is not otherwise easily removable. Many stores also lock CDs, DVDs, and video games in locking cases, which can only be opened by the checkout operator once the item has gone through the checkout. Many stores have certain items on locking pegs which are secure hooks to where the item cannot be removed from the hook.

Some stores will use dummy cases, also known as "dead boxes", where the box or case on the shelf is entirely empty and the customer will not be given the item they have paid for until the transaction has been completed, usually by other store staff. Some stores have been known to take this idea further by filling the dummy cases or boxes with a weight, similar to the weight of the actual item by using a weight  made to fit inside the box. This causes the shoplifter to think that the box is full, trying to steal it and ending up with nothing. This was especially popular in movie rental stores such as Blockbuster Video.

===Retail bag check exit policy===
A '''retail bag check exit policy''' is a form policy or management procedure or set of standard guidelines or rules for customers/consumer set in place by a store owner or manager or owner of the store. In some retail stores such as [[JB Hi-Fi]], customers are (randomly) asked, instructed, or requested or subject to present their personal bags for inspection by a staff or security guard or loss prevention associate when leaving the store on condition of entry.

Additionally, some stores such as [[JB Hi-Fi]], [[BestBuy]] and [[Costco]] add a measure and process of conducting receipt inspection to make sure the customer is purchasing the correct item. There is another theft scheme, in which people can conceal items and then only pay for one item. Normally this is either done by customers or employees. Loss prevention/security guards would normally only ask for a bag check. The purpose is to reduce and decrease retail theft and shoplifting.

== Notable cases ==

In 1897, accused murderer [[Lizzie Borden]] again received media attention when she was accused of shoplifting.

In 1937, French writer and political activist [[Jean Genet]] was arrested in Paris for shoplifting a dozen handkerchiefs from the [[department store]] [[Samaritaine]]. Genet frequently stole from shops throughout his life, including alcohol, bolts of linen, books and suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Shteir| first= Rachel|title=The steal: a cultural history of shoplifting| year= 2011| publisher= Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-297-1|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Hedy Lamarr]] was arrested for shoplifting in [[Los Angeles]]. The charges were eventually dropped. In 1991, she was arrested on the same charge in [[Florida]], this time for $21.48 worth of laxatives and eye drops. She pleaded "no contest" to avoid a court appearance, and in return for a promise to refrain from breaking any laws for a year, the charges were once again dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Salamone, Debbie (24 October 1991). "Hedy Lamarr Won't Face Theft Charges If She Stays In Line". Orlando Sentinel; retrieved 10 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Lady Isobel Barnett]], British radio and television personality, was found guilty of shoplifting and committed suicide four days later.

In 2001, actress [[Winona Ryder]] was arrested for shoplifting at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] department store in [[Beverly Hills, California]].  Ryder was eventually convicted of misdemeanor theft and vandalism and became eligible for expungement of the conviction after finishing probation in 2005.  Ryder was originally convicted by a jury of felony larceny/vandalism and was sentenced in a nationally televised California Superior Court proceeding in December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/3821355.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ryder shoplifting charge reduced | date=June 19, 2004 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, former New York City Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s daughter Caroline was arrested for stealing five beauty items worth about $100 from a [[Sephora]] store in [[Manhattan]]. She was later offered a dismissal in return for a day of community service and six months without a further offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/04/politics/main6744578.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Rudy Giuliani's Daughter Arrested in NYC | date=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peltz |first=Jennifer |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38939870/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ |title=Caroline Giuliani's case set for dismissal in NYC |publisher=MSNBC |date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British chef and TV host [[Antony Worrall Thompson]] was arrested for shoplifting "...three onions and two pots of...coleslaw from a branch of Tesco" and "...received a caution" from authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/9005012/So-what-drives-a-celebrity-to-steal.html | title=So what drives a celebrity to steal?| date=2012-01-11| last1=Gordon| first1=Bryony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Soldiers: An Obituary for Geneva''''' (Soldaten. Nekrolog auf Genf) is a 1967 play about [[Winston Churchill]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/2761/Soldiers Playbill from original New York production] accessed 16 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; controversial for alleging that he was involved in the death of the Polish Prime Minister, General [[Władysław Sikorski]], in an [[1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash|airplane crash in 1943]].

German writer [[Rolf Hochhuth]] wrote the play on occasion of the 100th anniversary of the [[First Geneva Convention]], alleging that Churchill condoned the murder of Sikorski in order to appease Stalin, and also highlighting Churchill's support for the mass bombing of German cities in 1943.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The play was meant to premiere at Britain's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in 1967, but this was cancelled and the play was produced instead in the West End with [[John Colicos]] as Churchill.

Hochhuth, unaware that the plane's pilot [[Eduard Prchal]] was still alive, accused him of participating in the plot. Prchal won a libel case that seriously affected the London theatre which staged the play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2004/04/001-the-end-of-the-pius-wars "''The End of the Pius Wars''"], [[Joseph Bottum (author)|Joseph Bottum]], [[First Things]] Magazine, April 2004, retrieved 1 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Hochhuth never paid the 50,000 British pounds imposed on him by the court and subsequently avoided returning to the UK.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.zeit.de/2016/29/rolf-hochhuth-stoerenfried-sachbuch-birgit-lahann|title = Rolf Hochhuth: Immobilien-Wessi|last = Naumann|first = Michael|date = 2016-07-23|work =|newspaper = Die Zeit|language = German|issn = 0044-2070|author-link = Michael Naumann|access-date = 2016-07-24|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, he revealed his source for Churchill's involvement as Jane Ledig-Rowohlt, the British wife of his publisher [[Heinrich Maria Ledig-Rowohlt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.moz.de/artikel-ansicht/dg/0/1/293866|title = Hochhuth benennt Zeugen für Mord an Sikorski|last =|first =|date = 2011-04-28|website =|publisher = Märkische Oderzeitung / dpa|language = German|access-date = 2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (née Jane Scatcherd). According to Hochhuth's biographer Birgit Lahan, these rumours relayed by Jane Ledig-Rowohlt had been the sole source for the allegations in the play.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The play was profiled in the [[William Goldman]] book ''[[The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway]]''.

The Supreme Court reversed the case for further trial after finding that expert testimony regarding the defence's submission, that Kelly suffered from [[Battered woman defence|battered woman syndrome]], was incorrectly excluded since battered woman syndrome was a proper subject for expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audiocasefiles.com/cases/detail/case/8764/ ''State v.

==Implications==
This is a notable case, both regarding the role of experts in new fields and in trials where the [[battered woman defense]] may be advanced, as is demonstrated by it being cited in other states,&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;[http://www.state.wv.us/wvsca/DVBenbook/OStateCases/OstateKelly.pdf Full text here] "STATE of New Jersey, Plaintiff-Respondent v.

The '''Sydney Eisteddfod''' is an independent community based not-for-profit organisation limited by guarantee a registered charity &lt;ref&gt;https://www.acnc.gov.au/ACNC/FindCharity/QuickSearch/ACNC/OnlineProcessors/Online_register/Search_the_Register.aspx?noleft=1 &lt;/ref&gt; in Sydney, Australia, and listed on the federal Register of Cultural Organisations&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gov.au/funding-support/tax-incentives/register-cultural-organisations Australian Government – Register of Cultural Organisations]&lt;/ref&gt; eligible to receive tax-deductible donations.  Directors and advisors are honorary. Sydney [[Eisteddfod]] annually presents a competitive festival with the help of arts and education professionals.  The Festival involves events for singers, dancers, actors, musicians, choirs, bands and orchestras, along with creative categories for composers, writers and poets.

The Sydney Eisteddfod formerly known as the City of Sydney Eisteddfod opened in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4273546 The Sydney Eisteddfod Story: 1933–1941 by Jennie Rowley Lees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17008201#pstart1149219]&lt;/ref&gt; held from 9 to 26 August 1933 in the Sydney Town Hall, The Assembly Halls, The Railway Institute Halls and Paling's concert Hall. The illustrated souvenir programme cost one shilling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicaustralia.org/apps/MA?function=showDetail&amp;currentBibRecord=000011362005&amp;itemSeq=6&amp;total=13&amp;returnFunction=searchResults&amp;term1=City+of+Sydney+Eisteddfod.&amp;location1=Anywhere&amp;scope=scope&amp;parameter1=phrase&amp;boolean1=and&amp;sessionId=reuseSearch6C8B713D81E2F53EB81F4E2B7E20DD4B1314254818662&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sydney Eisteddfod  acts as a reference source for public enquiries about other competitions and opportunities, arts organisations and supports groups, performances presented by commercial and non-profit presenters; encourages opportunities for public performance by developing artists; promoting recitals, concerts and performances; nurtures interest in the performing and creative arts, and cultivates future audiences.

Sydney Eisteddfod won the City of Sydney Business Award, Cultural and Creative Services section in 2011 &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.sydneymedia.com.au/4717-all-the-worlds-a-stage-for-business-awards-winner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the opening of [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] in 1932, some people believed that the city needed to cultivate a more sophisticated image.{{fact|date=December 2013}}  At the time Sydney had no [[Opera House]] or symphony orchestra and one of its three live theatres was already marked for demolition, members of the Citizens of Sydney Organising Committee consulted leaders of the local musical community and devised plans for a great [[eisteddfod]] to enhance Sydney's reputation as a centre for arts.

The NSW State Conservatorium and President of the NSW Music Week Committee drew up a proposal to hold a large-scale event to bring together the best musical and elocutionary talent of the various States.  On 22 December, this was adopted at a meeting at the Sydney Town Hall under the chairmanship of the [[List of Mayors and Lord Mayors of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] Samuel Walder MLC.

In the [[1933 New Year Honours]], Walder received a knighthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16947756?searchTerm=WALDER|title=Sir Samuel Walder|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 January 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; He relinquished his mayoral duties, but continued his career in State politics, retained his place on the Citizens of Sydney Organising Committee and continued to support the Eisteddfod.

The First City of Sydney Eisteddfod offered a programme of 84 vocal, choral, speech and musical events and drew 5,410 entries.  It opened to great success on 19 August 1933 with artist including [[Joan Hammond]], [[Ernest Llewellyn]] and Joy Nichols.

Apart from a four-year recess&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17783935?searchTerm=citizens%20of%20sydney%20eisteddfod&amp;searchLimits=\\Morning Four Year Recess The Sydney Morning Herald Friday, 16 January 1942&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56431316?searchTerm=citizens%20of%20sydney%20eisteddfod&amp;searchLimits Sydney Eisteddfod resumes Morning Bulletin Rockhampton 16 January 1946&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Pacific War]] the competition has continued ever since.  The Citizens Committee disbanded in 1950, but the Eisteddfod continued with the same mix of political, civic, educational and industry leadership.  The City of Sydney Cultural Council was incorporated in 1975 to embrace a wider range of activities.

[[McDonald's]] Australia commenced its association with Sydney Eisteddfod (formerly known as Sydney cultural Council) in 1988 with naming rights sponsorship.
McDonald's Australia have also supported the McDonald's Operatic Aria since 1989 and the McDonald's Ballet Scholarship since 1998 providing the necessary [[nutrient]] for encouraging and developing artistic talent across Australia.

==Boycotts==
'''RINJ''' women campaign vigorously to encourage members and the public at large to boycott entities RINJ says promote misogyny and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwell|first1=Philip|title=Facebook Refuses to shut Rape Page run by Schoolboy|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/facebook-refuses-to-shut-rape-page-run-by-schoolboy-20111017-1lsde.html#ixzz1b3QfabUj|accessdate=24 February 2017|work=The Age (Australia)|issue=October 17, 2011|publisher=The Age|date=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boycotts include''' the February 2017 response to song [[I Decided (album)|'No Favors' on "I Decided" Rap Album]] by "[[Eminem|Slim Shady]]" (Marshall Bruce Mathers (a.k.a. [[Eminem]])) and Sean Michael Anderson ([[Big Sean]]) whom RINJ calls "rape rappers".

'''Among other boycotted [[misogyny]]/[[rape]] promoting "offenders"''' identified by RINJ were Facebook advertisers allegedly running advertisements on Facebook pages promoting rape ([[Criticism of Facebook#Rape pages|"rape pages"]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwell|first1=Philip|title=Cyber anarchists blamed for unleashing a series of Facebook 'rape pages'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8829165/Cyber-anarchists-blamed-for-unleashing-a-series-of-Facebook-rape-pages.html|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; RINJ joined forces with other organizations like "Women's Views on News" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osmond|first1=Jane|title=Victory: Facebook rape page is – finally – taken down|url=http://www.womensviewsonnews.org/2011/11/victory-facebook-rape-page-is-finally-taken-down/|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=Nov 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to organize boycotts of Facebook advertisers that ran advertisements on [[Facebook]] [[Criticism of Facebook#Rape pages|rape pages]].

'''The RINJ Foundation women urged boycotts of  broadcasters''' like [[Kyle Sandilands]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RINJ vs Kyle Sandilands|url=http://torrentsofscorn.blogspot.ca/2011/12/rinj-vs-kyle-sandilands.html|website=Torrents of Scorn|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia who reportedly attacked a female journalist making rude remarks about her breasts and threatening to "hunt her down". RINJ also went after [[Bill Cosby]] and sought a boycott of his shows in Canada protesting outdoors in January 2015 with "Rape Is No Joke" signs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protesters shout at fans as Bill Cosby hits the stage|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/protesters-shout-at-fans-as-bill-cosby-hits-the-stage/|agency=Associated Press|publisher=CBS News|date=January 7, 2017|ref=Rape Is No Joke}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a plethora of [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|rape allegations against Cosby]] became public in 2014.

==Safety of Migrant Female Household Workers==

'''Trixolan''' ('''TX''') is a purportedly therapeutic agent based on [[Viroxan]], a [[citronella oil|citronella]]-based substance used by Stephen Herman, a Californian doctor who used it to treat AIDS patients. State medical officials stated that the drug hastened the deaths of at least two AIDS patients.
Herman surrendered his medical license in 1991 when prosecutors agreed they would, in return, drop civil charges of gross negligence, incompetence, dishonesty and other offenses.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;[http://www.aegis.org/news/lt/1995/LT950703.html AEGiS-LT: (LAT) Nixon's Nephew Explains Visit to Vesco in Cuba; Donald Nixon Jr. says that before his house arrest he was working through the fugitive financier on a 'miracle drug' to treat AIDS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, in the first AIDS [[Quackery|medical fraud]] case to come to trial in the United States, a Los Angeles County jury ordered two doctors and a hospital that used Viroxan to pay five patients a total of $2.7 million. Herman had been dropped from the suit when he declared bankruptcy.

Trixolan was linked in headlines to American fugitive [[Robert Vesco|Robert Lee Vesco]] and to [[Donald A. Nixon]], President Richard Nixon's nephew.
In the early 1980s Donald Nixon's wife contracted breast cancer and was treated with chemotherapy. In the search for a remedy for her cancer, he met with Dr. Stephen Herman, who claimed that Viroxan could boost the immune system and could get rid of many diseases, including cancer. Donald Nixon gave his wife Trixolan and claimed that it cured his wife's cancer and her arthritis.&lt;ref name = LATimes/&gt;

Nixon asked the Federal Government for $300 million to test the drug. When no funding was forthcoming, he formed a partnership with Vesco and other partners. Nixon was placed under house arrest in Cuba when he went to visit Vesco&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; who had fled to Cuba to avoid prosecution for securities fraud&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; for financing.&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt;

Purportedly, Vesco introduced Nixon to Fidel Castro and his brother Raul, and Fidel set up four laboratories in Cuba with his nephew Antonio Fraga Castro as head of the project to develop the formula. They claim Trixolan suppresses cancer and cures AIDS, arthritis and the common cold - all of which are diseases related to immunity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=la+vida+y+muerte+de+robert+vesco&amp;sitesearch= la vida y muerte de robert vesco - Google Video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

'''Uri Gil''' (born April 9, 1943) is a retired [[brigadier general]] in the [[Israeli Air Force]]. In 2007, he was listed as the most senior combat pilot in history in the [[Guinness World Records]].

==Biography==
Gil was born in [[Givat Haim|Kibbutz Givat Haim]], the third of four sons. When he was a boy, Gil thought about becoming a composer because he liked to go to clubs to listen to records. He has said that he never wanted to be a pilot, but rather in an "elite paratrooper unit". Gil stated that he "was forced to go to the tests for the pilot course, which are like a game, so I played along and I was accepted against my will". He had no intention of staying on in regular service,  but did so because "we were taught to bear the burden". Gil flew fighter jets, and flew missions in the [[Six-Day War]], the [[War of Attrition]] and the [[Yom Kippur War]]. Gil eventually became a Squadron Commander (253 Squadron), and retired from regular duty in 1985, but still kept flying for another 18 years until he was 60 years old. Gil's last flight was on June 20, 2003. Gil has set the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for being the longest-flying fighter pilot.&lt;ref name=urigil&gt;{{cite web|author=Neri Livneh|title=Uri Gil: A pilot, a record-breaker, a painter|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/uri-gil-a-pilot-a-record-breaker-a-painter-1.425320|publisher=Haaretz|date=April 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Israeli Airman Attains New Heights in Painting," Michelle Fram Cohen, ''Navigator Review of Politics and Culture'', May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==
In 2008, Gil was featured in an Israel [[Documentary film|documentary]] titled ''The Best Pilot in the World''. The film was directed by Dr. Amir Har-Gil. In the film, Gil talks about his over 41 years of service in the Israeli Air Force, and the many enemy planes he shot down. Gil stated in the film that he was the only pilot who had downed planes in all the wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Documentaries, Israel/Palestine - The Best Pilot in the World|url=http://www.journeyman.tv/59101/documentaries/the-best-pilot-in-the-world.html|publisher=Journeyman Pictures|quote=''Flight is a serious vocation, it takes up all of you''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painter==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 8076 wilfried israel museum.jpg|thumb|Wilfred Israel Museum]]
Gil started painting as a pastime when he was in his late twenties while still a career officer in the Israeli Air Force. When he was 42, he left his career in the Air Force to devote his time to painting but continued to fly as a reserve officer until his retirement in June 2003. After leaving the Air Force, Gil moved with his wife to [[Ein Hod]], an artist's village on the coast of [[Mediterranean Sea|the Mediterranean]]. Gil started doing commissioned portraits, including a portrait from a photograph of [[Ayn Rand]]. Gil likes to paint still-life paintings and innocently sensual nudes. In 1995 and 1998, Gil had two shows at the Wilfred Israel Museum in Northern Israel. Gil has also exhibited some of his work in Israeli galleries, but the reviews of his work have been lukewarm or nonexistent.&lt;ref name=urigil/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michelle Fram-Cohen|title=Israeli Airman Attains New Heights In Painting|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/israeli-airman-attains-new-heights-painting|publisher=The Atlas Society|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
"Every sortie that I flew, every dogfight, is a brush-stroke in my portrait in the mirror into which I will peer when my operational life is over. When I reach that day, I want to be satisfied with what I see." &lt;ref&gt;"Uri Gil," Avi Shmoul, ''Lifestyles,'' Fall 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
