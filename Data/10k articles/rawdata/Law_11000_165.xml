The authors are members of the Section's Information Security Committee.  The document was the first overview of principles and a framework for the use of [[digital signature]]s and [[authentication]] in electronic commerce from a legal viewpoint, including technologies such as [[certificate authority|certificate authorities]] and [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI).  The guidelines were a product of a four-year collaboration by 70 [[lawyer]]s and technical experts from a dozen countries, and have been adopted as the model for legislation by some states in the [[United States|US]], including [[Florida]] and [[Utah]].

The Digital Signature Guidelines were followed by the Public Key Infrastructure Assessment Guidelines published by the ABA in 2003.

A similar effort was undertaken in Slovenia by the Digital Signature Working Group (within the [[Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia]] (CCIS)).

{{Politics of the African Union mini|judiciary|width=5em}}
The '''African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights''' ('''ACHPR''') is a [[quasi-judicial body]] tasked with promoting and protecting [[human rights]] and [[collective rights|collective (peoples') rights]] throughout the [[Africa|African continent]] as well as interpreting the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]] and considering individual complaints of violations of the Charter. This includes investigating human rights violations, creating and approving programs of action towards encouraging human rights, and set up effect communication between them and states to get first hand information on violations of human rights.&lt;ref name="Welch 1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Welch |first1=Claude |title=Organisation of African Unity and the Promotion of Human Rights |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=December 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ACHPR is under a regional government facility, they don't have any actual power and enforcement over laws. This ends up in them drafting up proposals to send up the chain of command to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government and they will act accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odinkalu |first1=Anselm |title=Proposals for Review of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission of Human and Peoples' Rights |journal=Human Rights Quarterly |date=August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) was based on the Banjul Charter which is the the regional human rights protectors of human rights for Africa .The charter has twenty-nine articles that go into great detail on the rights and freedoms that follow a strict code of non-discrimination.&lt;ref name="Welch 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Welch |first1=Claude |title=The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights: A Five-Year Report and Assessment |journal=Human Rights Quarterly |date=February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The support and excitement over the Europeans current rights system, the evolution of granting everyone human rights, is what helped streamline the creation of this commission and other courts in Africa. The Commission came into existence with the coming into force, on 21 October 1986, of the African Charter (adopted by the OAU on 27 June 1981). Although its authority rests on its own treaty, the African Charter, the Commission reports to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the [[African Union]] (formerly the [[Organization of African Unity]]).  Its first members were elected by the OAU's 23rd Assembly of Heads of State and Government in June 1987 and the Commission was formally installed for the first time on 2 November of that year. For the first two years of its existence, the Commission was based at the OAU Secretariat in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], but in November 1989 it relocated to [[Banjul]], [[Gambia]].  (NB: The ACHPR should be distinguished from the [[African Union Commission]], as the OAU Secretariat has been renamed since the creation of the African Union.)

The Commission meets twice a year: usually in March or April and in October or November. One of these meetings is usually in Banjul, where the Commission's secretariat is located; the other may be in any African state.

==Composition==
The commission opened it’s doors in 1987 with promises of the protection and evolution of Africa’s human rights. The Assembly of Head and State and Government,make there decisions by a vote of two-thirds the majority of all representatives from each country.&lt;ref name="Welch 1991"/&gt; The ACHPR is made up of eleven members, elected by secret ballot at the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government (subsequently, by the AU's [[Assembly of the African Union|Assembly]]). These members, who serve six-year renewable terms, are "chosen from amongst African personalities of the highest reputation, known for their high morality, integrity, impartiality and competence in matters of human and peoples' rights" (Charter, Article 31) and, in selecting these personalities, particular consideration is given "to persons having legal experience". 

The members are to enjoy full independence in discharging their duties and serve on a personal basis (i.e., not representing their home states); however, no member state may have more than one of its nationals on the Commission at any given time. The members choose, from among their own number, a chairperson and a Vice Chairperson, who each serve two-year renewable terms.

==Mandate==
The Commission has three broad areas of responsibility:

*Promoting human and peoples' rights
*Protecting human and peoples' rights
*Interpreting the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.achpr.org/about/|title=About ACHPR|last=|first=|date=|website=ACHPR|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals above may have been halted as the Commission was placed under heavy burdens, mainly financial issues in the late 80's, as they tried to complete activities for the countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=Rachel |title=Decisions by the African Commission on Individual Communications under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights |journal=The International and Comparative Law Quarterly |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The countries of Africa,excluding Ethiopia and Liberia, are heavily influenced by colonialism, overall has a weak government, and a declining economy.&lt;ref name="Welch 1992"/&gt; In pursuit of these goals, the Commission is mandated to "collect documents, undertake studies and researches on African problems in the field of human and peoples, rights, organise seminars, symposia and conferences, disseminate information, encourage national and local institutions concerned with human and peoples' rights and, should the case arise, give its views or make recommendations to governments" (Charter, Art. 45).

With the creation of the [[African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights]] (under a protocol to the Charter which was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in January 2004), the Commission will have the additional task of preparing cases for submission to the Court's jurisdiction. In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the [[African Court of Justice]]. In 2011, the commission brought before the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights a case against Libya.

==Special mechanisms==
{{anchor|Special rapporteur}}{{Multiple issues|section=yes|

The '''American Convention on Human Rights''', also known as the '''Pact of San José''', is an [[International human rights instruments|international human rights instrument]]. It was adopted by many countries in the Western Hemisphere in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], [[Costa Rica]], on 22 November 1969. It came into force after the eleventh instrument of ratification (that of [[Grenada]]) was deposited on 18 July 1978.

The bodies responsible for overseeing compliance with the Convention are the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] and the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]], both of which are organs of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).

==Content and purpose==

According to its preamble, the purpose of the Convention is "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."

Chapter I establishes the general obligation of the states parties to uphold the rights set forth in the Convention to all persons under their jurisdiction, and to adapt their domestic laws to bring them into line with the Convention. The 23 articles of Chapter II give a list of individual civil and political rights due to all persons, including the right to life "in general, from the moment of conception",&lt;ref&gt;Article 4(1). To understand the breadth of this statement see [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1776922 Controversial Conceptions: The Unborn in the American Convention on Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; to humane treatment, to a fair trial, to [[privacy]], to [[freedom of conscience]], [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of movement]], etc. Article 15 prohibits "any propaganda for war and any advocacy of national, racial, or religious hatred that constitute incitement to lawless violence or to any other similar action against any person on any grounds including those of race, color, religion, language, or national origin" to be considered as offence punishable by law.&lt;ref&gt;Article 13(5)&lt;/ref&gt; This provision is established under influence of  Article 20 of the [[International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]]. The single article in Chapter III deals with [[economic, social, and cultural rights]].
The somewhat cursory treatment given  to this issue here was expanded some ten years later with the '''Protocol of San Salvador''' (see below).

Chapter IV describes those circumstances in which certain rights can be temporarily suspended, such as during states of emergency, and the formalities to be followed for such suspension to be valid. However, it does not authorize any suspension of Article 3 (right to juridical personality), Article 4 (right to life), Article 5 (right to humane treatment), Article 6 (freedom from slavery), Article 9 (freedom from [[ex post facto law]]s), Article 12 (freedom of conscience and religion), Article 17 (right to family), Article 18 (right to the name), Article 19 (rights of the child), Article 20 (right to nationality), or Article 23 (right to participate in government).&lt;ref&gt;Article 27(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter V, with a nod to the balance between rights and duties enshrined in the earlier [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]], points out that individuals have responsibilities as well as rights.

Chapters VI, VII, VIII, and IX contain provisions for the creation and operation of the two bodies responsible for overseeing compliance with the Convention: the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights|Inter-American Commission]], based in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]], and the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights|Inter-American Court]], headquartered in [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], [[Costa Rica]].

Chapter X deals with mechanisms for ratifying the Convention, amending it or placing reservations in it, or denouncing it. Various transitory provisions are set forth in Chapter XI.''''''

==Additional protocols==

In the ensuing years, the states parties to the American Convention have supplemented its provisions with two additional protocols.

The first, the '''Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights''' (more commonly known as the "Protocol of San Salvador"), was opened for signature in the city of [[San Salvador]], [[El Salvador]], on 17 November 1988. It represented an attempt to take the inter-American human rights system to a higher level by enshrining its protection of so-called [[Three generations of human rights|second-generation rights]] in the economic, social, and cultural spheres. The protocol's provisions cover such areas as the right to work, the right to health, the right to food, and the right to education. It came into effect on 16 November 1999 and has been ratified by 16 nations (see below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/sigs/a-52.html Additional Protocol to the American Convention On Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights ("Protocol of San Salvador")]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, the '''Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty''', was adopted at [[Asunción]], [[Paraguay]], on 8 June 1990. 
While Article 4 of the American Convention had already placed severe restrictions on the states' ability to impose the death penalty – only applicable for the most serious crimes; no reinstatement once abolished; not to be used for political offenses or common crimes; not to be used against those aged under 18 or over 70, or against pregnant women – signing this protocol formalizes a state's solemn commitment to refrain from using capital punishment in any peacetime circumstance. To date it has been ratified by 13 nations (see below).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/Sigs/a-53.html Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights to Abolish the Death Penalty]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-American Court's Interpretation==

The Inter-American Court makes a broad interpretation of the American Convention.  It interprets it according to the pro hominem principle, in an evolutive fashion and making use of other treaties and soft law.  The result is that, in practice, the Inter-American Court modifies the content of the American Convention&lt;ref&gt;To understand the breadth of this statement see [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090993 The American Convention on Human Rights: Updated by the Inter-American Court]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Trinidad and Tobago denounced the Convention on 26 May 1998 (effective 26 May 1999) over the [[death penalty]] issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice to Denounce the American Convention on Human Rights|url=https://www.oas.org/dil/treaties_B-32_American_Convention_on_Human_Rights_sign.htm#Trinidad%20and%20Tobago|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela denounced the Convention on 10 September 2012 accusing the Inter-American Court and Commission to undermine its Government's stability by interfering with its domestic affairs. Necessary reforms of the institution were blocked. Therefore, it would henceforth increase its cooperation with the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to the OAS Secretary General|url=http://www.oas.org:8101/DIL/Nota_República_Bolivariana_Venezuela_to_SG.English.pdf|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Denunciations, according to Article 78 of the ACHR, become effective one year after having been declared. They do not release the state party from its obligations resulting from acts that have occurred before the effective date of denunciation.

The treaty is open to all OAS member states, although to date it has not been ratified by [[Canada]] or several of the [[Anglophone Caribbean|English-speaking Caribbean]] nations; the [[United States]] signed it in 1977 but has not proceeded with ratification.

Canada did at one point seriously consider ratification, but has decided against it, despite being in principle in favour of such a treaty. The ACHR, having been largely drafted by the predominantly [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] nations of Latin America,{{cn|date=October 2018}} contains pro-life provisions, specifically, Article 4.1:
{{cquote|Every person has the right to have his life respected.  This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception.  No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.&lt;ref&gt;To understand the breadth of this statement see [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1776922 Controversial Conceptions: The Unborn in the American Convention on Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This conflicts with the [[Abortion in Canada|current legality of abortions in Canada]]. Although Canada could ratify the convention with a reservation with respect to abortion (as did [[Abortion in Mexico|Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidh.org/Basicos/English/Basic4.Amer.Conv.Ratif.htm Basic Documents: Ratifications of the Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;), that would contradict Canada's stated opposition to the making of reservations to human rights treaties. Another solution would be for the other states to remove the anti-abortion provisions, but that is unlikely to occur due to strong opposition to abortion in those countries.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Anti-whaling''' refers to actions taken by those who seek to end [[whaling]] in various forms, whether locally or globally in the pursuit of [[marine conservation]].&lt;ref name="gpwc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Whaling |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/whaling |accessdate=February 26, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301222955/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/whaling |archivedate=March 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSCS"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Whales' Navy |publisher=[[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] |url=http://www.seashepherd.org/whales |accessdate=February 26, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100210074520/http://www.seashepherd.org/whales| archivedate= February 10, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[activism]] is often a response to specific conflicts with pro-whaling countries and organizations that practice commercial [[whaling]] and/or [[Whaling in Japan#Research whaling|research whaling]], as well as with [[indigenous groups]] engaged in [[aboriginal whaling|subsistence whaling]]. Some anti-whaling factions have received criticism and legal action for extreme methods including violent [[direct action]].&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;{{cite news |title=Australia condemns anti-whaling protest|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=March 3, 2008 |url=http://news.smh.com.au/national/australia-condemns-antiwhaling-protest-20080303-1whu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dtau"&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan may press charges against anti-whaler |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=February 16, 2010 |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/world/japan-may-press-charges-against-anti-whaler/story-e6frev00-1225831136819}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''anti-whaling''' may also be used to describe beliefs and activities related to these actions.

== History ==
{{See also|Whale conservation|Marine conservation activism}}
Anti-whaling activism has a short history compared to other forms of activism and [[environmental awareness]]. Early members of environmental organizations began protesting whale hunts around the world in the 20th century. These actions were in direct response to the global depletion of whale populations due to over-exploitation by the [[whaling]] industry and the failure of international whaling regulations.&lt;ref name="gpwc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSCS2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seashepherd.org/whales/sea-shepherd-history.html |title=SSCS History |publisher=Seashepherd.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whaling regulation ===
[[File:ICRW-signing-1946-US.jpg|thumb|right|Signing the [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], Washington, D.C., Dec 2, 1946]]

The [[League of Nations]] raised concerns about the [[over-exploitation]] of whale stocks and called for conservation measures in 1925. This eventually led to the Geneva Convention for the Regulation of Whaling which was presented in 1931 but did not enter into force until 1934 and was completely ignored by Germany and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In 1937 the International Conference on Whaling added limits on [[pelagic]] whaling in order to prevent excessive exploitation (and specifically the extinction of the [[blue whale]]), thereby creating the International Agreement for the Regulation of Whaling.

The [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]] was created in 1946 in Washington to "provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry".&lt;ref name="IWC convention"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Convention|publisher=[[International Whaling Commission]] |url=http://www.iwcoffice.org/commission/convention.htm |accessdate=February 28, 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211222556/http://www.iwcoffice.org/commission/convention.htm| archivedate= February 11, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the previous 1937 Agreement and subsequent protocols to that agreement in 1938 and 1945, the ICRW led to the 1949 creation of the [[International Whaling Commission]] along with guidelines for the international regulation of coastal and pelagic whaling. Critics charge that the IWC and ICRW have largely failed due to a lack of enforceable rules and regulatory loopholes.&lt;ref name="DDay.0"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=48–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''Without exception every whaling operation in the world is, in some form or another, violating the regulations, principles or quotas which are the basis of the international attempt to conserve or manage whales... At the heart of the continued violations of the IWC's quota system is the ineffective observer scheme. The present system is so incomplete and lacking both in resources and personnel that it hardly exists.''&lt;ref name="DDay.0"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Craig Van Note}}

In 1966 the [[Convention on Fishing and Conservation of Living Resources of the High Seas]] took the first steps in [[marine conservation]] worldwide. This international treaty was designed to specifically counter the over-exploitation of [[sealife]] including whales.&lt;ref name="CIA World Fact Book, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Factbook|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]|year=2003|isbn=978-1-57980-939-3|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] produced a 52-0 vote in favor of a 10-year global moratorium on commercial whaling. However, the UN resolution was not adopted by the IWC. Iceland, Japan, Norway, Panama, Russia and South Africa voted no.&lt;ref name="DDay.1"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=29–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, a moratorium was once again proposed and voted down in the IWC lacking the required 3/4 majority. Iceland, Japan, Norway, Russia and South Africa voted no.&lt;ref name="DDay.1"/&gt;

Between 1973 and 1982 the IWC would see its membership increase from 14 countries to 37.

=== National protection ===
In 1972 the United States passed the [[Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972|Marine Mammal Protection Act]] as the first article of legislation to call specifically for an [[ecosystem]] approach to natural resource management and [[Habitat conservation|conservation]]. The act prohibits the hunting and killing of marine mammals, and enacts a moratorium on the import, export, and sale of any marine mammal, along with any marine mammal part or product within the United States.&lt;ref name="US fws.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marine Mammals |publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] |url=http://www.fws.gov/habitatconservation/marine_mammals.html |accessdate=February 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312025947/http://www.fws.gov/habitatconservation/marine_mammals.html |archivedate=March 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the United States also enacted the [[Ocean Dumping Act|Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act]] which established the [[U.S. National Marine Sanctuary|National Marine Sanctuaries]] program.

The United States would later play a significant role in the acceptance of a global moratorium on commercial whaling due to its domestic laws. In particular the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen's Protection Act gives the [[US President]] legal authority to prohibit importation of fish products from any nation that is diminishing the effectiveness of fisheries conservation programs. It was later strengthened by the 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act giving additional sanctioning power with regard to the ICRW.&lt;ref name="DDay.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oceancommission.gov/documents/gov_oceans/Protective.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030220001911/http://www.oceancommission.gov/documents/gov_oceans/Protective.PDF |archivedate=February 20, 2003 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

=== Save the Whales ===
Popular culture grew to widely accept whales and [[dolphins]] as interesting, entertaining and intelligent over the latter half of the 20th century. From the original tourist attractions at [[Marineland of Florida|Marineland]] to giant [[SeaWorld]] theme parks, captive dolphins and [[orcas]] (killer whales) became star attractions. The 1960s television series, ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]'', starred a [[Lassie]]-like dolphin character who befriends a young boy and performs feats of intelligence often saving the day. The 1967 novel, ''[[The Day of the Dolphin (book)|The Day of the Dolphin]]'' which inspired the [[The Day of the Dolphin|1973 film]], featured dolphins trained to speak English that help to save the world from nuclear destruction. In 1970 the biologist and environmentalist [[Roger Payne]] recorded and produced the popular ''[[Songs of the Humpback Whale (album)|Songs of the Humpback Whale]]'' album, after his 1967 discovery (with Scott McVay) of [[Whale song]] among [[Humpback whales]].&lt;ref name="REllis.0"&gt;{{Cite book

With the growing popularity of entertaining cetaceans came information and even warnings about the threats to these adored animals. In 1966, Scott McVay first revealed the plight of whales to the public in his article, "The Last of the Great Whales", for ''Scientific American'' and two years later "Can Leviathan Long Endure So Wide a Chase?" in ''Natural History''. Joan McIntyre (who later went on to found Project Jonah in 1972) both celebrated the whale and condemned the whaler in the 1974 publication, ''Mind in the Waters''. In 1975, ''Audubon'' dedicated an entire issue to whales titled, "Vanishing Giants." From 1968-1976 ''The UnderSeaWorld of Jacques Cousteau'' included film of whales, dolphins and other marine mammals as subjects of educational television. In 1977, ''National Geographic'' aired "The Great Whales" with scenes of whales being killed.&lt;ref name="REllis.0"/&gt;

Before long, the words "Save the Whales" began to appear on bumper stickers, fliers, T-shirts and petitions. Conservation groups dedicated to this purpose formed including both average citizens and social radicals whose ideas on how to respond varied widely. The first was the [[American Cetacean Society]] which was formed in 1971 and quickly followed by the Whale Center and Connecticut Cetacean Society. Well established environmental organizations like the [[World Wildlife Fund]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], the [[Humane Society of the United States]], the [[Sierra Club]] and the [[National Audubon Society]] also joined the movement.&lt;ref name="REllis.0"/&gt;

The environmental organization [[Greenpeace]] formed in the early 1970s as an offshoot of the [[Sierra Club]]. In 1975 Greenpeace launched its first anti-whaling campaign by actively confronting Soviet whaling fleets in the North Pacific.&lt;ref name="gpwc" /&gt; Two years later a splinter group of Greenpeace members formed the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] to protect sea life specifically using radical methods of [[direct action]].&lt;ref name="dtau" /&gt;

=== Direct action: Russia ===
The environmental group [[Greenpeace]] pioneered anti-whaling activism in the form of direct action. [[Paul Spong]], a New Zealand scientist who once studied the intelligence of orcas and friend of Canadian author [[Farley Mowat]], helped convince then Greenpeace director, [[Robert Hunter (journalist)|Robert Hunter]], that the organization should confront [[Whaling#Russia|Russian whalers]] in the Pacific. Spong, under the guise of a scientist studying [[sperm whales]], gained vital information on the coordinates of whaling fleets from the Bureau of Whaling Statistics in Norway. With this information, Greenpeace sailed out aboard the ''Phyllis Cormack'', named for the wife of its original owner.&lt;ref name="ADarby.1"&gt;{{Cite book

On June 27, 1975, members of Canadian Greenpeace took the first ever direct action against whalers who were actively whaling near the Mendocino Ridge about 40 miles west of California. The Greenpeace activists navigated small inflatable [[Zodiac Marine &amp; Pool|Zodiac boats]] between the Russian whalers of the ''[[Russian Far East|Dalniy Vostok]]'' fleet and the hunted whales. The tactic was intended to prevent the whaling ship gunner from firing the harpoon cannon due to the risk of accidentally striking and harming one of the activists. However, the Russian catcher ship ''Vlastny'' fired directly over the heads of Robert Hunter and activist Paul Watson. The event was filmed by Greenpeace and later broadcast in the United States by the [[CBS Evening News]] with [[Walter Cronkite]] and other major television networks. The activists were unable to stop the Russian whalers but the airing of this event on television was significant in raising public awareness by making the ''Save the Whales'' movement front-page news for the first time.&lt;ref name="REllis.1"&gt;{{Cite book

{{Quotation|''The whale wavered and towered motionless above us. I looked up past the daggered six-inch teeth into a massive eye, an eye the size of my fist, an eye that reflected back an intelligence, an eye that spoke wordlessly of compassion, an eye that communicated that this whale could discriminate and understood what we had tried to do...On that day, I knew emotionally and spiritually that my allegiance lay with the whale first and foremost over the interests of the humans that would kill them.''&lt;ref name="ADarby.2"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In mid-July 1976, the Canadian Greenpeace deployed a newly acquired ship, an ex-minesweeper called the ''James Bay'', to confront the ''Dalniy Vostok'' factory ship and its catcher fleet once again. The activists found the Russian whalers midway between California and Hawaii. However, this time the whalers did not fire their harpoon cannons. Instead, the Russian fleet retreated and Greenpeace chased the whalers for two days and nights before being forced to return to Hawaii for refueling. After replenishing their fuel and supplies, the activists found and disrupted the Russian fleet again and chased the whalers northward as far as their fuel permitted.&lt;ref name="REllis.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.3"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of July 1977, the ''James Bay'' once again found Russian whalers in the Pacific. This time the factory ship ''Vladivostok'', sister ship of the ''Vostok'', and its catcher fleet was confronted about 700 miles off the coast of California. The activists filmed whalers at work and documented the Russians taking undersized whales. The human barrier tactic was used again but the whalers fired over the activists.&lt;ref name="REllis.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.3"/&gt;

A newly formed [[Greenpeace Foundation|Hawaii based Greenpeace]] organization joined in the Pacific campaign against Russian whalers with a fast former sub-chaser called the ''Ohana Kai''. The activists found the ''Vostok'' fleet 1,000 miles north of Hawaii. With her superior speed, the ''Ohana Kai'' chased the ''Vostok'' which ceased whaling during the pursuit. After a week, a team of activists boarded the ''Vostok'' with anti-whaling propaganda for the crew. At end of the summer the ''Vladivostok'' ceased whaling for another week, while it was followed by the ''James Bay'', and was also boarded by the activists.&lt;ref name="REllis.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.3"/&gt;

=== Project Jonah: Australia ===
For several years leading up to September 1977, the environmental organization, Project Jonah, campaigned against whaling in Australia by lobbying, raising public awareness and increasing domestic pressure on the Australian government to close down the last whaling station, the [[Cheyne Beach Whaling Station]]. French activist, [[Dolphin Research Center|Jean-Paul Fortom-Gouin]], was impressed with the Greenpeace actions in the North Pacific and decided on a more aggressive approach.&lt;ref name="REllis.2"&gt;{{Cite book

Fortom-Gouin financed the operation and dubbed his group, which included Greenpeace's Robert Hunter, the Whale and Dolphin Coalition (Fortom-Gouin had also largely financed the Greenpeace-Hawaii action against Russian whalers). He had previously worked with the Australian Project Jonah while serving as Panama's official representative to the IWC meeting in Canberra just two months prior.&lt;ref name="REllis.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.4"/&gt;

The effort to intervene against whaling in Australia did not go smoothly. In town, a gang of bikers called "God's Garbage", whose members also happened to be employed butchering whales, harassed the demonstrators. The activist group had not managed to arrange for a large mother-ship to support their Zodiacs as they chased whalers tens of miles out into shark filled waters in small inflatable boats carrying loads of excess fuel. The whaling company even brought the media out on its own boats after several days of prepping the reporters and explaining the benefits of whaling. When the activists attempted to get between the whalers and their targets the gunners fired over the Zodiacs resulting in several close calls for their crews. In the end, the action did not save a single whale.&lt;ref name="REllis.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.4"/&gt;

However, thanks to Project Jonah's long term lobbying and educational efforts, Australian public opinion against whaling was estimated to be about 70 percent. In fact, Phoebe Fraser, the young daughter of the Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, wore a "Save the Whale" badge during the election campaign. The Prime Minister appointed an independent inquiry which recommended in 1978 that Australia outlaw whaling, ban all production and import of whale products and change its policies to oppose whaling domestically and internationally. Australia became an anti-whaling nation.&lt;ref name="REllis.2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.4"/&gt;

=== Investigation: pirate whaling ===
A non-government observer at the IWC took an interest in the unseen whaling operations conducted by private interests outside of the regulatory body. Through an international network of contacts and with financial assistance from environmental organizations, Nick Carter traced documents of insurance, ownership, billing, import and export and more. His determined research uncovered evidence of unregulated whaling on a massive scale that environmentalists refer to as "pirate whaling".&lt;ref name="DDay.5"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=34–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"&gt;{{Cite book

One pirate whaler in particular came to represent the worst of the unregulated whaling industry. Carter's evidence exposed the MV ''Sierra'' as a diesel powered hybrid catcher-factory ship hunting throughout the Atlantic in violation of many national laws, and completely without regard for international whaling regulations. The name of the vessel (''Robert W. Vinke'', MV ''Run'', MV ''Sierra'') and its ownership (companies from the Netherlands to Norway, Liechtenstein, the Bahamas, South Africa and Panama) had changed several times as well as her home port (various European and African ports) and flags of convenience (Dutch, Bahamian, Sierra Leonean, Somalian, Cypriot). ''Sierra'' was whaling illegally in areas forbidden by the IWC, prosecuted in the Bahamas and South Africa, forbidden entry to British controlled ports, and more. She harpooned critically endangered species, undersized whales, mothers and nursing calves, regardless of season, without license and without reporting her actions.&lt;ref name="DDay.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REllis.4"&gt;{{Cite book

 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To maximize profits, ''Sierra'''s motley international crew (which even staged a mutiny that left one Norwegian captain wounded and marooned in Angola) used cold harpoons without expensive explosive tips, which prolonged the suffering of the animal, and often kept only the prime-cuts of [[whale meat|meat]] while dumping most of the whale carcass. The design of the ship itself, a catcher-factory hybrid complete with freezers to preserve the meat, enabled ''Sierra'' to operate in a cost effective manner without a large fleet that would draw attention.&lt;ref name="DDay.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;

In October, 1975, Carter released his investigative report to IWC commissioners and observers as well as international news media. The Norwegian bank, Forrentningsbanken, was exposed as the owner which prompted an immediate change to Beacon-Sierra Ltd.. Japan's Taiyo Fishing Company was implicated with copies of a contract with ''Sierra'' for meat production, photos and names of Japanese crew aboard ''Sierra'', and photos of cargo falsely labeled "Fresh Frozen Whale Meat. Produce of Spain" transferred to a Japanese cargo ship.&lt;ref name="DDay.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;

Nick Carter was officially recognized by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) for his investigative role in exposing pirate whaling as well as other illicit trade in wildlife after his death in 2000. He was previously awarded the Goldman Prize in 1997 and highly regarded in his home country and internationally among conservationists.&lt;ref name="UNEP"&gt;

However, in the 1970s pirate whaling continued despite the public exposure and ''Sierra'' would not be stopped until a fateful confrontation with another anti-whaling activist named Paul Watson.

=== Direct action: Iceland ===
Allen Thornton, a Canadian activist, traveled to England in 1976 to establish a European Greenpeace presence. His fund raising efforts drew generous donations from comedian [[Spike Milligan]] and [[The Beatles]]. In 1977, he helped establish Greenpeace-UK. The new office was followed by additional Greenpeace offices in France, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Greenpeace activist, David McTaggart, assumed overall leadership of Greenpeace International. With the contributions in Europe and a grant from the World Wildlife Fund, the Greenpeace ship, ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]'', was deployed in 1978 to confront Iceland's whalers in the North Atlantic.&lt;ref name="DDay.6"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1978 campaign, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' spent a month interfering with whaling operations in Icelandic waters without incident. 

In the [[1986 Hvalur sinkings]], activists from the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] sank two unoccupied whaling vessels, ''Hvalur 6'' and ''Hvalur 7'', and sabotaged a whale processing station in [[Hvalfjörður]].&lt;ref name="Grapevine 2006-11-03"&gt;Björnsson, Sveinn Birkir [http://www.grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Whaler-Down Whaler Down: Looking back at the sinking of the whaleboats in 1986] ''[[The Reykjavik Grapevine]]'', November 3, 2006. Retrieved May 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct action: pirate whaling ===
After splitting from Greenpeace, activist Paul Watson, with funding and support from [[Cleveland Amory]] (founder of The Fund for Animals), acquired a 779-ton deep-water trawler and renamed the ship, the ''Sea Shepherd''. The bow of the ship was reinforced with many tons of concrete and set out for the North Atlantic to confront the infamous pirate whaler, ''Sierra''.&lt;ref name="ADarby.4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="REllis.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.7"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=71–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Van Note, of the Monitor Consortium (a group of conservation organizations based in Washington), provided Watson with vital information on the location of the ''Sierra'' from a global network of sources.&lt;ref name="REllis.4"/&gt;

On July 15, 1979, the ''Sea Shepherd'' found the ''Sierra'' near Oporto, Portugal and chased the whaler to the port of Leixoes. ''Sierra'' pretended to enter the port as if to dock and avoid further confrontation. However, as the ''Sea Shepherd'' entered the port the ''Sierra'' turned and fled leaving Watson to deal with the Portuguese harbor pilots who boarded the ship to guide her in, and the harbor officials who planned to detain the activist vessel. Fourteen members of the crew were unwilling to continue and Watson left them ashore taking the ''Sea Shepherd'' out with a crew of three after the ''Sierra''.&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REllis.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME.1"/&gt;

When Watson caught up with the ''Sierra'' he put the concrete reinforced bow to work and rammed the pirate whaler. The first strike landed at the bow of the ''Sierra'' in a failed attempt to knock out the harpoon gun. For the second and final blow, the ''Sea Shepherd'' rammed the ''Sierra'' amidships leaving a large gash in the pirate whaler's hull. Despite the damage, ''Sierra'' was able to limp back to Leixoes but hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of repairs would be needed to make the ship sea worthy again. ''Sea Shepherd'' attempted to escape but was quickly met by a Portuguese destroyer and escorted back to port. Watson was briefly arrested and was threatened with the forfeiture of his ship by the decision of a Portuguese court. After several months of efforts to have the ''Sea Shepherd'' released, and with most of its valuable equipment stolen, Watson and engineer Peter Woof scuttled the ship to prevent her from falling into the whalers' hands.&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REllis.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME.1"/&gt;

{{Quotation|''We traded a ship for a ship, but it was a great trade because we also traded our ship for the lives of hundreds of whales that would be spared from the ''Sierra''.''&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Watson}}

In February 1980, just as the ''Sierra'' was nearly completely repaired and refitted to continue whaling, unknown saboteurs hired by the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=afiercegreenfire|title=Paul Watson - Sinking the Sierra|date=2011-04-15|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8nPOcTchamk|accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; used magnetic limpet mines to blow a hole in her side and sank the pirate whaler in Lisbon harbor, permanently ending her career.&lt;ref name="REllis.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.7"/&gt;

However, ''Sierra'' was hardly the world's only pirate whaling ship. Nick Carter's continued efforts, in addition to investigations by Greenpeace and other groups, also uncovered pirate whalers in South America with an operation in Brazil labeled as a "Japanese whaling colony" by environmentalists. In Chile, a whaler operating in the service of a Panamanian front company conducted coastal whaling. In Peru, three pirate whalers were hunting year-round. Elsewhere, in Taiwan four pirate whaling ships were taking whales from the South China Sea and others out of Korea were at work in the Sea of Japan. In each case, links to Japanese companies (particularly Taiyo Gyogyo) were discovered.&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REllis.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.8"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prosecution: South Africa ===
In April 1979, [[Colin Eglin]], leader of the South African opposition, urged the government to investigate pirate whaling while Andrew Behr (owner of the ''Sierra'' and other pirate whalers) now denied any links to such activities. However, at the same time two Panamanian flagged whaling ships, ''Susan'' and ''Theresa'' (each named for Behr's daughters), were being converted into hybrid factory-catcher ships just like the ''Sierra'' by a South African shipbuilder.&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.9"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[Cape Times]]'' reporter, Stephen Wrottesley, also discovered the Sierra Fishing Company was hiring a new crew in the Cape Town area and another ship, the MV ''Fisher'' (formerly the MV ''Yashima Maru''), was also being refitted for whaling and was registered in Panama. [[Nick Carter (environmentalist)|Nick Carter]], his colleague Nan Rice, and many other conservationists personally urged Colin Eglin to act while international environmental organizations pressured the government for an official inquiry. When port authorities ordered all South African nationals off of the ''Fisher'', a foreign crew took the ship to the Canary Islands and it was renamed the ''Astrid''. Soon after, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society distributed wanted posters advertising a $25,000 reward to anyone who would sink it. Andrew Behr relocated himself and his family to England and the ''Susan'' and ''Theresa'' were seized as a result of the inquiry. The legal battle to have the ships released failed and years later the two pirate whalers were used for target practice and destroyed by the South African Navy.&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="REllis.5"/&gt;

=== Direct action: Spain ===
Industria Ballenera SA (IBSA) was Spain's only remaining whaling company which had operated with government support and without the restrictions of international regulations as Spain was not a member of the IWC. However, as a result of the ''Sierra'' scandal and increasing pressure from the US, Japan officially banned the import of whale meat from non-IWC members on July 5, 1979. Predictably, Spain joined the IWC at the start of its next annual meeting and continued to ship whale meat to Japan.&lt;ref name="REllis.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.10"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1979, two explosions were heard in the port of Corbubión (Galicia, Spain) but the whaling ships there were not damaged. Then on April 27, 1980, the whalers ''Ibsa I'' and ''Ibsa II'' were sunk in the port of Marin by unknown saboteurs hired by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/our-history.html|title=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society - Our History {{!}} Who We Are|newspaper=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with limpet mines in a manner similar to the sinking of the ''Sierra''.&lt;ref name="ADarby.4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.10" /&gt;

Later on June 17, 1980, Greenpeace activists aboard the ''Rainbow Warrior'' confronted the whaling ship, ''Ibsa III'', again deploying zodiacs to maneuver between the whalers and the whales. After a few hours of interference, warships from the Spanish Navy arrived to pursue and eventually board the Greenpeace ship. The activist crew was formally arrested and the ''Rainbow Warrior'' confiscated despite claims that the incident took place in international waters.&lt;ref name="DDay.11"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=84–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charged in a military court, the captain of the ''Rainbow Warrior'', Jonathan Castle, refused to pay the $142,000 fine (1,200,000 pesetas) and the ship was held in the military harbor O Ferrol. Spanish authorities disabled the activist vessel by removing the thrust block from its engine. However, for five months Greenpeace members kept the ship otherwise seaworthy while a secret effort was made to find a new thrust block. A replacement part was found, smuggled into Spain, and walked past the Spanish guards by Greenpeace members laughing and acting as if returning from a bout of drinking. Finally, on November 8 the ''Rainbow Warrior'' escaped under cover of darkness during a changing of the guard. The Spanish Navy was unable (or unwilling) to find and recapture the activists who were given a heroes' welcome in Jersey on November 11 by cheering crowds. Later, on November 15, the ship finally arrived to Amsterdam, her base.&lt;ref name="DDay.11" /&gt;

In 1981, the Spanish Socialist Workers Party sponsored a motion long supported by organized environmental lobbying to compel Spain's IWC delegates to vote for a moratorium and immediate halt to whaling. The motion passed on December 16 of the same year with an overwhelming majority.&lt;ref name="DDay.11" /&gt;

=== Sanctuary: Indian Ocean ===
In 1979 the influence of environmentalists was realized in the membership of the International Whaling Commission through the nation of Seychelles. Dr. Sidney Holt, a well known marine biologist and former IWC scientific committee member (one of the "Three Wise Men"), envisioned an ocean refuge for whales. Holt's companion, Lyall Watson, a respected nature writer in Seychelles, put him in contact with the nation's president, Albert Rene. The tiny island country joined the IWC and Holt watched from an NGO observer's seat as Lyall Watson led the Seychelles delegation to propose and succeed in establishing an Indian Ocean whale sanctuary.&lt;ref name="DDay.12"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=118–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADarby.5"&gt;{{Cite book

However, the environmental victory did not come without cost. Japan responded in 1980 by ending a grant scheme to Seychelles for a fisheries research and training vessel. A letter from the Japanese ambassador explained this grant would not be extended to the tiny island nation due to its position in the International Whaling Commission and stated this decision would be reversed if the attitude of the Seychelles government changed at the IWC. Surprisingly, Maxine Ferrari, the Seychelles Minister of Development and Planning, quickly rejected and condemned Japan's actions. On January 9, 1981, the ''Sumi Maru No. 25'', a Japanese fishing boat, was seized while fishing in Seychelles waters and fined $115,000. In April, 1982, Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki offered a $40 million aid package to Seychelles which was ultimately rejected as well.&lt;ref name="ADarby.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.12a"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=128–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|''In this particular case, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regrets to note that the Japanese government, wilst expressing annoyance with Seychelles' positive stand in the IWC, did not take into consideration the indiscriminate and rapacious exploitation of the Seychelles fisheries resources by the Japanese fishing fleet over many years in the recent past. Making Japanese advanced technology available to Seychelles to sort out the mess left behind by Japanese fishermen would constitute but a meager form of restitution.''&lt;ref name="DDay.12a"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Invasion: Siberia ===
The Soviets reasoned that the best way to conduct a subsistence hunt was to employ a single modern whaling ship, the ''Zevezdny'', to catch whales on behalf of the Siberian native people. Instead of the average 10 to 30 whales historically claimed in one year, after 1955 the quota rose to nearly 200 gray whales and international observers were not permitted.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.13"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=93–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 1981, Paul Watson led a new crew, aboard the ''Sea Shepherd II'', from Nome, Alaska into the territorial waters of the Soviet Union. When the activists arrived at the Soviet whaling station village of Loren they quickly discovered that the whaling operation had been dedicated to producing feed for a commercial mink farm, complete with non-aboriginal blonde haired, blue eyed Russian workers. They managed to film and photograph the whaling station. The evidence was later turned over to Congress. The activists were soon running from the Russian military, including helicopter gunships and a destroyer, but managed to escape into American waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/who-we-are/our-history.html|title=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society - Our History {{!}} Who We Are|newspaper=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.13" /&gt;

On July 18, 1983, Greenpeace made its own incursion into Siberia during the week of the annual IWC conference. Greenpeace also landed at the whaling station at Loren. However, the Russians were not going to be caught off guard again. Soldiers and police arrested the seven that made it ashore. The ''Rainbow Warrior'' was also chased by warships and helicopters and after a six-hour ordeal safely returned to the US.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.13" /&gt;

The Greenpeace activists were held captive for several days before a transfer was arranged with an American delegation led by Nome, Alaska Mayor, Leo Rasmussen. On the US-Russian border in the Bering Strait, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' peacefully met Russian warships to retrieve its crew. Rasmussen gave the Soviets an "I Love Nome" button and returned with the activists aboard a Greenpeace zodiac.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.13" /&gt;

=== Investigation: Chile ===
In January 1979, a Greenpeace investigator, Campbell Plowden, narrowly avoided arrest by the Chilean [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] (secret police) as he gathered information, including photographic evidence, on the whaling operation in San Vicente, Chile|. In 1981, two more Greenpeace activists covertly researched Chilean coastal whaling. They found a fleet of three outdated whaling ships that were only able to land 77 whales in 1976 but increased the quota to 500 in 1978.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.14"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenpeace discovered Japan's investment in Chilean whaling included a hybrid catcher-factory ship originally named the ''Orient Maru No. 2'', then renamed the ''Paulmy Star III'', and in 1980 it became the ''Juan 9''. Although it was prohibited to sell whaling equipment to non-members, export documents revealed the whaling ship was falsely listed as a shrimp trawler before Chile joined the IWC. The whalers consistently violated IWC regulations including hunting out of season and killing protected species. In 1984, the propeller shaft of the ''Juan 9'' broke resulting in financial troubles that led creditors to seize the ship the next year.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.14"/&gt;

=== Investigation: China (Taiwan) ===
In 1979 and 1980, Greenpeace activists gathered evidence of pirate whaling operations in the South China Sea and uncovered a regional unregulated whale meat trade implicating Taiwan (China), South Korea, and Japan. People in Taiwan officials denied the existence of the pirate whalers, and Japan denied importing whale meat from Taiwan. However, the investigators discovered four (formerly Japanese) whaling ships (''Sea Bird'', ''Sea Flower'', ''Chi Hsin'', ''Chu Feng'') with Taiwanese crews, Japanese officers, and Panamanian flags.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.15"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation continued in Japan's Tsukiji market where Campbell Plowden and Rebecca Clark found whale meat, packed by Marine Enterprises Co. Ltd (a South Korean front company), that had originally come from Taiwan. In 1979, Japan reported the import of 1,800 tons of whale meat from South Korea, but the Koreans had only reported the export of 400 tons. This led Plowden and Clark to the Marine Enterprises processing plant to gather proof of Taiwan provided whale meat repackaged as a product of Korea for shipment to Japan.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.15"/&gt;

In late February 1980, just days after these findings were reported to the United States government, Japanese customs agents seized 300 tons of Korean whale meat as illegally imported from Taiwan. The Taiwanese government responded to the threat of sanctions from the US and to the loss of Japan's support by impounding the pirate whaling ships.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.15"/&gt;

=== Direct action: Peru ===
In February 1978, an endangered blue whale washed ashore near the town of [[Conchan District|Conchan]], Peru and died from massive harpoon wounds as Peruvian conservationist, Felipe Benavides watched.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;

A Peruvian subsidiary of Japan's Taiyo Fisheries, known as Victoria del Mar, operated three coastal whaling ships (''Victoria'' 1, 2, and 7) with a shore station in [[Paita]]. In 1982, Greenpeace sent in the ''Rainbow Warrior''. On the December 13, several Greenpeace activists boarded the ''Victoria 7'' and chained themselves to the harpoon cannon. A day later, Peruvian marines cut the chains and arrested the protesters.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.16"&gt;{{harvnb |Day |1992 |pp=101–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greenpeace activists were threatened with charges of piracy. However, many Peruvians protested on their behalf including Felipe Benavides, who had opposed whaling for nearly 30 years. After several days, the activists were released with a $3,000 fine, and two weeks later, the ''Rainbow Warrior'' was released as well. Despite continued protest and international diplomatic pressure, Peru continued whaling until 1986.&lt;ref name="REllis.5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DDay.16"/&gt;

=== Ban on commercial whaling ===
After growing pressure from member nations, in 1979, the IWC established the [[Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary]] as a practical conservation measure. Three years later, in 1982, the IWC adopted a [[International Whaling Commission#1986 moratorium|moratorium]] on commercial whaling, which took effect in 1986 and allowed for scientific research whaling. When Japan resumed whale hunts under the auspices of a research program, some anti-whaling countries and organizations criticized the moratorium's loophole for continued commercial whaling.&lt;ref name="reut1"&gt;{{cite news| title=IWC draft plan sees end to commercial whaling ban |publisher=Reuters|date=February 23, 2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61M0RF20100223}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 31, 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan must stop its whaling in the Antarctic.&lt;ref name=abc-stop-science-whaling&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-03-31/ijc-japan-whaling-southern-ocean-scientific-research/5357416 |title=Japan ordered to immediately stop whaling in Antarctic as International Court of Justice rules program was not carried out for scientific purposes |work=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2014-03-31 |accessdate=2014-04-26 |quote=... the court's judges agreed with Australia that the Japanese research - two peer-reviewed papers since 2005, based on results obtained from just nine killed whales - was not proportionate to the number of animals killed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the IWC created the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]] in Antarctica to protect whales in their breeding grounds. Two additional sanctuaries were proposed in 1998 by anti-whaling nations, but they failed to get enough votes in the IWC.

[[File:Farley Mowat 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sea Shepherd's [[RV Farley Mowat|RV ''Farley Mowat'']], docked in Melbourne before setting out to pursue the Japanese whaling fleet in 2005.]]

=== Modern conflicts ===&lt;!-- section under construction, needs more detail and better flow--&gt;
Throughout the past decade, while pro- and anti-whaling nations debated and deliberated at the IWC, private activists have organized a range of protests against commercial whaling. Most notably, [[Greenpeace]] and [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] continue separate campaigns of direct action against whale hunts conducted by Norway, [[Iceland]], and Japan. Both also conduct media campaigns and other public outreach to raise awareness. Each organization criticizes the other for differing activist philosophies and each, in turn, receives criticism from both pro- and anti-whaling countries.&lt;ref name="smh" /&gt;

Tensions have grown over the past few years during Sea Shepherd's confrontations with Japanese whaling vessels in the whale sanctuary off the coast of Antarctica.&lt;ref name="SSCS" /&gt; In 2008, the documentary-style TV series ''[[Whale Wars]]'' began filming these confrontations, bringing some light to both sides of the controversy. The same year, two Greenpeace protesters were arrested in Japan for their investigation of [[whale meat]].&lt;ref name="gp_20080630"&gt;{{cite web|title=Global protest over arrest of Japanese whale activists (Updated) |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/free-the-tokyo-two-300608 |date=June 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012032101/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/news/free-the-tokyo-two-300608 |archivedate=October 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The governments of Australia and New Zealand, which have responsibility for maritime rescue in the area where the whale hunt is usually conducted, have repeatedly urged both sides to tone their responses down."&lt;ref name="dm1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-whaling activist boards Japanese ship to arrest captain for destruction of protest vessel|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=February 15, 2010|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1251092/Anti-whaling-activist-boards-Japanese-ship-arrest-captain-destruction-protest-vessel-Ady-Gil.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the Australian government, as an anti-whaling member of the IWC, set a November 2010 deadline to stop Japanese whaling in the [[Southern Ocean]] or face an international legal challenge.&lt;ref name="toban"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ban on commercial whaling 'to end'|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=February 24, 2010|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article7037220.ece | location=London | first=Anne | last=Barrowclough}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the IWC's ban on commercial whaling is under debate and could be overturned by the end of 2010.{{update after|2010|12|01}} In a compromise aimed at ending a deadlock between anti-whaling nations and whaling countries, such as Norway, Iceland, and Japan, the IWC would permit limited commercial hunting. The IWC proposal drew immediate criticism from environmentalists, who described it as "disaster for whales."&lt;ref name="reut1" /&gt;

== Subsistence hunting ==
[[File:Subsistencewhaling.png|thumb|200px|right|[[Inuit]] subsistence whaling. A [[beluga whale]] is [[Flensing|flensed]] for its [[Muktuk|maktaaq]] which is an important source of vitamin C in the diet of some [[Inuit]].&lt;ref name="arctic"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vitamin C in the Diet of Inuit Hunters From Holman, Northwest Territories|last1=Geraci|first1=Joseph|last2=Smith|first2=Thomas|journal=Arctic|volume=32|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=135–139|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic32-2-135.pdf|doi=10.14430/arctic2611}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{See also|Aboriginal whaling}}
There has been some resistance to subsistence hunting by the Sea Shepherd group. When the [[Makah people]] tried to revive [[Makah people#Whaling|their traditional hunt]] it was disrupted by Sea Shepherd's "chase boats". Greenpeace took a different position in stating that cultural revival of whaling by groups like the Makah is not the problem.&lt;ref name=burton2002&gt;{{cite book | last = Burton | first = Lloyd | title = Worship and Wilderness: Culture, Religion, and Law in the Management of Public Lands and Resources | publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]] Press | year = 2002 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SExNkpM_VSoC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=%22subsistence+whaling%22+sea+shepherd&amp;lr=&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22subsistence%20whaling%22%20sea%20shepherd&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-299-18084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace opposes all commercial whaling, claiming that it is not sustainable. However, they state that they do not oppose subsistence whaling by [[indigenous peoples]]. They promote [[whale watching]] as an alternative economic activity to commercial whaling.&lt;ref name="greenpeacefaq"&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenpeace Whaling FAQs|publisher=[[Greenpeace]]|url= http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/resources/faqs/whales |accessdate=March 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211212544/http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/resources/faqs/whales| archivedate= February 11, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods and tactics ==
Anti-whaling action is a part of both [[environmental activism]] and [[marine conservation]].&lt;ref name="gpwc2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Whaling |publisher=[[Greenpeace]] |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/whaling_myths |accessdate=December 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911202603/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/oceans/whaling/whaling_myths |archivedate=September 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of expression may include but are not limited to protest as demonstration and direct action, outreach through media, and political maneuvering.&lt;ref&gt;St. John Barned-Smith, "How We Rage: This Is Not Your Parents' Protest, " ''Current'' (Winter 2007): 17–25. ''See also [[Protest]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protest ===
Often the most visible expression of anti-whaling activism is through public [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] of [[protest]]: [[nonviolent]] action by groups of people, ranging from simple display of public [[signage]] and banners to [[picketing (protest)|picketing]], walking in a march, or meeting ([[Political rally|rally]]) to hear speakers. Actions such as [[blockades]] and [[sit-in]]s may also be referred to as demonstrations, although these would normally be considered direct action.&lt;ref name="gpwc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Public Protest"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Controlling+public+protest%3a+First+Amendment+implications.-a016473804 | title = Public Protest: First Amendment Implications | accessdate = December 16, 2009 | author=Daniel L. Schofield, S.J.D. | date=November 1994 | publisher=in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s ''[[FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin|Law Enforcement Bulletin]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Direct action]] is activity undertaken by individuals, groups, or governments to achieve anti-whaling goals outside of normal social/political channels: nonviolent and [[violent]] activities which target persons, groups, or property deemed to be engaged in whaling, commercial or otherwise. Examples of nonviolent direct action include [[strike action|strikes]], blockades, workplace occupations, sit-ins, and [[graffiti]]. Violent direct actions include [[sabotage]], [[vandalism]], and assault. Direct actions are sometimes a form of [[civil disobedience]], but some (such as strikes) do not always violate [[criminal law]].&lt;ref name="SSCS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Outreach ===
While protest often leads to publicity of anti-whaling activities, there are more direct ways to raise public awareness. [[Media activism]] uses media and communication technologies for social movement, and/or tries to change policies relating to media and communication. Websites, newsletters, calls to action, pamphlets, books, speaking tours, rallies and mass mailings are all examples of outreach efforts.&lt;ref name="SSCS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Other more formal ways of affecting change are [[political campaign]]ing, [[diplomacy]], [[negotiation]] and [[arbitration]], and [[lobbying]] are methods of influencing decisions made by the government (in groups or individually). This includes all attempts to influence legislators and officials, whether by other legislators, constituents, or organized groups.&lt;ref name="gpwc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Buscarini and Others v. San Marino''''' (application No. 24645/94) was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 1999.

==Facts==

The applicants, Cristoforo Buscarini and Emilio Della Balda, were elected to the [[Grand and General Council|General Grand Council]] (the parliament of the Republic of San Marino) in 1993. They requested permission from the [[Captains-Regent]] to take [[Oath of office|the oath required by the Elections Act]] without reference to any religious text. The Act referred to a decree of 27 June 1909, which laid down the wording of the oath to be taken by members of the parliament as follows: "I, …, swear on the [[Gospels|Holy Gospels]] [..]". The applicants originally took the oath in writing, omitting the reference to Gospels. Their oath was considered invalid, and the applicants took the oath on the Gospels, maintaining their protest.

==Proceedings and judgment==

In 1997, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] concluded unanimously that there had been a violation of Article 9. Sammarinese government maintained that the reaffirmation of traditional values represented by the taking of the oath was necessary in order to maintain public order.

The Court concluded that ''requiring the applicants to take the oath on the Gospels was tantamount to requiring two elected representatives of the people to swear allegiance to a particular religion, a requirement which is not compatible with Article 9 of the [[ECHR|Convention]]. As the ECtHR rightly stated in its report, it would be contradictory to make the exercise of a mandate intended to represent different views of society within Parliament subject to a prior declaration of commitment to a particular set of beliefs'' (Para. 39). The Court unanimously held that there was a violation of Article 9 of the ECHR ([[freedom of conscience]]).

{{Canadian citizenship}}
'''Canadian nationality law''' is promulgated by the Citizenship Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-29) since 1977. The Act determines who is, or is eligible to be, a [[citizenship|citizen]] of [[Canada]]. The Act replaced the previous [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] (S.C. 1946, c. 15; cited after 1970 as R.S.C. 1970, c. C-19) in 1977 and has gone through four significant amendments, in 2007, 2009, 2015 and 2017.

Canadian citizenship is typically obtained by birth in Canada on the principle of ''[[jus soli]]'', or birth abroad when at least one parent is a [[Canadians|Canadian citizen]] or by adoption by at least one Canadian citizen under the rules of ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. It can also be granted to a [[permanent resident (Canada)|permanent resident]] who has lived in Canada for a period of time through [[naturalization]]. [[Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] (IRCC, formerly known as Citizenship and Immigration Canada, or CIC) is the department of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] responsible for citizenship-related matters, including confirmation, grant, renunciation and revocation of citizenship.

On 19 June 2017, the Act has been amended for a fourth time by the [[42nd Canadian Parliament]]. A set of changes has already taken effect on that date, while the remaining provisions regarding naturalization came into force on 11 October 2017, and provisions regarding revocation of citizenship also came into force on 11 January 2018.&lt;ref name="c-6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes to the Citizenship Act as a Result of Bill C-6|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2018/02/changes_to_the_citizenshipactasaresultofbillc-6.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of British subject into Canadian citizenship==
{{Main|History of Canadian nationality law}}
[[File:First official Canadian Citizenship ceremony at the Supreme Court building.jpg|thumb|left|First official Canadian Citizenship ceremony; at the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] Building, [[Ottawa]], 1947]]
{{British subjects}}

After [[Canadian Confederation]] was achieved in 1867, the new [[Dominion]]'s "nationality law" initially closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom and all Canadians were classified as [[British subject]]s. Section 91(25) of the [[British North America Act, 1867]], passed by the British Parliament in London (now referred to as the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]), however, gave the [[Parliament of Canada]] authority over "Naturalization and Aliens". The Immigration Act, 1910, for example, created the status of "Canadian citizen".&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1910, c. 27&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguished those British subjects who were born, naturalized, or domiciled in Canada from those who were not, but was only applied for the purpose of determining whether someone was free of immigration controls.&lt;ref name=act1910&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VWXmxCcnz0C&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Immigration%20Act%2C%201910&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|page=73| title=A Collection of nationality laws of various countries, as contained in ...| first1=Richard W| last1=Flournoy| first2= Manley Ottmer| last2=Hudson| publisher=F.B. Rothman| year=1983| origyear=1930| isbn=0837705444| accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Naturalization Act, 1914, increased the period of residence required to qualify for naturalization in Canada as a British subject from three years to five years. A separate additional status of "Canadian national" was created under the Canadian Nationals Act, 1921, in order that Canada could participate in international forces or military expeditions separately from Britain.

Canadian independence from Britain was obtained incrementally between 1867 (confederation and Dominion status within the Empire) and 1982 ([[Patriation|patriation of the Canadian constitution]]). In 1931, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] provided that the United Kingdom would have no legislative authority over Dominions without the request and consent of that Dominion's government to have a British law become part of the law of the Dominion. The law also left the British North America Acts within the purview of the British parliament, because the federal government and the provinces could not agree on an amending formula for the Canadian constitution. (Similarly, the neighbouring [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] did not become independent because it never ratified the Statute.) When, in 1982, the British and Canadian parliaments produced the mutual [[Canada Act 1982]] (UK) and [[Constitution Act 1982]] (Canada), which included a constitutional amendment process, the UK ceased to have any legislative authority whatsoever over Canada.

By the 1930s and the outbreak of World War II, Canada's [[naturalization]] laws consisted of a hodgepodge of confusing acts,&lt;ref name=CIC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/legacy/index.asp| title=Forging Our Legacy: Canadian Citizenship And Immigration, 1900–1977| publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada| accessdate=17 July 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626135503/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/legacy/index.asp| archivedate=26 June 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which still retained the term "British subject" as the nationality and citizenship of "Canadian nationals". This eventually conflicted with the nationalism that arose following the [[First World War|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, and the accompanying desire to have the Dominion of Canada's sovereign status reflected in distinct national symbols (such as flags, [[national anthem|anthem]], [[Seal (emblem)|seal]], etc.).&lt;ref name=CIC22&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/legacy/chap-5.asp#chap5-1| title=Forging Our Legacy: Canadian Citizenship And Immigration, 1900–1977 – The growth of Canadian nationalism| publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada| accessdate=17 July 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610200013/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/publications/legacy/chap-5.asp#chap5-1| archivedate=10 June 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, plus the muddled nature of existing nationality law, prompted the enactment of the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946]], which took effect on 1 January 1947. On that date, Canadian citizenship was conferred on British subjects who were born, naturalized or domiciled in Canada. Subsequently, on 1 April 1949, the Act was extended to Newfoundland, upon the former British Dominion joining the Canadian confederation as the [[Newfoundland and Labrador|province of Newfoundland]].

The 1947 Act was substantially revised again on 15 February 1977, when the new Citizenship Act came into force. From that date, [[multiple citizenship]] became legal. However, those who had lost Canadian citizenship before that date did not automatically have it restored until 17 April 2009, when Bill C-37 became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2008/04/legislation-restore-citizenship-lost-canadians-passes.html?=undefined&amp;wbdisable=true| title=Legislation to restore citizenship to lost Canadians passes| date=16 April 2008| publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 act also limited the issuance of citizenship to children born outside Canada to Canadian ancestors (''[[jus sanguinis]]'') to one generation abroad.&lt;ref name="CICrules" /&gt; Bill C-24 in 2015 further granted Canadian citizenship to British subjects with ties to Canada but who did not qualify for Canadian citizenship in 1947 (either because they had lost British subject status prior to 1947, or did not qualify for Canadian citizenship in 1947 and had not yet applied for naturalization).&lt;ref name="CICrules" /&gt;

==Summary of acquisition of Canadian citizenship==
There are four ways an individual can acquire Canadian citizenship: by birth on Canadian soil; by descent (being born to a Canadian parent); by grant (naturalization); and by adoption. Among them, only citizenship by birth is granted automatically with limited exceptions, while citizenship by descent or adoption is acquired automatically if the specified conditions have been met. Citizenship by grant, on the other hand, must be approved by the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship.

==Canadian citizenship by birth in Canada==
In general, persons born in Canada on or after 1 January 1947 (or 1 April 1949 if born in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]) automatically acquire Canadian citizenship at birth unless they fall into one of the exceptions listed below. Those born in Canada before 1947 automatically acquired Canadian citizenship either on 1 January 1947 (or 1 April 1949 for Newfoundland and Labrador residents) if they were British subjects on that day, or on 11 June 2015 if they had involuntarily lost their British subject status before that day.

Despite being [[aboriginal Canadians|indigenous peoples in Canada]], many [[First Nations]] peoples (legally known as [[Status Indians]]) and [[Inuit]] born before 1947 did not acquire Canadian citizenship until 1956, when only those who met the conditions were retroactively granted Canadian citizenship.

===Current legislation===
Under paragraph 3(1)(a) of the 1977 Act, any person who was born in Canada on or after 15 February 1977 acquires Canadian citizenship at birth. The Interpretation Act states that the term "Canada" not only includes Canadian soil, but also "the internal waters" and "the territorial sea" of Canada, with the term "internal waters" being defined as including "the airspace above".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpretation Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21)|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-21/page-4.html#h-30|website=Justice.gc.ca|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, [[Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] considers all children who were born over Canadian airspace as Canadian citizens.&lt;ref name="acquisition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Acquisition of citizenship|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/acquisition.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 2008 case, a girl born to a Ugandan mother aboard a [[Northwest Airlines]] flight from Amsterdam to Boston was deemed a Canadian citizen because she was born over [[Canadian airspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baby girl born on US-bound flight|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7807001.stm|accessdate=23 April 2017|agency=[[BBC]]|date=1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the interpretation section of the Citizenship Act states that any person who was born on an aircraft registered in Canada, or a vessel registered in Canada, is considered to be born in Canada.

There are only three exceptions to this rule, which are listed below.

===Exceptions===
Subsection 3(2) of the Act states that Canadian citizenship by birth in Canada is not granted to a child born in Canada if neither parent is a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, and either parent was recognized by [[Global Affairs Canada]] as employed by the following at the time of the child's birth:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subsection 3(2) of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-29|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-29/page-1.html#h-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* a foreign government in Canada,
* an employee of the foreign government in Canada, or,
* a foreign organization which enjoys diplomatic immunity in Canada, including the [[United Nations]].

In the Vavilov decision, the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] clarified that to qualify for one of the exceptions, the parent's status as an employee of a foreign government ''must'' be recognized first by Global Affairs Canada. The exceptions do not apply if the said parent is employed by a foreign state but never had that status recognized by the federal government.

In a high-profile 2015 case, [[Deepan Budlakoti]], a stateless man born in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], was declared not to be a Canadian citizen because his parents were employed as domestic staffs by the High Commissioner of India in Canada and their contracts, which came with recognized diplomatic statuses, legally ended two months after his birth, despite the fact that they started to work for a non-diplomat well before their contracts ended and before Budlakoti was born.&lt;ref name="stateless" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Budlakoti v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)|link=|year=2014|court=fct|num=855|format=fc|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=9 September 2014|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous legislation===
Under section 4 and 5 the 1947 Act, all persons who were born on Canadian soil or a ship registered in Canada on or after 1 January 1947 acquired Canadian citizenship at birth, while those who were born before 1 January 1947 on Canadian soil or Canadian ships acquired Canadian citizenship on 1 January 1947 if they had not yet lost their [[British subject]] status on that day. This Act was amended to include Newfoundland in 1949.&lt;ref name="oldlaw" /&gt;

Before 1950, a loophole existed in a way that section 5 of the 1947 Act did not mention any exceptions to this rule for persons born after 1947, making persons born to diplomats between this period also Canadian citizens by birth. This loophole was closed in 1950 when the first amendments to the 1947 Act went into effect, which specified that the ''jus soli'' rule does not apply to children with a "responsible parent" (father if born in wedlock; mother if born out of wedlock or has custody of the child) who was not a permanent resident and who also was:&lt;ref name="1952Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Citizenship Act, R.S.C., 1952, c.33|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.castatutes/rsofnad0002&amp;size=2&amp;collection=castatutes&amp;id=201|website=HeinOnline|publisher=[[Queen's Printer for Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a diplomatic or consular officer; 
* an employee of a foreign government; or,
* a person employed by a diplomatic or consular officer.

Hence, between 1950 and 1977, it was possible for children born to foreign diplomat fathers and Canadian mothers not to be Canadian citizens.

===First Nations and Inuit===
Although the 1947 Act declared that British subjects who were born in Canada prior to 1947 acquired Canadian citizenship on 1 January 1947, [[First Nations]] and [[Inuit]] were left out of the 1947 Act because those who were born before 1 January 1947 were not British subjects.&lt;ref name="1952Act" /&gt; It was not until 1956 when the legal loophole was closed by amending the 1947 Act to include [[Status Indians]] under the [[Indian Act]] and Inuit who were born prior to 1947. To be eligible for Canadian citizenship, they must have had Canadian domicile on 1 January 1947 and must have had resided in Canada for over ten years on 1 January 1956. Those qualified were deemed to be Canadian citizens from 1 January 1947.&lt;ref name="1970Act" /&gt; In comparison, those born on or after 1 January 1947 acquired Canadian citizenship at birth on the same basis as any other person born in Canada.

===Proposed abolition===
In 2012, Citizenship and Immigration Minister [[Jason Kenney]] proposed to modify the ''[[jus soli]]'' birthright citizenship recognized in Canadian law as a means of discouraging [[birth tourism]]. The move had drawn criticism from experts who said that the proposal was based on overhyped popular beliefs and nonexistent data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brean|first1=Joseph|title=Tory crackdown on ‘birth tourists’ will eliminate Canadian passport babies|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/passport-babies-canada|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=[[National Post]]|publisher=Postmedia Network|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, however, Minister [[John McCallum]] said during an interview that there is no plan to end birthright citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Kathleen|title=Petition to Parliament calls for end to automatic citizenship to end 'birth tourism'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/birth-tourism-canada-epetition-1.3816629|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=[[CBC News]]|date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automatic grant of Canadian citizenship for persons born in Canada before 1947===
The 2015 amendment (Bill C-24) of the 1977 Act, which went into effect on 11 June 2015, granted Canadian citizenship for the first time to people who were born in Canada before 1 January 1947 (or 1 April 1949 if born in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]), ceased to be [[British subject]]s before that day, and never became Canadian citizens after 1947 (or 1949). Under the 1947 Act, these people were never considered to be Canadian citizens because they had lost their British subject status before the creation of Canadian citizenship. Persons who had voluntarily renounced British subject status or had their British subject status revoked are not included in the grant.&lt;ref name="loss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loss of Canadian citizenship and British subject status, and acquisition and restoration of Canadian citizenship|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/loss-canadian-british-subject-status-acquisition-restoration-canadian.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian citizenship by descent==
Whether a person is a Canadian citizen by descent depends on the legislation at the time of birth. Generally speaking, any person who was born to a parent born or naturalized in Canada who has not actively renounced their Canadian citizenship is a Canadian citizen by descent (known as first generations born abroad), regardless of the time of birth. These persons either automatically acquired Canadian citizenship at birth, or on 17 April 2009 or 11 June 2015.

Cases for children of first generations born abroad (known as second and subsequent generations born abroad) are more complicated. For such persons, only those who were born on or before 16 April 2009 may be Canadian citizens.

===Current legislation===
Under Bill C-37 which went into force on 17 April 2009, every person born outside of Canada as the first generation born abroad (i.e., born to a Canadian parent who derives their citizenship from birth or naturalization in Canada) on or after 17 April 2009 is automatically a Canadian citizen by descent at birth. The Bill also granted Canadian citizenship, for the first time, to children of former Canadian citizens whose citizenship was restored on that day (which was every person who involuntarily lost Canadian citizenship under the 1947 Act). On 11 June 2015, Bill C-24 further granted Canadian citizenship by descent to children of British subjects who were born or naturalized in Canada but never had Canadian citizenship. The acquisition of citizenship under both bills is not retroactive to birth.&lt;ref name="acquisition" /&gt;

Children born abroad on or after 17 April 2009 to Canadian citizens by descent, and children born abroad to Canadian citizens by descent who acquired their citizenship ''en masse'' on 17 April 2009 or 11 June 2015 are subject to the first generation rule and hence are ''not'' Canadian citizens. They must go through the naturalization or adoption process to become Canadian citizens.&lt;ref name="acquisition" /&gt;

The exceptions to the first-generation rule are:&lt;ref name="acquisition" /&gt;
*the parent, who is a Canadian citizen by descent, is employed by the federal or provincial government (including Canadian Forces) at the time of the child's birth, or,
*the grandparent, who is a Canadian citizen by descent, is employed by the federal or provincial government (including Canadian Forces) at the time of the child's parent's birth.

====2009 amendments to the Act====

An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (S.C. 2008, c. 14) (previously Bill C-37)&lt;ref name="CICrules" /&gt; came into effect on 17 April 2009&lt;ref&gt;See the Executive summary of the [http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2009/2009-04-15/html/sor-dors108-eng.html REGULATIONS AMENDING THE CITIZENSHIP REGULATIONS, 1993 (SOR/2009-108)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002053218/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2009/2009-04-15/html/sor-dors108-eng.html |date=2 October 2013 }}. The Act to amend the Citizenship Act itself states (sec. 14): "The provisions of this Act, other than section 13, come into force on a day or days to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council, but no later than 365 days after the day on which this Act receives royal assent." [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2008_14/ Royal assent was given] on 17 April 2008. No Order in Council appears to have been made.&lt;/ref&gt; and changed the rules for Canadian citizenship. Individuals born outside of Canada are Canadian citizens by descent only if one of their parents is a citizen of Canada either by having been born in Canada or by naturalization. The new law limits citizenship by descent to one generation born outside Canada.

In a scenario, the new rules would apply like this: A child is born in [[Brazil]] in 2005 (''before'' the new rules came into effect) to a Canadian citizen father, who himself is a born abroad citizen by descent, and a Brazilian mother who is only a Permanent Resident of Canada. The child automatically becomes a Canadian citizen at birth. Another child born ''after'' 17 April 2009 in the same scenario would not be considered a Canadian citizen. The child is considered born past "first generation limitation" and the parents would have to sponsor the child to become a Permanent Resident. Once permanent residency is granted, a parent can apply for Canadian citizenship on behalf of the child under subsection 5(2) without the residency requirement.&lt;ref name="CICrules" /&gt;

Children born on or after 17 April 2009 as second and subsequent generations born abroad have no claim to Canadian citizenship other than naturalization or adoption. Before Bill C-6's passage on 19 June 2017, such children might be [[statelessness|stateless]] if without claim to any other citizenship. In one case, a toddler who was born in Beijing out of wedlock to a Chinese mother and a Canadian father who acquired his citizenship by descent was left ''de facto'' stateless for 14 months until she was registered for [[Irish citizenship]] because of her Irish-born grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High-flying professionals producing a generation of stateless children|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/high-flying-professionals-producing-a-generation-of-stateless-children|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=National Post|agency=Reuters|publisher=Postmedia Network|date=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although the child qualifies for Chinese nationality under Chinese nationality law, she was not able to be registered as a Chinese national (i.e., registered in her parent's [[hukou|household register]]) because [http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/931023.shtml her parents were not married at the time of her birth.]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 19 June 2017, parents of otherwise stateless children can apply for naturalization on the sole ground of being stateless without fulfilling any of the requirements for citizenship.

===Previous provisions===
Between 15 February 1977 and 16 April 2009, a child of a Canadian citizen who was born abroad acquires Canadian citizenship automatically at birth, regardless of whether the parent was a Canadian citizen by descent.&lt;ref name="retention"&gt;{{cite web|title=Retention of citizenship prior attaining 28 years old|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/retention-prior-attaining-28-years-old.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the parent must be a Canadian citizen at the time of their birth for them to be eligible for Canadian citizenship, hence those with a parent who involuntarily lost their citizenship under the 1947 Act were not considered as Canadian citizens.

However, a Canadian citizen who was born outside Canada after the first generation between 15 February 1977 and 16 April 1981 is required to apply for retention of Canadian citizenship before their 28th birthday. Otherwise, their Canadian citizenship would be automatically lost.&lt;ref name="retention" /&gt;

Between 1947 and 1977, a person born to a Canadian citizen parent would only acquire Canadian citizenship if his or her birth was registered at a Canadian embassy, consulate or high commission. Canadian citizenship between this period could only be passed down by Canadian fathers when born in wedlock, or Canadian mothers when born out of wedlock.&lt;ref name="oldlaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Citizenship Act, 1947, 10 Geo. VI.|url=http://www.pier21.ca/research/immigration-history/canadian-citizenship-act-1947|publisher=Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 1947 Act had mandated that a child must be registered within two years from the date of the child's birth, the 1977 Act abolished the mandatory registration period so that eligible persons and their children born before 1977 could be registered at any age after 15 February 1977 up until 14 August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proof and certificates of citizenship: Delayed registration of birth outside Canada|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/proof/delayed-registration-birth-outside-canada.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision, known as delayed registration, was retroactive to birth, so children born to these citizens would automatically acquire Canadian citizenship by descent if born between the period of 15 February 1977 to 16 April 2009 and would have to apply for retention if falling under the retention rules (i.e., born between 1977 and 1981).&lt;ref name="retention" /&gt;

Although married women were unable to pass down citizenship to their offspring under the 1947 Act, a provision in the 1977 Act (paragraph 5(2)(b)), before it was repealed on 17 April 2009, also allowed children born to Canadian mothers in wedlock before 1977 to apply for Canadian citizenship through a special grant before 14 August 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship Act  R.S.C., 1985, c. C-29 (Version of document from 2002-12-31 to 2003-03-31)|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-29/20021231/P1TT3xt3.html|website=Justice Laws Website|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the delayed registration, the grant of citizenship under this provision was ''not'' retroactive to birth, and hence children born to such parents would ''not'' be Canadian citizens by descent if they were born before their parents' citizenship was granted, because the parents were not yet Canadian citizens at the time of their birth. The special grant was also available for children who were born to Canadian fathers out of wedlock between the period of 17 May and 14 August 2004. Those who were born after the parent's citizenship was granted also had to apply for retention if falling under the retention rules.&lt;ref name="retention" /&gt;

Those who failed to register or apply for a grant before 14 August 2004 would see their citizenship granted on 17 April 2009 if they were the first generation born abroad. Unlike those registered for or granted citizenship before the 2004 deadline, however, their children will not be able to acquire Canadian citizenship by descent, regardless of the time of birth.

==Canadian citizenship through naturalization==
A person may apply for Canadian citizenship by naturalization under section 5 of the Act if the outlined conditions are met. In certain cases, some or all of the requirements may be waived by the Minister.

===General provision===
Under subsection 5(1), a person of any age may apply for Canadian citizenship if he or she:&lt;ref name="citiapp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Determine your eligibility – Citizenship|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/eligibility.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, any applicant between the age of 18 and 54 must:&lt;ref name="citiapp" /&gt;

* demonstrate sufficient knowledge in English or French, either by passing a language test (administered by the federal or provincial government, or a third party), or providing transcripts that indicate the completion of secondary or post-secondary education in English or French.

Subsection 5(1) does not apply to minors with a Canadian citizen parent or guardian, who must follow subsection 5(2) which has fewer requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application for Canadian Citizenship: Adults - Subsection 5(1)|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/application-canadian-citizenship-adults.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 2015's Bill C-24, the ''Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act'', the requirement for time spent in Canada was 1095 days over four years including at least two as a permanent resident (time spent in Canada as a temporary resident could count as one year of residence at most). The language and knowledge requirement applied only to persons aged 18 to 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archived - Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act: A comparative view|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2014/02/strengthening-canadian-citizenship-act-comparative-view.html?=undefined&amp;wbdisable=true|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 17 June 2015 and 11 October 2017, the physical residence period was prolonged to four out of six years, and applicants must spend more than 183 days in Canada each year for at least four years before the day they submit their application. Their time spent in Canada as a temporary resident or a protected person also did not count toward the residence period.

Applications submitted before 11 October 2017 were subject to the longer physical residence requirement. However, knowledge and language requirements no longer apply to persons who were under 18 or over 54 at the time they signed their application, even when their applications were submitted before that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship grants: Applicants 55 years of age or older|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/grant/applicants-55-years-older-applications-received-june-11-2015.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age requirement and the requirement to declare the applicant's intention to reside in Canada or continue the service with the CAF has been repealed when Bill C-6 became law on 19 June 2017. Before this date, only those over 18 can apply for naturalization under subsection 5(1).&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt; Furthermore, the residence period was changed to three out of five years on 11 October 2017, and applicants are no longer required to reside in Canada for 183 days per year. Once again, time spent as a temporary resident or a protected person is allowed to count toward the period of permanent residence, and the language and knowledge tests no longer apply to persons under 18 or over 54.

All applicants are required to maintain the requirements for citizenship from the day they submit the applications to the day they take the oath.&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt;

===Special provision for children with a Canadian parent or guardian===

Since 19 June 2017, a minor under 18 can apply for citizenship individually under subsection 5(1) if they meet all requirements. In other circumstances, however, the minor child's parent or guardian can apply for Canadian citizenship on their behalf under subsection 5(2). Citizenship will be granted under subsection 5(2) if:&lt;ref name="citiapp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide CIT 0003 - Application for Canadian Citizenship - Minors (under 18 years of age)|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-0003-application-canadian-citizenship-minors-under-18-years.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the child is a [[Permanent resident (Canada)|permanent resident]]; and,
* a parent of the child is a Canadian citizen or is in the process of applying for Canadian citizenship.

The parent who applies on the child's behalf does not have to be the one with Canadian citizenship. For example, a permanent resident child's non-citizen father can apply for citizenship on their behalf if the mother of the child is a Canadian citizen.&lt;ref name="citiapp" /&gt;

The period of residence requirement does not apply to those applying under subsection 5(2).&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt; Minors under 14 years old also do not need to take the oath of citizenship or attend a citizenship ceremony.

Applicants who submitted their applications before 11 October 2017 are no longer required to meet language and knowledge requirements as they no longer apply to any person under 18 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship grants: Minors applying under subsection5(2)|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/grant/minors.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stateless children of Canadian citizens by descent===
When Bill C-37 became law in 2009, a new provision, subsection 5(5), was also added to provide a path to citizenship for stateless children born to Canadian parents who acquired citizenship by descent. To qualify, the applicants must:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizenship grants: Statelessness|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/grant/statelessness.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* be born outside Canada on or after 1 April 2009;
* have at least one parent who is a Canadian citizen by descent;
* meet the residency requirement (1,095 days in four years);
* have been stateless since birth (i.e., cannot have a claim to citizenship of another country, and cannot renounce or lose the citizenship of another country); and,
* be less than 23 years of age at the time of application.

Unlike subsections 5(1) and 5(2), subsection 5(5) does not require the applicant to hold permanent resident status to apply (as long as the residence requirement has been met). Additionally, they do not need to attend a ceremony or take the Oath of Citizenship. Other conditions, such as the income tax filing, also do not apply to them.

After 19 June 2017, it is possible for such children to apply for a discretionary grant under subsection 5(4) on the sole ground of being stateless and bypass all requirements, although subsection 5(5) is left intact as a part of the Act.&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt;

===Compassionate cases===
Under subsection 5(3), the Minister may waive the following requirements on compassionate or humanitarian grounds:

* the language requirement; and,
* the requirement of taking the Canadian Citizenship Test.

The Minister may further waive the oath requirement for persons with disabilities.

Moreover, under subsection 5(4), the Minister may grant citizenship to individuals who:&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt;

* are subject to "special and unusual hardship";
* have rendered services "of an exceptional value to Canada"; or,
* are stateless.

Such persons do not need to fulfill any of the requirements.

===Citizenship ceremonies===
{{Main|Oath of Citizenship (Canada)}}
All applicants for naturalization aged 14 or over (except for those naturalizing under subsection 5(5) or those with the requirement waived by the minister) must attend a citizenship ceremony as the final stage of their application. After taken the Oath of Citizenship, they will be given a paper citizenship certificate as the legal proof of Canadian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prepare for the citizenship ceremony|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-ceremony.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before February 2012, applicants would receive a wallet-sized citizenship card and a paper commemorative certificate, but only the citizenship card served as the conclusive proof of Canadian citizenship.&lt;ref name="proof1"/&gt;

==Canadian citizenship by adoption==

Prior to 2007, there was no provision in the Act for adopted persons to become Canadian citizens without going through the process of immigration and naturalization. In May 2006 the federal government introduced draft legislation, Bill C-14: An Act to Amend the Citizenship Act (Adoption), which was designed to allow adopted children the right to apply for citizenship immediately after the adoption without having to become a permanent resident. This bill received Royal Assent on 22 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=3294583&amp;File=24| title=Bill C-14: An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (adoption) (LS-528E)| publisher=Parl.gc.ca| accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passage of the bill, a person who is adopted by a Canadian citizen is entitled to become a Canadian citizen under section 5.1 of the Citizenship Act if 
* the adoption takes place on or after 1 January 1947 (1 April 1949 for Newfoundland residents); '''or''',
* the adoption took place before 1 January 1947 (or 1 April 1949 for Newfoundland residents) and the adoptive parent became a Canadian citizen on that day; '''and''',
* the adoption follows the applicable laws of both countries; '''and''',
* the adoption is not for the sole purpose of obtaining Canadian citizenship; '''and''',
* the adoptive parent(s) with Canadian citizenship did not acquire their citizenship by descent or adoption (unless falling into one of the exceptions listed below).

In addition, for adoptees over 18 years old, evidence must be submitted to show that the adoptive parents and the adoptee have a "genuine relationship between parent and child" before the adoptee turned 18.

For Quebec adopters, the adoption must also be approved by the [[Government of Quebec]].

Unlike the execution of citizenship by descent provisions which automatically grants citizenship to first-generation born abroad, the exercise of adoption provisions is voluntary, and adoptees may become Canadian citizens either by immediately applying for Canadian citizenship under section 5.1 or through naturalization under section 5 after the adoptees become permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Choose a process—Intercountry adoption|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/adopt-child-abroad/processes/choose-process.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, those adopted by one or both parents who derived their citizenship by descent or under the adoption provisions are not eligible for citizenship under section 5.1 and must apply for naturalization under section 5, unless the parent concerned, at the time of adoption,
* is serving in the [[Canadian forces]] or employed by the federal or provincial government; or,
* was born to or adopted by a parent who was serving in the Canadian forces or employed by the federal or provincial government at the time of birth.

Furthermore, those who acquired citizenship under section 5.1 cannot pass down citizenship to their future offspring born outside Canada through ''jus sanguinis'', while an adoptee who acquired citizenship through naturalization may pass down citizenship to future children born abroad.

Although not included in section 5.1, persons who were adopted before 1 January 1947 were also granted Canadian citizenship on 11 June 2015 if their adoptive parents can pass down citizenship by descent and they had never received Canadian citizenship.&lt;ref name="CICrules" /&gt;

In a 2013 case, the Federal Court ruled that a person applying under section 5.1 has an ''entitlement'' to Canadian citizenship if all criteria have been met, even when they are otherwise ineligible for citizenship under naturalization rules (e.g., criminal offences or outstanding deportation orders).

==Retention of Canadian citizenship==
===Current legislation===
There is no longer a requirement to file for retention of Canadian citizenship before a person's 28th birthday after the repeal of section 8 of the Act on 17 April 2009.&lt;ref name="CICrules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes to citizenship rules|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/improvements/act-changes-2009-2015.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada|access-date=3 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204061352/https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/improvements/act-changes-2009-2015.html#|archive-date=4 December 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical provisions===
====Under the 1977 Act====
Prior to Bill C-37 entered into force, all Canadians who acquired their Canadian citizenship by descent through a Canadian parent who also acquired Canadian citizenship by descent (known as the second and subsequent generations born abroad) would automatically lose their Canadian citizenship on their 28th birthday under section 8 of the 1977 Act, unless they applied for retention of citizenship.

Retention of citizenship would only be approved for applicants who had satisfied one of the following conditions:&lt;ref name="retention" /&gt;

* they had resided in Canada for over one year immediately before the application prior to attaining 28 years of age; or,
* they had provided proof of "substantial connections" with Canada between the age of 14 and 28 (including English and French language test results, proof of attendance at a Canadian school, or proof of employment of the federal or provincial government).

Applications would be considered by a citizenship judge and, if rejected, could be filed again after the applicant had met the requirements. Successful applicants would be issued a citizenship card and a certificate of retention, and both serve as the legal proof of citizenship.&lt;ref name="retention" /&gt;

This provision was formally repealed on 17 April 2009 when Bill C-37 came into effect, and those who attained 28 years of age on or after the date no longer has a requirement to retain citizenship. Thus, only those who were born between the period of 15 February 1977 (the day that the 1977 Act went into effect) and 16 April 1981 were required to retain citizenship and, if had not taken steps to do so, would lose their Canadian citizenship between 15 February 2005 and 16 April 2009. However, a child born to such parent would still be a Canadian citizen and no longer had to apply for retention, if he or she was born after 16 April 1981 but before 17 April 2009 and the parent had not formally lost Canadian citizenship at the time of the child's birth. The parent, nevertheless, would face the loss of citizenship if he or she had not successfully filed for retention.

The retention clause of the Act had negatively affected a number of people, many of whom were residing in Canada at the time when their citizenship was stripped. On 4 December 2016, the [[Vancouver Sun]] reported that some individuals who were subject to the automatic loss of citizenship had only discovered that they were no longer Canadian citizens while dealing with the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Karstens-Smith|first1=Jemma|title=University class takes on case of B.C. woman stripped of citizenship|url=http://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/university-class-takes-on-case-of-b-c-woman-stripped-of-citizenship|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=Vancouver Sun|agency=The Canadian Press|publisher=Postmedia Network|date=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people would become ''[[de jure]]'' stateless if also holding no other nationalities or citizenship, and would also have no legal immigration status in Canada after the loss of citizenship. Accordingly, they must take steps to restore their Canadian citizenship under section 11 of the Act.&lt;ref name="retention" /&gt; It is worth noting that neither Bill C-37 nor Bill C-24 restored these persons' citizenship, and those affected must take voluntary action or may face legal consequences as illegal immigrants with respect to the [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]].

====Under the 1947 Act====
Under section 6 the original 1947 Act in force until 1970, Canadian citizens by descent were required to renounce all foreign citizenship and make a declaration of retention after they attained 21 years of age. Failing to do so before their 22nd birthday would cause the loss of Canadian citizenship on that day.&lt;ref name="1952Act" /&gt;

This requirement was relaxed in 1970. Subsection 5(2) of the 1947 Act, as amended in 1970, specified that Canadian citizens by descent would not lose their Canadian citizenship until their 24th birthday, as opposed to their 22nd birthday under the original clause. Retention of citizenship would be granted to any person who had Canadian domicile on their 21st birthday or those who had submitted a declaration of retention of Canadian citizenship before their 24th birthday. The requirement for them to renounce their foreign citizenship under the original 1947 Act was also repealed.&lt;ref name="1970Act" /&gt;

Unlike that of the 1977 Act which required the affected persons to make an application with the possibility of being refused, the 1947 Act's retention clauses merely required those affected to make a declaration. The clauses also did not make a distinction between the first-generation born abroad to Canada-born or naturalized parents, and second and subsequent generations born abroad. However, under Bill C-37, only those who were the first generation born abroad were able to have their Canadian citizenship restored, while second and subsequent generations born abroad remain foreign if they had failed to retain their Canadian citizenship under the 1947 Act.&lt;ref name="CICrules" /&gt;

The complete replacement of the 1947 Act in 1977 meant that only those who were born on or before 14 February 1953 were subject to the 1947 Act's retention rules. Those born between 15 February 1953 and 14 February 1977 were able to retain their Canadian citizenship without taking any actions.

==Loss of Canadian citizenship==
{{see also|History of Canadian nationality law}}

===Involuntary loss of citizenship===
Since Bill C-37 came into force in 2009, there is no provision for involuntary loss of Canadian citizenship, except when in certain circumstances the Minister may [[denaturalization|revoke a person's citizenship]].

Between 1947 and 1977, a number of Canadian citizens had involuntarily lost their citizenship under the 1947 Act, mostly by acquiring the nationality or citizenship of another country.&lt;ref name="loss" /&gt; These persons' citizenship have been restored en masse on 17 April 2009.

Under the 1977 Act, there were no automatic losses of Canadian citizenship until the period between 2005 and 2009 when some Canadians lost their citizenship due to their failure to file for retention of citizenship.

While there now are no grounds for involuntary loss of citizenship, voluntary loss of citizenship, or renunciation, is permitted.

====Lost Canadians and involuntary loss of citizenship under the 1947 Act====
{{main|Lost Canadians}}
The term "Lost Canadians" are used to refer to persons who believed themselves to be Canadian citizens but have lost or never acquired Canadian citizenship due to the legal hurdles in the 1947 Act.

Under the 1947 Act, a person must be a [[British subject]] on 1 January 1947 for them to acquire Canadian citizenship. Hence certain persons who were born, naturalized or domiciled in Canada before the enactment of the 1947 Act were ineligible for Canadian citizenship, which included the following groups:&lt;ref name="loss" /&gt;

* Any person born, naturalized or domiciled in Canada who had lost their British subject status on or before 31 December 1946 (mostly by naturalizing in a country outside the [[British Empire]]);
* Any person born, naturalized or domiciled in Newfoundland who had lost their British subject status on or before 31 March 1949, unless they already acquired Canadian citizenship;
* Any woman who had married a non-British subject man between 22 May 1868 and 14 January 1932 (loss was automatic even when the woman did not acquire her husband's citizenship);
* Any women who had married a non-British subject between 15 January 1932 and 31 December 1946 when she acquired her husband's nationality; and,
* First Nations and Inuit.

After the enactment of the 1947 Act, Canadian citizenship could be automatically lost between 1 January 1947 and 14 February 1977, by the following acts:&lt;ref name="loss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1970Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Citizenship Act. R.S.C. 1970, c. C-19|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.castatutes/edstada0001&amp;size=2&amp;collection=castatutes&amp;id=1091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* voluntarily (i.e., other than marriage) acquiring citizenship of any other country, including a Commonwealth country (loss of citizenship would happen even when the acquisition of another citizenship took place on Canadian soil);
* absenting from Canada for over six years (unless qualified for an exemption) for naturalized Canadians (before 1953) or ten years (before 1967);
* loss of citizenship of the responsible parent (father when born in wedlock; mother when born out of wedlock or when having custody) when the person was a minor (only when he or she is a citizen of another country or has received foreign citizenship along with the parent); or,
* if not residing in Canada, failing to apply for retention of Canadian citizenship before the age of 24 (for persons born outside Canada before 15 February 1953) or 22 (for those born in 1948 or earlier).

The loss of British subject status or Canadian citizenship could occur even when the person was physically in Canada.

Certain Canadian residents born before 1977, including but not limiting to [[war bride]]s and persons who were born outside Canada to Canadian citizens (primarily those who were born to Canadian servicemen or in U.S. hospitals along the [[Canada–United States border]] who automatically acquired [[U.S. citizenship]] at birth), also do not possess Canadian citizenship, because it was not possible to automatically acquire Canadian citizenship between 1947 and 1977 without voluntarily applying for naturalization (for war brides) or registering at a Canadian mission (for children of Canadians). Some of those people have been living in Canada for their entire lives with little knowledge of their lack of Canadian citizenship. To solve this problem, the federal government had undertaken several legislative processes to reduce and eliminate these cases.

The problem first arose in February 2007, when the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration held hearings on so-called [[Lost Canadians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteeHome.aspx?Lang=1&amp;PARLSES=391&amp;JNT=0&amp;SELID=e22_.1&amp;STAC=1871531&amp;SourceId=| title=CIMM – Loss of Canadian Citizenship for the years 1947, 1977 and 2007 – Committees of the House of Commons| publisher=Cmte.parl.gc.ca| accessdate=25 January 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114184314/http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteeHome.aspx?Lang=1&amp;PARLSES=391&amp;JNT=0&amp;SELID=e22_.1&amp;STAC=1871531&amp;SourceId=#| archive-date=14 November 2007| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found out on applying for passports that, for various reasons, they may not be Canadian citizens as they thought. Don Chapman, a witness before the committee, estimated that 700,000 Canadians had either lost their citizenship or were at risk of having it stripped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maughan|first1=Chris|title=Children of soldiers among 'Lost Canadians'|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/02/26/children_of_soldiers_among_lost_canadians.html|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=[[Toronto Star]]|agency=The Canadian Press|date=26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Citizenship and Immigration Minister [[Diane Finley]] said her office had just 881 calls on the subject. On 19 February 2007, she granted citizenship to 33 such individuals. Some of the people affected reside in towns near the border, and hence were born in American hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/02/20/border-babies.html| work=CBC News| title=Manitoba 'border babies' officially become Canadians| date=20 February 2007| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223053806/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/02/20/border-babies.html| archivedate=23 February 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, particularly Mennonites, were born to Canadian parents outside Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20070220_105827_10432| title=The hunt for lost Canadians| publisher=Macleans.ca – Features| date=20 February 2007| accessdate=25 January 2011| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222042206/http://www.macleans.ca/canada/national/article.jsp?content=20070220_105827_10432| archivedate=22 February 2012| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation by the CBC, based on [[census in Canada|Canadian census]] data, concluded that the problem could affect an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 individuals residing in Canada at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/19/passports-finlay.html| work=CBC News| title=450 'lost Canadians' caught in passport glitch: Finley| date=19 February 2007| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403124933/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/02/19/passports-finlay.html| archivedate=3 April 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2007, Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [[Diane Finley]] announced her proposal to amend the 1977 Act for the first time. Under the proposal, which eventually became Bill C-37, anyone naturalized in Canada since 1947 would have citizenship even if they lost it under the 1947 Act. Also, anyone born since 1947 outside the country to a Canadian mother or father, in or out of wedlock, would have citizenship if they are the first generation born abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Under Bill C-37 and Bill C-24 which went into effect on 17 April 2009 and 11 June 2015, respectively, Canadian citizenship was restored or granted for those who have involuntarily lost their Canadian citizenship under the 1947 Act or British subject status before 1947, as well as their children.

The aftermath of the 1947 Act continues to affect people today. In July 2017, [[Larissa Waters]], an [[Australian Senator]] born in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], was disqualified on the ground that she has dual Canadian and [[Australian citizenship]]. [[Section 44 of the Australian Constitution]] was frequently interpreted by Australian courts as a ban on the ability to run for political office by persons with multiple citizenship. Waters, who was born to Australian parents a week before the 1977 Act went into effect, claimed that she was unaware of the changes in Canadian legislation and was also misinformed by her parents, who told her that she would cease to be a Canadian when she turns 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement from Senator Larissa Waters|url=http://larissa-waters.greensmps.org.au/larissa-statement|website=GreensMPs|publisher=Australian Green Party|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her claim runs afoul with nationality laws of both countries.&lt;ref&gt;If Waters were registered as an Australian citizen prior to 15 February 1977, then she would cease to be a Canadian citizen on the day of her registration because Australian law specified that persons born outside Australia to Australian parents do not acquire citizenship at birth, but only when they were registered at an Australian mission. On the other hand, if she were registered on or after that date, she would be a Canadian citizen for life because the retention requirement under the 1947 Act was no longer relevant after its repeal. Even if she lost her citizenship under the 1947 Act, it would still be resumed by Bill C-37 in 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revocation of citizenship and nullification of renunciation===
Under section 10 the Act, the Minister has the power to initiate proceedings to revoke a person's Canadian citizenship or renunciation of citizenship.

====Current legislation====
Under subsection 10(1) of the Act, the Minister may initiate proceedings to revoke a person's citizenship or nullify the person's renunciation of citizenship if they are satisfied that the person has obtained, retained, renounced or resumed citizenship by:&lt;ref name="revocation" /&gt;

* "false representation" (e.g., forging the residence period in Canada);
* fraud; or,
* knowingly concealing material circumstances.

Revocation of citizenship under subsection 10(1) applies typically to naturalized Canadians. However, it may also be applied to those who had retained their citizenship. Persons whose citizenship was revoked may become stateless if they do not have citizenship or nationality of another country at the time of the final decision.&lt;ref name="revocation" /&gt;

Since 11 January 2018, all revocation cases must be decided by the Federal Court unless the person in question explicitly requests the Minister to make the final decision. Otherwise, the Minister no longer has the authority to unilaterally revoke a person's citizenship without going through court proceedings.

After revocation, a person's status in Canada may be a Canadian citizen (for those who renounced their citizenship with fraud), a permanent resident (for those who restored or acquired citizenship with fraud), or a [[foreign national]] with no status in Canada (for other revocations). Those who become foreign nationals will be subject to deportation, while those with permanent resident status may be issued deportation orders by federal courts on the grounds of security, human rights violations, or organized crime.&lt;ref name="revocation" /&gt;

====Previous legislation====
Before 2015, revocation only applied to naturalized citizens, and the Governor in Council must be notified about the revocation without exception.&lt;ref name="revocation" /&gt;

Between 2015 and 2017, the revocation of citizenship became streamlined. More powers were vested in the Department and the Minister, who could unilaterally revoke a person's citizenship without involving the [[Governor in Council]].&lt;ref name="revocation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revocation of citizenship|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/revocation.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the change of procedure, the number of revocation nearly tenfolded when comparing to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dyer|first1=Evan|title=Trudeau government revoking citizenship at much higher rate than Conservatives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/citizenship-revocation-trudeau-harper-1.3795733|accessdate=2 May 2017|work=CBC News|date=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 19 June 2017, subsection 10(2), as amended in 2014 by Bill C-24, added provisions when the Minister could revoke a person's citizenship, including but not limited to:&lt;ref name="revocation"/&gt;

* lifetime imprisonment due to conviction for treason;
* at least five years' imprisonment due to conviction for terrorism in a Canadian court; or,
* at least five years' imprisonment due to conviction for terrorism in a foreign court.

Revocations under subsection 10(2) only applied to those with citizenship or nationality in another country.

The subsection has been formally repealed on that day when Bill C-6 received Royal Assent.&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt; [[Zakaria Amara]], a dual Jordanian-Canadian citizen whose Canadian citizenship was revoked in 2015 because of his involvement in the [[2006 Ontario terrorism plot]], has had his citizenship reinstated when Bill C-6 became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malcolm|first1=Candice|title=Trudeau rewards a terrorist with citizenship|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2017/03/03/trudeau-rewards-a-terrorist-with-citizenship|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amara remains the only person whose citizenship was revoked under subsection 10(2) before it was repealed.

Between 10 July 2017 and 10 January 2018, all revocation clauses in the Act were deemed inoperable until the amendments of the Act took effect on 11 January 2018. This was because that in May 2017, the Federal Court ruled in Hassouna v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) that subsections 10(1), 10(3) and 10(4) violated the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] in a way that they deprived a person's right to a fair hearing. After the suspension of the ruling had lapsed on 10 July 2017, no subsection under section 10 was enforceable until the 2017 amendments to the Act came into effect. On the same day, a federal judge had nullified the citizenship revocation of 312 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ha|first1=Tu Thanh|title=Federal Court voids Canadian citizenship revocation for 312 people|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/federal-court-voids-canadian-citizenship-revocation-for-312-people/article35675424/|accessdate=13 July 2017|agency=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future changes====
The last part of Bill C-6, which is scheduled to take effect in 2018, includes the following changes:&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt;
* IRCC officers will gain the power to seize all documentation relating to the investigation.

===Renunciation of citizenship===
A Canadian citizen who wishes to voluntarily renounce his or her citizenship for any reason must make an application directly to the federal government, and he or she ceases to be a Canadian citizen only after the federal government has approved such request. Renouncing Canadian citizenship to a foreign government (such as by taking the [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|Oath of Allegiance]] to the United States) is not sufficient in itself to be considered as a voluntary renunciation of Canadian citizenship.

In general, there are two forms of renunciations: subsection 9(1) of the Act, for all renunciations, and section 7.1 of the Citizenship Regulations, for persons who acquired citizenship in 2009 and 2015 due to the changes of law.

All renunciations are subject to approval by the Governor in Council, who has the power to refuse an application on national security grounds.

====General renunciation====
Under subsection 9(1), a person renouncing citizenship must:&lt;ref name="renounce9"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renunciation of citizenship under subsection 9(1) of the Citizenship Act|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/renunciation-under-subsection-9-1-act.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* be 18 or over;
* be a citizen or national of another country;
* reside outside Canada; and,
* understand the implications of renunciation.

The person may be required to attend an interview.

In some cases, the Minister may waive the residence and implication understanding requirements. However, a person may not renounce his or her citizenship when the revocation of citizenship is in action.&lt;ref name="renounce9" /&gt;

====Special renunciation====
Section 7.1 of the Regulations provides a simpler way for those whose citizenship was restored in 2009 and 2015 to renounce their citizenship. To qualify, the applicant must have acquired or reacquired his or her citizenship under the 2009 and 2015 amendments, and:&lt;ref name="renonce7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Renunciation of citizenship under section 7.1 of the Citizenship Regulations|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/renunciation-under-section-7-1-regulations.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* is a citizen of another country; and,
* understands the implications of renunciation.

The implication understanding requirement can also be waived by the Minister.

Persons renouncing under section 7.1 do not need to attend an interview, and there is no fee for renunciation.&lt;ref name="renonce7" /&gt;

==Resumption of Canadian citizenship==
Under subsection 11(1) of the Act, a former Canadian citizen who voluntarily renounced his or her citizenship under Canadian law is generally required to satisfy a number of conditions before he or she can resume Canadian citizenship. The conditions are:&lt;ref name="resumption"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resumption of Canadian citizenship [subsection 11(1)]|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/resumption-canadian-subsection-11-1.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* being a permanent resident;
* having physically been in Canada for no less than 365 days immediately before application; and,
* filing income taxes.

The income taxes and residence intention requirements were added on 11 June 2015 when Bill C-24 became law. The residence intention requirement, however, was repealed on 19 June 2017 when Bill C-6 received Royal Assent.&lt;ref name="c-6" /&gt;

Former citizens who lost their citizenship by revocation are not eligible to resume their citizenship. They must follow naturalization procedures if not permanently prohibited from doing so.&lt;ref name="resumption" /&gt;

===Automatic mass resumption and special grants===
On 17 April 2009, Bill C-37 resumed Canadian citizenship to all of those who have obtained Canadian citizenship on or after 1 January 1947 by birth or naturalization in Canada but have involuntarily lost it under the 1947 Act, and their first generation descendants born abroad were also granted Canadian citizenship on that day.

On 11 June 2015, Bill C-24 further granted citizenship for the first time to those who were born or naturalized in Canada but had lost British subject status before 1947 and their first generation descendants born abroad.&lt;ref name="CICrules" /&gt;

On 22 September 1988, Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] agreed to a redress package for Japanese-Canadians deported from Canada between 1941 and 1946 (about 4,000 in total) and their descendants. The package authorized a special grant of Canadian citizenship for any such person.  All descendants of deported persons were also eligible for the grant of citizenship provided that they were living on 22 September 1988, regardless of whether the person deported from Canada was still alive.

====Women who lost British subject status before 1947====
Although Bill C-24 covered the majority of ex-British subjects who would have acquired citizenship in 1947, a certain number of female ex-British subjects were excluded from the Bill, mainly those born in another part of the [[British Empire]] other than Canada, had been residing in Canada long enough to qualify for citizenship under the 1947 Act, but had lost their British subject status either by marrying a foreign man before 1947, or losing British subject status when her spouse naturalized in another country. These people can acquire Canadian citizenship under subsection 11(2) of the 1977 Act by a simple declaration made to the IRCC. There are no additional requirements other than the declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automatic acquisition of citizenship under subsection 11(2)|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/acquisition-loss/automatic-acquisition-under-subsection-11-2.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple citizenship==
The attitude toward multiple citizenship in Canada has changed significantly over time. Between 1 January 1947 and 14 February 1977, multiple citizenship was only allowed under limited circumstances. On 15 February 1977, the restrictions on multiple citizenship disappeared overnight.

The number of Canadians with multiple citizenship is difficult to determine because of the changes in Canadian and foreign laws. In 2006, around 863,000 Canadian citizens residing in Canada reported in census to hold at least one more citizenship or nationality of another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keung|first1=Nicholas|title=Convenience of dual citizenship serves countries and residents|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2009/10/21/convenience_of_dual_citizenship_serves_countries_and_residents.html|accessdate=3 August 2017|work=Toronto Star|date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual figure, however, is substantially higher, as the federal government does not maintain statistics on persons with multiple citizenship who reside abroad. The ''en masse'' citizenship grant and restoration in 2009 and 2015 further increased the number of Canadians with multiple citizenship, as Canadian citizenship was restored or granted to most of the people who lost their Canadian citizenship or British subject status by acquiring citizenship of another country. These people, as well as their descendants, are ''de jure'' Canadians with multiple citizenship even when they do not exercise citizenship rights (e.g., travelling on a Canadian passport).

Although not a legal requirement, Canadian citizens with multiple citizenship are required to carry a Canadian passport when boarding their flights to Canada since November 2016 unless they are dual Canadian-American citizens carrying a valid United States passport. This is caused by the amended [[visa policy of Canada|visa policy]], which imposed a pre-screening requirement on visa-exempt nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dual Canadian citizens need a valid Canadian passport|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/dual-canadian-citizens-visit-canada.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those entering Canada by land or sea are not subject to this restriction.

===Under the current Act and its amendments===
The 1977 Act removed all restrictions on multiple citizenship and Canadian citizens acquiring another citizenship on or after 15 February 1977 would no longer lose their Canadian citizenship.

Those who lost their Canadian citizenship or British subject status under the 1947 Act or the British 1914 Act regained or gained Canadian citizenship in 2009 and 2015, respectively. The grant and resumption under Bill C-37 and Bill C-24 included these people's children.

===Under the 1947 Act===
Although multiple citizenship was severely restricted under the 1947 Act, it was still possible to be a citizen of Canada and another country so long as the acquisition of the other citizenship or nationality is involuntary. A person may involuntarily acquire citizenship of another country when:&lt;ref name="1952Act" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1970Act" /&gt;

* they were born in a country with ''jus soli'' citizenship law and they were also registered as a Canadian citizen (e.g., the United States);
* they became a citizen of another country because of a change of law in that country (e.g., on 1 January 1949 the United Kingdom conferred [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|Citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies]], or CUKC status, on any person born in the United Kingdom, and these people later became [[British citizen]]s in 1983);
* they acquired the other citizenship by formal marriage to a foreign man (e.g., [[Italian nationality law|Italy]] prior to 1983);
* they were naturalized as a Canadian citizen and did not lose their foreign citizenship under their own country's nationality law (e.g., [[New Zealand nationality law|New Zealand]]).

===Before 1947===
Like peoples of all other British colonies and Dominions at the time, those born in Canada before 1947 were British subjects by nationality under the [[British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]]. The term "Canadian citizen", however, was first created under the Immigration Act 1910 to identify a British subject who was born in Canada or who possessed Canadian domicile, which could be acquired by any British subject who had lawfully resided in Canada for at least three years.&lt;ref name="1910act"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Immigration Act 1910, 9-10 Edward VII, Ch. 27|url=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1910v01cana#page/204/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, "Canadian citizenship" was solely an immigration term and not a nationality term, hence "Canadian citizens" under the Immigration Act would be subject to the same rules on acquisition and loss of British subject status under the [[British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914]].&lt;ref name="1914act"&gt;{{cite web|title=British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914. [4 &amp; 5 GEO. 5. - CH. 17.]|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1914/17/pdfs/ukpga_19140017_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Immigration Act 1910, "Canadian citizenship" would be lost for any person who had ceased to be a British subject, as well as non-Canadian born or naturalized British subjects who "voluntarily [reside] outside Canada".&lt;ref name="1910act" /&gt; While the former would lose "Canadian citizenship" and British subject status simultaneously, the latter would only stop being a "Canadian citizen". Canadian-born or naturalized British subjects would not lose their Canadian domicile by residing outside Canada.

The only circumstance in which a British subject could acquire ''[[de jure]]'' dual citizenship was by birth to a British subject father in a country which offered birthright citizenship (e.g., the United States).&lt;ref name="1914act" /&gt; However, "Canadian citizens" may acquire ''[[de facto]]'' dual citizenship by residing in another British Dominion, protectorate, or colony, as they would simultaneously have "Canadian citizenship" and, if residing long enough to meet the requirements, the domicile of that Dominion, protectorate, or colony.

To further separate British subjects domiciled in Canada from other British subjects, the term "Canadian National" was created by the Canadian Nationals Act 1921 on 3 May of that year. The status was bestowed on all holders of "Canadian citizenship" and their wives, but also included all children born outside Canada to Canadian National fathers, regardless of whether possessing British subject status at the time of birth. This 1921 Act also provided a path for certain Canadian Nationals who were born outside Canada, or who were born in Canada but had the domicile of the United Kingdom or another Dominion at birth or as a minor, to relinquish their Canadian Nationality and domicile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Nationals Act, 11-12 Geo. V, Ch. 4.|url=https://archive.org/stream/actsofparl1921v01cana#page/10/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the passage of the 1921 Act, "Canadian citizens" who were born in Canada had no course to abandon their Canadian domicile without having to relinquish their British subject status altogether. As Canadian Nationality was also independent of their British subject status, the renunciation under the 1921 Act would not affect their British subject status, although they would also not become Canadian citizens on 1 January 1947 when it was first created.

==Judicial review of provisions of current and previous citizenship acts==
===Definition of "residence requirement"===
There have been a number of court decisions dealing with the subject of Canadian citizenship.  In particular, the interpretation of the 3-year (1,095-day) residence requirement enacted by the 1977 ''Citizenship Act'', which does not define the term "residence" and, further, prohibits an appeal of a Federal Court decision in a citizenship matter to the Federal Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, has "led to a great deal of mischief and agony"&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/en/2012/2012fc756/2012fc756.html
|title=Imran v. Canada
|publisher=Federal Court of Canada
|date=14 June 2012
|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generated considerable judicial controversy.

Over the years two principal schools of thought with respect to residence have emerged from the Federal Court.

Early on, in 1978, Associate Chief Justice Arthur L. Thurlow in ''Papadogiorgakis (Re)'', [1978] 2 F.C. 208,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b74410.html
|title=In re Citizenship Act and in re Antonios E. Papadogiorgakis
|publisher=Federal Court of Canada
|date=30 June 1978
|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; opined that residency entails more than a mere counting of days. He held that residency is a matter of the degree to which a person, in mind or fact, settles into or maintains or centralizes his or her ordinary mode of living, including social relations, interests and conveniences. The question becomes whether an applicant's linkages suggest that Canada is his or her home, regardless of any absences from the country.

In ''Re Koo'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Koo (Re)|link=|year=1992|court=fct|num=2417|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1993] 1 FC 286|date=3 December 1992|courtname=auto|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Barbara Reed further elaborated that in residency cases the question before the Court is whether Canada is the country in which an applicant has centralized his or her mode of existence.  Resolving such a question involves consideration of several factors:

{{quote|
# Was the individual physically present in Canada for a long period prior to recent absences which occurred immediately before the application for citizenship?
# Where are the applicant's immediate family and dependents (and extended family) resident?
# Does the pattern of physical presence in Canada indicate a returning home or merely visiting the country?
# What is the extent of the physical absences – if an applicant is only a few days short of the 1095-day total it is easier to find deemed residence than if those absences are extensive?
# Is the physical absence caused by a clearly temporary situation such as employment as a missionary abroad, following a course of study abroad as a student, accepting temporary employment abroad, accompanying a spouse who has accepted temporary employment abroad?
# What is the quality of the connection with Canada: is it more substantial than that which exists with any other country?
}}

The general principle is that the quality of residence in Canada must be more substantial than elsewhere.

In contrast, a line of jurisprudence flowing from the decision in ''Re Pourghasemi (1993)'', 62 F.T.R. 122, 19 Imm. L.R. (2d) 259, emphasized how important it is for a potential new citizen to be immersed in Canadian society and that a person cannot reside in a place where the person is not physically present. Thus, it is necessary for a potential citizen to establish that he or she has been physically present in Canada for the requisite period of time.

In the words of Justice [[Francis C. Muldoon|Francis Muldoon]]:

{{quote|
It is clear that the purpose of paragraph 5(1)(c) is to ensure that everyone who is granted precious Canadian citizenship has become, or at least has been compulsorily presented with the everyday opportunity to become "Canadianized." This happens by "rubbing elbows" with Canadians in shopping malls, corner stores, libraries, concert halls, auto repair shops, pubs, cabarets, elevators, churches, synagogues, mosques and temples – in a word wherever one can meet and converse with Canadians – during the prescribed three years. One can observe Canadian society for all its virtues, decadence, values, dangers and freedoms, just as it is. That is little enough time in which to become Canadianized. If a citizenship candidate misses that qualifying experience, then Canadian citizenship can be conferred, in effect, on a person who is still a foreigner in experience, social adaptation, and often in thought and outlook... So those who would throw in their lot with Canadians by becoming citizens must first throw in their lot with Canadians by residing among Canadians, in Canada, during three of the preceding four years, in order to Canadianize themselves. It is not something one can do while abroad, for Canadian life and society exist only in Canada and nowhere else.
}}

The co-existence of such disparate, yet equally valid approaches has led some judges to comment that the citizenship "law is in a sorry state",&lt;ref&gt;

In 2010 it seemed that a relative judicial consensus with respect to decision-making in residence cases might emerge.  In several Federal Court decisions it was held that the citizenship judge must apply a hybrid two-test approach by firstly ascertaining whether, on [[Legal burden of proof#Preponderance of the evidence|the balance of probabilities]], the applicant has accumulated 1,095 days of physical presence. If so, the residency requirement is considered to have been met.  If not, then the judge must additionally assess the application under the "centralized mode of existence" approach, guided by the non-exhaustive factors set out in ''Koo (Re)''.&lt;ref&gt;

|The [[Federal Court of Appeal]] ruled that the child of a Canadian mother had the right to be granted Canadian citizenship, despite the fact that the responsible parent of the child (i.e. the father) had naturalized as a U.S. citizen before 15 February 1977 and had thus lost his Canadian citizenship.

|The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled that children born abroad before 15 February 1977 of Canadian mothers were to be treated the same as those of Canadian fathers (i.e., granted citizenship upon application without the requirements of a security check or taking a citizenship oath).

|The [[Federal Court of Appeal]] ruled that the Minister had to establish a ''[[bona fide]]'' justification pursuant to section 15(g) of the ''[[Canadian Human Rights Act]]'' for the discriminatory practice in the Act on adoptive parentage, where children born abroad to Canadian citizens obtain "automatic" citizenship while children adopted outside Canada must gain admission to Canada as permanent residents, as mandated by paragraph 5(2)(a ) of the ''Citizenship Act'', which incorporates by reference the requirements imposed by the ''Immigration Act'' pertaining to permanent resident status. However, this case also declared that the [[Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] had overreached itself in declaring that the granting of citizenship was a service customarily available to the general public,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and had breached the rules of [[natural justice]] by failing to notify the Minister that the provisions of the ''Citizenship Act'' were being questioned.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} After the amendment in 2007, most adopted persons now automatically acquire citizenship after the finalization of adoption even when the adoption took place prior to the amendment, and this ruling is no longer relevant.

|The [[Federal Court of Canada]] had ruled in September 2006 that an individual born abroad and out of wedlock to a Canadian serviceman father and a non-Canadian mother acquired citizenship upon arrival in Canada after World War II and did not subsequently lose Canadian citizenship while living abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Taylor v.

However, he was now able to request a grant of citizenship under section 5(4) of the current Act (special cases), and citizenship was subsequently granted in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is Joe Taylor?|url=http://www.canadianwarbrides.com/taylor-joe-bio.asp|publisher=Maven New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The [[Federal Court of Appeal]] ruled that the citizenship officer cannot unreasonably deny a person's citizenship application made under paragraph 5.1(3) if the Quebec government had fully validated the person's adoption, and in order to render a Quebec adoption as an adoption of convenience, the officer must prove, with tangible evidence, that the Quebec legal system was defrauded by the citizenship applicant. The respondent, a Haitian citizen who was adopted by a Quebec man, was deemed as an adoptee by convenience and was denied citizenship under paragraph 5.1(3)(b) when a citizenship officer found that his adoption was not approved by the appropriate department within the Haitian government and he arrived in Canada on a visitor's visa instead of a permanent resident visa, even when the person's adoption was later approved by a Quebec court. The Court of Appeal believed that the officer had failed to validate the genuineness of his adoption by failing to contact with the relevant authorities in Quebec. Hence, there was no evidence to prove that the adoption was indeed an adoption of convenience.

|The [[Federal Court of Appeal]] clarified that for a child to be considered a Canadian citizen by descent, a genetic link must be proven to the Canadian parent through a [[DNA test]]. In this case, a person who was born to a Canadian citizen father outside Canada with assisted human reproduction (AHR) technology but with no genetic links to the father was declared not to be a Canadian citizen by descent.

|The [[Federal Court of Canada]] ruled in a judicial review that subsections 10(1), 10(3) and 10(4) of the Act, all regarding revocation of citizenship, violated subsection 2(e) of the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] in a way that they "[deprived] a person of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice for the determination of his rights and obligations". All eight applicants' revocation notices were quashed, and the three subsections of the Act are deemed inoperable as of 10 July 2017 after the suspension of the ruling has expired.

|The [[Federal Court of Appeal]] ruled that children born in Canada to a parent who is employed by a foreign government, but is not recognized by [[Global Affairs Canada]] as an employee of a foreign government, are Canadian citizens by birth and are not subject to the exceptions under subsection 3(2), because only employees of foreign governments with "diplomatic privileges and immunities certified by the Minister of Foreign Affairs" are exempted from the ''jus soli'' rule. The appellant, a man who was born in Canada to Russian [[sleeper agent]]s, was previously declared not to be a Canadian citizen by the [[Federal Court of Canada]] because his parents, who were arrested in 2010 during [[Illegals Program#Andrey Bezrukov and Yelena Vavilova (Donald Heathfield and Tracey Lee Ann Foley)|a crackdown of Russian agents in the U.S.]], were employees of a foreign government at the time of his birth. Moreover, none of his parents were ever Canadian citizens as they only [[Identity theft|assumed the identities]] of two deceased Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Vavilov v.

On 10 May 2018, the federal government's leave to appeal was granted by the Supreme Court of Canada which will examine whether the man and his elder brother, who won a similar case in April that year, would fall under subsection 3(2) of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supreme Court to decide whether sons of Russian spies are Canadian citizens |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/russian-spy-kids-court-1.4657340 |website=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and responsibilities of citizens==
Comparing to permanent residents, Canadian citizens have additional rights, including but not limited to:
*Obtain [[Canadian passport]]s for travel and seek consular protection when outside Canada, including full consular services offered by Australia under the [[Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]] in certain countries without a Canadian mission. Permanent residents are ineligible for a Canadian passport and must travel with passports issued by their nationalities. They are also not entitled to consular services and must seek protection from their country of nationality.
*Live outside Canada indefinitely while retaining the right to return to Canada. In comparison, permanent residency may be lost if IRCC determined that a permanent resident did not meet the residency obligation in Canada.
*Pass on Canadian citizenship to children born outside Canada (to the first generation only). Children of permanent residents must apply to immigrate to Canada first in order to reside in Canada.
*Avoid [[deportation]] from within Canada. Permanent residents may be subject to deportation orders for violating Canadian laws.
*Vote in [[Elections in Canada|political elections]] on a federal level upon reaching the age of 18 (if qualified under the [[Canada Elections Act]]). Permanent residents are not allowed to vote in federal elections.
*Run for political office upon reaching the age of 18. Permanent residents are not allowed to stand as candidates for any elections.
*Hold certain jobs of federal, provincial or territorial government when citizenship is required. These jobs are usually not open to permanent residents due to the level of security clearance involved.

In addition, only Canadian citizens may petition to receive a grant of armorial bearings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15367&amp;lan=eng |title=Applying for Armorial Bearings |author=Governor General of Canada |authorlink=Governor General of Canada |work=Heraldry |date=2014-08-19 |accessdate=2016-04-24 |quote=All Canadian citizens […] may petition to receive a grant of armorial bearings. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian citizens, however, have the responsibility to complete jury duty when called to do so, and failure to respond or appear may come with legal consequences. Permanent residents, on the other hand, are legally ineligible to serve as jurors and hence are not required to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of the Public|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/just/12.html|website=Justice.gc.ca|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/discover-canada/read-online/rights-resonsibilities-citizenship.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary proof of Canadian citizenship==
Under current rules, the federal government has designated a number of documents as proof of citizenship:&lt;ref name="proof1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Documents accepted as proof of citizenship|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/proof-citizenship/documents.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="proof2"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to show proof of Canadian citizenship for adult passport applications|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-passports/new-adult-passport/citizenship-proof.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="types" /&gt;

* birth certificate issued by a provincial or territorial government;
* certificate of citizenship (including citizenship cards);
* certificate of naturalization (only issued to British subjects before 1 January 1947);
* certificate of retention (only issued between 1 January 1947 and 16 April 2009);
* certificate of registration of birth abroad (only issued between 1 January 1947 and 14 February 1977).

Among these documents, only the certificate of citizenship is still being issued by the federal government. The certificate is automatically issued to an individual who has become a Canadian citizen through naturalization, but can also be issued to any Canadian upon request. If requested, a certificate is only issued after a complete investigation on whether the individual possesses Canadian citizenship under the current or historical legislation.&lt;ref name="cic.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/guide-0001-application-citizenship-certificate-adults-minors-proof-citizenship-section-3.html| title=Application for a Citizenship Certificate for Adults and Minors (Proof of Citizenship) under Section 3 (CIT 0001)|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certificate replaced the wallet-sized citizenship card on 1 February 2012 and can be verified electronically, but unlike the citizenship card, it can no longer be used as an identification document as it does not contain a photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notice – New Citizenship Certificate|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/notices/new-citizenship-certificate.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The citizenship card was originally issued between 1954 and 1977 as a supplement of the larger certificate before the 1977 Act. Between 1977 and 2012, it was the only valid proof of Canadian citizenship for those who acquired citizenship through naturalization or by descent.&lt;ref name="types"&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of citizenship certificates|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/canadian-citizenship/proof/types-certificates.html|website=Canada.ca|publisher=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As those who were born in Canada normally acquired citizenship at birth under both 1947 and 1977 Acts, birth certificates issued by the provincial or territorial government are usually considered by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada as adequate proof of citizenship.&lt;ref name="proof1" /&gt; There are, however, complications when the person failed to acquire Canadian citizenship because of the exceptions listed under subsection 3(2) of the Act. As the federal government does not keep records of the immigration statuses of parents at birth, a person may be recognized as a Canadian-based solely on his or her birth within Canada when, in fact, he or she does not possess Canadian citizenship under subsection 3(2).&lt;ref name="proof1" /&gt; [[Deepan Budlakoti]], a stateless man born in Ontario, was twice issued a valid Canadian passport based on his Ontario birth certificate before the federal government realized that he is not a Canadian citizen under subsection 3(2) and revoked his Canadian passport.&lt;ref name="stateless"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brean|first1=Joseph|title=‘I can’t be stateless’: Born-in-Canada criminal fighting deportation after Ottawa decides citizenship not valid|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/i-cant-be-stateless-born-in-canada-criminal-fighting-deportation-after-ottawa-decides-citizenship-not-valid|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=National Post|publisher=Postmedia Network|date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents other than those listed above, including [[Canadian passport]]s, are not considered as proof of citizenship, but a passport is issued only after review of other documentary proof, as noted above. Church-issued baptismal certificates and birth certificates issued by an authority other than a provincial or territorial government are also not proof of Canadian citizenship. Such certificates were common in Quebec, as the provincial government did not start to issue birth certificates until 1994.&lt;ref name="types" /&gt;

A special birth certificate issued by the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] to children of CAF members born abroad before 1979, known as DND 419, is not a proof of citizenship due to the lack of legal status of the certificate.&lt;ref name="types" /&gt; This has caused difficulties for some individuals as they were forced to apply for a certificate of citizenship to confirm their status and to apply for a passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tighe|first1=Tony|title=Calgary woman’s Canadian birth certificate not recognized as proof of citizenship|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2279886/calgary-womans-canadian-birth-certificate-not-recognized-as-proof-of-citizenship/|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=Global News|date=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visa requirements==
{{main|Visa requirements for Canadian citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Canadian citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|right|[[Visa requirements for Canadian citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for [[Canadian citizen]]s are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Canada]]. According to the 2016 [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], holders of a [[Canadian passport]] can visit 172 countries and territories visa-free or with visa on arrival, and the score of Canada is currently ranked&lt;ref&gt;Using [[Ranking#Dense ranking ("1223" ranking)|dense ranking]].&lt;/ref&gt; 6th in terms of travel freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Visa Restriction Index 2016|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HP/hvri/HP%20Visa%20Restrictions%20Index%20160223.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commonwealth citizenship==
{{main|Commonwealth citizen}}
Although section 32 and 33 the 1977 Act recognizes citizens of other [[Commonwealth countries]] as Commonwealth citizens, no special privileges over other foreign nationals are accorded on them. Hence, a Commonwealth citizen without permanent resident status or Canadian citizenship is treated like any other foreign national in Canada.

Other Commonwealth countries recognize Canadian citizens as Commonwealth citizens, though the significance of this designation varies from one member state to another. For example, Canadians may be entitled to certain rights or privileges offered by the United Kingdom under British law, including:

* The ability to join the [[British Armed Forces]], subject to certain residency requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can I join? Eligibility for officers and soldiers|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/join/How-to-join.aspx|website=British Army}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AM I ELIGIBLE TO BE A RATING?|url=https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/careers/joining/get-ready-to-join/royal-navy-rating/am-i-eligible|website=Royal Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eligibility Check|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/recruitment/how-to-apply/eligibility-check/|website=Royal Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* If in need of consular assistance in a country that does not have a Canadian mission or a corresponding Australian mission under scopes of [[Canada–Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]], access to British consular service provided by the local branch of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Support for British nationals abroad: A summary|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/407661/FCO_BritsAbroad_DL_2014_web__1_.pdf|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Foster Story OTB 173 FleeingToTheCityOfRefuge.jpg|thumb|200px|Fleeing to the City of Refuge (Numbers 35:11-28). From Charles Foster, ''The Story of the Bible'', 1884.]]
The '''Cities of Refuge''' were six [[Levitical city|Levitical towns]] in the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] in which the perpetrators of accidental [[manslaughter]] could claim the [[right of asylum]]. [[Maimonides]], invoking talmudic literature, expands the city of refuge count to all 48 [[Levitical city|Levitical cities]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilchot Rotzeach, ch. 8 par. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
Outside of these cities, [[blood vengeance]] against such perpetrators was allowed by law.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Bruce M. |editor1-last=Metzger |editor1-link=Bruce M. Metzger |editor2-first=Michael D. |editor2-last=Coogan |editor2-link=Michael Coogan |title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-504645-5 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible names the six cities as being cities of refuge: [[Golan]], [[Ramoth-Gilead|Ramoth]], and [[Bosor]], on the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] of the [[Jordan River]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 4:43 and [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 20:8&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kedesh]], [[Shechem]], and [[Hebron]] on the western side.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua 20:7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical regulations==

===In the Priestly Code===
In the [[Priestly Code]], the regulations concerning the cities of refuge state that, once he had claimed asylum, a perpetrator had to be taken from the city and put on trial;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|35:11-24|}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the trial found that the perpetrator was innocent of murder, then the perpetrator had to be returned under guard (for their own protection) to the city in which they had claimed asylum.&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Numbers|35:25"&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|35:25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law code treats [[Blood money (term)|blood money]] as an unacceptable device that would compound the crime, insisting that [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] can only be made by blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|35:31-34|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Priestly Code states that no harm was allowed to come to the perpetrator once the [[Kohen Gadol|Jewish high priest]] had died, at which point the perpetrator was free to leave the city without fear;&lt;ref name="bibleverse||Numbers|35:25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|35:28|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mishnah]] states that the high priest's mother would traditionally supply clothing and food to those claiming asylum in the cities of refuge, so that these individuals would not wish for the death of her son.&lt;ref name="Makkot 11a"&gt;[[Makkot]] 11a&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]] argues that the death of the high priest formed an atonement,&lt;ref name="Makkot 11b"&gt;Makkot 11b&lt;/ref&gt; as the death of pious individuals counted as an atonement,&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoma]] 1:38b in the Jerusalem Talmud&lt;/ref&gt; and in its view, the high priest was extremely pious;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] argued that the death of the high priest was simply an event so upsetting to the Israelites that they dropped all thoughts of vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp176.htm#page_342 The Guide for the Perplexed] (III: 40):&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Deuteronomic Code===
The [[Deuteronomic Code]] prescribed that three cities be set aside to provide refuge on a regional basis,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:2-3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three additional cities to be set aside 'if the Lord your God enlarges your territory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:8-9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were not the three cities of refuge east of the Jordan, already established according to {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|4:41|HE}}, but a further three, potentially nine in total. [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] stated that the additional three cities allowed for "the anticipated enlargement of the borders of Israel to the utmost limits promised by God, from the [[river of Egypt]] to the [[Euphrates]]" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|15:8|HE}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/19.htm Barnes' Commentary] on Deuteronomy 19, accessed 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[King James Version]] refers in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:8|KJV}} to the enlargement of the ''coast'' of the [[promised land]].

The Deuteronomic regulations are presented in a different manner from in the Priestly Code and, rather than describing the perpetrator being put on trial, merely state that if the perpetrator is guilty of murder, the elders of the town in which the crime was committed should demand the perpetrator's return and hand him over without pity to the avenger of blood to be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:11-13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deuteronomic Code does not give any role to the high priest or mention the terms on which the perpetrator could return home, but does state that roads should be built to the cities of refuge to ease the escape of the perpetrator to them;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:3|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Talmud states that, in accordance with the requirement to especially build roads to the cities of refuge, the roads to these cities were not only marked by signposts saying "Refuge", but the roads were 32 [[ell]]s wide—twice the regulation width—and were particularly smooth and even, in order that fugitives were as unhindered as possible.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

A chapter in the [[Book of Joshua]] also reiterates the regulations for the cities of refuge, adding that when a perpetrator arrives at the city, he had to disclose the events that had occurred to the city elders, after which they had to find him a place to live within the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Joshua|20|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholars regard the chapter as being an insertion by the [[deuteronomist]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and, even in the Talmud, it is argued that the chapter had been moved and was originally part of the Torah as an aspect of the Deuteronomic Code;&lt;ref name="Makkot 11a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia, Asylum"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Asylum''&lt;/ref&gt; though the [[masoretic text]] for this chapter includes a role for the death of the high priest, the [[Septuagint]]'s version of the chapter does not mention it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Origin and development==
In many ancient cultures, the inviolability of deities was considered to extend to their religious sanctuaries and all that resided within, whether criminals, debtors, escaped slaves, priests, ordinary people, or, in some cases, passing cattle; biblical scholars suspect that Israelite culture was originally no different.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia, Asylum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"&gt;Cheyne and Black, ''[[Encyclopedia Biblica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia'', ''cities of refuge''&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the area covered by these rights of sanctuary varied from a small area around the altar or other centrepiece to a large area beyond the limits of the town containing the sanctuary (the limits often being marked in some way), depending on the significance of the deity and the importance of the sanctuary; it was considered a greater crime to drag an individual from the sanctuary or to kill them there than it was to defile the sanctuary itself.&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt;

Biblical scholars perceive this simple right of asylum at sanctuaries as being presented by the [[Covenant Code]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|21:12-14|}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[textual criticism|textual scholars]] attribute to the 8th century BC.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="who"&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scholars also believe that this right was the context underlying the account in the [[Books of Kings]] of [[Joab]] and [[Adonijah]] each fleeing from [[Solomon]] to an altar, with their opponents being unwilling to attack them while they remained there;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|1:50-53|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|2:28-30|}}&lt;/ref&gt; textual scholars regard these passages as being part of the [[Court History of David]],&lt;ref name="kings"&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Book of Kings''&lt;/ref&gt; which they date to the 9th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Elliott Friedman, ''The hidden book in the Bible''&lt;/ref&gt; or earlier.&lt;ref name="kings"/&gt;

Over time, these general rights of asylum were gradually curtailed, as some sanctuaries had become notorious hotbeds of crime; in [[Athens]], for example, the regulations were changed so that slaves were only permitted to escape to the sanctuary of the temple of [[Theseus]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia, Asylum"/&gt; This is considered by scholars to be the reason that, in Israelite culture, the rights were restricted to just six locations by the time the Priestly Code was compiled—the late 7th century according to textual scholars&lt;ref&gt;Richard Elliott Friedman, ''The Bible Unearthed''&lt;/ref&gt;—and it is thus regarded by biblical scholars as being no coincidence that the three cities of refuge to the west of the Jordan were also important ancient religious sanctuaries;&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt; little is known about the cities of refuge to the east of the Jordan (as of 1901), but scholars consider it reasonable to assume that they were once also important sanctuaries.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt;

The Deuteronomic Code is regarded by textual scholars as dating from the reign of [[Josiah]],&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; which postdates the fall of the Kingdom of Israel to the [[Assyria]]ns; this is considered to be the reason that only three (unnamed) cities of refuge are mentioned in the Deuteronomic Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:2|}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a further three only being added if the Israelite territory was expanded,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|19:8-9|}}&lt;/ref&gt; as by the time of Josiah's reign, the cities east of the Jordan were no longer controlled by the Israelites. The lack of importance given by the Deuteronomic Code to the identity of the cities of refuge is considered by scholars to be an attempt to continue the right of asylum, even though the sanctuaries (apart from the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]) had been abolished by Josiah's reforms.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia, Asylum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheyne_Black"/&gt;

==Asylum in classical Judea==
The classical rabbinical writers regarded all the cities controlled by the [[Levites]] as being cities of refuge, although they considered that asylum could only be claimed against the will of a city's inhabitants if the city was one of the six main cities of refuge.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Makkot 10a&lt;/ref&gt; Although there the six main ''cities of refuge'' were named in the Priestly Code, the Talmudic sources argued that other cities could, over time, be officially substituted for these six, to take account of changing political circumstances.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The substitute cities of refuge were constrained to be only of moderate size, since, if they were too small, there could be scarcity of food, forcing the refugee to imperil himself by leaving the city to find sustenance, and, if they were too large, then it would be too easy for an avenger of blood to hide in the crowds;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; nevertheless, the surrounding region was required to be quite populous since that way, an attack by the avenger of blood could be more easily repelled.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; The altar of the Temple in Jerusalem also came to be regarded as a place of sanctuary, but only counted for the officiating priest, and even then only temporarily, as the priest ultimately had to be taken to a city of refuge;&lt;ref&gt;Makkot 12a&lt;/ref&gt; when Jerusalem was under [[Seleucid]] control, [[Demetrius I Soter|Demetrius I]] offered to turn the Temple into an official place of sanctuary, though the offer was turned down.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

The rabbinical sources differentiated between four forms of killing, sometimes giving examples:&lt;ref&gt;Makkot 2:2, 8a&lt;/ref&gt;
*Complete innocence, for which no further action was necessary. This situation arises when someone is killed while the perpetrator is fulfilling his legal duties; for example, this situation arises if someone is accidentally killed by a teacher applying [[corporal punishment]].{{request quote|date=November 2016}}
*Negligence, which required exile to a city of refuge. This situation arises when someone is killed as a result of legal activity, which the perpetrator was not required to perform.
*Severe carelessness, for which exile is insufficient. This situation arises when someone is accidentally killed as a result of illegal activity by the perpetrator; for example, this situation arises if a shop owner fails to maintain their property, and it collapses and kills a legitimate customer.
*Murder, which was subject to the [[death penalty]].

According to classical rabbinical authorities, the cities of refuge were not places of protection, but places where atonement was made;&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; [[Philo]] explained this principle as being based on the theory that an innocent man would never be chosen by God as the instrument of another man's death, and therefore those claiming refuge at these cities must have committed some sin before they had killed, for which their exile acts as an atonement.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Specialibus Legibus'' III:120&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, these rabbinical authorities argued that if the perpetrator had died before reaching a city of refuge, their body still had to be taken there, and, if they had died before the high priest had, then their body had to be buried at the city of refuge until the high priest expired;&lt;ref name="Makkot 11b"/&gt; even if the perpetrator lived beyond the death of the high priest, the rabbinical authorities forbade them from holding political office.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt; Furthermore, since it was to be a place of atonement, the rabbinical authorities required that the perpetrator should always contemplate the fact that they had killed someone and should refuse any honour that the denizens of the city might grant them from time to time, unless the denizens persisted.&lt;ref&gt;Makkot 2:8&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clean Air Act''' ([[Title 42 of the United States Code|42 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7401 § 7401]) is a [[United States federal law]] designed to control [[air pollution]] on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/plain-english-guide-clean-air-act |title=The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act |date=April 2007 |website=Clean Air Act Overview |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the United States' first and most influential modern [[environmental law]]s, and one of the most comprehensive [[air quality law]]s in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Environmental Laws and Treaties|url= http://www.nrdc.org/reference/laws.asp |website = |publisher=Natural Resources Defense Council |accessdate=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://photos.state.gov/libraries/mumbai/498320/fernandesma/June_2012_001.pdf|title = History of the Modern Environmental Movement in America|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Gordon|first = Erin L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other major [[United States environmental law|U.S. federal environmental statutes]], it is administered by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), in coordination with state, local, and tribal governments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Summary of the Clean Air Act|url = http://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act|website = |accessdate = 2015-12-22 |publisher=EPA|date = 2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its implementing regulations are codified at [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 C.F.R.]] Sub-chapter C, Parts 50-97.

The 1955 [[Air Pollution Control Act]] was the first U.S. federal legislation that pertained to [[air pollution]]; it also provided funds for federal government research of air pollution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first federal legislation to actually pertain to "controlling" air pollution was the Clean Air Act of 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Beijing smog: What makes some cities cleaner than others?|url = http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/1208/Beijing-smog-What-makes-some-cities-cleaner-than-others|newspaper = Christian Science Monitor|access-date = 2015-12-22|issn = 0882-7729|first = Lonnie|last = Shekhtman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1963 act accomplished this by establishing a federal program within the U.S. Public Health Service and authorizing research into techniques for monitoring and controlling air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Energy Efficiency: Benefits for Environment and Society|last = Yang,|first = Ming|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was first amended in 1965, by the [[Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act]], which authorized the federal government to set required [[Automobile emissions control|standards for controlling the emission of pollutants]] from certain automobiles, beginning with the 1968 models. A second amendment, the Air Quality Act of 1967, enabled the federal government to increase its activities to investigate enforcing interstate air pollution transport, and, for the first time, to perform far-reaching ambient monitoring studies and stationary source inspections. The 1967 act also authorized expanded studies of air pollutant emission inventories, ambient monitoring techniques, and control techniques.&lt;ref name="CAA-history"&gt;{{USGovernment|sourceURL=[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/amendments.html History of the Clean Air Act], ''U.S. Environmental Protection Agency''}}{{cite web| title =History of the Clean Air Act| publisher =[[Environmental Protection Agency]]| date =August 8, 2013| url =http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/amendments.html| accessdate =August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While only six states had air pollution programs in 1960, all 50 states had air pollution programs by 1970 due to the federal funding and legislation of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Amendments approved in 1970 greatly expanded the federal mandate, requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both [[major stationary source|stationary (industrial) pollution sources]] and [[Mobile source air pollution|mobile sources]]. It also significantly expanded federal [[Environmental law#Enforcement|enforcement]]. Also, EPA was established on December 2, 1970 for the purpose of consolidating pertinent federal research, monitoring, standard-setting and enforcement activities into one agency that ensures environmental protection.&lt;ref name="EPA-history"&gt;{{USGovernment|sourceURL=[http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/amendments.html EPA History], ''U.S. Environmental Protection Agency''}}{{cite web| title =EPA History| publisher =Environmental Protection Agency| date =March 12, 2014| url =http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/epa-history| accessdate =August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rinde|first1=Meir|title=Richard Nixon and the Rise of American Environmentalism |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1|pages=16–29|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/richard-nixon-and-the-rise-of-american-environmentalism|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further amendments were made in 1990 to address the problems of [[acid rain]], [[ozone depletion]], and toxic air pollution, and to establish a national permit program for stationary sources, and increased enforcement authority. The amendments also established new auto gasoline reformulation requirements, set [[Reid vapor pressure]] (RVP) standards to [[Evaporative emission#Evaporative emissions control|control Evaporative emissions]] from gasoline, and mandated new gasoline formulations sold from May to September in many states. Reviewing his tenure as EPA Administrator under President [[George H. W. Bush]], [[William K. Reilly]] characterized passage of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act as his most notable accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William K. Reilly describes why passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments was vitally important. Reflections on US Environmental Policy: An Interview with William K. Reilly [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=37 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/3E0FC143699CD31B.pdf#page=3 Transcript] (see p10).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clean Air Act was the first major [[environmental law]] in the United States to include a provision for [[citizen suit]]s. Numerous state and local governments have enacted similar legislation, either implementing federal programs or filling in locally important gaps in federal programs.

====Part A: Air Quality and Emissions Limitations====
This section of the act declares that protecting and enhancing the nation's air quality promotes [[Environmental health|public health]]. The law encourages to prevent regional air pollution and control programs. It also provides technical and financial assistance for preventing air pollution at both state and local governments. Additional sub chapters cover cooperation, research, investigation, training, and other activities. Grants for air pollution planning and control programs, and interstate air quality agencies and program cost limitations are also included in this section.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Air Act: Title I - Air Pollution Prevention and Control|url=http://epa.gov/oar/caa/title1.html|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|accessdate=29 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501115617/http://epa.gov/oar/caa/title1.html|archivedate=1 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act even mandates air quality control regions, designated as attainment vs non-attainment. Non-attainment areas do not meet national standards for primary or secondary ambient air quality. Attainment areas meet these standards, while unclassified areas cannot be classified based on the available information.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act"/&gt;

Air quality criteria, national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, state implementation plans and performance standards for new stationary sources are covered in Part A as well. The list of hazardous air pollutants that the act establishes includes compounds of [[Acetaldehyde]], [[benzene]], [[chloroform]], [[Phenol]], and [[selenium]]. The list also includes mineral fiber emissions from manufacturing or processing glass, rock or slag fibers as well as radioactive atoms. The list can periodically be modified. The act lists unregulated radioactive pollutants such as [[cadmium]], [[arsenic]], and poly cyclic organic matter and it mandates listing them if they will cause or contribute to air pollution that endangers public health, under section 7408 or 7412.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act"/&gt;

The remaining sub-chapters cover smokestack heights, state plan adequacy, and estimating emissions of [[carbon monoxide]], [[volatile organic compounds]], and oxides of [[nitrogen]] from area and mobile sources. Measures to prevent unemployment or other economic disruption include using local [[coal]] or coal derivatives to comply with implementation requirements. The final sub chapter in this act focuses on land use authority.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act"/&gt;

====Part B: Ozone Protection====
Because of advances in the atmospheric chemistry, this section was replaced by [[Clean Air Act (United States)#Title VI - Stratospheric Ozone Protection|Title VI]] when the law was amended in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://epa.gov/oar/caa/title6.html "Clean Air Act: Title VI - Stratospheric Ozone Protection."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126231737/http://www.epa.gov/oar/caa/title6.html |date=2010-11-26 }} Updated 2008-12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

This change in the law reflected significant changes in scientific understanding of [[ozone]] formation and depletion. Ozone absorbs [[Ultraviolet|UVC light]] and shorter wave [[UVB]], and lets through UVA, which is largely harmless to people. Ozone exists naturally in the [[stratosphere]], not the troposphere. It is laterally distributed because it is destroyed by strong sunlight, so there is more ozone at the poles. Ozone is created when O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes in contact with photons from solar radiation. Therefore, a decrease in the intensity of solar radiation also results in a decrease in the formation of ozone in the stratosphere. This exchange is known as the Chapman mechanism:

:O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV photon → 2 O (note that atmospheric [[oxygen]] as O is highly unstable)

:O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + M → O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is Ozone) + M

:''M represents a third molecule, needed to carry off the excess energy of the collision of O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.''

Atmospheric [[freon]] and [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs) contribute to ozone depletion (Chlorine is a catalytic agent in ozone destruction). Following discovery of the ozone hole in 1985, the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]] successfully implemented a plan to replace CFCs and was viewed by some environmentalists as an example of what is possible for the future of environmental issues, if the political will is present.

====Part C - Prevention of Significant Deterioration of Air Quality====
The Clean Air Act requires permits to build or add to major stationary sources of air pollution. This permitting process, known as New Source Review (NSR), applies to sources in areas that meet [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards|air quality standards]] as well as areas that are unclassified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/pdfs/CAA_Nutshell.pdf |title=The Clean Air Act in a Nutshell: How It Works |format=pdf |accessdate=2014-04-24 |quote=Collectively, the PSD permitting program and nonattainment area permitting program for major sources are known as "New Source Review." Before starting the construction of a new major source located in an attainment, or unclassifiable area, or the modification of an existing major source that results in a significant emissions increase in such areas, the source must obtain a PSD permit under the Act.|date=2015-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permits in attainment or unclassified areas are referred to as Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permits, while permits for sources located in nonattainment areas are referred to as non attainment area (NAA) permits.&lt;ref name="NSR Workshop Manual"&gt;EPA (1990). ''[http://www.epa.gov/ttn/nsr/gen/wkshpman.pdf New Source Review Workshop Manual: Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Nonattainment Area Permitting.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental goals of the PSD program are to:
# prevent new non-attainment areas by ensuring economic growth in harmony with existing clean air;
# protect public health and welfare from any adverse effects;
# preserve and enhance the air quality in national parks and other areas of special natural recreational, scenic, or historic value.&lt;ref name="NSR Workshop Manual" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

====Part D: Plan Requirements for Non-attainment Areas====
Under the Clean Air Act states are required to submit a plan for non-attainment areas to reach attainment status as soon as possible but in no more than five years, based on the severity of the air pollution and the difficulty posed by obtaining cleaner air.

The plan must include:
* an inventory of all pollutants
* permits
* control measures, means and techniques to reach standard qualifications
* contingency measures

The plan must be approved or revised if required for approval, and specify whether local governments or the state will implement and enforce the various changes. Achieving attainment status makes a request for reevaluation possible. It must include a plan for maintenance of air quality.

===Title II: Emission Standards for Moving Sources===
[[File:Comparison of Growth Areas and Emissions 1980-2015 US EPA.png|thumb|Graph showing decreases in US air pollution emissions from transportation sources during 1980-2015, while US population and economic activity increased.]]
====Part A: Motor Vehicle Emission and Fuel Standards====
Sub-chapters of Title II cover state standards and grants, prohibited acts and actions to restrain violations, as well as a study of [[Exhaust gas|emissions]] from non road vehicles (other than locomotives) to determine whether they cause or contribute to air pollution. [[Motorcycles]] are treated in the same way as automobiles under the emission standards for new motor vehicles or motor vehicle engines. The last few sub chapters deal with high altitude performance adjustments, motor vehicle compliance program fees, prohibition on production of engines requiring [[leaded gasoline]] and urban bus standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Air Act: Title II - Emission Standards for Moving Sources|url=http://epa.gov/oar/caa/title2.html#iia|publisher=EPA|accessdate=30 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501115642/http://epa.gov/oar/caa/title2.html#iia|archive-date=2012-05-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This part of the bill was extremely controversial the time it was passed. The automobile industry argued that it could not meet the new standards&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/air.pdf “Cleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.]” EPA Alumni Association. September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;. Senators expressed concern about impact on the economy. However the stricter standards led to the creation of the catalytic converter, which was a revolutionary development. (Coincidentally, these converters didn't work well with leaded gas, which contributed to the swift removal of lead from gasoline that was also recognized for having adverse health effects.)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specific new emissions standards for moving sources passed years later. 

====Part B: Aircraft Emission Standards====
Many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted over airports and affect the air quality in the region. VOCs include [[benzene]], [[formaldehyde]] and [[butadienes]] which are known to cause health problems such as birth defects, [[cancer]] and skin irritation. Hundreds of tons of emissions from aircraft, ground support equipment, heating systems, and shuttles and passenger vehicles are released into the air, causing [[smog]]. Therefore, major cities such as [[Seattle]], [[Denver]], and [[San Francisco]] require a [[Climate Action Plan]] as well as a [[greenhouse]] gas inventory. Additionally, federal programs such as the [https://www.faa.gov/airports/environmental/vale/ Voluntary Airport Low Emissions Program (VALE)] are working to offset costs for programs that reduce emissions.&lt;ref name="Sustainability Trends"&gt;{{cite web|last=Trendowski|first=John|title=Sustainability Trends — Reducing Emissions at Airports|url=http://www.cscos.com/pdf/articles/AirportMagazineSustainabilityArticle.pdf|publisher=Airport Magazine|accessdate=22 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209221726/http://cscos.com/pdf/articles/AirportMagazineSustainabilityArticle.pdf|archivedate=9 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title II sets emission standards for airlines and aircraft engines and adopts standards set by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). However aircraft [[carbon dioxide]] emission standards have not been established by either ICAO nor the EPA.&lt;ref name="Aircraft Emissions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft Emissions Expected to Grow, but Technological and Operational Improvements and Government Policies Can Help Control Emissions |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09554.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office|accessdate=22 April 2012}} Report no. GAO-09-554.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the responsibility of the [[Secretary of Transportation]], after consultation with the Administrator, to prescribe regulations that comply with [https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2013-title42/html/USCODE-2013-title42-chap85-subchapII-partB-sec7571.htm 42 U.S. Code § 7571] (Establishment of standards) and ensure the necessary inspections take place.&lt;ref name="Title II"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Air Act|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7574|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Part C: Clean Fuel Vehicles====
Trucks and automobiles play a large role in deleterious air quality. Harmful chemicals such as [[nitrogen oxide]], [[hydrocarbons]], [[carbon monoxide]] and [[sulfur dioxide]] are released from motor vehicles. Some of these also react with sunlight to produce [[photochemical smog|Photochemical]].&lt;ref name="Biodiesel"&gt;{{cite web|title=www.biodiesel.org|url=http://biodiesel.org/reports/19980301_gen-044.pdf|website=The Clean Air Act's Clean-Fuel Vehicle Program|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These harmful substances change the climate, alter ocean pH and include toxins that may cause cancer, birth defects or respiratory illness.

&lt;!-- [[File:donotidle.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=A|A traffic sign that encourages people to reduce car pollutants.]] --&gt;
Motor vehicles increased in the 1990s since approximately 58 percent of households owned two or more vehicles.&lt;ref name=Biodiesel/&gt; The Clean Fuel Vehicle programs focused on alternative fuel use and petroleum fuels that met low emission vehicle (LEV) levels. Compressed [[natural gas]], [[ethanol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shackleton |first=Abe |url=http://www.openfuelstandard.org/2011/06/what-is-ethanol.html |title=What is Ethanol? |publisher=Open Fuel Standard |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[methanol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shackleton |first=Abe |url=http://www.openfuelstandard.org/2011/05/what-is-methanol.html |title=What is Methanol? |publisher=Open Fuel Standard |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; liquefied [[petroleum]] gas and electricity are examples of cleaner alternative fuel. Programs such as the California Clean Fuels Program and pilot program are increasing demand that for new fuels to be developed to reduce harmful emissions.&lt;ref name="Biodiesel"/&gt;

The California pilot program incorporated under this section focuses on pollution control in [[ozone]] non-attainment areas. The provisions apply to light-duty trucks and light-duty vehicles in [[California]]. The state also requires that clean alternative fuels for sale at numerous locations with sufficient geographic distribution for convenience. Production of clean-fuel vehicles isn't mandated except as part of the California pilot program.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act"/&gt;

===Title III: General Provisions===
Under the law prior to 1990, EPA was required to construct a list of Hazardous Air Pollutants as well as health-based standards for each one. There were 187 air pollutants listed and the source from which they came. The EPA was given ten years to generate technology-based emission standards. Title III is considered a second phase, allowing the EPA to assess lingering risks after the enactment of the first phase of emission standards. Title III also enacts new standards with regard to the protection of public health.&lt;ref&gt;"Title III: General" Clean Air Act, United States. The Earth Encyclopedia. Updated: Apr 12, 2011. http://www.eoearth.org/article/Clean_Air_Act,_United_States&lt;/ref&gt;

A citizen may file a lawsuit to obtain compliance with an emission standard issued by the EPA or by a state, unless there is an ongoing enforcement action being pursued by EPA or the appropriate state agency.&lt;ref&gt;CAA section 304, {{usc|42|7604}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title IV: Noise Pollution===
This title pre-dates the ''Clean Air Act''. With the passage of the ''Clean Air Act'', it became codified as Title IV. However, another Title IV was enacted in the 1990 amendments. The second Title IV was then appended to this Title IV as Title IV-A (see below).

This title established the EPA Office of Noise Abatement and Control to reduce [[noise pollution]] in urban areas, to minimize noise-related impacts on psychological and physiological effects on humans, effects on wildlife and property (including values), and other noise-related issues. The agency was also assigned to run experiments to study the effects of noise.
{{See also|Noise Control Act}}

===Title IV-A: Acid Deposition Control===
This title was added as part of the 1990 amendments. It addresses the issue of acid rain, which is caused by [[nitrogen oxides]] ({{NOx}}) and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions from electric power plants powered by fossil fuels, and other industrial sources. The 1990 amendments gave industries more pollution control options including switching to low-sulfur coal and/or adding devices that controlled the harmful emissions. In some cases plants had to be closed down to prevent the dangerous chemicals from entering the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Acid Deposition"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IV: Acid Deposition Control. Clean Air Act, United States. The Earth Encyclopedia. Updated: April 12, 2011 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Clean_Air_Act,_United_States#gen4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title IV-A mandated a two-step process to reduce SO{{sub|2}} emissions. The first stage required more than 100 electric generating facilities larger than 100 megawatts to meet a 3.5 million ton SO{{sub|2}} emission reduction by January 1995. The second stage gave facilities larger than 75 megawatts a January 2000 deadline.&lt;ref name="Acid Deposition"/&gt;

===Title V: Permits===
The 1990 amendments authorized a national operating permit program, covering thousands of large industrial and commercial sources.&lt;ref name="Permits and Enforcement."&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/permits.html "Permits and Enforcement."] ''The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act.'' Revised 2011-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; It required large businesses to address pollutants released into the air, measure their quantity, and have a plan to control and minimize them as well as to periodically report. This consolidated requirements for a facility into a single document.&lt;ref name="Permits and Enforcement."/&gt;

In non-attainment areas, permits were required for sources that emit as little as 50, 25, or 10 tons per year of VOCs depending on the severity of the region’s non-attainment status.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act Summary"&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=James|title=Clean Air Act: A Summary of the Act and its Major Requirements|url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/47810.pdf|publisher=CRS Report for Congress|accessdate=23 April 2012|date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most permits are issued by state and local agencies.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (February 1998). [http://www.epa.gov/air/oaqps/permits/permitupdate/permits.pdf "Air Pollution Operating Permit Program Update: Key Features and Benefits."] Document no. EPA/451/K-98/002. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; If the state does not adequately monitor requirements, the EPA may take control. The public may request to view the permits by contacting the EPA. The permit is limited to no more than five years and requires a renewal.&lt;ref name="Clean Air Act Summary"/&gt;

===Title VI: Stratospheric Ozone Protection===
Starting in 1990, Title VI mandated regulations regarding the use and production of chemicals that harm the Earth’s stratospheric [[ozone layer]]. This ozone layer protects against harmful [[ultraviolet]] B sunlight linked to several medical conditions including cataracts and skin cancer.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/airquality/peg_caa/stratozone.html "Protecting the Stratospheric Ozone Layer."] ''The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act.'' Revised 2011-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ozone-destroying chemicals were classified into two groups, Class I and Class II. Class I consists of substances, including chlorofluorocarbons, that have an [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP) (HL) of 0.2 or higher. Class II lists substances, including hydro chlorofluorocarbons, that are known to or may be detrimental to the stratosphere. Both groups have a timeline for phase-out:
* For Class I substances, no more than seven years after being added to the list and
* For Class II substances no more than ten years.&lt;ref name="Stratosphere"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title VI: Stratospheric Ozone Protection. Clean Air Act, United States. The Earth Encyclopedia. Updated: April 12, 2011 |url= http://www.eoearth.org/article/Clean_Air_Act,_United_States#gen2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Title VI establishes methods for preventing harmful chemicals from entering the stratosphere in the first place, including recycling or proper disposal of chemicals and finding substitutes that cause less or no damage.&lt;ref name= Stratosphere /&gt; The Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program is EPA's program to evaluate and regulate substitutes for the ozone-depleting chemicals that are being phased out under the stratospheric ozone protection provisions of the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) Program|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=5 August 2013|date=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 190 countries signed the [[Montreal Protocol]] in 1987, agreeing to work to eliminate or limit the use of chemicals with ozone-destroying properties.&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;

[[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the first legislation to address air pollution with the 1955 Air Pollution Control Act that provided funds to the U.S. Public Health service, but did not formulate pollution regulation.&lt;ref name=encyc-jacob/&gt; However, the Clean Air Act in 1963 created a research and regulatory program in the U.S. [[Public Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act of 1963, [http://www.epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf P.L. 88-206], {{usstat|77|392}}, 1963-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act authorized development of [[emission standard]]s for [[major stationary source|stationary sources]], but not [[mobile source air pollution|mobile sources of air pollution]].&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Atmospheric Pollution: History, Science, and Regulation |last=Jacobson |first=Mark Z. |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-521-01044-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|211}}&lt;!-- Add info on Motor Vehicle Air Pollution Control Act of 1965 --&gt; The 1967 '''Air Quality Act''' mandated enforcement of interstate air pollution standards and authorized ambient monitoring studies and stationary source inspections.&lt;ref name="EPA History"&gt;EPA.

In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, {{usstat|84|1676}},
[http://www.epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf P.L. 91-604], 1970-12-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The law established four new regulatory programs:
* [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS). EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[Photochemical smog|photochemical oxidants]]. (Some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation.)&lt;ref name="Jacobson" /&gt;{{rp|213}}&lt;ref&gt;EPA.

* [[State Implementation Plan]]s (SIPs)
* [[New Source Performance Standard]]s (NSPS); and
* [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants]] (NESHAPs).
The 1970 law is sometimes called the "Muskie Act" because of the central role Maine Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] played in drafting the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muskie Act |publisher=[[Toyota Motor Corp]].
|url=http://www.toyota.co.jp/en/environment/communication/glossary/glossary_02.html#g05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To implement the strict new Clean Air Act of 1970, during his first term as EPA Administrator [[William Ruckelshaus]] spent 60% of his time on the automobile industry, whose emissions were to be reduced 90% under the new law. Senators had been frustrated at the industry’s failure to cut emissions under previous, weaker air laws.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: William Ruckelshaus in a 2013 interview discusses his first-term efforts at implementing the Clean Air Act of 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=14 Transcript] (see p14).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 required Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) of air quality for areas attaining the NAAQS and added requirements for non-attainment areas.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, [http://www.epw.senate.gov/envlaws/cleanair.pdf P.L. 95-95], {{usstat|91|685}}, 1977-08-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990 Clean Air Act added regulatory programs for control of acid deposition (acid rain) and stationary source operating permits. The amendments moved considerably beyond the original criteria pollutants, expanding the NESHAP program with a list of 189 hazardous air pollutants to be controlled within hundreds of source categories, according to a specific schedule.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/peg/toxics.html "Reducing Toxic Air Pollutants."] ''The Plain English Guide to the Clean Air Act.'' Revised 2011-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The NAAQS program was also expanded.

=== History of the Clean Air Act ===

==== Introduction ====
[[File:Clean Air Act Signing.jpg|thumb|President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signing the 1967 Air Quality Act in the East Room of [[the White House]], November 21, 1967.]]
The legal authority for federal programs regarding air pollution control is based on the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (1990 CAAA). These are the latest in a series of amendments made to the Clean Air Act (CAA), often referred to as "the Act." This legislation modified and extended federal legal authority provided by the earlier Clean Air Acts of 1963 and 1970.&lt;ref name=CAA-history/&gt;

The 1955 [[Air Pollution Control Act]] was the first federal legislation involving air pollution; it authorized $3 million per year to the U.S. Public Health Service for five years to fund federal level air pollution research, air pollution control research, and technical and training assistance to the states. Subsequently, the act was extended for four years in 1959 with funding levels at $5 million per year. The act was then amended in 1960 and 1962. Although the 1955 act brought the air pollution issue to the federal level, no federal regulations were formulated. Control and prevention of air pollution was instead delegated to state and local agencies.&lt;ref name="encyc-jacob"&gt;

The Clean Air Act of 1963 was the first federal legislation regarding air pollution control. It established a federal program within the U.S. Public Health Service and authorized research into techniques for monitoring and controlling air pollution. In 1967, the [[Air quality law|Air Quality Act]] was enacted in order to expand federal government activities. In accordance with this law, enforcement proceedings were initiated in areas subject to interstate air pollution transport. As part of these proceedings, the federal government for the first time conducted extensive ambient monitoring studies and stationary source inspections.

The Air Quality Act of 1967 also authorized expanded studies of air pollutant emission inventories, ambient monitoring techniques, and control techniques.&lt;ref name=CAA-history/&gt;

==== Clean Air Act of 1970 ====
The ''Clean Air Act of 1970'' (1970 CAA) authorized the development of comprehensive federal and state regulations to limit emissions from both stationary (industrial) sources and mobile sources. Four major regulatory programs affecting stationary sources were initiated:
* the National Ambient Air Quality Standards [NAAQS (pronounced "knacks")],
* State Implementation Plans (SIPs),
* New Source Performance Standards (NSPS),
* and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs).

Enforcement authority was substantially expanded. This very important legislation was adopted at approximately the same time as the ''[[National Environmental Policy Act]]''.&lt;ref name=CAA-history/&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

==== Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 ====
Major amendments were added to the ''Clean Air Act'' in 1977 (1977 CAAA). The 1977 Amendments primarily concerned provisions for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) of air quality in areas attaining the NAAQS. The 1977 CAAA also contained requirements pertaining to sources in non-attainment areas for NAAQS. A non-attainment area is a geographic area that does not meet one or more of the federal air quality standards. Both of these 1977 CAAA established major permit review requirements to ensure attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS.&lt;ref name=CAA-history/&gt; These amendments also included the adoption of an offset trading policy originally applied to Los Angeles in 1974 that enables new sources to offset their emissions by purchasing extra reductions from existing sources.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 ====
Another set of major amendments to the Clean Air Act occurred in 1990 (1990 CAAA). The 1990 CAAA substantially increased the authority and responsibility of the federal government. New regulatory programs were authorized for control of acid deposition (acid rain)&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see p6). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and for the issuance of stationary source operating permits. The NESHAPs were incorporated into a greatly expanded program for controlling toxic air pollutants. The provisions for attainment and maintenance of NAAQS were substantially modified and expanded. Other revisions included provisions regarding stratospheric ozone protection, increased enforcement authority, and expanded research programs.&lt;ref name=CAA-history/&gt;

===Regulations===
{{Expand section|additional regulations|date=June 2011}}
Since the initial establishment of six mandated criteria pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and [[lead]]), advancements in testing and monitoring have led to the discovery of many other significant air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://epa.gov/airquality/urbanair/ "What Are the Six Common Air Pollutants?"] Revised 2010-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the act in place and its many improvements, the U.S. has seen many pollutant levels and associated cases of health complications drop. According to the EPA, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has prevented or will prevent:

&lt;!-- Add 1998 TEA-21 amendments on ozone, etc. (see Title VI of TEA-21 law) --&gt;

In 1997 EPA tightened the NAAQS regarding permissible levels of the [[Tropospheric ozone|ground-level ozone]] that make up [[smog]] and the fine airborne [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] that makes up [[soot]].&lt;ref name="nyt062697"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/26/us/clinton-sharply-tightens-air-pollution-regulations-despite-concern-over-costs.html | title=Clinton Sharply Tightens Air Pollution Regulations Despite Concern Over Costs |author1=Cushman Jr. |author2=John H. | newspaper=New York Times | date=June 26, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn110700"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/11/07/scotus.cleanair.02/index.html |title=U.S. Supreme Court hears clean air cases regarding smog and soot standards |author=Chebium, Raju |publisher=CNN |date=November 7, 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012935/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/11/07/scotus.cleanair.02/index.html |archivedate=2007-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision came after months of public review of the proposed new standards, as well as long and fierce internal discussion within the [[Clinton administration]], leading to the most divisive environmental debate of that decade.&lt;ref name="nyt062597"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/25/us/d-amato-vows-to-fight-for-epa-s-tightened-air-standards.html | title=D'Amato Vows to Fight for E.P.A.'s Tightened Air Standards |author1=Cushman Jr. |author2=John H. | newspaper=New York Times | date=June 25, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new regulations were challenged in the courts by industry groups as a violation of the [[Nondelegation doctrine|U.S. Constitution's nondelegation principle]] and eventually landed in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]],&lt;ref name="cnn110700"/&gt; whose 2001 unanimous ruling in ''[[Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns, Inc.]]'' largely upheld EPA's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/28/us/epa-s-right-to-set-air-rules-wins-supreme-court-backing.html | title=E.P.A.'s Right to Set Air Rules Wins Supreme Court Backing | author=Greenhouse, Linda | newspaper=New York Times | date=2001-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) directs [[EPA]] to establish national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for pollutants at levels that will protect public health. [[EPA]] and [[American Lung Association]] promoted the [[2011 Cross State Air Pollution Rule]] (CSAPR) to control ozone and fine particles. Aim was to cut emissions half from 2005 to 2014. It was claimed to prevent each year 400,000 asthma cases and save ca 2m work and schooldays lost by respiratory illness. Some states (e.g. Texas), cities and power companies sued the case ([[EPA v EME Homer City Generation]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1182_bqm1.pdf Supreme Court Of The United States &lt;span class="CMY_Response"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="CMY_Response"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609023600/http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/12-1182_bqm1.pdf |date=2014-06-09 }} Decided April 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals-court judges decided by two to one that the rule is too strict. Based on appeals the power companies were allowed to continue thousands of persons respiratory illnesses prolonged time in the USA. According to [[the Economist]] (2013) the Supreme Court decision may affect how the EPA regulates other pollutants, including the [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref&gt;Interstate pollution Smother my neighbour The Economist September 7th 2013 page 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of the federal government and states==
The 1970 Clean Air Act required states to develop State Implementation Plans for how they would meet new national ambient air quality standards by 1977&lt;ref&gt;“Early Implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970 in California.” EPA Alumni Association. [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=38 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/2B9E3C6816EC9466.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see p6). July 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the 1990 Clean Air Act is a federal law covering the entire country, the [[U.S. state|states]] do much of the work to carry out the Act. The EPA has allowed the individual states to elect responsibility for compliance with and regulation of the CAA within their own borders in exchange for funding. For example, a state air pollution agency holds a hearing on a permit application by a [[power plant|power]] or [[chemical plant]] or fines a company for violating air pollution limits. However, election is not mandatory and in some cases states have chosen to not accept responsibility for enforcement of the act and force the EPA to assume those duties.

In order to take over compliance with the CAA the states must write and submit a state implementation plan ([[State Implementation Plan|SIP]]) to the EPA for approval. A state implementation plan is a collection of the [[regulations]] a state will use to clean up polluted areas. The states are obligated to notify the public of these plans, through hearings that offer opportunities to comment, in the development of each state implementation plan. The SIP becomes the state's legal guide for local enforcement of the CAA. For example, [[Rhode Island]] law requires compliance with the Federal CAA through the SIP.&lt;ref&gt;Rhode Island General Law, Title 23, Chapter 23, Section 2 (RIGL 23-23-2).&lt;/ref&gt; The SIP delegates permitting and enforcement responsibility to the state Department of Environmental Management (RI-DEM).

The federal law recognizes that states should lead in carrying out the Clean Air Act, because [[pollution control]] problems often require special understanding of local industries, geography, housing patterns, etc. However, states are not allowed to have weaker [[pollution]] controls than the national minimum criteria set by EPA. EPA must approve each SIP, and if a SIP isn't acceptable, EPA can take over CAA enforcement in that state. For example, California was unable to meet the new standards set by the Clean Air Act of 1970, which led to a lawsuit and a federal state implementation plan for the state&lt;ref&gt;“Early Implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970 in California.” EPA Alumni Association. [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=38 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/2B9E3C6816EC9466.pdf#page=1 Transcript]. July 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The United States government, through the EPA, assists the states by providing scientific [[research]], expert studies, [[engineering]] designs, and money to support clean air programs.

[[Metropolitan planning organization]]s must approve all federally funded transportation projects in a given urban area. If the MPO's plans do not, [[Federal Highway Administration]] and the [[Federal Transit Administration]] have the authority to withhold funds if the plans do not conform with federal requirements, including air quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Department of Transportation (2010). [http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/txdotmanuals/mpo/planning_process_selfcertification.htm "Metropolitan Planning Funds Administration. Section 5: Planning Process Self-Certification."] ''TxDOT Manual System.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the EPA directly fined the [[San Joaquin Valley]] Air Pollution Control District $29 million for failure to meet ozone standards, resulting in fees for county drivers and businesses. This was the results of a federal appeals court case that required the EPA to continue enforce older, stronger standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/gwire/2011/07/01/01greenwire-dc-circuit-rejects-epas-latest-guidance-on-smo-51144.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | first=Gabriel | last=Nelson | title=D.C.

===State Programs===
Many states, or concerned citizens of the state, have established their own programs to help promote pollution clean-up strategies.

For example,(in alphabetical order by state)
* California - California's Clean Air Project - designed to create a smoke-free gaming atmosphere in tribal casinos
* Georgia - [[The Clean Air Campaign]]
* Illinois - Illinois Citizens for Clean Air and Water - coalition of farmers and other citizens to reduce harmful effects of large-scale livestock production methods

* Virginia - Virginia Clean Cities, Inc.

==Interstate air pollution==
Air pollution often travels from its source in one state to another state. In many [[metropolitan areas]], people live in one state and work or shop in another; air pollution from cars and trucks may spread throughout the [[wikt:interstate|interstate]] area. The 1990 Clean Air Act provides for interstate commissions on air pollution control, which are to develop regional strategies for cleaning up air pollution. The 1990 amendments include other provisions to reduce interstate air pollution.

The [[Acid Rain Program]], created under Title IV of the Act, authorizes [[emissions trading]] to reduce the overall cost of controlling emissions of [[sulfur dioxide]].

==Leak detection and repair==
The Act requires industrial facilities to implement a Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) program to monitor and audit a facility's fugitive emissions of [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOC). The program is intended to identify and repair components such as valves, pumps, compressors, [[flange]]s, connectors and other components that may be leaking. These components are the main source of the fugitive VOC emissions.

Testing is done manually using a portable vapor analyzer that read in parts per million (ppm). Monitoring frequency, and the leak threshold, is determined by various factors such as the type of component being tested and the chemical running through the line. Moving components such as pumps and agitators are monitored more frequently than non-moving components such as flanges and screwed connectors. The regulations require that when a leak is detected the component be repaired within a set amount of days. Most facilities get 5 days for an initial repair attempt with no more than 15 days for a complete repair. Allowances for delaying the repairs beyond the allowed time are made for some components where repairing the component requires shutting process equipment down.

==Application to greenhouse gas emissions==
{{main article|Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act}}
EPA began regulating [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time on January 2, 2011, after having established its first auto emissions standards in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-12/documents/20101223factsheet.pdf|title=Fact Sheet: Clean Air Act Permitting for Greenhouse Gas Emissions – Final Rules|last=Environmental Protection Agency|first=|date=|website=EPA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to Section 202 of the CAA, and GHGs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of Part C of Title I of the Act. The EPA's auto emission standards for greenhouse gas emissions issued in 2010 and 2012 are intended to cut emissions from targeted vehicles by half, double fuel economy of passenger cars and light-duty trucks by 2025 and save over $4 billion barrels of oil and $1.7 trillion for consumers. The agency has also proposed a two-phase program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for medium and heavy duty trucks and buses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Below is a table for the sources of greenhouse gases, taken from data in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2010). [http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/508_Complete_GHG_1990_2008.pdf "Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2008."] Document no. 430-R-10-006. Office of Atmospheric Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all greenhouse gases, about 76 percent of the sources are manageable under the CAA, marked with an asterisk (*). All others are regulated independently, if at all.

== Clean Air Act and environmental justice ==
By promoting pollution reduction, the Clean Air Act can help reduce heightened exposure to air pollution among communities of color and low-income communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/air-pollution-current-and-future-challenges|title=Air Pollution: Current and Future Challenges|last=EPA, OAR|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-18|date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental researcher Dr. Marie Lynn Miranda notes that African American populations are “consistently over represented” in areas with the poorest air quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miranda|first=Marie Lynn|last2=Edwards|first2=Sharon E.|last3=Keating|first3=Martha H.|last4=Paul|first4=Christopher J.|date=2017-04-18|title=Making the Environmental Justice Grade: The Relative Burden of Air Pollution Exposure in the United States|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=8|issue=6|pages=1755–1771|doi=10.3390/ijerph8061755|issn=1661-7827|pmc=3137995|pmid=21776200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dense populations of low-income and minority communities inhabit the most polluted areas across the United States, which is considered to exacerbate health problems among these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/education_materials/modules/Environmental_Justice.pdf|title=Environmental Justice: Income, Race, and Health|last=Massey|first=Rachel|date=2004|website=Tufts University Global Development And Environment Institute, Tufts University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High levels of exposure to air pollution is linked to several health conditions, including asthma, cancer, premature death, and infant mortality, each of which disproportionately impact communities of color and low-income communities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-04/documents/advancingejthroughp2.pdf|title=ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE THROUGH POLLUTION PREVENTION A Report developed from the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council Meeting of December 9-13, 2002|author=A Federal Advisory Committee to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|date=2002|website=Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pollution reduction achieved by the Clean Air Act is associated with a decline in each of these conditions and can promote environmental justice for communities that are disproportionately impacted by air pollution and diminished health status.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Clean Air Act violations ==
The EPA analyzes violators of the Clean Air Act and addresses the violators accordingly. For companies or parties that do not comply with the act monetary penalties can be cited. Per day the EPA could fine civil administrators $37,500 per day, with a maximum of about 8 days; unless otherwise mandated by the EPA. For a field citation which is against federal facilities which are not abiding by EPA standards can get fines up to $7,500 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/clean-air-act-caa-and-federal-facilities|title=Clean Air Act (CAA) and Federal Facilities |last= |first=|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08|date=2013-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major cases of Clean Air Act violations include:

* The [[Volkswagen emissions scandal]] (2015);
* [[Caterpillar Inc.#Clean Air Act violation|Caterpillar]] and five other manufacturers violated diesel engine emission standards (consent decree, July 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[[Caterpillar Inc.#Clean Air Act violation|Caterpillar Inc.#Clean Air Act violation &lt;span class="CMY_Response"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="CMY_Response"&gt;404&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}
* Alleged violations by Hyundai and Kia which resulted in a total $100 million in civil penalties paid to the United States and to the California Air Resources Board.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-11/documents/hyundai-kia-cd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A 2017 study found that the Clean Air Act of 1970 led to an over 10 percent reduction in pollution ("ambient TSP levels") in counties that exceeded the pollution thresholds set by the Act in the three years after the regulation went into effect. The study found that this regulation-induced reduction in air pollution is caused affected workers to work more and earned one percent more in annual earnings. The authors estimate that cumulative lifetime income gain for each affected individual is approximately $4,300 in present value terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Isen |first=Adam |last2=Rossin-Slater |first2=Maya |last3=Walker |first3=W.

In addition, because air quality across the United States improved; it is estimated 205,000 premature deaths and millions of other respiratory complications were prevented which resulted in an economic savings of $50 trillion versus the $523 billion invested to meet the Clean Air Act standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Kristie|last2=Chmiel|first2=James F.|last3=Ferkol|first3=Thomas|date=November 2012|title=The impact of the Clean Air Act|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4133758/|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=161|issue=5|pages=781–786|doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.06.064|issn=0022-3476|pmc=4133758|pmid=22920509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile sources including automobiles, trains, and boat engines have become 99% cleaner for pollutants like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particle emissions since the 1970s. The allowable emissions of volatile organic chemicals, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and lead from individual cars have also been reduced by more than 90%, resulting in decreased national emissions of these pollutants despite a more than 400% increase in total miles driven yearly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since the 1980s, 1/4th of ground level ozone has been cut, mercury emissions have been cut by 80%, and since the change from leaded gas to unleaded gas 90% of atmospheric lead pollution has been reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/solutions/reduce-emissions/the-clean-air-act.html#.W5MPF5NKjow|title=The Clean Air Act|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-09-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study found that the Clean Air Act contributed to the 60% decline in pollution emissions by the manufacturing industry between 1990 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2018/08/09/environmental-regulations-drove-steep-declines-in-u-s-factory-pollution/ |title=Environmental regulations drove steep declines in U.S. factory pollution |date=2018-08-09 |work=Berkeley News |access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Joseph S. |last2=Walker |first2=Reed |title=Why is Pollution from U.S. Manufacturing Declining?

== Future challenges ==
Climate change poses a challenge to the management of conventional air pollutants in the United States due to warmer, dryer summer conditions that can lead to increased air stagnation episodes. Prolonged droughts that may contribute to wildfires would also result in regionally high levels of air particles.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/air.pdf “Cleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. September 2017. Pages 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, some US cities still don’t meet all national ambient air quality standards. It is likely that tens of thousands of premature deaths are still being caused by fine-particle pollution and ground-level ozone pollution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Air pollution is not bound to a nation. Often, air coming into the U.S. contains pollution from upwind countries, making it harder to meet air quality standards. In turn, air that travels downwind of the U.S. likely has pollutants in it already. Addressing this may require international negotiations of reductions of pollutants in the originating countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This also relates to the challenge of climate change.

== Criticism ==
Diane Katz, a research fellow for the Heritage Foundation, criticized the validity of the Clean Air Act by stating, "The largest proportion of economic benefit is based on the value of avoiding premature mortality. Yet the valuation of this benefit ranks among the most significant uncertainties in the study, according to the researchers. Alternative estimates they cite would lower the benefit calculation by up to 22 percent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.thomasnet.com/imt/2011/10/31/the-clean-air-act-was-it-worth-the-cost|title=The Clean Air Act - Was It Worth the Cost?|website=news.thomasnet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;The Clean Air Act is a constant battle between current economic benefits versus future cost benefits of both health of the nation, and economy.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The '''Cuba–Jamaica Maritime Boundary Agreement''' is a 1994 [[treaty]] between [[Cuba]] and [[Jamaica]] which [[Boundary delimitation|delimits]] the [[maritime boundary]] between the two island countries.

The treaty was signed in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] on 18 February 1994. The text of the treaty establishes a [[border|boundary]] in the waters above the [[Cayman Trough]] that is 175 [[nautical miles]] long and unusually complex. The boundary consists of 105 straight-line [[ocean|maritime]] segments defined by 106 individual coordinate points. The complexity of the boundary was a result of relatively strict adherence to the principle of forming a border at the precise equidistant line between the two territories. The far western point of the border is an as-yet unconfirmed [[tripoint]] with the [[Cayman Islands]].

The treaty came into force on 18  July 1995 after it was [[ratification|ratified]] by both states. The full name of the treaty is ''Agreement between the Government of the Jamaica and the Government of the 
Republic of Cuba on the delimitation of the maritime boundary between the two States''.

==Name==
Cuba—Jamaica Maritime Border Agreement is an Agreement between the Government of the Jamaica and the Government of the Republic of Cuba on the delimitation of the maritime boundary between the two States

'''Don't Copy That Floppy''' was an anti–[[copyright infringement]] propaganda campaign run by the [[Software Publishers Association]] (SPA) beginning in 1992.&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;{{cite news | title=Don't Copy That Floppy | publisher=[[Future Publishing]] | work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | date=December 2003 | issue=131 | page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video for the campaign, starring [[M. E. Hart]] as "MC Double Def DP," was filmed at [[Cardozo High School (Washington, D.C.)|Cardozo High School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and produced by cooperation between the SPA, the Educational Section Anti-Piracy Committee, and the Copyright Protection Fund, in association with Vilardi Films.&lt;ref name=video&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Copy That Floppy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up863eQKGUI|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups distributed the film for general viewing through [[VHS|VHS tapes]] that were mailed to schools. In later years, the film became a [[viral video]] sensation through websites such as [[YouTube]], where the official page has had over 1,800,000 views {{As of|2018|November|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=video/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;

In May 2009, the [[Software and Information Industry Association]] (formed in 1999 when the [[Software Publishers Association]] merged with the Information Industry Association) released the trailer for a follow-up to ''Don't Copy That Floppy'', called ''Don't Copy That 2'', released on September 9, 2009. The sequel features MC Double Def DP as he continues his crusade against [[Copyright infringement#"Piracy"|"piracy"]] in the digital age.&lt;ref name="SIIA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siia.net/Divisions/IP-Protection-Services/Resources | title=Piracy and Copyright Educational Resources | publisher=The Software &amp;amp; Information Industry Association | accessdate=December 11, 2014 | quote=Start with this fun and educational video starring anti-piracy hero MC Double Def DP (Digital Protecter)of 1992's "Don't Copy That Floppy" fame.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
[[Image:Dontcopythatfloppy.jpg|thumb|The "Disk Protector" showing the title of the campaign during the rap portion of the video.]]

Two teenagers, Jenny (played by [[Marja Allen]]) and Corey (played by Jimmy Todd&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7772175/?ref_=nv_sr_1&lt;/ref&gt;), are playing a [[Video game|game]] on a classroom computer. Corey is exuberantly pushing keys to show the viewer that he is heavily immersed in the game action; Jenny is beating him. Frustrated, he asks for a rematch, but she has an upcoming class and must leave. He decides he will copy the game so that he can play it at home. Upon inserting his blank [[floppy disk]] into the [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Macintosh LC]], a video pops up on the computer. This video is of a [[rapping|rapper]] named MC Double Def DP, the "Disk Protector" (played by M.E. Hart).

The point of the video is the message that [[copyright infringement of software]] will cause the [[video game industry|computer and video game industry]] to lose profit, resulting in halted production of further [[video game|computer games]]. (The games the video chooses as examples—''[[The Oregon Trail (series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', ''[[Tetris]]'', and the ''[[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?]]'' series—were among the most successful and bestselling games of the late-1980s to mid-1990s.)

The [[Hip hop music|rap]] video portion is interspersed with interviews of [[Graphic design|artists]], writers, [[Game programmer|programmers]] and a lawyer. These people are the staff responsible for design of an early version of the game ''[[Neverwinter Nights (AOL game)|Neverwinter Nights]]'' (then an [[America Online]] [[MMORPG]]) and allows them to explain the issue in greater detail:

* Craig Dykstra—America Online—[[Project manager|Manager]] [[Game development|Developer]] [[Technical support|Support]]
* Dave Butler—America Online—[[Technical director|Director]] [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] [[Software Development]]
* Janet Hunter—America Online—[[Seniority|Senior]] [[Systems analysis|Systems Analyst]]
* Ilene Rosenthal—[[Software Publishers Association]]—Attorney

They explain how games are made, indicating that creating a game can involve 20 to 30 people integrating the various parts, and working on [[documentation]], technical support, and marketing. The point they try to raise is that if sales are low, the authors may decide that the game is unpopular and stop making it.

At the end of the video, the DP fades away, leaving Corey and Jenny to decide for themselves whether they will copy the game—they decide against it. Corey, who has some money left over from his summer job, decides that he will buy the game. Jenny agrees and jokes that Corey's game will even come with a [[Video game packaging|manual]].

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' has stated that the film's aesthetic is similar to the TV program ''[[Saved By the Bell]]''. It has also highlighted it as an example of classic bubblegum [[hip-hop]] with long-run staying power.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2009/09/08/dont-copy-that-floppy-dusts-itself-off-for-the-00s/|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|first=Andrew|last=LaVallee|date=September 8, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009|title='Don't Copy That Floppy' Dusts Itself Off for the '00s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The major criticism of the campaign came from educators and the press, who criticized the campaign for only promoting one point of view, instead of a broader scope of the issue of copyright online. That point of view, they argued, was biased because it benefited a specific group (the software publishing industry), and failed to present alternative views such as the [[Free Software movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuebe|first=Alison|title=The Struggle to Teach Virtual Ethics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/0424ethics.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity online==
In the late 2000s, the popularity of the video was revived, but this time as a [[Internet meme|meme]]. Since the creators have always allowed non-commercial copying of the film, it became a viral video after video-sharing sites such as [[Google Video]] and YouTube went online in the mid-2000s. The video first gained popularity on the site [[YTMND]] in 2004 and then gained (and re-gained) widespread YouTube popularity in 2005, 2006, and 2008, sparking user-generated remixes and parodies, and is now considered a popular internet meme.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

== Sequel ==
In May 2009, the [[Software and Information Industry Association]] (SIIA) released the trailer for a follow-up to the original 1992 video, which premiered on September 9, 2009. ''Don't Copy That 2'' features M. E. Hart reprising his role as "MC Double Def DP". The trailer shows armed SWAT police raiding homes and arresting the mothers of would-be pirates. The SIIA website says that "Antipiracy hero MC Double Def DP will return to drop some knowledge on would-be pirates in the sequel to 1992's 'Don't Copy That Floppy.'.&lt;ref name="SIIA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHaAFqoVLtI Don't Copy That Floppy 2 Trailer ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
''Don't Copy That 2'' has received over 543,000 views on YouTube as of March 2, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Copy That 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUCyvw4w_yk|accessdate=March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its release it has been criticized by the press for being out of date, referencing material like the [[Doom (series)|''Doom'' series]] and [[Klingon]] that the current target audience (mostly teenagers) may not be familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Nick|title=Why Rap, Klingons, and Jailhouse-Rape-by-Broomstick Aren't the Best Way To Teach Kids About Piracy|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/blogs/techtonic-shifts/2009/09/10/why-rap-klingons-and-jailhouse-rape-by-broomstick-aren-t-the-best-way-to-teach-kids-about-piracy.html|publisher=The Daily Beast|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828025621/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/blogs/techtonic-shifts/2009/09/10/why-rap-klingons-and-jailhouse-rape-by-broomstick-aren-t-the-best-way-to-teach-kids-about-piracy.html|accessdate=April 29, 2016|archivedate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel was also heavily criticized in the press for misrepresenting the way copyright law is enforced, what types of copying were actually considered "criminal" enough to prompt punishment, and what punishment actually looked like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=SIIA's Sequel To Don't Copy That Floppy Lies About Criminality of Copying|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090707/1120525474.shtml|publisher=TechDirt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East Waynesville Baptist Church''' is a [[Baptist church]] in [[Waynesville, North Carolina|Waynesville]], a small town in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] of Western [[North Carolina]], [[United States of America]]. It is an independent and autonomous member of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina (BSCNC). As of May 2005 it had 100 members.  The church was involved in a 2005 controversy after the pastor allegedly expelled members because of their political views.

==History==
The church was built in 1965.&lt;ref name="Nowell1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/faithvalues/2002267307_church08.html  |date=May 8, 2005 |title=North Carolina church torn by pastor's partisan passion |first1=Paul |last1=Nowell |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] |quote=Members of the congregation said Chandler told them during last year's presidential campaign that anyone who planned to vote for Democratic nominee John Kerry needed to leave the church.|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purge of members==
The church received [[mass media]] attention in May 2005. During a May 2 [[deacon]]s' meeting, its [[pastor]] [[Chan Chandler]] allegedly told any members who had supported [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 United States presidential election to leave.  This statement was reportedly captured on audio tape.&lt;ref name="Chadwick"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4648182 |title=Pastor Accused of Political Partisanship Steps Down |date=May 11, 2005 |work=[[Day to Day]] |first1=Alex |last1=Chadwick |publisher=[[WDET]] [[National Public Radio]] |accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine members of the church, including at least one deacon, left the meeting at that point. Chandler then allegedly declared an impromptu business meeting, and a majority of the 20 church members present voted to expel those who left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citizen-times.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050507/NEWS01/50506036/1001 |title=Members say church ousts Kerry supporters |location=Asheville, North Carolina |newspaper=[[Citizen-Times]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler had been vocal in earlier months that he considered voting for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] tantamount to supporting [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]]. Forty church members threatened to terminate their membership in protest against the actions taken at the meeting.&lt;ref name="Dewan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Political Split Leaves Church Sadder and Greyer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 16, 2005 |first1=Shaila |last1=Dewan |location=Waynesville, North Carolina |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/16/us/political-split-leaves-a-church-sadder-and-grayer.html?_r=0 |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodridguez"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/07/AR2005050700972.html |title=N.C.

The BSCNC called the actions attributed to the church leadership "highly irregular" and warned that they could threaten the church's [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt status]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/09/AR2005050901026.html Politics Prompt Church Tax Questions] Washington Post  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904231957/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/09/AR2005050901026.html |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups campaigning for [[church-state separation]] called for the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to consider removing the church's tax-exempt status on the grounds that it engaged in political advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bscnc.org/insidebscnc/pressroomnewsletters/membersousted.htm East Waynesville Action 'Highly Irregular'] North Carolina Baptists  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050512081539/http://www.bscnc.org/insidebscnc/pressroomnewsletters/membersousted.htm |date=May 12, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/20/opinion/le-sunday20.2 |title=Politics in the church pews |first1=Larry |last1=Tamblyn |first2=Ellen P. |last2=April |date=

He noted, however, that the parish suffered from a demographic split.  Dubbing it "Chandlergate" he noted that according to the ''Raleigh News and Observer'', 35 Chandler followers left the sanctuary when Chandler resigned.&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/mayweb-only/31.0a.html |title=Baptist Pastor Accused of Expelling Kerry Voters Quits |first1=Ted |last1=Olsen |date=April 13, 2006 |quote="For me to remain now would only cause more hurt for me and my family," he said at a special business meeting last night.

"I am resigning with gratitude in my heart for all of you, particularly those of you who love me and my family." |accessdate=October 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In speaking to the ''[[Baptist Press]]'', Chandler attempted "to clarify whether the nine people were in fact voted out of the church, Chandler said they initially left voluntarily."  He also told the Baptist Press: "I don't know how these folks voted," Chandler told Baptist Press. "And I never endorsed any candidate." But he admits he preached about the "unbiblical values" of John Kerry, particularly in regard to abortion and homosexuality.

The '''Enten controversy''' involved [[Kazutsugi Nami]], the chairman of Tokyo bedding supplier Ladies &amp; Gentlemen (L&amp;G), arrested by Japanese police on 5 February 2009. He and twenty-one other executives were accused of defrauding 37,000 investors of at least 126&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;[[yen]]&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bedding company chairman, workers nabbed over massive investment scandal |work=[[Mainichi Shimbun|The Mainichi Daily News]] |date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2009 |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090205p2a00m0na014000c.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206082502/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20090205p2a00m0na014000c.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately [[US Dollar|US$]]1.4&amp;nbsp;billion) between 2001 and 2009.&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7871237.stm|title=Chairman arrested in Japan 'scam'|date= 5 February 2009 |accessdate= 5 February 2009 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nami is the inventor of a quasi-currency, "Enten", which he used to attract investors. Some sources put the total amount of the money involved as high as 226&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;yen, which would make it, if proven, to be the biggest investment fraud in Japanese history since Toyota Shoji, an investment group, defrauded investors of 202.5&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;yen in the late '80s.&lt;ref name="guardian20090205"&gt;{{citeweb | url = https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/05/japan-kazutsugi-nami-ladies-gentlemen | title = Arrests made in what could be biggest investment scam in Japanese history | first = Justin | last = McCurry | date = 5 February 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2009 | publisher = ''[[The Guardian]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to gain credibility and popularity, Nami's company used famous [[enka]] singers such as [[Takashi Hosokawa]] in their advertisements. In May 2008, Hosokawa was accused on the Japanese civil court for participating, but he insisted that he was not responsible for the content of their advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?sec=1&amp;id=3820|title=Japanese businessman arrested in investment scam|publisher=[[Asia News Network]]|date=2009-02-06|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; Nami had been issuing special electronic money which he referred to as {{nihongo|''Enten''|円天|extra=a combination of the Japanese currency name, [[Japanese yen|yen]], and the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for ''[[wikt:天|heaven]]''&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt;}} to investors who paid at least [[Japanese yen|¥]]100,000 (approx. £750, US$1,100). Enten was a [[Virtual economy|virtual currency]] which Nami expected to become [[legal tender]] in the post-recession by which time he will also have become "world famous."&lt;ref name="guardian20090205"/&gt; Investors were promised 36% [[Rate of return|annual returns]].&lt;ref name="smh20090205"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/japanese-man-arrested-over-14bndlr-investment-scam-20090205-7yrp.html|title=Japanese man arrested over 1.4-bn-dlr investment scam|date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2009 |publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was even an "Enten fair" during which participants sang the praises of Nami's investment plan.&lt;ref name="smh20090205"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt; One woman described the existence of Enten as "wonderful", whilst another said: "It's like a dream, I can buy anything."&lt;ref name="smh20090205"/&gt;

"Enten" were generated through his customers' mobile phones and could be used to purchase items online, including vegetables, [[futon]]s, clothing and jewelry.&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt; In February 2007, L&amp;G dividends were distributed in Enten, rather than in cash, which caused many lawsuits and cancellations of accounts.&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; In October 2007, police searched L&amp;G's headquarters in Tokyo, suspecting that the company had violated investment laws.&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy in November 2007.&lt;ref name="mainichi20090205"/&gt; 

Nami denies allegations of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt; He had built up a [[cult]]-like following amongst his investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japanese man arrested over 1.4-bn-dlr investment scam |work=[[Agence France Presse]] |publisher=Google News |accessdate=|date=5 February 2009 |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hhaToshJ4mZc5I7NtTtaDaGwifaA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers representing these victims say Nami believed he had a "divine decree" to "eliminate poverty from this world."&lt;ref name="bbc20090205"/&gt;

[[File:IPhone 5c blue back.jpg|thumb|alt=Rear side of blue iPhone 5c.|right|An [[iPhone 5C]], the model used by one of the perpetrators of the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]]]]

The '''FBI–Apple encryption dispute''' concerns whether and to what extent courts in the [[United States]] can compel manufacturers to assist in unlocking [[cell phone]]s whose [[data]] are [[Cryptography|cryptographically protected]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4262480/tim-cook-apple-fbi-2/|title=Inside Apple CEO Tim Cook's Fight With the FBI|first=Lev|last=Grossman|work=Time|date=March 17, 2016|accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is much debate over public access to strong encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/technology/apple-iphone-fbi-justice-department-case.html|title=U.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple|first=Katie|last=Benner|first2=Eric|last2=Lichtblau|work=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2016|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 and 2016, [[Apple Inc.]] has received and objected to or challenged at least 11 orders issued by [[United States district court]]s under the [[All Writs Act]] of 1789. Most of these seek to compel Apple "to use its existing capabilities to extract data like contacts, photos and calls from locked [[iPhone]]s running on operating systems [[iOS 7]] and older" in order to assist in criminal investigations and prosecutions. A few requests, however, involve phones with more extensive security protections, which Apple has no current ability to break. These orders would compel Apple to write new software that would let the government bypass these devices' security and unlock the phones.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/02/23/new-court-filing-reveals-apple-faces-12-other-requests-to-break-into-locked-iphones/|title=New Court Filing Reveals Apple Faces 12 Other Requests to Break Into Locked iPhones|work=The Intercept|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016|first=Jenna|last=McLaughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known instance of the latter category was a February 2016 court case in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]]. The FBI wanted Apple to create and [[digital signature|electronically sign]] new software that would enable the FBI to unlock a work-issued [[iPhone 5C]] it recovered from one of the shooters who, in [[2015 San Bernardino attack|a December 2015 terrorist attack]] in [[San Bernardino, California]], killed 14 people and injured 22. The two attackers later died in a shootout with police, having first destroyed their personal phones. The work phone was recovered intact but was locked with a four-digit password and was set to eliminate all its data after ten failed password attempts. Apple declined to create the software, and a hearing was scheduled for March 22. However, a day before the hearing was supposed to happen, the government obtained a delay, saying they had found a third party able to assist in unlocking the iPhone and, on March 28, it announced that the FBI had unlocked the iPhone and withdrew its request. In March 2018, the [[Los Angeles Times]] later reported "the FBI eventually found that Farook's phone had information only about work and revealed nothing about the plot."&lt;ref name="access delayed"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-fbi-iphone-san-bernardino-20180327-story.html|title=Race to unlock San Bernardino shooter's iPhone was delayed by poor FBI communication, report finds|last=Tanfani|first=Joseph|date=March 27, 2018|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case in Brooklyn, a magistrate judge ruled that the [[All Writs Act]] could not be used to compel Apple to unlock an iPhone. The government appealed the ruling, but then dropped the case on April 22 after it was given the correct passcode.

In 1993, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) introduced the [[Clipper chip]], an encryption device with an acknowledged [[backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] for government access, that NSA proposed be used for phone encryption.

It was revealed as a part of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] by [[Edward Snowden]] that the NSA and the British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) had access to the user data in iPhones, [[BlackBerry]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones and could read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes.&lt;ref name="spiegel20130907"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-920971.html|title=Privacy Scandal: NSA Can Spy on Smart Phone Data|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Apple developed new encryption methods for its [[iOS]] operating system, versions 8 and later, "so deep that Apple could no longer comply with government warrants asking for customer information to be extracted from devices."&lt;ref name=postsnowden&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html|title= Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A.|date=September 27, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2016|first=David E.|last=Sanger|first2=Brian X.|last2=Chen|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2015, prosecutors advocated for the U.S. government to be able to compel decryption of iPhone contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/07/manhattan-da-iphone-crypto-foiled-cops-74-times/|title=Manhattan DA: iPhone Crypto Locked Out Cops 74 Times|date=July 8, 2015|accessdate=February 25, 2016|magazine=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/encrypted-smartphones-challenge-investigators-1444692995|title=Encrypted Smartphones Challenge Investigators|first=Cat|last=Zakrzewski|date=October 12, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/08/12/prosecutors-press-on-with-think-of-the-children-campaign-against-encryption-in-ios-android|title=Prosecutors press on with 'think of the children' campaign against encryption in iOS, Android|date=August 12, 2015|work=AppleInsider|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-18/n-y-prosecutor-calls-for-phone-access-in-wake-of-paris-attacks|title=Apple, Google Urged to Crack Encrypted Phones in Terror Probes|first1=Tiffany|last1=Kary|first2=Chris|last2=Dolmetsch|date=November 18, 2015|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Apple released a white paper detailing the security measures in its then-new iOS 9 operating system. The iPhone 5C model can be protected by a four-digit [[Personal identification number|PIN]] code. After more than ten incorrect attempts to unlock the phone with the wrong PIN, the contents of the phone will be rendered inaccessible by erasing the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] [[encryption key]] that protects its stored data. According to the Apple white paper, iOS includes a [[Device Firmware Upgrade]] (DFU) mode, and that "[r]estoring a device after it enters DFU mode returns it to a known good state with the certainty that only unmodified Apple-signed code is present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf|title=iOS Security—Version 9 or later|work=Apple Inc.|date=September 2015|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Apple ordered to assist the FBI ==
The FBI recovered an Apple [[iPhone 5C]]—owned by the [[San Bernardino County, California]] government—that had been issued to its employee, [[Syed]] [[Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik|Rizwan Farook]], one of the shooters involved in the December [[2015 San Bernardino attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-wants-apple-to-help-unlock-iphone-used-by-san-bernardino-shooter/2016/02/16/69b903ee-d4d9-11e5-9823-02b905009f99_story.html|title=Apple vows to resist FBI demand to crack iPhone linked to San Bernardino attacks|work=The Washington Post|date=February 17, 2016|accessdate=February 18, 2016|first=Ellen|last=Nakashima}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack killed 14 people and seriously injured 22.

On February 9, 2016, the FBI announced that it was unable to unlock the county-owned phone it recovered, due to its advanced security features, including encryption of user data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-shooting-encryption-idUSKCN0VI22A|title=FBI director says investigators unable to unlock San Bernardino shooter's phone content|work=Reuters|date=February 9, 2016|accessdate=March 31, 2016|first=Dustin|last=Volz|first2=Mark|last2=Hosenball}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/washington-794488-help-killer.html|title=SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING: Apple must help US hack killer's phone|work=The Press-Enterprise|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016|first=Tami|last=Abdollah|first2=Eric|last2=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI first asked the [[National Security Agency]] to break into the phone, but they were unable to since they only had knowledge of breaking into other devices that are commonly used by criminals, and not iPhones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/nsa-comes-clean-on-why-it-couldnt-hack-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone/|title=NSA finally admits why it couldn't hack San Bernardino shooter's iPhone|work=ZDNet|date=June 10, 2016|accessdate=June 11, 2016|first=Zack|last=Whittaker}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the FBI asked [[Apple Inc.]] to create a new version of the phone's [[iOS]] [[operating system]] that could be installed and run in the phone's [[random access memory]] to disable certain security features that Apple refers to as "GovtOS". Apple declined due to its policy which required it to never undermine the security features of its products. The FBI responded by successfully applying to a [[United States magistrate judge]], Sheri Pym, to issue a court order, mandating Apple to create and provide the requested software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/san-bernardino-shooting/judge-forces-apple-help-unlock-san-bernardino-shooter-iphone-n519701|title=Judge Forces Apple to Help Unlock San Bernardino Shooter iPhone|work=NBC News|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 16, 2016|first=Andrew|last=Blankstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order was not a [[subpoena]], but rather was issued under the [[All Writs Act of 1789]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert M.|last=Chesney|url=https://lawfareblog.com/apple-vs-fbi-going-dark-dispute-moves-congress-courtroom|title=Apple vs FBI: The Going Dark Dispute Moves from Congress to the Courtroom|work=Lawfare|date=February 17, 2016|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Full Explanation of Court Order to Apple to Unlock San Bernardino Shooters' iPhone and Apple Refusal (Full text of court order and Tim Cook's letter included) |first=Anne P. |last=Mitchell |url=http://www.theinternetpatrol.com/full-explanation-of-court-order-to-apple-to-unlock-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone-and-apple-refusal-full-text-of-court-order-and-tim-cooks-letter-included/ |publisher=The Internet Patrol |date=February 17, 2016 |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court order, called ''In the Matter of the Search of an Apple iPhone Seized During the Execution of a Search Warrant on a Black Lexus IS300, California License Plate 35KGD203'', was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Docket for USA v.

The use of the [[All Writs Act]] to compel Apple to write new software was unprecedented and, according to legal experts, it was likely to prompt "an epic fight pitting privacy against national security."&lt;ref name="DolanKimAllWrits"&gt;{{cite web|first=Maura|last=Dolan|first2=Victoria|last2=Kim|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-me-fbi-apple-legal-20160219-story.html|title=Apple-FBI fight over iPhone encryption pits privacy against national security|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also pointed out that the implications of the legal precedent that would be established by the success of this action against Apple would go far beyond issues of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Davidson|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/a-dangerous-all-writ-precedent-in-the-apple-case|title=The Dangerous All Writs Act Precedent in the Apple Encryption Case|work=New Yorker|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical details of the order ===
The court order specified that Apple provide assistance to accomplish the following:
# "it will bypass or disable the auto-erase function whether or not it has been enabled"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (this user-configurable feature of iOS 8 automatically deletes keys needed to read encrypted data after ten consecutive incorrect attempts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2722199/5-15-MJ-00451-SP-USA-v-Black-Lexus-IS300.pdf|title=APPLE INC'S MOTION TO VACATE|last=Boutrous, Jr.|first=Theodore J.|date=February 25, 2016|website=Documentcloud|page=51|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
# "it will enable the FBI to submit passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE for testing electronically via the physical device port, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or other protocol available"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# "it will ensure that when the FBI submits passcodes to the SUBJECT DEVICE, software running on the device will not purposefully introduce any additional delay between passcode attempts beyond what is incurred by Apple hardware"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
The order also specifies that Apple's assistance may include providing software to the FBI that "will be coded by Apple with a unique identifier of the phone so that the [software] would only load and execute on the SUBJECT DEVICE"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There has been much research and analysis of the technical issues presented in the case since the court order was made available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.readysignon.com/step-step-technical-analysis-fbis-case-compelling-apple-unlock-san-bernardino-shooters-iphone/|title=Analyzing the FBI case against Apple: A technical review|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|work=ReadySignOn|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apple's opposition to the order ===
The February 16, 2016 order issued by Magistrate Judge Pym gave Apple five days to apply for relief if Apple believed the order was "unreasonably burdensome". Apple announced its intent to oppose the order, citing the security risks that the creation of a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] would pose towards customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/16/us/san-bernardino-shooter-phone-apple/|title=Apple opposes judge's order to hack San Bernardino shooter's iPhone|publisher=CNN|date=February 17, 2016|accessdate=February 17, 2016|first=Evan|last=Perez|first2=Tim|last2=Hume}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated that no government had ever asked for similar access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/19/apple-fbi-encryption-battle-san-bernardino-shooting-syed-farook-iphone|title=Apple says the FBI is making access demands even China hasn't asked for|work=The Guardian|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=February 20, 2016|first=Danny|last=Yadron}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was given until February 26 to fully respond to the court order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/apple-794741-time-bernardino.html|title=SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING: Apple gets more time to file its response|work=The Press-Enterprise|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/21/technology/apple-fbi-tuesday/index.html|title=Apple will battle the FBI in court Tuesday|last=Pagliery|first=Jose|work=CNN Money|date=March 21, 2016|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day the order was issued, [[chief executive officer]] [[Tim Cook]] released an online statement to Apple customers, explaining the company's motives for opposing the court order. He also stated that while they respect the FBI, the request they made threatens data security by establishing a precedent that the U.S. government could use to force any technology company to create software that could undermine the security of its products.&lt;ref name=AppleCook&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/|title=A Message to Our Customers|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=February 16, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016|first=Tim|last=Cook}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said in part:

{{quote|The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers. We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand. This moment calls for public discussion, and we want our customers and people around the country to understand what is at stake.&lt;ref name=AppleCook/&gt;}}

In response to the opposition, on February 19, the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] filed a new application urging a federal judge to compel Apple to comply with the order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/doj-escalates-battle-apple-san-bernardino-shooters-phone/story?id=37056775|title=DOJ Escalates Battle With Apple Over San Bernardino Shooter's Phone|publisher=ABC News|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016|first=Mike|last=Levine|first2=Jack|last2=Date|first3=Jack|last3=Cloherty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new application stated that the company could install the software on the phone in its own premises, and after the FBI had hacked the phone via remote connection, Apple could remove and destroy the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/02/19/57752/san-bernardino-justice-department-files-new-motion|title=San Bernardino shooting: US says Apple could keep, destroy software to help FBI hack iPhone|agency=Associated Press|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple hired attorneys [[Ted Olson]] and Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. to fight the order on appeal.&lt;ref name="DolanKimAllWrits" /&gt;

The same day, Apple revealed that it had discussed with the FBI four methods to access data in the iPhone in early January, but, as was revealed by a footnote in the February 19 application to the court, one of the more promising methods was ruled out by a mistake during the investigation of the attack. After the shooter's phone had been recovered, the FBI asked San Bernardino County, the owner of the phone, to reset the password to the shooter's [[iCloud]] account in order to acquire data from the iCloud backup. However, this rendered the phone unable to backup recent data to iCloud unless its pass-code is entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tn-apple-fbi-call-20160219-story.html|title=Apple and feds reveal San Bernardino shooter's iCloud password was reset hours after attack|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2016|first=Paresh|last=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/gma/san-bernardino-shooters-apple-id-passcode-changed-while-234003785--abc-news-topstories.html|title=San Bernardino Shooter's Apple ID Passcode Changed While in Government Possession, Apple Says|work=Yahoo!

=== Legal arguments ===
The government cites as precedent ''[[United States v. New York Telephone Co.]]'', in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1977 that the All Writs Act gave courts the power to demand reasonable technical assistance from the phone company in accessing phone calling records. Apple responded that New York Telephone was already collecting the data in question in the course of its business, something the Supreme Court took note of in its ruling. Apple also asserts that being compelled to write new software "amounts to compelled speech and viewpoint discrimination in violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. ... What is to stop the government from demanding that Apple write code to turn on the microphone in aid of government surveillance, activate the video camera, surreptitiously record conversations, or turn on location services to track the phone's user?" Apple argued that the FBI had not made use of all of the government's tools, such as employing the resources of the NSA. A hearing on the case was scheduled for March 22, 2016.&lt;ref name=wired216&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/02/apple-brief-fbi-response-iphone/|title=Apple to FBI: You Can't Force Us to Hack the San Bernardino iPhone|first=Kim|last=Zetter|first2=Brian|last2=Barrett|magazine=Wired|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 7, FBI Director [[James Comey]] said that the tool used can only unlock an iPhone 5C like that used by the San Bernardino shooter, as well as older iPhone models lacking the [[Touch ID]] sensor.

Some news outlets, citing anonymous sources, identified the third party as Israeli company [[Cellebrite]]. However, ''The Washington Post'' reported that, according to anonymous "people familiar with the matter", the FBI had instead paid "professional hackers" who used a [[Zero-day (computing)|zero-day]] vulnerability in the iPhone's software to bypass its ten-try limitation, and did not need Cellebrite's assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ellen|last=Nakashima|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-paid-professional-hackers-one-time-fee-to-crack-san-bernardino-iphone/2016/04/12/5397814a-00de-11e6-9d36-33d198ea26c5_story.html|title=FBI paid professional hackers one-time fee to crack San Bernardino iPhone|work=The Washington Post|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbgadget.com/2016/03/government-keeping-his-technique-to.html|title=Government keeping his technique to crack San Bernardino iPhone 'classified'|website=www.mbgadget.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the San Bernardino case and the Brooklyn case, Apple has received at least nine different requests from federal courts under the All Writs Act for iPhone or [[iPad]] products. Apple has objected to these requests. This fact was revealed by Apple in court filings in the Brooklyn case made at the request of the judge in that case. Most of these requests call upon Apple "to use its existing capabilities to extract data like contacts, photos and calls from locked iPhones running on operating systems iOS7 and older" (as in the Brooklyn case), while others "involve phones with more extensive encryption, which Apple cannot break" and presumably seek to order Apple to "design new software to let the government circumvent the device's security protocols and unlock the phone" (as in the San Bernardino case).&lt;ref name="McLaughlin"/&gt;

With Apple's privacy policy for the customers there is no way of getting into a phone without a person's master password. With this policy there will be no backdoor access on the phone for the law enforcement to access the person's private information. This has caused a great dispute between the FBI and Apple's encryption.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Apple has closed this backdoor for the law enforcement because they believe that by creating this backdoor it would make it easier for law enforcement, and also make it easier for criminal hackers to gain access to people's personal data on their phone. Former FBI director [[James Comey]] says that "We are drifting to a place in this country where there will be zones that are beyond the reach of the law."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He believes that this backdoor access is crucial to  investigations, and without it many criminals will not be convicted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On February 23, 2016, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/3559f46e-d9c5-11e5-98fd-06d75973fe09.html#axzz417MxjWob|title=Gates breaks ranks over FBI Apple request|first=Stephen|last=Foley|first2=Tim|last2=Bradshaw|work=Financial Times|date=February 23, 2016|accessdate=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Bill Gates]], founder of Microsoft, has sided with the FBI in the case.

San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said in an interview:

{{quote|I'll be honest with you, I think that there is a reasonably good chance that there is nothing of any value on the phone. What we are hoping might be on the phone would be potential contacts that we would obviously want to talk to. This is an effort to leave no stone unturned in the investigation. [To] allow this phone to sit there and not make an effort to get the information or the data that may be inside of that phone is simply not fair to the victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/26/468216198/san-bernardino-police-chief-weighs-in-on-whether-apple-should-unlock-shooter-s-p|title=San Bernardino Police Chief Sees Chance Nothing of Value On Shooter's iPhone|publisher=NPR|date=February 26, 2016|accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Manhattan District Attorney]] [[Cyrus Vance, Jr.]], said that he wants Apple to unlock 175 iPhones that his office's [[Cyber-Crime Lab]] has been unable to access, adding, "Apple should be directed to be able to unlock its phones when there is a court order by an independent judge proving and demonstrating that there's relevant evidence on that phone necessary for an individual case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/02/21/467547180/it-s-not-just-the-iphone-law-enforcement-wants-to-unlock|title=It's Not Just The iPhone Law Enforcement Wants To Unlock|publisher=NPR|date=February 21, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI Director Comey, testifying before the [[House Judiciary Committee]], compared Apple's iPhone security to a [[guard dog]], saying, "We're asking Apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us [[Lockpicking|pick the lock]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/03/01/apple-fbi-stake-out-competing-sides-in-encryption-debate|title=Apple clash before Congress as encryption fight simmers|first=Tami|last=Abdollah|first2=Larry|last2=Neumeister|publisher=CBS News|date=March 1, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apples [[iOS 8]] software has encryption mechanisms that make it difficult for the government to get through. Apple provided no backdoor for surveillance without the company's discretion. However, Comey stated that he did not want a backdoor method of surveillance and that "We want to use the front door, with clarity and transparency, and with clear guidance provided by law." He believes that special access is required in order to stop criminals such as "terrorists and child molesters". Many companies such as Apple would not give the U.S. access due to the policies Apple has in place on users' confidentiality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/fbi-director-demands-access-to-private-cell-phone-data/|title=FBI director demands access to private cell phone data|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|date=October 16, 2014|work=Cnet|accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calls for compromise ===

[[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Ashton Carter]] called for Silicon Valley and the federal government to work together. "We are squarely behind strong data security and strong encryption, no question about it," he said. Carter also added that he is "not a believer in back doors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/03/02/secretary-defense-encryption-back-doors/|title=Defense Secretary Says He Is For Encryption And Against Back Doors|work=Fortune|first=Jonathan|last=Vanian|date=March 2, 2016|accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address to the 2016 [[South by Southwest]] conference on March 11, President [[Barack Obama]] stated that while he could not comment on the specific case, "You cannot take an absolutist view on [encryption]. If your view is strong encryption no matter what, and we can and should create black boxes, that does not strike the balance that we've lived with for 200 or 300 years.

=== Proposed legislation ===
On April 13, U.S. Senators [[Richard Burr]] and [[Dianne Feinstein]], the Republican Chair and senior Democrat on the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]], respectively, released draft legislation that would authorize state and federal judges to order "any person who provides a product or method to facilitate a communication or the processing or storage of data" to provide data in intelligible form or technical assistance in unlocking encrypted data and that any such person who distributes software or devices must ensure they are capable of complying with such an order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-legislation-idUSKCN0X52CG|title=Leak of Senate encryption bill prompts swift backlash|first=Dustin|last=Volz|first2=Mark|last2=Hosenball|work=Reuters|date=April 8, 2016|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-senate-panel-releases-draft-192224282.html|title=U.S. Senate panel releases draft of controversial encryption bill|first=Mark|last=Hosenball|first2=Dustin|last2=Volz|publisher=Yahoo!

== Inspector General Investigation ==

=== Background ===
On August 31, 2016 Amy Hess, the FBI's Executive Assistant Director, raised concerns with the [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|Office of Inspector General]] alleging there was a disagreement between units of the Operational Technology Division (OTD) of their capability to access Farook's iPhone; namely between the Cryptographic and Electronic Analysis Unit (CEAU) and the Remote Operations Unit (ROU). She also alleged that some OTD officials were indifferent to FBI leadership (herself included)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/testimony/deciphering-the-debate-over-encryption|title=Statement Before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation Washington, D.C.|last=Hess|first=Amy|date=April 19, 2016|website=fbi.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving possibly misleading testimony to Congress and in court orders that they had no such capability.

=== Findings ===
Ultimately, the Inspector General's March 2018 report&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2018/o1803.pdf|title=A Special Inquiry Regarding the Accuracy of FBI Statements Concerning its Capabilities to Exploit an iPhone Seized During the San Bernardino Terror Attack Investigation|last=|first=|date=|website=oig.justice.gov|publisher=Office of the Inspector General, US Department of Justice|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; found no evidence that the OTD had withheld knowledge of the ability to unlock Farook's iPhone at the time of Director Comey's congressional testimony of February 9 and March 1, 2016. However, the report also found that poor communication and coordination between the CEAU and ROU meant that "not all relevant personnel had been engaged at the outset".

The ROU Chief (named by [[Vice Media|Vice]] to be Eric Chuang)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7xdxg9/fbi-hacking-investigations-classified-remote-operations-unit|title=The FBI Used Classified Hacking Tools in Ordinary Criminal Investigations|last=Cox|first=Joseph|date=March 29, 2018|work=Motherboard|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; said he only became aware of the access problem after a February 11 meeting of the Digital Forensics and Analysis Section (DFAS) - of which the ROU is not a member. While the OTD directors were in frequent contact during the investigation, including discussions about Farook's iPhone, Asst. Dir. Stephen Richardson and the Chief of DFAS, John F. Bennett, believed at the time that a court order was their only alternative.

Chuang claimed the CEAU Chief didn't ask for their help due to a "line in the sand" against using classified security tools in domestic criminal cases.{{efn|Eric Chuang appears to be referring to a January 2002 memo requiring approval from the Deputy Attorney General to grant use for classified tools in criminal cases. While Chuang was aware of two previous cases where they were used, he claimed this infrequency proved that using such techniques was "difficult"."}} The CEAU Chief denied such a line existed and that not using classified techniques was merely a preference. Nevertheless, the perception of this line resulted in the ROU not getting involved until after John Bennett's February 11 meeting asking "anyone" in the bureau to help.

Once Chuang "got the word out", he soon learned that a trusted vendor was "almost 90 percent of the way" to a solution after "many months" of work and asked they prioritize its completion. The unnamed vendor came forward with their solution on March 16, 2016 and successfully demonstrated it to FBI leadership on March 20. The [[United States Attorney|US Attorneys Office]] was informed the next day and they withdrew their court action against Apple on March 28.

When asked why the ROU was not involved earlier the Chief of Technical Surveillance Section (TSS), Eric Chuang's superior, initially said it was not in his "lane" and it was handled exclusively by the DFAS because "that is their mandate". He later claimed that Farook's phone was discussed from the outset but he did not instruct his unit chiefs to contact outside vendors until after February 11. In either event, neither he nor the ROU were asked to request help from their vendors until mid-February. By the time the Attorneys Office filed their February 16 court order, the ROU had only just begun contacting its vendors.

The CEAU Chief was unable to say with certainty that the ROU had been consulted beforehand and that the February 11th meeting was a final "mop-up" before a court action was filed. The CEAU's search for solutions within the FBI was undocumented and was handled informally by a senior engineer that the CEAU Chief personally trusted had checked with "everybody".

On the other hand, it's possible that Hess' asking questions is what prompted the February 11 "mop-up" meeting. During the CEAU's search Hess became concerned that she wasn't getting straight answers from the OTD and that unit chiefs didn't know the capabilities of the others. The Inspector General stated further: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the CEAU Chief may not have been interested in researching all possible solutions and instead focused only on unclassified techniques that could readily be disclosed in court that OTD and its partner agencies already had in-hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Hess and Chuang stated the CEAU Chief seemed not to want to use classified techniques and appeared to have an agenda in pursuing a favorable ruling against Apple. Chuang described the CEAU Chief as "definitely not happy" that the they undermined his legal case against Apple and had vented his frustration with him.

Hess said the CEAU Chief wanted to use the case as a "poster child" to resolve the larger problem with encrypted devices known as the "[[Crypto Wars|Going Dark challenge]]". The challenge is defined by the FBI as "changes in technology [that] hinder law enforcement's ability to exercise investigative tools and follow critical leads".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/operational-technology/going-dark|title=Going Dark|last=|first=|date=|website=fbi.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As The Los Angeles Times reported in March 2018, the FBI was unable to access data from 7,775 seized devices in their investigations. The unidentified method used to unlock Farook's phone - costing more than $1 million to obtain - quit working once Apple updated their operating system.&lt;ref name="access delayed" /&gt;

=== Conclusion ===
The Inspector General's report found that statements in the FBI's testimony before Congress were accurate but relied on assumptions that the OTD units were coordinating effectively from the beginning. They also believe the miscommunication delayed finding a technical solution to accessing Farook's iPhone. The FBI disputed this since the vendor had been working on the project independently "for some time". However, according to Chuang - whom described himself as a "relationship holder" for the vendor - they were not actively working to complete the solution and that it was moved to the "front burner" on his request; to which the TSS Chief agreed.

In response to the Inspector General's report, the FBI intended to add a new OTD section to consolidate resources to address the Going Dark problem and to improve coordination between units.

{{NJmunigov}}
The '''Optional Municipal Charter Law''' or '''Faulkner Act''' ({{Cite NJSA|title=40|chapter=69A|section=1}}, et seq.) provides [[New Jersey]] [[municipalities]] with a variety of models of local government.  This legislation is called the Faulkner Act in honor of the late [[Bayard H. Faulkner]], former mayor of [[Montclair, New Jersey]] and chairman of the [[Commission on Municipal Government]].

==Overview==

The Faulkner Act offers four basic plans ([[mayor–council government|mayor–council]], [[council–manager government|council–manager]], [[Faulkner Act (small municipality)|small municipality]], and [[Faulkner Act (mayor–council–administrator)|mayor–council–administrator]]) and two procedures by which the voters of a municipality can adopt one of these plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=WOLFE|first1=ALBERT J.|title=A HISTORY OF MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT IN NEW JERSEY SINCE 1798|url=http://www.njslom.org/history_municipal_govt.pdf|publisher=New Jersey League of Municipalities|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs. Twenty-one percent of the municipalities in New Jersey, including the six most populous cities ([[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]] and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]]) all govern under the provisions of the Faulkner Act. More than half of all New Jersey residents reside in municipalities with Faulkner Act charters.

In all Faulkner Act municipalities, regardless of the particular form, citizens enjoy the right of [[initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]], meaning that proposed ordinances can be introduced directly by the people without action by the local governing body. This right is exercised by preparing a conforming [[petition]] signed by 10% of the registered voters who turned out in the last general election in an odd-numbered year (i. the most recent [[New Jersey General Assembly|General Assembly]] election). Once the petition is submitted, the local governing body can vote to pass the requested ordinance, and if they refuse, it is then submitted directly to the voters.

==History==

The Faulkner Act was created to provide municipalities with greater flexibility than provided in New Jersey's traditional forms of government ([[city (New Jersey)|city]], [[township (New Jersey)|township]], [[borough (New Jersey)|borough]], [[town (New Jersey)|town]] and [[village (New Jersey)|village]]) and to expand on the reforms provided in the [[Walsh Act (New Jersey)|Walsh Act]] and the [[1923 Municipal Manager Law]].

As originally enacted in 1950, the Faulkner Act provided for three forms of government: mayor–council, council–manager, and small municipality. Within each form, letter codes designated predefined aspects of each form and its individual arrangement of options, such as partisan or nonpartisan elections, concurrent or staggered terms, all at large or a combination of ward and at large seats.

In 1981, the Faulkner Act was significantly amended. The letter codes were eliminated, and the number of varieties within each plan was greatly increased. The council–manager plan was amended to include the option of having a mayor chosen by the electorate. A new form, mayor–council–administrator, was added. Municipalities were also given greater flexibility to amend their Faulkner Act charter without having to place the entire charter on the ballot.

==Forms of government==

There are four forms available to municipalities through the Faulkner Act:

*The [[Faulkner Act (mayor–council)|mayor–council]] form features a mayor with [[Mayor–council government#Strong-mayor form|strong powers]] and a city council with five to nine members. Municipalities under this plan establish three to ten executive departments, headed by a director appointed by the mayor with the consent of the council.
*The [[Faulkner Act (council–manager)|council–manager]] plan places complete responsibility for municipal affairs in the council. The council appoints a municipal manager who is the chief executive with broad authority. While the council–manager plan is quite similar to the [[1923 Municipal Manager Law]], the Faulkner Act version does not provide tenure for the municipal manager, who can be removed by a vote of the council.
*The [[Faulkner Act (small municipality)|small municipality]] plan can be adopted by communities with a population of fewer than 12,000. All legislative powers are vested in the council with the mayor presiding over council sessions and having both voice and vote. The small municipality form is essentially a blend of the features in the traditional [[borough (New Jersey)|borough]] and [[township (New Jersey)|township]] forms of government.
*The [[Faulkner Act (mayor–council–administrator)|mayor–council–administrator]] form is largely the [[borough (New Jersey)|borough]] form with the addition of an appointed professional administrator. Unlike the three other Faulkner Act plans, the mayor–council–administrator offers no optional variations in structure.

In the Netherlands, a '''friendship contract''' (‘''vriendschapscontract''’) is an agreement which regulates the consequences of a ''social relationship'' between two or more persons under family law as well as property law. Such a contract has no prescribed form. From an evidential point of view a written or notarial form is preferred. In addition, parties are in principle (see article 3:40 of the Dutch Civil Code (''Burgerlijk Wetboek'' (BW)) free to determine the content of their agreement. For example, a tangible or intangible duty of care can be established, a power of attorney can be granted in case a party can no longer act on his own behalf, and an arrangement can be made for the event that one party obtains a good that, in whole or in part, is financed with assets of the other. In the Dutch law of persons and family law there are as of yet no legal effects attached to friendship contracts, which is also not expected to happen in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;The Dutch government recently decided to ''not even'' create a regulation for unmarried and unregistered cohabitants.&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship contract is therefore currently governed by the general Dutch contract and property law.

== The first friendship contract ==
The first friendship contract was concluded in the Netherlands between ''best friends'' Joost Janmaat and Christiaan Fruneaux (who do not have a love affair together). The notarised contract was executed before civil-law notary Maarten Meijer on May 7, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' E. Verhagen &amp; C. Mol, ‘Het vriendschapscontract’, in: W. Pintens &amp; C. Declerck (red.), ''Patrimonium 2015'', Brugge: Die Keure 2015 (''forthcoming'').&lt;/ref&gt; This movement stems from the desire to introduce the institute of friendship into Dutch law. Janmaat and Fruneaux believe that friendship is playing an – increasingly – important role in society, which should also be legally recognized in certain areas of law. For example, they have in mind a lower inheritance tax rate for friends and the right not to testify against your best friend. The thought that the family is the ''only'' cornerstone of society is considered passé. Friends are, in practice, more and more on an equal par with family members and/or life partners.

== Public reactions ==
* The chairman of the Dutch Humanist Association (''Humanistisch Verbond''), Boris van der Ham, also calls for the legal recognition of friendship in (and outside) the Netherlands in the members’ magazine ''HUMAN''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanistischverbond.nl/cms/files/human/human1webversie.pdf |format=PDF |title=Human |date=2015 |publisher=Humanistisschverbond.nl |accessdate=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion the Dutch law does not reflect current reality on this issue.
* The foundation ''Centrum Individu en Samenleving'' (CISA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cisasite.nl/.|title=Cisa|work=cisasite.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  sees the increasing number of persons living in different social arrangements than marriage as a reason to break the unilateral focus on marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' L. de Zwaan &amp; K. van der Leer, ''De sociale familie: de maatschappelijke emancipatie van alleenstaanden'', Den Haag: CISA 2013, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Yearbook of International Law''', founded in 1948 by Rudolf Laun and Hermann von Mangoldt as the Jahrbuch für Internationales Recht, is Germany's oldest yearbook in the field of [[public international law]]. The GYIL is published annually by the [[Walther Schücking Institute of International Law]] at the [[University of Kiel]] and the publisher [[Duncker &amp; Humblot]].

The GYIL provides a forum for scholars in international law – both inside and outside Germany – to publish new research on and analysis of current issues in international law. The journal features a ‘Forum' for which a prominent scholar of international law is invited to write a stand-alone article and a ‘Focus' section for which a group of experts are invited to write articles examining various aspects of a topic set in advance by the editors. Recent Focus sections have examined [[climate change]] (2010), [[regional human rights mechanisms]] (2009), [[poverty]] as a challenge to international law (2008) and German approaches to international law (2007). The 2011 Focus section will examine the Arctic.

Beginning with Vol. 53 (2010), the ‘General Articles' section of the GYIL will be open to submissions from the entire academic community and will be independently [[peer-reviewed]] by a community of experts. Manuscripts for the ‘General Articles' section may examine a broad range of topics in international law and should be submitted to the editors by 1 September 2011 for consideration for the 2011 volume.

Beginning with Vol. 52 (2009), the section ‘German Practice' has appeared, providing reports on German state practice [[Sources of international law#State practice]] with relevance for the development of international law. The ‘Book Reviews' section presents reviews of recently published works in international law and, in particular, seeks to increase international interest in German and German-language publications by publishing book reviews and review essays in English.

The GYIL publishes in English in order to reach the largest possible readership.

The Walther Schücking Institute of International Law at the [[University of Kiel]] was founded in 1914 and is the oldest university institute for public international law in Germany.

'''Hul Jharkhand Party''', a [[political party]] in [[India]]. Founded by Justin Richard on December 28, 1968, after the fragmentation of the [[Jharkhand Party]]. The party worked amongst the [[Santhal people|Santhal]] populations. It demanded a separate tribal-majority state and social reform. A splinter group, the [[Bihar Progressive Hul Jharkhand Party]] was later founded by [[Sibu Soren]].

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Illegal ''per se''}}
In [[US law]], the term '''illegal ''per se''''' means that the act is inherently illegal. Thus, an act is illegal without extrinsic proof of any surrounding circumstances such as lack of ''[[scienter]]'' (knowledge) or other defenses. Acts are made illegal ''per se'' by [[statute]], [[constitution]] or [[case law]].

==Drunk driving==
Many [[drunk driving]] laws make driving with a [[blood alcohol content]] over a certain limit (such as 0.05% or 0.08%) an act which is illegal ''per se''.

==Antitrust==
In the [[United States]], illegal ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]'' often refers to categories of [[Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive behavior]] in [[antitrust]] [[law]] conclusively presumed to be an "unreasonable restraint on trade" and thus anti competitive.  The [[United States Supreme Court]] has, in the past, determined activities such as [[price fixing]], geographic [[market division]], and [[group boycott]] to be illegal ''per se'' regardless of the reasonableness of such actions. Traditionally, illegal ''per se'' anti-trust acts describe [[horizontal market]] arrangements among [[Competition (economics)|competitor]]s.

The illegal ''per se'' category can trace its origins in the 1898 Supreme Court case ''[[Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. U.S.]]'', [[Case citation|175 U.S. 211]] (1898).

A number of cases have subsequently raised doubts about the validity of the illegal ''per se'' rule.  Under modern Antitrust theories, the traditionally illegal ''per se'' categories create more of a [[presumption]] of unreasonableness.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[[Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.]]'', 441 U.S. 1 (1979); ''[[Nat's Collegiate Athletic Assn v. Board of Regents]]'', 468 U.S. 85, 98 (1984); ''[[Northwest Wholesale Stationers, Inc. v. Pacific Stationery &amp; Printing Co.]]'', 472 U.S. 284, 289 (1985); and ''[[FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists]]'', 476 U.S. 447 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court carefully narrowed the ''per se'' treatment and began issuing guidelines.  Courts and agencies seeking to apply the ''per se'' rule must:
# show "the practice facially appears to be one that would always or almost always tend to restrict competition and decrease output";
# show that the practice is not "one designed to 'increase economic efficiency and render markets more, rather than less, competitive'";
# carefully examine market conditions; and
# absent good evidence of competitiveness behavior, avoid broadening ''per se'' treatment to new or innovative business relationships.

The '''Indian Register''' is the official record of ''Status [[First Nations|Indians]]'' or ''Registered Indians'' in [[Canada]]. Status Indians have rights and benefits that are not granted to [[Non-Status Indian|unregistered]] Indians, [[Inuit]], or [[Métis in Canada|Métis]], the chief benefits of which include the granting of [[Indian reserve|reserves]] and of rights associated with them, an extended [[hunting season]], a less restricted [[right to keep and bear arms|right to bear arms]], an exemption from federal and provincial taxes, and more freedom in the management of gaming and tobacco franchises via less government interference and taxes.

==History==
In 1851 the colonial governments of [[British North America]] began to keep records of Indians and bands entitled to benefits under [[treaty]]. For 100 years, individual [[Indian agents]] made lists of members who belonged to each band. In 1951, the current Indian Register was established by amendment of the [[Indian Act (Canada)|Indian Act]], and the many band lists were combined into one.

In 1985, the Indian Act was amended again with the goal of restoring Indian status to people who had lost it through discriminatory provisions of the Act, and to their children. Over 100,000 people who had lost their status in this way have since been added to the Register.

==Indian status==
The list is maintained by [[Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada]]. Sole authority for determining who will be registered is vested in the post of Registrar.

===Revocation of status===
The discriminatory reasons for revoking status were:

* marrying a man who was not a Status Indian
* [[enfranchisement]] (until 1960, an Indian [[Universal suffrage|could vote]] in federal elections only by renouncing Indian status)
* having a mother and paternal grandmother who did not have status before marriage (these people lost status at 21)
* being born out of wedlock of a mother with status and a father without.

===Documentary proof of Indian status===
Since 1956 the Canadian federal government has issued an identity document to individuals who have status under the Indian Act.&lt;ref name=AANDC-FAQ-SCIS&gt;Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, [http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100032383/1100100032385 Frequently Asked Questions - Secure Certificate of Indian Status], 2012-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally these documents have been used by Aboriginals to cross the border between Canada and the United States.&lt;ref name=AANDC-FAQ-SCIS/&gt;

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Iran]] on 28 July 1989, alongside [[Iranian presidential election, 1989|presidential elections]]. Approved by 97.6% of voters,&lt;ref name="OUP"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Dieter|last1=Nohlen|author-link1=Dieter Nohlen||first2=Florian|last2=Grotz|first3=Christof |last3=Hartmann |year=2001|title=Elections in Asia: A Data Handbook|chapter=Iran|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=I|page=72|isbn=0-19-924958-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first and so far only time the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] has been amended. It made several changes to articles 5, 107, 109, 111, and added article 176. It eliminated the need for the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] (''rahbar'') of the country to be a ''[[Marja'|marja]]'' or chosen by popular acclaim,&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', (2001), p.293&lt;/ref&gt; it eliminated the post of [[Prime Minister of Iran|prime minister]], and it created a [[Supreme National Security Council]].

==Background==
On 24 April 1989 while on his deathbed, [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] appointed a 25-man "Council for the Revision of the Constitution" ({{lang-fa|شورای بازنگری قانون اساسی|Šurā-ye bāznegari-e qānun-e asāsi}}). The council named [[Ali Khamenei]] as Khomeini's successor as [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] and drew up several amendments to the original [[constitution]]. Since the senior [[mujtahid]] or [[Marja'|Marja]] of Iran had given only lukewarm support to Khomeini's principle of [[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|rule by Islamic jurist]], and Khamenei was not a marja, the original prerequisite that the [[rahbar]] (leader) be "a paramount [[faqih]]" (i.e. one of these marja) was dropped from the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, ''History of Modern Iran'', (2008), p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Some changes to the constitution introduced by the Reform Council include:
*changing the name of the Majlis-e Melli to the [[Majlis]]-e Islami.
*increasing the size of the [[Assembly of Experts]] to 86 members
*giving the Assembly of Experts the authority to convene at least once a year and to determine whether the Supreme Leader was ‘mentally and physically capable of carrying out his arduous duties.’
*transforming the [[Expediency Council]] into a permanent body with members appointed by the Supreme Leader as well as representatives from the three branches of government, the armed forces, the intelligence service, and the Guardian Council.

The amendments were approved by Iranian voters and became law on 28 July 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://servat.unibe.ch/icl/ir00000_.html Iran - Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Allotment is simply the creation of shares and their transfer to a subscriber. After allotment, a subscriber becomes a shareholder, though usually that also requires formal entry in the [[share registry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41497076|title=Schaum's outline of theory and problems of financial accounting|last=K.|first=Shim, Jae|date=1999|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Siegel, Joel G.|year=|isbn=0071341668|edition= 2nd|location=New York|pages=233|oclc=41497076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issued shares are those shares which the [[board of directors]] and/or shareholders have agreed to allocate. Issued shares are the sum of [[outstanding shares]] held by shareholders; and [[treasury shares]] are shares which had been issued but have been repurchased by the corporation, and which generally have no voting rights or rights to dividends.

The issued shares of a corporation form the [[Equity (finance)|equity capital]] of the corporation, and some corporations are required by law to have a minimum value of equity capital, while others may not need any or just a nominal number. The value of the issued shares are determined at the time they are issued and the value does not change, in relation to the issuing corporation after that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/equity%20capital|title=Definition of EQUITY CAPITAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shares are most commonly issued fully paid, in which case the liability of the shareholders is limited to the amount paid on the shares; but they may also be issued [[partly paid]], with unlimited liability, subject to guarantee, or some other form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beleggen.info/aandelen/|title=Beleggen in aandelen|last=Lisam|first=Heinrickh|date=|website=beleggen.info|language=nl-nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Law Commission of India''' is an [[Executive(government)|executive body]] established by an order of the [[Government of India]]. Its major function is to work for [[law reform|legal reform]]. Its membership primarily comprises legal experts, who are entrusted a mandate by the Government. The Commission is established for a fixed tenure and works as an advisory body to the [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]]

The first Law Commission was established during the [[British East India Company|British Raj era]] in 1834 by the ''Charter Act of 1833''. After that, three more Commissions were established in pre-independent India. The first Law Commission of independent India was established in 1955 for a three-year term. Since then, twenty more Commissions have been established. The 20th Law Commission was established in 2013 under the Chairmanship of Supreme Court Judge, D.K Jain. Its tenure was fixed till 2015. The present Law Commission was established in 2015, and has tenure to 2018. The terms of reference of the Law Commission include the review and repeal of obsolete laws, the examination of existing laws &amp; the revision of central Acts of general importance. In November 2013, the Centre appointed former Chief Justice of [[Delhi High Court]] Justice [[Ajit Prakash Shah]] as the New chairman of the 20th Law Commission of India in place of D.K Jain who has taken over as president [[National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission]], Shah has a three-year tenure and has been saddled with a wide terms of reference including one to examine existing laws from the gender equality perspective and suggest necessary amendments.

Justice Balbir Singh Chauhan, a former judge of the Supreme Court was appointed Chairman of the 21st Law Commission on 10 March. This post was lying vacant since September 2015. 66-year old Justice Chauhan is currently heading the Cauvery River Water Disputes Tribunal. One of the key issues pending before the Law Commission is a call on amending the Indian Penal Code (IPC) amid allegations of abuse and arbitrary use of the law.

==Evolution of Law Commission in India==
{{Politics of India}}

The origin of the first Law Commission of India lies in the diverse and often conflicting laws prevailing in the local regions and those administered by the [[Honourable East India Company|East India Company]], which was granted [[Royal Charter]]s and also conferred powers by the various Indian rulers to administer and oversee the conduct of the inhabitants in the local areas where the Company exercised control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Jain, M.P. | authorlink=  | title=Outlines of Indian Legal History | year=1984 | publisher=N.M. Tripathi | location= Bombay |  pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of administration by the Company, two sets of laws operated in the areas; one which applied to and in relation to British citizens and the second which applied to the local inhabitants and aliens. This was considered as a major stumbling block for proper administration by the British Government during the times which is now known as the [[British Raj]]. In order to improve the law and order situation and also to ensure uniformity of legal administration, various options were looked for. Until then the British Government had been passing various [[enactment (British legal term)|enactments]] to deal with particular situations, such as the Prohibition of [[Sati (practice)|Sati]] in (1829) by [[Lord William Bentinck]] under the influence of [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]]. However it was for the first time in (1833) that the idea to establish a Law Commission for a comprehensive examination of the existing legal system prevailing in the British administered areas and its overhaul was instituted.

==Pre-Independence Law Commissions of India==
The First Law Commission was established in 1834 by the British Government under the Chairmanship of [[Lord Macaulay]].&lt;ref name="early"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/main.htm#EARLY_BEGINNINGS: |title=Early beginnings |publisher=lawcommissionofindia.nic.in |accessdate=2008-06-05 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It suggested various enactments to the British Government, most of which were passed and enacted and are still in force in India. Few of the most important recommendations made by this First Law Commission were those on, ''[[Indian Penal Code]]'' (first submitted in 1837 but enacted in 1860 and still in force), ''Criminal Procedure Code'' (enacted in 1898, repealed and succeeded by the ''Criminal Procedure Code of 1973''),  etc. Thereafter three more Law Commissions were established which made a number of other recommendations the ''[[Indian Evidence Act]]'' (1872) and ''Indian Contract Act'' (1872), etc. being some of the significant ones. The contribution of these Law Commissions can be enumerated as under;

==Law Commissions in Independent India==
The tradition of pursuing [[law reform]] through the medium of a [[Law Commission]] was continued in post-independent India. The first law commission in Independent India was established in 1955 and since then twenty more law commissions have been established. Each of these Commissions have been chaired by a prominent legal personality in India and has made a significant contribution to the legal diaspora of India. The contribution of each of these Commissions has been enumerated below.

===First Law Commission===
The first Law Commission of independent India was established in 1955. The Chairman of this Commission was Mr. [[M. C. Setalvad]], who was also the First [[Attorney General of India]]. The term of this Commission was established as three years (which by convention has been followed till date) and this Commission submitted its last report on 16 September 1958. The reports submitted by the First Law Commission of India are as under;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/main.htm#REPORTS_SUBMITTED_BY_FIRST_LAW_COMMISSIO |title= First Law Commission |publisher=lawcommissionofindia.nic.in |accessdate=2008-06-05 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key issues pending before the law panel is a call on amending the Indian Penal Code amid allegations of abuse and arbitrary use of the law. The Law Ministry had urged the Commission to study the usage of the provisions of Section 124A (Sedition) of the IPC.

Former Supreme Court judge Balbir Singh Chauhan was appointed Chairman of the 21st Law Commission. Mr. Justice Ravi R. Tripathi, retired judge of the Gujarat High Court was appointed as Full-time Member.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawmin.nic.in/la/MemberLCI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working of the Law Commission==
The Law Commission works in close co-ordination and under the general instruction of [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]]. It generally acts as the initiation point for law reform in the country. Internally, the Law Commission works in a research-oriented manner. Employing a number of research analysts (and even law students from 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/internship.htm |title= Student Internships at Law Commission
|publisher=lawcommissionofindia.nic.in |accessdate=2008-06-05 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt;), the Commission works upon the assigned agenda and primarily comes up with research based reports, often conclusive and recommendatory. The permanent members of the Commission generally are responsible for framing the exact topic and reference to work upon and often takes the services of eminent law experts and jurists who are familiar with the matter under review. These experts may either work part-time with the Commission or may have been requested to contribute to specific reports or issues under review.

According to the Commission's website, the Commission's regular staff consists of about a dozen research personnel of different ranks and varied experiences with a small group of secretarial staff looks after the administration side of the Commission's operations&lt;ref name = "working"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/main.htm#HOW_DOES_THE_COMMISSION_FUNCTION?| title= How does the Commission function? |publisher=lawcommissionofindia.nic.in| accessdate=2008-06-12 |last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the internal functioning of the Commission can be described as a process with the following stages;
* Initiation of projects at the Commission's meetings;
* Discussion of priorities; identification of topics and assignment of preparatory work to Members;
* Adoption of methodologies for collection of data and research;
* Outlining of problems and determination of areas for reform;
* Consultations with public, professional bodies and academic institutions;
* Evaluation of responses and preparation of draft of report;
* Discussion and scrutiny of report, leading to its finalization; and
* Forwarding of report to the Ministry of Law and Justice.&lt;ref name = "working"/&gt;

Once the Report is submitted to the [[Ministry of Law and Justice (India)|Ministry of Law and Justice]], the task of the Commission ends unless it is required to rework upon identified areas of provide clarifications by the Government on the report submitted. Upon receipt of the Report, it is the responsible for follow-up action on the recommendations made by the Commission in the Report. Generally the Ministry of Law and Justice forwards the Report with its remarks to other relevant Ministries in the Government of India and seeks from them their opinion on the relevance of the recommendation and finalizes with them the manner of implemendation of these recommendations. When the proposals are cleared by the various Ministries and approved by the [[Indian Cabinet Ministers#Cabinet Ministers|Cabinet]], the Ministry of Law and Justice goes for drafting of the implementing legislation or follows the draft submitted by the Law Commission (which usually is the case) and presents the same for approval before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]].

==Role of Law Commission in legal reform in India==
The Law Commission of India, though an ad hoc body, has been key to law reform in India.&lt;ref name="PIB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/fe1199/f2911991.html | title= Rarely seen or heard, Law Commission's work has a great impact | publisher= Press Information Bureau (India) | author=Lalit Sethi | accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its role has been both advisory and critical of the government's policies.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The [[Supreme Court of India]] and [[academia]] have recognized the commission as pioneering and prospective.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In a number of decisions, the Supreme Court has referred to the work done by the commission and followed its recommendations.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The fact that the chairman of the commission is generally a retired judge of the Supreme Court has helped the prominence of the commission.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}{{quote|The Commission reviews judicial administration to ensure that it is responsive so that delays are eliminated, arrears are cleared and disposal of cases is quick and cost-effective without sacrificing the cardinal principle that they are just and fair. The Commission seeks to simplify procedure to curb delays and improve standards of justice. It also strives to promote an accountable and citizen-friendly government which is transparent and ensures the people's right to information.&lt;ref name="PIB"/&gt;}}

The recommendations of the commission are not binding on the government. "They are recommendations. They may be accepted or rejected. Action on the said recommendations depends on the ministries/departments, which are concerned with the subject matter of the recommendations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/jun/23rti.htm | title= Crores spent, yet obsolete laws live | publisher=Rediff India Abroad | date=23 June 2008 | accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in a number of important and critical recommendations not being implemented. The commission, however, has continued to work upon its assigned tasks.

The power vested in the commission to ''suo motu'' take up matters for discussion and submit recommendations has also worked well to the advantage of India's legal system.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The history of the commission is replete with such recommendations which have been made in the wake of the hour and where the law has needed change.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Further, the commission has been often returned to review its earlier reports in the wake of changed scenarios and the aptness of law in such situations.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} [[Euthanasia]] and related issues, in particular, has been one such area where the commission has been relook the situation at least three times, with the latest being its 196th report on the topic.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Besides the Law Ministry, the commission has also been requested to work upon specific issues and submit its views by the Supreme Court on various occasions. The latest in regard has been the 205th report of the commission which has been prepared in view of the Supreme Court's request for assistance in determination of "certain legal issues relating to child marriage, and the different ages at which a person is defined as a child in different laws." The report stirred a public debate in India for recommending ''inter alia'', a reduction in marriage age of boys to be at par with girls at 18, instead of the long continuing 21 and 18 respectively.

With all its past and present works being continuously provided on the internet, the commission has also provided a firm assistance to legal research in the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The fact that a number of its reports have been taken receptively by the various ministries and have been worked upon to change the legal scenario, is itself an indicator sufficient enough of the role of the commission in furtherance of law reform in India.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The '''Legal Tools''' are the leading online [[database]] on [[international criminal law]]. The database provides legal practitioners and researchers with [[open access]] information on the core crimes of international law ([[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]] and the [[crime of aggression]]). Being a tool of [[computer-assisted legal research]], the database provides access to all relevant [[case law]] and legislation ([[statute]]s, preparatory works, key [[treaty|treaties]]) from both international and national jurisdictions as well as academic writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-tools.org/what-are-the-icc-legal-tools/ What are the ICC Legal Tools?]&lt;/ref&gt; All resources are stored under [[persistent uniform resource locator|persistent URLs]].

The ''Legal Tools Project'' (''LTP'') is associated with the [[International Criminal Court]]. It currently has partners from fourteen countries on all continents. The content of the database is mainly provided by academic institutions and [[non-governmental organization]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-tools.org/what-are-the-icc-legal-tools/ What are the ICC Legal Tools?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Criminal Court links in its publicised decisions to the database. As an example, the judgement of the trial chamber in the case of [[Germain Katanga]] included 538 [[hyperlink]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-tools.org/doc/f74b4f/ ICC, Judgement of 7. March 2014 (Katanga, TC)], PDF-File, 6,7MB).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}
'''Legal cost finance''' (or '''legal cost credit''') is an alternative funding solution to traditional [[legal financing]] (or [[litigation funding]] in United Kingdom).

Unlike litigation funding, which is limited to contentious legal cases and claims a stake in the proceeds of a case outcome, legal cost finance is a funding alternative that offers consumers payment plans (on the basis of credit facilities) to cover legal costs of both contentious and non-contentious matters.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Thursday, 24 October 2013. Issue Number 71024: page 63&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, legal cost finance is a specialised financing solution that spreads the cost of legal services over an extended period and enables consumers to repay their legal bills via instalments.

For lawyers, legal cost finance provides the assurance of on-time bill payment and minimisation of disputes over legal costs.  A third-party arranger (specialised broker) installs the payment plan facility and settles legal costs on the client's behalf using the credit funds (usually held in [[escrow]] accounts).  If a dispute over a legal bill arises, the broker can 'quarantine' the dispute to prevent stalling of the legal matter.  That is, the disputed bill is placed in abeyance until a later date (usually after completion of the legal case) whilst the lawyer continues to be paid from the credit facility.  The disputed bill is later revisited in the context of the case outcome – normally the client will forfeit the dispute in the event of a successful case result, and vice versa (i.e. the lawyer will forfeit the dispute in the event of an unsuccessful case outcome).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawandmore.co.uk/legal-news/financing-solution-launched-to-assist-consumers-and-lawyers/ |title=Law and Legal Legal News – Financing Solution Launched to Assist Consumers and Lawyers -for legal professionals |publisher=Lawandmore.co.uk |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal cost finance can function as a cost-neutral credit facility.  That is, the charges associated with legal cost finance (arrangement fees and interest) can be absorbed by the lawyer (directly or by discounts on legal fees), enabling the client to effectively pay legal bills without incurring additional costs.  Lawyers are usually forthcoming about covering client's charges associated with legal cost finance on the client's behalf in exchange for the payment assurances they receive from the broker over their bills.

For consumers of legal services, legal cost finance is an alternative to the payment of significant up-front costs to lawyers on the basis of a [[retainer agreement]].  Effectively, therefore, LCF makes legal services more affordable.

Consumers can apply for LCF solely on the basis of their [[credit history]] because the specialised loans are provided on an [[Unsecured loan|unsecured basis]].  However, in certain large legal matters security over loans will be required.

LCF primarily relies on a report from the acting lawyer stating the merits of the case, which is assessed by the broker.  This is designed to protect consumers from potentially irresponsible advice and to prevent the court system from cluttering by unmeritorious cases.

LCF was first launched in the United Kingdom by an independent [[law broker]], Dr Yuri Rapoport&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legalcostfinance.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solicitorsjournal.com/news/legal-profession/legal-services/first-legal-services-credit-finance-brokerage-launched |title=First legal services credit finance brokerage launched |publisher=Solicitorsjournal.com |date=26 November 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4686">This is a '''list of treaties of the Confederate States of America'''.

The [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA) was not officially recognized as a sovereign state by any foreign nation. Thus, the CSA did not enter into any bilateral or [[multilateral treaty|multilateral]] [[treaty|treaties]] with other states.

However, in 1861, the CSA authorized [[Albert Pike]]—the CSA "Commissioner to all the Indian Tribes West of Arkansas and South of Kansas"—to negotiate and conclude treaties with [[Native Americans in the United States|native Indian]] tribes resident in [[Indian Territory]]. Pike concluded nine treaties with Indian tribes between July and October 1861. Each of the nine treaties were ratified by the [[Congress of the Confederate States|CSA Congress]] prior to the end of the year.

{{confuse|Command (military formation)}}
A '''military command''' or '''order''' is a binding instruction given by a senior rank to a junior rank in a military context. Not all senior ranks in all military have the right to give an order to all lower ranks.&lt;ref&gt;[[George B. Davis|George Breckenridge Davis]], ''A Treatise on the Military Law of the United States,'' 1913 1584776501 p385 "A staff officer has, except by assignment, no right to give a military order to an officer of the line ; if he should do so without stating that he did so in the name of a superior to the line officer, such order would be invalid."&lt;/ref&gt; A [[general order]] is a published directive by an officer in a command post, which is binding on all ranks under his command, and intended to enforce a policy or procedure.

==US Military==
In the US military an [[operations order]] is a plan format meant which is intended to assist subordinate units with the conduct of military operations.

'''''Monroe v Hopkins'''''&lt;ref&gt;[2017] EWHC 433 (QB) (10 March 2017), [2017] EMLR 16, [2017] 4 WLR 68, [2017] WLR(D) 188&lt;/ref&gt; was a 2017 [[libel]] case in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court of England and Wales]]. It was brought by the food writer and activist [[Jack Monroe]] against the columnist [[Katie Hopkins]] after Hopkins falsely alleged that Monroe supported vandalism of a war memorial. Hopkins was ordered to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in damage and legal fees.

== Background ==
[[File:UK-2014-London-Monument to the Women of World War II (1).jpg|thumb|Monument to the Women of World War II]]
During an anti-[[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] protest in 2015, protesters spraypainted "fuck Tory scum" on the [[Monument to the Women of World War II]] in [[Whitehall]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11595097/Police-officer-injured-as-anti-Tory-protesters-gather-outside-Downing-Street-and-Whitehall.html|title=Anti-Tory protesters deface war monument on Whitehall|date=10 May 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the social media site [[Twitter]], the political writer [[Laurie Penny]] said she had no problem with the vandalism. [[Katie Hopkins]], a rightwing columnist,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/16/katie-hopkins-applies-for-insolvency-to-avoid-bankruptcy-after-jack-monroe-twitter-costly-libel-case|title=Katie Hopkins applies for insolvency agreement to avoid bankruptcy|last=Waterson|first=Jim|date=16 September 2018|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; reacted negatively, suggesting that Penny be sent to join [[ISIS|Islamic State]]. Both writers' comments received national media coverage.&lt;ref name="judgment"&gt;[https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/judgments/judgment-monroe-v-hopkins/ Judgment: Monroe -v- Hopkins], HM Courts and Tribunal Service 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 18 May, a few days later, Hopkins tweeted to the food writer [[Jack Monroe]]: "Scrawled on any war memorials recently?" Monroe responded that they had never vandalised a war memorial and had family members in the armed forces. Hopkins responded in a tweet asking someone to explain the difference between Penny (an "irritant") and Monroe ("social anthrax").&lt;ref name="judgment" /&gt;

Monroe asked for a retraction via Twitter and was blocked by Hopkins. Monroe asked Hopkins to make a public apology and give £5,000 to "migrant rescue" as a settlement to prevent the matter going to court.&lt;ref name="judgment" /&gt;

== Decision ==

The decision by [[Mark Warby|Mr Justice Warby]], given on 10 March 2017, discusses the difficulty of applying English libel law to new media platforms like Twitter, and contains an extended discussion on how Twitter functions. It determined that the two tweets sent by Hopkins were [[Defamation|defamatory]] to Monroe (according to the [[Defamation Act 2013]]) and were the source of "serious harm", a prerequisite for demonstrating libel. The court assessed the damage to Monroe at £24,000—£16,000 for the first tweet, and £8,000 for the second.&lt;ref name="judgment" /&gt; Hopkins was also ordered to pay costs,&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/10/jack-monroe-wins-twitter-libel-case-against-katie-hopkins|title=Jack Monroe wins Twitter libel case against Katie Hopkins|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|date=10 March 2017|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimated at over £300,000.&lt;ref name="Guardian15/3/2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/mar/15/jack-monroe-bears-no-ill-will-towards-katie-hopkins-libel-case|title=Jack Monroe bears 'no ill will' towards Katie Hopkins after libel case|last=Addley|first=Esther|date=15 March 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

Some days after the decision, Hopkins, who did not appear in court, stated that she was "very likely" to appeal against the ruling, on the grounds that no evidence of harm had been produced in the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/15/katie-hopkins-jack-monroe-libel-ruling-bbc-mailonline|title=Katie Hopkins 'very likely' to challenge Jack Monroe libel ruling|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 March 2017|first=Matthew|last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two and a half weeks after the judgment Hopkins was told she could not appeal; Warby said Hopkins' appeal would not have "a real prospect of success" in his view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Katie Hopkins cannot appeal Jack Monroe libel tweet case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-39437724|accessdate=3 April 2017|work=BBC News|date=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after the verdict, Monroe said they bore "no ill will" towards Hopkins: "Although what she said about me was wrong and the last two years have been a grim process, I would happily sit down and talk as adults. I just think the world is a bit better when you are willing to give people chances."&lt;ref name="Guardian15/3/2017" /&gt; Monroe said they hope the case will set a precedent and improve Twitter.&lt;ref name="Guardian15/3/2017" /&gt;

Hopkins sold her Exeter home in March 2018 to pay the debts arising from the case.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oppenheim |first1=Maya |title=Fundraising page set up to buy Katie Hopkins' house and give it to asylum seekers |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/katie-hopkins-house-exeter-st-leonards-a8171051.html |accessdate=5 July 2018 |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterworth"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Butterworth |first1=Benjamin |title=Katie Hopkins sells £1m home after losing lawsuit to Jack Monroe |url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/01/22/katie-hopkins-sells-1m-home-after-losing-lawsuit-to-jack-monroe/ |accessdate=5 July 2018 |work=PinkNews |date=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Penberthy-Hutchins|first=Tina|url=https://www.devonlive.com/news/property/katie-hopkins-luxury-devon-home-1526502|title=Katie Hopkin's luxury Devon home was one of the most expensive sold this year|work=Devon Live|date=2 May 2018|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She applied for an [[individual voluntary arrangement]] in May 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Monroe said of the news: "My offer of a cup of tea still stands if she wants to talk about it ... Lots of people are celebrating but I’m not. It's a sad, lonely sort of anticlimax. It’s really crap and I feel really bad it’s all ended up like this.

'''''NCAA March Madness''''' is the branding used for coverage of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] that is jointly produced by [[CBS Sports]], the sports division of the [[CBS]] television network, and [[Turner Sports]], the sports division of the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] in the United States. Through the agreement between CBS and Turner, which began with the [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2011 tournament]], games are televised on [[CBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]], [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] and [[truTV]]. [[CBS Sports Network]] has re-aired games from all networks.

Initially, CBS continued to provide coverage during most rounds, with the three Turner channels covering much of the early rounds up to the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship#Regional semifinals and finals|Sweet Sixteen]]. Starting in 2016, the regional finals, Final Four and national championship game began to alternate between CBS and TBS.&lt;ref name="CBSTurnerNCAA"&gt;{{cite press release|title=CBS Sports, Turner Broadcasting, NCAA Reach 14-Year Agreement|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/2010-04-21/cbs-sports-turner-broadcasting-ncaa-reach-14-year-agreement|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|website=NCAA.com|date=April 21, 2010|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|last=Gorman|first=Bill|title=NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament Expands To 68 Teams; CBS Adds Turner To Television Team|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/22/ncaa-mens-basketball-tournament-expands-to-68-teams-cbs-adds-turner-to-television-team/49412|work=CBS|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] ([[Zap2It]]/[[Tribune Media]])|date=April 22, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501012528/http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/22/ncaa-mens-basketball-tournament-expands-to-68-teams-cbs-adds-turner-to-television-team/49412|archivedate=May 1, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBS holds the rights to the final two rounds in even numbered years, with CBS getting the games in odd numbered years.&lt;ref name="CBSTurnerNCAA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flint|first=Joe|title=CBS cuts in Turner on NCAA basketball tournament|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-turner-20100423,0,695439.story|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 23, 2010|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This joint tournament coverage should be distinguished from CBS's [[College Basketball on CBS|regular-season coverage]], which it produces independently through its sports division. Turner does not currently cover regular-season college basketball games. Games broadcast on all four networks use a variation of the longtime ''CBS College Basketball'' theme music.

==Background and coverage breakdown==
[[File:Ncaa mm hdr.jpg|thumb|Logo used until 2018.]]
On April 22, 2010, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) reached a 14-year agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fang|first=Ken|title=Looking back at how the NCAA-CBS/Turner partnership began|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/cbs/looking-back-ncaa-cbsturner-partnership-began.html|website=AwfulAnnouncing.com|date=March 17, 2017|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; worth [[United States dollar|US$]]10.8 billion, with CBS and the Turner Broadcasting System to receive joint broadcast rights to the Division I men's college basketball tournament.&lt;ref name="CBSTurnerNCAA" /&gt; This came after speculation that [[ESPN]] would try to obtain the rights to future tournament games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Surber|first=Don|title=ESPN to snag the Final Four?|url=https://archive.li/t4zpz|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=March 29, 2010|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA took advantage of an opt-out clause in its 1999 deal with CBS (which ran through 2013, even though the NCAA had the option of ending the agreement after the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010 championship]]) to announce its intention to sign a new contract with CBS and [[Turner Sports]], a division of [[Time Warner]] (which, incidentally, jointly owns [[The CW]] with the CBS television network's corporate parent [[CBS Corporation]]). The new contract came amid serious consideration by the NCAA of expanding the tournament to 68 teams.

The agreement, which runs through 2032 (extended from 2024 in 2016),&lt;ref name="wp-2032extend"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bonesteel|first=Matt|title=CBS and Turner Sports lock down NCAA tournament through 2032|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/04/12/cbs-and-turner-sports-lock-down-ncaa-tournament-through-2032/|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates that all games are available nationally. All First Four games air on [[truTV]]. During the first and second rounds, a featured game in each time "window" is broadcast terrestrially on CBS, while all other games are shown on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]], [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] or TruTV. Sweet 16 (regional semifinal) and Elite 8 (regional finals) games are split among CBS and TBS. In 2014 and 2015, Turner channels had exclusive rights to the Final Four (with standard coverage airing on TBS), and CBS broadcast the championship game. Since 2016, rights to the Final Four and championship game alternate between Turner and CBS; the 2016 tournament marked the first time that the national championship game was not broadcast on over-the-air television.&lt;ref name=adweek-tbsfinalfour&gt;{{cite news|last=Crupi|first=Anthony|title=Fast Break: TBS to Air Final Four in 2014: College hoops title game shifts to cable in 3 years|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/fast-break-tbs-air-final-four-2014-149228|work=[[Adweek]]|date=May 7, 2013|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same number of "windows" are provided to CBS as before, although unlike with the previous schedule where all games in a window started within 10 minutes of each other, resulting in the possibility of multiple close games ending at once, the start times of games are staggered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NCAA tournament changing schedule to air more games in full|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=6107744|publisher=ESPN|date=February 10, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with action lasting later in the night and fewer simultaneous games than in the previous format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS Sports, Turner Sports Unveil TV Schedule For 2011 March Madness Tournament|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cbs-sports-turner-sports-unveil-tv-schedule-for-2011-march-madness-tournament_b87074|work=[[AdWeek|TVNewser]]|publisher=[[Mediabistro.com|Mediabistro, Inc.]]|date=February 10, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the new deal, [[Mega March Madness]], a [[pay-per-view]] [[out-of-market sports package]] covering games in the tournament, was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turner Networks To Air 41 March Madness Tournament Games|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/463763-Turner_Networks_To_Air_41_March_Madness_Tournament_Games.php|work=Multichannel News|date=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''March Madness On Demand'' (now called ''March Madness Live'') remained unchanged, with Turner Interactive taking over management of both that service and NCAA.com at the start of 2011. The contract was expected to be signed after a review by the NCAA Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBS, Turner win TV rights to tourney|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=5125307|work=ESPN|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the service was changed; only games televised by CBS are available for free. All other games are available to [[TV Everywhere|authenticated subscribers to the channels on participating television providers]]. The 2018 tournament, with TBS televising the national semifinals and final, is the first in which those particular games are subject to authentication restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/mobile/turners-expanded-tv-everywhere-presence-should-boost-delivery-ncaa-march-madness-live/142248 |title=Turner's Expanded TV Everywhere Presence Should Boost Delivery of NCAA March Madness Live|publisher=Multichannel News|date=March 16, 2013|accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-nevermiss&gt;{{cite web|title=You’ll Never Miss That Game Again|url=http://www.multichannel.com/internet-video/you%E2%80%99ll-never-miss-game-again/131557|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBS-Turner coverage formally begins with ''The Selection Show''—in which the teams participating in the tournament are announced, which follows CBS's coverage of the final game on [[Selection Sunday]]. During the tournament itself, truTV broadcasts pre-game coverage, ''Infiniti NCAA Tip-Off'', while TBS and TruTV also air the post-game show ''Inside March Madness''. CBS also produces coverage of the [[Reese's College All-Star Game]] (held on the afternoon of the Final Four at its venue), and the [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship|Division II championship game]], which are both aired as part of the ''March Madness'' package.

In 2016, CBS extended the selection show to a two-hour format; however, the new special was criticized by viewers for being too padded, while the full bracket was [[Internet leak|leaked]] shortly into the broadcast.&lt;ref name="wp-ssratings"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boren|first=Cindy|title=Ratings for CBS's NCAA tournament selection show were almost as bad as show itself|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2016/03/14/ratings-for-cbss-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-were-almost-as-bad-as-show-itself/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lat-twohour"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schilken|first=Chuck|title=NCAA says it's investigating the bracket leak that saved us from the two-hour Selection Sunday show|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-ncaa-tournament-bracket-leak-20160314-story.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, the selection show was shortened to a 90-minute format. Beginning with 2018, the selection show will return to a two-hour format, but the special aired on TBS instead, marking the first time since 1982 that the official bracket unveiling has not aired on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TBS to Televise 2018 NCAA March Madness Selection Show on Sunday, March 11, at 6 p.m. ET|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/bracketiq/2018-02-07/tbs-televise-2018-ncaa-march-madness-selection-show-sunday|publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association|website=NCAA.com|date=February 7, 2018|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lucia|first=Joe|title=TBS will air this year's NCAA Tournament Selection Show, which is expanding back to two hours|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/ncaa/tbs-will-air-years-ncaa-tournament-selection-show-expanding-back-two-hours.html|website=AwfulAnnouncing.com|date=February 7, 2018|access-date=April 11, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Selection Show will now alternate between TBS and CBS with TBS airing the Selection Show in even numbered years, with CBS airing the Selection Show in odd numbered years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Matt|title=Selection Sunday 2018: Watch the NCAA Selection Show live now|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/selection-sunday-2018-watch-the-ncaa-selection-show-live/|website=[[CNET]]|date=March 11, 2018|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2016, the contract was extended to 2032 in an $8.8 billion deal. The current broadcasting arrangements, including alternating broadcasts of the semi-finals and final, will remain in force.&lt;ref name="wp-2032extend" /&gt;

===Team Streams===
Additionally, for 2014, truTV and TNT aired special "Teamcast" coverage of the Final Four alongside TBS's conventional coverage, which featured commentators and other guests representing the schools in each game.&lt;ref name=sbj-finalfoursimulcast&gt;{{cite news|last=Ourand|first=John|title=Choose your perspective|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2013/11/18/Colleges/Final-Four.aspx|newspaper=[[American City Business Journals|Sports Business Journal]]|date=November 18, 2013|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcn-cbsmoveup&gt;{{cite web|title=March Madness: CBS To Move Up National Championship Tip Time|url=http://www.multichannel.com/content/march-madness-cbs-move-national-championship-tip-time/148810|work=Multichannel News|accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the consortium planned to tap local radio announcers from each team for the teamcasts, the majority refused due to commitments in calling the games for their local radio networks. However, Turner Sports' senior vice president of production, Craig Barry, did expect such difficulties, and planned accordingly with the possibility of using talent from outlets associated with the team, general region, or their conference (such as [[regional sports network|regional networks]]).&lt;ref name=nyt-teamcastcommentators&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Local Voices Aren’t So Eager to Go National|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/sports/ncaabasketball/local-voices-arent-so-eager-to-go-national.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 29, 2014|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbssports-interview&gt;{{cite news|last=Norlander|first=Matt|title=A conversation with vice president of the NCAA tournament, Dan Gavitt|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/24429952/a-conversation-with-vice-president-of-the-ncaa-tournament-dan-gavitt|website=CBSSports.com|publisher=[[CBS Sports]]|date=February 4, 2014|accessdate=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Teamcast feeds returned for the 2015 tournament, now branded as ''Team Stream powered by [[Bleacher Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Final Four Teamcasts Will Return In 2015|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/final-four-teamcasts-will-return-2015.html|publisher=Awful Announcing|date=February 9, 2015|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TNT/truTV Final Four Teamcasts To Be Branded "Team Stream by Bleacher Report" |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/tnttrutv-final-four-teamcasts-to-be-branded-team-stream-presented-by-bleacher-report.html |publisher=Awful Announcing |date=March 26, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For 2016, they were also used on the National Championship game.&lt;ref name="aa-commentators"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS/Turner unveil 2016 NCAA Tournament announcers; Brian Anderson to call Elite Eight|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/cbsturner-unveil-2016-ncaa-tournament-announcers-brian-anderson-to-call-elite-eight.html|website=Awful Announcing|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other college basketball coverage from Turner Sports===
Prior to 2011, Turner Sports' best known association with college basketball perhaps occurred on December 11, 1982, when TBS&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=1982 83 #1 Virginia at #4 Georgetown 1 of 1|id=OJ0ZIBgH5aQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with the aid of more than 100 independent [[network affiliate]]s and [[Independent station (North America)|station]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Battle of giants forms collation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IiJOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ehMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5879,2557299&amp;dq=college+basketball+on+wtbs&amp;hl=en|author=Greg Stoda|newspaper=[[Star-News]]|date=December 10, 1982 |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) broadcast a contest between [[1982–83 Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball team|Virginia]] and [[1982–83 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Superstation Wtbs Fights Network Methods, Programs|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eKwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MAMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6912,4073406&amp;dq=college+basketball+on+wtbs&amp;hl=en|author=Fred Rothenberg|newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=July 22, 1982 |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Awesome Basketball Game Spotlights Sampson-Ewing Confrontation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Bu0cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LH8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2978,6161877&amp;dq=college+basketball+on+wtbs&amp;hl=en|author=Chris Richard|newspaper=[[The Cavalier Daily]]|date=July 22, 1982 |accessdate=June 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=1982-83 UVA vs. Georgetown 12/11|id=RGiTVTaGq90}}&lt;/ref&gt; (led by [[Ralph Sampson]] and [[Patrick Ewing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Biggest Showdown?|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aVcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5191,5729411&amp;dq=college+basketball+on+wtbs&amp;hl=en|author=Peter Meade|newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]|date=December 8, 1982|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively).

Beginning in 2012, TruTV also began to air the preseason [[Coaches vs. Cancer Classic]] as part of a separate deal between Turner Sports and the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turner Sports Snatches The Rights To Coaches vs. Cancer Classic Starting in 2012|url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/09/turner-sports-snatches-the-rights-to-coaches-vs-cancer-classic-starting-in-2012/|author=Ken Fang|work=Fang's Bites|date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=September 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405133527/http://fangsbites.com/2011/09/turner-sports-snatches-the-rights-to-coaches-vs-cancer-classic-starting-in-2012/ |archivedate=April 5, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International coverage===
The same year that the CBS-Turner consortium took over, [[ESPN International]] acquired rights to the tournament for broadcast outside of the United States for networks such as [[The Sports Network|TSN]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/bruce-dowbiggin/tsn-catches-march-madness/article1919949/|title=TSN catches March Madness|author=Bruce Dowbiggin|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=[[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada|date=February 24, 2011|accessdate=March 14, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303090954/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/bruce-dowbiggin/tsn-catches-march-madness/article1919949/ |archivedate=March 3, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ESPN Europe » ESPN America Tipping Off Exclusive Coverage of NCAA® March Madness®|url=http://espnmediazone3.com/wpmu/europe/2011/03/10/espn-america-tipping-off-exclusive-coverage-of-ncaa%C2%AE-march-madness%C2%AE/|author=chappelll|publisher=ESPN MediaZone|date=March 10, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909110333/http://espnmediazone3.com/wpmu/europe/2011/03/10/espn-america-tipping-off-exclusive-coverage-of-ncaa%C2%AE-march-madness%C2%AE/|archivedate=September 9, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most of the coverage is simulcast from the main U.S. feeds, coverage of the Final Four and national championship game uses a separate world feed produced by the ''[[ESPN College Basketball]]'' staff; in [[2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2013]], the Final Four broadcasts on ESPN International were called by ESPN's lead commentators [[Dan Shulman]] and [[Dick Vitale]] (alternatively joined by [[Brad Nessler]] for the second semi-final game).&lt;ref name=usatoday-vitalefinalfour&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick Vitale, finally, to call NCAA Final Four action|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2013/02/05/ncaa-basketball-dick-vitale-final-four-ncaa-basketball/1893125/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==
{{Main|List of NCAA March Madness commentary crews for CBS/Turner}}
CBS and Turner pool their resources for the tournament. While CBS's [[Jim Nantz]] remains the lead voice for the tournament, CBS's analysts are joined by analysts from [[NBA TV]] and [[NBA on TNT|TNT]]. Turner also provides play-by-play man Brian Anderson, who calls [[MLB on TBS|baseball]] for TBS and formerly did the same with lead NBA voice [[Marv Albert]] until he ended his association with CBS. (TNT's #2 NBA voice, [[Kevin Harlan]], is already employed by CBS and thus does not require special arrangement to appear.)

Coverage originates from the [[CBS Broadcast Center]] in [[New York City]], and the Turner Sports studio in [[Atlanta]], where many of the studio shows for the latter division's coverage of the [[National Basketball Association]] and [[Major League Baseball]] emanate from.&lt;ref name="CBS/Turner talent"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS, Turner combine talent rosters|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/2011-01-18/cbs-turner-combine-talent-rosters|author=[[Turner Sports]]|publisher=NCAA.com|date=January 18, 2011|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS's college basketball studio host [[Greg Gumbel]] and ''[[Inside the NBA]]'' host [[Ernie Johnson, Jr.]] split hosting duties in the New York studio while [[Turner Sports]]'s [[Casey Stern]] hosts in the Atlanta studio. Johnson's colleagues on ''Inside the NBA'', [[Charles Barkley]] and [[Kenny Smith]], join CBS analyst [[Clark Kellogg]] in the studio in New York City while Stern is joined by NBA TV’s [[Steve Smith (basketball)|Steve Smith]], [[CBS Sports Network]]’s [[Wally Szczerbiak]], and CBS's [[Seth Davis]] in Atlanta.
==Graphics==
===2011-2015===
During the first five years of the TV deal, all games used Turner Sports graphics. Games on CBS simply used the CBS logo on Turner's graphics package, including the Final Four and National Championship Game.
===2016-present===
With CBS Sports unveiling a new graphics package at [[Super Bowl 50]] in February 2016, the new CBS graphics were used for March Madness as well. Despite this being the first year that the Final Four and National Championship aired on TBS (as part of an every-other-year arrangement), the 2016 CBS graphics are now used for all games, including those on TBS, TNT and TruTV. However, the games use a slightly different version of the scoreboard that has the network logo in the middle, and in black, as opposed to the usual white logo on the left. For TBS/TNT/TruTV games, the network logo simply replaces the CBS eye logo.

This tournament version of the scoreboard is anchored to the edges of the screen with shadows, which light up in team colors after a made basket, an effect not seen on CBS's graphics anywhere else.

==Theme music==
As previously mentioned, all four networks use a variation of the ''CBS College Basketball Theme'' during the tournament. Although CBS uses this arrangement for the tournament, they still use the arrangement that has been in use since 2004 during its [[College Basketball on CBS|regular season coverage]].

During all intros and outros into commercial breaks in the 2014 coverage, Spanish coverage [[Galavision]] used ''[[Fiesta (Denise Rosenthal album)|Fiesta]]'' by Chilean Singer [[Denise Rosenthal]], all broadcasters used ''[[Shot At The Night]]'' by [[The Killers]] as the theme/bumper music.

During select intros and into commercial breaks in the 2016 coverage, all broadcasters used ''Turn Up'' by [[The Heavy (band)|The Heavy]] as the bumper music.

For the 2017 tournament, all broadcasts used [[Something Just Like This]] by American EDM group [[The Chainsmokers]] and British group [[Coldplay]], as its bumper music.

'''''Nixon v. Fitzgerald''''', 457 U.S. 731 (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Nixon v. Fitzgerald|link=|volume=457|page=731|pin=|year=1982}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States]] court case that dealt with [[Immunity from prosecution|immunity]] from suit of government officials performing discretionary functions when their action did not violate clearly established law.

==Background==

[[A. Ernest Fitzgerald]] filed a lawsuit against government officials claiming that he lost his position as a contractor with the [[United States Air Force]] because of testimony made before [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/457/731|title=Nixon v. Fitzgerald|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the people listed in the lawsuit was former [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]]. Nixon argued that a [[President of the United States|president]] cannot be sued for actions taken while in office. The [[trial court|trial]] and [[court of appeals|appellate court]] rejected the President's claim of immunity and the case went to the Supreme Court.

==Opinion==
In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the President is entitled to absolute immunity from [[Legal liability|liability]] for civil damages based on his official acts. The court emphasized that the President is not immune from ''criminal'' charges stemming from his official (or unofficial) acts while in office.  

The court noted that a grant of absolute immunity to the President would not leave the President with unfettered power. The Court stated that there were formal and informal checks on presidential action that did not apply with equal force to other executive officials. The court observed that the President was subjected to constant scrutiny by the press. It noted that vigilant oversight by Congress would also serve to deter presidential abuses of office, as well as to make credible the threat of impeachment. The court determined that other incentives to avoid misconduct existed, including a desire to earn reelection, the need to maintain prestige as an element of presidential influence, and a President's traditional concern for his historical stature.

This decision was clarified by ''[[Clinton v. Jones]]'', in which the Court held that a President is subject to civil suits for actions committed ''before'' he assumes the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Clinton v. Jones|link=|volume=520|page=681|pin=|year=1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paraguayan nationality law''' is based on the principle of [[Jus soli]]. The nationality law is based on the Chapter 3 of the [[Constitution of Paraguay#Constitution of 1992|Paraguayan Constitution of 1992]].

==Birth in Paraguay==
Any person born in [[Paraguay]] acquires Paraguayan citizenship at birth. The only exception applies to children of persons in the service of a foreign government (like foreign diplomats).

==Paraguayan citizenship by descent==
[[File:Pas paraguay16.jpg|thumb|The Paraguayan passport can be used as a proof of Paraguayan citizenship]]
Though based for the most part on the principle of Jus soli, Paraguayan law authorizes the acquisition of Paraguayan citizenship by descent ([[jus sanguinis]]) in two cases:
*a person born outside Paraguay of a Paraguayan parent who is in the service of the Paraguay government is considered Paraguayan ; and
*a person born outside Paraguay of a Paraguayan parent is considered Paraguayan, provided that that person either be registered with a Paraguayan parent.

== Naturalisation as a Paraguayan citizen ==
Foreigners may apply for Paraguayan citizenship if they meet the following criteria:
*being older than 18 years old.
*permanent resident in Paraguay for at least 3 years.
*having a good behavior following the law.

==Loss of citizenship==
The two possible ways in which a Paraguayan may lose citizenship are by voluntarily obtaining a foreign citizenship and renouncing Paraguayan citizenship; or, in the case of naturalized Paraguayan citizens, living outside of Paraguay for more than three years.

'''Peacefire''' is a [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[website]], with a registered address in [[Bellevue, Washington]], dedicated to "preserving [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights for [[Internet]] users, particularly those younger than 18". It was founded in August 1996 by [[Bennett Haselton]], who still runs it. The site's motto is, "You'll understand when you're younger."

== History ==
{{Main|Bennett Haselton#PeaceFire}}

==Activism==
Peacefire is primarily concerned with [[free speech]] rights and [[internet censorship]], and providing information to the public about this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Oakes |first1= Elizabeth H. |last2= Greene |first2= Jeffrey D. |date= 2004 |title= Social Science Resources in the Electronic Age: Government and Civics, Volume III |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kcUYJ2Pqr1MC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=obofEJiUc0&amp;sig=yfieSgfzNx_U-Pqx2njNU3bGmgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZheOVN_PAo_ooATqpYHQAw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= Westport, CT |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |page= 101 |isbn= 9781573564762 |accessdate= December 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors on the site have been opponents of web content [[Internet filter|filtering]] and [[content-control software]], which they refer to as "censorware".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Oakes |first= Chris |date= March 9, 2000 |title= Censorware Exposed Again |url= http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2000/03/34842?currentPage=all |newspaper= Wired |location= |accessdate= December 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have offered information and tools for defeating several common web filters, which has been controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Hanback, Jr. |first= James |date= November 5, 1998 |title= Useless Protection: A Nashville teen challenges censorship on the Internet |url= http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/useless-protection/Content?oid=1182639 |newspaper= Nashville Scene |location= |accessdate= December 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the website's self-description in 2007:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Thomas |first= Robert Murray |date= 2008 |title= What Schools Ban and Why |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Eu1_ZTMaggYC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qQm92uERmo&amp;sig=-E1gRkZtJcEOHTYcTHgOxnUz1VY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FCuOVOGoE9XToAT_6oKQCw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |page= 51 |isbn= 9780313352980 |accessdate= December 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The site has conducted long battles against the most commonly used filter programs, including, most famously, [[Net Nanny]], [[SurfControl|CyberPatrol]], and [[Bess (content-control software)|Bess]]. "In particular, Peacefire has demonstrated that the filter programs suppress political speech and filter preferentially for corporate and [[Conservatism|conservative]] causes. In other cases, Peacefire has presented evidence that several filtering programs block some websites without having a human being review those sites first, despite the filtering companies' claims to the contrary. However, Peacefire is not usually active against filters that act in a more neutral way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Along with publishing ways of bypassing these programs, Peacefire publishes criticism of them and information about their practices, such as [[SurfWatch]] blocking gay and lesbian websites and then unblocking them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://peacefire.org/censorware/SurfWatch/ |title= SurfWatch examined |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Peacefire |publisher= |accessdate= December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common test that Peacefire runs is to create web pages filled with content clipped from news items. In particular, they will take quotes from conservative politicians that seem politically sensitive. They will then submit the site to a filter and see if it gets blocked. They will then point out that the content deemed "inappropriate" on their pages was, in fact, "appropriate" when coming from a corporate (or conservative [[blog]]) site. They also routinely search out sites of [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[progressivism|progressive]] content to see if they are blocked. They then compile a report to point out how the said software is discriminatory and restrictive of free speech/free access in what it censors. They offer these reports to the software makers and later follow up to see if any corrective measures have been taken.

The site is also involved in alerting the online community of efforts to pass laws restricting content to websites. Peacefire's own website is often blocked, either in part or whole, by filtering software, and the organization has both sued and been threatened with lawsuits in [[Civil procedure|civil court]] in the [[United States]]. Anyone of any age can become a member by signing up for the site's low-volume, announcement-only [[electronic mailing list]].

The '''Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs''' of 1961 is an international [[treaty]] to prohibit production and supply of specific (nominally [[narcotic]]) drugs and of drugs with similar effects except under [[licence]] for specific purposes, such as medical treatment and research.  As noted below, its major effects included updating the [[Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs|Paris Convention]] of 13 July 1931 to include the vast number of synthetic opioids invented in the intervening thirty years and a mechanism for more easily including new ones. From 1931 to 1961, most of the families of synthetic opioids had been developed, including drugs related to [[methadone]], [[pethidine]] (meperidine/Demerol), [[morphinans]] and [[dextromoramide]] (Palfium, Palphium, Jetrium, Dimorlin, marketed solely in the Netherlands). Research on [[fentanyl]]s  and  [[piritramide]] (R-3365, Pirium, Dipidolor, Piridolan, among others) was also nearing fruition at that point.

Earlier treaties had only controlled [[opium]], [[coca]], and derivatives such as [[morphine]], [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]]. The Single Convention, adopted in 1961, consolidated those treaties and broadened their scope to include [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and drugs whose effects are similar to those of the drugs specified. The [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] and the [[World Health Organization]] were empowered to add, remove, and transfer drugs among the treaty's four schedules of controlled substances. The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] was put in charge of administering controls on drug production, international trade, and dispensation. The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) was delegated the Board's day-to-day work of monitoring the situation in each country and working with national authorities to ensure compliance with the Single Convention.&lt;!--The UN Secretary-General delegated this responsibility to the UNODC; the UNODC is not mentioned in the COCK SMOOCHtreaty itself.--&gt; This treaty has since been supplemented by the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], which controls [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|MDMA]], and other psychoactive pharmaceuticals, and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], which strengthens provisions against [[money laundering]] and other drug-related offenses.

As of February 2018, the Single Convention has 186 state parties. The [[Holy See]], the [[State of Palestine]] plus all [[member states of the United Nations]] are state parties, with the exception of [[Chad]], [[East Timor]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Kiribati]], [[Nauru]], [[Samoa]], [[South Sudan]], [[Tuvalu]], and [[Vanuatu]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Influence on domestic legislation==
Since the Single Convention is not self-executing, Parties must pass laws to carry out its provisions, and the UNODC works with countries' legislatures to ensure compliance. As a result, most of the national drug statutes in the UNODC's legal library share a high degree of conformity with the Single Convention and its supplementary treaties, the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] and the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}
The Single Convention has been used as the basis for the standardization of national drug-control laws. In particular, the United States' [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970 and the United Kingdom's [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] were designed to fulfill treaty obligations.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Both Acts include analogous schemes of drug Scheduling, along with similar procedures for adding, removing, and transferring drugs among the Schedules. The Controlled Substances Act follows the Single Convention's lead in granting a public health authority a central role in drug-scheduling decisions.&lt;!--Under the Single Convention, that authority is the World Health Organization; under the CSA, that authority is the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Source: 21 U.S.C. § 811(b)--&gt; It also includes a provision mandating that federal authorities control all "drugs of abuse" in accordance with the strictness required by the Single Convention (''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090827113136/http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/csa/811.htm 21 U.S.C. § 811(d)]'').

==History==
The [[League of Nations]] adopted several drug control treaties prior to World War II, such as the [[International Opium Convention]], and ''International Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs (1925)''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1928/5.html "International Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs, and Protocol. ATS 5 of 1928."]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaty Series. Retrieved on 15 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; specifying uniform controls on addictive drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[opium]], and its derivatives. However, the lists of substances to be controlled were fixed in the treaties' text; consequently, it is necessary to periodically amend or supersede the conventions through the introduction of new treaties to keep up with advances in chemistry. In a 1954 interview with [[Harry J. Anslinger]], who was the United States Commissioner Of Narcotics at the time, the cumbersome process of conference and state-by-state ratification could last for a period of numerous decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Traffic in Narcotics|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1954-01-01_1_page002.html|website=United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime|publisher=UNODC|accessdate=27 October 2014|date=1 January 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Senate of Canada]] committee report notes, "The work of consolidating the existing international drug control treaties into one instrument began in 1948, but it was 1961 before an acceptable third draft was ready."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/ille-e/rep-e/repfinalvol3-e.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021117164232/http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/ille-e/rep-e/repfinalvol3-e.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 November 2002 |title=Final Report – Volume III |publisher=Parl.gc.ca |accessdate=15 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] convened a [[plenipotentiary]] conference of 73 nations for the adoption of a single convention on narcotic drugs. That meeting was known as the '''United Nations Conference on Narcotic Drugs'''. Canadian William B. McAllister, Q.C., notes that the participating states organized themselves into five distinct caucuses:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
* '''Organic states group''': As producers of the organic raw materials for most of the global drug supply, these countries had been the traditional focus of international drug control efforts. They were open to socio-cultural drug use, having lived with it for centuries. While [[India]], Turkey, [[Pakistan]] and [[Burma]] took the lead, the group also included the [[coca]]-producing states of [[Indonesia]] and the Andean region of South America, the [[opium]]- and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-producing countries of South and Southeast Asia, and the cannabis-producing states in the [[Horn of Africa]]. They favored weak controls because existing restrictions on production and export had directly affected large segments of their domestic population and industry. They supported national control efforts based on local conditions and were wary of strong international control bodies under the UN. Although essentially powerless to fight the [[prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] philosophy directly, they effectively forced a compromise by working together to dilute the treaty language with exceptions, loopholes and deferrals. They also sought development aid to compensate for losses caused by strict controls.
* '''Manufacturing states group''': This group included primarily Western industrialized nations, the key players being the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, [[Switzerland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[West Germany]], and Japan. Having no cultural affinity for organic drug use and being faced with the effects that [[drug abuse]] was having on their citizens, they advocated very stringent controls on the production of organic raw materials and on illicit trafficking. As the principal manufacturers of synthetic psychotropics, and backed by a determined industry lobby, they forcefully opposed undue restrictions on medical research or the production and distribution of manufactured drugs. They favored strong supranational control bodies as long as they continued to exercise de facto control over such bodies. According to W.B. McAllister's ''Drug Diplomacy in the Twentieth Century'', their strategy was essentially to "shift as much of the regulatory burden as possible to the raw-material-producing states while retaining as much of their own freedom as possible."
* '''Strict control group''': These were essentially non-producing and non-manufacturing states with no direct economic stake in the drug trade. The key members were France, Sweden, [[Brazil]], and the [[Republic of China]]. Most of the states in this group were culturally opposed to drug use and suffered from abuse problems. They favored restricting drug use to medical and scientific purposes and were willing to sacrifice a degree of national [[sovereignty]] to ensure the effectiveness of supranational control bodies. They were forced to moderate their demands in order to secure the widest possible agreement.
* '''Weak control group''': This group was led by the [[Soviet Union]] and often included its allies in Europe, Asia and Africa. They considered drug control a purely internal issue and adamantly opposed any intrusion on national sovereignty, such as independent inspections. With little interest in the drug trade and minimal domestic abuse problems, they refused to give any supranational body excessive power, especially over internal decision-making.
* '''Neutral group''': This was a diverse group including most of the African countries, Central America, sub-Andean South America, Luxembourg and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. They had no strong interest in the issue apart from ensuring their own access to sufficient drug supplies. Some voted with political blocs, others were willing to trade votes, and others were truly neutral and could go either way on the control issue depending on the persuasive power of the arguments presented. In general, they supported compromise with a view to obtaining the broadest possible agreement.
These competing interests, after more than eight weeks of negotiations, finally produced a compromise treaty. Several controls were watered down; for instance, the proposed mandatory [[embargo]]es on nations failing to comply with the treaty became recommendatory. The 1953 New York Opium Protocol, which had not yet entered into force, limited opium production to seven countries; the Single Convention lifted that restriction, but instituted other regulations and put the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] in charge of monitoring their enforcement. A compromise was also struck that allowed heroin and some other drugs classified as particularly dangerous to escape absolute prohibition.&lt;ref name="unodc2"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1962-01-01_1_page007.html   The Plenipotentiary Conference for the adoption of a Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Single Convention created four Schedules of controlled substances and a process for adding new substances to the Schedules without amending the treaty. The Schedules were designed to have significantly stricter regulations than the two drug "Groups" established by predecessor treaties. For the first time, [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] was added to the list of internationally controlled drugs. In fact, regulations on the cannabis plant – as well as the [[opium]] [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], the [[coca]] bush, poppy straw and cannabis tops – were embedded in the text of the treaty, making it impossible to deregulate them through the normal Scheduling process. A 1962 issue of the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]]' ''[[Bulletin on Narcotics]]'' proudly announced that "after a definite transitional period, all non-medical use of narcotic drugs, such as opium smoking, opium eating, consumption of cannabis (hashish, marijuana) and chewing of coca leaves, will be outlawed everywhere. This is a goal which workers in international narcotics control all over the world have striven to achieve for half a century."&lt;ref name="unodc2"/&gt;

A 3 August 1962 Economic and Social Council resolution ordered the issuance of the Commentary on the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.&lt;ref name="drugtext1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugtext.org/library/legal/treat/commentary/ |accessdate=14 March 2005 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal commentary was created by the [[United Nations Secretary-General]]'s staff (specifically, [[Adolf Lande]], former Secretary of the Permanent Central Narcotics Board and Drug Supervisory Body), operating under a mandate to give "an interpretation of the provisions of the Convention in the light of the relevant conference proceedings and other material."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1962-08-03_4.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111123219/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/resolution_1962-08-03_4.html |date=11 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commentary contains the Single Convention's [[legislative history]] and is an invaluable aid to interpreting the treaty.

[[Image:Pr112801 fig1.jpeg|frame|right|The Single Convention was the first international treaty to prohibit [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].]]The Single Convention entered into force on 13 December 1964, having met [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 41: ENTRY INTO FORCE|Article 41]]'s requirement of 40 ratifications. As of 1 January 2005, 180 [[Sovereign state|states]] were Parties to the treaty.&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaty_adherence.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107151130/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaty_adherence.html |date=7 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Cambodia]], have committed to becoming Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/USSD-INCSR/95/Financial/Chapter03.html |title=INCSR '96: Financial Crimes And Money Laundering: Country Chapters: Cambodia to Dominican Republic |publisher=Hri.org |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 1971, the [[UN Economic and Social Council]] called a conference of plenipotentiaries to consider amendments to the Single Convention. The conference met at the United Nations Office at Geneva from 6 to 24 March 1972, producing the 1972 [[Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. The amendments entered into force on 8 August 1975.&lt;ref name="unodc1"/&gt;

On 11 November 1990, mechanisms for enforcing the Single Convention were expanded significantly by the entry into force of the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]], which had been signed at [[Vienna]] on 20 December 1988. The [[s:United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances#PREAMBLE|Preamble]] to this treaty acknowledges the inadequacy of the Single Convention's controls to stop "steadily increasing inroads into various social groups made by illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances". The new treaty focuses on stopping [[organized crime]] by providing for international cooperation in apprehending and convicting gangsters and starving them of funds through [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]], asset freezing, and other methods. It also establishes a system for placing precursors to Scheduled drugs under international control. Some non-Parties to the Single Convention, such as [[Andorra]], belong to this treaty and thus are still under the international drug control regime.

==Medical and other drug uses==
&lt;div style="float:right;width:250px;"&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chewing-coca.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Parties are required to phase out the traditional practice of [[coca]] leaf chewing.]] --&gt;
[[Image:Opium-processing.jpg|frame|right|Under Article 37, "Any drugs, substances and equipment used in or intended for the commission of any of the offenses . . . shall be liable to seizure and confiscation."]]
&lt;/div&gt;
The Single Convention repeatedly affirms the importance of medical use of controlled substances. The [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#PREAMBLE|Preamble]] notes that "the medical use of [[narcotic]] drugs continues to be indispensable for the relief of pain and suffering and that adequate provision must be made to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs for such purposes". Articles 1, 2, 4, 9, 12, 19, and 49 contain provisions relating to "medical and scientific" use of controlled substances. In almost all cases, parties are permitted to allow dispensation and use of controlled substances under a [[Medical prescription|prescription]], subject to record-keeping requirements and other restrictions.

The Single Convention unambiguously condemns [[drug addiction]], however, stating that "addiction to narcotic drugs constitutes a serious evil for the individual and is fraught with social and economic danger to mankind". It takes a [[prohibition (drugs)|prohibitionist]] approach to the problem of drug addiction, attempting to stop all non-medical, non-scientific use of narcotic drugs. [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 4: GENERAL OBLIGATIONS|Article 4]] requires nations to limit use and possession of drugs to medicinal and scientific purposes. [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 49: TRANSITIONAL RESERVATIONS|Article 49]] allows countries to phase out [[coca]] leaf chewing, [[opium]] smoking, and other traditional drug uses gradually, but provides that "the use of cannabis for other than medical and scientific purposes must be discontinued as soon as possible."

The discontinuation of these prohibited uses is intended to be achieved by cutting off supply. Rather than calling on nations to prosecute drug users, the treaty focuses on traffickers and producers. As of 2013, 234 substances are controlled under the Single Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unodc.org/wdr/en/nps.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109081820/https://www.unodc.org/wdr/en/nps.html |archivedate=9 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penal provisions==
[[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]] requires Parties to adopt measures against "cultivation, production, manufacture, extraction, preparation, possession, offering, offering for sale, distribution, purchase, sale, delivery on any terms whatsoever, brokerage, dispatch, dispatch in transit, transport, importation and exportation of drugs contrary to the provisions of this Convention," as well as "[i]ntentional participation in, conspiracy to commit and attempts to commit, any of such offences, and preparatory acts and financial operations in connexion with the offences referred to in this article". Article 36 does not directly require criminalization of all the above; it states only in the cases of (unspecified) serious offences that they "shall be liable to adequate punishment particularly by imprisonment or other penalties of deprivation of liberty."

The Article also provides for [[extradition]] of drug offenders, although a Party has a right to refuse to extradite a suspect if "competent authorities consider that the offense is not sufficiently serious." A 1971 amendment to the Article grants nations the discretion to substitute "treatment, education, after-care, [[Substance-abuse rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] and social reintegration" for criminal penalties if the offender is a drug abuser. A [[loophole]] in the Single Convention is that it requires Parties to place anti-drug laws on the books, but does not clearly mandate their enforcement, except in the case of drug cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugtext.org/library/legal/treat/1971commentary/article12.htm |title=Article 12 AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE 22 OF THE SINGLE CONVENTION |publisher=Drugtext.org |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020172104/http://www.drugtext.org/library/legal/treat/1971commentary/article12.htm |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug enforcement varies widely between nations. Many European countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, and, most famously, the [[Netherlands]], do not prosecute all petty drug offenses. Dutch [[Coffeehouse|coffee shops]] are allowed to sell small amounts of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to consumers. However, the [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport]]'s report, ''Drugs Policy in the Netherlands'', notes that large-scale "[p]roduction and trafficking are dealt with severely under the criminal law, in accordance with the UN Single Convention. Each year the Public Prosecutions Department deals with an average of 10,000 cases involving infringements of the Opium Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taima.org/nl/nl_uk.htm |title=Taima and Baby Name |publisher=Taima.org |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most severe penalties for drug trafficking are handed down in certain Asian countries, such as [[Malaysia]], which mandate capital punishment for offenses involving amounts over a certain threshold. [[Capital punishment in Singapore|Singapore mandates the death penalty]] for trafficking in 15 g (half an ounce) of heroin, 30 g of cocaine or 500 g of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/sw02/020412re.htm |title=Singapore death penalty shrouded in silence |publisher=Singapore-window.org |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most nations, such as France and the United States, find a middle ground, imposing a spectrum of sanctions ranging from [[probation]] to [[life imprisonment]] for drug offenses.

The Single Convention's penal provisions frequently begin with clauses such as "Subject to its constitutional limitations, each Party shall . . ." Thus, if a nation's constitution prohibited instituting the criminal penalties called for by the Single Convention, those provisions would not be binding on that country. However, Professor [[Cindy Fazey]]'s ''A Growing Market: The Domestic Cultivation of Cannabis'' points out, "Whilst this strategy may be practical politics for some countries, critics will ask why it has taken almost half a century to discover that the UN conventions conflict with a constitutional principle. The argument is particularly difficult to deploy for countries like [[UK|Britain]], where constitutional principles are not formalized or codified to any significant degree." However the current move in [[Switzerland]] to enshrine cannabis decriminalization in the national constitution by popular initiative could profit from this rule.

==Possession for personal use==
[[Image:Small time bust.gif|frame|right|Different nations have drawn different conclusions as to whether the treaty requires criminalization of drug possession for personal use.]]It is unclear whether or not the treaty requires criminalization of drug possession for personal use. The treaty's language is ambiguous, and a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] would probably be required to settle the matter decisively. However, several commissions have attempted to tackle the question. With the exception of the Le Dain Commission, most have found that states are allowed to legalize possession for personal use.

The Canadian [[Le Dain Commission of Inquiry into the Non-Medical Use of Drugs]]' 1972 report cites circumstantial evidence suggesting that states must prohibit possession for personal use:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfdp.ca/sen1841.htm |title=Drugs and Drug Policy in Canada: |publisher=Cfdp.ca |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:It has generally been assumed that "possession" in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]] includes possession for use as well as possession for the purpose of trafficking. This is a reasonable inference from the terms of [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 4: GENERAL OBLIGATIONS|Article 4]], which obliges the parties "to limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs." There is also [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 33: POSSESSION OF DRUGS|Article 33]], which provides that "The Parties shall not permit the possession of drugs except under legal authority." [...] On the face of [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 26: THE COCA BUSH AND COCA LEAVES|Article 26]] it would not be unreasonable to argue that what is contemplated is possession for the purpose of trafficking rather than possession for use, and that the requirements of the article are satisfied if the former kind of possession is made a penal offense. The prevailing view, however, is that the word "possession" in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]] includes simple possession for use.

However, LeDain himself concludes

&lt;blockquote&gt;The costs to a significant number of individuals, the majority of whom are young people, and to society generally, of a policy of prohibition of simple possession are not justified by the potential for harm of cannabis and the additional influence which such a policy is likely to have upon perception of harm, demand and availability. We, therefore, recommend the repeal of the prohibition against the simple possession of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/ledain/ldc6a.htm |title=Conclusions and Recommendations of Gerald Le Dain, Heinz Lehmann, J. Peter Stein |publisher=Druglibrary.org |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Canadian Department of National Health and Welfare's 1979 report, ''The Single Convention and Its Implications for Canadian Cannabis Policy'', counters with circumstantial evidence to the contrary:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfdp.ca/canrep/appendix_a.htm |title=Appendix A – Cannabis Report |publisher=Cfdp.ca |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The substantive argument in support of simple possession falling outside the scope of [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]] is founded on the assumption that it is intended to insure a penal response to the problem of illicit trafficking rather than to punish drug users who do not participate in the traffic. (See United Nations, 1973:112; Noll, 1977:44–45) The Third Draft of the Single Convention, which served as the working document for the 1961 Plenipotentiary Conference, contained a paragraph identical to that which now appears as [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]], subparagraph 1(a). This paragraph was included in a chapter entitled ''Measures Against Illicit Traffickers'', but the format by which the Third Draft was divided into chapters was not transferred to the Single Convention, and this, apparently, is the sole reason why this chapter heading, along with all others, was deleted. (See United Nations, 1973:112) [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]] is still located in that part of the Convention concerned with the illicit trade, sandwiched between [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 35: ACTION AGAINST THE ILLICIT TRAFFIC|Article 35]] (''Action Against the Illicit Traffic'') and [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs|Article 37]] (''Seizure and Confiscation''). In addition, it should be noted that the word "use," suggesting personal consumption rather than trafficking, appears in conjunction with "possession" in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 4: GENERAL OBLIGATIONS|Article 4]] (which pertains to non-penal "general obligations"), but not in the penal provisions of [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]].

The Sackville Commission of South Australia concluded in 1978 that:
:. . . the Convention does not require signatories to make either use or possession for personal use punishable offenses ... This is because 'use' is not specifically covered by Article 36 and the term 'possession' in that Article and elsewhere can be read as confined to possession for the purpose of dealing".

The American [[Shafer Commission]] reached a similar conclusion in 1972, finding "that the word 'possession' in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]] refers not to possession for personal use but to Possession as a link in illicit trafficking."

The Canadian Department of National Health and Welfare report cites the Commentary itself in backing up its interpretation:&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;
:The official Commentary on the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, as prepared by the office of the U.N. Secretary-General, adopts a permissive interpretation of possession in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 36: PENAL PROVISIONS|Article 36]]. It notes that whether or not the possession of drugs (including prohibited forms of cannabis) for personal use requires the imposition of penal sanctions is a question which may be answered differently in different countries. Further, the Commentary notes that parties which interpret Article 36 as requiring a punitive legal response to simple possession, may undoubtedly choose not to provide for imprisonment of persons found in such possession, but to impose only minor penalties such as fines or even censure (since possession of a small quantity of drugs for personal consumption may be held not to be a serious offense under article 36... and only a serious offense is liable to adequate punishment particularly by imprisonment or other penalties of deprivation of liberty).

The [[Bulletin on Narcotics]] attempted to tackle the question in 1977:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/bulletin/bulletin_1977-01-01_4_page004.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225083949/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/bulletin/bulletin_1977-01-01_4_page004.html |date=25 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Since some confusion and misunderstanding had existed in the past and some instances still persist in respect of the legal position laid down in the international treaties concerning the relationship between penal sanctions and drug abuse, some clarifying remarks are called for. These were already offered at the XIth International Congress on Penal Law. 5 They were reiterated at the Fifth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. 6 The international treaties in no way insist on harsh penal sanctions with regard to drug abuse, as is sometimes alleged by persons criticising the international drug control system; the treaties are much more subtle and flexible than sometimes interpreted.
:First of all, Article 4 of the Single Convention contains the general obligations for Parties to this Convention to "take such legislative and administrative measures as may be necessary, subject to the provisions of this Convention, to limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs." From the contents of this provision it is clear that use of drugs and their possession for personal consumption has also to be limited by legislation and administrative measures exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. Consequently, "legalization" of drugs in the sense of making them freely available for non-medical and non-scientific purposes-as it is sometimes demanded by public mass media and even experts in discussions on the subject-is without any doubt excluded and unacceptable under the present international drug control system as established by the international treaties. The question, however, remains whether Parties are obliged by the international treaties to apply penal sanctions for unauthorized use and unauthorized possession of drugs for personal consumption. It is on this point that confusion still exists and clarification is needed.
:It is a fact that "use" (or "personal consumption") is not enumerated amongst the punishable offences in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the Single Convention. Although, as mentioned above, Parties are required to limit the use of drugs exclusively to medical and scientific purposes, the Single Convention does not require them to attain the goal by providing penal sanctions for unauthorized "use" or "personal consumption" of drugs.
:Unauthorized "possession" of drugs is mentioned in paragraph 1 of Article 36, but from the context it is clear that, as stated in the Official Commentary by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, "possession" of drugs ''for personal consumption'' is not to be considered a "punishable offence" by a Party to the Single Convention. The whole international drug control system envisages in its ''penal provisions'' the ''illicit traffic'' in drugs; this also holds true for the 1972 Protocol Amending the Single Convention and for the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. As there is no obligation to provide penal sanctions for "use" in the sense of personal consumption and "possession" of drugs for personal consumption, any criticism levelled against the international drug control system by protagonists in favour of the so-called "liberalization" or decriminalization or "de-penalization" of use and possession of drugs for personal consumption is quite beside the point.

==Schedules of drugs==
&lt;!--Yes, Schedules I and II have the same criteria.--&gt;
The Single Convention's Schedules of drugs range from most restrictive to least restrictive, in this order: Schedule IV, Schedule I, Schedule II, Schedule III. The list of drugs initially controlled was annexed to the treaty. [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 3: CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF CONTROL|Article 3]] states that in order for a drug to be placed in a Schedule, the [[World Health Organization]] must make the findings required for that Schedule, to wit:
* '''Schedule I''' – The substance is liable to similar abuse and productive of similar ill effects as the drugs already in Schedule I or Schedule II, or is convertible into a drug.
* '''Schedule II''' – The substance is liable to similar abuse and productive of similar ill effects as the drugs already in Schedule I or Schedule II, or is convertible into a drug.
* '''Schedule III''' – The preparation, because of the substances which it contains, is not liable to abuse and cannot produce ill effects; and the drug therein is not readily recoverable.
* '''Schedule IV''' – The drug, which is already in Schedule I, is particularly liable to abuse and to produce ill effects, and such liability is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages.

'''Schedule I''', according to the Commentary, is the category of drugs whose control provisions "constitute the standard regime under the Single Convention."&lt;ref name="drugtext1"/&gt; The principal features of that regime are:
* Limitation to medical and scientific purposes of all phases of narcotics trade (manufacture, domestic trade, both [[wholesale]] and retail, and [[international trade]]) in, and of the possession and use of, drugs;
* Requirement of governmental authorization (licensing or state ownership) of participation in any phase of the narcotics trade and of a specific authorization (import and export authorization) of each individual international transaction;
* Obligation of all participants in the narcotics trade to keep detailed records of their transactions in drugs;
* Requirement of a [[medical prescription]] for the supply or dispensation of drugs to individuals;
* A system of limiting the quantities of drugs available, by manufacture or import or both, in each country and territory, to those needed for medical and scientific purposes.

'''Schedule II''' drugs are regulated only slightly less strictly than Schedule I drugs. The Commentary confirms, "Drugs in Schedule II are subject to the same measures of control as drugs in Schedule I, with only a few exceptions":&lt;ref name="drugtext1"/&gt;
* The drugs are not subject to the provisions of [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 30: TRADE AND DISTRIBUTION|Article 30]], paragraphs 2 and 5, as regards the retail trade.
* Governments are thus not bound to prevent the accumulation of drugs in Schedule II in the possession of retail distributors, in excess of the quantities required for the normal conduct of business.
* Medical prescriptions for the supply or dispensation of these drugs to individuals are not obligatory.
* Such drugs are also exempted from the provision – which in fact is no more than a suggestion – concerning the use of official prescription forms in the shape of counterfoil books issued by the competent governmental authorities or by authorized professional associations.
* Parties to the Single Convention need not require that the label under which a drug in Schedule II is offered for sale in the retail trade show the exact content by weight or percentage.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Codeine-preparations.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Preparations containing 100 mg per dosage unit or less of [[codeine]] are eligible for Schedule III status. The [[acetaminophen]] in these pills supposedly makes them less likely to be abused.]] --&gt;'''Schedule III''' "contains preparations which enjoy a privileged position under the Single Convention, i.e. are subject to a less strict regime than other Preparations," according to the Commentary.&lt;ref name="drugtext1"/&gt; Specifically:
* Government authorizations are not required for each import or export of preparations in Schedule III. The import certificate and export authorization system laid down in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 31: SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE|Article 31]], paragraphs 4 to 15, which governs the international transactions in drugs and their preparations, does not apply to the preparations in Schedule III.
* The only estimates and statistical returns that a Party need furnish to the INCB in reference to Schedule III preparations are estimates of the quantities of drugs to be utilized for the compounding of preparations in Schedule III, and information on the amounts of drugs actually so used.

'''Schedule IV''' is the category of drugs, such as heroin, that are considered to have "particularly dangerous properties" in comparison to other drugs ([[ethanol]] is left unregulated). According to [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 2: SUBSTANCES UNDER CONTROL|Article 2]], "The drugs in Schedule IV shall also be included in Schedule I and subject to all measures of control applicable to drugs in the latter Schedule" as well as whatever "special measures of control"; each Party deems necessary. This is in contrast to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, which has five Schedules ranging from Schedule I (most restrictive) to Schedule V (least restrictive), and the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]], which has four Schedules ranging for Schedule I (most restrictive) to Schedule IV (least restrictive).

Under certain circumstances, Parties are required to limit Schedule IV drugs to research purposes only:
:(b) A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in, possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including clinical trials therewith to be conducted under or subject to the direct supervision and control of the Party.

The Commentary explains two situations in which this provision would apply:
:For a considerable period of time – and still at the time of writing – there has been no significant diversion of legally manufactured drugs from legal trade into illicit channels; but if a Government were unable to prevent such a diversion of drugs in Schedule IV, a situation would arise in which the measures of prohibition mentioned in subparagraph (b) would be "the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare". Whether this was or was not the case would be left to the judgement of the Party concerned whose bona fide opinion on this matter could not be challenged by any other Party.
:Another situation in which measures of prohibition would be "appropriate" for the protection of public health and welfare might exist where the members of the medical profession administered or prescribed drugs in Schedule IV in an unduly extensive way, and other less radical measures, such as warnings by public authorities, professional associations or manufacturers, were ineffective. It may however be assumed that such a situation could rarely if ever arise.
The Commentary notes that "Whether the prohibition of drugs in Schedule IV ([[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and cannabis resin, [[desomorphine]], heroin, [[ketobemidone]]) should be mandatory or only recommended was a controversial question at the Plenipotentiary Conference." The provision adopted represents "a compromise which leaves prohibition to the judgement, though theoretically not to the discretion, of each Party." The Parties are required to act in good faith in making this decision, or else they will be in violation of the treaty.

==Power structure==
The Single Convention gives the [[UN Economic and Social Council]]'s [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]] (CND) power to add or delete drugs from the Schedules, in accordance with the [[World Health Organization]]'s findings and recommendations. Any Party to the treaty may request an amendment to the Schedules, or request a review of the Commission's decision. The Economic and Social Council is the only body that has power to confirm, alter, or reverse the CND's scheduling decisions. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] can approve or modify any CND decision, except for scheduling decisions.

The CND's annual meeting serves as a forum for nations to debate drug policy. At the 2005 meeting, France, Germany, the [[Netherlands]], Canada, Australia and [[Iran]] rallied in opposition to the UN's zero-tolerance approach in international drug policy. Their appeal was vetoed by the United States, while the United Kingdom delegation remained reticent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/48329 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906144820/http://www.sundayherald.com/48329 |date=6 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, U.S. [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] Director [[John P. Walters|John Walters]] clashed with [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] Executive Director [[Antonio Maria Costa]] on the issue of [[needle exchange]] programs. Walters advocated strict prohibition, while Costa opined, "We must not deny these addicts any genuine opportunities to remain HIV-negative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/news_detail.asp?id=3482 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527123116/http://www.advocate.com/news_detail.asp?id=3482 |date=27 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) is mandated by [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 9: COMPOSITION AND FUNCTIONS OF THE BOARD|Article 9]] of the Single Convention to "endeavour to limit the cultivation, production, manufacture and use of drugs to an adequate amount required for medical and [[science|scientific]] purposes, to ensure their availability for such purposes and to prevent illicit cultivation, production and manufacture of, and illicit trafficking in and use of, drugs." The INCB administers the estimate system, which limits each nation's annual production of controlled substances to the estimated amounts needed for medical and scientific purposes.

[[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 21: LIMITATION OF MANUFACTURE AND IMPORTATION|Article 21]] provides that "the total of the quantities of each drug manufactured and imported by any country or territory in any one year shall not exceed the sum of" the quantity:
* Consumed, within the limit of the relevant estimate, for medical and scientific purposes;
* Used, within the limit of the relevant estimate, for the manufacture of other drugs, of preparations in Schedule Ill, and of substances not covered by this Convention;
* Exported;
* Added to the stock for the purpose of bringing that stock up to the level specified in the relevant estimate; and
* Acquired within the limit of the relevant estimate for special purposes.

[[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 21 bis: LIMITATION OF PRODUCTION OF OPIUM|Article 21 bis]], added to the treaty by a 1971 amendment, gives the INCB more enforcement power by allowing it to deduct from a nation's production quota of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[opium]], and [[coca]] the amounts it determines have been produced within that nation and introduced into the illicit traffic. This could happen as a result of failing to control either illicit production or [[Pharmaceutical diversion|diversion]] of licitly produced opium to illicit purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugtext.org/library/legal/treat/1971commentary/article11.htm |title=Article 11 NEW ARTICLE 21 BIS |publisher=Drugtext.org |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030117090047/http://www.drugtext.org/library/legal/treat/1971commentary/article11.htm |archivedate=17 January 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the INCB can essentially punish a narcotics-exporting nation that does not control its illicit traffic by imposing an [[economic sanction]] on its medicinal narcotics industry.&lt;!--Despite the title of Article 21 bis, this applies to cannabis, and coca as well as opium. See Article 2, Section 5.--&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:ECOSOC meeting.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[UN Economic and Social Council]] is the only body with the power to overrule the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]]' scheduling decisions.]] --&gt;The Single Convention exerts power even over those nations that have not ratified it. The International Narcotics Board states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incb.org/e/role/menu.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316040817/http://www.incb.org/e/role/menu.htm |date=16 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The fact that the system generally works well is mainly due to the estimates system that covers all countries whether or not parties to the Convention. Countries are under an obligation not to exceed the amounts of the estimates confirmed or established by the INCB.
[[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 14: MEASURES BY THE BOARD TO ENSURE THE EXECUTION OF PROVISIONS OF THE CONVENTION|Article 14]] authorizes the INCB to recommend an [[embargo]] on imports and exports of drugs from any noncompliant nations. The INCB can also issue reports critical of noncompliant nations, and forward those reports to all Parties. This happened when the United Kingdom reclassified cannabis from Class B to class C, eliminating the threat of arrest for possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/280/roadtovienna.shtml |title=Road to Vienna: British Government Chides International Narcotics Control Board on Cannabis Rescheduling Critique |publisher=Stopthedrugwar.org |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See [[Cannabis reclassification in the United Kingdom]].''

The most controversial decisions of the INCB are those in which it assumes the power to interpret the Single Convention. Germany, the [[Netherlands]], Switzerland, and Spain continue to experiment with medically supervised injection rooms, despite the INCB's objections that the Single Convention's allowance of "scientific purposes" is limited to clinical trials of pharmaceutical grade drugs and not public health interventions.&lt;ref name="ffdlr1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffdlr.org.au/commentary/Single%20convention.htm |accessdate=14 March 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050615164310/http://ffdlr.org.au/commentary/Single%20convention.htm |archivedate=15 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These European nations have more leverage to disregard the Board's decisions because they are not dependent on licit psychoactive drug exports (which are regulated by the Board). As international lawyer Bill Bush notes, "Because of the [[Tasmanian opium poppy farming industry|Tasmanian]] opium poppy industry, Australia is more vulnerable to political pressure than, say, Germany."&lt;ref name="ffdlr1"/&gt;

The INCB is an outspoken opponent of drug legalization. Its 2002 report rejects a common argument for drug reform, stating, "Persons in favour of legalizing illicit drug use argue that drug abusers should not have their basic rights violated; however, it does not seem to have occurred to those persons that drug abusers themselves violate the basic rights of their own family members and society." The report dismisses concerns that drug control conflicts with principles of [[limited government]] and self-determination, arguing, "States have a moral and legal responsibility to protect drug abusers from further self-destruction." The report takes a [[majoritarian]] view of the situation, declaring, "Governments must respect the view of the majority of lawful citizens; and those citizens are against illicit drug use."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incb.org/e/ind_ar.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414083225/http://www.incb.org/e/ind_ar.htm |date=14 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 48: DISPUTES|Article 48]] designates the [[International Court of Justice]] as the arbiter of disputes about the interpretation or application of the Single Convention, if [[mediation]], [[negotiation]], and other forms of [[alternative dispute resolution]] fail.

==Limitation of scope==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Amphetamines-pic.jpg|frame|right|[[Amphetamine]]s were found to be insufficiently [[morphine]]-like, [[cocaine]]-like, or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-like to fall within the scope of the Single Convention.]] --&gt;The Single Convention allows only drugs with morphine-like, cocaine-like, and cannabis-like effects to be added to the Schedules. The strength of the drug is not relevant; only the similarity of its effects to the substances already controlled. For instance, [[etorphine]] and [[acetorphine]] were considered sufficiently morphine-like to fall under the treaty's scope, although they are many times more potent than morphine. However, according to the Commentary:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugtext.org/library/legal/treat/commentary/article03.htm |title=Article 3 Changes in the Scope of Control |publisher=Drugtext.org |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020172107/http://www.drugtext.org/library/legal/treat/commentary/article03.htm |archivedate=20 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The [[Office of Legal Affairs of the United Nations]] ruled, in an opinion given to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its twenty-third session, that [[barbiturate]]s, [[tranquillizer]]s and [[amphetamine]]s were outside the scope of the Single Convention. It pointed out that there was an understanding at all stages of the drafting of the Single Convention, in particular at the Plenipotentiary Conference of 1961 which adopted that treaty, that the Convention was not applicable to these three types of substances, although the effects of amphetamines have some degree of similarity to cocaine, and those of barbiturates and tranquillizers to morphine.

Since cannabis is a [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]] (although some dispute this), the Commentary speculates that [[mescaline]], [[psilocybin]], [[tetrahydrocannabinol]], and [[LSD]] could have been considered sufficiently cannabis-like to be regulated under the Single Convention; however, it opines, "It appears that the fact that the potent hallucinogenics whose abuse has spread in recent years have not been brought under international narcotics control does not result from legal reasons, but rather from the view of Governments that a regime different from that offered by the Single Convention would be more adequate." That different regime was instituted by the 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Convention on Psychotropic Drugs' scope can include any drug not already under international control if the [[World Health Organization]] finds that:
* The substance has the capacity to produce "[a] state of dependence" AND "[c]entral nervous system stimulation or depression, resulting in hallucinations or disturbances in motor function or thinking or behaviour or perception or mood"; or
* The substance has the capacity to produce similar abuse and similar ill effects as [[LSD]] or one of the other controlled substances enumerated in Convention; or
* There is sufficient evidence that the substance is being or is likely to be abused so as to constitute a public health and social problem warranting the placing of the substance under international control.
The reason for sharply limiting the scope of Single Convention to a few types of drugs while letting the Convention on Psychotropic Drugs cover the rest was concern for the interests of industry. Professor [[Cindy Fazey]]'s ''The Mechanics and Dynamics of the UN System for International Drug Control'' explains, "concerted efforts by drug manufacturing nations and the pharmaceutical industry ensured that the controls on psychotropics in the 1971 treaty were considerably looser than those applied to organic drugs in the Single Convention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forward-thinking-on-drugs.org/review1.html |title=de beste bron van informatie over forward thinking on drugs.

A failed 24 March 2003 [[European Parliament]] committee report noted the disparity in how drugs are regulated under the two treaties:&lt;ref name="report_A5-2003-0085"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report A5-2003-0085|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&amp;reference=A5-2003-0085&amp;language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chanvre-info1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanvre-info.ch/info/en/article602.html |title=Working document on the UN conventions on drugs |publisher=Chanvre-info.ch |accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The 1971 Convention, which closely resembles the Single Convention, establishes an international control which is clearly less rigorous for the so-called 'psychotropic' substances, generally produced by the pharmaceutical industry. . . The parallel existence of the Single Convention and the 1971 Convention have led to certain illogical effects such as the fact that a plant ([[cannabis]]) containing at most 3% of a principal element is dealt with more severely than the pure substance at 100% ([[tetrahydrocannabinol]] or THC).

For this reason, the [[European Parliament]], [[Transnational Radical Party]], and other organizations have proposed removing cannabis and other drugs from the Single Convention and scheduling them under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://servizi.radicalparty.org/documents/index.php?func=detail&amp;par=213 |title=Concept Paper For Campaign By The Transnational Radical Party And The International Antiprohibitionist League To Reform The Un Conventions On Drugsby Marco Cappato And Marco Perduca |language=it |publisher=Servizi.radicalparty.org |date=8 June 1998 |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113145210/http://servizi.radicalparty.org/documents/index.php?func=detail&amp;par=213 |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the provisions of the Single Convention regarding the national supply and demand of opium to make morphine contribute to the global shortage of essential poppy-based pain relief medicines. According to the Convention, governments can only request raw poppy materials according to the amount of poppy-based medicines used in the two preceding years. Consequently, in countries where underprescription is chronic due to the high prices of morphine and lack of availability and medical training in the prescription of poppy-based drugs, it is impossible to demand enough raw poppy materials from the INCB, as the Convention's regulating body, to meet the country's pain relief needs. As such, 77% of the world's poppy-based medicine supplies are used by only six countries (See: Fischer, B J. Rehm, and T Culbert, "Opium based medicines: a mapping of global supply, demand and needs" in
Spivack D. (ed.) Feasibility Study on Opium Licensing in Afghanistan, Kabul, 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;85–86.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/008_publication] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112122748/http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/008_publication |date=12 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Many critics of the Convention cite this as one of its primary limitations and the [[World Health Organization]] is currently attempting to increase prescription of poppy-based drugs and to help governments of emerging countries in particular alter their internal regulations to be able to demand poppy-based medicines according to the Convention's provisions (see the [[WHO]] "Assuring Availability of Opioid Analgesics for Palliative Care"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/document/e76503.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201034539/http://www.euro.who.int/document/e76503.pdf |date=1 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[The Senlis Council]], a European drug policy thinktank, proposes creating a second-tier supply system that would complement the existing system without altering the balance of its relatively closed supply and demand system. The Council, who support licensing poppy cultivation in Afghanistan to create Afghan morphine, believe the opium supply in this country could go a long way to easing the pain relief needs of sufferers in emerging countries by producing a cheap poppy-based medicine solution (see [The Senlis Council]: "Poppy for Medicine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/events/London_event_on_afghanistan/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101184627/http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/events/London_event_on_afghanistan/documents/poppy_medicine_technical_dossier |date=1 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of cannabis==
[[Image:indoor.jpeg|frame|right|Articles 23 and 28 of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs require cannabis-producing nations to have a government agency that controls cultivation.]]

===Cultivation===
The Single Convention places the same restrictions on [[cannabis]] cultivation that it does on [[opium]] cultivation. [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 23: NATIONAL OPIUM AGENCIES|Article 23]] and [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 28: CONTROL OF CANNABIS|Article 28]] require each Party to establish a government agency to control cultivation. Cultivators must deliver their total crop to the agency, which must purchase and take physical possession of them within four months after the end of harvest. The agency then has the exclusive right of "importing, exporting, wholesale trading and maintaining stocks other than those held by manufacturers."

In the United States, the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] fulfills that function. NIDA administers a contract with the [[University of Mississippi]] to grow a 1.5 acre (6,000 m²) crop of cannabis every other year; that supply comprises the only licit source of cannabis for medical and research purposes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nida.nih.gov/about/organization/nacda/marijuanastatement.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220192325/http://www.nida.nih.gov/about/organization/nacda/marijuanastatement.html |date=20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 2000, [[Prairie Plant Systems]] was awarded a five-year contract to grow cannabis in the [[Flin Flon]] [[mining|mine]] for [[Health Canada]], that nation's licit cannabis cultivation authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediresource.sympatico.ca/health_news_detail.asp?channel_id=28&amp;news_id=1138] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824015904/http://mediresource.sympatico.ca/health_news_detail.asp?channel_id=28&amp;news_id=1138 |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Note that although Article 23 itself only mentions opium, Article 28 causes that Article to also apply to cannabis.--&gt;

[[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 28: CONTROL OF CANNABIS|Article 28]] specifically excludes industrial [[hemp]] from these regulations, stating, "This Convention shall not apply to the cultivation of the cannabis plant exclusively for industrial purposes (fibre and seed) or horticultural purposes." Hemp-growing countries include China, Romania, France, Germany, [[Netherlands]], UK, and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saunabucks.com/hemp2/hemp-cultivation.html |accessdate=10 April 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041228120444/http://www.saunabucks.com/hemp2/hemp-cultivation.html |archivedate=28 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescheduling proposals===
There is some controversy over whether cannabis is "particularly liable to abuse and to produce ill effects" and whether that "liability is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages," as required by Schedule IV criteria. In particular, the discovery of the [[cannabinoid receptor]] system in the late 1980s revolutionized scientific understanding of cannabis' effects, and much anecdotal evidence has come to light about the plant's medical uses. The Canadian Senate committee's report notes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/cancan/vol3/repfinalvol3-e/css/repfinalvol3-e_31.htm |title=repfinalvol3-e_31 |publisher=Drugtext.org |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020172110/http://www.drugtext.org/library/reports/cancan/vol3/repfinalvol3-e/css/repfinalvol3-e_31.htm |archivedate=20 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:At the U.S.'s insistence, [[cannabis]] was placed under the heaviest control regime in the Convention, Schedule IV. The argument for placing cannabis in this category was that it was widely abused. The WHO later found that cannabis could have medical applications after all, but the structure was already in place and no international action has since been taken to correct this anomaly.

The Commentary points out the theoretical possibility of removing cannabis from Schedule IV:&lt;ref name="drugtext1"/&gt;
:Those who question the particularly harmful character of cannabis and cannabis resin may hold that the Technical Committee of the Plenipotentiary Conference was under its own criteria not justified in placing these drugs in Schedule IV; but the approval of the Committee's action by the Plenipotentiary Conference places this inclusion beyond any legal doubt. Should the results of the intensive research which is at the time of this writing being undertaken on the effects of these two drugs so warrant, they could be deleted from Schedule IV, and these two drugs, as well as extracts and tinctures of cannabis, could be transferred from Schedule I to Schedule II.

[[Cindy Fazey]], former Chief of Demand Reduction for the [[United Nations Drug Control Programme]], has pointed out that it would be nearly impossible to loosen international cannabis regulations. Even if the Commission on Narcotic Drugs removed cannabis from Schedule IV of the Single Convention, prohibitions against the plant would remain imbedded in [[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 28: CONTROL OF CANNABIS|Article 28]] and other parts of the treaty. Fazey cited amendment of the Articles and state-by-state denunciation as two theoretical possibilities for changing cannabis' international legal status, while pointing out that both face substantial barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fuoriluogo.it/arretrati/2003/apr_17_en.htm |title=aprile 2003 |publisher=fuoriluogo.it |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423160616/http://www.fuoriluogo.it/arretrati/2003/apr_17_en.htm |archivedate=23 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2002 interview, INCB President [[Philip O. Emafo]] condemned European cannabis decriminalization measures:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/newsletter_2002-12-31_1_page004.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007200907/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/newsletter_2002-12-31_1_page004.html |date=7 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:It is possible that the cannabis being used in Europe may not be the same species that is used in [[developing country|developing countries]] and that is causing untold health hazards to the young people who are finding themselves in hospitals for treatment. Therefore, the INCB's concern is that cannabis use should be restricted to medical and scientific purposes, if there are any. Countries who are party to the Single Convention need to respect the provisions of the conventions and restrict the use of drugs listed in Schedules I to IV to strictly medical and scientific purposes.

However, [[Kathalijne Buitenweg]] on the [[European Parliament]]'s Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs issued a report on 24 March 2003 criticizing the Single Convention's scheduling regime:&lt;ref name="report_A5-2003-0085"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chanvre-info1"/&gt;
:These schedules show that the main criterion for the classification of a substance is its medical use. In view of the principle according to which the only licit uses is those for medical or scientific purposes (art. 4), plants or substances deprived of this purpose are automatically considered as particularly dangerous. Such is the case for [[cannabis]] and cannabis resin which are classified with heroin in group IV for the sole reason that they lack therapeutic value. A reason which is in any event disputable, since cannabis could have numerous medical uses.

There have been several lawsuits over whether cannabis' Schedule IV status under the Single Convention requires total [[prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] at the national level. In 1970, the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to implement the UN treaty, placing marijuana into Schedule I on the advice of [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare|Assistant Secretary of Health]] [[Roger O. Egeberg]]. His letter to [[Harley Orrin Staggers|Harley O. Staggers]], Chairman of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, indicates that the classification was intended to be provisional:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marijuananews.com/marijuananews/cowan/science_and_the_end_of_marijuana.htm |title=Science And The End Of Marijuana Prohibition |author=Jon Gettman |date=13 May 1999 |accessdate=28 April 2007 |publisher=MarijuanaNews.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216160850/http://marijuananews.com/marijuananews/cowan/science_and_the_end_of_marijuana.htm |archivedate=16 December 2006 }} Text originally presented at the 12th International Conference on Drug Policy Reform.&lt;/ref&gt;
:Some question has been raised whether the use of the plant itself produces "severe psychological or physical dependence" as required by a schedule I or even schedule II criterion. Since there is still a considerable void in our knowledge of the plant and effects of the active drug contained in it, our recommendation is that marijuana be retained within schedule I at least until the completion of certain studies now underway to resolve the issue.

The reference to "certain studies" is to the then-forthcoming [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]]. In 1972, the Commission released a report favoring decriminalization of marijuana. The [[Richard Nixon]] administration took no action to implement the recommendation, however. In 1972, the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] filed a rescheduling petition under provisions of the Act. The government declined to initiate proceedings on the basis of their interpretation of U.S. treaty commitments. A federal Court ruled against the government and ordered them to process the petition (''NORML v. Ingersoll 497 F.2d 654 (1974)''). The government continued to rely on treaty commitments in their interpretation of scheduling related issues concerning the NORML petition, leading to another lawsuit (''NORML v. DEA 559 F.2d 735 (1977)''). In this decision, the Court made clear that the Act requires a full scientific and medical evaluation and the fulfillment of the rescheduling process before treaty commitments can be evaluated. ''See [[Removal of cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act]]''.

Cannabis leaves (as opposed to buds) are a special case. The Canadian Health Protection Branch's ''Cannabis Control Policy: A Discussion Paper'' found that, while the Single Convention requires nations to take measures against the misuse of, and illicit traffic in, cannabis buds, a ban is not required on licit production, distribution, and use of the leaves.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;
:The Single Convention defines "cannabis" as the flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops) from which the resin has not been extracted. (Art. 1, s-para. 1(b)) It is generally accepted that this definition permits the legalization of the leaves of the cannabis plant, provided that they are not accompanied by the flowering or fruiting tops. However, uncertainty arises by virtue of paragraph 3 of Article 28 which requires parties to the Convention to "adopt such measures as may be necessary to prevent the misuse of, and illicit traffic in, the leaves of the cannabis plant." In summary, it appears that parties are not obliged to prohibit the production, distribution and use of the leaves (since they are not drugs, as defined the Convention), although they must take necessary, although unspecified, measures to prevent their misuse and diversion to the illicit trade.

==Related treaties==

===Predecessor treaties===
[[s:Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Article 44: TERMINATION OF PREVIOUS INTERNATIONAL TREATIES|Article 44]] provided that the Single Convention's entry into force terminated several predecessor treaties, including:
* The [[International Opium Convention]], signed at [[The Hague]] on 23 January 1912;
* The [[Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium]], signed at [[Geneva]] on 11 February 1925;
* The International Opium Convention, signed at Geneva on 19 February 1925;
* The [[Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs]], signed at Geneva on 13 July 1931;
* The [[Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East]], signed at [[Bangkok]] on 27 November 1931;
* The [[Protocol Amending the Agreements, Conventions and Protocols on Narcotic Drugs concluded at The Hague on 23 January 1912, at Geneva on 11 February 1925 and 19 February 1925, and 13 July 1931, at Bangkok on 27 November 1931 and at Geneva on 26 June 1936]] (except as it affected the latter), signed at [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]] on 11 December 1946;&lt;!--That is to say, the Protocol was terminated, except for its effects on the 1936 treaty.--&gt;

===Supplementary treaties===
The Single Convention is supplemented by two other major drug control treaties:
* The [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] controls [[LSD]], [[MDMA]], and other drugs whose unique psychoactive effects exclude them from the scope of the Single Convention. It was signed at [[Vienna]] on 21 February 1971.
* The [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] adds additional enforcement mechanisms for fighting drug traffickers, including asset [[Asset forfeiture|forfeiture]] provisions. The Convention also establishes a system of drug [[wikt:Precursor|precursor]] regulation, dividing them into two tables of listed chemicals. It was signed at Vienna on 20 December 1988.

Like many institutions that draw public interest, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has frequently been depicted in [[fiction]], often in the form of [[legal drama]]. In some instances, real decisions rendered by real courts are dramatized, as in ''[[Gideon's Trumpet]]'' and the seminal trial in ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]''. Other depictions are purely fictional, but center on realistic issues that come before the court. Television series centered on dramatizing the happenings of the court have proven to be short-lived, and have tended to receive overall negative critical reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postgazette.com/tv/20020115first0115fnp6.asp TV Reviews: 'First Monday' guilty of mediocrity], 15 January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=11246 FIRST MONDAY!! Talk Back!!], 15 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; One reason that has been suggested is that the Supreme Count is a [[appellate court|court of appeals]], whereas most legal drama portrays [[trial court]]s. Appeals may appear "bookish" in contrast to the theatrical storytelling of trials, especially juries. Furthermore, American audiences are not very knowledgeable about or interested in the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Why TV Shows About the Supreme Court Tank | first = Michelle | last = Olsen | work = LexisNexis | date = 29 September 2010 | accessdate = 9 May 2016 | url = https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/litigation/b/litigation-blog/archive/2010/09/29/why-tv-shows-about-the-supreme-court-tank.aspx?Redirected=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television series==
*''[[First Monday]]'' (13 episodes in 2002, starring [[Joe Mantegna]] and [[James Garner]]). Mantegna portrayed a fictional Joseph Novelli, a moderate and potential swing vote appointed to a Supreme Court evenly divided between conservatives and liberals. Garner was the conservative Chief Justice.
*''[[The Court (TV series)|The Court]]'' (3 episodes, also in 2002, starring [[Sally Field]])
*''[[The West Wing (television)|The West Wing]]'' involved frequent discussions or depictions of [[List of The West Wing politicians#Supreme Court of the United States|fictional past and present Supreme Court justices]]. Two episodes ("[[The Short List]]" in 1999, and "[[Celestial Navigation (The West Wing)|Celestial Navigation]]" in 2000) center on the nomination of "Roberto Mendoza," played by [[Edward James Olmos]], as the first Hispanic Justice.  A third episode, "[[The Supremes (The West Wing)|The Supremes]]" in 2004, dealt with the issue of preserving ideological balance on the Court.  The President makes a deal with the Republican Congress to simultaneously appoint a very liberal judge "Evelyn Baker Lang" (played by [[Glenn Close]]) as the Court's first female Chief Justice, and a very conservative judge, "Christopher Mulready" (played by [[William Fichtner]]) as an Associate Justice. The 2000 episode "[[Take This Sabbath Day]]" opened with a scene depicting the Court's main chamber.
*In ''[[Boston Legal]]'', [[Alan Shore]] and [[Denny Crane]] argue two cases before the Supreme Court during the series. In "The Court Supreme", Shore argues for overturning the death penalty sentence of a mentally handicapped man convicted of raping a young girl, which was based heavily on the 2008 case ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]''. In the series finale "Last Call", Shore returns to the Court to argue for Crane being allowed access to an [[experimental drug]] for [[Alzheimer's disease]].
*In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode, "[[Itchy &amp; Scratchy: The Movie]]", [[Bart Simpson]] is shown as ultimately becoming [[Chief Justice of the United States]].
*In the ''[[Picket Fences]]'' episode "May It Please the Court", broadcast on 18 November 1994, defense attorney Douglas Wambaugh (played by [[Fyvush Finkel]]) and [[District Attorney]] John Littleton  (played by [[Don Cheadle]]) engaged in oral arguments before the Court (with actors playing the real justices); Supreme Court oral argument veteran [[Alan Dershowitz]] [[guest star]]red as himself, advising Wambaugh on strategy for addressing the Court. The case dealt with the admissibility of a murderer's confession.
*''[[Recount (film)|Recount]]'' is a 2008 movie depicting the [[Florida election recount]] at the end of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential Election]] in the United States. At the end of the movie, actors who looked like attorney [[David Boies]], attorney [[Theodore Olson]], and the nine justices sitting on the Supreme Court in 2000 reenacted key sections from oral argument of ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''. Two actors read sections of opinions written by [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[John Paul Stevens]].
*''[[Outlaw (TV series)|Outlaw]]'' (8 episodes in 2010) starred [[Jimmy Smits]] as the fictional Cyrus Garza, a Justice who resigns from the bench to start his own law firm, as a way to more directly promote the ends of justice. The show was placed on hiatus after three episodes, and was never brought back.&lt;ref name=HRhiatus&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/10/nbc-outlaw-stop.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008061401/http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/10/nbc-outlaw-stop.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 October 2010|title=NBC putting ‘Outlaw’ on production hiatus|date=6 October 2010|last=Hibberd|first=James|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 October 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hiatus&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/tag/outlaw-production-stopped/|title=NBC's 'Outlaw' Goes On Production Hiatus|date=6 October 2010|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline.com|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]'' (Season 2) features Associate Justice Verna Thornton ([[Debra Mooney]]) as a primary antagonist for the first half of the second season. Aware that President Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III ([[Tony Goldwyn]]) ascended to the presidency through voter fraud in [[Defiance County, Ohio]] she attempted to have him assassinated. Suffering with terminal cancer, she was pressured by Vice President Sally Langston ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]) to give up her seat, to which she refused. She is eventually suffocated in hospital by President Grant so she cannot reveal the truth about his election, with her death being made to look like the result of the cancer. 
*In ''[[House of Cards (season 3)|House of Cards]]'' (Season 3), President Frank Underwood ([[Kevin Spacey]]) is approached by Associate Justice Robert Jacobs ([[Jonathan Hogan]]) who requests he be allowed to retire due to having started to develop [[alzheimers]]. However, Underwood expresses his desire for Jacobs to remain on the court until he has passed groundbreaking job creation legislation. Underwood later tries to discourage his political rival, [[Solicitor General of the United States|Solicitor General]] Heather Dunbar ([[Elizabeth Marvel]]) from running against him by offering her Jacob's place on the court, but she announces her candidacy before he can formally nominate her. Another named member of the court is Associate Justice Moretti ([[Kris Andrews]]). The court is shown to be composed of three women and six men, two of whom are [[African-American]].
*''[[Political Animals (miniseries)|Political Animals]]'' (2012 miniseries) features Associate Justice Diane Nash ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]), the first [[openly gay]] member of the court. She serves as a friend and mentor to Secretary of State Elaine Barrish ([[Sigourney Weaver]]).

*''[[Veep]]'' (Season 6) sees former President Stuart Hughes nominated to a vacant position on the Supreme Court by President Laura Montez ([[Andrea Savage]]) after the death of Associate Justice Tenny. Hughes becomes the second person after [[William Howard Taft]] to serve as both President and as a Supreme Court justice. 
* In ''[[Homeland (season 7)|Homeland]]'' (Season 7), President Elizabeth Keane ([[Elizabeth Marvel]])'s decision to fire four members of her [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] to prevent them from invoking the [[25th Amendment]] is challenged in the Supreme Court, who reject her dismissal of the secretaries as an illegal act and thus allow the 25th Amendment to be invoked and her to be temporarily replaced in office by Vice President Ralph Warner ([[Beau Bridges]]).
*''[[Designated Survivor (TV series)|Designated Survivor]]'' (Season 2) features Chief Justice Peter Koemann ([[Keith Dinicol]]) in the season finale, who confronts President Tom Kirkman ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) about his Chief of Staff trying to influence the decisions of the court in relation to potential criminal charges being brought against him.
*''[[Salvation (TV series)|Salvation]]'' (Season 2) features the Supreme Court deciding in a case between President Pauline Mackenzie ([[Tovah Feldshuh]]) and the treacherous former Vice President/Acting President Monroe Bennett ([[Sasha Roiz]]), with Bennett arguing that his removal from office and Mackenzie's reinstatement was illegal and unconstitutional. However, when the court is deadlocked 4-4 and the tiebreaker Chief Justice Martin Cheng ([[Hiro Kanagawa]]) is still deliberating , a blackmailed [[court clerk]] detonates a suicide vest in the building, seriously injuring Cheng and causing moderate injuries to the other judges. As riots break out in [[Washington, DC]] between supporters of Bennett and Mackenzie, Cheng is woken from a medically induced coma and is able to release his decision, rendering the case 5-4 in favour of Pauline Mackenzie. Another named justice is Associate Justice Praeger ([[Corina Akeson]]).
*''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]'' (Season 4) features a Supreme Court session in episode 13, in which the protagonist, Annalise Keating ([[Viola Davis]]), brings a class action suit against the Federal Government for not providing effective public legal counsel, thus violating the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|6th Amendment]]. This episode is also part of the crossover event between the same-universe TV show [[Scandal (TV series)|''Scandal'']], and also features Olivia Pope ([[Kerry Washington]]). The court is composed of Chief Justice Peter Montgomery ([[Jesse D. Goins]]), Associate Justice Mark Spivey ([[Tom Irwin (actor)|Tom Irwin]]), Associate Justice Helen Bass ([[Cathy Ladman]]), Associate Justice Alberto Gutierrez ([[Ruben Pla]]), Associate Justice Strickland ([[Denis Arndt]]) and two other unnamed justices. 
*''[[Shooter (TV series)|Shooter]]'' (Season 3) features a significant subplot regarding the Supreme Court. A secretive [[cabal]] known as Atlas operating within the government pressures President Alvarez ([[Benito Martinez (actor)|Benito Martinez]]) to nominate appellate judge and former [[Attorney General of Utah]] Ray Brooks ([[Michael O'Neill (actor)|Michael O'Neill]]) to fill the vacant seat of [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Chief Justice]], which would allow him to act as their [[swing vote]] in decisions for decades to come. However, when Brooks commits suicide due to atrocities he took part in during the [[Vietnam War]], the President refuses to nominate a replacement recommended by the group, and decides to work towards taking them out. Having needed Brooks swing vote in an upcoming case, the group tries and fails to assassinate Associate Justice Gibson ([[Rhea Perlman]]) to swing the vote 4-3 in their favour, bombing the Supreme Court building as a distraction and attempting to use a [[suicide bomber]] to kill the evacuated justices at a safehouse in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. Other named justices include Associate Justice Ramiro Dominguez ([[Castulo Guerra]]) and Associate Justice Stewart.

The '''tender years doctrine''' is a [[legal doctrine|legal principle]] in [[family law]] since the late nineteenth century. In [[common law]], it presumes that during a child's "tender" years (generally regarded as the age of four and under), the mother should have [[child custody|custody]] of the child. The doctrine often arises in [[divorce]] proceedings.

== History ==
Historically, English [[family law]] gave custody of the children to the father after a divorce because the father is able to provide for the child. Until the 19th century, the women had few individual rights and obligations, most being derived through their fathers or husbands. In the early nineteenth century, [[Caroline Norton]], a prominent social reformer author, journalist, and society beauty, began to campaign for the right of women to have custody of their children. Norton, who had undergone a divorce and been deprived of her children, worked with politicians and eventually was able to convince the British Parliament to enact legislation to protect mothers' rights, with the [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]], which gave some discretion to the judge in a child custody case and established a presumption of maternal custody for children under the age of seven years maintaining the responsibility from financial support to their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Custody of Infants Act 1873|1873]] the Parliament extended the presumption of maternal custody until a child reached sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Sanford|title=That They May Thrive|journal=Journal of Contemporary Health Law &amp; Policy|date=1992|volume=8|issue=1|page=123|url=https://scholarship.law.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1528&amp;context=jchlp|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine spread in many states of the world because of the [[British Empire]]. By the end of the 20th century, the doctrine was abolished in most  of the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

{{Disputed section|date=October 2017}}

== Application ==

=== In United States ===
Tender years doctrine was also frequently used in the 20th century being gradually replaced towards the end of the century, in the legislation of most states, by the "[[best interests of the child]]" doctrine of custody.&lt;ref name=fsu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/frames/254/mcnefram.html|title=LAGGING BEHIND THE TIMES: PARENTHOOD, CUSTODY, AND GENDER BIAS IN THE FAMILY COURT|author=Cynthia A. McNeely|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several courts have held that the tender years doctrine violates the [[equal protection clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2020&amp;context=law_lawreview|page=925|title=Child Custody Modification Under the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act: A Statute to End the Tug-of-War?|date=1989|author=C. Gail Vasterling|work=Washington University Law Review|volume=67|quote=Many courts consider the maternal preference doctrine to be gender discriminatory.  The Supreme Court of Alabama, for example, held that "the tender years presumption represents an unconstitutional gender-based classification which discriminates between fathers and mothers in child custody proceedings solely on the basis of sex."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Europe ===
The Tender Years doctrine was gradually abolished in the majority of the states of the [[European Union|EU]]. In those states the [[joint custody]] is the rule after divorce or the separation of the parents. The [[Principles of the European Family Law]] regarding the parental responsibilities mention in clear that the two parents are equal and their parental responsibilities should neither be affected by the dissolution or annulment of the marriage or other formal relationship nor by  the legal or factual separation between the parents.&lt;ref&gt;The document is issued by [[Commission on European Family Law]] and can be consulted [http://www.ceflonline.net/Reports/Principles%20PR%20English.pdf here]. See Principle 3:10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Maternal preference versus tender years doctrine ==
Critics of the family court system, and in particular [[father's rights]] groups, contend that although the tender years doctrine has formally been replaced by the best interests of the child rule, the older doctrine is still, in practice, the means by which child custody is primarily determined in family courts nationwide. Despite this, in 1989 the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]]’s Gender Bias Study reported that "Fathers who actively seek custody obtain either primary or joint physical custody over 70% of the time." {{fact|date=October 2017}}  However, others argue the 70% figure is extremely misleading because of its definition of joint custody being so broad as to include visitation rights among other issues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Misrepresentation of Gender Bias in the 1989 Report of the Gender Bias Committee of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court| url=http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics maintain that the father must prove the mother to be an unfit parent before he is awarded primary custody, while the mother need not prove the father unfit in order to win custody herself, and that this is contrary to the equal protection clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The tender years doctrine origin history modern usage and criticism|url=http://baysingerlaw.com/2016/06/13/tender-years-doctrine-origin-history-modern-usage-criticism/|accessdate=13 July 2016|work=baysingerlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Cauchi''' (17th century) was a minor Maltese philosopher who specialised in law.

==Life==
Little is known about the private life of Thomas Cauchi. Neither his dates of birth and death nor his birthplace in Malta are identified as yet. He might have lectured at the ''Collegium Melitense'' [[University of Malta|see]] in [[Valletta]]. He surely lectured in [[Messina]], [[Sicily]]. Unfortunately, most the works of Cauchi are as yet lost. At least three are known to have existed, all dealing with the philosophy of law. Of these just one is still extant, which is the third volume of what is thought to have been a triad.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, vol. 1, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, no known portrait of Cauchi is known to exist yet.

==Known works==
Cauchi’s only work which is still extant is '''''Institutionum Decisiones D[ivi] Iustiniani Imperatoris''''' (''Teachings about the Conclusions of the Holy Emperor Justinian''), written in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript is held at the [[National Library of Malta]], [[Valletta]], and marked as MS. 1286#1. It contains fifty-four back to back folios, and is basically a philosophical commentary on Roman law. The content was part of Cauchi’s ''corpus'' of lectures given at [[Messina]], [[Sicily]], in or before the date of its composition. The manuscript is divided into ‘Conclusions’ (each called a ''Decisio'') and numbered paragraphs.

{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}The '''Treaty of Maastricht''', signed in 1843 by [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], established the border between the two countries.

The '''Treaty of Saint Petersburg of 1825''' or the '''Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825''', officially the '''Convention Concerning the Limits of Their Respective Possessions on the Northwest Coast of America and the Navigation of the Pacific Ocean''',&lt;ref&gt;''International Environmental Law Reports, Vol. 1.'' ed. A. R. Robb. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. 1999, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; defined the boundaries between [[Russian America]] and British claims and possessions in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]] at [[parallel 54°40′ north]], which had the year before been established as the limit of overlapping American claims in the parallel [[Russo-American Treaty of 1824]]. The Russian sphere in the region was later [[Alaska Purchase|sold]] to the [[United States]], becoming [[Alaska]], while to the south of the division point was the British claim, the remnant of which today is coast of the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorenorth.com/library/history/bl-bjones3a.htm ''A Merged History of Canada and The United States''], Bill Jones, ExploreNorth.com website, see section "1825: Anglo-Russian Convention"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/bl-dates.htm Chronology of Alaska and Yukon history]&lt;/ref&gt; and associated rights and obligations concerning waters and ports in the region. The treaty, in establishing a vague division of coastal Russian interests and inland British interests northward from 56 degrees north, led to conflicting interpretations of the meaning of the treaty's wording which later manifested in the [[Alaska Boundary Dispute]] between the United States on the one hand, and Canada and the British Empire on the other.

Other terms of the treaty, including the right to navigation by British vessels to both commerce in the region affected, and also access to rivers crossing the designated boundary, were exercised by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1834 but were met with opposition by then [[Russian-American Company]] Governor [[Ferdinand von Wrangel|Wrangel]] in the form of warships and a blockade. This conflict, known as the ''Dryad'' affair,&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Shelest, [http://explorenorth.com/library/history/shelest.html The Dryad Affair: Corporate Warfare and Anglo-Russian Rivalry for the Alaskan Lisière], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; led to the [[RAC-HBC Agreement]], in which the RAC agreed to lease the mainland portion of the region south of [[Cape Spencer (Alaska)|Cape Spencer]] at the entrance to [[Cross Sound]] and the HBC promised to supply Russian America with foodstuffs and manufactured goods. In addition the HBC waived its demand for payments for damages incurred during the ''Dryad'' affair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fOscZfLNOQkC&amp;pg=PA154#v=onepage ''The Hudson's Bay Company'', page 154]&lt;/ref&gt; The same clauses enabled British access to the Stikine River goldfields in 1862 but were not assumed by the Americans upon their purchase of Russian interests in 1867, resulting in further conflict over British rights of access to the inland regions. The treaty's terms also played a part in the terms of the [[Bering Sea Arbitration]] and likewise in terms of other decisions in Alaska and US courts over marine and offshore interests.

'''''Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp v. iCraveTV''''' (2000 WL 255989 W.D.Pa.) was a court case in the
[[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]] which enjoined [[iCraveTV]], a Canadian TV streaming website, from operating within the US after finding it in violation of [[20th Century Fox]]'s, and several other motion picture studios and television networks, copyrights and trademarks. Granted January 1, 2000, this injunction, along with continued legal pressure, led to the iCraveTV's demise just 3 months after its debut.

==Background==

iCraveTV  allowed users to stream network television directly through their personal computers via the internet. Broadcasts of 17 networks from Buffalo, NY and Toronto, Canada were picked up via a rooftop antennae in Toronto, turned into a retransmission signal, digitized, and then streamed online through the use of [[RealPlayer]] software at iCraveTV.com.&lt;ref name=ipinbrief/&gt; The website was free for end-users however iCraveTV sold advertising spots to American and Canadian Companies.  It displayed these advertisements alongside the streamed original content. The website launched quietly on November 30, 1999 but grew rapidly; in December 2000 it had 800,000 unique visits and played 60 million instances of users being exposed to 30 second advertisements.&lt;ref name=columbia/&gt;

Under Canada's [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]] retransmission of broadcast signals in this manner is legal within Canada.&lt;ref name=crtc/&gt; Because this retransmission is not necessarily legal in other countries, iCraveTV restricted use of its site to Canadian residents. Upon first visit to the site, users had to enter their 3 digit Canadian area code, verify that they were in Canada by clicking a box that said "I'm in Canada", and agree to the terms of use.&lt;ref name=Geist/&gt; International users, however, were easily able to bypass these restrictions and made up 45% of the traffic to the website.&lt;ref name=ipinbrief/&gt;

==Positions Held in Court==

The plaintiffs in this case included several sports leagues, motion picture studios, and television networks, such as the National Football League, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, and the American Broadcasting Company. Plaintiffs contended that iCraveTV had copied and displayed several of their copyrighted works without their permission and that the site was too easily accessible within the US. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent iCraveTV from displaying works in the US based on violation of the US [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright]] and [[Lanham Act|Lanham (Trademark) Acts]].

iCraveTV representatives did not deny that they had copied copyrighted works, represented themselves as the authors, or publicly performed said works; rather they argued that their actions were legal in Canada, and that they did not intend for US residents to view the works on their site. Despite this argument, based on the precedent set in  Williams Elecs., Inc. v. Attic Int'l, Inc., 685 F.2d 870, 878 [215 USPQ 405] (3d Cir.1982) injunctions may be issued without proving willful or deliberate infringement.&lt;ref name=ipinbrief/&gt;

Regardless of where the broadcast originates, the Copyright Act gives jurisdiction to the district courts when the acts of infringement are committed within the US. In this case streaming constitutes an unauthorized public performance, which is a violation of the plaintiffs' rights as copyright owners.&lt;ref name = lans/&gt; Public performance was proven by an examination of the Real Video server log showing that 45% of iCraveTV's traffic came from IP addresses within the United States. Additionally, plaintiffs presented testimony and sworn affidavits establishing that the Pennsylvania residents had accessed iCraveTV's website.&lt;ref name=ipinbrief/&gt;

== Opinions of the Court==

The court found that iCraveTV had directly and willingly infringed upon the rights of the plaintiffs under 17 U.S.C § 106 by making unauthorized copies of, preparing derivative works of (by removing subtitle data), and publicly displaying copyrighted works throughout the US. iCraveTV was also found to be liable for contributory infringement of the same works by knowingly and materially contributing to infringement by its users within the US.

iCraveTV was found to be in violation of the Lanham Act by portraying itself as legitimate telecasters endorsed by the plaintiffs, and falsely stating that they owned copyrights on the streamed content. Additionally, iCraveTV violated the plaintiffs rights under the Lanham Act by infringing upon and diluting they trademarks with the intent of leveraging the plaintiffs reputation and goodwill.&lt;ref name=columbia/&gt;

Under the common law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, iCraveTV was also found to have participated in unfair competition and civil conspiracy that would irreparably harm the plaintiffs without an injunction.&lt;ref name=columbia/&gt;

On January 1, 2000 the court granted the Plaintiff's a temporary restraining order which enjoined iCraveTV from infringing upon the plaintiff's copyrights, trademarks, and trade names through any means including, but not limited to, online streaming.

==Subsequent Developments==

Rather than returning to court as dictated by the preliminary injunction ruling, iCraveTV and representatives of the motion picture, television, and professional sports industries came to an out-of-court settlement agreement.&lt;ref name=prnews/&gt;  The agreement stated that iCraveTV would no longer engage in illegal streaming of television signals into the US through the Internet.&lt;ref name=prnews/&gt;  The settlement also prohibited iCraveTV from seeking (or helping anyone else seek) a ruling on the legality of their form of Internet broadcasting in Canada.&lt;ref name=betanews/&gt;  In addition, the settlement required iCraveTV to withdraw a petition it made to Canada's Copyright Board asking for a suggestion on how much iCraveTV should be paying to fulfill the same copyright responsibilities met by other rebroadcasters.&lt;ref name=betanews/&gt;  Following the settlement, iCraveTV Chief Executive [[William Craig (broadcaster)|Bill Craig]] agreed to shut down the site.

In September 2010, Seattle-based company [[Ivi, Inc.|ivi]] launched a similar service as iCraveTV for watching television online at a flat monthly fee.&lt;ref name=iviprweb/&gt;  When a group of broadcaster and copyright holders filed copyright infringement claims against ivi that same month in [[WPIX, Inc. v. ivi, Inc.]], ivi argued that since the company simply retransmits unaltered content meant for the public, it meets the requirements necessary for the "passive carrier exemption" from copyright liability.&lt;ref name=scherb/&gt;  Unlike iCraveTV, ivi did not frame its retransmission in advertising, an act which could arguably be considered a modification of the original content.&lt;ref name=scherb/&gt;  In February 2011 the district court rejected ivi's argument, ruling that ivi's service did constitute copyright infringement and demanding the service shut down. In August 2012, an appeals court affirmed the decision.&lt;ref name=bloombergivi/&gt;

In September 2013, graduate student Benjamin Klass filed a net neutrality complaint against [[Bell Mobility]] with the [[Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) for its treatment of online video services.&lt;ref name=bellcbc/&gt;  In response to this complaint, the CRTC sent a series of questions to Bell to investigate the issue. Canadian academic [[Michael Geist]] argues that these questions demonstrate the existence of an iCraveTV legal framework.&lt;ref name=geist/&gt;  Per this framework, services can protect themselves from prosecution by claiming either the retransmission provision of Canada's Copyright Act or the CRTC's new media exception order; they cannot claim both.&lt;ref name=geist/&gt;

'''Unemployment extension''' occurs when regular [[unemployment benefits]] are exhausted and extended for additional weeks. Unemployment extensions are created by passing new [[legislation]] at the federal level, often referred to as an "unemployment extension bill."  This new legislation is introduced and passed during times of high or above average [[unemployment]] rates. Unemployment extensions are set during a date range in order to estimate their [[federal cost]].  After expiration, the unemployment data is re-evaluated, and new legislation may be proposed and passed to further extend them.

==Unemployment Extensions in The United States==
In the [[United States]], there is a standard of 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, known as "regular [[unemployment insurance]] (UI) benefits."  There are two programs for extending unemployment insurance (UI) benefits:&lt;ref name="ui1"&gt;[http://www.twc.state.tx.us/ui/bnfts/benefitextensions.pdf Texas Workforce Commission], Understanding Extended Unemployment Benefits PDF&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency Unemployment Compensation]] (EUC) and Extended Benefits (EB).

The unemployment insurance program is a great benefit for workers whom have lost their job. The maximum duration of benefits has increased from 26 to 99 weeks in some states. Unemployment extensions across the United States are a concern due to the lack of motivation in obtaining a job due to health issues. A solution to the problem would be to implement frequent processes to ensure the individual continues to stay actively applying as well as proper health routines are done. The benefits given are too long causing a lack in motivation to find a job and health issues that arise as a result of being laid off. Health issues include: anxiety, depression, joint problems, and low self-esteem. A solution to the problem would be to require routine health checkups to individuals receiving the unemployment benefits. Another solution would be to provide seminars that help motivate individuals and keep them prepared when actively applying for jobs to avoid the benefits extension that would lead to underlying health issues. Providing unemployed individuals with the proper tools and resources will help with the unemployment rate and the need for extending unemployment benefits in the United States.

EUC is a 100% federally funded program that provides benefits to individuals who have exhausted regular state benefits. The EUC program was created on June 30, 2008, and has been modified several times. Most recently, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240) extended the expiration date of the EUC program to January 1, 2014. To date, Congress has not passed any further extensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/supp_act.asp|title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) Expired on January 1, 2014, Employment &amp; Training Administration (ETA) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)===
{{prose|section|date=September 2010}}
''EUC has four levels: Tiers 1, 2, 3 and 4.''&lt;ref name="ui2"&gt;[http://www.esd.wa.gov/uibenefits/fileweekly/extension/emergency-unemployment-compensation.php Washington State Employment Dept.], Emergency Unemployment Compensation FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

EUC08, or Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008, is an extension of unemployment benefits authorized under Federal law.  The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (enacted on Feb 22, 2012) modified EUC08.&lt;ref name="ui5"&gt;[http://wdr.doleta.gov/directives/attach/UIPL/uipl_4_10_change9_acc.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 04-10, Change 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ui6"&gt;[http://www.workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/KeyDates_Table.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Key Dates for UI Programs Following Enactment of Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, P.L. 112-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Claimants who filed an initial claim effective on or after May 7, 2006 are potentially eligible for EUC08. Individuals who are monetarily ineligible when a new benefit year is filed may qualify for EUC08 on the basis of a previous claim.

* EUC Tier 1
** Provides up to 20 weeks of benefits (was 13 weeks before Nov 22, 2008)
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, reduced to 14 weeks of benefits
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust regular UI benefits
** No state unemployment rate requirements – available in every state


* EUC Tier 2
** Provides up to 14 weeks of benefits (was 13 weeks before Nov 6, 2009)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 1 benefits
** No state unemployment rate requirements – available in every state (a state high unemployment trigger was required before Nov 6, 2009)
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, requires 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 6.0%


* EUC Tier 3
** Provides up to 13 weeks of benefits 
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, reduced to 9 weeks of benefits (4 weeks moved from Tier 3 to Tier 4)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 2 benefits
** Enacted Nov 6, 2009
** Available in states with a: 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 6.0%; or 13-week insured unemployment rate (IUR) of at least 4.0%
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, TUR requirement increased to at least 7.0%; IUR requirement not changed


* EUC Tier 4
** Provides up to 6 weeks of benefits
** Between Feb 22, 2012 and May 31, 2012 increased to 16 weeks of benefits in states not receiving Extended Benefits (EB).  Claimants may have their benefits increased in certain cases:
*** Claimants receiving Tier 4 benefits on Feb 22, 2012, in states not receiving Extended Benefits on Feb 22, 2012, will be increased to 16 weeks
*** New Tier 4 claims in this period (in states not receiving Extended Benefits the week of the new claim) are entitled to 16 weeks of benefits
*** Claimants in states that transition off Extended Benefits in this period are NOT entitled to an increase; their claim start week (compared to their state's EB status) determines whether they are entitled to 6 or 16 weeks of benefits.
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, 16 weeks of benefits reduced to 6 weeks (EB test removed)
** Starting Sep 2, 2012, increased to 10 weeks of benefits (4 weeks moved from Tier 3 to Tier 4)
** Eligible to claimants who exhaust EUC Tier 3 benefits
** Available in states with a: 3-month seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate (TUR) of at least 8.5%; or 13-week insured unemployment rate (IUR) of at least 6.0%
** Starting Jun 1, 2012, TUR requirement increased to at least 9.0%; IUR requirement not changed

===Extended Benefits (EB)===
Extended Benefits are available to workers who have exhausted regular unemployment insurance benefits during periods of high [[unemployment]]. The basic Extended Benefits program provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits when a State is experiencing high unemployment. Some States have also enacted a voluntary program to pay up to 7 additional weeks (20 weeks maximum) of Extended Benefits during periods of extremely high unemployment.&lt;ref name="ui4"&gt;[http://ows.doleta.gov/unemploy/extenben.asp U.S. Dept. of Labor], Unemployment Insurance Extended Benefits&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reachback==
In addition to individuals who exhausted all rights to benefits after the original date of enactment, the [[#Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC)|EUC]] law includes what is commonly referred to as a [[reachback provision]]. A reachback provision makes eligible those individuals who exhausted all rights to benefits prior to the original date of enactment (back to a specified date). The EUC law makes eligible all individuals whose benefit year ending date is on or after May 1, 2007. Practically speaking, this means some individuals receiving EUC may have become unemployed as early as May 2006.&lt;ref name="ui3"&gt;[http://ows.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf U.S. Dept. of Labor], Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) Program PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc.''''', 342 U.S. 371 (1952),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc.|volume=342|page=371|year=1952}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1952 [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in which the Court held that a claim of conspiracy to fix uniform minimum prices and to eliminate competition throughout substantially all of the wrinkle finish industry of the United States by means of patent license agreements was, if proved, a violation of §&amp;nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act. That one of the defendants, a patent-holding company, abstained from manufacturing activities, did not ship goods in commerce, and engaged solely in patent licensing did not insulate its activity from §&amp;nbsp;1. Making these license contracts for the purpose of regulating distribution and fixing prices of commodities in interstate commerce is subject to the Sherman Act, even though the isolated act of contracting for the licenses occurs within a single state. Patents give no protection from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act when the patent licensing agreements are used to restrain interstate commerce and fix prices of goods shipped in commerce.

==Background==

Before and during 1937, two paint companies, Kay &amp; Ess and Chadeloid Chemical Co., were in patent litigation with each other. Each company claimed that it controlled the basic patents on wrinkle finish,&lt;ref&gt;Wrinkle–finish enamels, varnishes, and paints are manufactured in a manner such that, when they are applied to metal or another material and allowed to dry, they form a hard, wrinkled surface on the metal or other material. The patents cover methods and chemicals for making such enamels, varnishes and paints. 342 U.S. at 372 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and each company contended that the patents of the other could not be used without infringing its own patents. In November 1937 they decided to settle the litigation by forming a new, jointly–owned company, New Wrinkle, to which they assigned their patents. They agreed that they would license the wrinkle–finish industry to make and sell at fixed prices. Kay &amp; Ess and Chadeloid then worked together to induce all manufacturers of wrinkle finish products to accept the price-fixing patent licenses from New Wrinkle. The prospective licensees were assured that the other manufacturers were being dealt with on the same basis "in order to establish minimum prices throughout the industry." By September 1938 the leading manufacturing companies and some 200 other manufacturers—substantially all manufacturers of wrinkle finishes in the United States—held nearly identical ten-year extendable license agreements from New Wrinkle, fixing prices. These license agreements required that a licensee observe in all sales of products covered by the licensed patents a schedule of minimum prices, discounts, and selling terms. Unlike its organizers, Kay &amp; Ess and Chadeloid, New Wrinkle does not manufacture and sell the patented products. It just owns and licenses the patents.&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 373–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States sued Kay &amp; Ess, Chadeloid, and New Wrinkle in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, for conspiring to fix uniform minimum prices and to eliminate competition throughout the wrinkle–finish industry, in violation of §&amp;nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act. The defendants filed motions to dismiss, which the district court granted without issuing any opinion. The United States appealed to the Supreme Court.

==Ruling of the Supreme Court==

[[File:Stanley Forman Reed (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200ps|Justice Reed delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court]]

Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]] delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Justice [[Tom C. Clark]], who had been Attorney General when the case was filed, recused himself.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because New Wrinkle, unlike Kay &amp; Ess and Chadeloid, did not manufacture or sell the patented products, and just owned and licensed the pooled patents, New Wrinkle contended that it is not engaged in trade or commerce—and thus could not be held liable for restraining trade and commerce under §&amp;nbsp;1 of the Sherman Act. "These contentions leave out of consideration," the Court responded, the allegations that "the use of patent licenses as an essential part of the plan to restrain trade, a trade in enamels, varnishes, and paints that is alleged to be and obviously is interstate in character." Pointing to the price-fixing provisions of the licenses, the Court said that it is "beyond question that this making of license contracts for the purpose of regulating distribution and fixing prices of commodities in interstate commerce is subject to the Sherman Act, even though the isolated act of contracting for the licenses is wholly within a single state."&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Wrinkle next argued that the doctrine of ''[[United States v. General Electric Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. General Electric Co.|link=|volume=272|page=476|pin=|year=1926}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—the ''1926 GE case''—immunized the price fixing from the antitrust laws. The Court distinguished the ''GE'' case from the case at bar: In the ''GE'' case, a patentee licensed a single other manufacturer to make and sell the patented product with a price limitation controlled by the patentee. In the present case, a patentee, acting in concert with all members of an industry, issued substantially identical licenses to all members of the industry under the terms of which the industry is completely regimented in order to organize the industry and stabilize prices. The Court said the case was indistinguishable from ''[[United States v. Line Material Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Line Material Co.|link=|volume=333|page=287|pin=|year=1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[United States v. United States Gypsum Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. United States Gypsum Co.|link=|volume=333|page=364|pin=|year=1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which held such conduct illegal.&lt;ref&gt;342 U.S. at 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Newburgh Moire Co. v. Superior Moire Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Newburgh Moire Co. v. Superior Moire Co. |vol=237 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=283 |pinpoint= |court=[[3d Cir.]] |date=1956 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/237/283/120310/ |accessdate=2018-07-06  |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Third Circuit held that price-fixing clauses in multiple patent licenses violated the Sherman Act. Newburgh entered into licensing agreements with three of the five manufacturers in the moire finish industry, containing price-fixing clauses. The court held that the fact that there was more than one price-fixing license (in contrast to the single such license in the ''General Electric'' case) made the licenses fall outside the range of protected behavior that the ''General Electric'' case allowed. The Third Circuit explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At worst, we think that the patent laws were not intended to empower a patentee to grant a plurality of licenses, each containing provisions fixing the price at which the licensee might sell the product or process .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and that, if a plurality of licenses are granted, such provisions therein are prohibited by the antitrust laws. The course pursued by Newburgh in the case at bar transcends the authority of the ''General Electric'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 293-94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the differences in the fact patterns (multiple licenses, pooling, cross-licensing), the court said it saw no difference between the ''General Electric'' and ''New Wrinkle'' cases, so that the latter must be regarded as overruling the former: "We can find no very strong basis for distinguishing between ''General Electric'' and ''New Wrinkle''. The explanation probably lies more in history than in logic, for history is an untidy housekeeper."&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 293&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Warner Van Alstyne'''  is an [[Law of the United States|American lawyer]], [[law professor]], and [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]] [[scholar]]. Prior to retiring in 2012, he held the [[Professor|named position]] of Lee Professor of Law at [[William and Mary Law School]]. He was the Perkins Professor of Law at Duke Law School for more than 30 years and has taught at Chicago Law School; Stanford Law School; University of California, Berkeley, Law School, University of California, Los Angeles, Law School; Michigan Law School, among many others.

Van Alstyne received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in [[philosophy]] ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]'' from the [[University of Southern California]]. He received his [[Juris Doctor]] [[law degree]] from [[Stanford Law School]]. Following his admission to the California Bar and brief service as Deputy Attorney General of California, he joined the Civil Rights Division of the U. S. Department of Justice handling voting rights cases in the South. After active duty with the U. S. Air Force, he was appointed to the law faculty of the Ohio State University, advancing to full professor in three years. Professor Van Alstyne was named to Duke's William R. and Thomas S. Perkins Chair of Law in 1974.   He holds a certificate from The Hague Academy of International Law and has been honored with LL.D. degrees by Wake Forest University and the College of William &amp; Mary.&lt;ref&gt;https://law.duke.edu/fac/vanalstyne/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Professor Van Alstyne was selected in a poll of federal judges, lawyers, and academics by the New York Law Journal as one of three academics among "the 10 most qualified" persons in the country for appointment to the Supreme Court, a distinction repeated in a similar poll by The American Lawyer, in 1991. Past National President of the American Association of University Professors, and former member of the National Board of Directors of the A.C.L.U., he was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994.

Van Alstyne's body of work includes many books, [[law journal]] articles, and [[United States Congressional committee|congressional committee]] testimony. In 1994, he was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. An article in the January 2000 ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies|Journal of Legal Studies]]'' found that Van Alstyne was among the top 40 legal scholars in the United States in number of academic [[citation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Fred R. "The Most-Cited Legal Scholars." Journal of Legal Studies 29.1 (Jan. 2000): 409-426. 14 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His work has also been cited by courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States. In 2012, in a study published by the University of Michigan Law Review, by Fred Shapiro and Michelle Pearse, "The Most Cited Law Review Article of All Time," Van Alstyne's  "The Demise of the Right-Privilege Distinction in Constittional Law," 81 HARV. L. REV. 1439 (1968) was included at number 35. http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&amp;context=mlr.

He has testified numerous times before Congress on numerous Constitutional issues. His testimony on the impeachment of President William Jefferson Clinton was quoted with approval by the New York Times opinion page. "This point [to strike a balance] was underscored by one of the Republican witnesses, Prof. William Van Alstyne of Duke University Law School. It is ''the prerogative of this Congress,'' he observed, ''to express dismay, despair and condemnation'' by means short of impeachment. Mindful of the likelihood that impeachment will fail, he urged lawmakers to ''struggle to find a suitable means to express your sense of disappointment.''

That neatly defines the challenge now confronting the members of Congress. There is nothing in the Constitution to keep them from rising to that task." https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/11/opinion/constitutional-room-for-censure.html

A '''youth advocate''' is an adult who acts in the best interests of the youth that they are working with.  The overall purpose of a youth advocate is to ensure that youth maintain their [[human rights]] while aiding in skill development in all areas of life such as education, health, housing, employment, relationships, etc.  A youth advocate aims to prevent youth from experiencing diminished self-esteem while interacting with adults who hold professional authoritative roles in their life.  Examples of these adults are judges, lawyers, teachers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/proceedings/09/finlayson.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Travis Lloyd]], a speaker on the subject, describes a youth advocate as one who plays a significant supportive role in the social and legal processes in the lives of young people, especially homeless and foster youth who lack family support.  In consideration of the legal aspects, the National Association of Youth Courts describes a youth advocate as a person who provides support to a youth respondent or defendant during a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthcourt.net/content/view/11/23/1/18/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006181903/http://www.youthcourt.net/content/view/11/23/1/18/ |archivedate=October 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
