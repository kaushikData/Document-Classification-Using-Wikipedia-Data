'''AS-International''' is the [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] [[trade association]] for [[AS-Interface]] ([[Actuator]]/[[Sensor]]-Interface, short: AS-i) users worldwide.

AS-International is the sole owner of the [[trademark|''registered trademark'']] ''[[AS-Interface]]'', and only members may develop and sell products using ''[[AS-Interface]]'' technology. The association also controls the ''[[certification]]'' process, and grants the right to use the AS-Interface logo on printed and electronic material as well as the products themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.openautomation.de/1806-0-as-international-bestaetigt-akkreditierung-zweier-prueflabore.html| title=AS-Interface bestaetigt Akkreditierung zweier Pruefungslabore | date=2010-08-23 |publisher= OpenAutomation.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; AS-International represents a worldwide community of approximately 350 members. At this time, in addition to the headquarters in ''[[Gelnhausen]]'', Germany, 13 independently structured local organizations on three continents exist.

== History ==
In 1990, eleven German ([http://www.balluff.com Balluff], [http://www.festo.com Festo], [http://www.ifm.com ifm electronic], [http://www.leuzeusa.com Leuze electronic], [http://pepperl-fuchs.us Pepperl+Fuchs], [http://www.sick.com Sick], [http://www.siemens.com Siemens], [http://www.turck.com Turck],  Visolux (now part of the Pepperl+Fuchs group) and Swiss ([http://www.baumer.com Baumer], and [http://www.elestarelays.com Elesta]) companies conceived a [[system bus|''bus system'']] for networking ''[[sensors]]'' and ''[[actuators]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.sps-magazin.de/?inc=artikel/article_show&amp;nr=71886 | title=Einfach – sicher – international | date=2012-11-09 |author= Kai Binder |publisher= SPS Magazin}}&lt;/ref&gt; These industrial companies, with different strategic and economic interests, and frequently competing, jointly conceived the AS-Interface technology. Funded in part by the ''[[BMBF]]'' (formerly BMFT- German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology,) their goal was the development of a simple and low-cost system. In 1991, after the completion of this work, an independent, [[nonprofit organization|''nonprofit'']] user organization, the ''Association for Promotion of Bus-compatible Interfaces e.V.'', now doing business as AS-International e.V., was founded. This was necessary to address legislation concerning [[anti-competitive practices|''anti-competitive business practices'']]. The developing companies effectively relinquished their rights in the core technology. Consequently and as stated in its constitution, AS-International is the owner and guardian of the ''[[trademark]]'' AS-Interface®, and owns the rights and the ''[[specification]]'' to the ''[[AS-Interface]]'' technology. Therefore, any company producing technology with ''[[AS-Interface]]'' products is required to be a member of AS-International Association. Additionally, the organization represents the technology in international regulatory bodies, organizes and hosts educational seminars, and promotes advancements of the technology. According to AS-International, the organization's mission is ''the promotion of bus-able interfaces for sensors and actuators.''

In the fall of 1991, the detailed ''[[specification]]'' was approved, allowing AS-International members to start developing [[master/slave (technology)|''slave'']] components.

By mid 1992, the [[electromechanics|''electro-mechanical'']] ''[[specification]]'' was released, defining the AS-Interface flat-cable, an essential component to addressing the goal of simple network installations.

Mid 1992, the [[master/slave (technology)|''master'']] ''[[specification]]'' was released, resulting in the development of a number of bus masters with and without interfaces to other higher-level ‘’[[fieldbus]]’’ solutions.

In the fall of 1993, the first ''[[application-specific integrated circuit]]'' (ASIC) became available, simplifying [[master/slave (technology)|''slave'']]  development and passing performance testing.

In early 1994, the first fully functional circuit and [[prototype|''prototypes'']] became available.

Mid 1994, FZI ([[Forschungszentrum Informatik]]) in Karlsruhe – research institute for computer science in Karlsruhe) developed the first systems with [[master/slave (technology)|''master'']].

In 1999, AS-Interface is standardized in EN 50295 and IEC 62026-2 (revised in 2012.)

In 2010, AS-International introduced AS-Interface Power 24V, enabling the use of almost any 24V power supply for AS-Interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.sps-magazin.de/?inc=artikel/article_show&amp;nr=46175 | title=AS-Interface erschliesst neue Anwendungen | date=2009-09-09 | author= Rolf Becker |publisher= SPS Magazin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.sps-magazin.de/?inc=artikel/article_show&amp;nr=53882 | title=AS-I Power 24V | date=2010-04-08 | author= Kai Binder |publisher= SPS Magazin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, the Developer Kit for AS-Interface to create a fully functional as-Interface network was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.automationworld.com/information-management/interface-developer-kit| title=AS-Interface Developer Kit |date=2012-07-23 |author= Gary Mintchell |publisher= Automation World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Boy and His Atom''''' is a 2013 [[stop-motion animation|stop-motion animated]] short film released on [[YouTube]] by [[IBM Research]]. The movie tells the story of a boy and a wayward atom who meet and become friends. It depicts a boy playing with an atom that takes various forms. One minute in length, it was made by moving [[carbon monoxide]] [[molecule]]s with a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], a device that magnifies them 100 million times. These two-atom molecules were moved to create images, which were then saved as individual frames to make the film.&lt;ref name="IBM Research"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Boy And His Atom |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/madewithatoms.shtml |website=IBM Research |accessdate=December 29, 2015 |date=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie has been recognized by the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the World's Smallest Stop-Motion Film.

The scientists at IBM Research – [[IBM Almaden Research Center|Almaden]] who made the film are moving atoms to explore the limits of data storage because, as data creation and consumption gets bigger, data storage needs to get smaller, all the way down to the atomic level. Traditional silicon transistor technology has become cheaper, denser and more efficient, but fundamental physical limitations suggest that scaling down is an unsustainable path to solving the growing Big Data dilemma. This team of scientists is particularly interested in starting on the smallest scale, single atoms, and building structures up from there. Using this method, IBM announced it can now store a single bit of information in just 12 atoms (current technology takes roughly one million atoms to store a single bit).&lt;ref name="IBM Research" /&gt;

==Synopsis==

At the beginning of the film, subtitles introduce the audience to how and why the film was made. When the action starts, we see a boy meeting an atom. Hesitant at first, he dances for it to the film's musical accompaniment, then bounces it around like a ball. The atom drops to the ground and forms a trampoline, which the boy bounces on. The atom reforms, and the boy tosses it into the sky, flying past clouds and the word "[[Think (IBM)|Think]]", a longtime internal IBM motto.&lt;ref name=DailyTech /&gt;

==Creation==
[[File:Carbon-monoxide-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|Diagram of a carbon monoxide molecule|alt=A large black spherical object with a slightly smaller red one merging into it from the right]]
''A Boy And His Atom'' was created by a team of [[IBM]] scientists – together with [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], IBM's longstanding advertising agency – at the company's [[IBM Almaden Research Center|Almaden Research Center]] in [[San Jose, California]].&lt;ref name="Moving Atoms"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Moving Atoms: Making the World's Smallest Movie |medium=Digital video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4QWwaweWA |accessdate=May 4, 2013|time=2:35–3:00 |publisher=[[IBM Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a [[scanning tunneling microscope]], [[Carbon monoxide]] molecules were manipulated into place on a copper [[substrate (electronics)|substrate]] with a copper needle at a distance of 1 nanometer.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; They remain in place, forming a bond with the substrate because of the extremely low temperature of 5 K ({{convert|5|K|C|disp=output only}}, {{convert|5|K|F|disp=output only}}) at which the device operates.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |last=Palmer |first=Jason |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22364761|title=Atoms star in world's smallest movie |publisher=BBC |date=May 1, 2013 |accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[oxygen]] component of each molecule shows up as a dot when photographed by the scanning tunneling microscope, allowing the creation of images composed of many such dots.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt;

The team created 242 still images with 65 carbon monoxide molecules. The images were combined to make a stop-motion film.&lt;ref name=DailyTech&gt;{{cite news |last=Mick |first=Jason |title=IBM Makes World's Smallest Movie Using Deadly Carbon Monoxide |work=Daily Tech |date=May 1, 2013 |url=http://www.dailytech.com/IBM+Makes+Worlds+Smallest+Movie+Using+Deadly+Carbon+Monoxide/article31458.htm |accessdate=May 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071121/http://www.dailytech.com/IBM+Makes+Worlds+Smallest+Movie+Using+Deadly+Carbon+Monoxide/article31458.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each frame measures 45 by 25 [[nanometer]]s.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news |title=IBM makes movie about a little boy _ a very little boy _ by pushing molecules around |agency=Associated Press |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=May 1, 2013 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/ibm-makes-movie-about-a-little-boy-_-a-very-little-boy-_-by-pushing-molecules-around/2013/05/01/d9472050-b214-11e2-9fb1-62de9581c946_story.html |accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took four researchers two weeks of 18-hour days to produce the film.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

The graphics and sound effects resemble those of early video games. "This movie is a fun way to share the atomic-scale world," said project leader [[Andreas J. Heinrich]]. "The reason we made this was not to convey a scientific message directly, but to engage with students, to prompt them to ask questions."&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; In addition, the researchers created three still images to promote ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]''—the [[Federation (Star Trek)|Federation]] logo, the starship ''[[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', and a [[Vulcan salute]].&lt;ref name=DailyTech /&gt;

==Reaction==
[[Guinness World Records]] certified the movie as The World's Smallest Stop-Motion Film ever made.&lt;ref name=AP /&gt; The film was accepted into the Tribeca Online Film Festival and shown at the New York Tech Meet-up and the World Science Festival. Now in the top 1% of all most-watched YouTube videos, the film surpassed a million views in 24 hours, and two million views in 48 hours, with more than 27,000 likes.

==Implications==
While the film was used by the researchers as a fun way to get students interested in science, it grew out of work that could increase the amount of data computers could store. In 2012 they had demonstrated that they could store a [[bit]] of computer memory on a group of just 12 atoms instead of a million, the previous minimum.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; If it became commercially viable, "You could carry around, not just two movies on your [[iPhone]]," Heinrich said in a companion video about the film's production, "you could carry around every movie ever produced."&lt;ref name="Moving Atoms at 2:35"&gt;''Moving Atoms'', at 2:55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Artery/Tunnel Project''' ('''CA/T'''), known unofficially as the '''Big Dig''', was a [[megaproject]] in [[Boston]] that rerouted the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway|Central Artery]] of [[Interstate 93]], the chief [[highway]] through the heart of the city, into the 1.5-mile (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]]. The project also included the construction of the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]] (extending [[Interstate 90]] to [[Logan International Airport]]), the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Charles River]], and the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]] in the space vacated by the previous I-93 elevated roadway. Initially, the plan was also to include a [[North–South Rail Link|rail connection]] between Boston's two major train terminals. Planning began in 1982; the construction work was carried out between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on December 31, 2007 when the partnership between the program manager and the [[Massachusetts Turnpike Authority]] ended.&lt;ref name="enddate"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Steve |last= LeBlanc |title= On December 31, It's Official: Boston's Big Dig Will Be Done |work= The Washington Post |date=2007-12-26 |accessdate= 2007-12-26 |url= http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/25/AR2007122500600.html?nav=hcmoduletmv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
[[Image:OnBostonsElevatedCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Traffic on the old, elevated Central Artery at mid-day in 2003]]
This project was developed in response to traffic congestion on Boston's historically tangled streets which were laid out long before the advent of the [[automobile]]. As early as 1930 the city's Planning Board recommended a raised express highway running north-south through the [[Downtown Boston|downtown]] district in order to draw traffic off the city streets.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Boston Globe, December 21, 1930 'Streets In The Air Only Solution To Boston's Traffic Problems So Says the Planning Board That Asks for Two-Level Road Across City, Costing $28,000,000, as First Item in a Big Scheme'&lt;/ref&gt; Commissioner of Public Works [[William F. Callahan|William Callahan]] promoted plans for an elevated expressway which eventually was constructed between the downtown area and the waterfront. Governor [[John Volpe]] interceded in the 1950s to change the design of the last section of the Central Artery putting it underground through the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. While traffic moved somewhat better, the other problems remained. There was chronic congestion on the Central Artery (I-93), an elevated six-lane highway through the center of downtown Boston, which was, in the words of Pete Sigmund, "like a funnel full of slowly-moving, or stopped, cars (and swearing motorists)."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{Cite news |first=Pete |last=Sigmund |url=http://cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&amp;headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project |title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project |publisher=Construction Equipment Guide |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2007-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1959, the 1.5-mile-long (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) road section carried approximately 75,000 vehicles a day, but by the 1990s, this had grown to 190,000 vehicles a day. Traffic jams of 16 hours were predicted for 2010.&lt;ref name="MTA"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/bigdig/projectbkg.aspx |title=The Big Dig - Project Background |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |accessdate=2009-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213200252/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/bigdig/projectbkg.aspx |archivedate=13 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expressway had tight turns, an excessive number of entrances and exits, entrance ramps without merge lanes, and as the decades passed, had continually escalating vehicular traffic that was well beyond its design capacity. Local businesses again wanted relief, city leaders sought a reuniting of the waterfront with the city, and nearby residents desired removal of the matte green-painted elevated road which mayor [[Thomas Menino]] called Boston's "other [[Green Monster]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| agency=Associated Press | url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3769829 | title=Boston’s ‘Big Dig’ opens to public | publisher=MSNBC | date=December 20, 2003 | accessdate=2006-07-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060821233345/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3769829| archivedate= 21 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] engineers Bill Reynolds and (eventual state Secretary of Transportation) [[Frederick P. Salvucci]] envisioned moving the whole expressway underground.

===Cancellation of the Inner Belt project===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Another important motivation for the final form of the Big Dig was the abandonment of the Massachusetts Department of Public Works' intended expressway system through and around Boston. The Central Artery, as part of Mass. DPW's Master Plan of 1948, was originally planned to be the downtown Boston stretch of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and was signed as such; a bypass road called the Inner Belt, was subsequently renamed  [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]]. (The law establishing the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956|Interstate highway system]] was enacted in 1956.)  The [[Inner Belt District]] was to pass to the west of the downtown core, through the neighborhood of [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] and the cities of [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]. Earlier controversies over impact of the Boston extension of the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], particularly on the heavily populated neighborhood of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], and the additional large amount of housing that would have had to be destroyed led to [[freeway and expressway revolts|massive community opposition]] to both the Inner Belt and the Boston section of I-95.

Building demolition and land clearances for I-95 through the neighborhoods of Roxbury, [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[Roslindale]] led to secession threats by [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]], Boston's youngest and southernmost neighborhood. By 1972, with only a minimum of work done on the I-95 right of way and none on the potentially massively disruptive Inner Belt, Governor [[Francis Sargent]] put a moratorium on highway construction within the [[Massachusetts Route 128|MA-128]] corridor, except for the final short stretch of Interstate 93. In 1974, the remainder of the Master Plan was canceled, leaving Boston with a severely overstressed expressway system for the existing traffic.

With ever-increasing traffic volumes funneled onto I-93 alone, the Central Artery became chronically gridlocked. The Sargent moratorium led to the rerouting of I-95 away from Boston around the MA-128 beltway and the conversion of the cleared land in the southern part of the city into the [[Southwest Corridor Park|Southwest Corridor linear park]], as well as a new right-of-way for the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] subway and [[Amtrak]]. Parts of the planned I-695 right-of-way remain unused and under consideration for future mass-transit projects.

The original 1948 Master Plan included a Third Harbor Tunnel plan that was hugely controversial in its own right, because it would have disrupted the [[Maverick Square]] area of [[East Boston]]. It was never built.

===Mixing of traffic===
A major reason for the all-day congestion was that the Central Artery carried not only north–south traffic, but much east–west traffic as well. Boston's Logan Airport lies across [[Boston Harbor]] in East Boston, and before the Big Dig the only access from downtown was through the paired [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] and [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] tunnels. Traffic on the major highways from west of Boston—the Massachusetts Turnpike and [[Storrow Drive]]—mostly traveled on portions of the Central Artery to reach these tunnels. Getting between the Central Artery and the tunnels involved short diversions onto city streets, increasing local congestion.

===Mass transit===
A number of [[public transportation]] projects were included as part of an [[environmental mitigation]] for the Big Dig. The most expensive was the building of the Phase II [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] tunnel under [[Fort Point Channel]], done in coordination with Big Dig construction. Silver Line buses now use this tunnel and the Ted Williams Tunnel to link [[South Station]] and Logan Airport.

{{As of|2015}}, promised projects to extend the Green Line beyond [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]], to connect the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue]] subway lines, and to restore the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] streetcar service to the [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] in [[Jamaica Plain]] have not been completed. Construction of the [[Green Line Extension|extension beyond Lechmere]] has begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenlineextension.org/ |title=Green Line Extension Project |publisher=Greenlineextension.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301005210/http://www.greenlineextension.org/ |archivedate=2014-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red and Blue subway line connection underwent initial design,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eot.state.ma.us/redblue/ Red Line / Blue Line Connector]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105024145/http://www.eot.state.ma.us/redblue/ |date=January 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no funding has been designated for the project. The [[Green Line "E" Branch|Arborway Line restoration]] has been abandoned, following a final court decision in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://jamaicaplaingazette.com/2011/08/26/trolley-comeback-killed-by-court/ |title=Trolley comeback killed by court |newspaper=Jamaica Plain Gazette |author=Ruch, John |date=26 August 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229004250/http://jamaicaplaingazette.com/2011/08/26/trolley-comeback-killed-by-court/ |archivedate=29 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Big Dig plan also included the [[North-South Rail Link]], which would have connected North and South Stations (the major passenger train stations in Boston), but this aspect of the project was ultimately dropped by the state transportation administration early in the [[Michael Dukakis|Dukakis]] administration. Negotiations with the federal government had led to an agreement to widen some of the lanes in the new harbor tunnel, and accommodating these would require the tunnel to be deeper and mechanically-vented; this left no room for the rail lines, and having diesel trains (then in use) passing through the tunnel would have substantially increased the cost of the ventilation system.&lt;ref name="Haglund2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haglund|first1=Charles|title=Inventing the Charles River|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262083078|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early planning==
The project was conceived in the 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery. The expressway separated downtown from the waterfront, and was increasingly choked with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Business leaders were more concerned about access to [[Logan Airport]], and pushed instead for a third harbor tunnel. In their second terms, [[Michael Dukakis]] (governor) and [[Fred Salvucci]] (secretary of transportation) came up with the strategy of tying the two projects together—thereby combining the project that the business community supported with the project that they and the City of Boston supported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Planning for the Big Dig as a project officially began in 1982, with environmental impact studies starting in 1983. After years of extensive lobbying for federal dollars, a 1987 public works bill appropriating funding for the Big Dig was passed by the [[Congress of the United States|US Congress]], but it was vetoed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] for being too expensive. When Congress [[Veto override|overrode]] the veto, the project had its green light and ground was first broken in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Dan McNichol and Andy Ryan, ''The Big Dig''. Silver Lining Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the state legislature created the Metropolitan Highway System and transferred responsibility for the Central Artery and Tunnel "CA/T" Project from the Massachusetts Highway Department and the Massachusetts Governor's Office to the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority (MTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cerasoli charges Big Dig coverup|first=Thomas C.|last=Palmer Jr.|authorlink2=|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/metro/packages/bechtel/archives/032101.htm|newspaper=Boston Globe|isbn=|issn=|oclc=|pmid=|pmd=|bibcode=|id=|date=March 21, 2001|at=|accessdate=September 3, 2011|trans-title=|quote=Big Dig managers in the William F.

The MTA, which had little experience in managing an undertaking of the scope and magnitude of the CA/T Project, hired a joint venture to provide preliminary designs, manage design consultants and construction contractors, track the project's cost and schedule, advise MTA on project decisions, and (in some instances) act as the MTA's representative. Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.&lt;ref&gt;OIG Testimony CC-2005-027, "Impact of Water Leaks on the Central Artery/Tunnel Project and Remaining Risks"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obstacles==
In addition to political and financial difficulties, the project faced several environmental and engineering obstacles.
The downtown area through which the tunnels were to be dug was largely [[Land reclamation|landfill]], and included existing [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] and [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]  [[rapid transit|subway]] tunnels as well as innumerable pipes and utility lines that would have to be replaced or moved. Tunnel workers encountered many unexpected geological and archaeological barriers, ranging from glacial debris to foundations of buried houses and a number of sunken ships lying within the reclaimed land.

The project received approval from state environmental agencies in 1991, after satisfying concerns including release of toxins by the excavation and the possibility of disrupting the homes of millions of [[rat]]s, causing them to roam the streets of Boston in search of new housing. By the time the federal environmental clearances were delivered in 1994,&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Thomas |last=Palmer |url=http://libraries.mit.edu/rotch/artery/boston_globe.htm#wins |title=State Wins Federal OK to Start River-Crossing Part of Artery Project |work=Boston Globe |date=1994-06-21 |accessdate=2007-12-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105064639/http://libraries.mit.edu/rotch/artery/boston_globe.htm#wins |archivedate=2007-11-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the process had taken some seven years, during which time inflation greatly increased the project's original cost estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes|first=Wendy|date=June 2008|title=Boston’s Big Dig Project: A Cautionary Tale|url=http://paperity.org/p/81488266/bridgewater-review-vol-27-no-1-june-2008|journal=Bridgewater Review, Vol. 27, No. 1|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3-7|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317035739/http://paperity.org/p/81488266/bridgewater-review-vol-27-no-1-june-2008|archivedate=2018-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reworking such a busy corridor without seriously restricting traffic flow required a number of state-of-the-art construction techniques. Because the old elevated highway (which remained in operation throughout the construction process) rested on pylons located throughout the designated dig area, engineers first utilized [[slurry wall]] techniques to create {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} concrete walls upon which the highway could rest. These concrete walls also stabilized the sides of the site, preventing cave-ins during the continued excavation process.

The multi-lane interstate highway also had to pass under [[South Station (MBTA)|South Station]]'s seven railway tracks, which carried over 40,000 commuters and 400 trains per day. To avoid multiple relocations of train lines while the tunneling advanced, as had been initially planned, a specially designed [[jack (device)|jack]] was constructed to support the ground and tracks to allow the excavation to take place below. Construction crews also used [[ground freezing]] (an artificial induction of [[permafrost]]) to help stabilize surrounding ground as they excavated the tunnel. This was the largest tunneling project undertaken beneath railway lines anywhere in the world. The ground freezing enabled safer, more efficient [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]], and also assisted in environmental issues, as less contaminated fill needed to be exported than if a traditional [[Cut-and-cover tunnel|cut-and-cover method]] had been applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;amp;id=3418 |title=Boston Central Artery Jacked Tunnels - Mott MacDonald Project Page |publisher=Tunnels.mottmac.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408221143/https://tunnels.mottmac.com/projects/?mode=region&amp;amp;id=3418 |archivedate=2014-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other challenges included existing subway tunnels crossing the path of the underground highway. To build slurry walls past these tunnels, it was necessary to dig beneath the tunnels and to build an underground concrete bridge to support the tunnels' weight, without interrupting rail service.

The project was managed by the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, with the Big Dig and the Turnpike's Boston Extension from the 1960s being financially and legally joined by the legislature as the [[Metropolitan Highway System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |title=MGL Chapter 81A, Section 3 |publisher=Mass.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726222848/http://www.mass.gov//legis/laws/mgl/81a-3.htm |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Design and construction was supervised by a joint venture of [[Bechtel Corporation]] and [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]]. Because of the enormous size of the project—too large for any company to undertake alone—the design and construction of the Big Dig was broken up into dozens of smaller subprojects with well-defined interfaces between contractors. Major heavy-construction contractors on the project included [[Jay Cashman]], [[Modern Continental]], [[Obayashi Corporation]], [[Perini Building Company|Perini Corporation]], [[Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated]], [[J. F. White Contracting Co.|J. F. White]], and the Slattery division of [[Skanska]] USA. (Of those, Modern Continental was awarded the greatest gross value of contracts, joint ventures included.)

The nature of the [[Charles River]] crossing had been a source of major controversy throughout the design phase of the project. Many environmental advocates preferred a river crossing entirely in tunnels, but this, along with 27 other plans, was rejected as too costly. Finally, with a deadline looming to begin construction on a separate project that would connect the [[Tobin Bridge]] to the Charles River crossing, Salvucci overrode the objections and chose a variant of the plan known as "Scheme Z". This plan was considered to be reasonably cost-effective, but had the drawback of requiring highway ramps stacked up as high as {{convert|100|ft|m}} immediately adjacent to the Charles River.&lt;ref name="bg-scheme z"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Caution: High bridge ahead; Artery plan includes an awful scheme for a great wall across the Charles |last=Campbell |first=Robert |date=June 24, 1990 |work= Boston Globe |id= Accessed 2009-08-04 |quote= The grotesque monstrosity that will be the new Central Artery requires a certain power of imagination to be grasped. Maybe that's why people are only now beginning to get upset about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] objected to the visual impact of the chosen Charles River crossing design. The city sued to revoke the project's environmental certificate and forced the project planners to redesign the river crossing again.&lt;ref name="bg-cambridge"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Cambridge sues to halt bridge plan |last=Palmer Jr |first=Thomas C. |date= March 12, 1995 |work= Boston Globe |id= Accessed 2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ZakimBridge20040307.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Leonard P. Zakim Bridge]]
Swiss engineer [[Christian Menn]] took over the design of the bridge. He suggested a cradle [[cable-stayed bridge]] that would carry ten lanes of traffic. The plan was accepted and construction began on the [[Leonard P. Zakim Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge]]. The bridge employed an asymmetrical design and a hybrid of steel and concrete was used to construct it. The distinctive bridge is supported by two forked towers connected to the span by cables and girders. It was the first bridge in the country to employ this method and it was, at the time, the widest cable-stayed bridge in the world,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news | first=Pete | last=Sigmund | url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=8751&amp;headline=Triumph,%20Tragedy%20Mark%20Boston%E2%80%99s%20Big%20Dig%20Project | title=Triumph, Tragedy Mark Boston's Big Dig Project | publisher=Construction Equipment Guide | date=2007-06-06 | accessdate=2007-12-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; having since been surpassed by the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]], although that structure is actually a self-anchored suspension bridge, not a cable-stayed bridge.

Meanwhile, construction continued on the Tobin Bridge approach. By the time all parties agreed on the I-93 design, construction of the Tobin connector (today known as the "City Square Tunnel" for a [[Charlestown, Boston, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] area it bypasses) was far along, significantly adding to the cost of constructing the [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US Route 1]] interchange and retrofitting the tunnel. &lt;!--Shift to active voice shortened this sentence a little, but it's still unclear whether the Rt1 work and tunnel retrofit were built, or were abandoned because of the increased cost.--&gt;

Boston blue [[clay]] and other soils extracted from the path of the tunnel were used to cap many local [[landfill]]s, fill in the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|Granite Rail Quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], and restore the surface of [[Spectacle Island (Massachusetts)|Spectacle Island]] in the [[Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area]].

The [[Storrow Drive Connector]], a companion bridge to the Zakim, began carrying traffic from I-93 to [[Storrow Drive]] in 1999. The project had been under consideration for years, but was opposed by the wealthy residents of the [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]] neighborhood. However, it finally was accepted because it would funnel traffic bound for Storrow Drive and downtown Boston away from the mainline roadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/ | title=Leonard P. Zakim-Bunker Hill Memorial Bridge | accessdate=2006-07-18 | publisher=BostonRoads.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060626115922/http://www.bostonroads.com/crossings/zakim/| archivedate= 26 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connector ultimately used a pair of ramps that had been constructed for [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 695]], enabling the mainline I-93 to carry more traffic that would have used I-695 under the original Master Plan.

When construction began, the project cost, including the Charles River crossing, was estimated at $5.8 billion. Eventual [[cost overruns]] were so high that the chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, [[James Kerasiotes]], was fired in 2000. His replacement had to commit to an $8.55 billion cap on federal contributions. The total expenses eventually passed $15 billion. Interest brought this cost to $21.93 billion.

===Engineering methods and details===
[[Image:BigDigSupportsCentralArtery.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary supports hold up elevated Central Artery during construction.]]
Several unusual engineering challenges arose during the project, requiring unusual solutions and methods to address them.

At the beginning of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above. Eventually, they created horizontal braces as wide as the tunnel, then cut away the elevated highway's struts, and lowered it onto the new braces.&lt;ref name="AP 122507"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228035119/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071225/ap_on_re_us/big_dig_the_end |archivedate=2007-12-28 |title=Boston's $14.8B Big Dig finally complete |first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=December 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final phases==
[[Image:Tunnel-large.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Interstate 93 Tunnel]]

On January 18, 2003, the opening ceremony was held for the I-90 Connector Tunnel, extending the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) east into the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], and onwards to Boston [[Logan International Airport]]. The Ted Williams tunnel had been completed and was in limited use for commercial traffic and [[high-occupancy vehicle]]s since late 1995. The westbound lanes opened on the afternoon of January 18 and the eastbound lanes on January 19.

The next phase, moving the elevated Interstate 93 underground, was completed in two stages: northbound lanes opened in March 2003 and southbound lanes (in a temporary configuration) on December 20, 2003. A tunnel underneath [[Leverett Circle]] connecting eastbound Storrow Drive to I-93 North and the Tobin Bridge opened December 19, 2004, easing congestion at the circle. All southbound lanes of I-93 opened to traffic on March 5, 2005, including the left lane of the Zakim Bridge, and all of the refurbished [[Dewey Square Tunnel]].

By the end of December 2004, 95% of the Big Dig was completed. Major construction remained on the surface, including construction of final ramp configurations in the [[North End, Boston, Massachusetts|North End]] and in the [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] interchange, and reconstruction of the surface streets.

The final ramp downtown — exit 20B from [[Interstate 93|I-93]] south to [[Albany Street (Boston)|Albany Street]] — opened January 13, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Casey | last=Ross | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/969503741.html?dids=969503741:969503741&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+14%2C+2006&amp;author=CASEY+ROSS&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=009&amp;desc=Hallelujah+Hub+drivers!+Last+Big+Dig+ramp+done | title=Hallelujah Hub drivers!

In 2006, the two Interstate 93 tunnels were dedicated as the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]], after the former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] speaker of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from Massachusetts who pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government.

==Coordinated projects==
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was required under the Federal Clean Air Act to mitigate air pollution generated by the highway improvements.  Secretary of Transportation Fred Salvucci signed an agreement with the Conservation Law Foundation in 1990 enumerating 14 specific projects the state agreed to build.  This list was affirmed in a 1992 lawsuit settlement.&lt;ref name="step"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somervillestep.org/2005/04/commonwealth_ma.html|title=STEP: Commonwealth Magazine article against Green Line|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160222044336/http://www.somervillestep.org/2005/04/commonwealth_ma.html|archivedate=2016-02-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, several mitigation projects were incomplete:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Portals/17/docs/sip/SummaryOct06_2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821063244/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Portals/17/docs/sip/SummaryOct06_2014.pdf |archivedate=2015-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Green Line Extension]] to [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]]
* [[Fairmount Line]] improvements
* Design of the Red-Blue Connector at Charles Street (under petition to remove from list)

Some projects, such as restoration of [[Green Line "E" Branch|Green Line "E" Arborway service]], were removed from the list of mitigation projects and replaced with other projects with similar air-quality improvements.

===Surface treatments===
Some surface treatments, that were part of the original project plan, were dropped due to the massive cost overruns on the highway portion of the project.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} For example, the [[North Point Park (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|North Point Park]] was created as part of the project, but it ended without constructing pedestrian bridges to neighboring parks.  The bridges were later funded by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

===Public art===
While not a legally mandated requirement, [[public art]] was part of the urban design planning process (and later design development work) through the Artery Arts Program. The intent of the program was to integrate public art into highway infrastructure (retaining walls, fences, and lighting) and the essential elements of the pedestrian environment (walkways, park landscape elements, and bridges). As overall project costs increased, the Artery Arts Program was seen as a potential liability, even though there was support and interest from the public and professional arts organizations in the area.

At the beginning of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former [[West End, Boston|West End]] houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near [[North Station]] by artist [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]]; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]] in parcel 17; a historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder [[Donald McKay]] in [[East Boston]]; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the [[Millers River (Middlesex)|Miller's River]] Littoral Way walkway and lighting under the loop ramps north of the [[Charles River]].

Extensive landscape planting, as well as a maintenance program to support the plantings, was requested by many community members during public meetings. &lt;!-- need more details on landscape program here --&gt;

==Impact on traffic==
[[Image:ONeilltoZakimBridge.agr.jpg|thumb|Traffic exiting the Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel onto the Zakim Bridge.]]
The Big Dig untangled the co-mingled traffic from the Massachusetts Turnpike and the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels. While only one net lane in each direction was added to the north–south I-93, several new east–west lanes became available. East–west traffic on the Massachusetts Turnpike/I-90 now proceeds directly through the Ted Williams Tunnel to Logan Airport and Route 1A beyond. Traffic between Storrow Drive and the Callahan and Sumner Tunnels still uses a short portion of I-93, but additional lanes and direct connections are provided for this traffic.

The result was a 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive, from an average 38,200 hours per day before construction (1994–1995) to 14,800 hours per day in 2004–2005, after the project was largely complete.&lt;ref name=impactreport&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }} Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-6: {{cite web |url= http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |title= Archived copy |accessdate=November 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |archivedate= January 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The savings for travelers was estimated at $166 million annually in the same 2004–2005 time frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, p. 24]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Travel times on the Central Artery northbound during the afternoon peak hour were reduced 85.6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf Transportation Impacts of MTA and CAT project, February 2006, Table 3-1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108043647/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/downloads/financial/MTA-Economic-V1.pdf |date=January 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 ''Boston Globe'' report asserted that waiting time for the majority of trips actually increased as a result of [[induced demand|demand induced]] by the increased road capacity. Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster). The report states, "Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less."  The ''Globe'' also asserted that their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs. That study did not look at highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Murphy | first=Sean | date=2008-11-16 | title=Big Dig pushes bottlenecks outward | work=Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/big_dig_pushes_bottlenecks_outward/ | accessdate=2009-04-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090401210807/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/big_dig_pushes_bottlenecks_outward/| archivedate= 1 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations Control Center (OCC)==
{{anchor|Operations Control Center (OCC)}}
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}

As part of the project, an elaborate Operations Control Center (OCC) [[control room]] was constructed in [[South Boston]]. Staffed on a "[[24/7/365]]" basis, this center monitors and reports on [[traffic congestion]], and responds to emergencies. Continuous [[video surveillance]] is provided by hundreds of cameras, and thousands of sensors monitor traffic speed and density, [[air quality]], water levels, temperatures, equipment status, and other conditions inside the tunnel. The OCC can activate [[Ventilation (firefighting)|emergency ventilation]] fans, change [[Variable-message sign|electronic display signs]], and dispatch service crews when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Christine M.|author2=Edward L.

==="Thousands of leaks"===
As far back as 2001, Turnpike Authority officials and contractors knew of thousands of leaks in ceiling and wall fissures, extensive water damage to steel supports and fireproofing systems, and overloaded drainage systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found - Big Dig News Story - WCVB Boston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523164349/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html |date=May 23, 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A $10 million contract, Riwaj signed off as a [[cost overrun]], was used to repair these leaks. Many of the leaks were a result of [[Modern Continental]] and other subcontractors failing to remove gravel and other debris before pouring concrete. This information was not made public; engineers at MIT (volunteer students and professors) performed several experiments and found serious problems with the tunnel.&lt;ref name="evenmorebigleaks"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Report: Even More Big Dig Leaks Found |url=http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html |publisher=WCVB-TV |date=2004-11-17 |accessdate=2006-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523164349/http://www.thebostonchannel.com/bigdig/3924866/detail.html |archivedate=May 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2004, a major leak in the [[Interstate 93]] north tunnel forced the closure of the tunnel while repairs were conducted. This also forced the Turnpike Authority to release information regarding its non-disclosure of prior leaks. A follow-up reported on "extensive" leaks that were more severe than state authorities had previously acknowledged. The report went on to state that the $14.6 billion tunnel system was riddled with more than 400 leaks. A ''[[Boston Globe]]'' report, however, countered that by stating there were nearly 700 leaks in a single {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} section of tunnel beneath [[South Station]]. Turnpike officials also stated that the number of leaks being investigated was down from 1,000 to 500.&lt;ref name="evenmorebigleaks" /&gt;

The problem of leaks is further aggravated by the fact that many of them involve corrosive [[Seawater|salt water]]. This is caused by the proximity of [[Boston Harbor]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by [[road salt]] spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through.&lt;ref name="54m-fix"/&gt; Salt water and [[salt spray]] are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any [[marine environment]]. It has been reported that "hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly" in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing "hot spots" where water leakage is especially serious.&lt;ref name="CorrosionGraphic"/&gt; Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded [[rebar]] and other [[structural steel]] reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.&lt;ref name="54m-fix"/&gt;

The much larger than expected volume of water that must be continuously pumped consumes a correspondingly larger amount of electrical power, and will cause the pumps to wear out much sooner than originally estimated.

===Substandard materials===
{{update|section|date=December 2012|what happened after the arrests and charges}}
[[Massachusetts State Police]] searched the offices of [[Aggregate Industries]], the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the project, in June 2005. They seized evidence that Aggregate delivered concrete that did not meet contract specifications. In March 2006  Massachusetts Attorney General [[Thomas Reilly|Tom Reilly]] announced plans to sue project contractors and others because of poor work on the project. Over 200 complaints were filed by the state of Massachusetts as a result of leaks, cost overruns, quality concerns, and safety violations. In total, the state has sought approximately $100 million from the contractors ($1 for every $141 spent).&lt;ref name="Reuters-StateWeighs"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/19/news/notes.php |title=State weighs suing 'Big Dig' contractors |work=International Herald Tribune |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2006-07-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060718094219/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/03/19/news/notes.php| archivedate= 18 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2006, six employees of the company were arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. In July 2007, Aggregate Industries settled the case with an agreement to pay $50 million. $42 million of the settlement went to civil cases and $8 million was paid in criminal fines. The company will provide $75 million in insurance for maintenance as well as pay $500,000 toward routine checks on areas suspected to contain substandard concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2007/07/30/82122.htm |title=Concrete Supplier to Pay $50 Million to Settle Big Dig Case |publisher=Insurancejournal.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212726/http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2007/07/30/82122.htm |archivedate=2014-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Ginsu guardrails"===
Public safety workers have called the walkway safety handrails in the Big Dig tunnels "[[ginsu]] guardrails", because the squared-off edges of the support posts have caused mutilations and deaths of passengers ejected from crashed vehicles. After an eighth reported death involving the safety handrails, [[MassDOT]] officials announced plans to cover or remove the allegedly dangerous fixtures, but only near curves or exit ramps.&lt;ref name=Carroll-Rails&gt;{{cite web|last=Carroll |first=Matt |title=State plans to remove many rails in tunnels |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/04/15/state_plans_to_remove_or_cover_big_dig_tunnel_railings_after_deaths/ |work=boston.com |publisher=The Boston Globe |accessdate=2012-04-09 |date=April 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210024625/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/04/15/state_plans_to_remove_or_cover_big_dig_tunnel_railings_after_deaths/ |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This partial removal of hazards has been criticized by a safety specialist, who suggests that the handrails are just as dangerous in straight sections of the tunnel.&lt;ref name="Carroll-Rails"/&gt;

===Lighting fixtures===
In March 2011, it became known that senior MassDOT officials had failed to disclose an issue with the lighting fixtures in the O'Neill tunnel. In early February 2011, a maintenance crew found a fixture lying in the middle travel lane in the northbound tunnel.&lt;ref name="Moskowitz-lights"&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric |last=Moskowitz |title=State says some light fixtures in Big Dig tunnels are flawed |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-03-16/news/29350222_1_tunnels-fixtures-fluorescent-lights |work=Boston Globe |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426004212/http://articles.boston.com/2011-03-16/news/29350222_1_tunnels-fixtures-fluorescent-lights |archivedate=26 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming it to be simple [[road debris]], the maintenance team picked it up and brought it back to its home facility. The next day, a supervisor passing through the yard realized that the {{convert|120|lb|kg|abbr=on}} fixture was not road debris but was in fact one of the fixtures used to light the tunnel itself. Further investigation revealed that the fixture's mounting apparatus had failed, due to [[galvanic corrosion]] of incompatible metals, caused by having [[aluminum]] in direct contact with [[stainless steel]], in the presence of salt water.&lt;ref name=CorrosionGraphic&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mysterious Corroding Big Dig Light Fixtures |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/20110710_tunnels_light_fixtures/ |work=boston.com |publisher=The Boston Globe |accessdate=2012-04-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407223210/http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/20110710_tunnels_light_fixtures/ |archivedate=April 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ENR-Salt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knapschaefer|first=Johanna|title=MassDOT Study Blames Salt For Big Dig's Fallen Light Fixture|journal=Engineering News-Record|date=April 27, 2011|url=http://enr.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221233320/http://www.enr.com/|archivedate=December 21, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[electrochemical]] [[potential difference]] between stainless steel and aluminum is in the range of 0.5 to 1.0V, depending on the exact alloys involved, and can cause considerable corrosion within months under unfavorable conditions.

After the discovery of the reason why the fixture had failed, a comprehensive inspection of the other fixtures in the tunnel revealed that numerous other fixtures were also in the same state of deterioration.&lt;ref name=Mullan-Light&gt;{{cite web|last=Mullan|first=Jeff|title=Tunnel Safety Ceiling Light Fixture Update|url=http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/portals/8/docs/TunnelSafety/TnnlSafetyBoardRpt040611.pdf|work=Report to the MassDOT Board of Directors|publisher=MassDOT|date=April 6, 2011|accessdate=2012-04-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701232403/http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/portals/8/docs/TunnelSafety/TnnlSafetyBoardRpt040611.pdf|archivedate=July 1, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the worst fixtures were temporarily shored up with plastic ties.&lt;ref name="54m-fix"/&gt; Moving forward with temporary repairs, members of the MassDOT administration team decided not to let the news of the systemic failure and repair of the fixtures be released to the public or to Governor [[Deval Patrick]]'s administration.&lt;ref name="Murphy-lights"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Sean P. |last1=Murphy |first2=Scott |last2=Allen |title=Worries about lights were kept in the dark |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-07-10/news/29758587_1_light-fixture-tunnels-state-engineers |work=Boston Globe |date=12 July 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720145746/http://articles.boston.com/2011-07-10/news/29758587_1_light-fixture-tunnels-state-engineers |archivedate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2012|April}}, it appeared that all of the 25,000 light fixtures would have to be replaced, at an estimated cost of $54 million.&lt;ref name=54m-fix&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy|first=Sean P.|date=April 5, 2012|title=Big Dig needs $54m light fix|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-05/news/31295327_1_new-fixtures-entire-fixture-light-replacement-project|work=boston.com|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2012-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406184648/http://articles.boston.com/2012-04-05/news/31295327_1_new-fixtures-entire-fixture-light-replacement-project|archivedate=April 6, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement work is mostly done at night, and requires lane closures or occasional closing of the entire tunnel for safety, and was estimated to take up to 2 years to complete.&lt;ref name="54m-fix"/&gt; {{As of|2016|April}}, replacement of the light fixtures is still ongoing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6026">The '''card catalog''', or "catalog of characteristics," in [[cryptography]], was a system designed by [[Poland|Polish]] [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] mathematician-cryptologist [[Marian Rejewski]], and first completed about 1935 or 1936, to facilitate [[decryption|decrypting]] German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[cipher]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Rejewski]], "The Mathematical Solution of the Enigma Cipher," pp. 284–87.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
==History==
The Polish Cipher Bureau used the theory of [[permutation]]s to start breaking the Enigma cipher in late 1932. The Bureau recognized that the Enigma machine's doubled-key (see [[Grill (cryptology)]]) permutations formed cycles, and those cycles could be used to break the cipher. With German cipher keys provided by a French spy, the Bureau was able to reverse engineer the Enigma and start reading German messages. At the time, the Germans were using only 6 ''steckers'', and the Polish [[Grill (cryptology)|grill method]] was feasible. On 1 August 1936, the Germans started using 8 ''steckers'', and that change made the grill method less feasible. The Bureau needed an improved method to break the German cipher.

Although the ''steckers'' would change which letters were in a doubled-key's cycle, the ''steckers'' would not change the number of cycles or the length of those cycles. Steckers could be ignored. Ignoring the mid-key turnovers, the Enigma machine had only {{math|26&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} distinct settings of the three rotors, and the three rotors could only be arranged in the machine {{math|1=3!=6}} ways. That meant there were only {{#expr:26*26*26*6}} likely doubled-key permutations. The Bureau set about determining and cataloging the characteristic of each of those likely permutations. Each letter of the key could be one of [[partition number]] 13 = 101 possible values, and the 3 letters of the key meant there were {{#expr:101*101*101}} possible keys. On average, a key would find one setting of the rotors, but it might find several possible settings.

The Polish cryptanalyst could then collect enough traffic to determine all the cycles in a daily key. That usually took about 60 messages. The result might be:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
AD &amp;= \texttt{(pjxroquctwzsy)(kvgledmanhfib)} \\
BE &amp;= \texttt{(kxtcoigweh)(zvfbsylrnp)(ujd)(mqa)} \\
CF &amp;= \texttt{(yvxqtdhpim)(skgrjbcolw)(un)(fa)(e)(z)} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
He would use the lengths of the cycles (13&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to look up the wheel order (II I III) and starting rotor positions in the card catalog. He would then use an Enigma to compute the un-''steckered'' cycles:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
AD &amp;= \texttt{(sjxroqtcuzwpy)(kngledamvhifb)} \\
BE &amp;= \texttt{(kxucofgzeh)(wnibpylrvs)(tjd)(aqm)} \\
CF &amp;= \texttt{(ynxqudhsfa)(pkgrjbcolz)(tv)(im)(e)(w)} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
By comparing the ''steckered'' cycles from the German traffic and the un-''steckered'' cycles, the cryptanalyst can determine the ''steckers''. In the example, the ''CF'' permutation has &lt;code&gt;(e)(z)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(e)(w)&lt;/code&gt;. That requires that &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; is un''stecker''ed and a W-Z ''stecker''. The cycles can then be aligned on &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; and W-Z to determine other ''steckered'' and un-''steckered'' letters.
:&lt;code&gt;(pjxroquctwzsy)(kvgledmanhfib)/(kxtcoigweh)...&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;(sjxroqtcuzwpy)(kngledamvhifb)/(kxucofgzeh)...&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;(!_____!_!**!_)(_!__=_!!!_!!_)/(__!__!_*=_)...&lt;/code&gt;
Where &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; is a known un-''steckered'' letter, &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is a known ''steckered'' letter, and &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; is a newly discovered ''stecker''.
Repetition produces the ''steckers'' A-M, F-I, N-V, P-S, T-U, W-Z.

Preparation of the card catalog, using the [[cyclometer]] that Rejewski had invented about 1934 or 1935, was a laborious task that took over a year's time.  But once the catalog was complete, obtaining Enigma daily keys was a matter of some fifteen minutes.&lt;ref name = Rejewski242&gt;[[Marian Rejewski]], "Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...", p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Rejewski]], "How the Polish Mathematicians Broke Enigma," p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Have wheel order, steckers, and message key but not the ring setting --&gt;
 
When the Germans changed the Enigma machine's "[[reflector (cipher machine)|reflector]]," or "reversing drum," on 1 November 1937, the Cipher Bureau was forced to start over again with a new card catalog:  "a task," writes Rejewski, "which consumed, on account of our greater experience, probably somewhat less than a year's time."&lt;ref name = Rejewski242/&gt;

On 15 September 1938 the Germans completely changed the procedure for enciphering message keys, rendering the card-catalog method useless. This spurred the invention of Rejewski's [[Bomba (cryptography)|cryptologic bomb]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]]'s "[[perforated sheets]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Rejewski]], "Summary of Our Methods for Reconstructing ENIGMA and Reconstructing Daily Keys...", pp. 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cocktails mit Schirmchen.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Cocktail]]s with umbrellas]]
[[File:Cocktail umbrella side.jpg|thumb|A typical cocktail umbrella. Notice the pink ring on the toothpick - it exists to keep the umbrella propped open.]]

A '''cocktail umbrella''' is a small [[umbrella]] or [[parasol]] made from paper, [[paperboard]], and a [[toothpick]], used as a [[cocktail garnish|garnish]] or decoration in [[cocktail]]s, [[dessert]]s or other food and beverages.

==Description==
The umbrella is fashioned out of paper, which can be patterned, with cardboard ribs. The ribs are made from cardboard in order to provide flexibility and to hinge so the umbrella can be pulled shut much like an ordinary umbrella. A small plastic retaining ring is often fashioned against the stem, a toothpick, in order to prevent the umbrella from folding up spontaneously. A sleeve of folded newspaper is located under the collar or base of the cocktail umbrella and is made out of recycled paper from either [[China]], [[India]] or [[Japan]]. As a result, they indicate their country of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.factswt.com/did-you-know-that-all-cocktail-umbrellas-are-made-out-of-recycled-chinese/ |title= Did you know that all cocktail umbrellas are made out of recycled Chinese...

Most of the drinks that cocktail umbrellas are found in are tropical drinks. However, they are not all tiki drinks, as some would call them. To be considered a tiki drink, the cocktail must contain [[rum]] and exotic fruit juices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tikitolteca.com/what-is-a-tiki-drink/|title=What is a Tiki Drink? - Tiki Tolteca|date=2015-10-21|work=Tiki Tolteca|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this definition, drinks such as pina colodas would be considered tiki drinks, but ones like the Hawaiian margarita would only be considered tropical. This is due to the fact that the Hawaiian margarita contains tequila instead of rum.

==Origin and history==
Nobody is quite certain exactly when the cocktail umbrella came into use. One possible source is [[Donn Beach]], owner of the [[Hollywood, California]]-based restaurant and bar chain Don the Beachcomber. According to cocktail historian [[Dale DeGroff]], Beach started the trend in 1932 after spending much of his time collecting things from around the world, most notably from the South Pacific. Beach sold his merchandise, including the cocktail umbrellas, to Victor Bergeron, owner of the [[Emeryville, California]]-based bar chain [[Trader Vic's|Trader Vic’s]]. According to Bergeron’s son Joe, Trader Vic’s used the paper parasols until their production was halted by [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://talesofthecocktail.com/history/myth-and-history-cocktail-umbrella|title=The Myth (and History) of the Cocktail Umbrella|last=McLafferty|first=Clair|date=19 February 2016|website=Tales of the Cocktail|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hawaiian-themed author Rick Carroll, Hawaiian bartender [[Harry Yee|Harry K. Yee]] of the Hilton Waikiki was the first to use a paper parasol in a beverage in 1959 during the [[Tiki culture]] craze of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kevdo.com/maitai/harryyee.html|title=The Search for the Ultimate Mai Tai: Harry Yee, King of Tropical Cocktails|last=Crossman|first=Kevin|website=www.kevdo.com|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yee stated that he initially would use a sugar cane stick as a garnish for his tropical cocktails, but upon seeing how guests would set the sticks in ashtrays and dirty them, switched to [[Vanda (orchid)|Vanda orchids]] in 1955. In 1959, Yee switched to the cocktail umbrella for reasons unknown. Some speculate that it’s because the bar already stocked the umbrellas as toothpicks or decoration, so they were more readily available.

Another theory exists that Beach met Yee while vacationing in Hawaii after World War II. It is there that Beach and Yee traded cocktail ideas, recipes, and somewhere along the line, cocktail umbrellas. Afterwards, both of the bartenders began to use the umbrellas in tropical drinks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.supercall.com/culture/why-serve-drinks-with-umbrellas|title=The Real Reason We Put Paper Umbrellas in Tropical Drinks|last=Mancall-Bitel|first=Nicholas|date=2017-08-31|work=Supercall|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tiki culture craze ==
Cocktail umbrellas are a [[Great Depression]]-era invention, but they didn't take off in popularity until after World War II. According to an [[Eater (website)|Eater]] article published in 2015, many people, during the difficult times faced during the Great Depression, saw the South Pacific as "a place of exotic abandon, where you didn't have to work for a living." Many poor Americans saw tiki culture as an escape from reality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eater.com/drinks/2015/8/4/9092437/the-rise-fall-and-resurgence-of-tiki-cocktails|title=How Tiki Cocktails Returned to Rock the Party, Again|work=Eater|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of the middle class after World War II came families with disposable income. That, combined with Hawaii's statehood and the rise of commercial air travel in the late 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/heyday/heyday11.cfm|title=The Era of Mass Air Travel Begins {{!}} America by Air|website=airandspace.si.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to an explosion in the popularity of tiki culture dubbed the "tiki craze". Tiki bars like Trader Vic's and Don the Beachcomber took advantage of the tiki craze, inventing slews of cocktails with a key identifying factor: a cocktail umbrella. The cocktail umbrella became synonymous with tiki cocktails, so much so that the drinks are often called "umbrella drinks".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
[[File:SantaMartaCarnival2013 24.JPG|thumb|Cocktail umbrella in a pineapple drink.]]
The true purpose of the cocktail umbrella is unknown. Some bartenders say that the cocktail umbrella is only decorative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other bartenders have argued that the umbrella provides shade that slows the melting of ice when the drink is served outdoors. However, the temperature outside matters more than direct sunlight when it comes to the melting of ice. The shade from the cocktail umbrella would do nothing to slow this down.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Another hypothesis about the cocktail umbrella’s purpose is that its absence can lead to faster evaporation of alcohol due to direct sunlight when the drink is severed outdoors. Chemists reject this idea and explain that the presence of a cocktail umbrella has no effect on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/cocktails/article/cocktail-umbrella-history|title=The Exciting History and Origin of the Cocktail Umbrella|last=Bilow|first=Rochelle|work=Bon Appetit|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, cocktail umbrellas have served as a gimmick to draw women into bars that were mostly frequented by men. However, this purpose has faded in current times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/11/02/Why-Do-They-Put-Umbrellas-in-Your-Drink/|title=Why Do They Put Umbrellas in Your Drink?|work=Neatorama|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the cocktail umbrella has become an important part of the drinks it is found on. It has become a garnish that is essential to the identities of these drinks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cocktail garnishes started being used in the 19th century, with non-edible garnishes being introduced after prohibition. Two examples of these non-edible garnishes are cocktail umbrellas and [[swizzle stick]]s. Since their introduction, cocktail umbrellas use as a garnish has become a large part of their purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://punchdrink.com/articles/cocktail-garnishes-evolution-history-tiki-garnish/|title=PUNCH {{!}} The Gonzo Age of the Cocktail Garnish|last=Punch|website=punchdrink.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a garnish, they complete the drink's presentation and identify it as tropical. However, cocktail umbrellas differ from other drink garnishes. Unlike foods commonly used as garnishes, such as cherries, olives, or citrus, cocktail umbrellas do not add to the flavor of the drink and have a purely aesthetic purpose.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.supercall.com/culture/cocktail-and-drink-garnishes|title=Why You Should Never Skip the Garnish On Your Cocktail|last=Mafit|first=Dillon|date=2017-03-07|work=Supercall|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative uses for cocktail umbrellas also exist. They can be used as toothpicks and may have been used as hat decorations in the past.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also possible to use them as hair decorations and [[place card]]s to tell people where to sit at a hosted event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://everydaypartymag.com/summer-parties/5-uses-cocktail-umbrellas|title=5 Uses for Cocktail Umbrellas - Everyday Party Magazine|date=2015-08-31|work=Everyday Party Magazine|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Uses:

Though the most common use for the cocktail umbrella is as a [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]] in drinks there are many other uses people have found. As a decoration piece people have used the umbrellas to make wreaths, table centerpieces, lanterns, and even hair pieces. People have also found ways to turn cocktail umbrellas into art, as is the case with [[Dutch people|Dutch]] trio We Make Carpets. We Make Carpets makes creative carpets out of different everyday objects. For this project, they decided to use 6,000 cocktail umbrellas in their recent creation "Umbrella Carpet 2." This unique use of cocktail umbrellas was displayed at a 2016 design exhibition in the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam|Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/t-magazine/design/dream-out-loud-stedelijk-museum.html|title=When 6,000 Cocktail Umbrellas Become Art|date=2016-08-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Venues ==
The cocktail umbrellas can be seen used in most cocktail lounges, bars, restaurants, and luaus. The most frequent location you can spot the umbrella is restaurants and bars that maintain an "island" theme such as Hawaii.

The '''Digital Firm''' is an organization that has enabled core business relationships through digital networks. These digital networks are supported by enterprise class technology platforms that have been leveraged within an organization to support critical business functions and services. Some examples of these technology platforms are [[Customer relationship management|Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM), [[Supply chain management|Supply Chain Management]] (SCM), [[Enterprise resource planning|Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP), [[Knowledge management|Knowledge Management System]] (KMS), [[Enterprise content management|Enterprise Content Management]] (ECM), and [[Warehouse management system|Warehouse Management System]] (WMS) among others. The purpose of these technology platforms is to digitally enable seamless integration and information exchange within the organization to employees and outside the organization to customers, suppliers, and other business partners.

== History ==

=== Origin of "The Digital Firm" ===
The term "Digital Firm" originated, as a concept in a series of [[Management information system|Management Information Systems]] (MIS) books authored by [[Kenneth C. Laudon]] &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt; and it provides a new way to describe organizations that operate differently than the traditional [[brick and mortar]] business as a result of broad sweeping changes in technology and global markets. Digital firms place an emphasis on the digitization of business processes and services through sophisticated technology and information systems. These information systems create opportunities for digital firms to decentralize operations, accelerate market readiness and responsiveness, enhance customer interactions, as well as increase efficiencies across a variety of business functions.

=== Acceleration of technology adoption ===
Technology adoption has been increasing as digital firms continually look to achieve greater levels cost savings, competitive advantage, and operational performance optimization. As organizations adopt technology, the internal appetite for additional technologies increases and in some cases accelerates.&lt;ref name=Wharton/&gt; This acceleration of technology adoption by digital firms creates a "digital divide"&lt;ref name=Wharton/&gt; as emerging technology is absorbed at varying rates across organizations. This technology divergence can affect competitive dynamics in the market place between firms that achieve operational benefits from the technology and firms which have yet to adapt.

While the growth of new technology consumption is not uniform across organizations, the trend for business-driven investment in technology across all markets has and continues to increase. During the span of 1990 to 2006, the gross U.S. domestic investment in information and communications technology, as measured by the U.S. Census Bureau, increased by 170%.&lt;ref name=Census2012/&gt;

The market for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and other packaged applications started to grow substantially during the 90's to the point that the ERP market alone accounts for approximately $25 billion.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; According to surveys conducted in 2002, nearly "75% of global Fortune 1000 firms had implemented SAP’s ERP suite".&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

== Advantages ==
Through digital networks and information systems, the digital firm is able to operate core business services and functions continuously and more efficiently. This digital enablement of business processes creates highly dynamic information systems allowing for more efficient and productive management of an organization.

Additionally, digital enablement of core business functions and services provides an organization with opportunities to:

* Operate business continuously ("Time Shifting") &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt;
* Operate business in a global workplace ("Space Shifting") &lt;ref name=Laudon /&gt;
* Adapt business strategies to meet market demands &lt;ref name=Bartel /&gt;
* Create business value from technology investments &lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt;
* Drive efficiency improvements in inventory and supply chain &lt;ref name=Bartel /&gt;
* Enhance the management of customer relationships &lt;ref name=CRM /&gt;
* Improve organizational productivity &lt;ref name=ERP2 /&gt;

== Effects on organizational performance ==
Technology and information systems serve many critical roles in a digital firm by providing technology-driven capabilities that increase operational performance. For example, digital networks and information systems allow organizations to connect and integrate supply chains in ways that are real-time, uninterrupted and highly responsive to market conditions.

Another example of an information system that can increase an organization's performance awareness and management capabilities is a [[Real-time business intelligence|Real-Time Business Intelligence (RTBI)]] system. A RTBI system can provide a highly responsive and strategic decision support platform for an organization to analyze operational events as they occur. RTBI systems often work closely with [[Operational risk management|Organizational Risk Management (ORM)]] systems in this capacity to increase capabilities around monitoring operational performance and assessing operational risks. These types of information systems can increase an organization's capabilities to effectively manage performance and productivity.

The three main enterprise information systems that can positively affect an organization's performance and productivity are:

=== Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) ===
ERP deployments can be complex and require a significant shift in business operations for an organization but the benefits can be substantial.

After implementation of an ERP system within an organization there are measurable performance and productivity gains that can be directly correlated to the ERP system go-live event.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; This study conducted a detailed analysis of the ERP data produced and found that there was a direct causal relationship between ERP systems and performance gains in an organization.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

Organizations that deploy ERP systems typically, based on performance and productivity gains, also implement both of the following enterprise platforms as well.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

=== Customer Relationship Management (CRM) ===
Organizations leverage CRM systems to improve the overall management of their relationships with customers. CRM systems operate as enterprise platforms that provide digital firms with opportunities to closely manage all aspects of interactions with customers through customer-oriented business processes.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;

Organizations which implement CRM systems may encounter some lag time until the CRM productivity affects are fully realized in the firm based on studies.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;  However, the lag effects are difficult to measure and based in part on the organization's ability to leverage the new CRM system and adapt to the changes in business operations as a result.&lt;ref name=CRM/&gt;

=== Supply Chain Management (SCM) ===
Studies of organizations that implemented SCM systems to improve supply chain management capabilities found that those systems had a significant impact on productivity and performance within the organization.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt; Additionally, the implementation of SCM and CRM systems differed from an ERP implementation in that organizational performance could be directly correlated "with both the initial purchase and go-live event".&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

SCM and CRM systems are often viewed as "extended enterprise systems" due to the way that they integrate with ERP systems and the benefits that they bring to organizations.&lt;ref name=ERP2/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11381">'''Digital scent technology''' (or '''olfactory technology''')  is the engineering discipline dealing with [[olfaction|olfactory]] representation. It is a technology to sense, transmit and receive [[odor|scent]]-enabled digital media (such as web pages, [[video game]]s, [[movie]]s and [[music]]). This sensing part of this technology works by using [[olfactometer]]s and [[electronic nose]]s.

==History==
===1950s–1960s===
In the late 1950s, [[Hans Laube]] invented the [[Smell-O-Vision]], a system which released odor during the projection of a film so that the viewer could "smell" what was happening in the movie. The Smell-O-Vision faced competition with [[Smell-O-Vision#Competition with AromaRama|AromaRama]], a similar system invented by Charles Weiss that emitted scents through the air-conditioning system of a theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Movie Review: ''Behind the Great Wall'' (1959) - Smells of China; 'Behind Great Wall' Uses AromaRama|author= Bosley crowther|date= December 10, 1959|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03EEDA103CE63BBC4852DFB4678382649EDE|accessdate=23 September 2012|journal=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Variety'' dubbed the competition "the battle of the smellies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilbert, Avery |year=2008|title=Hollywood Psychophysics" What the Nose Knows|publisher=Crown Publishers|page=159|isbn= 978-1-4000-8234-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smell-O-Vision did not work as intended. According to a ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' review of the mystery comedy film ''[[Scent of Mystery]]'' (1960), which featured the one and only use of Smell-O-Vision, aromas were released with a distracting hissing noise and audience members in the balcony complained that the scents reached them several seconds after the action was shown on the screen. In other parts of the theater, the odors were too faint, causing audience members to sniff loudly in an attempt to catch the scent. These technical problems were mostly corrected after the first few showings, but the poor word of mouth, in conjunction with generally negative reviews of the film itself, led to the decline of Smell-O-Vision.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===1990s–2000s===

[[Image:iSmell.jpg|thumb|right|iSmell prototypes]]
In 1999, DigiScents developed a computer [[peripheral device]] called [[iSmell]], which was designed to emit a smell when a user visited a web site or opened an email. The device contained a cartridge with 128 "primary odors", which could be mixed to replicate natural and man-made odors. DigiScents had indexed thousands of common odors, which could be coded, digitized, and embedded into web pages or email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Martin | first = James A | title = Sniff That Web Site | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,13263-page,1/article.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070115214649/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,13263-page,1/article.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-01-15 | publisher = ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' | date = 1999-10-13 | accessdate = 2007-07-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After $20 million in investment, DigiScents was shut down in 2001 when it was unable to obtain the additional funding it required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Digiscents runs out of cents | url = http://www.internetretailer.com/2001/05/31/digiscents-runs-out-of-cents | publisher = internetretailer.com | date = 31 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, AromaJet developed a scent-generating device prototype called Pinoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aroma Jet|url=http://www.microfab.com/vapor-generation/aromajet|website=www.microfab.com|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; No new announcements have been made since December 2000.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In 2003, TriSenx (founded in 1999) launched a scent-generating device called Scent Dome, which by 2004 was tested by the UK internet service provider [[Telewest]]. This device was about the size of a teapot and could generate up to 60 different smells by releasing particles from one or more of 20 liquid-filled odor capsules. Computers fitted with a Scent Dome unit used software to recognize smell identifying codes embedded in an email or web page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Smelly device would liven up web browsing | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4705-smelly-device-would-liven-up-web-browsing.html | publisher = ''[[New Scientist]]'' | date = 2004-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Tsuji Wellness]] and [[France Telecom]] developed a scent-generating device called Kaori Web, which comes with 6 different cartridges for different smells. The Japanese firm, [[K-Opticom]], had placed special units of this device in their [[internet cafe]]s and other venues until the end of the experiment on March 20, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=esato.com |url=http://www.esato.com/news/article.php/id=203 |title=These images STINK.

In 2005, researchers from the [[University of Huelva]] developed XML Smell, a protocol of XML that can transmit smells. The researchers also developed a scent-generating device and worked on miniaturising its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = XML Smell language developed by university | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1021419/xml-smell-language-developed-university | journal= [[The Inquirer]] | date = 2005-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, [[Thanko]] launched P@D Aroma Generator, a USB device that comes with 3 different cartridges for different smells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i4u.com/1766/thanko-usb-pd-aroma-generator |title=Thanko USB P@D Aroma Generator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Japanese researchers announced that they are working on a [[3D television]] with touch and smell that would be commercially available on the market by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=betanews.com|url=http://www.betanews.com/article/3D-TV-with-Touch-Smell-by-2020/1124471972 |title=3D TV with Touch, Smell by 2020?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
During ThinkNext 2010, the Israeli company Scentcom featured a demo of its scent-generating device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geektime.co.il/thinknext-2010-scentcom/|title=ThinkNext 2010 – Scentcom|date=16 April 2010|website=www.geektime.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a press release from the [[University of California, San Diego]] [[Jacobs School of Engineering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hockmuth|first=Catherine|title=Coming to TV Screens of the Future: a Sense of Smell|url=http://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1082|work=UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering|publisher=UC San Diego|accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  announced a paper published in [[Angewandte Chemie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Hyunsu|title=An X–Y Addressable Matrix Odor-Releasing System Using an On–Off Switchable Device|journal=Angewandte Chemie|date=14 June 2011|volume=50|issue=30|pages=6771–6775|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201102759/abstract|doi=10.1002/anie.201102759|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  describing an optimization and minitaturization of a component that can select and release scents from 10,000 odors, that is intended to be part of a Digital scent solution for TVs and phones.

In October 2012, Aromajoin, a Japanese company, released a small-sized product named Aroma Shooter which contains 6 different solid-type scents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Smell-o-Vision for the Digital Age: Japan Develops USB "Micro Aroma Shooter"|date=November 13, 2012|work=Soranews24|author=Karen Bremer Masuda|url=https://soranews24.com/2012/11/13/smell-o-vision-for-the-digital-age-japan-develops-usb-micro-aroma-shooter/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a group of Japanese researchers unveiled a prototype invention they dubbed a "[[smelling screen]]".  The device combines a digital display with four small fans that direct an emitted odor to a specific spot on the screen. The fans operate at a very low speed, making it difficult for the user to perceive airflow; instead he or she perceives the smell as coming directly out of the screen and object displayed at that location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Japanese scientists create 'Smell-O-Vision' screen|date=April 2, 2013|work=CNET|author=Amanda Kooser|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57577555-1/japanese-scientists-create-smell-o-vision-screen/|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, Raul Porcar (Spain), engineer and inventor developed and patented Olorama Technology, a wireless system with the aim to incorporate scents into movies, Virtual Reality, and all kind of audiovisual experiences.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.digitalavmagazine.com/en/2017/07/03/olorama-technology-incorpora-el-olor-a-las-experiencias-audiovisuales-y-de-realidad-virtual/ |first= Raul |last=Porcar |date=July 3, 2013|title=Olorama incorporate scents into audiovisual experiences|work=DigitalAV Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dragon''' refers to any of several [[remote sensing]] [[image processing]]
software packages. This software provides capabilities for displaying,
analyzing, and interpreting digital images
from earth satellites and raster data files
that represent spatially distributed data.  All the Dragon packages
derive from code created by Goldin-Rudahl
Systems, Incorporated, and focus on geography education:

* '''''OpenDragon''''' is free to educational users. It was intended to be free worldwide, as well as [[open source]] (hence the name) but due to funding problems, is currently available only in Southeast Asia.
* '''''Dragon Academic''''' is functionally identical to OpenDragon.
* '''''Dragon Professional''''' is expanded to handle full-scene data sets from sensors such as [[thematic mapper|Landsat TM]], [[Spot (satellites)|SPOT]], and [[advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer|Aster]].

==History==
The initial version of Dragon was released in 1987 and ran on the [[MS-DOS]]
operating system. Dragon was the first commercial remote sensing software
package designed to use only the native capabilities of off-the-shelf personal
computers. At the time Dragon was developed, other PC remote sensing products
such as [[ERDAS IMAGINE|Erdas]] required expensive special purpose graphics
devices. Dragon was intended to be used for education in geography, geology,
forestry and other disciplines that use spatial information; thus it was very
important to minimize the costs of required hardware. The first version
of Dragon ran on a basic IBM-PC with two floppy disks and a
four-color or gray-level graphics display. Alternatively, it could use any of several models of Japanese PC.

The MS-DOS phase of Dragon development focused on trying to squeeze
functionality into very limited disk and memory space, and to get full-color
image display using [[Computer display standard| rapidly changing graphics
hardware]] with no standardized drivers. The [[VESA]] display standard was a
turning point in making full-color display functionality available in
MS-DOS. This VESA/SVGA/MS-DOS version of Dragon can still be adapted
for embedded systems use.

The move to [[Microsoft Windows]] 95/98 was painful because these
operating systems did not provide true multitasking. Unfortunately this phase
coincided with the publication of the well-known Gibson and Powers textbook
(Gibson,2000) which included a copy of the Windows 95 Dragon. With the advent
of Windows NT and successors (Windows 2000, XP, Vista, etc.), it became
possible to create a Windows version of Dragon that allowed simultaneous
display of and interaction with multiple images.

In 2004, funding became available from Thailand to create a free educational
version of the software which became known as OpenDragon. This project lasted
for three years.  The software is still available at no cost in Thailand,
Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam (although it has only been translated into Thai).

After funding for OpenDragon was discontinued, Dragon Professional was
developed to reach beyond the customary educational users. New personal
computer capabilities, which by then extended to gigabytes of memory and
hundreds of gigabytes of disk storage, all at low cost, made it possible to
store and process the very large data sets produced by twenty-first-century
high-resolution satellites.

Dragon Professional required major changes in the user interaction model,
which previously had assumed a 1-to-1 relationship between the image on the
screen and the sensor data. At the same time, image processing operations such
as selection of ground control points require access to individual data
elements (pixels) selected from the more than 30 million available in a
typical full-scene image. Thus, the appearance and behavior of Dragon
Professional are quite different from OpenDragon/Dragon Academic.

==The name==
Asian dragons are considered symbolic of wisdom and knowledge, unlike the
ferocious western dragons. Thus, the name Dragon/ips(r) or Dragon Image
Processing System is intended to imply wisdom in the knowledge of and
intelligent use of the world in which we live.

==The Software==
Because the expected user is assumed to be relatively untrained, Dragon pays
more attention to the user experience than to having a large selection of
possibly obscure processing operations. Within the user interface, which has
been translated into several languages, context-sensitive help explains every
user choice, and reasonable defaults are provided where possible. The User
Manual (English only) details all processing algorithms.

The software provides a fairly conventional set of remote sensing operations,
which are intended to be those which a student of geography arguably ought to
know.  These include:

# Single and multiband image display;
# Filtering for image enhancement;
# Band combinations such as sum and ratio;
# Principal components analysis;
# Image statistics and measurement;
# A variety of supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms;
# Registration and geometric correction;
# Heads-up digitizing to capture vector data;
# Some raster geographic information systems [[geographic information system|GIS]] operations such as slope, aspect, and buffer calculations;
# Import from and export to various standard image file formats such as [[GeoTIFF]].

In order to provide interoperability with other software packages, and to permit users
to add their own custom processing operations, all important file formats are
documented and an API called the Programmer's Toolkit is available.

==Problems==
# Dragon Academic and Dragon Professional use a USB ''dongle'' for copy protection. While this allows the license to permit unlimited copying, it is also sometimes inconvenient. Other protection methods are being considered.
# Supervised and unsupervised classification operations in all versions of the software currently can process only four image bands at a time.
# Dragon can measure length and area on any [[georeference]]d image. However this assumes the image uses a distance-preserving [[projection (cartography)|projection]]. If the image uses [[geographic coordinate system|latitude-longitude]], the measurements will be incorrect in high latitudes.
# The software runs only on Microsoft Windows, although three of its four components also build and run on [[Linux]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">[[Image:DishDrawers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Fisher &amp; Paykel DishDrawer model]]
A '''dishdrawer''' is a type of [[dishwasher|dishwashing]] machine invented, designed and manufactured by [[Fisher &amp; Paykel]]. They are available under several brands depending on geographic location Fisher &amp; Paykel, [[Kenmore Appliances]], [[KitchenAid]], and [[Bauknecht (company)|Bauknecht]] following a distribution agreement with [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharechat.co.nz/features/iinterviews/article.php/17ad5077 |title=ShareChat Investor Interview: Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances,|first=John |last=Bongard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Fisher &amp; Paykel staff engineer Adrian Sargeant and designer Phil Brace developed the DishDrawer concept. A DishDrawer is based on a design similar to [[filing cabinet]] with each dishwasher having two fully independent cabinets (or drawers). The DishDrawer was exhibited in 1996 at [[Domotechnica]] and was launched in 1997. By this time Fisher &amp; Paykel had spent $10 million on the machine's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesshistory.auckland.ac.nz/fisher_paykel/key_events.html |title=Business History Project, Fisher &amp; Paykel |publisher=[[University of Auckland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are marketed as either an individual drawer, for small apartments or homes or double units which have two separate drawers stacked together. Each drawer is independent, allowing different wash settings to be used on different loads. It also allows dishes to be washed in one drawer as the other is filled. And is potentially more energy efficient. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

DishDrawer washers have capacity restrictions due to their lower height, limiting the size of dishes that can be placed inside. In response to this, Fisher &amp; Paykel have added 'Tall' models to their DishDrawer line up.
Early models were subject to complaints about the noise that they made when washing. This has been improved on with later models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Passarella |url=http://www.thekitchn.com/pros-and-cons-of-the-fisher-pa-95445 |title=Pros and Cons of the Fisher &amp; Paykel Dish Drawers Product Reviews |publisher=The Kitchn |date=11 September 2009 |accessdate=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept behind the dishdrawer is "to use compact technologies to provide a very space efficient dishwasher". "The dishdrawer caused quite a stir when it was launched and has been going from strength to strength ever since". "The drawer action means you load the dishwasher from the top which is much easier on the back.  Fisher and Paykel have made several dish drawer configurations with single and double varieties available.  This means you can install two single dishdrawers side by side toward the top of the bench for easy access or you can install a double dishdrawer where the two drawers are stacked.  DishDrawers provide plenty of flexibility" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Gray |url=http://www.whitegoodsonline.com.au/whitegoods-online/tag/DishDrawers |title=Fisher &amp; Paykel Double DishDrawer DD60DCX7  |publisher=whitegoodsonline.com.au |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Faint Object Camera''' ('''FOC''') was a [[camera]] installed on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] from launch in 1990 until 2002. It was replaced by the [[Advanced Camera for Surveys]]. In December 1993, Hubble's vision was corrected on STS-61 by installing COSTARS, which corrected the problem with Hubble's mirror before it reached an instrument like FOC. Later instruments had this correction built in, which is why it was possible to later remove COSTARS itself and replace it with a new science instrument.

The camera was built by [[Dornier GmbH]] and was funded by the [[European Space Agency]].  The unit actually consists of two complete and independent camera systems designed to provide extremely high resolution, exceeding 0.05 [[arcsecond]]s.  It is designed to view very faint UV and optical light from 115 to 650 nanometers in wavelength.&lt;ref name="CP-2244"&gt;{{cite techreport |title=The Space Telescope Observatory |number=CP-2244 |institution=NASA |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19820025420 |date=1982}}, page 40. A 40 MB PDF file.&lt;/ref&gt; FOC has been compared to a "telephoto" lens, providing a high resolution in a small field of view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/nuts_.and._bolts/instruments/foc/].&lt;/ref&gt; FOC could distinguish between two points 0.05 [[arc-second]]s apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/nuts_.and._bolts/instruments/foc/].&lt;/ref&gt;

The camera was designed to operate at low, medium, or high resolution.  The angular resolution and field of view at each resolution were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;

'''Free viewpoint television''' (FTV) is a system for viewing natural video, allowing the user to interactively control the viewpoint and generate new views of a dynamic scene from any 3D position.
The equivalent system for [[Computer simulation|computer-simulated]] video is known as [[virtual reality]]. With FTV, the focus of attention can be controlled by the viewers rather than a director, meaning that each viewer may be observing a unique viewpoint. It remains to be seen how FTV will affect television watching as a group activity.

== History ==
Systems for rendering arbitrary views of natural scenes have been well known in the [[computer vision]] community for a long time but only in recent years has the speed and quality reached levels that are suitable for serious consideration as an end user system.

Professor Masayuki Tanimoto from [[Nagoya University]] (Japan) has done much to promote the use of the term "free viewpoint television" and has published many papers on the [[ray space representation]], although other techniques can be, and are used for FTV.

[[QuickTime VR]] might be considered a predecessor to FTV.

== Capture and display ==
In order to acquire the views necessary to allow a high quality rendering of the scene from any angle, several cameras are placed around the scene; either in a studio environment or an outdoor venue, such as a sporting arena for example. The output Multiview Video (MVV) must then be packaged suitably so that the data may be compressed and also so that the users' viewing device may easily access the relevant views to interpolate new views.

It is not enough to simply place cameras around the scene to be captured. The geometry of the camera set up must be measured by a process known in computer vision as "camera calibration." Manual alignment would be too cumbersome so typically a "best effort" alignment is performed prior to capturing a test pattern that is used to generate calibration parameters.

Restricted free viewpoint television views for large environments can be captured from a single location camera system mounted on a moving platform. Depth data must also be captured, which is necessary to generate the free viewpoint. The [[Google Street View]] capture system is an example with limited functionality. The first full commercial implementation, [[Real Time Race#iFlex|iFlex]], was delivered in 2009 by [[Real Time Race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diseno-art.com/news/real_time_racing.html |title=Real Time Racing &amp;#124; Automotive News |publisher=Diseno-art.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiview video capture varies from partial (usually about 30 degrees) to complete (360 degrees) coverage of the scene. Therefore, it is possible to output stereoscopic views suitable for viewing with a 3D display or other 3D methods. Systems with more physical cameras can capture images with more coverage of the viewable scene, however, it is likely that certain regions will always be occluded from any viewpoint. A larger number of cameras should make it possible to obtain high quality output because less interpolation is needed.

More cameras mean that efficient coding of the Multiview Video is required. This may not be such a big disadvantage as there are representations that can remove the redundancy in MVV; such as inter view coding using [[MPEG-4]] or [[Multiview Video Coding]], the [[ray space]] representation, geometry videos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hhoppe.com/proj/gvid/ |title=Geometry videos: A new representation for 3D animations|accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} etc.

In terms of hardware, the user requires a viewing device that can decode MVV and synthesize new viewpoints, and a 2D or 3D display.

== Standardization ==
The [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG) has normalized Annex H of [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]] in March 2009 called [[Multiview Video Coding]] after the work of a group called '3DAV' (3D Audio and Visual) headed by Aljoscha Smolic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iphome.hhi.de/smolic/personal.html |title=Joschi's Home (Aljoscha Smolic) |publisher=Iphome.hhi.de |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Heinrich-Hertz Institute]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="926">'''Functional analogs''' (or '''functional analogues''') are entities (models, representations, etc.) that can be replaced, to fulfill the same function.  When the entities in question are formally represented by [[black box]]es, the concept of ''analog'' is related to "same behavior": they take the same output sequence when submitted to the same input sequence.

== Systems engineering==
[[Image:Thevenin equivalent.png|frame|right|Any ''black box'' containing resistances only, with voltage and current sources, can be replaced to a [[Thévenin's theorem|Thévenin equivalent circuit]], to show the same behavior.]]

[[Analogical models]] are used in a method of representing a ‘[[Open system (systems theory)|target system]]’ by another, more understandable or analysable system. Two systems have "analog functions" (see illustration) if the black box representation of both can be the same.

'''George Charles Devol Jr.''' (February 20, 1912&amp;nbsp;– August 11, 2011) was an American [[inventor]] known for developing [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot|material handling robot]] employed in industrial production work.

==Early life==

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 1912, Devol was interested from boyhood in all things electrical and mechanical such as boats, airplanes, and engines.

==United Cinephone==

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Phantom Doorman.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Phantom Doorman [[automatic door]]]]
Choosing to forego higher education, in 1932 Devol went into business, forming [[United Cinephone]] to produce variable area recording directly onto film for the new sound motion pictures ("talkies").  However, he later learned that companies like RCA and Western Electric were working in the same area, and decided to discontinue the product.

==World War II==

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
In 1939, Devol applied for a patent for proximity controls for use in laundry press machines, based on a radio frequency field. This control would automatically open and close laundry presses when workers approached the machines. Once the war began, Devol was advised by the patent office that his patent application would be placed on hold for the duration of the conflict.

Around the time the [[World War II]] began, Devol sold his interest in United Cinephone and approached [[Sperry Gyroscope]] to see if they were interested in his ideas on radar technology. He was retained by Sperry as manager of the Special Projects Department that developed radar devices and microwave test equipment.

Later in the war, he approached [[Auto-Ordnance Company]] regarding products that company could produce aside from their primary product line, which were [[Thompson submachine gun]]s.  Devol told them that the field of radar counter-measures was about to emerge as an urgently needed defense technology.

In 1943, he organized General Electronics Industries in Greenwich, Connecticut, as a subsidiary of the Auto Ordinance Corporation. General Electronics produced counter-radar devices until the end of the War. General Electronics was one of the largest producers of radar and radar counter-measure equipment for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Army Air Force and other government agencies. The company's radar counter-measure systems were on allied planes on D-Day.

Over a difference of opinion regarding the future of certain projects, Devol resigned from Auto Ordinance and joined RCA. After a short stint as eastern sales manager of electronics products, which he felt "wasn't his ball of wax", Devol left RCA to develop ideas that eventually led to the patent application for the first industrial robot. In 1946 he applied for a patent on a magnetic recording system for controlling machines and a digital playback device for machines.

Devol was part of the team that developed the first commercial use of microwave oven technology, the Speedy Weeny, which automatically cooked and dispensed hotdogs in places such as [[Grand Central Terminal]].

In the early 1950s, Devol licensed his digital magnetic recording device to Remington Rand of Norwalk, CT and became manager of their magnetics department.  There he worked with a team to develop his magnetic recording system for business data applications.  He also worked on developing the first high-speed printing systems.  While the magnetic recording system proved too slow for business data, Devol's invention was re-purposed as a machine control that would eventually become the "brains" of the Unimate robot.

==The first industrial robot: Unimate==

[[File:First DC Magnetic Recorder.jpg|thumb|140px|left|The first static magnetic recorder that used a saw blade to record information]]
In the 1940s, Devol wasn't thinking about robots. Instead, he was focusing on manipulators and his patent on [[magnetic recording]] devices. He felt the world was ready for new ideas as he saw the introduction of automation into factories during this time.

In 1954, Devol applied for patent on Programmed Article Transfer that introduced the concept of ''Universal Automation'' or [[Unimation]]; {{US Patent|2,988,237}} was issued in 1954. At the suggestion of Devol's wife, Evelyn, the word "Unimate" was coined to define the product, much the same as [[George Eastman]] had coined [[Kodak]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vidyaonline.org/arvindgupta/robot.pdf vidyaonline.org - robot]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Original Robot Patent.jpg|thumb|140px|right|U.S. Patent 2,988,237, issued in 1961 to Devol.]]
When he filed the patent for a programmable method for transferring articles, he wrote, "the present invention makes available for the first time a more or less general purpose machine that has universal application to a vast diversity of applications where cyclic digital control is desired."

After applying for this seminal patent&amp;nbsp;— which had not a single prior citation&amp;nbsp;— Devol searched for a company willing to give him financial backing to develop his programmable articles transfer system.  He talked with many major corporations in the [[United States]] during his search.  Through family connections, Devol obtained an audience with a partner in the firm Manning, Maxwell and Moore.  Joseph F. Engelberger, at that time, was chief of engineering in the aircraft products division at [[Manning, Maxwell and Moore]] in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. Engelberger was very interested, and Devol agreed to license Manning, Maxwell and Moore his patent and some future patents in the field.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;''Handbook of Design, Manufacturing and Automation'' by Richard C. Dorf and Andrew Kusiak (Wiley-IEEE) Page 260 {{ISBN|978-0-471-55218-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Manning, Maxwell and Moore was sold that year and its aircraft division is to be closed.

This development prompted Engelberger to seek a backer to buy out the aircraft division and found one in Consolidated Diesel Electronic (Condec), which agreed to put up the financing for the continued development of the robot. This new Condec division was called Unimation Incorporated with [[Joseph Engelberger]] as its president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robotics.utexas.edu/rrg/learn_more/history/ Robotics Research Group - The first robot: "Unimate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308080622/http://www.robotics.utexas.edu/rrg/learn_more/history/ |date=2008-03-08 }}, [[University of Texas]]. Accessed August 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Unimate prototypes were controlled by vacuum tubes used as digital switches though later versions used [[transistor]]s. Further, the "[[Off-the-shelf component|off-the-shelf]]" parts available in the late 1950s, such as digital encoders, were not adequate for the Unimate's purpose, and as a result, with Devol's guidance and a team of skilled engineers, Unimation designed and machined practically every part in the first Unimates.  Devol also invented a variety of new technologies, including a unique rotating [[drum memory]] system with data parity controls.

In 1960, Devol personally sold the first [[Unimate]] robot, which was shipped in 1961 to [[General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1086638/Unimate |title="Unimate."

[http://www.capitalcentury.com/1961.html "1961: A peep into the automated future"], ''[[The Trentonian]]''. Accessed August 11, 2011. "Without any fanfare, the world's first working robot joined the assembly line at the General Motors plant in Ewing Township in the spring of 1961.... It was an automated die-casting mold that dropped red-hot door handles and other such car parts into pools of cooling liquid on a line that moved them along to workers for trimming and buffing. Its most distinct feature was a grip on a steel armature that eliminated the need for a man to touch car parts just made from molten steel."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon companies such as [[Chrysler]], [[Ford]], and [[Fiat]] saw the necessity for large Unimate purchases.

Approximately $5 million was spent to develop the first Unimate{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. In 1966, after many years of market surveys and field tests, full-scale production began in Connecticut. Unimation's first production robot was a materials handling robot and was soon followed by robots for welding and other applications.

In 1975, Unimation showed its first profit. In 1978, the PUMA ([[Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly]]) robot was developed by Unimation from Vicarm ([[Victor Scheinman]]) and with support from General Motors.

In 2005, [[Popular Mechanics]] magazine selected Devol's Unimate as one of the Top 50 Inventions of the Past 50 Years.

==Additional work==

Devol later obtained patents on visual and tactile sensors for robots, coaxial connectors, non-refillable containers, and magnetostrictive manipulators or "micro robotics", a field he created.

'''The Harvard-MIT Data Center''' ('''HMDC''') provides multi-disciplinary information technology support for social science research and education at Harvard and MIT. Established in the early 1960s the HMDC was meant to be the original data center for political and social science at Harvard University, and over time it has evolved into an information technology service provider that transcends many educational fields.

==Services==
The HMDC offers the following services:
* Powerful, usable research computing tools
* Cluster computing power
* Application and server hosting
* On-site computer labs
* Statistical workshops and classes 
* User friendly desktop support

==History==
In the early 1960s the HMDC, originally known as the Government Data Center, was established as part of a national movement for all universities to collect, consolidate, and share social science research data. This movement eventually became known as the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), the largest collection of social science data in the world. In the early days associates of the Government Data Center were responsible for managing the distribution of ICPSR tapes housed in Harvard's Office of Information Technology. In 1987 all holdings within the facility were transferred to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Department of Government (located in Harvard's Littauer building) and in recognition of the widespread use of the facility's data by [[Harvard]] scholars the name was changed to the Harvard Data Center. At this time some of the earliest local computer networks, which contained statistical software and computing resources, were established; in addition, associates began transitioning the facility's holdings from tape to more modern media.  In the early 1990s associates of the Harvard Data Center played a major role in a [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) grant that established a research training program in political economy for various educational institutions. Later on, in 1996, facility associates entered into an agreement with [[MIT]] to extend services to MIT users, thus changing the name to the Harvard-MIT Data Center (HMDC). In 1999 HMDC associates were awarded a multimillion dollar grant by the NSF and five other funding agencies to create an open-source, digital library for quantitative research data; associates of the facility continue to receive additional grants and funding support from vendors, such as the NSF and the [[Library of Congress]], to continue their research and development projects. In 2005, after the facility was transferred into Harvard's new Center for Government and International Studies complex, the HMDC became a founding member of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS), and in 2007 HMDC associates launched their new online data center, the Dataverse Network repository. Today, the HMDC continues to serve the social science community by providing technology support for research, education, and administration.

'''Hidden innovation'''or '''Invisible innovation''' refers to [[innovation]] that is not captured or recognised by traditional indicators such as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) spending or number of [[patent]]s. The term generally refers to innovation that takes place outside science &amp; technology sectors, which are the primary sectors which invest in formal R&amp;D and patents. For example, although technological innovations are often developed in the oil &amp; gas sector through oil exploration activities, these innovations are unaccounted for in innovation metrics because oil exploration is not counted as formal R&amp;D. Other types of innovation, including [[social innovation]], can be classed as hidden innovation.

Although originally coined in the 90s by Diana Hicks and Sylvan Katz in their research on the hidden research system involving hospital researchers, and Mike Hopkins research on genetic testing within the UK healthcare system, the concept of hidden innovation has most recently been promoted by [[NESTA]], in their "Innovation Gap" Report, published October 2006. A later report, called "Hidden innovation", further expands on the concept and identifies four types of hidden innovation:

# Innovation that is the same or similar to activities that are measured by traditional indicators, but which is excluded from measurement.
# Innovation without a major scientific/technological basis, such as innovation in organizational forms or business models.
# Innovation created from the novel combination of existing technologies and processes.
# Locally developed, small-scale innovations that take place 'under the radar' and are therefore unrecognised or accounted for.

'''Holus''' is a [[holographic]] product under development by H+Technology. The concept was first developed in 2013, before funding via [[Kickstarter]] meant the product could be taken to market. The purpose of Holus is to simulate [[holographic]] experiences and is technically different from typical hologram stickers found on credit cards and currency notes.

Holus has been criticized by some commentators as a revamping [[Pepper's ghost]], a 19th-century optical trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@sableraph/how-to-sell-a-19th-century-parlor-trick-as-a-3d-holographic-display-c12a861cb8bf|title=Did Holus scam 200.000$ of Kickstarter backers using a 19th century parlor trick?|date=11 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/07/10/why-is-kickstarter-letting-a-h.html|title=Why is Kickstarter letting a hologram "scam" raise $250k?|first=Wrecksdart|last=Says|date=10 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Holus was developed in late 2013 by a team in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Gorey|first1 = Colm|title = The Holus tabletop hologram generator is now a reality|url = https://www.siliconrepublic.com/gear/2015/06/11/the-holus-tabletop-hologram-generator-is-now-a-reality|publisher = Silicon Republic|date = June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Holus Creates a New 3D Experience|url = http://smartreality.co/holus-creates-a-new-3d-experience/|publisher = SmartReality|date = September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before H+ Tech began looking for funding for the device, Holus won a number of awards for its design. This included he Vancouver User Experience Award in the non-profit category for partnering up with Ronald McDonald House to build Magic Room and the Peoples Choice Award to achieve excellence in joy, elegance, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Vancouver User Experience Awards winners announced|url = http://habaneroconsulting.com/about/news/vancouver-user-experience-awards-winners-announced|publisher = Habanero Consulting|date = December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first major coverage came from a review by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in early 2015. At the time, the technology was demonstrated to bring animals to life within the 3D glass box. The product was referred to in the review as roughly the "size of a microwave".&lt;ref name="mit2"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Metz|first1 = Rachel|title = Virtual Creatures in a Box, Controlled by You|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/535456/virtual-creatures-in-a-box-controlled-by-you/|publisher = [[MIT Technology Review]]|date = February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept went on to win two awards at the NextBC awards in [[Canada]] in early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = DigiBC - Digital Media &amp; Wireless in BC|url = http://www.digibc.org/cpages/blog|publisher = DigiBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to build mass versions of the product, a [[Kickstarter]] campaign was launched in order to take the idea to market. It used a similar technology to the [[optical illusion]] known as [[Pepper's ghost]]. This drew criticism from some during its [[Kickstarter]] campaign. It launched its [[Kickstarter]] campaign in June 2015 and generated twice its target of $40,000 within the first 48 hours.&lt;ref name="techcrunch2"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Tepper|first1 = Fitz|title = Holus Is A Tabletop Device That Turns Digital Media Into A 3D Hologram|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/10/holus-is-a-tabletop-device-that-turns-digital-media-into-a-3d-hologram/#.ry9hfw:AcpM|publisher = [[TechCrunch]]|date = June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology is similar to the technology used to display the music artists [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Usmar|first1 = Jo|title = Dead rapper Tupac is lined up for a tour after his Coachella Festival comeback|url = https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/weird-celeb-news/after-a-hologram-of-tupac-performs-at-coachella-797345|publisher = [[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]|date = April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the technology has advanced, with a number of [[startup company|startups]] entering the market. One of these was H+ Technology, who first began working on the technology in early 2013. The aim of the product at the time has remained the same until today, to produce 3D technology that can be used in the home on a tabletop.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Other reviews likened it to the technology used in the [[Star Wars]] films when the character [[R2-D2]] projected a [[hologram]] call on a small platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Griffiths|first1 = Sarah|title = The force is strong with this one! Star Wars-style 'holobox' creates virtual 3D worlds and lets you make hologram calls|url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3118591/The-force-strong-one-450-Star-Wars-style-holobox-creates-virtual-3D-worlds-lets-make-hologram-calls.html|publisher = [[Daily Mail]]|date = June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
Due to the technology being in its infancy, the media has covered the R&amp;D of the product and its potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive Holographic platform Holus, with 3D printing design options, successfully funded within hours |url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150611-interactive-holographic-platform-holus-with-3d-printing-design-options.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613192312/http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150611-interactive-holographic-platform-holus-with-3d-printing-design-options.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 13, 2015 |publisher=3ders |date=June 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spatial light modulator]]s have been mentioned as one potential development on future versions of Holus. The [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Simon Fraser University]] have both assisted with the research work of such displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = H+Technology breaks through crowdfunding goal on first day|url = https://www.ece.ubc.ca/news/201506/htechnology-breaks-through-crowdfunding-goal-first-day|publisher = [[University of Columbia]]|date = June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2342">'''Imperial Innovations''' is a UK technology commercialisation and investment company, based in London. Imperial Innovations is traded on the  [[Alternative Investment Market]] of the [[London Stock Exchange]].

==History==
Imperial Innovations was founded in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evers|first1=Natasha|last2=Cunningham|first2=James|title=Technology Entrepreneurship: Bringing Innovation to the Marketplace|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1137020116}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a department of [[Imperial College London]], later becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the College.

In July 2006, shares in the company were admitted to trading on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/college.asp?P=7996|website=Imperial College London|accessdate=30 October 2015|title=Imperial College London - Technology transfer company established by Imperial College London to float on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange ("AIM") (the "Flotation")}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, Imperial Innovations has raised over £300 million to invest in early-stage technology businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperialinnovations.co.uk/about/|accessdate=30 October 2015|title=About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2010 [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] revealed in a speech given in East London that Imperial Innovations had agreed to advise on the creation of an accelerator space for spinout companies at the [[Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park]] as part of the new [[East London Tech City]] hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-transcripts/2010/11/east-end-tech-city-speech-56602 |title=East End tech city speech |publisher=Number 10 |accessdate=4 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106161343/http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-transcripts/2010/11/east-end-tech-city-speech-56602 |archivedate=6 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paypal-IPN.gif|right|thumb|300px|Illustration of how IPN messages from PayPal works]]
'''Instant payment notification (IPN)''' is a method for online retailers to automatically track purchases and other server-to-server communication in real time.  This allows [[E-commerce]] systems the opportunity to store payment transactions, order information and other sales internally.  IPN messages can represent payment success or failures, order transaction status changes, accounting ledger information and many others depending on the [[payment gateway]]. &lt;ref name="paypal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/instant-payment-notification/ |title=Instant Payment Notification |publisher=PayPal|year=2018 |website=developer.paypal.com |access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The payments industry is an evolving market, technology like IPN and [[instant payment]] are now used in the retail market and in the domestic sphere, but they are expected to evolve into the corporate, B2B segment and cross-border space. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.swift.com/your-needs/instant-payments|title=Instant Payments |publisher=SWIFT|year=2018 |website=www.swift.com|access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it Works==
IPN is used by merchant to automate backend functions related to: the end user account creation, order tracking, customer and merchant notifications related to acquired services.
When an E-commerce system requests a resource from a payment gateway, like a new [[invoice]] or bill for goods, the request must contain a [[URL]] endpoint representing a script or program to handle returning notifications.  IPN messages are then sent to the retailer's E-commerce system by HTTP [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] as the resource is updated by the gateway. &lt;ref name="wepay"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.wepay.com/docs/articles/ipn |title=Instant Payment Notifications (IPN) |publisher=WePay|year=2018 |website=developer.wepay.com |access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPN handler usually performs standard actions like validating the message, updating inventory levels in the E-commerce system, notifying customers of successful or failed payments, etc.  Depending on the retailer's business requirements and the level of sophistication of the E-commerce software, some or all of the IPN messages can be handled or ignored. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pay.amazon.com/us/developer/documentation/lpwa/201985720 |title=Handling Instant Payment Notification (IPN) messages |publisher=Amazon|year=2018 |website=pay.amazon.com |access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Server-side scripting languages such as [[PHP]] and [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] that power most E-commerce systems are [[Event-driven architecture|event driven]] and make no distinction between a user-generated event or a machine-generated event.  Utilizing this fact, IPN messages facilitate the coordination of the order state changes between the ecommerce system and the payment gateway handling the order. &lt;ref name="paypal"/&gt; &lt;ref name="wepay"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33770">[[File:KTIW approach chart ILS RWY 17.svg|thumb|300px|An "[[approach plate]]" depicting an instrument approach procedure for an [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] approach to [[Tacoma Narrows Airport]] in the United States]]

In aviation, an '''instrument approach''' or '''instrument approach procedure''' ('''IAP''') is a series of predetermined maneuvers for the orderly transfer of an aircraft under [[instrument meteorological conditions|instrument flight conditions]] from the beginning of the initial approach to a landing or to a point from which a landing may be made visually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pilot/Controller Glossary |publisher=[[FAA]] |date=2016-05-26 |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/pcg.pdf |chapter=Instrument Approach Procedure |accessdate=2016-08-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729223257/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/media/PCG.pdf |archive-date=2016-07-29 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are approved in the United States by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] or the [[United States Department of Defense]] for the military. The [[ICAO]] defines an instrument approach as a series of predetermined maneuvers by reference to flight instruments with specific protection from obstacles from the initial approach fix, or where applicable, from the beginning of a defined arrival route to a point from which a landing can be completed and thereafter, if landing is not completed, to a position at which [[holding (aviation)|holding]] or enroute obstacle clearance criteria apply.&lt;ref name=AIM&gt;{{cite book |title=ASA's 2012 FAR and AIM Series |publisher=Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, Inc. |year=2011 |pages=1013 |isbn=9781560278580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three categories of instrument approach procedures: '''precision approach''' (PA), '''approach with vertical guidance''' (APV), and '''non-precision approach''' (NPA). A precision approach uses a navigation system that provides course and [[glidepath]] deviation. Examples include [[precision approach radar]] (PAR), [[instrument landing system]] (ILS), and [[Local Area Augmentation System|GBAS landing system]] (GLS). An approach with vertical guidance also uses a navigation system for course and glidepath deviation, just not to the same standards as a PA. Examples include [[VNAV|baro-VNAV]], [[localizer type directional aid]] (LDA) with glidepath, [[LNAV]]/VNAV and [[localizer performance with vertical guidance|LPV]]. A non-precision approach uses a navigation system for course deviation but does not provide glidepath information. These approaches include [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], [[non-directional beacon|NDB]] and LNAV. PAs and APVs are flown to a decision height/altitude (DH/DA), while non-precision approaches are flown to a minimum descent altitude (MDA).&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|757}}

'''IAP charts''' are [[aeronautical chart]]s that portray the aeronautical data that is required to execute an instrument approach to an airport. Besides depicting topographic features, hazards and obstructions, they depict the procedures and airport diagram. Each procedure chart uses a specific type of electronic navigation system such as an NDB, [[TACAN]], VOR, ILS/[[microwave landing system|MLS]] and [[RNAV]].&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|981–982}} The chart name reflects the primary [[navigational aid]] (NAVAID), if there is more than one straight-in procedure or if it is just a circling-only procedure. A communication strip on the chart lists frequencies in the order they are used. Minimum, maximum and mandatory altitudes are depicted in addition to the minimum safe altitude (MSA) for emergencies. A cross depicts the final approach fix (FAF) altitude on NPAs while a lightning bolt does the same for PAs. NPAs depict the MDA while a PA shows both the decision altitude (DA) and decision height (DH). Finally, the chart depicts the [[missed approach]] procedures in plan and profile view, besides listing the steps in sequence.&lt;ref name=FAA&gt;{{cite book |title=Instrument Procedures Handbook, FAA-H-8083-16A |publisher= Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, Inc. |year=2015 |at=pp. 4-9, 4-11, 4-19, 4-20, 4-41 |isbn=9781619543386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[satellite navigation]] was available for civilian aviation, the requirement for large land-based [[navigation aid]] (NAVAID) facilities generally limited the use of instrument approaches to land-based (i.e. asphalt, gravel, turf, ice) runways (and those on [[aircraft carrier]]s). [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]] technology allows, at least theoretically, to create instrument approaches to any point on the Earth's surface (whether on land or water); consequently, there are nowadays examples of water aerodromes (such as [[Rangeley Lake Seaplane Base]] in [[Maine]], United States) that have GNSS-based approaches.

==Instrument approach segments==
An instrument approach procedure may contain up to five separate segments, which depict course, distance, and minimum altitude. These segments are&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-43,4-53}}

* '''Feeder routes''': A route for aircraft to proceed from the en route structure to the [[initial approach fix|IAF]], which includes the course and bearing to be flown, the distance, and the minimum altitude.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-43}}
* '''Initial approach segment''': This segment provides a method for aligning the aircraft with the intermediate or final approach segment and to permit descent during the alignment. It begins at an IAF and ends at the intermediate approach segment or intermediate fix (IF). A [[distance measuring equipment|DME]] arc, a procedure turn, or holding pattern may be involved or the terminal route may simply intersect the final approach course.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-50}} 
* '''Intermediate approach segment''': This segment positions the aircraft for the final descent to the airport. It begins at the IF and ends at the final approach segment.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-53}}
* '''Final approach segment''': For a PA or APV, this segment starts where the glideslope intercepts altitude plane. For an NPA, this segment starts at the FAF, final approach point (FAP), or where the aircraft is established on the final approach course. This segment ends at either the designated [[missed approach point]] (MAP) or upon landing.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-53}}
* '''Missed approach segment''': This segment starts at the MAP and ends at a point or fix where the initial or en route segment begins.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-54}}

When an aircraft is under [[radar control]], [[air traffic control]] (ATC) may replace some or all of these phases of the approach with radar vectors (ICAO radar vectoring is the provision of navigational guidance to aircraft in the form of specific headings, based on the use of radar).&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|1033}} ATC will use an imaginary "approach gate" when vectoring aircraft to the final approach course. This gate will be 1 [[nautical mile]] (NM) from the FAF and at least 5 NM from the landing threshold. Outside radar environments, the instrument approach starts at the IAF.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-54,4-56}}

==Types of approaches==
Though ground-based NAVAID approaches still exist, the FAA is transitioning to approaches which are satellite-based (RNAV). Additionally, in lieu of the published approach procedure, a flight may continue as an [[IFR]] flight to landing while increasing the efficiency of the arrival with either a contact or visual approach.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-57}}

===Visual approach===
A visual approach is an ATC authorization for an aircraft on an IFR flight plan to proceed visually to the airport of intended landing; it is not an instrument approach procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc/atc0704.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208052714/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/atc/atc0704.html |archivedate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visual approach may be requested by the pilot or offered by ATC. Visual approaches are possible when weather conditions permit continuous visual contact with the destination airport. They are issued in such weather conditions in order to expedite handling of IFR traffic. The ceiling must be reported or expected to be at least 1000 feet AGL ([[above ground level]]) and the visibility is at least 3 [[mile|SM]] (statute miles).&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-57}}

A pilot may accept a visual approach clearance as soon as the pilot has the destination airport in sight. According to ICAO Doc. 4444, it is enough for a pilot to see the terrain to accept a visual approach. The point is that if a pilot is familiar with the terrain in the vicinity of the airfield he/she may easily find the way to the airport having the surface in sight. 
ATC must ensure that weather conditions at the airport are above certain minima (in the U.S., a ceiling of 1000 feet AGL or greater and visibility of at least 3 statute miles) before issuing the clearance. According to ICAO Doc. 4444, it is enough if the pilot reports that in his/her opinion the weather conditions allow a visual approach to be made. In general, the ATC gives the information about the weather but it's the pilot who makes a decision if the weather is suitable for landing. Once the pilot has accepted the clearance, he/she assumes responsibility for separation and wake turbulence avoidance and may navigate as necessary to complete the approach visually. According to ICAO Doc. 4444, ATC continues to provide separation between the aircraft making a visual approach and other arriving and departing aircraft. The pilot may get responsible for the separation with preceding aircraft in case he/she has the preceding aircraft in sight and is instructed so by ATC.
In the United States, it is required that an aircraft have the airport, the runway, or the preceding aircraft in sight.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-57}} It is not enough to have the terrain in sight (see [[#Contact approach]]).&lt;ref name="faa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0505.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303040850/http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/AIM/aim0505.html |archivedate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a pilot accepts a visual approach, the pilot accepts responsibility for establishing a safe landing interval behind the preceding aircraft, as well as responsibility for wake-turbulence avoidance, and to remain clear of clouds.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-57}}&lt;ref name="faa.gov"/&gt;

===Contact approach===
A contact approach that may be asked for by the pilot (but not offered by ATC) in which the pilot has 1 SM flight visibility and is clear of clouds and is expected to be able to maintain those conditions all the way to the airport. Obstruction clearances and VFR traffic avoidance become the pilot's responsibility.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-58}}&lt;ref name="faa.gov"/&gt;

===Charted visual flight procedures (CVFP)===
A visual approach that has a specified route the aircraft is to follow to the airport. Pilots must have a charted visual landmark or a preceding aircraft in sight, and weather must be at or above the published minimums. Pilots are responsible for maintaining a safe approach interval and [[wake turbulence]] separation.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-58}}

===RNAV approach===
These approaches include both ground-based and satellite-based systems and include criteria for terminal areas (TAAs), basic approach criteria, and final approach criteria. The TAA is a transition from the en route structure to the terminal environment which provides minimum altitudes for obstacle clearance. The TAA is a "T" or "basic T" design with left and right [[base leg]] IAFs on initial approach segments perpendicular to the intermediate approach segment where there is a dual purpose IF/IAF for a straight-in procedure (no procedure turn [NoPT]), or hold-in-lieu-of procedure-turn (HILO) course reversal. The base leg IAFs is 3 to 6 NM from the IF/IAF. The basic-T is aligned with the runway centerline, with the IF 5 NM from the FAF, and the FAF is 5 NM from the threshold.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-58,4-60,4-61}}

The RNAV approach chart will have four lines of approach minimums corresponding to LPV, LNAV/VNAV, LNAV, and Circling.  This allows GPS or WAAS equipped aircraft to use the LNAV MDA using GPS only, if WAAS becomes unavailable.&lt;ref name="FAAB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Instrument Procedures Handbook, FAA-H-8083-16B |date=2017 |publisher=US Dept. of Transportation, FAA Flight Standards Service |page=4-26 |url=https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/instrument_procedures_handbook/media/FAA-H-8083-16B.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ILS approach===
These are the most precise and accurate approaches. A runway with an ILS can accommodate 29 arrivals per hour.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-64}} ILS systems on two or three runways increase capacity with parallel (dependent) ILS, simultaneous parallel (independent) ILS, [[precision runway monitor]] (PRM), and converging ILS approaches. ILS approaches have three classifications, CAT I, CAT II, and CAT III. CAT II and CAT III require additional certification for operators, pilots, aircraft and equipment, with CAT III used mainly by air carriers and the military. Simultaneous parallel approaches require runway centerlines to be between 4,300 and 9,000 feet apart, plus a "dedicated final monitor controller" to monitor aircraft separation. Simultaneous close parallel (independent) PRM approaches must have runways separation to be between 3,400 and 4,300 feet. Simultaneous offset instrument approaches (SOIAs) apply to runways separated by 750–3,000 feet. A SOIA uses an ILS/PRM on one runway and an LDA/PRM with glideslope for the other.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-64,4-65,4-66}}

===VOR approach===
These approaches use VOR facilities on and off the airport and may be supplemented with DME and TACAN.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-69}}

===NDB approach===
These approaches use NDB facilities on and off the airport and may be supplemented with a DME.  These approaches are gradually being phased out.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-69,4-72}}

===Radar approach===
This will be either a [[precision approach radar]] (PAR) or an [[airport surveillance radar]] (ASR) approach. Information is published in tabular form. The PAR provides vertical and lateral guidance plus range. The ASR only provides heading and range information.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-72,4-75}}

===Localizer approach===
These approaches include a [[instrument landing system localizer|localizer]] approach, localizer/DME approach, localizer back course approach, and a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). In cases where an ILS is installed, a back course may be available in conjunction with the localizer. Reverse sensing occurs on the back course using standard VOR equipment. With a [[horizontal situation indicator]] (HSI) system, reverse sensing is eliminated if it is set appropriately to the front course.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-76,4-78}}

===Simplified directional facility (SDF) approach===
This type of approach is similar to the ILS localizer approach, but with less precise guidance.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-78}}

==Non-precision approaches and systems==
Non-precision systems provide lateral guidance (that is, heading information), but do not provide vertical guidance (i.e., altitude and/or glidepath guidance).
* [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR)
* [[Tactical air navigation]] (TACAN)
* [[Non-directional beacon]] (NDB) – ground-based transmitter for aircraft equipped with an [[Automatic Direction Finder]] (ADF).
* [[Simplified directional facility]] (SDF)
* [[Satellite navigation]] systems, such as the American [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS). [[LNAV]] and [[LNAV]]/[[VNAV]] approaches require [[Receiver autonomous integrity monitoring]] (RAIM) which detects problems with GPS satellites. [[Localizer performance with vertical guidance|LPV]] (Localiser Performance with Vertical guidance) and LP (without vertical guidance) do not require RAIM since they utilise [[SBAS]] correcting signal like [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) or [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS).
* [[Required navigation performance]] (RNP) – a system that utilizes on-board performance monitoring through the aircraft's [[flight management system]]
* [[Localizer]]
* [[Localizer type directional aid]] (LDA)
* [[Surveillance radar approach]] (SRA) – also known in some countries as an ASR approach
* [[Airport surveillance radar]] (ASR) – military designation for SRA

==Basic concepts defined==

===Decision height or altitude (used on precision approaches)===
[[File:Decision altitude and decision height.svg|thumb|Illustration of DA and DH]]
&lt;!--DH and DA link to this section – so make sure to fix the links if you are changing the section title--&gt;

ICAO defines decision altitude/decision height as a specified altitude or height (A/H) in the precision approach at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|1000}}&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-20}} A decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA) is a specified lowest [[height]] or [[altitude]] in the approach descent at which, if the required visual reference to continue the approach (such as the runway markings or runway environment) is not visible to the pilot, the pilot must initiate a [[missed approach]]. The specific values for DH and/or DA at a given airport are established with intention to allow a pilot sufficient time to safely re-configure an aircraft to climb and execute the missed approach procedures while avoiding terrain and obstacles. A DH/DA denotes the altitude in which a missed approach procedure must be started, it does not preclude the aircraft from descending below the prescribed DH/DA. A decision height is measured AGL (above ground level) while a decision altitude is measured above MSL (mean sea level). They are used for precision approaches.

===Minimum descent altitude{{anchor|Minimum descent altitude}} (MDA) (used on non-precision approaches)===
[[File:MDA and MDH.svg|thumb|Illustration of minimum descent altitude during a non-precision approach]]
The minimum descent altitude (MDA) is the lowest altitude, expressed in feet above mean sea level, to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|1019}}&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-19}}&lt;ref name='FAA-H-8083-15'&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/FAA-H-8083-15B.pdf |title=Instrument Flying Handbook |publisher=[[FAA]] |year=2012 |page=G-12 |format=pdf |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with DH or DA, a missed approach need not be initiated immediately upon reaching the altitude. A pilot flying a non-precision approach may descend to the MDA and maintain it until reaching the [[missed approach point]] (MAP), then initiate a missed approach if the required visual reference was not obtained. An aircraft must not descend below the MDA until visual reference is obtained, and which the aircraft can land while performing normal maneuvers, which differs slightly from a DH/DA in that while the missed approach procedure must be initiated at or prior to the DH/DA, because of its vertical momentum, during a precision approach an aircraft may end up descending slightly below the DH/DA during the course of the missed approach.

If a runway has both precision and non-precision approaches defined, the MDA of the non-precision approach is almost always greater than the DH/DA of the precision approach, because of the lack of vertical guidance on the non-precision approach: the actual difference depends on the accuracy of the navaid upon which the approach is based, with ADF approaches and SRAs tending to have the highest MDAs.

===Straight-in approach IFR===
An instrument approach wherein final approach is begun without first having executed a procedure turn, not necessarily completed with a straight-in landing or made to straight-in landing minimums.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|1041}} A direct instrument approach requires no procedure turn or any other course reversal procedures for alignment (usually indicated by "NoPT" on approach plates), as the arrival direction and the final approach course are not too different from each other. The direct approach can be finished with a straight-in landing or circle-to-land procedure.

===Course reversal procedure===
[[File:Procedure turns.gif|thumb|160px|A "procedure turn" maneuver, showing two commonly used variations in the way it may be performed by a pilot.]]
Some approach procedures do not permit straight-in approaches unless the pilots are being radar vectored. In these situations, pilots are required to complete a procedure turn (PT) or other course reversal, generally within 10 NM of the PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate or final approach segment.&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-49}} When conducting any type of approach, if the aircraft is not lined up for a straight-in approach, then a course reversal might be necessary. The idea of a course reversal is to allow sufficiently large changes in the course flown (in order to line the aircraft up with the final approach course), without taking too much space horizontally and while remaining within the confines of protected airspace. This is accomplished in one of three ways: a procedure turn, a holding pattern, or a teardrop course reversal.
;Procedure turn (PT): ICAO defines a PT as a maneuver in which a turn is made away from a designated track followed by a turn in the opposite direction to permit the aircraft to intercept and proceed along the reciprocal of the designated track.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|775,1030}}&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-49}} A standardized way of reversing course to get lined up for final approach. The approach chart must indicate that a procedure turn is authorized for the approach, via a "procedure turn barb" symbol or a similar notation. Note that when a procedure turn exists for an approach, the maximum speed of the aircraft in the procedure turn is limited by regulations (typically, it should not exceed 200 knots IAS). The procedure turn is typically entered by tracking a navaid course outbound (usually following a reciprocal of the inbound course), and then turning 45° off of the course; after that, the pilot flies this leg for a certain time, then conducts a 180° turn to get on a 45° intercepting course, and then re-intercepts the inbound course.
;Hold in lieu of procedure turn: It is established over a final or intermediate fix when an approach can be made from a properly aligned holding pattern. It is a required maneuver, as is a PT, unless the aircraft is being radar vectored to the final approach course, when 'NoPT' is shown on the approach chart, or when the pilot requests or the controller advises the pilot to make a 'straight-in' approach.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|775,1011}}&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-50}} This maneuver is commonly referred to as the racetrack pattern. It is another method of course reversal, but it can also be used for losing altitude within protected airspace. A holding pattern used for this purpose is depicted in U.S. government publications as the "hold-in-lieu-of-PT" holding pattern symbol. The procedure has two parallel legs, with 180° turns between them.
;Teardrop procedure or penetration turn: The teardrop procedure consists of departure from an initial approach fix on an outbound course followed by a turn toward and intercepting the inbound course at or prior to the intermediate fix or point.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|775}} If the controlled airspace is extremely limited, a teardrop may be used to reverse the direction of the aircraft and permit the aircraft to lose altitude. This procedure is shaped like a teardrop, hence the name. It typically consists of the outbound course flown at 30° angle to the reciprocal of the inbound course, and then making a 210° turn to intercept the inbound course.

===Circle-to-land maneuver===
Circle-to-land is a maneuver initiated by the pilot to align the aircraft with a runway for landing when a straight-in landing from an instrument approach is not possible or is not desirable, and only after ATC authorization has been obtained and the pilot has established and maintains required visual reference to the airport.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|994}}&lt;ref name=FAA/&gt;{{rp|4-11}} A circle-to-land maneuver is an alternative to a straight-in landing. It is a maneuver used when a runway is not aligned within 30 degrees of the final approach course of the instrument approach procedure or the final approach requires 400 feet (or more) of descent per nautical mile, and therefore requires some visual maneuvering of the aircraft in the vicinity of the airport after the instrument portion of the approach is completed to align the aircraft with the runway for landing.

It is very common for a circle-to-land maneuver to be executed during a straight-in approach to a different runway, e.g., an ILS approach to one runway, followed by a low-altitude transition, ending in a landing on another (not necessarily parallel) runway. This way, approach procedures to one runway can be used to land on any runway at the airport, as the other runways might lack instrument procedures or their approaches cannot be used for other reasons (traffic considerations, navigation aids being out of service, etc.).

Circling to land is considered more difficult and less safe than a straight-in landing, especially under [[instrument meteorological conditions]] because the aircraft is at a low altitude and must remain within a short distance from the airport in order to be assured of obstacle clearance (often within a couple of miles, even for faster aircraft). The pilot must maintain visual contact with the airport at all times; loss of visual contact requires execution of a missed approach procedure.

Pilots should be aware that there are significant differences in obstacle clearance criteria between procedures designed in accordance with ICAO PANS-OPS and US TERPS. This is especially true in respect of circling approaches where the assumed radius of turn and minimum obstacle clearance are markedly different.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Circling_Approach_-_difference_between_ICAO_PANS-OPS_and_US_TERPS Circling Approach – difference between ICAO PANS-OPS and US TERPS, SKYbrary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=8260.3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PANS-OPS /&gt;

===Sidestep maneuver===
A visual maneuver by a pilot performed at the completion of an instrument approach to permit a straight-in landing on a parallel runway not more than 1,200 feet to either side of the runway to which the instrument approach was conducted.&lt;ref name=AIM/&gt;{{rp|793–795,1038}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uonqrGA5GbEC|title=Aeronautical Dictionary: With Emphasis on ATC Communications Terms|last=Balter|first=J. Deborah|date=2004-01-01|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=9781412008655|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rate-of-descent formula===
A useful formula pilots use to calculate descent rates (for the standard 3° glide slope):

: ''Rate of descent = ground speed ⁄ 2 × 10''
or
: ''Rate of descent = ground speed × 5''
For other glideslope angles:
: ''Rate of descent = glide slope angle × ground speed × 100 / 60'',
where rate of descent is in feet per minute, and ground speed is in [[knot (unit)|knots]].

The latter replaces ''tan α'' (see below) with ''α/60'', which has an error of about 5% up to 10°.

'''Example:'''
 ''  120 kn × 5
 '''  or'''
 ''  120 kn / 2 × 10
 ''
 ''= 600 ft/min

The simplified formulas above are based on a [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] calculation:

: ''Rate of descent = ground speed × 101.27 × tan α''

where:

*''α'' is the descent or glideslope angle from the horizontal (3° being the standard)
*''101.27'' (&lt;sup&gt;ft/min&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;kn&lt;/sub&gt;) is the conversion factor from [[Knot (unit)|knots]] to feet per minute (1 knot = 1 &lt;sup&gt;[[Nautical mile|NM]]&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 6076 &lt;sup&gt;ft&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 101.27&amp;nbsp;ft/min)
'''Example:'''
 ''Ground speed = 120 kn
 ''           α = 3°
 ''
 ''  120 kn × 101.27&lt;sup&gt;ft/min&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;kn&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; × tan 3°
 ''
 ''≈ 640&amp;nbsp;ft/min

==Airport requirements==
Special considerations for low visibility operations include improved lighting for the approach area, runways, and taxiways, and the location of emergency equipment. There must be redundant electrical systems so that in the event of a power failure, the back-up takes over operation of the required airport instrumentation (e.g., the ILS and lighting). [[Critical area|ILS critical areas]] must be free from other aircraft and vehicles to avoid [[Critical area#Multipathing|multipathing]].

In the United States, the requirements and the standards for establishing instrument approaches at an airport are contained in the FAA Order 8260.3 "United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)".&lt;ref name=8260.3&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/FAA_Order_8260.3C.pdf |title=Order 8260.3C "United States Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS)" |publisher=[[FAA]] |date=2016-03-14 |accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ICAO]] publishes requirements in the ICAO Doc 8168 "Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Aircraft Operations (PANS-OPS), Volume II: Construction of Visual and Instrument Flight Procedures".&lt;ref name=PANS-OPS&gt;{{cite book |url=http://dcaa.trafikstyrelsen.dk:8000/icaodocs/Doc%208168%20-%20Aircraft%20Operations/Volume%202%20-%20Construction%20of%20Visual%20and%20Instrument%20Flight%20Procedures.pdf |title=Procedures for Air Navigation Services – Aircraft Operations (PANS-OPS), Volume II: Construction of Visual and Instrument Flight Procedures |format=pdf |publisher=[[ICAO]] |year=2006 |edition=5th |accessdate=2013-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160519021503/http://dcaa.trafikstyrelsen.dk:8000/icaodocs/Doc%208168%20-%20Aircraft%20Operations/Volume%202%20-%20Construction%20of%20Visual%20and%20Instrument%20Flight%20Procedures.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountain airports such as [[Reno–Tahoe International Airport]] (KRNO) offer significantly different instrument approaches for aircraft landing on the same runway, but from opposite directions. Aircraft approaching from the north must make visual contact with the airport at a higher altitude than a flight approaching from the south, because of rapidly rising terrain south of the airport.&lt;ref&gt;See approach plates for "LOC RWY 16R", "ILS RWY 16R" and "ILS or LOC/DME RWY 34L" approaches at KRNO.&lt;/ref&gt; This higher altitude allows a flight crew to clear the obstacle if a landing is not feasible. In general, each specific instrument approach specifies the minimum weather conditions that must be present in order for the landing to be made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1742">The '''Love chair''' (French '''''Siege d'amour''''') was a device created by a French furniture manufacturer in the early 20th century to allow the corpulent British King [[Edward VII]] to have sex with two or more women simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Hof2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Hof|title=Two Edwards: How King Edward VII and Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey Fomented the First World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8VVDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30|date=1 May 2018|publisher=Trine Day|isbn=978-1-63424-175-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dirty Bertie: How Royal playboy took Victorian Paris by storm with a THREE-WAY love seat|author=Rebecca Perring|work=Express|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/610974/Prince-Bertie-three-way-love-seat-Paris-lust-Royal-Prince-of-Wales-playboy|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chair was first created by the [[Soubrier]] furniture manufacturer, which has now (as of 2018) become the current owner of the device.   The King's waist measured 48&amp;nbsp;inches (122&amp;nbsp;cm) shortly before his coronation&lt;ref&gt;Middlemas, p. 200 and Hattersley, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; at which point the practice of visiting brothels may have stopped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Twister|title=There Once Was A Man With Six Wives: Our Kings and Queens in Limericks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ0kDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT184|date=2017-02-16|publisher=Pavilion Books|isbn=978-1-911042-85-3|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this, however, the King was a regular visitor at ''[[Le Chabanais]]'' in Paris, a French brothel, and the chair was designed specifically for the King's visits there.  The chair allowed him to indulge his sexual fantasies without crushing his female partners.

Conway is notable for a number of pioneering achievements, including the [[Mead &amp; Conway revolution]] in [[VLSI]] design, which incubated an emerging [[electronic design automation]] industry. She worked at [[IBM]] in the 1960s and is credited with the invention of generalized dynamic instruction handling, a key advance used in [[out-of-order execution]], used by most modern [[central processing unit|computer processors]] to improve performance.&lt;ref name=smoth01/&gt;&lt;ref name=HP01&gt;[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Media/HP/HP.html "Embracing Diversity – HP employees in Fort Collins, Colorado, welcome Dr. Lynn Conway"], hpNOW, February 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneeraward&gt;[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/awards/conway "Lynn Conway: 2009 Computer Pioneer Award Recipient"], IEEE Computer Society, January 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneers&gt;[http://www.computer.org/portal/web/pressroom/2010/pioneer "Computer Society Names Computer Pioneers"], IEEE Computer Society, January 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneersawardvideo&gt;{{YouTube|i4Txvjia3p0|"IEEE Computer Society Video: Lynn Conway receives 2009 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award"}}, July 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=superproj60a&gt;[http://computerhistorymuseum.createsend5.com/T/ViewEmail/r/5905148A596C2B2D/76449239DC84823AC5EC08CADFFC107B "Event: IBM ACS System: A Pioneering Supercomputer Project of the 1960s"], Computer History Museum, February 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=superproj60b&gt;[http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?id=1264112339 "Computer History Museum Events: IBM ACS System: A Pioneering Supercomputer Project of the 1960s"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928064740/http://www.computerhistory.org/events/index.php?id=1264112339 |date=September 28, 2012 }}, Computer History Museum, February 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBMsmotherman&gt;[http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/12/102128-ibms-single-processor-supercomputer-efforts/fulltext "Historical Reflections: IBM's Single-Processor Supercomputer Efforts - Insights on the pioneering IBM Stretch and ACS projects" by M.

==Early life and education==

Conway grew up in [[White Plains, New York]]. Conway was shy and experienced [[gender dysphoria]] as a child. She became fascinated and engaged by [[astronomy]] (building a {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} reflector telescope one summer) and did well in math and science in high school. Conway entered [[MIT]] in 1955, earning high grades but ultimately leaving in despair after an attempted [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]] in 1957–58 failed due to the medical climate at the time. After working as an electronics technician for several years, Conway resumed education at [[Columbia University]]'s School of Engineering and Applied Science, earning B.S. and M.S.E.E. degrees in 1962 and 1963.&lt;ref name=conI&gt;Lynn Conway, "[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Retrospective1.html Lynn Conway's Retrospective Part I: Childhood and education]," February 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kilbane/&gt;

==Early research at IBM==

Conway was recruited by [[IBM]] Research in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]] in 1964, and was soon selected to join the [[computer architecture|architecture]] team designing an advanced [[supercomputer]], working alongside [[John Cocke]], Herbert Schorr, [[Ed Sussenguth]], [[Fran Allen]] and other IBM researchers on the [[ACS-1|Advanced Computing Systems]] (ACS) project, inventing multiple-issue out-of-order dynamic instruction scheduling while working there.&lt;ref name=smoth01&gt;{{cite web | title = IBM Advanced Computing Systems (ACS) – 1961–1969 | author = Mark Smotherman | url = http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/acs.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneeraward/&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneers/&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneersawardvideo/&gt;&lt;ref name=superproj60a/&gt;&lt;ref name=superproj60b/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBMsmotherman/&gt;&lt;ref name=sciam00&gt;Paul Wallich, "[http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=D1E5F66F-2A45-4BF9-BE9E-001B49F7F67 Profile: Lynn Conway—Completing the Circuit]," Scientific American, December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCnews01&gt;Dianne Lynch,  "[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Media/ABC%20NEWS/ABCNEWS_com%20%20Wired%20Women%20Engineer%20Lynn%20Conway%27s%20Secret.htm The Secret Behind 'Project Y': One Woman's Success Story — 'What Works, Works']", ABCNews.com, November 29, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chm_ibm_acs_reunion&gt;{{cite web | title = IBM ACS Reunion – February 18, 2010, in California | author = Mark Smotherman | url = http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/acs_reunion.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chm_ibm_acs_video&gt;{{cite web | title = The IBM ACS System: A Pioneering Supercomputer Project – Video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pod53_F6urQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Computer History Museum has stated that "the ACS machines appears to have been the first [[superscalar]] design, a computer architectural paradigm widely exploited in modern high-performance microprocessors."&lt;ref name=comsocpioneeraward/&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneers/&gt;&lt;ref name=comsocpioneersawardvideo/&gt;&lt;ref name=superproj60a/&gt;&lt;ref name=superproj60b/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBMsmotherman/&gt;&lt;ref name=chm_ibm_acs_reunion/&gt;&lt;ref name=chm_ibm_acs_video/&gt;

==Gender transition==
After learning of the pioneering research of [[Harry Benjamin]] in treating [[transsexual]]s&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Historically correct to use "transsexual", not "transgendered" in describing Harry Benjamin's work. --&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and realising that genital affirmation surgery was now possible, Conway sought his help and became his patient. After suffering from severe [[Clinical depression|depression]] from [[gender dysphoria]], Conway contacted Benjamin, who agreed to providing counseling and prescribe [[Hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormones]]. Under Benjamin's care, Conway began her [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].&lt;ref name=hiltzik&gt;Hiltzik, Michael A. (November 19, 2000.)

While struggling with life in a male role,&lt;ref name=hiltzik/&gt; Conway had been married to a woman and had two children. Under the legal constraints then in place, after transitioning she was denied access to their children.&lt;ref name=hiltzik/&gt;

Although she had hoped to be allowed to transition on the job, IBM fired Conway in 1968 after she revealed her intention to transition&lt;ref name="Conway2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conway|first=Lynn|year=2012|title=Reminiscences of the VLSI revolution: How a series of failures triggered a paradigm shift in digital design|journal=IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine|publisher=IEEE|volume=4|issue=4|pages=8–31|issn=1943-0582|doi=10.1109/MSSC.2012.2215752|url=http://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/articles/2013/VLSI_Reminiscences.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a female [[gender role]].

==Career as computer scientist==
Upon completing her [[Transitioning (transgender)|transition]] in 1968, Conway took a new name and identity, and restarted her career in "[[Stealth (transgender)|stealth-mode]]" as a contract programmer at Computer Applications, Inc. She went on to work at [[Memorex]] during 1969–1972 as a digital system designer and computer architect.&lt;ref name=hiltzik/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Retrospective3.html |title=Lynn Conway's Retrospective PART III: Starting Over |publisher=Ai.eecs.umich.edu |date=May 12, 1960 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway joined [[Xerox PARC]] in 1973, where she led the "[[Large Scale Integration|LSI]] Systems" group under [[Bert Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = About This Issue... | author = Adele J.

In 1978, Conway served as visiting associate professor of [[Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science|EECS]] at [[MIT]], teaching a now famous [[VLSI| VLSI design]] course based on a draft of the Mead–Conway text.&lt;ref name=hiltzik/&gt; The course validated the new design methods and textbook, and established the syllabus and instructor's guidebook used in later courses all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/VLSI/InstGuide/InstGuide.pdf ''The MIT'78 VLSI System Design Course: A Guidebook for the Instructor of VLSI System Design''], Lynn Conway, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, August 12, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=penfield&gt;Paul Penfield [http://issuu.com/miteecs/docs/connector2014_acc15802878d20 "The VLSI Revolution at MIT" by Paul Penfield] ''2014 MIT EECS Connector'', Spring 2014, pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Conway left Xerox to join [[DARPA]], where she was a key architect of the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]]'s [[Strategic Computing Initiative]], a research program studying high-performance computing, [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous system]]s technology, and intelligent weapons technology.&lt;ref name=kilbane&gt;Kilbane, Doris.

In a ''[[USA Today]]'' article about Conway's joining DARPA, Mark Stefik, a Xerox scientist who worked with her, said "Lynn would like to live five lives in the course of one life" and that she's "charismatic and very energetic".&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Memoirs/DARPA/USA_Today_6-07-83.pdf "Hi-tech resarcher chips in to develop smart computer"], Michelle Osborn, USA Today, June 7, 1983, p. 3B.&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Fairbairn, a former Xerox associate, said "She figures out a way so that everybody wins."&lt;ref name=Osborn/&gt;

(In response to critics, she has said, 'if you have to fight, and sometimes you must in order to deal with bad people, history tells us that it really helps to have the best weapons available)".&lt;ref name=conI/&gt; But Conway carried a sense of computers as tools for horizontal communications that she had absorbed at PARC right into [[DARPA]] - at one of the hottest moments of the cold war."

Conway joined the [[University of Michigan]] in 1985 as professor of [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]], and associate dean of engineering. There she worked on "visual communications and control probing for basic system and user-interface concepts as applicable to hybridized internet/broadband-cable communications".&lt;ref name=kilbane/&gt; She retired from active teaching and research in 1998, as [[Professor emeritus#Other designations|professor emerita]] at Michigan.&lt;ref name=emerita&gt;[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/Awards/Emerita.html "Lynn Conway awarded Emerita status at the University of Michigan"], December 31, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

"Clearly a new paradigm had emerged . . . Importantly, imaginative support in terms of infrastructure and idea dissemination proved as valuable as the concepts, tools, and chips.

According to Dreger, as Bailey did not receive compensation for his services, he would not have needed a license in Illinois, and was "completely forthright in his letters supporting the women, both about the fact that he had only had brief conversations with them (as opposed to having provided them with extensive counseling) and about his own qualifications and expertise...[and] even attached copies of his CV."

[[File:Sinclair MTV-1 Front.jpg|thumb|Front view of Sinclair MTV-1]]
[[File:Sinclair MTV-1B.jpg|thumb|Sinclair MTV-1B]]

The '''MTV-1 Micro TV''' was the second model of a [[handheld television|near pocket-sized]] [[television]]. The first was the Panasonic IC model TR-001 introduced in 1970. The MTV-1 was developed by [[Clive Sinclair]] (Sinclair Radionics Ltd). It was shown to the public at [[trade show]]s in [[London]] and [[Chicago]] in January, 1977, and released for sale in 1978. Development spanned 10 years and included a cash infusion of {{GBP|1.6 million|link=yes}} (about {{USD|2.9 million}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) from the UK government in 1976.

The MTV-1 used a [[Germany|German]] [[Telefunken|AEG Telefunken]] {{convert|2|inch|cm|adj=on}} black-and-white, electrostatic [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), the smallest CRT built into a commercially available product, and included a rechargeable 4-[[AA battery|AA]]-cell [[NiCad]] battery pack. It measured {{convert|4|*|6.25|*|1.625|in|mm}} and weighed {{convert|28|oz|g}}. It was able to receive either [[phase alternating line|PAL]] or [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] transmissions on [[very high frequency|VHF]] or [[ultra high frequency|UHF]]. A [[Wales|Welsh]] company, Wolsey Electronics, manufactured it for Sinclair. Custom [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s made by [[Texas Instruments]] and Sinclair contributed to its small size and low power consumption.

The original {{USD|395}} (about {{GBP|205}}&lt;ref name="GBP1976-1978" /&gt;) price tag proved to be too high to sell many of them, and Sinclair lost over {{GBP|1.8 million}} in 1978, eventually selling its remaining inventory to liquidators at greatly reduced prices.

The MTV-1B, released later in 1978 at the much lower price of {{GBP|99}}, was able to receive only British and South African UHF PAL signals.

{{Short description|Iranian-American Physicist}}
'''Manijeh Razeghi''' is an Iranian-american scientist.  A pioneer in the field of [[semiconductor]]s and [[Optoelectronics|optoelectronic devices]], her work at the core of 20th century optical fiber telecommunications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cqd.eecs.northwestern.edu/people/razeghi.php|title=Center for Quantum Devices - Director, Professor Manijeh Razeghi|last=McClintock|first=Ryan|website=cqd.eecs.northwestern.edu|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the development of new technologies.

[[File:Bus Stop, Sheffield Road - geograph.org.uk - 113067.jpg|thumb|A bus stop in Creswell, [[Derbyshire]], one of thousands of locations in the NaPTAN database.]]

The '''National Public Transport Access Node''' (NaPTAN) [[database]] is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] nationwide system for uniquely identifying all the points of access to [[public transport]] in the UK. The database is closely associated with the '''National Public Transport Gazetteer'''.

Every UK railway station, coach terminus, airport, ferry terminal, bus stop, [[taxicab stand|taxi rank]] or other place where public transport can be joined or left is allocated a unique NaPTAN identifier.  The relationship of the stop to a City, Town, Village or other locality can be indicated through an association with elements of the National Public Transport Gazetteer.

There is a [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standardisation initiative, [[Identification of Fixed Objects In Public Transport]] ('IFOPT'), to develop NaPTAN concepts into a European standard for stop identification as an extension to [[Transmodel]], the European standard for Public Transport information.

== Purpose of NaPTAN ==
The ability to identify and locate stops in relation to topography, both consistently and economically, is fundamental to modern computer based systems that provide passenger information and manage public transport networks.  Stop data is needed by [[journey planner]]s, scheduling systems, [[real-time systems]], for transport planning, performance monitoring, and for many other purposes. Digitalising a nation's public transport stops is an essential step in creating a national information infrastructure.

In the UK NaPTAN has enabled the creation of the [[Transport Direct Portal]], a UK nationwide system for multi-modal journey planning. NaPTAN also underpins [[TransXChange]], the UK standard for bus schedules, which is used for the [[Electronic Registration of Bus Services]].

== NaPTAN Components ==

NaPTAN comprises several distinct elements 
* A '''data model''', based on Transmodel.
* A '''data exchange format''', specified as an XML schema (see http://www.naptan.org.uk/schema/schemas.htm)
* A '''central database''' used to aggregate and distribute stop data from different UK regions.
* A '''process''' for different stakeholders to contribute, validate and share data.

NaPTAN identfiers are designed to be used within the UK's [[Digital National Framework]] a system of unique persistent reference for shareable information resources of all types managed by the [[Ordnance Survey]].

NaPTAN includes on a related standard - the UK National Public Transport Gazetteer.

=== The NaPTAN Database ===
The National Public Transport Access Node database holds a current copy of all UK stops.  Stops are submitted by [[Passenger transport executive|PTEs]] to a central authority which consolidates the stops and distributes them back to users. There are some 450,000 stop points in the current database.

The NaPTAN database is maintained centrally under contract to the Department of Transport.

=== The NaPTAN XML Schema ===
NaPTAN data is described by a NaPTAN XML Schema. This can be used to describe NaPTAN data when exchanging it between systems as XML documents.  It is versioned so that different generations of data can be managed.  See http://www.dft.gov.uk/naptan/schema/2.4/NaPTAN.xsd

===  NaPTAN Conceptual Model ===
The NPTG &amp; NaPTAN data conforms to a family of consistent, interlocking data models. The models are described in the NPTG &amp; NaPTAN Schema Guide in UML notation.

== NaPTAN Stops ==

=== NaPTAN Stop Numbering ===

NaPTAN identifiers are a systematic way of identifying of all UK points of access to public transport or "Stop points").

* Every UK rail station, bus and coach terminus, airport, ferry terminal, individual bus stop, tram stop, and  taxi rank is allocated a unique NaPTAN Identifier.
* For large interchanges &amp; termini, NaPTAN points identify the entrances from the public thoroughfare – one identifier is distinguished as the main entrance. Platforms may also be individually identified
* Every local authority has been allocated a unique prefix for their stop numbering, this ensures that stop numbers cannot be duplicated, in addition there are national number prefixes - 900 for coach stops, 910 for railway stations, 920 for airports, 930 for ferry terminals and 940 for metro and tram stops, the national stop numbers are created centrally and not by local authorities.
* In England stop details are provided by 87 local authorities and are prefixed with numbers ranging between 010 and 490.
* In Wales stop details are provided by 22 local authorities and are prefixed with numbers ranging between 511 and 582.
*In Scotland stop details are provided by 32 local authorities and are prefixed with numbers ranging between 601 and 690.

=== NaPTAN Stop Descriptors ===
NaPTAN stop points have a number of text descriptor elements associated with them: not just a name, but also additional labels and distinguishing identifiers that will help users to recognise them. These elements can be combined in different ways to provide   presentations of names useful for  many different contexts, for example on maps, stop finders, timetables etc., and on mobile devices

* Stop Points may have a '''Common Name''',  '''Short name''', '''Landmark''', '''Street''', '''Asset code''', etc.
* Stop Points may also have alternative names, for example for aliases for  different national languages.
* Stop Names may have a qualifier to distinguish them from  other stops within the same group of stops. For example, Bus Station (Stand 1) from Bus Station (Stand 2).

The Purpose of these descriptors is to create an iterative level of detail i.e. ''Country - County - Locality - Street - Name - Identifier''. All of this information should be included but it is up to the user of the data to decide how much data is relevant for the task in hand.

=== Stop Locations ===
Every NaPTAN point includes [[Coordinate reference system|geospatial coordinates]] specified in both [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] format and as [[WGS84]] latitide and longitude pairs. This allows NaPTAN points to be projected on maps and to be associated with other information layers such as the [[Integrated Transport Network]] of the Ordnance Survey.

==National Public Transport Gazetteer==
The National Public Transport Gazetteer is closely associated with the NaPTAN dataset and contains details of every City, Town, Village, suburb in Great Britain (i.e., UK but not including Northern Ireland). This dataset is based on usage of names, rather than legal definitions and so includes local informal names for places as well as their official names.

'''Nephoscope''' is an instrument  for  measuring  the  altitude, direction,  and  velocity of  [[cloud]]s. 
There are several types of nephoscopes:
*the comb nephoscope developed by [[Louis Besson (meteorologist)|Louis Besson]];
*the mirror nephoscope developed by [[Carl Gottfrid Fineman]];
*the grid nephoscope, a variation on the comb modified by the [[Norwegians]].

Also, a type of nephoscope was invented by [[Mikhail Pomortsev]] in 1894 in [[Russia]].

The nephoscope is used as a grid to measure the clouds.It is also used to find the movements of clouds.

A ray of light of known velocity is emitted from nephoscope, which will strike with the base of the clouds. The travel time of the receiving signal is used to get the height of the clouds. As
s = vt
t1+ t2/ 2

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6050">The research project '''OSAMI-D''' is the German subproject of the European [http://www.itea2.org/ ITEA ''2''] project [[OSAMI]] ('''O'''pen '''S'''ource '''AM'''bient '''I'''ntelligence).

The aim of the international project [http://www.osami-commons.org OSAMI] is the design of a basic, widely applicable [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]]-oriented component platform, its development, test and its provision as [[Open Source|open source]] software. The project consists of a number of national subprojects, each focussing on a certain field of application. The German subproject OSAMI-D, funded by the [http://www.bmbf.de/ BMBF], the German ministry of education and research, under reference number 01 IS 08003, contributes to the [[EHealth|e-Health]] domain. The main objectives are interoperability, maintainability, reliability, as well as automated configuration and management of medical devices and services to provide new forms of healthcare to diseased and convalescent people. The advantages of these technical contributions will be demonstrated by means of an e-Health application which supports ambulant cardiologic rehabilitation.&lt;br&gt;
The software component platform specified by the [[OSGi]] Alliance forms the technical basis of the OSAMI platform. It provides lifecycle management for software components as well as local service interactions as defined in service-oriented architectures and will be combined with the Web Services approach, in particular [[Devices Profile for Web Services|DPWS]] / [http://www.ws4d.org WS4D] in order to implement distributed, dynamically configurable, vendor-neutral and device-independent solutions.

===Work Packages and Tasks===
*WP 1: Coordination and Dissemination
*WP 2: Business, Trust and Processes (without participation of German subproject)
*WP 3: Organisation, Tools and Training (without participation of German subproject)
*WP 4: Vertical Domains - Analysis and Design&lt;BR&gt;The aim of WP 4 of the German subproject is the requirements analysis particularly for the use of the OSAMI-based services and systems in the application domain "IT in Healthcare" and design of the domain specific components for the OSAMI architecture. The intra-domain "horizontal" architecture design and the actual software implementation take place in WP 5.
*WP 5: OSAMI Interface &amp; Architecture&lt;BR&gt;WP 5 concentrates on defining the intra-domain OSAMI architecture considering SOA-principles for distributed, device-based systems and their realization under the Open Source licence model. The architecture is the basis of the implementation of components for the healthcare domain specified in WP 4. Complementary proprietary components and the [[policy-based management]] system are produced (ref. e.g. [[WS-Policy]]).
*WP 6: Security, Assets and User interface issues&lt;BR&gt;Data security, easy integration and management of the external components as well as multimodal and plainly defined user interfaces are important for the acceptance and wide applicability of OSAMI applications. These features set the stage for processing sensitive data and reduce the barriers for deployment.&lt;br&gt;The German subproject focuses on the data security for e-Health applications. These applications handle with sensitive, personal data and thus must be reliable. Therefore, there are distinct data security requirements, which are to be considered representatively for the requirements for the more sophisticated general applications.
*WP 7: Demonstrators&lt;BR&gt; In WP 7 the components of the e-Health demonstrator on the basis of the OSAMI architecture and the results of WPs 4 - 6 are to be integrated. The integrated hard- and software components are to be well tried and proven in a realistic scenario. The evaluation covers the acceptance of the new technologies by end users in addition to the technical requirements.&lt;br&gt;The development and the validation of the demonstrator occur in three successive phases. The first phase is intended for the implementation of a so-called "[[mock-up]]" with an initial design of the user interface and primary implementation of the corresponding hardware and software components. These form among others the basis for the following phases of the overall project's work plan.

'''Father Time''' (commonly known as '''Old Father Time''') is a [[weather vane]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]], [[London]], in the shape of [[Father Time]] removing the [[Bail (cricket)|bails]] from a [[Wicket#Set of stumps|wicket]].  The weathervane is a total of {{Convert|6|ft|6|in|abbr=on}} tall, with the figure of Father Time standing at {{Convert|5|ft|4|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="lordsweb" /&gt; It was given to Lord's in 1926 by the architect of the Grandstand, [[Herbert Baker|Sir Herbert Baker]].&lt;ref name="lordsweb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A brief history of Father Time at Lord's |first=Patrick |last=Kidd |newspaper=The Times |date=18 November 2009 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/cricket/article6920870.ece |accessdate=6 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although frequently referred to as 'Old' Father Time in television and radio broadcasts, 'Old' is not part of the official title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lords.org/news/our-blogs/the-cricket-history-blog/father-time-and-the-lords-slope|title=Father Time and the Lord's Slope|accessdate=30 March 2015|work=Lords Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of the figure derives from Law 16(3) of the [[Laws of Cricket]]:  "After the call of Time, the bails shall be removed from both wickets."

Old Father Time was originally located atop the old Grand Stand.  It was wrenched from its perch during [[the Blitz]], when it became entangled in the steel cable of a [[barrage balloon]],&lt;ref name="lordsweb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/current/story/246297.html |title=Lord's under attack |last=Williamson |first=Martin |date=6 May 2006 |work=Cricinfo |accessdate=6 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was repaired and returned to its previous position.  In 1992 the weather vane was struck by [[lightning]], and the subsequent repairs were featured on children's television programme ''[[Blue Peter]].''&lt;ref name="lordsweb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/features/2463/2.html |title=London's weather vanes |last=Brown |first=Matt |date=8 January 2007 |work=Time Out |accessdate=6 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Old Father Time was permanently relocated to the Mound Stand in 1996, when the Grand Stand was demolished and rebuilt.&lt;ref name="lordsweb" /&gt;

Father Time was again damaged in March 2015 by the high winds of [[Cyclone Niklas]] which required extensive repair by specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/32114081|title=Lord's Father Time weather vane damaged by high winds|accessdate=30 March 2015|work=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1969 Old Father Time became the subject of a poem, "Lord's Test", by the [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[England cricket team|England]] cricketer [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;John Snow, ''Cricket Rebel: An Autobiography'', Hamlyn Publishing Ltd, 1976, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paratransit''' is recognized in [[North America]] as special transportation services for people with disabilities, often provided as a supplement to fixed-route bus and rail systems by public transit agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amputee-coalition.org/fact_sheets/paratransit.html Fact Sheet: Paratransit Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208030328/http://www.amputee-coalition.org/fact_sheets/paratransit.html |date=2014-12-08 }} Retrieved 2014-04-26&lt;/ref&gt; Paratransit services may vary considerably on the degree of flexibility they provide their customers. At their simplest they may consist of a taxi or small bus that will run along a more or less defined route and then stop to pick up or discharge passengers on request. At the other end of the spectrum—fully [[demand responsive transport]]—the most flexible paratransit systems offer on-demand call-up door-to-door service from any origin to any destination in a service area. In addition to public transit agencies, Paratransit services are operated by community groups or not-for-profit organizations, and for-profit private companies or operators.

Typically, [[minibus]]es are used to provide paratransit service.  Most paratransit vehicles are equipped with [[wheelchair lift]]s or ramps to facilitate access.

In the [[United States]], private transportation companies often provide paratransit service in cities and metropolitan areas under contract to local public transportation agencies. [[Transdev]], [[First Transit]] and [[MV Transportation]] are among the largest private contractors of paratransit services in the United States and Canada.

==Terminology==
"Definition: any type of public transportation that is distinct from conventional transit, such as flexibly scheduled and routed services such as airport limousines, carpools, etc.
Etymology:  para- 'alongside of' + transit"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/paratransit paratransit Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232754/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/paratransit |date=2014-04-26 }}. Retrieved 2014-03-19&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of "paratransit" ("para transit", "para-transit") has evolved and taken on two somewhat separate broad sets of meaning and application.

The more general meaning involved projects starting in the early 1970s, documented by the [[Urban Institute]] in the 1974 book ''Para-transit: Neglected options for urban mobility'',&lt;ref&gt;Ronald F. Kirby, Urban Institute, et al (1974) ''Para-transit:neglected options for urban mobility'' {{ISBN|0-87766-121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed a year later by the first international overview, ''Paratransit: Survey of International Experience and Prospects''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Britton]] et al (1975) ''Paratransit: Survey of International Experience and Prospects'', EcoPlan International and [[U.S. Department of Transportation]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Cervero]]'s 1997 book, ''Paratransit in America: Redefining Mass Transportation'', embraced this wider definition of paratransit, arguing that America's mass transit sector should enlarge to include micro-vehicles, minibuses, and shared-taxi services found in many developing cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cervero|first1=Robert|authorlink=Robert Cervero|title=Paratransit in America: Redefining Mass Transportation|date=1997|publisher=Praeger Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=9780275957254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paratransit, as an alternative mode of flexible passenger transportation that does not follow fixed routes or schedules, are common and often offer the only mechanized mobility options for the poor in many parts of the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cervero|first1=Robert|authorlink=Robert Cervero|title=Informal Transit: Learning from the Developing World|journal=Access|date=2001|volume=18|pages=15–22|url=https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-2001/informal-transit-learning-developing-world/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328164554/https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-2001/informal-transit-learning-developing-world/|archivedate=2018-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1980s, particularly in North America, the term began to be used increasingly to describe the second meaning: special transport services for people with disabilities. In this respect, paratransit has become a subsector and business in its own right.

The term ''paratransit'' is rarely used outside of North America.

In 2013, the Canadian Urban Transit Association compared the eligibility requirements of paratransit services in Canada and the United States &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bv.transports.gouv.qc.ca/mono/1136638.pdf|title=Specialized Transit Eligibility Certification Programs: Overview of Canadian and U.S. Experience|publisher=The Canadian Urban Transit Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Annually, the Canadian Urban Transit Association publishes a fact book providing statistics for all of the Ontario specialized public transit services as of 2015 there were 79 in operation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/ser/192520/2015.pdf|title=Ontario Specialized Transit Services Fact Book - 2015 Operating Data|publisher=The Canadian Urban Transit Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In the United States==

===Rehabilitation Act of 1973===
Before passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), paratransit was provided by not-for-profit human service agencies and public transit agencies in response to the requirements in [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act]] of 1973. Section 504 prohibited the exclusion of the disabled from "any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance". In Title 49 Part 37 (49 CFR 37) of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], the [[Federal Transit Administration]] defined requirements for making buses accessible or providing complementary paratransit services within public transit service areas.

Most transit agencies did not see fixed route accessibility as desirable and opted for a flexible system of small paratransit vehicles operating parallel to a system of larger, fixed-route buses. The expectation was that the paratransit services would not be heavily used, making a flexible system of small vehicles a less expensive alternative for accessibility than options with larger, fixed-route vehicles. This however ended up not being the case. Often paratransit services were being filled up to their capacity. In some cases, leaving individuals who were in need of the door to door service provided by paratransit unable to utilize it due to the fact that disabled people who could use fixed-route vehicles also found themselves using these paratransit services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb2j49n5h3&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4|title=Shaping National Disability Policy: Transportation Access and Social Security Reforms|last=|first=|date=|website=oac.cdlib.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214235927/http://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb2j49n5h3&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4|archive-date=2017-12-14|dead-url=no|access-date=2017-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990===
With the passage of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act was extended to include ''all'' activities of state and local government. Its provisions were not limited to programs receiving federal funds and applied to all public transit services, regardless of how the services were funded or managed. Title II of the ADA also more clearly defined a disabled person's right to equal participation in transit programs, and the provider's responsibility to make that participation possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ada.gov/taman2html#II-1.4100 The Americans with Disabilities Act Title II Technical Assistance Manual Covering State and Local Government Programs and Services] Department of Justice ADA website. Retrieved 2010-2-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In revisions to Title 49 Part 37, the Federal Transit Administration defined the combined requirements of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act for transit providers. These requirements included "complementary" paratransit to destinations within 3/4 mile of all fixed routes (49 CFR 37.131) and submission of a plan for complying with complementary paratransit service regulations (49 CFR 37.135). Paratransit service is an [[unfunded mandate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jun/25/local/chi-paratransit-fundsjun25|title=Chicago Tribune - Historical Newspapers|author=|date=|website=chicagotribune.com|accessdate=30 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429153453/http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jun/25/local/chi-paratransit-fundsjun25|archivedate=29 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ADA, complementary paratransit service is required for passengers who are 1) Unable to navigate the public bus system, 2) unable to get to a point from which they could access the public bus system, or 3) have a temporary need for these services because of injury or some type of limited duration cause of disability (49 CFR 37.123). Title 49 Part 37 details the eligibility rules along with requirements governing how the service must be provided and managed. In the United States, paratransit service is now highly regulated and closely monitored for compliance with standards set by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA).

As the ADA became effective in 1992 (49 CFR 37.135), the FTA required transit systems in the United States to plan and begin implementing ADA compliant services, with full implementation by 1997 (49 CFR 37.139). During this period, paratransit demand and services rapidly expanded. This growth led to many new approaches to manage and provide these services. Computerized reservation, scheduling and dispatching for paratransit have also evolved substantially and are now arguably among the most sophisticated management systems available in the world of rubber tire transit (land-based non-rail public transit).

Since the passage of the ADA, paratransit service has grown rapidly as a mode of public transit in the United States. Continued growth can be expected due to the aging of [[baby boomer]]s and disabled Iraq War veterans.&lt;ref&gt;University of Detroit Mercy (2008-5-12).[http://rip.trb.org/browse/dproject.asp?n=17382 Improving Paratransit Services in the Toledo Metropolitan Area]. ''Research in Progress''. Transportation Research Board. Retrieved 2010-1-27&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the number of people requiring paratransit has resulted in an increase in cost for the paratransit industry to maintain these services.  The results of this rising cost are the paratransit industry trying to get individuals to move from a reliance on paratransit vehicles to fixed-route vehicles. Due to the push to have paratransit vehicles being the main method of transportation for disabled individuals prior to the passing of the ADA, the paratransit industry is finding it hard to get individuals to switch over to fixed route transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb2j49n5h3&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4|title=Shaping National Disability Policy: Transportation Access and Social Security Reforms|website=oac.cdlib.org|access-date=2017-12-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214235927/http://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb2j49n5h3&amp;query=&amp;brand=oac4|archivedate=2017-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US Government Accountability Office [[GAO]] released a report in November 2012 for the [[Federal Transit Administration]] which "examined: (1) the extent of compliance with ADA paratransit requirements, (2) changes in ADA paratransit demand and costs since 2007, and (3) actions transit agencies are taking to help address changes in the demand for and costs of ADA paratransit service."  The report found that "average number of annual ADA paratransit trips provided by a transit agency increased 7 percent from 2007 to 2010" and that the average cost of providing a paratransit trip is "an estimated three and a half times more expensive than the average cost of $8.15 to provide a fixed-route trip."

[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]]'s [[MetroAccess]] service in [[Washington, D.C.]] conducted a peer review of large urban paratransit systems in the US in 2009:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/061109_IIIDMetroAccessReview.pdf|title=Review of MetroAccess Ridership, Costs and Policy|publisher=WMATA Finance Committee Report|date=June 11, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201023302/http://wmata.com/about_metro/board_of_directors/board_docs/061109_IIIDMetroAccessReview.pdf|archivedate=February 1, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to increasing ridership and costs of providing paratransit service, [[WMATA]] made two significant changes beginning in 2010: the paratransit service area was reduced from jurisdictional boundaries to the ADA requirement of within a 3/4 mile corridor of fixed-route services;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/24/AR2010052403749.html MetroAccess paratransit service to be scaled back because of rising cost, demand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014194907/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/24/AR2010052403749.html |date=2017-10-14 }}.

=== Technology ===

The complicated nature of providing paratransit service in accordance with ADA guidelines led to the development of sophisticated software for the industry.

[[Intelligent transportation system]]s technologies, primarily [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[mobile data terminal]]s, [[Digital Mobile Radio|digital mobile radios]], and cell phones, and scheduling, dispatching and call reservation software are now in use increasingly in North America and Europe. [[Interactive voice response]] systems and web-based initiatives are the next technology innovation anticipated for paratransit services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trapezegroup.com/case-studies/metroaccess-service-washington-metropolitan-area-transit-authority-wmata WMATA’s MetroAccess Service, Washington, D.C.: Demand Response Traveler Information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426232321/http://www.trapezegroup.com/case-studies/metroaccess-service-washington-metropolitan-area-transit-authority-wmata |date=2014-04-26 }}. Retrieved 2014-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced analytics is another field being applied to paratransit operations. Some companies are beginning to integrate [[cloud computing]] models to find operational efficiencies and cost savings for smaller paratransit service providers.

==Canada==

There is no legislation providing details on paratransit standards, but the [[Canadian Urban Transit Association]] has provide voluntary guidelines for member transit agency to use to determine para transit needs and standards.

In Australia, Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport under subsection 31 (1) of the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 mandated that as of 2002 "all new public transport conveyances, premises and infrastructure must comply with the transport standards. Facilities already in operation at that time have between five and thirty years to comply with the standards."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/DisabilityStandards/Pages/Disabilitystandardsforaccesiblepublictransport.aspx Disability standards for accessible public transport] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234025/http://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/HumanRights/DisabilityStandards/Pages/Disabilitystandardsforaccesiblepublictransport.aspx |date=2014-04-26 }}, retrieved 2014-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of the world, transportation services for the elderly and disabled are obtainable through [[Share Taxi]] options, often without formal government involvement.

Paratransit systems in many [[developing world]] cities are operated by individuals and small business. The fragmented, intensely competitive nature of the industry makes government regulation and control much harder than traditional public transport. Government authorities have cited problems with unsafe vehicles and drivers as justifying efforts to regulate and "formalize" paratransit operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cervero|first1=Robert|title=Informal Transport in the Developing World|date=2000|publisher=United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (HABITAT)|location=Nairobi|isbn=9211314534}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these efforts have been limited by ignorance on the part of regulatory authorities and mistrust between
authorities and operators.&lt;ref&gt;H. Schalekamp, D. Mfinanga, P. Wilkinson, R. Behrens (2009).

A '''passenger service system''' ('''PSS''') is a series of critical systems used by airlines. The PSS usually comprises an [[airline reservations system]], an airline inventory system and a [[departure control system]] (DCS).

== Overview ==

Generally the PSS is made up of modules that are used to manage different parts of the airline’s business.

The airline reservations system is the system that allows an airline to sell their inventory (seats). It contains information on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations (or [[passenger name record]]s) and of tickets issued (if applicable).

The airline inventory system may or may not be integrated with the reservation system. The system contains all the airline’s flights and the available seats. The main function of the inventory system is to define how many seats are available on a particular flight by opening or closing an individual booking class in accordance with rules defined by the airline.

The departure control system is the system used by airlines and airports to check-in a passenger. The DCS is connected to the reservation system enabling it to check who has a valid reservation on a flight. The DCS is used to enter information required by customs or border security agencies and to issue the boarding document. In addition the DCS may also be used to dispatch cargo and to optimize aircraft [[Center of gravity of an aircraft|weight and balance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14808">The '''DP70''' is a model of [[Movie projector|motion picture projector]], of which approximately 1,500 were manufactured by the Electro-Acoustics Division of [[Philips]] between 1954 and about 1968.&lt;ref&gt;http://in70mm.com/dp70/story/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  It is notable for having been the first mass-produced theater projector in which [[35mm film#Academy format|4/35]] and [[70mm film|5/70]] [[Release print|prints]] could be projected by a single machine, thereby enabling wide film to become a mainstream exhibition technology, for its recognition in the [[35th Academy Awards|1963 Academy Awards]], which led to it being described as "the only projector to win an Oscar" (though this is technically incorrect, because the award was actually a Class 2 Oscar Plaque), and for its longevity: a significant number remain in revenue-earning service at the time of writing (February 2014).

==Research and development==
Small-scale attempts had been made to use wide film for commercial theater exhibition around the time of the conversion to sound, of which [[70 mm Grandeur film|Fox Grandeur]] was technologically the closest to the format the DP70 was designed to facilitate the launch of, two decades later.  One of the reasons these early systems failed to establish wide film as an industry standard was that the projectors developed for them were incompatible with the existing 4/35 standard.  In order to be able to project both, therefore, theaters had to be equipped with two sets of projectors, which involved significant extra cost and in some cases architectural modifications to projection booths.

The DP70 (DP stands for "Double Projector") was invented and developed by a team headed by Jan-Jacob Kotte of Philips between 1952–54, as part of the [[Todd-AO]] system.  A core objective of the project was to create a single machine that could project both the [[70mm film#Todd-AO|Todd-AO 5/70 format]] and the 4/35 format which was, and was likely to remain, the dominant standard for theater exhibition.

==Service history==
The first DP70s were exported from The Netherlands to the United States in the fall of 1954, and were used for the [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] release of the feature that was made to launch Todd-AO, [[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|''Oklahoma!'']] DP70s were used exclusively as part of the Todd-AO system for the first few years, but were eventually sold independently by Philips and its resellers to theaters worldwide.  The DP70 was widely praised for its versatility, reliability and ease of use, which was recognized by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] in 1963.  During the 1960s DP70 installations appeared throughout the world, mainly in prestige, downtown first run venues.  As a result of the machine's success, dual gauge projectors were quickly developed and launched by Philips's main competitors, notably [[Cinemeccanica]] of Italy and Century of the United States.

Almost 60 years after the first DP70s shipped from the factory, a significant number remain in regular, commercial use worldwide.  In 1972 the cinema division of Philips was bought out by [[Kinoton]], a German company that had handled European sales and support for Philips cinema products since 1949.&lt;ref name="kinoton_history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kinoton.de/en/kinoton/history.html | title=Kinoton History | work=Kinoton.de | publisher=Unknown | location=Germering, Germany | date=Unknown | accessdate=6 May 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PNtJGBsG | archivedate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After-sales support for the DP70 passed to Kinoton at that point, which continued to manufacture and distribute replacement parts until the company was wound up in April 2014.&lt;ref name="kinoton_closed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://celluloidjunkie.com/2014/04/01/kinoton-latest-victim-switch-digital-cinema/ | title=Kinoton is Latest Victim of Switch to Digital Cinema | work=Celluloid Junkie | publisher=Unknown | location=Unknown | date=1 April 2014 | accessdate=6 May 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PNszNWzo | archivedate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accessories and modifications are available (some of them were made by Kinoton, others by [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] manufacturers) that will enable the DP70 to project every 5/70 and 4/35 format that was ever used on a significant scale, most notably for the 35mm digital optical sound systems launched in the 1990s, e.g. [[Dolby Digital#Dolby Digital in the cinema|Dolby Digital]], and for [[DTS (sound system)#DTS 70 mm|70mm DTS]].

Though the projection of film itself in mainstream, first run theaters has been superseded almost completely by [[Digital cinema|digital projection]] at the time of writing, DP70s remain in service in [[cinematheque]]-type venues that specialize in showing [[Art film|repertory]] and [[Film preservation|archive]] titles.  Theaters in which DP70s are still running today include the [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre|Egyptian Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]], the [[Gartenbaukino]] in Vienna, the Pictureville cinema at the UK's [[National Media Museum]] and [[:sv:Rigoletto (biograf)|Rigoletto]] in Stockholm.

==Nomenclature==
The fact that the DP70 was a Dutch machine developed specifically for a customer in the United States resulted in it being known by several different names.  The DP70 was Philips's original model name for the projector, and this is what projectionists in Europe tend to call it.  In the United States, the [[American Optical Company]] (the AO in Todd-AO) used the Philips factory model number, EL4000/01 (the 60&amp;nbsp;Hz variant - the 50&amp;nbsp;Hz one, for sale in European markets, was model no. EL4000/00), as their catalog number for the machine.  It was eventually marketed independently of Todd-AO by [[Norelco]] (a contraction of "North American Philips Electrical Company", i.e. the brand name used by Philips in the US).&lt;ref name="DP70_brochure"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://in70mm.com/dp70/library/brochures/pdf/Universal_70_35_Projector.pdf | title=Norelco Universal 70-35 Projector | work=in70mm.com | publisher=Norelco | location=Buffalo, New York | date=1955 | accessdate=6 May 2014 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PNtlxlJR | archivedate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DP70 was originally sold in the United States simply as the "Norelco Universal 70/35mm Motion Picture Projector".  After its acknowledgment in the 1963 Oscars, Norelco rebranded it as the AA (Academy Award).  An improved version of the projector was also launched in 1963, which was branded as the AAII in the US.

All the projector mechanisms were built at the Philips factory in [[Eindhoven]], though much of the peripheral hardware for the machines that were exported to the United States, e.g. bases and reel magazines, was manufactured locally, initially by the American Optical Company and later by [[Ballantyne Strong, Inc.|Ballantyne]].

==Features==

===Overview===
The DP70 consists of a [[monocoque]], cast iron chassis containing the mechanism, which is completely oil-immersed on the non-operating side.  Jan-Jacob Kotte believed that the use of heavier materials to absorb vibration reduced instability in the projected image, and this is certainly reflected in the design of the DP70: a complete outfit, including the bases and reel magazines, weighs 1,004&amp;nbsp;lbs - literally half a ton!  The DP70 was also significantly more expensive than any single gauge theater projector on the market: a US customer was quoted $6,225 for one in 1966 ($44,942 in 2014, adjusted for [[Consumer price index|CPI]] inflation), which was around the cost of a typical three-bedroom suburban home at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.in70mm.com/dp70/story/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The price asked for a double set without lenses asked in West-Germany in 1956 was 42,510.00 Marks, which at the rate of exchange at that time (4:1), related to 10,627.50 $ for the pair, or 5,313.75 $ per projector.&lt;ref&gt;invoice from 1956-12&lt;/ref&gt; That price was higher, than 35mm only projectors, but still reasonably low if compared to competitors like Bauer U2.&lt;ref&gt;Invoice from 1959-09&lt;/ref&gt; The low price and reasonable quality was an important part of the success. Because the DP70 was built to commission for a customer in the United States, it is a very unusual example of a European-designed piece of industrial machinery with [[fastener]]s that have [[SAE International|SAE]] rather than [[Metric system|metric]] dimensions.

===Removable components===

Detachable reel magazines can be fitted (e.g. to enable the projection of [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]] in accordance with safety regulations), or removed (e.g. to enable projection using an external film transport device such as a platter or tower, or to fit an external audio reader) as needed.  Special fire trap rollers for nitrate were also available, to comply with fire regulations in some jurisdictions.  Separate [[Movie projector#Magnetic sound|magnetic]] and [[Movie projector#Analog Optical Sound|analog optical]] audio heads are built into the mechanism itself, enabling all 5/70 magnetic and 4/35 optical formats to be projected without the need to adjust or replace any audio components.  The change of gauge is done by swapping some gate components, pad roller assemblies, reel spindles and the lens, and in some cases making minor adjustments to the lamphouse.  This procedure can be completed by a competent [[projectionist]] in 5–10 minutes, which is a major reason for the DP70's popularity with venues that show 4/35 and 5/70 prints interchangeably.

===Cooling===

Because the DP70 was intended for use with 70mm film and in large theaters with a long throw to a big screen, several features were included to disperse the intense heat generated by the more powerful lamps with which it was often used.  The gate assembly includes [[copper]] components which are silver-plated, and a liquid-cooled plate that is fitted with a water pipe surrounding the aperture opening.  The use of liquid recirculating equipment and [[distilled water]] was encouraged.  A single-blade shutter designed to rotate at very high speed (up to 3,600 [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]]) doubles as a cooling fan. Unlike other projectors of its hi-power kind, the DP 70 did not offer forced-air cooling of the film itself, which is known to be a key feature to prevent overheating of the film and the major nitrate-fire prevention measure. A water cooled pre-shield just assists in keeping the gate and metal parts cold, not the film.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer Kino Technisches Taschenbuch&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motor===

The DP70 as shipped from the factory was equipped for dual speed operation, at 24[[Frame rate|fps]] (the frame rate at which almost all 4/35 prints with a combined soundtrack are projected at) and 30fps, the frame rate used in the original Todd-AO system.  The original version of the DP70 used separate drive motors for 24fps and 30fps operation, whereas the AAII had a single motor and a dual locking pulley mechanism on the main drive shaft to change the speed of the mechanism.  There were also several other more minor changes in the AAII.

Because many of the DP70s remaining in use today are in repertory venues that screen a wide range of formats, including prints of [[Silent film#Projection speeds|silent movies]] that require a lower frame rate than 24, a lot of them have now received aftermarket modifications that will typically enable any speed between 16 and 30.  Since US market DP70 seem to be factory equipped with synchronous motors that lock their speed (1,800 RPM in the USA) to the [[Alternating current|AC]] line frequency (60 [[Hertz|Hz]] in the USA), the most common way of doing this has been to add a variable frequency solid state AC [[Power inverter|inverter]] (Baldor Inverter) to drive the 24fps motor. Most European units were sold employing asynchronous motors, which added slip to the synchronous speed (1500 RPM at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz) to achieve the required 24 frames (1440 RPM) and 30 frames (1800 rpm), without gearing requirements in the original construction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12130">A '''polymer-bonded explosive''', also called '''PBX''' or '''plastic-bonded explosive''', is an [[explosive]] material in which explosive powder is bound together in a matrix using small quantities (typically 5–10% by weight) of a synthetic [[polymer]]. PBXs are normally used for explosive materials that are not easily melted into a casting, or are otherwise difficult to form.  PBX was first developed in 1952 in [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], as [[RDX]] embedded in [[polystyrene]] with [[dioctyl phthalate]] [[plasticizer]]. [[HMX]] compositions with [[teflon]]-based binders were developed in 1960s and 1970s for [[shell (projectile)|gun shells]] and for [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) seismic experiments,&lt;ref name="chemexpl" /&gt; although the latter experiments are usually cited as using [[hexanitrostilbene]] (HNS).&lt;ref name=nasa-alsep&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/documents/NASA%20RP-1036.pdf  |title=ALSEP (Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package) Termination Report |authors=James R.Bates; W.W.Lauderdale;  Harold Kernaghan |date=April 1979 |format=pdf-8.81 mb |publisher=NASA-Scientific and Technical Information Office |accessdate=2014-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential advantages ==
Polymer-bonded explosives have several potential advantages:
* If the polymer matrix is an [[elastomer]] (rubbery material), it tends to absorb shocks, making the PBX very insensitive to accidental detonation, and thus ideal for [[insensitive munitions]].
* Hard polymers can produce PBX that is very rigid and maintains a precise engineering shape even under severe stress.
* PBX powders can be pressed into a particular shape at room temperature, when casting normally requires hazardous melting of the explosive. High pressure pressing can achieve density for the material very close to the theoretical crystal density of the base explosive material.
* Many PBXes are safe to machine—to turn solid blocks into complex three-dimensional shapes. For example, a [[billet (manufacturing)|billet]] of PBX can, if necessary, be precisely shaped on a [[lathe]] or [[CNC machine]]. This technique is used to machine [[explosive lens]]es necessary for modern nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=nuke-arch-explo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#4.1.6.2.2.5 |author=Carey Sublette |work=4.

== Binders ==

=== Fluoropolymers ===
[[Fluoropolymer]]s are advantageous as binders due to their high [[density]] (yielding high [[detonation velocity]]) and inert chemical behavior (yielding long shelf stability and low [[Aging (material science)|aging]]). They are however somewhat brittle, as their [[glass transition]] temperature is at room temperature or above; this limits their use to insensitive explosives (e.g. [[TATB]]) where the brittleness does not have detrimental effect to safety. They are also difficult to process.&lt;ref name="nonshockinit" /&gt;

=== Elastomers ===
[[Elastomer]]s have to be used with more mechanically sensitive explosives, e.g. [[HMX]]. The elasticity of the matrix lowers sensitivity of the bulk material to shock and friction; their glass transition temperature is chosen to be below the lower boundary of the temperature working range (typically below -55&amp;nbsp;°C). [[Crosslinked]] [[synthetic rubber|rubber]] polymers are however sensitive to aging, mostly by action of [[free radical]]s and by [[hydrolysis]] of the bonds by traces of water vapor. Rubbers like [[thermoplastic polyurethanes|Estane]] or [[hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene]] (HTPB) are used for these applications extensively. [[Silicone rubber]]s and [[thermoplastic polyurethanes]] are also in use.&lt;ref name="nonshockinit" /&gt;

[[Fluoroelastomer]]s, e.g. [[Viton]], combine the advantages of both.

=== Energetic polymers ===
Energetic polymers (e.g. nitro or azido derivates of polymers) can be used as a binder to increase the explosive power in comparison with inert binders. [[Plasticizer#Plasticizers for energetic materials|Energetic plasticizers]] can be also used. The addition of a plasticizer lowers the sensitivity of the explosive and improves its processibility.&lt;ref name="chemexpl"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9tIQDn2uZz4C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=polymer+bonded+explosives&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=polymer%20bonded%20explosives&amp;f=false |title=The Chemistry of Explosives |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-85404-640-9 |author1=Akhavan |first1=Jacqueline |date=2004-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insults (potential explosive inhibitors) ==
Explosive yields can be affected by the introduction of mechanical loads or the application of temperature; such damages are called '''insults'''. The mechanism of a thermal insult at low temperatures on an explosive is primarily thermomechanical, at higher temperatures it is primarily thermochemical.

=== Thermomechanical ===
Thermomechanical mechanisms involve stresses by thermal expansion (namely differential thermal expansions, as thermal gradients tend to be involved), melting/freezing or sublimation/condensation of components, and phase transitions of crystals (e.g. transition of HMX from beta phase to delta phase at 175&amp;nbsp;°C involves a large change in volume and causes extensive cracking of its crystals).

=== Thermochemical ===
Thermochemical changes involve decomposition of the explosives and binders, loss of strength of binder as it softens or melts, or stiffening of the binder if the increased temperature causes crosslinking of the polymer chains. The changes can also significantly alter the porosity of the material, whether by increasing it (fracturing of crystals, vaporization of components) or decreasing it (melting of components). The size distribution of the crystals can be also altered, e.g. by [[Ostwald ripening]]. Thermochemical decomposition starts to occur at the crystal nonhomogeneities, e.g. intragranular interfaces between crystal growth zones, on damaged parts of the crystals, or on interfaces of different materials (e.g. crystal/binder). Presence of defects in crystals (cracks, voids, solvent inclusions...) may increase the explosive's sensitivity to mechanical shocks.&lt;ref name="nonshockinit" /&gt;

===Early history===
[[Image:FirstPublix.jpg|thumb|The first Publix Super Market in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], circa 1940. It is now a [[thrift store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowe|first=Trent|title=The Insider: St. Matt's Is Moving|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20091218/news/912185032#gsc.tab=0|accessdate= February 5, 2014|newspaper=[[The Ledger]]|location=[[Lakeland, Florida]]|date=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[George W. Jenkins|George Jenkins]] opened the first Publix market in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], on September 6, 1930 - a 27&amp;nbsp;ft by 65&amp;nbsp;ft building at 199 West Central Avenue.&lt;!-- THIS IS THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE!

In 1935, he opened a second market, the Economy Food Store, also in Winter Haven. Despite the [[Great Depression]], his stores were financially successful.

In 1940, Jenkins, affectionately called "Mr. George" by his employees, [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] grove to build Florida's first [[supermarket]]. His "food palace" had [[Elevator music|piped-in music]], [[air conditioning]], cold cases for [[Frozen food|frozen]] and [[refrigerated]] items, in-store [[doughnut]] and [[Floristry|flower shops]], and [[Electric eye|electric-eye automatic doors]]. During [[World War II]], material shortages prevented him from building additional stores. In 1945, Jenkins purchased the 19-store All American chain of food stores and converted them into Publix Super Markets.&lt;ref name=LetsGoDigital/&gt;

In 1951, Publix moved its headquarters from [[Winter Haven, Florida|Winter Haven]] to [[Lakeland, Florida]], and built its first distribution [[warehouse]] there. At the same time, they began to close the All American stores, replacing them with Publix markets. In 1956, Publix achieved $50 million in sales, and $1 million in profit. In 1957, the donut shop in each store was expanded into a full-service bakery.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

===Florida expansion===
[[File:PublixMiamiBeach.JPG|thumb|A 1960s-style Publix Super Market store [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] on Dade Avenue in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]]]
By 1959, Publix was the dominant supermarket chain in [[Central Florida]], and began expansion to [[South Florida]]. In 1963, the company built a distribution center in [[Miami]], and began providing [[Delicatessen|deli]] services. In 1970, sales surpassed $500 million; they reached $1 billion in 1974, when the chain expanded to include [[Jacksonville, Florida]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1982, the company launched the ''[[#Presto!|Presto!]]'' [[automated teller machine|ATM]] network; it soon installed ATMs in every Publix. Sales exceeded $5 billion in 1989.&lt;!-- THIS IS THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE! SECONDARY SOURCES, NOT A PRIMARY ONE, IS NEEDED FOR THIS INFORMATION!

In 1983, [[Carol Jenkins Barnett]] joined the Publix Board of Directors and served in that role until 2016. During her time at Publix, the company grew into the largest supermarket chain in Florida, expanded into five other states, and recorded $32.5 billion in sales in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-publix-carol-jenkins-barnett-alzheimers-20160617-story.html|title=Publix director Carol Jenkins Barnett, daughter of founder, steps down at 59 with Alzheimer's diagnosis|last=Arnold|first=Kyle|work=OrlandoSentinel.com|accessdate=November 28, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Publix Britton Plaza 2008 1.jpg|thumb|A converted Albertsons location in [[South Tampa|South Tampa, Florida]]]]
Publix Super Markets bought 49 Florida stores from [[Albertsons LLC|Albertsons]]. The deal was announced on June 9, 2008, and was completed on September 9, 2008. It included 15 locations in [[North Florida]], 30 in [[Central Florida]], and four in [[South Florida]]. The sale allowed Publix to operate four stores in a new market area for the company, [[Escambia County, Florida]] (the [[Pensacola]] area).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2008-06-10/business/publix10_1_albertsons-stores-publix-grocery|title=Publix to buy 49 Albertsons stores in Florida|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|accessdate=November 28, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2009, Publix opened its 1,000th store in [[St. Augustine, Florida]], allowing the company to become one of only five U.S. grocery retailers to operate that many stores. The St. Augustine store is among Publix's first stores designed to be [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]]. The store includes [[motion sensor]] lights throughout the store, including on the freezer doors, and an overhead light system that can be controlled by each department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Publix Ready to Open Its 1,000th Store Next Month In St. Augustine| url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20090121/NEWS/901210361?Title=Publix-Ready-to-Open-Its-1-000th-Store-Next-Month-In-St-Augustine&amp;tc=ar| date=January 21, 2009| author=Kyle Kennedy| work=The Ledger|location=Lakeland, Florida| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern and Mid-Atlantic expansion===
The first Publix outside [[Florida]] opened in [[Savannah, Georgia]], in 1991; distribution and manufacturing facilities in [[Dacula, Georgia]] (a northeastern suburb of [[Atlanta]]) soon followed, as it began to expand into [[Atlanta metropolitan area|metro Atlanta]] in 1993. Publix further expanded into [[South Carolina]] (1993), [[Alabama]] (1996), [[Tennessee]] (2002), [[North Carolina]] (2014) and [[Virginia]] (2017).

In 2011, Publix announced it was expanding into [[North Carolina]], initially by opening stores in the [[Charlotte metropolitan area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/print-edition/2011/04/08/Publix-lines-up-second-site-in-region.html?s=print |title=Publix lines up second site in Charlotte region; two more in works - Charlotte Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later announced construction of a new store in [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wlos.com/template/cgi-bin/archived.pl?type=basic&amp;file=/shared/news/features/top-stories/stories/archive/2013/08/JmecSVL8.xml#.UkbW3j_Nl0k |title=Search Results - WLOS ABC13 |publisher=WLOS |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Charlotte-area Publix stores (on the [[South Carolina]] [[Fort Mill, South Carolina|side of the metropolitan area]], opened in 2012); the first [[North Carolina]] Publix store opened in [[Ballantyne, North Carolina|Ballantyne]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2014/02/25/4723568/publix-set-to-open-wednesday-in.html# |title=Publix opens in Ballantyne; first store in North Carolina |publisher=Charlotte Observer |date= |accessdate=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concurrently, Publix purchased seven Charlotte-area locations from competitor [[BI-LO (United States)|BI-LO]] stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publix to buy seven Bi-Lo stores in Charlotte area - Charlotte Business Journal|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/going_green/2013/09/publix-to-buy-seven-bi-lo-stores-in.html|website = Charlotte Business Journal|accessdate = November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publix completed the purchase of property in [[Boone, North Carolina]] on November 20, 2015 with plans to open in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wataugademocrat.com/news/kmart-site-sold-to-publix-for-m/article_40c0342d-30ec-5777-849b-6f42d2cc1eed.html | title=Kmart Site Sold to Publix | date=November 23, 2015 | accessdate=November 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Publix announced their entry into the [[Virginia]] market, with the signing of two store leases, the first in [[Bristol, Virginia|Bristol]] scheduled to open in 2017 and the second in [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] scheduled for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publix supermarkets are coming to Virginia - The Roanoke Times|url = http://www.roanoke.com/business/columns_and_blogs/blogs/storefront/publix-supermarkets-are-coming-to-virginia/article_c8025245-42ee-5a61-81aa-dd292f33c419.html|website = The Roanoke Times|accessdate = February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, it was announced that Publix had entered into a purchase agreement with [[Ahold]] and [[Delhaize Group]] for 10 [[Giant-Carlisle#Martin's|Martin's Food Markets]] locations in the Richmond market as part of the divestiture of stores to gain clearance from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] for the impending Ahold/Delhaize merger.

Each store provides products and services in its [[grocery]], [[Delicatessen|deli]], [[bakery]], [[produce]], [[floral]], [[meat]], and [[seafood]] departments. Some stores have [[valet parking]], [[Cafeterias|cafés]], [[sushi]] bars, [[pharmacy]] departments, and/or a [[liquor store]].

The customer service counter also provides [[cheque|check]] cashing, [[money order]]s, [[Western Union]] services, [[Carpet cleaning|Rug Doctor]] rentals, and [[lottery]] tickets. Some stores also provide DVD rental services. In December 2005, Publix discontinued its photo processing service, replacing it with an online or mail-order service via the [[Snapfish]] program.&lt;ref name=LetsGoDigital&gt;{{cite news| title=HP Snapfish powers Publix Online Photo Service| author=Mark Peters| date=December 12, 2005| url=http://www.letsgodigital.org/en/news/articles/story_5389.html| publisher=Letsgodigital.org| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Snapfish agreement has since been terminated, and Publix no longer offers photo services.

=== Aprons ===
Publix operates 11 cooking schools under the Aprons name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Publix Aprons Cooking School| url=http://www.publix.com/recipes-planning/aprons-cooking-schools| publisher=Publix| accessdate=September 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The schools offer cooking demonstrations in which customers are encouraged to sample easy-to-make, nutritious dishes prepared at in-store kiosks and take a recipe card with them. All recipes are developed in-house, using easy-to-prepare or prepackaged ingredients, often available at the Aprons kiosk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Publix offers meal preparation program| work=Jacksonville Business Journal| publisher=Bizjournals.com| date=October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Publix introduced its Aprons make-ahead meals concept. Customers could purchase meals that they could assemble in-store or, for an extra charge, an Aprons associate would prepare and assemble the meals. These were standalone stores located in Jacksonville and [[Lithia, Florida]]. In summer 2009, Publix closed both locations citing lack of customer interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/retail/publix-ends-its-aprons-make-ahead-meals-store-experiment/1028785|title=Publix ends its Apron's Make-Ahead Meals store experiment|last=Albright|first=Mark|date=August 18, 2009|work=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=October 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000840/http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/retail/publix-ends-its-aprons-make-ahead-meals-store-experiment/1028785|archive-date=March 4, 2016|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GreenWise Market ===
[[Image:Publix GreenWise Market (Tampa, FL).JPG|thumb|The exterior of a first-generation Publix GreenWise Market in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]]]
GreenWise Market is a concept the company introduced in response to the increase in the number and [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of [[health food store]]s. GreenWise Markets were created to increase awareness of [[nutrition]]; it focuses on organic and natural items. These stores are similar to the [[Whole Foods Market]] chain. In addition to organic and traditional products, GreenWise Markets include [[salad bar|salad]] and hot bars. The first six stores were set to be in [[Palm Beach Gardens, Florida|Palm Beach Gardens]], [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]], [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], and [[Coral Springs, Florida|Coral Springs]], Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Publix expands GreenWise Markets| |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2007/02/05/daily31.html| work=South Florida Business Journal| publisher=Bizjournals.com| date=February 7, 2007| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Publix GreenWise Market (Tampa, FL) Interior.JPG|thumb|The interior of a first-generation Publix GreenWise Market]]
From 2008 to 2016, the company focused on a "hybrid" concept instead,&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel3.31.17&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-bz-publix-greenwise-20170331-story.html|title=Publix putting GreenWise stores back in plans|last=Arnold|first=Kyle|date=March 31, 2017|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=April 19, 2017|publisher=tronc, inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrating the GreenWise concept into traditional Publix stores. Approximately half of locations built since 2008 are considered hybrid stores.

In 2017, the company announced they would resume building standalone GreenWise locations, the first of which will be near the campus of [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], opening in 2018.&lt;ref name=OrlandoSentinel3.31.17/&gt;

===Publix Sabor===
Publix operates seven stores, branded "Publix Sabor" (''sabor'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "flavor"), which cater to [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]] living in Florida and offer products for Hispanics. Located in [[Miami-Dade County]] in [[Greater Miami]], the seven themed stores are spread between [[Miami]] and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]].&lt;!-- THIS IS THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE!

In August 2011, Publix began offering [[Lisinopril]], an [[ACE inhibitor]] that is used to prevent, treat, or improve symptoms of [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], certain heart conditions, [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], and certain chronic kidney conditions, as another free prescription. Customers can get a 90-day supply of this prescription for free at any Publix Pharmacy, up to a maximum of 180 tablets. Lisinopril-HCTZ combination products are excluded.&lt;ref name=PublixMedication/&gt;&lt;ref name=PublixNewsroom/&gt;

In May 2014, Publix began offering [[Amlodipine]], a [[calcium channel blocker]] used to treat [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and chest pain ([[Angina pectoris|angina]]) as a free medication.

====The Little Clinic====
In early 2006, Publix and The Little Clinic signed an exclusive agreement to open medical clinics within Publix stores. The first clinics were opened in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta]], [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami]], [[Greater Orlando|Orlando]], and [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa]] markets in the first half of 2006. The Little Clinic health-care centers were staffed by nurse practitioners who can write prescriptions, provide diagnosis and treatment of common ailments and minor injuries, and offer wellness care like physicals, screenings, and vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Publix and The Little Clinic to Open Walk-in Medical Clinics| date=February 6, 2006| work=Business Library| publisher=Findarticles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective May 9, 2011, Publix closed the Little Clinics in its stores in order to focus on its core pharmacy and grocery business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Publix Closes Little Clinics| author=Sandra Pedicini| date=May 17, 2011| work=Orlando Sentinel| publisher=OrlandoSentinel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== BayCare telehealth sites ====
Publix and BayCare Health System announced a collaboration to provide [[telehealth]] and [[telemedicine]] services at specialized [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]] in four [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa Bay]]-area counties in March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2017/03/17/publix-partners-with-baycare-on-in-store.html|title=Publix partners with BayCare on in-store telehealth sites in the Bay area|last=Manning|first=Margie|date=March 17, 2017|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=March 30, 2017|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmacies participating in the program have private rooms for [[patient]]s to speak with a [[Board certification|board-certified]] [[physician]] in BayCare's network via [[Teleconference|teleconferencing]], plus diagnostic tools that can be used by the patient, with or without assistance from pharmacy staff.&lt;!-- THIS IS THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE!

=== Online shopping and delivery services ===
[[File:PublixDirectLogo.png|thumb|Logo of the defunct PublixDirect online shopping and delivery service]]

==== Publix Curbside ====
After PublixDirect, Publix made a second attempt in 2010 at [[e-commerce]] with the introduction of Publix Curbside. Customers had the ability to browse and purchase groceries online, then drive to a participating location where an associate will have selected their items and would bring them out to the buyer's vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internetretailer.com/2010/08/16/publix-launches-its-second-e-commerce-attempt|title=Publix launches its second e-commerce attempt|last=Enright|first=Allison|date=August 10, 2010|website=Internet Retailer Magazine|publisher=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Announced as a [[Pilot experiment|pilot program]] with locations in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta area]] and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], the program was ended in January 2012 after its performance reportedly did not meet expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.internetretailer.com/2012/01/06/publix-will-exit-e-commerce-second-time|title=Publix will exit e-commerce for a second time|last=Enright|first=Allison|date=January 6, 2012|website=Internet Retailer Magazine|publisher=|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company later resurrected its curbside concept, this time using its delivery partner, [[Instacart]], to manage the online ordering portion of the service. Currently in a [[Pilot experiment|trial]] stage, the second iteration of Publix Curbside began with two pilot locations in the [[Tampa Bay Area|greater Tampa area]] in September 2017, and is expected to expand to the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|greater Atlanta area]] by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=BusinessWire&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170927006336/en/Publix-Tests-Curbside-Grocery-Pickup|title=Publix Tests Curbside Grocery Pickup|last=|first=|date=September 27, 2017|website=BusinessWire|language=en|access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Instacart ====
In July 2016, Publix announced another [[Pilot experiment|pilot program]] with [[Instacart]] to offer online shopping and delivery services in the [[Miami metropolitan area|greater Miami]] area. Customers in 37 [[ZIP code]]s from [[Hallandale Beach, Florida|Hallandale Beach]] to [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]] are able to participate in the program. Not all products available at stores, such as [[tobacco]], [[gift card]]s, [[Prescription drug|prescriptions]], and age-restricted items, are able to be delivered by the service.&lt;!-- THIS IS THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE!

As of February 2017, Instacart deliveries from Publix are available in the metro areas of [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Atlanta]], [[Charlotte metropolitan area|Charlotte]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Publix/status/768779970780893185|title=Publix on Twitter|access-date=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miami metropolitan area|Miami]], [[Greater Orlando|Orlando]], [[Raleigh metropolitan area|Raleigh]], [[Tampa metropolitan area|Tampa]], [[Jacksonville metropolitan area|Jacksonville]], and [[Nashville metropolitan area|Nashville]], as determined by ZIP code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instacart.com/publix|title=Publix Grocery Delivery - Instacart|website=Instacart|language=en-US|access-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2017, Publix announced its intent to expand its delivery program, and expects to have the service available from more than 90 percent of stores by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=BusinessWire/&gt;

=== Food World ===
In response to other grocery stores' aggressive discounting across the Florida market, Publix opened its first Food World store in September 1970 in [[Orlando, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Publix - Shopping Pleasure in the 70's| url=http://pleasantfamilyshopping.blogspot.com/2009/09/publix-shopping-pleasure-in-seventies.html| date=September 10, 2009|  author=Dave Aldrich |work=Pleasant Family Shopping |accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store marked the first under the Food World banner for Publix and would become the first of 22 more of the type.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/publix-super-markets-inc-history/|title=Publix Super Markets Inc. History|date=200|work=International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 31.|publisher=St. James Press|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1977, in [[Lakeland, Florida]], Publix opened the Lake Miriam Food World, which, at 57,000 sq. ft., was its largest store in the company and also the largest store in the [[Southeastern United States|southeast]]. The store was the company's first to feature [[Barcode reader|barcode scanners]].

The brand was retired in 1985 because the stores were unable to turn a profit for Publix or give workers a percentage of their store's profits.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse/&gt;

=== Publix PIX ===
Starting in 2001, Publix operated 14 PIX (stylized in all-capitals) [[Filling station|gasoline]]-[[convenience store]]s in [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Tennessee]]. Locations were limited during the trial period of the concept. In 2014, all Florida and Georgia locations were sold to [[Circle K]], the sole Tennessee location was sold to another entity, and the concept was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20131023/news/131029728?tc=ar|title=Publix Plans to Sell Its Pix Stores|last=Pera|first=Eric|date=October 23, 2013|website=TheLedger.com|access-date=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The locations were converted to other brands, as Publix retains the rights to "PIX."&lt;!-- THIS IS THE COMPANY'S WEBSITE!

=== Crispers ===
In 2002, Publix invested in the Lakeland-based [[Chain store|restaurant chain]] [[Crispers (restaurant)|Crispers]], which concentrates on health-conscious fare. It increased its stake in 2004 before purchasing the remainder of the company in 2007. In May 2011, Publix announced it had sold the Crispers chain to Healthy Food Concepts LLC. The stores had not performed well during the downturn and in recent years Publix closed several units, leaving the chain with 36 stores when the sale was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Publix to sell Crispers| url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20110510/NEWS/110519969/1410?Title=Publix-to-Sell-Crispers| author=Kyle Kennedy| date=May 10, 2011| work=The Ledger|location=Lakeland, Florida| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publix Liquors ===
Publix tested the market response to liquor stores in the late 1980s, but closed its test sites in 1989. It re-entered the liquor sales market again in 2003 and has met with success since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030606/NEWS/306060343/1001/BUSINESS|title=Publix Opens Liquor Stores, Promotes 'Unique Service' in Ads|date=June 6, 2003|work=The Ledger|location=Lakeland, Florida|author=Mary Toothman|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The liquor store is in an area accessed via a separate entrance as required by local laws, modeled after many other grocery chains.

=== DVD rental kiosks ===
In September 2010, Publix reported it started adding [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] DVD rental kiosks to its stores, with the movie rentals starting at $1 per day. In 2010, Publix completed its rollout of Blockbuster Express kiosks to its stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theledger.com/article/20090925/NEWS/909255049/1178?Title=DVD-Kiosks-Are-Popping-Up-All-Over-Polk-County|title=DVD Kiosks Are Popping Up All Over Polk County|date=September 25, 2009|work=The Ledger|author=Kyle Kennedy|location=Lakeland, Florida|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] sold its entertainment division, which includes the Blockbuster Express kiosks, to [[CoinStar|Coinstar]], the owner of the [[Redbox]] DVD rental kiosks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/02/06/redbox-snatches-up-ncrs-entertainment-division-future-of-block/|title=Redbox snatches up NCR's entertainment division|date=February 6, 2012|work=Engadget|publisher=engadget.com|author=Terrence O'brien|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-57372197-261/redbox-pays-$100-million-for-ncrs-blockbuster-express/|title=Redbox pays $100 million for NCR's Blockbuster Express|date=February 6, 2012|work=CNET|publisher=CNET News|author=Greg Sandoval|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blockbuster Express machines were replaced with Redbox machines in most stores by the end of 2012.

=== Starbucks ===
In December 2016, Publix opened its first in-store [[Starbucks]] location in the Orlando area, with five more opening throughout 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/consumer/os-cfb-restaurant-retail-1226-20161222-story.html|title=Publix experimenting with Starbucks cafes|last=Arnold|first=Kyle|newspaper=OrlandoSentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publix.com/pages/starbucks|title=Starbucks|last=|first=|date=|website=Publix.com|publisher=|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/jacksonville/news/2017/01/18/publix-opens-its-first-in-store-starbucks-dozens.html|title=Publix opens its first in-store Starbucks, dozens more in pipeline (Photos) (Video)|last=Gurbal Kritzer|first=Ashley|date=January 18, 2017|website=www.bizjournals.com|publisher=Jacksonville Business Journal|access-date=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Publix Corporate Headquarters with clouds, Lakeland Florida.JPG|thumb|Corporate headquarters building]]
The company, founded in 1930, has never had a [[layoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2009/fortune/0901/gallery.no_layoffs.fortune/9.html|title=No layoffs -- ever!|website=Fortune|access-date=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Publix was sued "for sex discrimination in job assignments, promotions and allocation of hours" and settled for $81.5 million in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Publix Markets Settles Bias Suit for $81.5 Million|url = http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-25/business/fi-22037_1_publix-markets-settles-bias-suit|website = Los Angeles Times|accessdate = May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publix had claimed that the suit was simply an effort by the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] to unionize the company, but the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and required Publix to "correct some of its statements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Supermarket Chain To Pay $81 Million To Settle a Bias Suit|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/25/business/supermarket-chain-to-pay-81-million-to-settle-a-bias-suit.html|website = [[The New York Times]]|author=Myerson, Allen R.|date=January 25, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2018, student activists and survivors of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], including [[David Hogg (activist)|David Hogg]], planned a boycott of Publix, which would have included "die-in" protests at several Publix supermarkets, because of the $670,000 that the company made to [[Adam Putnam]], a Republican candidate for Florida governor and self-described "proud [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] sell-out"&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/05/25/publix-suspends-contributions-to-adam-putnam-amid-david-hoggs-anti-nra-protests/?noredirect=on|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 25, 2018|author=Eltagouri, Marwa|title=Publix halts donations to self-described ‘NRA sellout’ amid boycott, ‘die-in’ protests by David Hogg}}&lt;/ref&gt; who opposed new state gun restrictions created in response to the school shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-reg-adam-putnam-governor-forum-club-20180427-story.html|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|title=Adam Putnam champions 2nd Amendment, explains calling himself proud NRA sellout|date=April 30, 2018|author=Man, Anthony]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moments before the protests began, the company announced that it would suspend corporate-funded political contributions and reevaluate their political funding practices.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost/&gt;  Despite the company's announcement, David Hogg led a die-in on May 25, 2018 at a Publix supermarket with parents and students from [[Stoneman Douglas High School]] for 720 seconds, the approximate number of school shootings in recent history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/parkland/florida-school-shooting/fl-florida-school-shooting-publix-die-in-20180524-story.html|title=Publix halts campaign donations minutes before students stage 'die-in' protests|newspaper=Sun-Sentinel|date=May 25, 2018|author=Geggis, Anne Geggis; Barszewski, Larry; Shatzman, Marci}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Six days after halting political contributions, the [[Florida Retail Federation]], a trade group heavily funded (&gt;80% in 2017) by Publix, donated an additional $100,000 to Putnam's Florida Grown political action committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wolf, Colin|url=https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/06/08/a-lobbying-group-funded-almost-entirely-by-publix-just-gave-100k-to-proud-nra-sellout-adam-putnam|title=A lobbying group funded almost entirely by Publix just gave 100k to proud NRA sellout Adam Putnam|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date= June 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal disputes ==
In 2003, Publix supported a successful bill that prevents owners from suing if their land is polluted by dry cleaning chemicals dumped on an adjacent property, if the adjacent property owners are on a state clean-up list.  Publix lost a 2001 lawsuit filed by an owner whose property had been contaminated in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Bill: No suing over cleaning chemical| url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/03/10/State/Bill__No_suing_over_c.shtml| work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]| author=Julie Hauserman| date=March 10, 2003| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2005, Publix sued [[VISA (credit card)|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]], citing unfair business practices over their unannounced and non-negotiable increases in [[merchant account]] fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Publix sues Visa, MasterCard Over Intercharge Rates| author=Christine Van Dusen| url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/261239/publix_sues_visa_mastercard_over_interchange_rates| date=October 5, 2005| work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution| publisher=redOrbit.com| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wal-Mart]] won a similar lawsuit against Visa in 2004.

In 2014, Publix was fined by the Board of Human Rights of [[Broward County, Florida]] for discrimination involved in the termination of an [[LGBT]] employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2014/01/publix_ordered_to_pay_cake_dec.php|title=Publix Ordered to Pay Cake Decorator $100,000 for Firing Him Because He's Gay|publisher=Miami New Times|author=Michael E.

A '''Solander box''' ("S" may also be in lowercase), or '''clamshell case''' (mainly in [[American English]]), is a book-form case used for storing manuscripts, maps, prints, documents, old and precious books, etc. It is commonly used in [[archive]]s, [[print room]]s and [[library|libraries]]. It is named after the Swedish [[botanist]] [[Daniel Solander]] (1733–1782),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-link=Edward Duyker|first=Edward|last=Duyker|date=1998|title=Nature's Argonaut: Daniel Solander 1733-1782: Naturalist and Voyager with Cook and Banks|publisher=Melbourne University Press|ISBN=0-522-84753-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is credited with its construction while working at the [[British Museum]], where he catalogued the natural history collection between 1763 and 1782.

The case is usually constructed of [[hardcover]] or wood, and has a hinged lid connected to its base. Both lid and bottom sections of the box have three fixed side sections or "lips"; the lid is slightly larger so that the side pieces "nest" when the case is closed.   The fourth "spine" side has flexible joints where it joins the main top and bottom pieces and so goes flat onto the surface where the box is opened.  The front-edge of the case often contains a clasp for closure. The exterior is covered with heavy paper, fabric or leather, and its interior may be lined with padded paper or [[felt]], especially if made for a book.  All materials should be acid-free for conservation.  The depth of the box is normally about five inches, if it is not made for a specific object, and various standard sizes are made, with traditional names including "royal", "imperial", "elephant" and others.  Ones for very old books will typically be custom made to an exact size.  The boxes are stored flat, and are strong enough to be kept in small stacks.

A simplified and undecorated form of Solander box termed a "phase box" is used for temporary storage of books during [[conservation-restoration|conservation]] work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Easy do-it-yourself storage enclosures for books |url=http://archive.amol.org.au/recollections/1/2/13.htm |publisher=reCollections: Caring for Collections Across Australia] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731054232/http://archive.amol.org.au/recollections/1/2/13.htm |archivedate=July 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are constructed from plain mounting board. Although undecorated, the materials should still be of archival grade.

In [[quantum physics]], the '''spin–orbit interaction''' (also called '''spin–orbit effect''' or '''spin–orbit coupling''') is a [[Special relativity|relativistic]] interaction of a particle's [[spin (physics)|spin]] with its motion inside a [[Potential well|potential]]. A key example of this phenomenon is the spin–orbit interaction leading to shifts in an [[electron]]'s [[energy level|atomic energy levels]],  due to electromagnetic interaction between the electron's [[magnetic dipole]], its orbital motion, and the electrostatic field of the positively charged [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. This phenomenon is detectable as a splitting of [[spectral line]]s, which can be thought of as a [[Zeeman effect]] product of two relativistic effects: the apparent magnetic field seen from the electron perspective and the magnetic moment of the electron associated with its intrinsic spin.  A similar effect, due to the relationship between [[angular momentum]] and the [[strong nuclear force]], occurs for [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s moving inside the nucleus, leading to a shift in their energy levels in the nucleus [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]]. In the field of [[spintronics]], spin–orbit effects for electrons in [[semiconductor]]s and other materials are explored for technological applications. The spin–orbit interaction is one cause of [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]] and the [[spin Hall effect]].

For atoms, energy level split produced by the spin-orbit interaction is usually of the same order in size to the relativistic corrections to the [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energy]] and the [[zitterbewegung]] effect. The addition of these three corrections is known as the [[fine structure]]. Note that the spin-orbit effect is due to the electrostatic field of the electron and not the magnetic field created by its orbit. The interaction between the magnetic field created by the electron and the magnetic moment of the nucleus is a slighter correction to the energy levels known as the [[hyperfine structure]].

==In atomic energy levels==
This section presents a relatively simple and quantitative description of the spin–orbit interaction for an electron bound to a [[hydrogen-like atom]], up to first order in [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]], using some [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] [[electrodynamics]] and non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This gives results that agree reasonably well with observations. 

A rigorous calculation of the same result would use [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], using [[Dirac equation]], and would include [[Many-body problem|many-body interactions]]. Achieving an even more precise result would involve calculating small corrections from [[quantum electrodynamics]].

===Energy of a magnetic moment===
The energy of a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H = -\boldsymbol{\mu}\cdot\mathbf{B},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''μ''' is the [[magnetic moment]] of the particle, and '''B''' is the [[magnetic field]] it experiences.

===Magnetic field===

We shall deal with the [[magnetic field]] first. Although in the rest frame of the nucleus, there is no magnetic field acting on the electron, there ''is'' one in the rest frame of the electron (see [[classical electromagnetism and special relativity]]). Ignoring for now that this frame is not [[inertial]], in [[SI]] units we end up with the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = -\frac{\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{E}}{c^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where '''v''' is the velocity of the electron, and '''E''' is the electric field it travels through. Here, in the non-relativistic limit, we assume that the Lorentz factor &lt;math&gt;\gamma \backsimeq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Now we know that '''E''' is radial, so we can rewrite &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = | E / r | \mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt;.
Also we know that the momentum of the electron &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = m_\text{e} \mathbf{v} &lt;/math&gt;. Substituting this in and changing the order of the cross product gives

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}}{m_\text{e} c^2} \left| \frac{E}{r} \right|. &lt;/math&gt;

Next, we express the electric field as the gradient of the [[electric potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V&lt;/math&gt;.  Here we make the [[central field approximation]], that is, that the electrostatic potential is spherically symmetric, so is only a function of radius. This approximation is exact for hydrogen and hydrogen-like systems. Now we can say that

:&lt;math&gt;|E| = \frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = \frac{1}{e} \frac{\partial U(r)}{\partial r},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U = eV&lt;/math&gt; is the [[potential energy]] of the electron in the central field, and ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]]&lt;!-- QUESTION...or is it the negative of the elementary charge??? If so, minus signs are needed throughout...--&gt;.  Now we remember from classical mechanics that the [[angular momentum]] of a particle &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Putting it all together, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{m_\text{e} ec^2} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U(r)}{\partial r} \mathbf{L}. &lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note at this point that '''B''' is a positive number multiplied by '''L''', meaning that the [[magnetic field]] is parallel to the [[orbit]]al [[angular momentum]] of the particle, which is itself perpendicular to the particle's velocity.

===Magnetic moment of the electron===

The [[magnetic moment]] [[electron magnetic moment|of the electron]] is

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mu}_S = -g_\text{s} \mu_\text{B} \frac{\mathbf{S}}{\hbar},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; is the spin angular-momentum vector, &lt;math&gt;\mu_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr magneton]], and &lt;math&gt;g_\text{s} \approx 2&lt;/math&gt; is the electron-spin [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]]. Here &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is a negative constant multiplied by the [[spin (physics)|spin]], so the [[magnetic moment]] is antiparallel to the spin angular momentum.

The spin–orbit potential consists of two parts. The Larmor part is connected to the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the magnetic field of the nucleus in the co-moving frame of the electron. The second contribution is related to [[Thomas precession]].

===Larmor interaction energy===
The Larmor interaction energy is

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H_\text{L} = -\boldsymbol{\mu} \cdot \mathbf{B}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in this equation expressions for the magnetic moment and the magnetic field, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H_\text{L} = \frac{2\mu_\text{B}}{\hbar m_\text{e} e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U(r)}{\partial r} \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S}. &lt;/math&gt;

Now we have to take into account [[Thomas precession]] correction for the electron's curved trajectory.

===Thomas interaction energy===

In 1926 [[Llewellyn Thomas]] relativistically recomputed the doublet separation in the fine structure of the atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Llewellyn H.|author-link=Llewellyn Thomas|date=1926|title=The Motion of the Spinning Electron|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/117514a0|journal=Nature|language=|volume=117|issue=2945|pages=514–514|doi=10.1038/117514a0|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas precession rate &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega}_\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; is related to the angular frequency of the orbital motion &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; of a spinning particle as follows:&lt;ref&gt;L. Föppl and P. J. Daniell, ''Zur Kinematik des Born'schen starren Körpers'', Nachrichten von der Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, 519 (1913).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Møller|C. Møller]], ''The Theory of Relativity'', (Oxford at the Claredon Press, London, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\Omega}_\text{T} = \boldsymbol{\omega} (\gamma - 1),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the Lorentz factor of the moving particle. The Hamiltonian producing the spin 
precession &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\Omega}_\text{T}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta H_\text{T} = \boldsymbol{\Omega}_\text{T} \cdot \mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;

To the first order in &lt;math&gt;(v/c)^2&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H_\text{T} = -\frac{\mu_\text{B}}{\hbar m_\text{e} e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U(r)}{\partial r} \mathbf{L}\cdot \mathbf{S}. &lt;/math&gt;

===Total interaction energy===
The total spin–orbit potential in an external electrostatic potential takes the form 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H \equiv \Delta H_\text{L} + \Delta H_\text{T} = \frac{\mu_\text{B}}{\hbar m_\text{e} e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U(r)}{\partial r} \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S}. &lt;/math&gt;
The net effect of Thomas precession is the reduction of the Larmor interaction energy by factor 1/2, which came to be known as the ''Thomas half''.

===Evaluating the energy shift===
Thanks to all the above approximations, we can now evaluate the detailed energy shift in this model. Note that ''L''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; are no longer conserved quantities. In particular, we wish to find a new basis that diagonalizes both ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the non-perturbed Hamiltonian) and Δ''H''. To find out what basis this is, we first define the [[Azimuthal quantum number#Total angular momentum of an electron in the atom|total angular momentum]] [[Operator (physics)|operator]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{S}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the dot product of this with itself, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}^2 = \mathbf{L}^2 + \mathbf{S}^2 + 2\, \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;

(since '''L''' and '''S''' commute), and therefore

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} =
  \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{J}^2 - \mathbf{L}^2 - \mathbf{S}^2) 
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that the five operators ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, '''''J'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''L'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; all commute with each other and with Δ''H''. Therefore, the basis we were looking for is the simultaneous [[eigenbasis]] of these five operators (i.e., the basis where all five are diagonal). Elements of this basis have the five [[quantum number]]s: ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;'' (the "principal quantum number"), &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (the "total angular momentum quantum number"), ''&lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;'' (the "orbital angular momentum quantum number"), ''&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;'' (the "spin quantum number"), and &lt;math&gt;j_z&lt;/math&gt; (the "''z'' component of total angular momentum").

To evaluate the energies, we note that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \frac{1}{r^3} \right\rangle = \frac{2}{a^3 n^3\; \ell (\ell + 1) (2\ell + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

for hydrogenic wavefunctions (here &lt;math&gt;a = \hbar / (Z \alpha m_\text{e} c) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bohr radius]] divided by the nuclear charge ''Z''); and

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \right\rangle = \frac{1}{2} \big(\langle \mathbf{J}^2 \rangle - \langle \mathbf{L}^2 \rangle - \langle \mathbf{S}^2 \rangle\big) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2} \big(j (j + 1) - \ell (\ell + 1) - s (s + 1)\big).&lt;/math&gt;

===Final energy shift===

We can now say that

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E = \frac{\beta}{2} \big(j(j+1) - \ell(\ell+1) - s(s+1)\big),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \beta(n,l) = Z^4 \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} g_\text{s} \mu_\text{B}^2 \frac{1}{n^3 a_0^3\;\ell(\ell+1/2)(\ell+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

For the exact relativistic result, see the [[hydrogen-like atom#Solution to Dirac equation|solutions to the Dirac equation for a hydrogen-like atom]].

==In solids==
{{Technical|section|date=December 2017}}
A crystalline solid (semiconductor, metal etc.) is characterized by its [[band structure]]. While on the overall scale (including the core levels) the spin–orbit interaction is still a small perturbation, it may play a relatively more important role if we zoom in to bands close to the [[Fermi level]] (&lt;math&gt;E_\text{F}&lt;/math&gt;). The atomic &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt; (spin-orbit) interaction, for example, splits bands that would be otherwise degenerate, and the particular form of this spin–orbit splitting (typically of the order of few to few hundred millielectronvolts) depends on the particular system. The bands of interest can be then described by various effective models, usually based on some perturbative approach. An example of how the atomic spin–orbit interaction influences the band structure of a crystal is explained in the article about [[Rashba effect|Rashba]] and [[Dresselhaus effect|Dresselhaus]] interactions.

In crystalline solid contained paramagnetic ions, e.g. ions with unclosed d or f atomic subshell, localized electronic states exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Electron Paramagnetic Resonance of Transition Ions|author1=A.

Griffith |publisher=The Theory of Transition Metal Ions, Cambridge University Press|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, atomic-like electronic levels structure is shaped by intrinsic magnetic spin–orbit interactions and interactions with [[Crystal field theory|crystalline electric fields]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The effective crystal field potential|last=J. Mulak, Z. Gajek|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd, Kidlington, Oxford, UK|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such structure is named [[Fine electronic structure|the fine electronic structure]]. For [[rare-earth]] ions the spin–orbit interactions are much stronger than the CEF interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry Rare Earth Vol. 2|last=Fulde|publisher=North-Holland. Inc. (1979)|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong spin–orbit coupling makes ''J'' a relatively good quantum number, because the first excited multiplet is at least ~130&amp;nbsp;meV (1500&amp;nbsp;K) above the primary multiplet. The result is that filling it at room temperature (300&amp;nbsp;K) is negligibly small. In this case, a (2''J'' + 1)-fold degenerated primary multiplet split by an external [[Crystal field theory|crystal electric field]] (CEF) can be treated as the basic contribution to the analysis of such systems' properties. In the case of approximate calculations for basis &lt;math&gt;|J,J_z\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, to determine which is the primary multiplet, the [[Friedrich Hund|Hund]] principles, known from atomic physics, are applied:

* The ground state of the terms' structure has the maximal value ''S'' allowed by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].
* The ground state has a maximal allowed ''L'' value, with maximal ''S''.
* The primary multiplet has a corresponding ''J'' = |''L'' − ''S''| when the shell is less than half full, and ''J'' = ''L'' + ''S'', where the fill is greater.

The ''S'', ''L'' and ''J'' of the ground multiplet are determined by [[Hund's rules]]. The ground multiplet is 2''J'' + 1 degenerated – its degeneracy is removed by CEF interactions and magnetic interactions. CEF interactions and magnetic interactions resemble, somehow, [[Stark effect|Stark]] and [[Zeeman effect]] known from [[atomic physics]]. The energies and eigenfunctions of the discrete fine electronic structure are obtained by diagonalization of the (2''J'' + 1)-dimensional matrix. The fine electronic structure can be directly detected by many different spectroscopic methods, including the [[inelastic neutron scattering]] (INS) experiments.

The energies and eigenfunctions of the discrete fine electronic structure (for the lowest term) are obtained by diagonalization of the (''2L + 1)(2S + 1)''-dimensional matrix. At zero temperature (''T'' = 0&amp;nbsp;K) only the lowest state is occupied. The magnetic moment at ''T'' = 0&amp;nbsp;K is equal to the moment of the ground state. It allows evaluate the total, spin and orbital moments. The eigenstates and corresponding eigenfunctions &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma_n\rangle&lt;/math&gt; can be found from direct diagonalization of Hamiltonian matrix containing crystal field and spin–orbit interactions. Taking into consideration the thermal population of states, the thermal evolution of the single-ion properties of the compound is established. This technique is based on the equivalent operator theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operator methods in ligand field theory|last=Watanabe|first=Hiroshi|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as the CEF widened by thermodynamic and analytical calculations defined as the supplement of the CEF theory by including thermodynamic and analytical calculations.

===Examples of effective Hamiltonians===

Hole bands of a bulk (3D) zinc-blende semiconductor will be split by &lt;math&gt;\Delta_0&lt;/math&gt; into heavy and light holes (which form a &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_8&lt;/math&gt; quadruplet in the &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;-point of the Brillouin zone) and a split-off band (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_7&lt;/math&gt; doublet). Including two conduction bands (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_6&lt;/math&gt; doublet in the &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;-point), the system is described by the effective eight-band [[Luttinger–Kohn model|model of Kohn and Luttinger]]. If only top of the valence band is of interest (for example when &lt;math&gt;E_\text{F}\ll \Delta_0&lt;/math&gt;, Fermi level measured from the top of the valence band),  the proper four-band effective model is

:&lt;math&gt;H_\text{KL}(k_\text{x},k_\text{y},k_\text{z})=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\left[(\gamma_1+{\textstyle\frac52 \gamma_2}) k^2 - 
2\gamma_2(J_\text{x}^2k_\text{x}^2+J_\text{y}^2k_\text{y}^2
+J_\text{z}^2k_\text{z}^2) -2\gamma_3 \sum_{m \ne n}J_mJ_nk_mk_n\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{1,2,3}&lt;/math&gt; are the Luttinger parameters (analogous to the single effective mass of a one-band model of electrons) and &lt;math&gt;J_{\text{x},\text{y},\text{z}}&lt;/math&gt; are angular momentum 3/2 matrices (&lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the free electron mass). In combination with magnetization, this type of spin–orbit interaction will distort the electronic bands depending on the magnetization direction, thereby causing [[magnetocrystalline anisotropy]] (a special type of [[magnetic anisotropy]]).
If the semiconductor moreover lacks the inversion symmetry, the hole bands will exhibit cubic Dresselhaus splitting. Within the four bands (light and heavy holes), the dominant term is

:&lt;math&gt;H_{\text{D}3}=b_{41}^{8\text{v}8\text{v}}[(k_\text{x}k_\text{y}^2-k_\text{x}k_\text{z}^2)J_\text{x}+(k_\text{y}k_\text{z}^2-k_\text{y}k_\text{x}^2)J_\text{y}+(k_\text{z}k_\text{x}^2-k_\text{z}k_\text{y}^2)J_\text{z}]
&lt;/math&gt;

where the material parameter &lt;math&gt;b_{41}^{8\text{v}8\text{v}} = -81.93 \,\text{meV} \cdot \text{nm}^3&lt;/math&gt; for GaAs (see pp.&amp;nbsp;72 in Winkler's book, according to more recent data the Dresselhaus constant in GaAs is 9 eVÅ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krich|first=Jacob J.|last2=Halperin|first2=Bertrand I.|date=2007|title=Cubic Dresselhaus Spin-Orbit Coupling in 2D Electron Quantum Dots|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.226802|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=98|issue=22|pages=|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.226802|via=|arxiv=cond-mat/0702667}}&lt;/ref&gt; the total Hamiltonian will be &lt;math&gt;H_\text{KL}+H_{\text{D}3}&lt;/math&gt;). [[2DEG|Two-dimensional electron gas]] in an asymmetric quantum well (or heterostructure) will feel the Rashba interaction. The appropriate two-band effective Hamiltonian is

:&lt;math&gt;
H_0+H_\text{R} = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*} \sigma_0 + \alpha (k_\text{y} \sigma_\text{x} - k_\text{x}\sigma_\text{y})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; is the 2 × 2 identity matrix, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{x},\text{y}}&lt;/math&gt; the Pauli matrices and &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; the electron effective mass. The spin–orbit part of the Hamiltonian, &lt;math&gt;H_\text{R}&lt;/math&gt; is parametrized by &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, sometimes called the Rashba parameter (its definition somewhat varies), which is related to the structure asymmetry. 

Above expressions for spin–orbit interaction couple spin matrices &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{J}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; to the quasi-momentum &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and to the vector potential &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{A}&lt;/math&gt; of an AC electric field through the [[Peierls substitution]] &lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol{k}}=-i\nabla-(\frac{e}{\hbar c}){\boldsymbol{A}}&lt;/math&gt;. They are lower order terms of the Luttinger–Kohn [[k·p perturbation theory]] in powers of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Next terms of this expansion also produce terms that couple spin operators of the electron coordinate &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{r}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, a cross product &lt;math&gt;(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\times{\boldsymbol{k}})&lt;/math&gt; is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] with respect to time inversion. In cubic crystals, it has a symmetry of a vector and acquires a meaning of a spin–orbit contribution &lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol{r}}_{\text{SO}}&lt;/math&gt; to the operator of coordinate. For electrons in semiconductors with a narrow gap &lt;math&gt;E_G&lt;/math&gt; between the conduction and heavy hole bands, Yafet derived the equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Yafet|first=Y.|title=g Factors and Spin-Lattice Relaxation of Conduction Electrons|date=1963|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0081194708602593|work=Solid State Physics|pages=1–98|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0081-1947(08)60259-3|isbn=9780126077148|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is a free electron mass, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;-factor properly renormalized for spin–orbit interaction. This operator couples electron spin &lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol{S}}=\tfrac{1}{2}{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}&lt;/math&gt; directly to the electric field &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{E}&lt;/math&gt; through the interaction energy &lt;math&gt;-e({\boldsymbol{r}}_{\text{SO}}\cdot{\boldsymbol{E}})&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Oscillating electromagnetic field ===
[[Electric dipole spin resonance]] (EDSR) is the coupling of the electron spin with an oscillating electric field. Similar to the [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|electron spin resonance]] (ESR) in which electrons can be excited with an electromagnetic wave with the energy given by the [[Zeeman effect]], in EDSR the resonance can be achieved if the frequency is related to the energy band split given by the spin-orbit coupling in solids. While in ESR the coupling is obtained via the magnetic part of the EM wave with the electron magnetic moment, the ESDR is the coupling of the electric part with the spin and motion of the electrons. This mechanism has been proposed for controlling the spin of electrons in [[quantum dot]]s and other [[Mesoscopic physics|mesoscopic systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rashba|first=Emmanuel I.|author-link=Emmanuel Rashba|date=2005|title=Spin Dynamics and Spin Transport|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10948-005-3349-8|journal=Journal of Superconductivity|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=137–144|doi=10.1007/s10948-005-3349-8|issn=0896-1107|via=|arxiv=cond-mat/0408119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sterculia foetida''''' is a soft wooded tree that can grow up to 35 metres (115 ft.) tall.&lt;ref name="Meet the Plants"&gt;"[http://www.ntbg.org/plants/plant_details.php?plantid=10732 Sterculia Foetida"]  - Meet the Plants - National Tropical Botanical Garden Plant Database.  Web. 08 Dec. 2013.
&lt;/ref&gt; It was described in 1753 by [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359029#page/450/mode/1up |title=vol. 2 - Caroli Linnaei ... Species plantarum - Biodiversity Heritage Library |publisher=Biodiversitylibrary.org |date=2013-05-30 |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common names for the plant are the '''bastard poon tree''', '''java olive tree''', '''hazel sterculia''', and '''wild almond tree'''.&lt;ref name="Meet the Plants" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/Sea/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=98 |title=Species Information |publisher=Worldagroforestry.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Sterculia]]'' and both names mean bad-smelling: the origin of ''Sterculia'' comes from the Roman god, [[Sterquilinus]], who was the god of fertilizer or manure.

==Description==
The branches of ''Sterculia foetida'' are arranged in [[whorl (biology)|whorl]]s; they spread horizontally. The tree's bark is smooth and grey. The leaves are placed at the end of branchlets; they have 125–230 mm long [[petiole (botany)|petioles]]; the blades are palmately compound, containing 7-9 leaflets. The leaflets are elliptical, 100–170 mm long, and shortly petioluled  The petioles are the source of the foul smell of the plant. &lt;ref name="Description"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb/AFTPDFS/Sterculia_foetida.pdf |title=Sterculia foetida |publisher=Worldagroforestry.org |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The flowers are arranged in [[panicles]], 100–150&amp;nbsp;mm long. The green or purple flowers are large and unisexual as the tree is [[dioecy|dioecious]] (male and female flowers are found on different trees). The [[sepal|calyx]] is dull orange and is divided into five [[sepal|sepals]], each one 10-13&amp;nbsp;mm long. The fruit consists of four to five [[follicle (fruit)|follicles]], each follicle generally containing 10-15 seeds. The follicles are scarlet when ripe.&lt;ref name="Description" /&gt;
In India, flowers appear in March, and the leaves appear between March and April. At Hyderabad (India), flowering was observed in September-October (2015) with ripened fruits on the top part and young green fruits at the lower branches. The fruit is ripe in February (11 months after the flowers appeared).&lt;ref name="Description" /&gt;

==Uses==
The oil of ''Sterculia foetida'' has been found to be comparable to [[sunflower]], [[soybean]], and rapeseed oils for the use of [[biofuel]]s. ''Sterculia foetida'' oil contains [[cyclopropene]] [[fatty acid]]s such as 8,9 methylene-heptadec-8-enoic acid ([[malvalic acid]]) and 9,10-methylene-ocadec-9-enoic acid ([[sterculic acid]]). The [[flash point]], [[iodine]] value, free fatty acid count, [[phosphorus]] content, [[cloud point]], [[pour point]], [[viscosity]] at 40&amp;nbsp;°C, oxidative stability at 110&amp;nbsp;°C, [[density]], and trace metal count are all within [[ASTM]] and [[European standards|EN]] specifications.&lt;ref&gt;''[[J Am Oil Chem Soc]]'' (2012) '''89''':891–896&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests that the seeds of ''Sterculia foetida'' are edible, but they should be roasted prior to eating.&lt;ref&gt;Staples, G. W. &amp; D. R. Herbst. 2005. A Tropical Garden Flora.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
''Sterculia foetida'' has been found in many areas. These aforementioned areas are India, [[Taiwan]], [[Indochina]], the [[Philippines]] (where it is known as '''''kalumpang'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stuartxchange.org/Kalumpang.html|title=Kalumpang, Sterculia foetida, wild almond, Xiang ping po: Philippine Herbal Medicine / Philippine Alternative Medicine|website=www.stuartxchange.org|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;),  [[United States]] ([[Hawaii]]), [[Indonesia]], [[Ghana]], [[Australia]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Togo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.gbif.org/species/5406675 |title=Sterculia foetida L. - Checklist View |publisher=Gbif.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bamboo Flooring.jpg|thumb|right|Bamboo flooring]]
'''Sustainable flooring''' is produced from sustainable materials (and by a sustainable process) that reduces demands on [[ecosystems]] during its life-cycle.{{says who?|date=September 2017}} This includes harvest, production, use and disposal. It is thought that sustainable flooring creates safer and healthier buildings and guarantees a future for traditional producers of [[renewable resources]] that many communities depend on.{{says who?|date=September 2017}} Several initiatives have led the charge to bring awareness of sustainable flooring as well as healthy buildings (air quality).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsc.org/ Forest Stewardship Council], FSC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pefc.org/ The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification], PEFC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfiprogram.org/ Sustainable Forestry Initiative], SFI&lt;/ref&gt; Below are examples of available, though sometimes less well-known, eco-friendly [[flooring]] options.&lt;ref&gt;Luetdke A. (2002). Floor coverings, dust and airborne contaminants. Available: http://www.flooringsciences.org/e-journal/0407/0407_Luedtke_Dust-Airborne-Contaminants.pdf. Last accessed 16 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DEFRA. (2009). What is sustainable development?. Available: http://www.defra.gov.uk/sustainable/government/what/index.htm. Last accessed 16 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brenda&amp;Robert Vale (2000),

Last accessed 16 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America recommends those with allergies to dust or other particulates choose flooring with smooth surfaces – such as hardwood, vinyl, linoleum tile or slate.

In the U.S., the Building for Energy and Environmental Sustainability (BEES) program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/el/economics/BEESSoftware.cfm BEES software]&lt;/ref&gt; provides a one-stop source of life cycle assessment-based information about flooring options. Life cycle comparisons of flooring alternatives by research groups around the world consistently show bio-based flooring products to have lower environmental impacts than other types of flooring. The life cycle environmental impacts associated with producing and using flooring alternatives such as cork, linoleum, and solid wood are clearly lower than other alternatives. Wool carpeting and composite marble exhibit the greatest impacts, and impacts linked to typical carpeting used in residential structures are higher than those shown in the BEES system due to the use of a pad under the carpet layer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dovetailinc.org/files/DovetailFloors0809.pdf Dovetail Partners Life  Cycle Assessment of Flooring Materials: A Guide to Intelligent Selection]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wood ==
The development of [[life cycle assessment]]  methodology in the early 1990s has shown the environmental advantages of wood and wood-based products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/y3609e/y3609e04.htm#P222_14894 FAO Corporate Document Repository Comparison between wood, PVC and linoleum flooring]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood is a unique and renewable material. Trees absorb carbon during their growing cycle, and this carbon remains stored in products like wood flooring during its service life, thus keeping it out of the atmosphere. At the end of its service life, wood can be reused (in which case the carbon continues to be stored in the wood) or used for fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwfa.org/member/pdf/LCA_solid_wood_FINAL_REPORT.pdf CORRIM Phase II Final Report Life-Cycle Inventory of Solid Strip Hardwood Flooring in the Eastern United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

A life cycle assessment of flooring materials made of solid wood, linoleum and vinyl found the wood flooring had lower energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. It also performed better in environmental impact categories such as resource use, environmental toxin emissions, air pollution emissions and waste generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V23-3WDCCKY-9&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F1997&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=5a455d35f8f55b9185b95a9c136dd026&amp;searchtype=a Science Direct Life Cycle Assessment of Flooring Materials: Case Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reclaimed Wood Flooring ===
[[File:Reclaimed Wood Floor.jpg|alt=reclaimed wood, reclaimed barn wood, reclaimed flooring|thumb|Reclaimed mixed hardwoods floor]]
When [[reclaimed wood]] is used for wood flooring, it is taken for reuse from many different sources, including old warehouses, boxcars, coal mines, gymnasiums, homes, wine barrels, historic barns, and more. Wood can also be recovered from rivers in the form of fallen trees along with logs that were once sent downstream by lumber mills.

Using reclaimed wood can earn credits towards achieving [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] project certification. Because reclaimed wood is considered recycled content, it meets the Materials &amp; Resources criteria for LEED certification and because some reclaimed lumber products are FSC certified, they can qualify for LEED credits under the "certified wood" category&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CategoryID=19 LEED]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides qualifying for LEED points, reclaimed wood is drawing an increasing number of home and business owners, architects, and contractors to choosing reclaimed wood flooring for a few significant reasons:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reclaimedbarnwood.com/reclaimed-barn-wood-advantages|title=10 Reasons to Use Reclaimed Barn Wood in Your Next Project|work=ReclaimedBarnwood.com {{!}} Distinguished Boards and Beams|access-date=2017-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·      Environmental responsibility and sustainability

·      Old growth wood is present in reclaimed examples in a time when it is increasingly difficult to source newly cut old growth lumber due to environmental protections and diminished availability

·      Old growth, tight growth rings found in many historic structures adds durability and aesthetic value to flooring

·      Client demand for green building materials has greatly increased since 2015

·      Developing countries are showing significant increases in green building certification&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.marketing.construction.com/Web/McGrawHillConstruction/%7B9cae5ab2-4ea8-429d-915d-49bc72212ebc%7D_World_Green_Building_Trends_2016_SmartMarket_Report_FINAL.PDF|title=World Green Building Trends 2016|last=Dodge Analytics|first=United Technologies|date=2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bamboo flooring ==

[[Bamboo flooring]] is made from a fast-growing renewable "timber" ([[bamboo]] is actually a grass). It is natural anti-bacterial, water-resistant and extremely durable. [[DIY]] installation is easy, as bamboo flooring is available with tongue-and-groove technology familiar in hardwood/laminate alternatives. Bamboo flooring is often more expensive than [[laminate]], though it is generally cheaper than traditional hardwood flooring. Some bamboo floors are less sustainable than others, as they contain the toxic substance [[formaldehyde]] (rather than natural-base adhesives).&lt;ref&gt;BuildingGreen. (2008). Bamboo Flooring . Available: http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2008/9/16/Bamboo-Flooring/. Last accessed 16 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cork Flooring ==
Cork flooring is made by removing the bark of the [[Cork Oak]] ''(Quercus Suber)'' without harming the tree (if harvested correctly); as such, it is a renewable and sustainable resource. It is naturally anti-microbial and has excellent insulation properties, ensuring minimal heat loss and comfortable warm walking surface. Cork is resilient and 'springs back' preventing imprints due to heavy traffic and furniture, it also provides excellent noise insulation. While cork itself is low in [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOC) emissions, it is important to check the finish applied. Cork is not suitable for bathrooms, as it absorbs moisture.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, S. (2008).'' Sustainable Construction''.Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rainforest Alliance. (2005). Put a Sustainable Cork in It. Available: http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/news/2005/cork_new.html. Last accessed 16 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linoleum ==

[[Linoleum]] is made from dried and milled flax seeds mixed with other plant material (pine resins, [[wood flour]], ground cork) with a jute backing, all completely natural materials which come from renewable sources and are 100% biodegradable. All by products and waste is milled and used.  Linoleum does not fade, as the pigments are embedded in the structure. It is anti-static, repelling dirt, dust and other small particles, making it hypoallergenic – for this reason it is often used by people with respiratory issues (asthma, allergies).  It is also fire-resistant and does not require additional fire-retardants finish.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainability at work. (2007). Carillion - Sustainability and flooring - linoleum vs vinyl. Available: http://www.sustainabilityatwork.org.uk/casestudies/view/39. Last accessed 16 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rubber Flooring ==
[[File:Dunamis Therapy and Fitness.jpg|thumb|Dunamis Therapy and Fitness using Greatmats recycled rubber flooring in its weight training area.]]

Rubber flooring used to be made from a [[rubber tree]], a 100% renewable resource. Today [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber (SBR), a general-purpose [[synthetic rubber]], produced from a copolymer of styrene and butadiene is used for "rubber flooring" It is easy to install and maintain, is anti-static and provides effective sound insulation and vibration reduction.
Rubber flooring is also resistant to fading and cigarette burns. Most rubber flooring is made from synthetic rubber, which is not a sustainable product.&lt;ref&gt;Eco Reports. (2009). Dalsouple Rubber Flooring. Available: http://www.ecoreports.co.uk/organisations/details.aspx?id=61. Last accessed 16 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural and Recycled Carpet ==

There are carpets that are sustainable, using natural fibers such as cotton, sisal, wool, jute and coconut husk. Handmade Citapore rugs include a wide range of sustainable flooring material as these rugs are generally made from cotton (both virgin and recycled), jute, rayon and cotton chennile. It is also possible to have carpet made completely from recycled [[polyethylene terephthalate]] used for food/drink containers. Recycled nylon is also a common material used and the process takes carpet made with nylon 6 fibers and recycles it into brand new nylon carpet. This process can be repeated numerous times and in 2009 alone, Shaw's Evergreen facility recycled over 100 million pounds of carpet. This is sustainable and it reduces material sent to landfill; further it uses dyeing methods that are less polluting and require less energy than other flooring. This flooring is sustainable when used alongside eco-friendly adhesive, as some products may have toxic finishes added (stain/fireproofing) that are not considered sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;ED+C.

== Coconut timber flooring ==
[[Coconut timber]] is a hardwood substitute from coconut palm trees. Coconut palm wood flooring is cheaper than teak, with the wood hardness comparable to mahogany. Coconut palm wood is made from matured (60 to 80 years old) coconut palm trees that no longer bear fruits.

*Reclaimed Flooring Parquet
*This Parquet Flooring in Herringbone, Double Herringbone, as well as Chevron style can be reclaimed from buildings typically undergoing demolition or renovation. Typically the flooring has been in its original home for over 100 years. Occasionally very rare woods, including old growth Teak, Mahoganies, or Oaks are used, sometimes more exotic timbers such as Panga, Wenge, Bubinga and others are utilized. 
*Some of these woods [Rhodesian Teak] are simply not in production any more, due to forestry or importation limits. 
*Process of reclamation includes salvage, transport, cleaning of old bitumen residue, Re-fitting and re-sanding with finishing by lacquering or oiling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1013">'''Tolerance coning''' is the engineering discipline of creating a budget of all tolerances that potentially add/subtract to affect adequacy of a particular parameter.  This is particularly critical where stages of design/manufacture precede test/use.

For example, when setting a test limit for a measurement on each manufactured item of some type, to assure that no bad items are shipped, the limit must be tighter than the requirement to allow for the worst case sum of measurement inaccuracies (e.g. equipment, [[test fixture]] etc.).  The design of the item thus has to take into account not only the product requirement but also the test tolerances.  The buildup of this budget is tolerance coning.
 
Electronics engineers intuitively do tolerance coning and tend to formalise it for critical parameters.  However it is also relevant to other engineering disciplines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4694">'''Tourism Radio''' is a [[travel]] technology company based in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], which produces location-based technology used in customized [[GPS]] in-car devices and [[IOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile applications. The technology allows the user to take a tour of a city or pre-defined area, with geo-located, pre-recorded audio travel information triggering automatically as the user approaches them.  The Tourism Radio in-car device plugs into a standard vehicle cigarette lighter and broadcasts a selection of local and international music along with location-specific travel information about the area the vehicle is driving through. Currently, there are approximately 3,300 of these devices used in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Angola]]. Distribution of the devices to tourists is done in partnership with local Destination Marketing Organisations (DMOs) and car/motorhome rental agencies. The [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] applications do not broadcast a selection of music, but use the same geo-location principle to give the user relevant travel information about the area they are in. This includes information about a general area or suburb, as well as information about specific [[points of interest]], such as museums, art galleries, historical attractions, restaurants, nature walks, beaches, etc.

== About ==

Started in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] in 2005 by founder and current CEO, Mark Allewell, Tourism Radio was originally created on the concept of touring a city without a tour guide. Allewell used his home town of [[Cape Town]] as his starting point, and worked on the development of a [[GPS]] device which would play information on points of interest as the user approached them. Months of research and development led to the creation of a bespoke, in-car device. This could play through an ordinary [[car radio]] sound system and would play audio information about important sights as they were passed by the vehicle. After a positive local and international response, the company was bought by a German [[angel investor]] and expanded operations to [[Spain]] and [[New Zealand]]. Tourism Radio has since focused on becoming a key player in the digital world by creating [[mobile apps]], with a keen focus on free-to-download audio city guides, for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.These apps served as a proving ground for Tourism Radio, and led to the development of white label apps for DMOs and corporate entities looking to target the [[tourism industry]]. These use Tourism Radio’s technology and are coupled with client-provided content to create company-specific apps.

== Technology ==

Tourism Radio offers the use of its location-based technology in form of the [[in-car]] Tourism Radio devices and its [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] applications.The company has patented its real-world and mobile geo-location technology in [[New Zealand]] and [[Europe]], with [[patents pending]] in [[North America]] and elsewhere.Tourism Radio also features as application software on the [[Renault]] R-Link in-car multimedia system. Tourism Radio uses the R-Link's inbuilt [[GPS]] system to provide drivers with information about [[tourist attractions]] in their vicinity.The Tourism Radio mobile applications for Android and iOS allow the user to download a travel guide and then use it completely [[offline]].

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Capital1961&gt;Mickle, Paul. [http://www.capitalcentury.com/1961.html "1961: A peep into the automated future"], ''[[The Trentonian]]''. Accessed August 11, 2011. "Without any fanfare, the world's first working robot joined the assembly line at the General Motors plant in Ewing Township in the spring of 1961.... It was an automated die-casting mold that dropped red-hot door handles and other such car parts into pools of cooling liquid on a line that moved them along to workers for trimming and buffing. Its most distinct feature was a grip on a steel armature that eliminated the need for a man to touch car parts just made from molten steel."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was invented by [[George Devol]] in the 1950s using his original patent filed in 1954 and granted in 1961 ({{US Patent|2,988,237}}). The patent begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The present invention relates to the automatic operation of machinery, particularly the handling apparatus, and to automatic control apparatus suited for such machinery.&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Rebecca J. [https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/unimate-the-story-of-george-devol-and-the-first-robotic-arm/243716/ "Unimate: The Story of George Devol and the First Robotic Arm"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Devol, together with [[Joseph Engelberger]], his business associate, started the world's first robot manufacturing company, [[Unimation]].&lt;ref name=first&gt;[http://www.capitalcentury.com/1961.html 1961: The First Robot]&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine undertook the job of transporting [[die casting]]s from an assembly line and welding these parts on auto bodies, a dangerous task for workers, who might be poisoned by toxic fumes or lose a limb if they were not careful.&lt;ref name=Capital1961/&gt;

The original Unimate consisted of a large computer-like box, joined to another box and was connected to an arm, with [[Task (computers)|systematic tasks]] stored in a [[drum memory]].

The Unimate also appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' hosted by [[Johnny Carson]] on  which it knocked a golf ball into a cup, poured a beer, waved the orchestra conductor's baton and grasped an accordion and waved it around.&lt;ref name=first /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKo6KMkuVAk Video clip of Unimate on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113174852/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKo6KMkuVAk |date=January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2003 in science|2003]] the Unimate was inducted into the [[Robot Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robothalloffame.org/inductees/03inductees/unimate.html The Robot Hall of Fame: Unimate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Fictional robots called ''Unimate'', designed by the character ''Alan von Neumann, Jr.'', appeared in comic books from [[DC Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #21 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utilization in engineering==
In [[engineering]] utilization or operational stage of a system or equipment [[System lifecycle|life-cycle]] is a period of time when their quality is realized in practical use to achieve intended objectives and supported by accomplishment of storage, [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance, repair]], etc. Subsequently, the term "utilization" may have two meaning depending on context: 1) a process of actual use of a system or equipment - in case of simple products and 2) a stage of a complex [[System lifecycle|product life-cycle]] - in case of use within the [[product life-cycle management]] processes. &lt;ref name="NATO_AAP48"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.fhi.nl/plot2012/archief/2010/images/aap-48e.pdf |title=NATO Standard AAP 48. System Life Cycle Stages and Processes |last= |first= |date=2007 |website= fhi.nl|language=EN |publisher=[[NATO]] |access-date=2018-01-11 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OxLD"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/utilization |website=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |language=EN |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2018-01-11 |title=Utilization|quote=Utilization (British "utilisation"), noun. The action of making practical and effective use of something}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rental utilization==
In [[Rental management software|equipment and tool rental companies]], '''utilization''' is the primary method by which asset performance is measured and business success determined. In basic terms it is a measure of the actual revenue earned by assets against the potential revenue they could have earned.&lt;ref&gt;http://constructionequipmentdistribution.com/article-detail.cfm?id=10921486 Utilization is key to rental business&lt;/ref&gt; Rental utilization is divided into a number of different calculations, and not all companies work precisely the same way. In general terms however there are 2 key calculations: the '''physical utilization''' on the asset, which is measured based on the number of available days for rental against the number of days actually rented. (This may also be measured in hours for certain types of equipment), and the '''financial utilization''' on the asset (referred to in North America as $ Utilization) which is measured as the rental revenue achieved over a period of time against the potential revenue that could have been achieved based on a target or standard, non-discounted rate. Physical utilization is also sometimes referred to as '''spot utilization''', where a rental company looks at its current utilization of assets based on a single moment in time (e.g. now, 9 am today, etc.).

Utilization calculations may be varied based on many different factors. For example: 
* A company with equipment which requires [[Preventative Maintenance|preventative maintenance]] activities every 2 weeks, may decide that the number of available days in the month is decreased as it will unavailable due to maintenance for 2 days out of each month.
* Some rental businesses give "free days" on rental contract [[Invoicing|billing]] processes, for example on a national or public holiday, and therefore the equipment does not earn any money on those days, even though it is physically on rent.
* Some companies charge minimum rates, for example you may rent an excavator for 1 day, but be charged a three-day minimum. The Physical utilization will therefore be 100% on the day, but the financial utilization is actually 300% as you've earned 3 days revenue for 1 day's work.
* [[Rental management software|Rental Software]] is normally required to assist management teams in measuring and calculating utilization figures.
* [[Mobile asset management|Asset Tracking software]] may also be important in increasing or managing utilization figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Qualcomm|url=http://www.qualcomm.com/common/documents/white_papers/QUALCOMM-WP-EquipmentRental.pdf  |title= Using technology to improve utilization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilization in this context is heavily linked to [[Accounting|profitability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cedmag.com/article-detail.cfm?id=10922778 |title= How to improve results|work=CED Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low physical utilization may be mitigated by keeping rental rates high, high physical utilization normally justifies keeping rental rates lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rentalmanagementmag.com/newsart.asp?ARTID=1509  |title=Close correlation between utilization and rental rates|work=Rental Management Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of equipment may also alter the relationship between rates and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=RentalPulse|url=http://www.rentalpulse.com/article.asp?ARTID=6519 |title=How utilization affects profitability}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credit utilization==
Credit utilization is defined as the ratio of an entity's [[credit card]] and [[revolving loan]] balances to their [[credit limit]]s; in other words, it represents the amount of their credit limit that is being used. Credit utilization is one of several factors typically used by [[Credit score|credit scoring]] models because it is often correlated with [[Credit risk|lending risk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=August 30, 2018|title=Understanding Credit Utilization: Credit Utilization and How It Affects Your Credit Score|url=https://www.thebalance.com/understanding-credit-utilization-960451|website=The Balance|date=July 10, 2018|author=Irby, LaToya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Credit Karma|url=https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/credit-card-utilization-and-your-credit-score/ |title=Credit card utilization and your credit scores|date=July 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Washdown''' (also '''wash down''') is the process of high-pressure cleaning with water and/or chemicals in industries such as food and beverage and [[pharmaceutical]]s. A washdown is usually a manual operation and is designed to kill [[bacteria]] and other [[microorganism]]s. Automatic cleaning of [[Industrial technology|industrial equipment]] is often carried out by clean-in-place (CIP) and/or steam-in-place (SIP) operations. CIP([[Clean-in-place|CIP]]) systems often make use of programmable controllers and [[SCADA]] software.

Washdown is the process of using a stream of water to clean a flat or nearly flat outside surface. Typically the area cleaned is a large expanse of concrete or asphalt. The area is cleaned of dirt and debris by the use of the force and dissolving power of stream of water as projected from a hose. Generally, one person holds and aims the hose, though if the hose is longer than 300 feet then another person may be required to help move the hose itself. Water is typically squirted from the hose at a pressure of 300 psi. The hose itself can vary in length from 75 to 425 feet. Though typically the hose when used by a single person is 300 feet long. The hose itself carries water from a water main which attaches to the hose through what is called a “stinger“. The stinger screws into the water main pipe and is held there.

Also, the stinger as it is pushed down into the water supply pipe opens a seal which releases the water into the hose. At the other end of the hose a nozzle regulates the flow of water and allows for a large fanned-out spray, as well as a more concentrated stream termed a needlepoint.
