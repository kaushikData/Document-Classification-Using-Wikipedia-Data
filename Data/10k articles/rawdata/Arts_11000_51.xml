===Marvel Comics===

Adam Kubert is known for his work at Marvel Comics. From 1993 to 1996 he illustrated 17 issues of writer [[Larry Hama]]'s run on ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' between issues #75 to 102. His first issue on the series featured the after affects of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] removing the [[adamantium]] from Wolverine's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 265|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= In ''Wolverine'' #75, Wolverine was left a shell of his former self, barely surviving Magneto's attack...thanks to writer Larry Hama and penciller Adam Kubert.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubert drew the ''Weapon X'' limited series as part of the "[[Age of Apocalypse]]" storyline in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he drew the ''[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught: X-Men]]'' and ''Onslaught: Marvel Universe'' one-shots which lead into the "[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]" crossover.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: "Onslaught truly rose to power in the ''Onslaught: X-Men'' special by writers Mark Waid and Scott Lobdell and artist Adam Kubert."&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 1998 he illustrated 12 issues of [[Peter David]]'s run on ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' from #454 to 467, as well as the -1 issue (July 1997). From late 1998 to early 1999 Kubert drew ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]'' #81 - 84, on which he was teamed up with European colorist [[Richard Isanove]], who subsequently followed Kubert to ''Ultimate X-Men'', employing the pencils-to-color approach seen on most of ''Ultimate X-Men'' covers.

In 2001, Kubert drew the new ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' title,&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 304: "Looking to repeat the success of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' in 2000, the second major title of this alternate universe was crafted by esteemed writer Mark Millar along with the famed Kubert brothers, Andy and Adam, taking turns at the drawing table."&lt;/ref&gt; penciling the first four issues, and then illustrating 16 various issues beginning with #7, before leaving the title with issue #33 (July 2003). In 2004, he began a run on ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'', once again with writers Mark Millar and [[Brian Michael Bendis]],&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 320: "Ultimate veterans Brian Michael Bendis, Mark Millar, and Adam Kubert reexamined Marvel's first family, creating this alternate version of the Fantastic Four."&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating that series' first six issues, and then issues 13-18.

===DC Comics===
Both Adam and his brother Andy signed exclusive contracts with DC Comics in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookbin.com/comicbooknews027.html|title= Artists Adam and Andy Kubert Sign 3-Year Exclusive Agreements With DC Comics|date= June 6, 2005|publisher= Comic Book Bin|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140111060533/http://www.comicbookbin.com/comicbooknews027.html|archivedate= January 11, 2014|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14947|title= Lying In The Gutters|first= Rich|last= Johnston|authorlink = Rich Johnston|date= June 7, 2005|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120728184934/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14947|archivedate= July 28, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|quote= The Kubert Brothers' exclusive deal with DC Comics was announced at the weekend. What was not announced was that they will be working on the ''Detective Comics'' series, with scripts written by Grant Morrison.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubert's first project for DC was illustrating "[[Last Son (comics)|Last Son]]", a [[Superman]] story arc co-written by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Richard Donner]], which ran in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #844–847, 851 and ''Action Comics Annual'' #11. Further delay forced DC Comics to bring in substitute creative teams and delay the fourth part of the "Last Son" storyline and the [[Stereoscopy|3D issue]] to #851, which was released in early July 2007. The final part of the storyline was in ''Action Comics Annual'' #11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=108943|title= More ''Action Comics'' Scheduling Woes|first= Matt|last= Brady|date= April 15, 2007|publisher= Newsarama|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121738/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=108943|archivedate= September 29, 2007|deadurl= yes|df=mdy-all|accessdate= April 3, 2008|quote= A note to let everyone know that our "Last Son" finale has been moved to ''Action Comics Annual'' #11 to accommodate Adam [Kubert]'s schedule and allow us to continue on with our ''Action Comics'' run.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his work on Superman he penciled the "[[Final Crisis]]" tie-in, ''DC Universe: Last Will and Testament'', written by [[Brad Meltzer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16693|title= Meltzer Bridges ''Final Crisis'' with ''Last Will and Testament'|first= Jeffrey|last= Renaud|date= June 4, 2008|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121006203545/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16693|archivedate= October 6, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dougall|first2=Alastair, ed.|chapter= 2000s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|location= London, United Kingdom|page= 301|isbn= 978-1465424563|quote= Geo-Force, founding member of the Outsiders, starred in this one-shot special thanks to writer Brad Meltzer and artist Adam Kubert.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last work for his latest tenure at DC was the ''Batman and The Outsiders Special,'' released in February 2009. This issue, written by [[Peter Tomasi]], highlighted [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s efforts to recruit a new team of Outsiders in the wake of [[Batman]]'s apparent death.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "2000s" in Dougall, p. 303: "In this one-shot scripted by new series writer Peter J. Tomasi and illustrated by Adam Kubert, Alfred Pennyworth assembled a new team of Outsiders."&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of the comic book, Kubert said he was pleased with his work at DC and had done, "what [he] set out to do," which was to draw Superman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/15933-adam-kubert-talks-batman-and-the-outsiders-nycc-2009.html |title=Adam Kubert Talks ''Batman and The Outsiders'' @ NYCC 2009 |year=2009 |publisher=Newsarama |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MYqN0T3X?url=http://www.newsarama.com/15933-adam-kubert-talks-batman-and-the-outsiders-nycc-2009.html |archivedate=January 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Marvel===
May 2009 marked Adam Kubert's return to Marvel, his first interior work being published as one of two stories in ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' #73 and 74.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=1001|title= Review of ''Wolverine'' #73|first= Benjamin|last= Birdie|date= May 13, 2009|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121009013119/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=1001|archivedate= October 9, 2012|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all}} Archive requires scrolldown&lt;/ref&gt; Following this he contributed several covers to ''[[New Mutants]]'' and ''Wolverine: Weapon X'', and penciled the "[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]" tie in, ''The List: Amazing [[Spider-Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://marvel.com/comics/issue/27417/dark_reign_-_the_list_amazing_spider-man_one-shot_2009_1|title= ''Dark Reign - The List: Amazing Spider-Man'' One-Shot (2009) #1|date= November 18, 2009|publisher= Marvel Comics|accessdate= April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to penciling for Marvel, he continued to do some work for DC, contributing the stories for the ''[[Wednesday Comics]]'' "[[Sgt. Rock]]" feature, drawn by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 338: "The [series] contained fifteen continuous stories, including a new Sgt. Rock saga drawn by the legendary Joe Kubert and written by his son Adam."&lt;/ref&gt; He has since stated that he is Marvel-exclusive, but they are allowed him to work on the "Sgt. Rock" feature as he had signed on to do it before his contract at DC had expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22150|title= ''Wednesday Comics'': The Kuberts|first= Jeffrey|last= Renaud|date= July 22, 2009|publisher= Comic Book Resources|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140111071217/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22150|archivedate= January 11, 2014|deadurl= no|df=mdy-all|quote= This was just an exception.

'''Amélie Beaury-Saurel''' (1849 &amp;ndash; May 30, 1924) was a French painter noted for portraiture.

==Life and career==

Born in [[Barcelona]] as Amélie Beaury, she added "Saurel" to her name in recognition of her mother's family who could trace their lineage to the Byzantine emperors of the 11th-century. Her family lived in Spain and Corsica, but eventually settled in France where she enrolled in the Academie Julian and paid for her studies by carrying out administrative duties and managing the finances.&lt;ref&gt;Madeline, L., ''Women Artists in Paris, 1850-1900,'' Yale University Press, 2017, p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

At various times, she was a pupil of [[Jules Joseph Lefebvre|J. Lefebvre]], [[T. Robert-Fleury]] and [[J.P. Laurens]] in [[Académie Julian]], and became a very popular portrait painter, thanks to [[Léon Bonnat]]. She married [[Rodolphe Julian]] in 1895 and took on charge a women's atelier. In her publications, [[Marie Bashkirtseff]] (also a Julian pupil) talked distrustfully about "l'espagnole" (''the Spanish woman''). She made her ''début'' in the ''[[Salon de Paris]]'' in 1874, where she was considered one of the most important artists of the ''Salon'' in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Yeldham, C., ''Women Artists in Nineteenth-century France and England: Their Art: Volume 1, 1984 "Fig.67 Mlle Amélie Beaury-Saurel also exhibited a self-portrait, a drawing, at the Salon of 1887, a work which received superlative praise. Like Anna Bilinska she was admired for the "virility" of her technique: "On chercherait en vain, parmi les "&lt;/ref&gt; 

Amélie Beaury-Saurel provided generously most of her mother and sister's necessities. After Julian's death, she bought and laid out "Château Julian", in [[Lapalud]], a village in [[Provence]], in memory of her husband, who had been born there. She died in [[Paris]].

==Awards and recognition==

She was awarded with a Third Medal in the ''Salon'' in 1885 and a Bronze Medal in 1889 [[World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;Women artists in nineteenth-century France and England: their art: Volume 1 Charlotte Yeldham - 1984 "Fig.67&lt;/ref&gt; Mlle Amélie Beaury-Saurel also exhibited a self-portrait, a drawing, at the Salon of 1887, a work which received superlative praise. Like Anna Bilinska she was admired for the "virility" of her technique.

'''Armintxe Cave''' in [[Lekeitio]] ([[Spain]]) is an important [[Paleolithic]] [[rock art]] site, estimated to date from between 12,000 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Location ==
Armintxe Cave is situated in the Lekeitio municipality of the [[Biscay]] province, in the [[Basque Country (greater area)|Basque Country]], northern Spain.

== Discovery ==
Although the cave was known from a long time ago, it was believed that it disappeared because of the urbanization and construction works made at the end of the [[20th century]] and beginnings of the [[21st century|21st]]. It was found again and explored on May 1, 2016, by eight [[Speleology|speleologists]] from the Basque group ADES Espeleologia Elkartea. After opening the entrance duct, located on a hillside in an urban environment, the cavers entered unknown galleries, and forced a step to a room where they found the panel of engravings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://actualid-ades.blogspot.com.es/2017/11/armintxe-archaeological-hydrogeological.html|title=Armintxe: an archaeological, hydrogeological, and diplomatic mess|last=ADES|first=|date=2017-11-13|website=actualid-ades.blogspot.com.es/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock art ==
Some of these forms and the etching technique used were announced to be "identical" to those found in the [[France|French]] [[Pyrenees]] which suggests that there could have been links between the inhabitants of both areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37654544| title = Cave art: Etchings hailed as 'Iberia's most spectacular'| date = 14 October 2016| accessdate = 14 October 2016| publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already described as a “treasure of humanity.” the depictions are among the largest found to date – some measuring up to {{convert|1.5 |m|ft|2|abbr=on}} in length. A surprise was the first Paleolithic representation of two lions in the region. In a first analysis the etchings were estimated to date from between 12,000 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/viral/362841-basque-ancient-cave-painting/ |title=‘Treasure of humanity': 14,000yo cave paintings found under Spanish town   |newspaper=RT Viral |date=  |author= |accessdate= December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main panel is beautifully and masterly carved with animal figures, displayed in a complex composition, suggesting some sort of perspective. All of them have been engraved with the same technique, scratching the soft limestone with the fingers of with a dull point, resulting in very detailed and easy to see figures. The animals are represented with high detail, typical from [[Magdalenian]] art style. Represented animals are horses, bisons, ibex and some carnivores. One of this carnivores has been undoubtly interpreted as a lion, which is an animal rarely present in Magdalenian art. Besides, several sings, including clear claviforms, have been found there. The conventions used for representing animals and the presence of claviforms suggest that the figures could be related to the Late Magdalenian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arkeobasque.wordpress.com/2016/10/14/argintxe-a-new-magdalenian-rock-art-site/|title=Armintxe, a new Magdalenian Rock-Art site|last=Rios-Garaizar|first=Joseba|date=2016-10-14|website=arkeobasque.wordpress.com/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not open to the public, 'extremely difficult to access', located under a residential building in the center of Lekeitio, the need to preserve the paintings outlines the current impossibility to access the artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3837953/50-striking-animal-images-engraved-Spanish-cave-hidden-14-000-years.html |title= 50 'striking' animal images are found engraved in a Spanish cave after being hidden for 14,000 years |newspaper=Daily Mail |date= October 14, 2016 |author=Cheyenne Macdonald, Libby Plummer For Mailonline, Afp |accessdate= December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/spectacular-14500-year-old-lion-etchings-discovered-depth-spanish-cave-1586749 |title=Spain: 'Spectacular' prehistoric lion etchings discovered in Armintxe cave |newspaper=Ibtimes co uk |date=  |author= |accessdate= December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ArmintxeDibujoA3.jpg|thumb|Map of the cave, including the location of the etchings.]]

== Conservation ==
The cave has a serious problem with floodings, due to construction and urbanization activities which have profoundly altered the course of the underground river. The episodic inundation of most of the galleries of Armintxe has already brought the deterioration of an undetermined part of the artistic heritage it encloses, and threatens to destroy the whole art ensemble. To solve the problem, it is necessary to finish the exploration in order to understand the [[Hydrogeology|hydrogeological]] behaviour of the [[karst]] as a whole; but this exploration is actually paralysed due to disagreements between Administration, archaeologists and speleologists.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Books Through Bars''' is an [[United States|American]] organization that works to provide quality reading material to prisoners in [[Pennsylvania]] and surrounding states.

''Business Entity Details''. Pennsylvania Department of State. Retrieved December 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 30 similar, but unaffiliated, organizations throughout the United States.

Because prisoners in American [[prison]]s are not able to receive books from sources other than recognized publishers, bookstores, or other legitimate distributors, those without the financial resources to buy books have very limited access to them. Prison libraries are not being funded, in part because reading material is widely seen as irrelevant to a "mostly uneducated and indeed largely illiterate prison population".&lt;ref name=Scalia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|title=Lewis v.

New Society Publishers began its program after it began receiving letters from indigent prisoners, and provides donated books to individual prisoners, prison libraries, and [[halfway house]]s.&lt;ref name=Donating&gt;{{cite web|title=Donating Books|url=http://booksthroughbars.org/donate/books/|website=Books Through Bars|accessdate=30 June 2014|quote=Dropping off books...

There are a number of '''books on British railway accidents''' which provide aid in the systematic study of the causes and effects of accidents, and their prevention.  There are common themes in many accidents (see [[Classification of railway accidents|Classification]]). Key books are listed here to avoid repeating them for each individual accident.

The [[doyen]] is [[L. T. C. Rolt]]'s ''Red for Danger'', first published in 1956, which takes a wide-ranging overview of over 100 accidents.  Most other books concentrate on a smaller number of specific accidents, described in more detail.  O.S. Nock's "Historic Railway Disasters" combines both approaches, with individual chapters on especially significant accidents such as [[Armagh rail disaster|Armagh]] and [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]].  For accidents in the last 30 years and modern operating practice, Stanley Hall's four books are particularly good.  Apart from Schneider and Mase (1968/1970) and Faith (2001), all the books below are confined to British accidents.

The list below does not include books on individual accidents; for these, see [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge]], [[Quintinshill rail crash|Quintinshill]], [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash|Harrow]], [[Hixon rail crash|Hixon]], [[Moorgate tube crash|Moorgate]] and [[Lockington rail crash|Lockington]].

An extremely valuable source now on the Internet is the Railways Archive compilation of official Railway Inspectorate Accident Reports - see "External Links" below.

[[File:Chalcography.PNG|thumb|266px|Chalcography technology, plate of German ''poeta laureatus'' Ambrosius Hannemann (died in 1644)]]

'''Chalcography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] chalcos, copper and graphia, to write), are engravings on [[copper]] plates used for printmaking and for illustrations in the production of books. The ''[[Monte dei Santi di Dio]]'' by [[Antonio Bettini]] is the most ancient book bearing chalcographies, printed in [[Florence]] on September 10, 1477 from [[Nicolo di Lorenzo Tedesco]]. Its primacy is contested by [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Cosmographia]]'', printed in [[Bologna]] on June 23, 1477 from [[Domenico de' Lapi]], a [[Latin]] translation from [[Jacopo d'Angelo]], containing geographical charts and maps by [[Taddeo Crivelli]], engraved in copper plates.

'''''Chinese Puzzle''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Casse-tête chinois'''}}) is a 2013 French [[comedy-drama]] film written and directed by [[Cédric Klapisch]]. It is the third chapter of the ''Spanish Apartment trilogy'', after ''[[L'Auberge Espagnole]]'' (2002) and ''[[Russian Dolls (film)|Les Poupées russes]] ''(''Russian Dolls'', 2005).

==Plot==

Ten years have passed, and the once happy lovers, Xavier Rousseau ([[Romain Duris]]) and Wendy ([[Kelly Reilly]]), have split. When she moves with their two children to New York City, he also moves to there to be near the children. Wendy now lives with John ([[Peter Hermann (actor)|Peter Hermann]]) in a luxury apartment overlooking Central Park. Xavier initially stays with Isabelle ([[Cécile de France]]) and Ju ([[Sandrine Holt]]), a lesbian couple whose child he fathered, but he soon finds his own apartment above a Chinese bakery where he works on a new novel assisted by brief visions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

Having no work visa, Xavier is advised by his lawyer ([[Jason Kravits]]) to seek illegal employment and marry for a green card. After saving his taxicab driver from a vicious beating, the driver's grateful Chinese-American family agrees to have Xavier marry one of their relations, Nancy ([[Li Jun Li]]), who is amenable and complicit.

His former French girlfriend, Martine ([[Audrey Tautou]]), visits him while on a business trip and returns a second time with her own two children on spring break. Xavier and Martine briefly attempt to rekindle their relationship.

The film climaxes when the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] performs a surprise inspection of Xavier's apartment while Isabelle is using it to cheat on Ju with their babysitter ([[Flore Bonaventura]]). Later as Martine is departing for home with her kids, Xavier races on foot to catch her shuttle bus, confess his love, and demand that she stay and live with him. She agrees.

The film concludes with the cast of characters walking in a celebratory parade down a Chinatown street.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2904">The '''chorus of the elderly in classical Greek drama''' is a common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theater of that period]]. Out of the thirty or so plays that are extant from the classical period, seven have choruses that consist of elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, Thomas M. ''The Poetics of Old Age in Greek Epic, Lyric and Tragedy''.Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1995.242&lt;/ref&gt; Choruses in ancient drama often provided some moralizing lesson to the protagonist, especially in tragedy. However, the figures of the elderly chorus often seem to imply a traditional way of thinking that has become outdated with time, or, in some cases, provide a model of inefficacy. As history progressed from the early stages of Greek drama (with Aeschylus) the chorus became more integrated with the happenings on stage, rendering the chorus a messenger between the world of the audience and that of the actors.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. D. F. Kitto|Kitto, H.D.F.]] ''Greek Tragedy'' London: Methuen, 1939. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tragedy ==
The chorus of the elderly within tragedy is often used as an exemplar of old social mores.  They are often ineffectual at admonishing main actors or interfering with the main plot. Sophocles in ''Oedipus at Colonus'' uses the chorus to relate to the aging protagonist, who has wandered to the town for safety. A common trope is that the elderly chorus provides sympathy and empathy for those in need as they too are in a deteriorating state, nearing their doom.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus of elders not only attempt to protect Oedipus but fail miserably; while the chorus speaks aggressively it is well known that they are too frail to attempt any sort of defense of the protagonist from physical harm. Similar outcomes of choral interference with onstage happenings occur in many other plays, including Agamemnon. Falkner notes that in tragedy the elderly are presented as [[Quixotism|quixotic]] and obsessed with the prospect of doom inherent in old age; he also notes that often the elderly are presented as mourners within plays, perhaps relating to the number of sorrows old age allows one to accrue in mind.&lt;ref&gt;Falkner, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comedy ==
Aristophanes uses the chorus of the elderly for varying reasons within his comedies. For example, the chorus of the elderly within ''The Wasps'' plays both a comedic role and also serves as a political counterfoil to the young, cosmopolitans of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Wencis, Leonard. ''The Social Significance of Youth in New Comedy'' Ann Arbor: University Microfilms, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plays  ==
*''[[The Wasps]]''
*''[[Lysistrata]]''
*''[[Oedipus Rex]]''
*''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]''
*''[[The Suppliants (Euripides)|The Suppliants]]''
*''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]''
*''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]''
*''[[Heracleidae (play)|Heracleidae]]''

'''Claire Parker''' (August 31, 1906 – October 3, 1981) was an American engineer and animator. A graduate of [[MIT]], her best-known contribution to the history of cinema is the [[Pinscreen]] (''Écran d'épingles''), a vertically-mounted grid of 240,000 sliding metal rods that are first manually pushed into position to create lit and shaded areas, then filmed frame by frame.&lt;ref name=Furniss&gt;{{cite book|last=Furniss|first=Maureen|title=Art in Motion: Animation Aesthetics|date=December 1998|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=978-1-86462-039-9|pages=54–57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQ4mrirF5nkC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;q=mindscape%20drouin|authorlink=Maureen Furniss|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the hand-operated, mechanical Pinscreen superficially shares characteristics with early "[[Precursors of film|optical toys]]" like the [[zoetrope]], it is distinguished by being one of the first devices ever to produce animation by reconfiguring a set of individual picture elements, later called [[pixel]]s. Its pin "resolution" is sufficient to create photorealistic images, a painstaking process analogous to modern [[pixel art]].

Parker shared directing credits for her films with her husband and collaborator, Russian animator [[Alexandre Alexeieff]]; however, the 1935 patent on the Pinscreen was made in her name alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvD7olaX74sC&amp;pg=PT68 French Animation History - Richard Neupert - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Alexeieff and Parker's Pinscreen films include ''Night on Bald Mountain'' (1933) and ''The Nose'' (1963), as well as the opening title sequence for [[Orson Welles]]' film ''[[The Trial (1962 film)|The Trial]]'' (1962). {{as of|2012||}}, the last known original Pinscreen still being used in animation production is maintained at the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s main campus in Montreal.&lt;ref name="VarietyJune4"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118054435?refCatId=19 | title=NFB pushes Canadian artists in edgy direction | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 4, 2012 | accessdate=June 5, 2012 | author=Blair, Iain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cutler and Gross''' is a British [[luxury good|luxury]] [[eyewear]] brand founded by [[Graham Cutler]] and [[Tony Gross]] in 1969. It is based in the [[Knightsbridge]] area of London.

==History==
The label was started in London in 1969 by partners Cutler and Gross, who had met each other in [[optometry]] school at London's [[Northampton Institute]] in the early 1960s. They opened their first optician in [[Knightsbridge]] in 1971, stocking handmade bespoke frames. Cutler and Gross are amongst a few pioneering eyewear labels to make eyewear a fashion accessory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/cutler-and-gross/ "The Fashion Model Directory on Cutler and Gross"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/designer_profile.aspx?DesignerID=948 "The British Fashion Council on Cutler and Gross"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.net-a-porter.com/Shop/Designers/Cutler_and_Gross "Net-A-Porter on Cutler and Gross"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrporter.com/Shop/Designers/Cutler_and_Gross "MrPorter on Cutler and Gross"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fashionreview.co.uk/cutler-and-gross-eyewear/ "Fashion Review on Cutler and Gross"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/london/shops/venue/2:18542/cutler-gross ''Time Out London'' on Cutler and Gross]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seen.co.uk/blog/cutler-and-gross-history/ ''Seen.co.uk'' on Cutler and Gross]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their fashion-forward{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} designs were launched in 1982 during [[Paris Fashion Week]]. Since then the wholesale collection has developed from a purely sunglasses collection to incorporate optical designs.{{Clarify|date=February 2012}} [[Marie Wilkinson]], who has worked with Mr. Cutler and Mr. Gross since 1982, is now the head of design.

==Boutiques==
As well as their flagship boutique in London's [[Knightsbridge]] district, Cutler and Gross have a 'vintage' boutique in Knightsbridge, which was named amongst "The 100 Best Shops in London"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/london/shops/venue/2:18542/cutler-gross ''Time Out London'' on Cutler and Gross]&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[Time Out London]]'', and a 'shop in shop' boutique on [[Gloucester Road, London|Gloucester Road]].

Each of these London boutiques offer a bespoke service to clients. Internationally, Cutler and Gross also have bespoke boutiques in the Soho District of New York City, West Hollywood, Toronto, the Landmark in Central, Hong Kong, and an appointment-only showroom in Iran.

===The Cutler and Gross Museum===
In August 2011, Cutler and Gross launched their museum, spanning the top floor of their Knightsbridge store. The floor has a permanent display of more than four thousand frames that date back to 1969. Also on the top floor is the bespoke service mirrored room, where the clients can create their own glasses or choose a bespoke service and have a pair designed for them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eye-wear-glasses.com/2011/08/cutler-and-gross-night-at-museum.html "Eye Wear Glasses on Cutler and Gross"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborations===
Cutler and Gross have collaborated with a range of fashion labels to create limited edition frames over the years. Recent collaborations include:

*[[Erdem Moralioğlu|Erdem]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2009/11/19/erdem-and-cutler-and-gross-collaboration "Vogue on Cutler and Gross"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Cutler and Gross collaborated with Canadian designer Erdem (2005 Fashion Fringe winner) to create a collection of sunglasses for the Spring/Summer 2010 collection. The collection was inspired by an image of a Japanese fisherwoman dressed in brightly printed shorts charging out from the waves across black sand. The glasses are a juxtaposition of vibrant colour pops with darker backgrounds on a 1960s style round frame. The sunglasses were created in black, black lace, tortoise, neutral stone and Erdem's customised Kyoto print.
*[[Maison Martin Margiela]]: In 2010 Cutler and Gross teamed up with avant-garde French fashion label Maison Martin Margiela. The collection of sunglasses featured two lines, 'Wrong Size' and 'Anatomic', both appearing in acetate and metal varieties. The 'Wrong Size' line consists of classic Cutler and Gross aviator-style frames which are deconstructed then reconstructed with ill-fitting lenses creating a unique range of sunglasses. The 'Anatomic' line consisted of large futuristic, wraparounds sunglasses that are designed wrap around the wearer in a custom fit.
*[[Giles Deacon]]: In 2010 Cutler and Gross collaborated with Giles Deacon to create a range of retro inspired 'Cats Eye' sunglasses. Mirrored lenses added a modern twist to the retro style.
*[[Comme Des Garcons]]: 2009 saw the second collaboration of Cutler and Gross with Comme Des Garcons. The 'Future of Black' limited edition collection consisted of three designs, all fitted with extra dark grey tinted lenses to create a totally black look. The glasses came inside a unique glasses case covered in Comme des Garcons's own fabric.
*[[Mulberry (company)|Mulberry]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theluxechronicles.com/the_luxe_chronicles/2008/01/mulberry-teams.html “The Luxe Chronicles on Cutler and Gross”]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Cutler and Gross collaborated with British accessories giant Mulberry. The collection showcased a small history from the archives of Cutler and Gross, dating back from the bold block colours of the early 1980s to rock &amp; roll style of the 1990s.

==History==
The Encyclopedia of Performing Arts was created by two separate projects, one dating to 1945 and the other to 1954.&lt;ref name="examenapium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examenapium.it/STUDI/Dizionari/damico.htm|title=Enciclopedia dello spettacolo, 11 voll. fondata da Silvio D'Amico  Roma: Le Maschere, 1954-1968|work=examenapium.it|language=Italian|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early version===
Starting in 1945 or 1946, D'Amico conceived of a project to develop an encyclopedia of the performing arts. Undertaken by an editorial team composed of a few people and led by D'Amico, it was produced in three or four years and contained four volumes. Considered superficial, it was not publishable. However, it developed a model for scientific study of the theater and other performing arts.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Later version===
Conceived as a set of 12 volumes, the second project took on an ethnographic approach.  It had the advantage of a stable editorial group and used foreign employees. D'Amico's editorial staff worked at the [[Palazzo Doria Pamphili]], [[Via del Plebiscito]] 112.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; The attorney [[Carlo Minù]], D'Amico's brother-in-law, found funding for the second project and referred D'Amico to publishers.&lt;ref name="unile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siba3.unile.it/ctle/damico/conversazione.htm|title=Conversazione sull'Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo con Alessandro D'Amico e Luigi Squarzina|work=unile.it|language=Italian|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In drawing up lists of [[dramas]], [[operas]], [[ballets]] and [[films]], the editorial team wondered if it their work was worthwhile or helpful.  It was [[Francesco Savio]] who sometimes said, "Of course it is; if someone else wants one day to create an Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, they would find this materials to be useful." When the news spread that the encyclopedia was about to be published, a delegation arrived wanting guidance in the organizational work to start up an encyclopedia of [[Prague]] theater.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

The structure of the work was better articulated. Responsibility for each section, such as film, music, or theater, was delegated to an initial small staff that rapidly grew to thirty editors that coordinated over five hundred employees.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt; Large blocks of work were assigned to collaborators, many of them in foreign countries.

D'Amico felt that the second project benefited from finding amateur collectors without whose assistance entire sectors of biographical entries would have been less detailed. Collected material came from abroad or was bought directly in the antique market. An example of a collector was [[Ulderico Rolandi]], a gynecologist who lived in the [[Via Veneto]], and who had made a hobby of collecting, filing and examining [[libretto]]s. He had accumulated what was thought to be the largest collection of opera librettos after the [[Library of Congress]]. Another example was [[David Turcotte]] who had developed a catalog of American cinema.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The project suffered a severe crisis in 1957, two years after the death of D'Amico, due to disagreements between the editorial office and the publisher. The publisher's expectation was to publish two volumes a year, but the editorial staff was only able to put out a single volume each year. Because of this crisis, there is an imbalance between the first volume and the last four whose detail is considered sometimes less accurate.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

===Editions===
Published between 1954 and 1962, the original nine volume ''Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo'' covers ballet, films, opera, plays, theater, [[vaudeville]], and other areas of entertainment. They include signed essays that discuss performers, directors, and writers. Other sections discuss genres and themes, as well as history, technical subjects, and bibliographies.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |title=Selected Dictionaries and Encyclopedias for Theater |publisher=Yale University Library |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621091137/http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=8564&amp;sid=66405 |archivedate=21 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia is over 18,000 pages in length and profusely illustrated with thousands of illustrations of which 700 are in the text, 1800 are out of the text, and there are 320 color plates. The first print run of 10,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 5,000 additional copies. Originally published in Rome by Casa Editrice Le Maschere, reprints were published by UNEDI.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1966, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Aggiornamento 1955-1965'' ("Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, Supplementary 1955-1965) is an update of the main set.  The Aggiornamento addresses developments and biographies.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

Published in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1968, the ''Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Indice-repertorio'' (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts. Index-Directory) is a title index of the 145,000 entries cited in the main set and the supplements.  It addresses author, genre and year of composition.&lt;ref name="Yale" /&gt;

==Personnel and management==
D'Amico conceived of the project and brought it to fruition.  The theater section was under the direction of [[Luigi Squarzina]]; he also did the film section.  D'Amico's father worked on the drama theatre section, while his brother Mario worked on the music section. [[Gabriele Baldini]] and later [[Gian Luigi Rondi]] were responsible for the cinema section. Additional sections were led by others including:  [[classical antiquity]] by [[Bruno Gentili]], German theater by [[Paolo Chiarini]], Slavic theater by [[Angelo Maria Ripellino]], English theater by Brunacci, French theater by [[Gian Carlo Roscioni]], Iberian theater by [[Luciana Stegagno Picchio]], and Italian theater by [[Niccolò Gallo]], [[Giulio Cesare Castello]], and [[Caesar Garboli]]. The [[Chamber music]] section was under the direction of D'Amico's son, [[Fedele D'Amico]], a [[Musicology|musicologist]], with [[Nino Pirrotta]], [[Franco Serpa]] and [[Emilia Zanetti]] as editors.

Consultants included [[Sabatino Moscati]] for Hebrew and [[Yiddish theater]]; [[Dario Puccini]] for the [[Iberian language]] theater; [[Luigi Salvini]] for Slavic, [[Finno-Ugric]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian language theater]]; [[Giuliano Bertuccioli]] for [[Chinese theater|Chinese language theater]]. Almost all of the drawings were made by young, recent graduates. Some of the illustrations were edited by [[Helen Poveledo]]. Texts and drafts were reviewed by professors.&lt;ref name="unile" /&gt;

==Critical and popular assessments==
Most libraries found it to be an essential component of their reference section.

The proposed biographies of many lesser figures were not included as the editorial staff were unable to keep up with the publisher's deadline.&lt;ref name="examenapium" /&gt;

Criticisms of the encyclopedia have included the fact that it was only available in the Italian language, that it was [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], and that non-European theater and 20th century theater were underrepresented. While the encyclopedia was first published in the 1950s, it was based on pre-[[World War II]] documentation. By the 1970s, the ''Encyclopedia of Performing Arts'' was considered out of date.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt;

'''Ezra Nahmad''' (born 1945) is a Syrian-born [[billionaire]] art collector and dealer. He resides in [[Monaco]], and has four children, including the British art dealer [[Helly Nahmad (London)|Helly Nahmad]].&lt;ref name=ft-article&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e9cbe436-0a15-11e1-85ca-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2cXQfIZiD |author=Jackie Wullschlager|work=[[Financial Times]]|title=Lunch with the FT: Helly Nahmad | date=| accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated that Ezra, together with his brother [[David Nahmad|David]] have built an art collection worth $3–4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2012-12-18/giuseppe-nahmad-obituary/ |work=[[Art in America]]|title=Mega-Collector and Dealer Giuseppe Nahmad Died in November|author=Sarah Cascone| date=December 18, 2012| accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ezra was born in [[Aleppo]], Syria to a [[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jewish]] family. The roots of the Nahmad family are in Aleppo, where his father, [[Sephardic Jewish]] banker Hillel Nahmad lived until just after World War II .&lt;ref name=ft-article/&gt; Following the Syrian [[anti-Jewish]] violence in 1949, his father moved to  [[Beirut]], Lebanon, where Ezra and his brothers sold English novels to US sailors stationed in Lebanon. In the early 1960s, With the rise of Palestinian threat against the [[Lebanese Republic]], Ezra's father took him and his brothers, [[Giuseppe Nahmad|Joseph (Giuseppe)]], [[David Nahmad|David]], to [[Milan]], Italy. As teenagers, the three began to deal in art - and skipped school to trade on the Italian stock market.&lt;ref name=ft-article/&gt;

==Career==
Ezra's first career milestone is believed to have taken place at a [[Juan Gris]] exhibition in [[Rome]], organized by cubist dealer [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]. Ezra and his brother bought two works – the only pieces sold. Kahnweiler befriended them, selling them works by [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], and Gris. With the emergence of the [[Red Brigades]] terror group in the 1970s, Milan was perceived as too dangerous, and the family moved again. Ezra and his brother Joseph headed for Monaco, and David to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.artlyst.com/articles/gallerist-helly-nahmad-arrested-for-suspected-gambling-related-money-laundering |work=|title= Gallerist Helly Nahmad Arrested For Suspected Gambling Related Money Laundering| date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, Ezra and his brother David are considered influential "mega-dealers" of modern and impressionist art by the most well-known names, from [[Monet]] and [[Matisse]] to [[Renoir]] and [[Rothko]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} They own an inventory of between 4,000 and 4,500 works, stored in the duty-free [[Geneva Freeport]] warehouse next to the airport in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The brothers buy and sell most of their works at auction.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Personal life==
His son [[Helly Nahmad (London)|Helly Nahmad]] is a London-based art dealer. In 2007, his daughter Michaela Nahmad was "thought to be embarking on a career as an art dealer".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/3670009/Market-news-graffiti-art.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30316">'''Fictional portrayals of psychopaths''', or '''sociopaths''', are some of the most notorious in film and literature but may only vaguely or partly relate to the concept of [[psychopathy]], which is itself used with varying definitions by [[mental health professional]]s, [[criminologist]]s and others. The character may be identified as a diagnosed/assessed psychopath or sociopath within the fictional work itself, or by its creator when discussing their intentions with the work, which might be distinguished from opinions of audiences or [[critic]]s based only on a character appearing to show traits or behaviors associated with an undefined popular stereotype of psychopathy.

Such characters are often portrayed in an [[exaggeration|exaggerated]] fashion and typically in the role of a [[villain]] or [[antihero]], where the general characteristics of a psychopath are useful to facilitate conflict and danger. Because the definitions and criteria in the [[history of psychopathy]] have varied over the years and continue to change even now, many characters in notable films may have been designed to fall under the category of a psychopath at the time of the film's production or release, but not necessarily in subsequent years. There are several [[stereotypical]] images of psychopathy in both [[Layperson|lay]] and professional accounts which only partly overlap and can involve contradictory traits: the charming [[con artist]], the deranged [[serial killer]], the successful [[Psychopathy in the workplace|corporate psychopath]], or the chronic low-level [[crime|offender]] with [[juvenile delinquency]]. The public concept reflects some combination of fear of the mythical [[bogeyman]], fascination with human [[evil]], and sometimes perhaps [[envy]] of people who might appear to go through life unencumbered by the same levels of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anguish]] or [[Emotional security|insecurity]].&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skeem|first=J. L.|author2=Polaschek, D. L. L.|author3=Patrick, C. J.|author4=Lilienfeld, S. O.|title=Psychopathic Personality: Bridging the Gap Between Scientific Evidence and Public Policy|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|date=15 December 2011|volume=12|issue=3|pages=95–162|doi=10.1177/1529100611426706|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/journals/pspi/psychopathy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early depictions==
In the 19th century the diagnostic categories of [[monomania]] or [[moral insanity]] (the word 'moral' then meant either emotional or ethical) made their way into works of literature, covering numerous eccentricities, obsessions or breakdowns—and sometimes acts of apparently senseless criminality, occasionally violent. This period also saw the rise of [[crime fiction]] such as [[sensation novels]], where often someone in a local community who appeared normal would turn out to be criminally insane, and [[detective novels]], playing on increasing anxieties about the characters of people in the newly expanding and diversifying industrial cities.&lt;ref name=Thesing&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to the Victorian novel |author=Patrick Brantlinger, William B. Thesing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMWWh6yu3oEC |page=76 &amp; 236|isbn= 0-631-22064-X |year=2002 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'psychopath' came into use in the late 19th century (as did the term it would often be confused with, [[psychotic]]), and also spanned a very wide range of conditions ([[etymologically]] and originally equivalent to 'mentally ill'). Nevertheless, an early rise to prominence followed its use in a Russian trial between 1883 and 1885 concerning a child murder, contributing to the release of a probable false confessor while the original suspect was found guilty. 'Psychopaths' began to appear in [[vaudeville]]s, ditties (songs) and press articles. The psychopathy defense was reported internationally as having enabled a remorseless female child killer to go free, a usage still quoted in dictionaries today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 2011: Psychopath: 1885 Pall Mall G. 21 Jan. Article archive text via [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50E17F7345F15738DDDAD0994DA405B8584F0D3 MLLE. SEMENOVA'S ACQUITTAL] 1885 NY Times from Pall Mall Gazette. [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psychopath&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary: Psychopath] cites instead a reference to the british Daily Telegraph's coverage of the case.

[[Degeneration|'Degenerates']] were also depicted in popular fiction of the 19th through to mid 20th century, sometimes in similar ways to the modern usages of the concept of psychopaths, sometimes being cited as a cause of psychopathy. The concept fell into disrepute due partly to its use by the Nazis to justify eradicating their opposition.&lt;ref name=Jalava&gt;[http://summit.sfu.ca/item/8120 Science of conscience: Metaphysics, morality, and rhetoric in psychopathy research] Jarkko Jalava, 2007, PhD at Simon Fraser University, then Professor at Okanagan College, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==
The meaning gradually narrowed, initially as 'psychopathic inferiors' covering all of what today might be called [[personality disorders]] and various other conditions, then intertwining with the terminology of the 'sociopath' (and eventually [[antisocial personality disorder]]), though psychopathy remained variously defined in both broad and narrow ways.

Early representations of psychopaths in film were often caricatured as sadistic, unpredictable, sexually depraved, and emotionally unstable ([[mania|manic]]) characters with a compulsion to engage in random violence and destruction, usually with a series of bizarre mannerisms such as giggling, laughing, or facial [[tics]]. Up until the late 1950s, cinematic conventions usually relegated the psychopath to roles of genre villains such as gangsters, [[mad scientists]], [[supervillains]], and many types of generic criminals. Examples of this type are [[Pinkie Brown]] ([[Richard Attenborough]]) in ''[[Brighton Rock (1947 film)|Brighton Rock]]'', Tommy Udo ([[Richard Widmark]]) in ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'', Cody Jarrett ([[James Cagney]]) in ''[[White Heat (film)|White Heat]]'', and [[Tony Camonte|Antonio 'Tony' Camonte]] ([[Paul Muni]]) in the 1932 version of ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]''. [[Homosexuals]] were also referred to as psychopaths under the broad definition then in use; the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in the first [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in 1952 would list it under 'sociopathic personality disturbance'.

One exceptional depiction in this period was the character of child murderer Hans Beckert ([[Peter Lorre]]) in the 1931 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''. Lorre portrays Beckert as an outwardly unremarkable man tormented by a compulsion to ritualistically murder children. A German film (allegedly based on the real life [[serial killer]] [[Peter Kürten]]), it was released in America in 1933 and has been seen as indicative of a turning point in American media depictions of psychopaths. Until the 1930s psychiatrists typically applied the diagnosis to unemployed males or 'hypersexual' women, but several psychiatric, cultural and economic trends, together with [[sex crime]] panics, converged to transform the popular psychopath into a violent, male, sexual deviant or criminal—a threat to innocence, [[gender role]]s and the [[social order]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1908506?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102561687811 "Uncontrolled Desires": The Response to the Sexual Psychopath, 1920-1960] Estelle B. Freedman, The Journal of American History, Vol. 74, No. 1 (Jun., 1987), pp. 83-106. Also reproduced in [https://books.google.com/books?id=5jTjfFo42E8C Passion and Power: Sexuality in History (from Pg 199)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ostap Bender]] character from novels [[The Twelve Chairs]] and [[The Little Golden Calf]] by Soviet authors [[Ilf and Petrov]] is also considered a portrait of a charming psychopath.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.b17.ru/blog/11662/ Be cautious - socially adapted psychopath, damned attractive man]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tanja-tank.livejournal.com/34480.html sociopaths and narcissists in movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennie Small from [[Of Mice and Men]], who is mentally retarded, has been described as also lacking a conscience or moral sense, a common definition of a [[psychopath]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/o/of-mice-and-men/character-analysis/lennie-small&lt;/ref&gt; His inability to stay out of trouble is often attributed to this.

==Mid 20th century==
One of the earliest real life cases which had a pervasive influence on American movies was that of [[Ed Gein]], arrested in 1957. A farmer who had resided with his mother until her death, he had then killed two women and dug up female bodies from the local [[cemetery]], making various items out of their skin. Rumours spread that he was also a [[necrophiliac]], [[cannibal]] or [[transvestite]], though these appear to have been unsupported other than by brief affirmations from Gein to [[leading questions]] by interrogators.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_ZDUR7H_QMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Deviant] Harold Schechter, 1998, Pg 192, 238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robertcdaniels.com/ed_gein.htm#_ftn2 Ed Gein: the Cannibal Myth Exposed]&lt;/ref&gt; Gein was found mentally ill and legally insane before trial, deemed to have had [[schizophrenia]] (psychosis including [[delusions]] and [[hallucinations]]) for at least 12 years, though at least one media psychiatrist dubbed him instead a 'sexual psychopath'.&lt;ref&gt;Gonyea, Floyd.

January 7, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bloch]], a prolific pulp horror author, says his 1959 novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' was based on the Gein murders and the idea of an apparently sane person in a local community committing heinous crimes, but not necessarily on Gein himself, despite numerous similarities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediageeknetwork.com/psycho-exclusive-an-interview-with-author-robert-bloch/ PSYCHO EXCLUSIVE: An Interview With Author Robert Bloch] By Ed Gross, Media Geek Network, November 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The villain, [[Norman Bates]], is portrayed as an outwardly unremarkable man who murders a woman while under the control of an [[disassociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] that takes the form of [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his domineering mother]], who he himself murdered. Both the novel and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film adaptation]] were influences on the popular media portrayal of psychopaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penguin-readers.com/pdf/downloads/pr/teachers-notes/9781405879286.pdf Teacher's Notes: Psycho] Penguin 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;[http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC43folder/EdGein.html Ed Gein and the figure of the transgendered serial killer] by K.E. Sullivan. from Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media, no. 43, July 2000, pp. 38-47&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the book nor film elaborates on the term 'psycho', though it is commonly taken to refer to either psychotic or psychopath. At the end of the film, a psychiatrist describes Bates as having a split personality. [[Multiple personality disorder]] was at that time very popular (cf 1957 movie ''[[The Three Faces of Eve]]'') and is to this day commonly confused with [[schizophrenia]]. Bloch later wrote a script for the 1966 film ''[[The Psychopath]]'', the original working title for which was "Schizo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britmovie.co.uk/films/The-Psychopath_1966 The Psychopath – 1966: Plot Synopsis]&lt;/ref&gt;

A different thread within fictional portrayals of psychopathy continued to focus on rebelliously antisocial characters. The title of the 1955 film ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', starring [[James Dean]], came from a 1944 book of the same name detailing the [[hypnosis|hypno]]-[[Psychoanalysis|analysis]] of a diagnosed psychopath. In the book, psychiatrist [[Robert M. Lindner]] also discussed psychopaths in general as pointlessly selfish individuals who appear unable to accept society's rules. In [[Ken Kesey]]'s 1962 novel ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', [[Randle McMurphy]], after being admitted to a mental institution, is repeatedly referred to by the authorities, other patients and himself as a possible or definite psychopath. He reads from his record: "repeated outbreaks of passion that suggest the possible diagnosis of psychopath", and adds that a doctor told him it means "I fight and fuh-pardon me, ladies-means I am he put it overzealous in my sexual relations." The current doctor then reads out the note: "Don't overlook the possibility that this man might be feigning psychosis".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/one-flew-over-cuckoos-nest/madness-quotes.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the script for the popular [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|film adaptation]] in 1975, only the latter is retained and the term psychopath is never used. Ironically, the main authority figure in the hospital—the cold, [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] [[Nurse Ratched]]—was later described as a psychopath under later understandings of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LBIjsk-2ok4C The Psychopath in Film] 1999 By Wayne Wilson. Pg 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20th century==
The 1973 film ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' involved two lead characters based loosely on  [[Charles Starkweather]] and [[Caril Ann Fugate]]. While the male lead Kit ([[Martin Sheen]]) is sometimes described as a psychopath or sociopath, psychologist [[Robert D. Hare]], a leading proponent of the assessment of psychopathy, has identified Holly ([[Sissy Spacek]]) as exemplifying his concept of a psychopath due to her poor emotional sense of the meaning of events and her attempted mask of normality. However, writer and director [[Terrence Malick]] has said he considered Kit's shallow, bitter insensitivity to be a result of suffering and neglect growing up in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], and 15-year-old Holly, though immature and mis-estimating her audience, to be a quite typical [[Southern United States|Southern]] girl wanting to help narrate and come off well but still give the hard facts, and not dwell on herself or on personal tragedies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xfIEVtzj52YC Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us] Robert D.

The increasing media focus of serial killers in the late 20th century, fueled by cases such as [[John Wayne Gacy]] (1978), [[Ted Bundy]] (1978) and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] (1991), lent an additional momentum to the way psychopathy was both perceived and portrayed in film and literature, sometimes incorporating a hybrid of traditional psychopaths from early film and late-19th century literature with the high-functioning behaviors detected in some serial killers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc3228/m2/1/high_res_d/thesis.pdf Serial Killing Myths Versus Reality: A Content Analysis of Serial Killer Movies Made Between 1980 and 2001] Sarah Scott McCready, Masters Thesis, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1995.1801_87.x | volume=18 | issue=1 | title=Consuming Cannibals: Psychopathic Killers as Archetypes and Cultural Icons | year=1995 | journal=The Journal of American Culture | pages=87–96 | last1 = Grixti | first1 = Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychiatrist and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] serial killer [[Dr. Hannibal Lecter]], most notably portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]] in the [[Academy Award]]-winning 1991 film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', is perhaps the most infamous fictional psychopath of the 20th century. Lecter is intelligent and sophisticated (whereas psychopathy is generally associated with lower than average verbal [[intelligence]]&lt;ref name="LecterIntelligence"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeLisi|first=Matt|author2=Vaughn, Michael G.|author3=Beaver, Kevin M.|author4=Wright, John Paul|title=The Hannibal Lecter Myth: Psychopathy and Verbal Intelligence in the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=32|issue=2|pages=169–177|doi=10.1007/s10862-009-9147-z|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/staff/delisi/Hannibal%20Lecter%20PDF.pdf|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and his disarming charisma and wit disguise his true nature as a serial killer. He spends most of the film in a cell, taunting [[Clarice Starling]] with clues to the identity of another serial killer, [[Buffalo Bill (The Silence of the Lambs)|Buffalo Bill]], in exchange for intimate details of Starling's troubled childhood. Lecter first appeared in [[Thomas Harris]]'  1981 novel ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'', in which he is characterized as not fitting any known psychological profile. In the film adaptation of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', he is referred to as a "pure psychopath".&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' and its first film adaptation, ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'', FBI profiler [[Will Graham (fictional character)|Will Graham]] suggests that psychologists "say he's a sociopath" because they "don't know what else to call him". Shortly afterwards in ''Red Dragon'', Lecter's jailer [[Frederick Chilton]] says "...we thought he might provide us with a singular opportunity to study a pure sociopath...As it turned out, I don't think we're any closer to understanding him now than the day he came in." In the script for the film version of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', the same character calls Lecter a "pure psychopath". In the novel of the same name, FBI agent [[Jack Crawford (character)|Jack Crawford]] tells Starling "I'm waist-deep in inaccessible patient evaluations of Dr. Lecter and they're all different" and Chilton later tells Starling "A pure sociopath, that's obviously what he is. But he's impenetrable, much too sophisticated for the standard tests."&lt;/ref&gt; In the later novels ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]'' and ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'', Lecter's psychopathy is portrayed as the result of seeing his sister Mischa murdered and cannibalized during [[World War II]]. In 2013 Harris revealed that he originally based the Lecter character on Alfredo Ballí Trevino, a Mexican physician who had killed and dismembered his [[homosexual]] lover, in what was called a [[crime of passion]] over a financial dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/495908/20130731/hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-ball.htm Real Hannibal Lecter was Murderous Gay Mexican Doctor Alfredo Ballí Treviño] Umberto Bacchi, IB Times, July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latintimes.com/articles/6867/20130730/real-hannibal-lecter-gay-mexican-doctor-alfredo-balli-trevino-inspiration-thomas-harris-silence-lambs-25-anniversary.htm Who Was The Real Hannibal Lecter?] Valdez, Latin Times, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[American Psycho]]'' tells the story of [[Patrick Bateman]], a [[yuppie]] serial killer working on [[Wall Street]] in the 1980s. It was made into a [[American Psycho (film)|film]] in 2000. Author [[Bret Easton Ellis]] has told interviewers that the book is a satire on shallow [[consumerist]] lifestyles, but also that the writing of the violent scenes was based on fictional horror and FBI material on serial killers, along with how he imagined "a psychotic who worked on Wall Street" would describe such incidents. Some commentary, including in scientific journals, has suggested the Bateman character appears to be a psychopath. However, Bateman also exhibits signs of psychosis such as hallucinations, and as such appears to be an [[unreliable narrator]]; it is left ambiguous whether Bateman is actually a serial killer, or is merely hallucinating about committing murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6127/the-art-of-fiction-no-216-bret-easton-ellis Bret Easton Ellis, The Art of Fiction]  No. 216.

In the 1993 book ''[[Girl, Interrupted]]'' and its 1999 [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film adaptation]], the character of Lisa (played by [[Angelina Jolie]] in the film) is a rebellious, antisocial young woman who is diagnosed as a sociopath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.cengage.com/psychology/resources/students/screen/screen_20000110.html Girl, Interrupted—Cuckoo's Nest Redux] By Elaine Cassel, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is left ambiguous whether that diagnosis is accurate.

The 1996 film ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' depicts a suspected murderer who appears to suffer from [[multiple personality disorder]], who at the end reveals that he has been faking the disorder. In the original novel by [[William Diehl]], the psychiatrist Molly Arrington and others repeatedly explain psychopathy and psychosis as if they are the same, inherently antisocial, condition.

''[[Harry Potter]]'' author [[J. K. Rowling]] has described [[Lord Voldemort]], the series' main villain, as "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering, and there ARE people like that in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0900-ew-jensen.htm|author=Jensen, Jeff. |title='Fire' Storm |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=7 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Numerous characters in television shows are informally described as psychopaths by the [[actors]] who play the parts. Examples include [[Natalie Buxton]] in ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.badgirls.co.uk/library/int-s6-db.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Slater]] and [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] in ''[[EastEnders]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bettingpress.com/category/Entertainment/Who-killed-Archie-Mitchell-update--Sean-Slater-now-favourite-in-Eastenders-betting-201002160062/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a373916/eastenders-michael-moon-is-a-psychopath-says-steve-john-shepherd.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dexter Morgan]] in the American show ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://darklydexter.com/articles/michael-c-hall-and-kevin-dutton-discuss-about-psychopathy/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/features/jodie-comer-meet-killing-eves-pink-dressed-psychopathic-breakout-star-w520872&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] from the British TV soap ''[[Coronation Street]]'', is also known for having a serious personality disorder. His character is famous for presenting several tendencies of a sociopathic personality including, manipulation, lying, and aggression. He has served time in prison and often blames his mother for his traumatic childhood,  His character has matured over the years however, the mask tends to slip from time to time and he returns to his darker side, most recently when he helped hide a dead body with a terrifying, cold-hearted attitude.

[[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]], the title character in the FOX medical-thriller ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' is referred to as a sociopath multiple times by several characters throughout the course of the show.

[[Sherlock Holmes]], the lead character in the BBC series ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', is referred to as a psychopath multiple times throughout the course of the show; in response to these claims, Holmes describes himself as a "high-functioning sociopath". He has also been described as having [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/magazine/06diagnosis-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetclaire.org/quotes/sherlock/series-two/the-hounds-of-baskerville/ |title=Sherlock "The Hounds of Baskerville" (Episode 2.2) &amp;#124; Planet Claire Quotes |publisher=Planetclaire.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dan Wells (author)|Dan Wells]] novel ''[[I Am Not a Serial Killer]]'' and its sequels, ''[[Mr. Monster]]'' and ''[[I Don't Want To Kill You]]'', are narrated by John Wayne Cleaver, a teenaged diagnosed sociopath who lives by a rigid code of behavior in order to avoid becoming a serial killer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fearfulsymmetry.net/ Author's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

One Chicago academic has argued in a review of TV trends that the contemporary fantasy of sociopathy/psychopathy is of someone whose emotional disconnection from others in society, rather than being the hindrance that it can represent in real clinical cases, enables them to be an amazingly successful manipulator due to a breakdown in the [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenewinquiry.com/features/why-we-love-sociopaths/ Why We Love Sociopaths]. Adam Kotsko, New Inquiry, April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary advice on writing psychopathic/sociopathic characters suggests that lack of a conscience and lack of empathy are always the chief characteristics, along with an ability to fool others, while the type of selfish antisocial behavior, and any secondary characteristics, can vary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5fPEQl7I5H0C&amp; Bullies, Bastards And Bitches: How To Write The Bad Guys Of Fiction].

In 2013, the video console game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was released with numerous references to psychopaths and sociopaths, including reports from a fictional psychiatrist. One of the lead characters, Trevor, is described both psychopathic and psychotic; the voice actor who played the part says he based his performance on [[Tom Hardy]]'s portrayal of [[Charles Bronson (prisoner)|Charles Bronson]] in the film ''[[Bronson (film)|Bronson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/an-interview-with-steven-ogg-the-voice-of-gta-vs-trevor An Interview With Steven Ogg, The Voice Of "GTA V’s" Trevor].

[[File:FrenchOperaByNight.jpg|right|thumb|Postcard view from late in the building's history]]
The '''French Opera House''', or ''Théâtre de l'Opéra'', was an [[opera house]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. It was one of the city's landmarks from its opening in 1859 until it was destroyed by fire in 1919. It stood in the [[French Quarter]] at the uptown lake corner of [[Bourbon Street|Bourbon]] and Toulouse Streets, with the main entrance on Bourbon.

==History==
Designed by [[James Gallier, Jr.]], the hall was commissioned by [[Charles Boudousquié]], then the director of the opera company, which had previously made its home in the [[Théâtre d'Orléans]]. After a dispute with new owners of the Orléans, Boudousquié determined to build a grand new house for French opera. The building went up in less than a year at a cost of $118,500 and for the next sixty years, it was the center of social activity in New Orleans. Not only [[opera]] was held there, but also Carnival balls, debuts, benefits, receptions, and concerts. On May 23, 1859, the ''New Orleans Delta'' gave a description of the new theater: 
:The building of the opera house at the corner of Bourbon and Toulouse streets is going ahead briskly.  The foundations have been laid, and the front walls have almost reached a height of one story.  The great area of the theater attracts the attention of everybody; and as all our opera-going population feel more or less interest in it, we think some account of the shape, plan, and style of the building, will be acceptable. 
:It will be a handsome structure of the Italian order of architecture, with a front of one hundred and sixty-six feet on Bourbon street, one hundred and eighty-seven on Toulouse street, and a height of about eighty feet in its highest part. The edifice will rise like a colossus over everything in that vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Curtis 1929, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 25, 1862, New Orleans had been captured by Union forces in the [[US Civil War]] and the French Opera ceased to present performances until the end of the war.  However, in 1864, the wife of Union General Nathaniel P. Banks held a ball at the theater in honor of [[George Washington]]'s birthday.  At the end of the War, the French Opera House was reopened and continued to present many American operatic premieres.

By 1913, however, the house had fallen on hard times and was forced into receivership. An anonymous donor (later identified as William Ratcliffe Irby) purchased the building and donated it to [[Tulane University]], along with the wherewithal to operate it under the new leadership of the French tenor [[Agustarello Affré]]. The building reopened, but went up in flames on the night of December 4, 1919. The last performance was [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]'', a long favorite amongst old family Creoles. [WPA Photograph Collection]

The French Opera House itself was the most fashionable establishment in New Orleans in the years between the Civil War and World War I. The first night of the opera season was the opening of the social season in New Orleans, and it is an important feature of New Orleans social life, attendance being a social event of importance in accordance with its rituals and traditions. The French Opera season became the center of social life for New Orleans' elite, with the oldest and most prominent families owning seats in the theater's boxes or "Loges Grilles".

'''Gentle Monster''' styled as GENTLE MONSTER ([[Hangeul]]: 젠틀몬스터)  is a Korean  [[sunglasses]] and optical glasses [[brand]] founded by Hankook Kim in [[Seoul]], South Korea in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/designers/gentle-monster Gentle Monster] [[SSENSE]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STORE LANDS" /&gt; 
As of April 2018, the company has 41 directly operated stores worldwide, including in Korea, the United States, Singapore, and China. 

==Retail spaces==

For example, in May through August 2016 its [[New York City]] flagship store was turned into an underwater experience  creates with [[aquarium]] designer Justin Muir and [[glass]] sculptor Ivan Lee Mora,  influenced by the French film ''Le Grand Bleu''.&lt;ref name="grand bleu"&gt;[https://hypebeast.com/2016/5/gentle-monster-grand-blue-installation Gentle Monster Transforms Its New York City Store Into an Underwater Oasis] Helena Yeung, ''[[Hypebeast]]'', May 26, 2016 &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Serial entrepreneur]] Jae W Oh invested about $100,000 in 2012 and Gentle Monster began producing frames in [[Daegu]], which had been a manufacturing hub for [[Luxottica]],  and China, since [[acetate]] frames are illegal to produce in [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="LAUREN SHERMAN"&gt;[https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/how-gentle-monster-road-the-k-pop-wave-to-160-million How Gentle Monster Rode the K-Pop Wave to $160 Million] LAUREN SHERMAN, ''Business of Fashion'', JULY 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The brand's designs favor oversize frames much larger than Western brands' because its Asian clientele prefer to have frames that create an image of a smaller face.&lt;ref name="LAUREN SHERMAN" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fashionista.com/2016/04/gentle-monster MEET GENTLE MONSTER, A KOREAN BRAND CREATING EYEWEAR FOR EVERY FACE SHAPE]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19976">[[File:Lemmy-02.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Lemmy Kilmister]], the lead singer and bassist of [[Motörhead]], performing in 2005.]]
'''Heavy metal bass''' is the use of the [[bass guitar]] (also called "electric bass") in the [[rock music]] genres of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hard rock]]. The bassist is part of the [[rhythm section]] in a heavy metal band, along with the [[Drum kit|drummer]], [[rhythm guitar]]ist and, in some bands, a [[Keyboard (music)|keyboard player]]. The prominent role of the bass is key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] is a central element of metal. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music "heavy".&lt;ref name=W24&gt;Weinstein (2000), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; The bass plays a "... more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock."&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein (2009), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal bassists play many different types of [[bassline]]s, depending on the subgenre they are playing in and their personal playing style. Metal bass lines vary in complexity, from holding down a low [[pedal point]] as a foundation for the band's sound to doubling complex [[riff]]s and [[lick (music)|licks]] along with the [[lead guitar]] and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's [[Cliff Burton]] with his emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bassplayer.com/article/the-king-metal/Feb-05/164 "Cliff Burton's Legendary Career: The King of Metal Bass"]. ''Bass Player'', February 2005. Retrieved on November 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, such as [[Lemmy Kilmister]] of [[Motörhead]] and [[Tom Araya]] of [[Slayer]]. Some metal bassists sing [[backup vocals]] while they play bass.

==Roles and playing styles==
[[File:Priest feast 36 - Ian Hill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bass guitarist [[Ian Hill]] from the heavy metal band [[Judas Priest]]. A red [[Plectrum|pick]] can be seen in his plucking hand.]]
Most metal bassists play by plucking the strings with their fingers or by [[guitar pick|picking]] with a [[plectrum]], often known as a pick. Using a pick enables bassists to play rapid repeated notes and fast basslines. While the types of [[bass line]]s vary in different metal subgenres, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the [[chord progression|harmonic framework]] with bass notes that emphasize the roots of the chords and, along with the [[drum kit|drums]] and [[rhythm guitar]], establishing the beat. The bass is also used a solo instrument in some metal styles. While four-string basses (tuned E, A, D, G from lowest string to highest string) are the most common, since the 1990s, some metal bassists have used five-string basses for added lower range—a low "B". Five string basses are used in [[nu metal]], to complement the [[downtuned guitar]]s use by the rhythm guitarists. Most metal bassists play with fretted instruments, which have metal frets on the fingerboard. However, there are a few bassists such as [[Steve DiGiorgio]] who use [[fretless bass]]es.

Most of the time, metal bass players play basslines which consist of a single note played at a time; that is, without playing multiple notes at the same time to form [[Guitar chord|chord]]s, the way a [[rhythm guitar]]ist would on an [[electric guitar]]. There are, however, a few metal bassists who play chords. [[Robert Trujillo]] of [[Metallica]] is known for playing "massive chords" &lt;ref&gt;Warwick Robert Trujillo Signature Bass. February 19, 2012 in basses, Featured by G.M. Jameson. "Robert Trujillo Demands Something Solid" Available at: www.rottenbass.com/warwick-robert-trujillo-signature-bass-57 Accessed on June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and "chord-based harmonics" &lt;ref&gt;Metallica Bassist Robert Trujillo Funding Jaco Pastorius Biopic
Posted 06/04/2012 by Damian Fanelli Available online at: www.guitarworld.com/metallica-bassist-robert-trujillo-funding-jaco-pastorius-biopic Accessed on June 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on the bass. [[Lemmy]] of [[Motörhead]] often played [[power chord]]s in his bass lines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorhead.ru/int2moo.htm|title=We Do Not Bend The Knee. Motorhead Interview|publisher=|accessdate=29 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66kjEY0ay?url=http://www.motorhead.ru/int2moo.htm|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;No, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Soloing===
While bass guitar solos are much less common in metal than [[guitar solo]]s for electric guitar, some metal bassists do play solos. Bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. Bass solos are performed using a range of different techniques, such as plucking or fingerpicking. A small number of metal bassists do two-handed [[tapping]] styles in which they use both hands to play notes on the fretboard by rapidly pressing and holding the string to the fret. Players noted for this soloing technique include [[Cliff Burton]] and [[shred guitar]]-style bassist [[Billy Sheehan]]. [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Good Times Bad Times]]", the first song on their [[Led Zeppelin (album)|first album]], contains two brief bass solos, occurring after the song's first and third choruses. [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s bassist, [[John Deacon]], occasionally played bass solos, such as on the song "[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]". [[Metallica]]'s 1983 debut ''[[Kill Em All]]'' includes the song "[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]," consisting entirely of a bass solo played by [[Cliff Burton]]. [[Manowar]]'s bassist [[Joey DeMaio]] uses special [[piccolo bass]] for his extremely fast bass solos like "Sting of the Bumblebee" and "William's Tale".

Heavy metal bass players such as [[Geezer Butler]] ([[Black Sabbath]]), [[Alex Webster]] ([[Cannibal Corpse]]), Cliff Burton (Metallica), and [[Les Claypool]] ([[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Blind Illusion]]) have used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. In both published [[Van Halen]] concert videos, [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]] performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. When playing bass solos, rock and metal bassists sometimes use [[Effects unit|effects]] such as [[fuzz bass]] or a  [[wah-wah pedal]] to produce a more pronounced sound. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both effects. Due to the lower range of the bass, bass guitar solos usually have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments. In some cases, the bass guitar solo is unaccompanied, or accompanied only by the drums.

===Training===
[[File:Steve Harris 521.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] from [[Iron Maiden]] performing in 2008.]]
There is much less formal training available in college and university for metal bass, the way there is for bass guitarists learning [[jazz]] and the mainstream commercial genres (rock, [[R&amp;B]], etc.). Many metal bass players learn by ear, by copying bass lines from records and CDs, and by playing in a number of bands, which may include [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s. Metal bassists may be able to take lessons from expert metal players or teachers. They may also be able to adapt techniques from other genres to the metal genre. As well, there are a range of books, playing methods, and, since the 1990s and 2000s, instructional DVDs and YouTube videos on how to play metal bass.

===Roles===
Metal bassists play in groups ranging in size from the [[power trio]] (guitar, bass and drums, with one or more of the members singing) to larger bands with multiple guitarists, keyboards, a bassist, a drummer and a vocalist. Some metal bassists sing lead vocals while they play bass, a role that [[Lemmy Kilminster]] of [[Motörhead]] did, and which [[Tom Araya]] of [[Slayer]] and [[Grutle Kjellson]] of [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]] continue to do. Some metal bassists sing [[backup vocals]] while they play bass. Some metal bassists are also [[bandleader]]s or [[songwriter]]s for their bands examples being [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] and [[Nikki Sixx]]. In a few cases, traditional metal group bass players have also played another instrument, such as [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who played [[Hammond organ]] on some songs or the bassists from mainstream metal bands such as [[Styx (band)|Styx]] and the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] who use a [[pedal keyboard]], which is played with the feet.

Professional metal bassists may have a [[guitar technician#bass guitar technician|bass technician]] who tunes their basses before and during a performance, sets up the speaker cabinets, amplifiers and effects units, and performs routine maintenance on the instruments and equipment (e.g., changing strings, replacing speakers, replacing amplifier [[Vacuum tube|tubes]], etc.).

Almost all of the most well-known metal bassists are male.

Women have less roles in rock music genres like metal because the "... rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion." Philip Auslander says that "Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music". Though some women played instruments in American [[all-female bands|all-female garage rock bands]], none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they "did not provide viable templates for women's on-going participation in rock".&lt;ref name="I Wanna Be Your Man"&gt;

==Equipment==

===Basses===
Some metal bassists use unusually-shaped instruments, such as [[Gene Simmons]] from [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], who had an instrument custom made in the shape of an axe, or those who use instruments like [[ES Guitars]]' Avenger, which has a jagged design. Many metal bassists use electric basses that are used in other rock genres, such as the [[Fender Precision]] bass.

===Amplifiers and effects===
Heavy metal bassists use many different brands of [[Bass instrument amplification|bass amplifiers]] and [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]]s to make the instrument sound loud enough on stage. Bass players also use their amplifier's preamp, gain, overdrive (if present) and tone controls to create their unique personal bass sound. In some genres of music, such as folk and small combo jazz, the other instruments are often acoustic and so bass players in these styles may not need large, powerful bass amps. However, in heavy metal live performances, [[loudness]]—an "onslaught of sound," in sociologist [[Deena Weinstein]]'s description—is considered vital.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The need for a loud volume in metal bands is even more paramount in large performance venues, such as stadiums. To get a loud enough bass sound to compete with the loudly amplified electric guitars and the large drum kits used in metal, metal bassists typically use large bass speaker cabinets stacked on top of each other–"bass stacks"–powered by high-wattage amplifiers. Traditional heavy metal bands were early users of "bass stacks". Bassist [[Alex Webster]] from the death metal band [[Cannibal Corpse]] plays with two 8x10 speaker cabinets (each cabinet contains eight 10" speakers).

One early bass stack was the 300-watt [[Ampeg SVT|Super Vacuum Tube (SVT)]] amplifier head, which was intended for large performance venues. The SVT was intended for use with one or two speaker cabinets containing eight 10" speakers. Some metal bassists use [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers, which were the dominant active electronic components in bass amplifiers manufactured until the early 1970s. Many bass players believe that tube amplifiers produce a "warmer" or more "natural" sound than solid state amplifiers when lightly or moderately [[fuzz bass|overdriven]], and more pleasing distortion characteristics when heavily overdriven.

Some metal bassists play with a [[fuzz bass]] tone, which is obtained by overdriving the bass signal. Cliff Burton of Metallica used fuzz bass. Lemmy Kilmister, the bassist for Motörhead, obtains a natural fuzz bass tone by overdriving his twin 100 watt Marshall Bass stacks. Fuzz bass can also be obtained with a bass overdrive pedal or an "overdrive" or distortion effect built into their bass amp. The Peavey Century 200 has an onboard "distortion" effect on the second channel. The Peavey VB-2 also has built-in overdrive. Aguilar Amplification's AG 500 bass head is a two-channel amplifier, one of which offers a "saturation" control for overdrive. Metal bassists may also use other [[Effects unit|effects]] to alter their bass sound, such as a [[wah pedal]] (e.g., Cliff Burton) or an [[audio compressor]] to smooth out the sound.

'''Herman Miller, Inc.''', based in [[Zeeland, Michigan]], is an American company that produces [[office furniture]], [[office equipment|equipment]] and home furnishings. Some signature products are the Equa chair, [[Aeron chair]], [[Noguchi table]], [[Marshmallow sofa]], and the [[Eames Lounge Chair]].  Herman Miller is credited with the invention of the office [[cubicle]] (originally known as the "[[Action Office]] II") in 1968 under then-director of research [[Robert Propst (inventor)|Robert Propst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/09/magazines/fortune/cubicle_howiwork_fortune/index.htm?cnn=yes/|title=Cubicles: The great mistake |publisher= ''Fortune Magazine''|date=March 22, 2006|first=Julie|last=Schlosser}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pina1998"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pina | first = Leslie | title = Classic Herman Miller | publisher = Schiffer Publishing | year = 1998 | location = Atglen, Pennsylvania | isbn = 0-7643-0471-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:HermanMillerChippenham.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A typical distribution depot, in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]].]]

Herman Miller was founded in 1905 as the Star Furniture Co. in [[Zeeland, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; Initially the company produced high quality furniture, especially bedroom suites, in historic revival styles.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; In 1909, [[D. J. DePree|Dirk Jan De Pree]] began working for the company as a clerk, and became its president by 1919, when it was renamed the Michigan Star Furniture Co.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; De Pree and his father-in-law, Herman Miller, purchased 51% of the company stock in 1923 and renamed it the Herman Miller Furniture Company. The company reformed as Herman Miller, Inc. in 1960.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;

Until 1930, the company produced only traditional wood furniture.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; With the coming of the [[Great Depression]] the company was forced to explore new products to survive in a shrinking market&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; and reluctantly hired [[Gilbert Rohde]], a designer who specialized in [[modernist]] designs.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; Rohde turned the company in a totally new direction and in 1933, Herman Miller debuted a line of modern furniture at the [[Century of Progress]] exposition in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; In 1941, the company opened a showroom in the [[Merchandise Mart]] in Chicago, and another in [[New York City]]. Under Rohde's supervision Herman Miller entered the contract (office) furniture market in 1942, with the introduction of the "Modular Executive Office" Group (EOG), the first in a long line of office furnishings to be produced by the company.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;

Rohde died in 1944 and was replaced by [[architect]] [[George Nelson (designer)|George Nelson]], who joined the firm as director of design in 1945.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; Over the next four decades Nelson was to have an enormous influence upon Herman Miller, not only for his personal design contributions, but also for the talented designers he recruited to its ranks, including; [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Robert Propst (inventor)|Robert Propst]], and textile designer [[Alexander Girard]].&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; Beginning in the late 1940s, the period under Nelson's guidance saw Herman Miller produce some of the world's most iconic pieces of modern furniture, including the ''[[Noguchi table]]'', ''[[Eames Lounge Chair]]'', ''[[Marshmallow sofa]]'', ''Ball clock'' (actually produced by [[Howard Miller Clock Company]]), and the ''Sling sofa''.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;

Dirk Jan De Pree continued to serve as Herman Miller CEO until 1961, when he was forced by illness to step down. He was succeeded by his son, Hugh De Pree.  Hugh served as company CEO until the mid-1980s, when he was succeeded by his brother [[Max De Pree]], who held the position until 1990.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;

In 1961, Herman Miller set up the Herman Miller Research Division, based in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; This division developed the "[[Action Office]]" line in 1964 under the supervision of Robert Propst and with the design assistance of George Nelson's New York design studio.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; Though the initial line, known as "Action Office I", was not a success, it led Propst to develop the "Action Office II" line, which introduced the "Office [[cubicle]]".&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt; The impact of Action Office II on the workplace revolutionized the office environment. In 1978, Action Office II was renamed simply "Action Office". Herman Miller's line of Action Office products generated sales of over $5 billion {{as of|1998|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;

George Nelson's influence at Herman Miller gradually declined during the 1970s as new designers joined the company, including [[Don Chadwick]] and [[Bill Stumpf]], who co-designed the [[Equa chair]] (still widely marketed), and in the 1990s developed the highly-successful [[Aeron chair]]. In 1981, Herman Miller started to work with the Italian designer [[Clino T. Castelli]] on the process of designing physical environments: a so-called Design Primario&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Margolin, Design Discourse: History, Theory, Criticism, Chicago, Illinois, University of Chicago Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; including CMF Design and Ethospace design concept.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Hall Kaplan, [http://articles.latimes.com/1985-04-07/realestate/re-27787_1_west-week West Week Spotlights Furniture], April 07, 1985, Los Angeles Times&lt;/ref&gt; Designer [[Tom Newhouse]] introduced the "Newhouse Group" of free-standing furniture in 1987, and assisted with the "Ethospace" wall panel system for the Action Office line. [[Ray Wilkes]] designed the "Modular Seating Group", popularly known as the ''Chicklet Chairs''.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;

Artist [[Stephen Frykholm]] is also noted for his contributions to Herman Miller. From 1970 to 1989, Frykholm produced a series of promotional posters for Herman Miller's annual summer picnics, some of which are in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], and remain highly sought-after art prints.&lt;ref name="Pina1998" /&gt;

==Workplace==
According to ''CNN Money'', {{as of|2011|03|lc=y}}, Herman Miller was ranked as the second most admired company in the Home Equipment, Furnishing division. They also scored first in Innovation, People Management, Use of Corporate Assets, Social Responsibility, and Quality of Products/Services. In Quality of Management they scored second place, third in Long Term Investments, fourth in Financial Soundness, and ninth in Global Competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/mostadmired/2011/snapshots/772.html | work=CNN | title=World's Most Admired Companies 2011: Herman Miller snapshot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, they settled an [[Competition law|antitrust lawsuit]] with the states of New York, Michigan, and Illinois for $750,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://blog.mlive.com/chronicle/2008/03/herman_miller_states_settle_su.html|title=Herman Miller, states settle suit on Aeron chair price |publisher= ''Muskegon Chronicle''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit focused on Herman Miller's use of a [[suggested retail price|suggested retail pricing]] policy, which was found to be within the bounds of the law.  Today, many companies employ such policies to avoid price erosion in the internet channel.

==Sustainability==
Herman Miller has engaged in a number of initiatives to promote [[sustainability]], and many of them have had cost-saving implications for the company.  The company has developed a technique of mixing [[sawdust]] with [[chicken manure]] to produce [[topsoil]].  The company also uses a [[database]] to track every chemical in each product used by the company, in order to eliminate harmful chemicals from their products.  Management of the company has expressed concerns about [[global warming]], and the company was using 27% [[renewable energy]] {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.  The company also issues a sustainability report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbiz.com/feature/2007/06/22/herman-miller-bhag-and-internalizing-sustainability Tim Zaun, "Herman Miller, the BHAG, and Internalizing Sustainability", ''GreenerDesign'', Greenbiz.com, Jun. 22, 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Herman Miller's driving sustainability initiatives is its "Perfect Vision" goal. This is a broad initiative that sets significant targets for the year 2020. These targets include zero [[landfill|landfill disposal]], zero [[hazardous waste]] generation, zero air emissions ([[VOCs]]), zero [[Industrial water treatment|process water]] discharge, 100% [[green electricity|green electrical energy]] use, company buildings constructed to a minimum [[LEED Silver]] certification, and 100% of sales from DfE-approved{{clarify|date=May 2017}} products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermanmiller.com/About-Us/Environmental-Advocacy/Our-Vision-and-Policy Our Vision - Herman Miller&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Herman Miller's products are designed to be ecologically sound, and many are good examples of [[ecodesign]] techniques for achieving sustainability include saving materials, energy efficient manufacturing, [[Recycling|recycled]] content, and [[Recycling|recyclable]] content, including design for disassembly.  The design process also utilizes [[life cycle assessment]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Herman Miller helped fund the start of the [[United States Green Building Council]], and hired architect [[William McDonough|William McDonough + Partners]] to design a factory incorporating [[green design]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-reese-halter/herman-miller-embraces-na_b_1676363.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Herman Miller Embraces Nature and Engages Our Youth | date=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building is known as the "Greenhouse", and is an example of [[green building]]. The building won the following awards:
*AIA Committee on the Environment Top Ten Environmental Buildings, 1997
*Business Week/Architectural Record Good Design Is Good Business Award, 1997
*AIA Central Virginia Honor Award, 1998

'''Italian Baroque art''' is a term that is used here to refer to [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque art|painting and sculpture in the Baroque manner]] executed over a period that extended from the late sixteenth to the mid eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The term ''Baroque'' may derive from the Portuguese word ''barocco'' which means an irregularly shaped pearl.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
During the [[Counter Reformation]], the [[Council of Trent]] (1545–63), in which the [[Roman Catholic Church]] answered many questions of internal reform raised by both [[Protestants]] and by those who had remained inside the Catholic Church, addressed the representational arts in a short and somewhat oblique passage in its decrees. This was subsequently interpreted and expounded by clerical authors such as [[Molanus]], the Flemish theologian, who demanded that paintings and sculptures in church contexts should depict their subjects clearly and powerfully, and with decorum, without the stylistic airs of [[Mannerism]].

==The emergence of Italian baroque painting==
Two of the leading figures in the emergence of Baroque painting in Italy were [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]] and [[Annibale Carracci]]

Caravaggio (1571–1610), born and trained in [[Milan]], stands as one of the most original and influential contributors to late sixteenth century and early seventeenth century European painting. Controversially, he not only painted figures, even those of classical or religious themes, in contemporary clothing, or as ordinary living men and women, but his inclusion of the seedier side of life (such as dirty feet) was in marked contrast to the usual trend of the time which was to idealise the religious or classical figure by treating it with the decorum considered appropriate to its status. He used [[tenebrism]] and stark contrasts between partially lit figures and dark backgrounds to dramatic effect. Some of his famous paintings are 'The Calling of St. Mathew', 'St. Thomas', 'The Conversion of St. Paul', 'The Entombment', and 'The Crowning of the Christ'. His use of light and shadow was emulated by the [[Caravaggisti]], the followers of Caravaggio, such as [[Orazio Gentileschi]](1563–1639), [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] (1592-1652/3),&lt;ref&gt;[[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was the daughter of the painter [[Orazio Gentileschi]], and, unusually for the time, was a painter in her own right. Amongst her famous paintings are ‘Judith Slaying Holofernes’ and ‘Self Portrait’ in the Royal Collection, London.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]].
 
Annibale Carracci (1560–1609) came from Bologna where, with his brothers [[Agostino Carracci]] (1557–1602) and [[Ludovico Carracci]] (1555–1619), he set up an influential studio or academy to train painters. Amongst their various  joint commissions, the Carracci carried out the fresco decorations in the [[Palazzo Fava]]. There followed a succession of important altarpieces in which the critical lessons of such artists as [[Correggio]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] are progressively developed and integrated by Annibale within a unifying concept of naturalistic illusionism, based, in particular, upon an unmannered design that is given optical verisimilitude through the manipulation of pure, saturated colors and the atmospheric effects of light and shadow. Two of his famous paintings are ‘The Assumption of the Virgin Mary’ and ‘A Holy Woman at the Tomb of Christ’. In the 1590s he went to Rome to decorate the gallery in the [[Palazzo Farnese]]. This ceiling became highly influential on the development of painting during the seventeenth century. Its exuberance and colour was picked up on by later Baroque painters while the classicising aspects of its design (disegno) influenced painters who followed the more classical cannon. 
 
Other influential painters during this early period who influenced the development of Baroque painting included [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] and [[Guercino]], whilst artists such as [[Guido Reni]]&lt;ref&gt;Guido Reni was received into the guild of painters in 1599, and after 1601 he divided his time between his studios in Bologna and Rome. The frescoes of Raphael and ancient Greek sculptures were the main inspiration for Reni's art. He strove toward a classical harmony in which reality is presented in idealized proportions. The mood of his paintings is calm and serene, as are the studied softness of colour and form. Some of his famous paintings were 'The Adoration of the Shepherds' and 'Salome with the Head of St. John the Baptist'.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Domenico Zampieri]] known as Domenichino, pursued a more classical approach.

==Italian High Baroque painting==
The principal painter of the Roman High Baroque, a period that spanned several papal reigns from 1623 to 1667, was [[Pietro da Cortona]]. His baroque manner is clearly evident in paintings that he executed for the Sacchetti family in the 1620s and the vault fresco in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] (finished 1639) in Rome. During the 1630s, Cortona had a debate at the [[Accademia di San Luca]], the painting academy in Rome, with [[Andrea Sacchi]], a painter with classicising trends, about the perceived differences between their painting styles. The argument essentially concerned the number of figures in a painting and was couched in literary terms, with Cortona arguing for an ‘[[epic (genre)|epic]]’ approach with an abundance of figures and Sacchi making the case for ‘[[tragedy]]’ with fewer figures to convey the messages in a painting.

Baroque painters such as Cortona, [[Giovan Battista Gaulli]] and [[Ciro Ferri]] continued to flourish alongside the classical trend represented by painters such as Sacchi and [[Nicholas Poussin]], but even a classicising painter like Sacchi's pupil [[Carlo Maratta]] was influenced in his use of colour by the Baroque. In the 1672, [[Gian Pietro Bellori]]'s ‘Lives of the artists’ was published. This promoted classical idealism in art so artists of this trend were included (so was Caravaggio) but some of the leading artists of the seventeenth century were omitted such as Cortona, the sculptor [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] and the architect [[Francesco Borromini]].

==Later Italian Baroque painting==

Monumental ceiling frescoes mainly date to the latter part of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Wittower R. ''Art and Architecture in Italy 1600-1750'', p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Some were dramatically illusionistic such as Gaulli's nave fresco (1674-9) in the church of the [[Gesu]] and [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s nave vault (1691-4) in [[Sant'Ignazio]], both in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Illusionistic painting techniques such as [[quadratura]] were often employed by Italian Baroque artists in an architectural context; Andrea Pozzo's ''Perspectiva pictorum et architectorum'', a two-volume treatise on the techniques involved which was published in 1693 and 1700, appeared in various editions and translations during the eighteenth century and became highly influential (Alexander Grönert, ‘Andrea Pozzo’, in ''Architectural theory: from the Renaissance to the present : 89 essays on 117 treatises'', ed. by B. Evers and C. Thoenes (Köln and London: Taschen, c2003), pp. 138–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luca Giordano]] 1634-1705 was born in Naples and was so prodigious in his output of paintings that he was known as ‘Luca fa presto’ (Luke fast work)

Important Venetian painters included [[Sebastiano Ricci]] (1659–1734) and [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] (1683–1754) but the greatest baroque exponent was [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]] (1696–1770). He is renowned for his light palette of colours used with fluid brush strokes, and it is his frescoes rather than his canvases that exhibit these techniques most effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Wittkower, p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; His works include frescoes at the [[Palazzo Labia]] and  the [[Scuola Grande dei Carmini]] in [[Venice]], [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"|Villa Valmarana]] at [[Vicenza]], [[Villa Pisani]] at [[Stra]], works at the [[Würzburg Residence]] and the throne room at the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].  

An important centre of Italian Baroque painting was [[Genoa]]. Many, even from abroad, came to the city to gain Baroque artistic experience, and later went to Venice, [[Florence]], Rome or other important Baroque centres. Prolonged visits to the town were made by artists from other parts of Italy and other countries, including [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Van Dyck]], the French sculptor [[Pierre Puget]], [[Bernardo Strozzi]] and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].

Another Italian city which had a vibrant Baroque movement was [[Milan]]. The city hosted numerous formidable artists, architects and painters of that period, such as Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;Caravaggio's Baroque masterpiece "Basket of Fruit", is held in Milan's Biblioteca Ambrosiana and his "Supper at Emmaus" is held in the Brera Academy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque sculpture==
[[Image:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Bernini]]'s ''[[Ecstasy of St Theresa|Ecstasy of St. Teresa]]''.]]
[[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] (1598–1680) was the leading sculptor of [[Trecento|his day]] and the favorite artist of several popes and their relatives, who gave him important commissions. His ‘Apollo and Daphne’ in the [[Villa Borghese]]  in Rome illustrates how he could precisely capture in white marble the dramatic moment when Daphne, fleeing the pursuing sun god,  realizes she is metamorphosing into a laurel tree. This ability to make expressive dramatic narratives in sculpture can also be seen in his [[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]] (1645–52), created for the [[Cornaro Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]], the Blessed [[Ludovica Albertoni]] in [[San Francesco a Ripa]] in Rome, and St Longinus in [[St Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]]. He was also a fine sculptor of portrait busts. He had a workshop which trained sculptors such as [[Antonio Raggi]] and [[Ercole Ferrata]]. His main rival in sculpture was [[Alessandro Algardi]].

[[Melchiorre Caffà]] (1635–1667) was the pupil of Ferrata and executed ‘The ecstasy of Saint Catherine’ in S Catherina da Siena a Monte Magnapoli in Rome, before his early death.

[[Filippo Parodi]] (1630–1702) was an important sculptor from Genoa. [[Francesco Queirolo]] executed several sculptures for the [[Cappella Sansevero]] in [[Naples]] including the technically demanding ‘Deception unmasked’ (after 1750). [[Giacomo Serpotta]] was the outstanding [[Sicilian Baroque]] sculptor and known particularly for his [[stucco]] figures and decorations in several oratories in [[Palermo]].

'''Jewish Impact Films''' is a fellowship of young [[Jewish]] filmmakers, established in 2004 by leading [[Hollywood]] producers to empower young [[Jew]]s to use creative media, specifically short [[internet]]-based films, to effectively communicate new messaging about [[Judaism]] and [[Israel]].

Senior members of the program include [[David Sacks]], Jason Venokur, Rabbi Yaacov Deyo, [[Brian Ash]], [[David N. Weiss]], Michael Borkow and [[Daniel Kaufman (director)]].

A typical JIF program teams 15 young Jews with a volunteer staff of industry professionals to create 30 short films over the course of a few weeks. The first two fellowships took place in [[Los Angeles]] during the summers of 2004 and 2005. The two more recent programs took place in [[Jerusalem]] in winter 2006 and summer 2006.

In addition to showcasing short films, the site was a gateway to more information about the subjects discussed in the films.

{{nihongo|'''Kei Fujiwara'''|不二稿 京|Fujiwara Kei|born March 12, 1957}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Actor|actress]], [[cinematographer]], [[Editing|editor]], [[writer]] and [[film director]]. Her first role was in the American film, ''[[The Neptune Factor]]'', but she is perhaps best known for starring in the Japanese [[cult film]], ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]''.&lt;ref name="encyclo"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Murguia |first1=Salvador |date=2016 |title=The encyclopedia of Japanese horror films |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9781442261662}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently she has devoted her time to writing and directing, and is known for her [[Surrealism|surreal]] and violent [[Experimental film|experimental films]].&lt;ref name="encyclo" /&gt;

==Biography==
Fujiwara came from a poor family in the country, and moved to Tokyo to pursue a career in [[Theatre|theater]].&lt;ref name="midnight"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mes |first1=Tom |last2=Sharp |first2=Jasper |date=2005 |title=The Midnight Eye guide to new Japanese film |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |isbn=1880656892}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent years creating underground theater companies, and collaborated with [[Shinya Tsukamoto]] on the plays and 8mm films he created. For Tsukamoto's film ''[[Tetsuo: The Iron Man]]'', she participated both in front of the camera as the unnamed Girlfriend character, as well as behind the camera as one of the cinematographers. 

After the production of ''Tetsuo'', she returned to underground theater. She formed the Organ Vital company, which produced the play ''Organ'' and adapted the play into the [[Organ (film)|film of the same name]].&lt;ref name="midnight" /&gt; ''Organ'' and her later 2005 film ''[[Ido (film)|Ido]]'' never gained financial or critical success, but have become noted examples of the Japanese horror genre.&lt;ref name="encyclo" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5349">'''The Magdalena Project''' is an international network of women in contemporary [[theatre]] and [[performance]]. It aims to increase awareness of women's contributions to theatre and to create the artistic and economic structures and support networks to enable women to work.

==Background==

The idea for a network of women theatre practitioners was born in a café in [[Trevignano]], Italy in September 1983, during a festival of alternative theatre: a discussion on the predominance of male directors and writers at the festival led Jill Greenhalgh to ask what such a festival might be like if the primary creative voices were those of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bassnett |first=Susan |authorlink= |title=Magdalena: International Women's Experimental Theatre |origyear=1989 |year=1989 |publisher=Berg Publishers Limited |location=Oxford |isbn=0-85496-016-3 |pages=19–20 |chapter=The Birth of Magdalena}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this, Greenhalgh organised MAGDALENA '86 - The First International Festival of Women in Contemporary Theatre, in [[Cardiff]], Wales in August 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry |first=Chris |authorlink= |title=The Way of Magdalena |origyear=2007 |year=2007 |publisher=The Open Page Publications |location=Denmark |isbn=978-87-87292-13-9 |pages=33–51 |chapter=Magdalena '86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at this event the Magdalena Project was founded.

From then until 1999, The Magdalena Project operated from an administrative base in Cardiff, with a board of advisors and Greenhalgh as its artistic director. During this period the Magdalena Project produced performances, organised workshops and festival gatherings in Europe and published a regular newsletter.

In 1988, women theatre practitioners in Latin America became involved, organising meetings in Peru, Colombia and Uruguay, and extending the network to Chile and Argentina with further meetings in 1993. This was to be the beginning of growing interest in the Project from around the world, with affiliate groups forming and hosting festivals and events in many countries.

In 1999, the [[Arts Council of Wales|Welsh Arts Council]] ceased its infrastructure funding of the Magdalena Project, necessitating the closure of the Cardiff office and the cessation of most cost-bearing activities. However, by this time the network was strongly established at an international level, and was about to launch its web site and email list. The move into online communications ensured the continuation of the network despite the loss of funding.

==International Festivals and Affiliate Groups==

The international membership of the Magdalena Project network is made up of individuals (men and women), theatre companies and organisations; in some locations affiliate Magdalena groups have been formally established. These groups are autonomous and all of their activities are organised and funded locally.

The Latin American network has been operating since 1988 with festivals in Argentina (1999, 2003), Colombia (2002, 2006), Cuba (2005, 2008), Peru (2006) and Brasil (2008). In Argentina, the network has operated under the name Magdalena 2nd Generacion since 1999.

In 1997 Magdalena Aotearoa was officially established in New Zealand and an international festival of women’s performance was held there in 1999. Other festivals outside Europe were held in Australia (2003), USA (2005) and Singapore (2006). The Transit Festival of Women’s Performance is held approximately every three years at [[Odin Teatret]], Denmark, organised by Julia Varley, one of the founders of the Magdalena Project. Other companies and festivals that are connected to the Magdalena Project include [[Grenland Friteater]], Teatro delle Radici, AMAR, DAH Teater, Voix de Femmes, Voix Polyphoniques, Teatret OM, [[Double Edge]] and others.

'''''Mass Effect 2: Overlord''''' is a [[downloadable content]] pack developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for the 2010 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2010, and is included in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of ''Mass Effect 2'', which was released in 2011. Set on a remote [[Earth]]-like planet during the 22nd century, ''Overlord'' follows the events of an experimental [[virtual intelligence]] that has gone rogue.

''Overlord'' comprises a new series of missions for the player to complete and encourages planetary exploration aboard a hovering vehicle called the Hammerhead. Its vehicle exploration aspect was designed to be similar to that found in the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''. ''Overlord'' received positive reviews from critics, who praised its frightening atmosphere and open-ended exploration. Criticism was targeted at the Hammerhead's simplistic combat and unnatural jumping mechanics.

''Mass Effect 2: Overlord'' is a [[downloadable content]] pack for the 2010 [[action role-playing game|action role-playing]] video game ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''. Set on a remote [[Earth]]-like planet called Aite during the 22nd century, it follows the events of an experimental [[virtual intelligence]] that has gone rogue. The player assumes the role of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is ordered by Dr. Gavin Archer to gain access to the station where the virtual intelligence is kept in [[lockdown]] and shut it down. Shepard succeeds, but learns that Archer had been trying to gain influence over a hostile race of networked [[artificial intelligence]]s by interfacing his autistic brother's mind with the virtual intelligence.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; Shepard is then given the option to either take his brother to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with Archer.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt;

''Overlord'' comprises a series of missions that take place in different facilities on the surface of Aite and that generally involve squad-based combat.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt; It unfolds in a [[Nonlinear gameplay|nonlinear]] manner and encourages planetary exploration.&lt;ref name="1UP announcement"/&gt; To go from one mission to another, the player must use a hovering vehicle called the Hammerhead.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt; The player can freely explore Aite aboard the vehicle and change squad members before starting a mission.&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; There is [[side-quest]] that requires the player to collect several data packs on the planet.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; The Hammerhead has the ability to jump over obstacles to reach certain areas and is armed with a gun that the player can use to destroy hostile targets over the planet.&lt;ref name="GSpot guide"/&gt; ''Overlord'' also includes three in-game upgrades, which allow the player to enhance certain aspects of the game's weapons and armor, as well as two [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievements]].&lt;ref name="Achievements"/&gt;

==Development and release==
''Overlord'' was developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. During development of ''Mass Effect 2'', Bioware stated that downloadable content was becoming a fundamental part of the company's overall philosophy.&lt;ref name="IGN interview"/&gt; The pack was announced to be in development on May 13, 2010.&lt;ref name="IGN announcement"/&gt; BioWare executive producer [[Casey Hudson]] stated that ''Overlord'' was the "biggest downloadable content pack yet" and confirmed that they would not introduce more squad members to the game like they did with previous packs.&lt;ref name="Biggest DLC yet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP announcement"/&gt; The developers focused on exploration and vehicle platforming, similar to that found in ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s earlier downloadable content pack ''Firewalker''.&lt;ref name="GS preview"/&gt; Since vehicle exploration was a feature of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'', Hudson called ''Overlord'' "a throwback to how some of the exploration worked in [the first] ''Mass Effect''."&lt;ref name="GS preview"/&gt; The soundtrack was composed by [[Christopher Lennertz]].&lt;ref name="Overlord soundtrack"/&gt; The pack was released on June 15, 2010, for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]]. Like ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s other downloadable content packs [[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi – Stolen Memory|''Kasumi – Stolen Memory'']] and [[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker|''Lair of the Shadow Broker'']], ''Overlord'' is freely included in the [[PlayStation 3]] version of the game, which was released on January 18, 2011.&lt;ref name="IGN version differences"/&gt;

''Overlord'' received positive reviews from critics. Reviewer Erik Brudvig of [[IGN]] described it as "one of the best series of missions that the franchise has yet seen."&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Similarly, reviewer Dan Whitehead of [[Eurogamer]] opined that the pack "never lets one gameplay element dominate for too long, leavening the expected [[Cover system|duck-and-cover]] combat with openworld exploration and a dash of environmental puzzling, all wrapped up in a story that builds to a satisfying and pathos-heavy finale."&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd credited the on-foot action, stating that "a few of the larger environments let you take on [enemies] from multiple angles, which are a nice change from the straight-on encounters that typify most of ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s battles."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; He also praised the final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battle, which he felt exceeded that of the main game.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

Critics generally praised the vehicular sections of the mission. Eurogamer felt that the Hammerhead "responds well to the terrain, with just the right mix of weight and bounciness."&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; IGN considered it an improvement over the Mako carrier featured in the original ''Mass Effect''.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Brad Gallaway of GameCritics, who gave the main game a mixed review, was satisfied with its inclusion and felt that BioWare "managed to incorporate all of the various aspects of ''Mass Effect'' together in a way [he] felt was largely lacking in the core adventure and the previous add-ons."&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]'s Eduardo Reboucas stated similar pros, but admitted that jumping on platforms with the Hammerhead goes against the nature of the game.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt; Likewise, VanOrd felt that the Hammerhead goes underutilized due to its exclusive use in the pack.&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Some reviewers also criticized the simplistic vehicular combat, comparing it unfavorably with that of the original ''Mass Effect''.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

VanOrd gave high marks to the pack's frightening atmosphere, stating that "haunting new music instills a palpable sense of tension, and the dark interior spaces provide a sinister contrast to the shimmering waterfalls and scorching lava rivers on the planet's surface."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; The IGN review observed that the visuals and audio surpass many side quests of the main game.&lt;ref name="IGN review"/&gt; Critics also highlighted very positively the story.&lt;ref name="GRev review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCritics review"/&gt; Eurogamer opined that the ending was effective and unexpected,&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt; while VanOrd remarked that the ending cutscene "features some uncomfortable images that will linger in your mind even after you've returned to the [main game]."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt; Despite evaluating the pack's short length, VanOrd concluded that ''Overlord'' "is one downloadable delight ''Mass Effect 2'' fans shouldn't miss."&lt;ref name="GSpot review"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4558">{{About|the [[Superseded scientific theories|obsolete theory]] of inheritance|the empirically validated genetic phenomenon|Maternal effect}}
The conception of a '''maternal impression''' rests on the belief that a powerful mental (or sometimes physical) influence working on the mother's mind may produce an impression, either general or definite, on the child she is carrying.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock Ellis, ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', vol. 5 p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The child might be said to be "marked" as a result.

==Medicine==
Maternal impression, according to a [[obsolete scientific theory|long-discredited]] [[medicine|medical]] theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of [[birth defect]]s and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an [[emotion]]al [[stimulation|stimulus]] experienced by a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman could influence the development of the [[fetus]]. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]] was frightened by an [[elephant]] during her pregnancy, thus "imprinting" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression|depression]], were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great [[sadness]] might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb.

The theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern [[genetics|genetic theory]].

==Folklore==
In [[folklore]], maternal imprinting, or '''Versehen'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (a [[German language|German]] noun meaning "inadvertance" or as a verb "to provide") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.

[[Oswald Spengler]] understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called "blood feeling" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is called the ''Versehen'' of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would "prove" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on ''one bodily ideal'', so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald, The Decline of the West, Knopf, NYC, 1928, vol. 2 p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] also comments at length about the phenomenon of ''postpartum'' maternal impression in bears, i.e., the folk belief that newborn bears must be licked and molded into bear-shape by their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny Natural History VIII:126&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mixed Blessings''''', also known as '''''Danielle Steel's Mixed Blessings''''', is a 1995 [[NBC]] [[television film]] directed by [[Bethany Rooney]]. The film is based upon the [[Mixed Blessings (novel)|1993 novel of the same name]] written by [[Danielle Steel]]. It contains three stories of couples who are facing parenthood for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.nytimes.com/show/45014/Danielle-Steel-s-Mixed-Blessings-/overview Review Summary] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scott Baio]], [[Bess Armstrong]], [[Gabrielle Carteris]], and [[Bruce Greenwood]] lead the all-star cast.

== Plot ==
Three couples are followed as they struggle to have children. Diana and Andy Douglas are a newlywed couple with great careers trying to have a baby for eleven months, without any results. As they visit the doctor, they are crushed to find out that Diana has problems with her [[ovary]] and she has a 1 in 10,000 chance to become pregnant. Diana, who always wanted to have a child, considers finding a surrogate mother, but the process proves to be very painful because Andy always wanted to have a child as well. She thinks she is preventing him from living his dream and files for divorce.

Eventually, Andy convinces Diana that he only wants to be with her and together, they decide to [[Adoption|adopt]] a child. They find Jane, a student who thinks a baby will destroy her promising future. After giving birth to a girl, Hilary, Diana is filled with joy to finally become a mother. Jane, however, changes her mind and claims her baby back. Meanwhile, Diana turns out to be pregnant after all. In the end, she ends up with two children, following Jane's decision not to have the child after all.

Another plot involves Charlie Winwood, an [[orphan]] who, like Diana, always wanted to have children. He is married to Barbie, an aspiring actress who isn't too enthusiastic to become a mother. While Barbie is on a vacation in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Charlie makes a visit to the doctor and finds out he is sterile. However, five weeks later, Barbie announces she is pregnant, which means she cheated on him. Charlie immediately leaves her and later meets Beth, another orphan who is now enjoying her life as a single mother. They fall in love with each other and soon marry. Not only does Charlie become the father figure of her child, but they also decide to adopt another child.

The plot also centers on Pilar and Brad Coleman, an older couple who, after Brad's daughter announces she is pregnant, decide to try to become pregnant as well. The age proves to be a great obstacle. Even after an artificial insemination, she suffers a miscarriage. Crushed, she decides not to continue the process, until she becomes pregnant. She eventually delivers twins, but one of them dies.

'''Mo Butcher''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Edna Doré]] between 1988 and 1990. She is introduced as the matriarch figure of the Butcher family, [[Frank Butcher]]'s ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) elderly mother. She is portrayed as a battle-axe, tough and interfering. Her most notable storyline first aired in 1990, when the character is used to portray descent into [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Doré opted to leave the serial that same year; Mo was written out of the soap making her last appearance in November. Mo was killed off in 1992, but her death was not screened.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
Mo was born in [[Walthamstow]] in 1910. During her teenage years she married Chike Butcher who worked for [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]. Chike got promoted to transport inspector at the age of forty-five, and Mo felt she had achieved status. They had two children, [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and [[Joan Garwood|Joan]] ([[Mary Millar]]). Following Chike's death, Mo never remarried; she busied herself with caring for Frank's children, particularly when their mother June died in 1987.

===1988–1990===
Mo moves to [[Albert Square]] in September 1988 to be near Frank and his family. She disapproves of the way Frank is raising his teenage children [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Diane Butcher|Diane]] ([[Sophie Lawrence]]) and immediately clashes with his fiancée [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), bringing up her past reputation as a [[prostitute]] and threatening to put a halt to their impending marriage. During her time in [[Walford]] Mo has an array of jobs; she first works in the kitchens of [[The Queen Victoria]], then on [[Arthur Fowler]]'s ([[Bill Treacher]]) fruit and veg stall and then in [[Ali Osman]]'s ([[Nejdet Salih]]) café. However all her jobs come to an end due to her interference, causing her employers no end of grief.

Fiercely loyal to her family, Mo sticks by her son through his financial woes and tries her best to help him out by offering Frank her late husband Chike's life insurance money. She is shown to be extremely fond of her favourite grandchild [[Janine Butcher|Janine]] (Rebecca Michael) and takes a hand in persuading Frank to bring her to Walford to live with him in 1989 (Janine had previously been living with Frank's eldest daughter [[Clare Butcher|Clare]] outside Walford). Despite being protective and doting on her family, Mo is not blinkered to their faults, even in a rare moment supporting Pat in her decision to put Janine in therapy when her behaviour becomes out of control. Mo eventually warms to Pat, seeing that Frank does love her, and arranges for them to be married in great East End style, complete with a horse and carriage, [[Pearly Kings]], a street party and [[jellied eels]].

Her busybody attitude results in few friendships in Walford for Mo, but she becomes close to [[Marge Green]] ([[Pat Coombs]]), despite belittling her. Together they participate in the Walford [[Brownies (Girl Guides)|Brownies]], but Mo (a Brown Owl) is sacked for lying about her age. She also takes on the local council over the proposed closure of the [[community centre]].

In 1990, she becomes increasingly forgetful, and  is eventually diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]] after flooding the B&amp;B and setting fire to the house. Frank feels unable to look after her, and sent her to live with his sister Joan, who looks after Mo in [[Colchester]] until her death on New Year's Eve 1992.

After Frank dies in 2008, his solicitor reads the will in The Vic and presents Janine with Mo's diary from 1990,  which is left to her as per Frank's instructions.

==Creation and development==
1988 was a year of change on-screen in ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the show's inception in 1985 and up until 1988, one of the soap's main focal points, [[The Queen Victoria]] (The Vic) [[public house]], had been inhabited by the Watts family; however, actors [[Leslie Grantham]] and [[Anita Dobson]] who played landlords [[Den Watts|Den]] and [[Angie Watts]] resigned in 1988, meaning the soap's bosses had to find a new family to inhabit the Vic.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; [[Pat Butcher|Pat Wicks]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and her boyfriend [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) were instilled as the new landlords, and along with Frank came his family, including his mother Mo ([[Edna Doré]]), who moved to [[Walford]] in September.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Mo was portrayed as a battle-axe.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|The EastEnders Handbook]] |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0685529576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Hilary Kingsley has described Mo as a "tough, interfering busybody with a will of iron and a face of stone [...] To her grandchildren she was always indulgent, but to Frank she was always the boss, a woman with a whim or iron."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Kingsley surmised that "only slowly did Walford begin to see a softer side to hard bitten old Mo".&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Kingsley described Mo as a woman who sought status, suggesting that she wished to be "Queen Bee" when she moved to Walford and regarded Frank's new wife Pat as "nothing more than a pushy interloper".&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; Initial storylines centred upon clashes between Pat and Mo, with Frank trying to find a compromise between the bickering women in his life. Kingsley has commented that "gradually some sort of compromise was worked out and slowly Mo became more human."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

In 1990, a topical storyline was aired in which Mo was given [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; During the year, Mo was shown to grow increasingly more forgetful, and after tests, Frank was informed that Mo was suffering with dementia. The storyline was scripted to show the effects on a family when a parent/loved one suffers from Alzheimer's.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; By November that year, Mo was in advanced stages of mental deterioration. It was at this stage that the character was written out of ''EastEnders'', Edna Doré having decided to end her contract.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; On-screen, Mo was sent to live with her daughter in Colchester, having convinced herself that Frank wanted to kill her. Writer [[Colin Brake]] has suggested that the storyline had to be curtailed earlier than they would have liked due to Doré's desire to leave.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Commenting on her time in the soap and the reasons for her departure in 1999, Doré said, "I shall always be grateful to ''EastEnders.'' It gave me recognition. It was a marvellous opportunity to be known everywhere, although it totally changes your life. For a while I couldn't even go shopping without being stopped. But compared with the theatre or film it was lacking in job satisfaction because it was so quick. I did it for a couple of years. I didn't want to stay so long that I wouldn't be considered for other parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WEEKEND+TV%3a+Edna+is+so+young+at+heart%3b+Fame+and+fortune+has+come+late...-a060253256|title=Edna is so young at heart.|publisher=''Coventry Evening Telegraph''|date=31 July 1999 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mo was killed off-screen in 1992, succumbing to Alzheimer's; her death was confirmed on-screen in the New Year's Eve episode of 1992. Doré was at a New Year's Eve party when she discovered her character's fate. She commented in 2001, "I was at a New Year's Eve party when someone came up to me and said, 'Have you seen, you've been killed off?' And I heaved a sigh of relief and had another drink. Still I can't complain. I had a good time at ''EastEnders'' and the one advantage of having been in a soap is that I get far better paid for my roles now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WEEKEND+TV%3a+Is+there+life+outside+the+soap+bowl%3f-a079327404|title=Is there life outside the soap bowl?|publisher=''Coventry Evening Telegraph''|date=20 October 2001 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Edna Doré's portrayal of Mo's descent into Alzheimer's has been described as "deeply moving" by John Millar of the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fab+idea+was+just+flogged+to+death.-a061261653|title=Fab idea was just flogged to death|publisher=''Daily Record''|date=11 May 1996 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former executive producer of ''EastEnders'', [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], has suggested that Mo suffering from Alzheimer's in 1990 gave people permission to talk about an illness "that had been almost too distressing to discuss in public before."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; He alleged that viewers informed him that ''EastEnders'' had given them a shorthand "like Mo" to discuss Alzheimer's.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

According to writer Colin Brake, the storyline involving Mo and the unruly Brownies was intended to be fun, but references to Brownies behaving badly caused great offence to the Brownie movement, and an official complaint was made and upheld. The broadcasting commission said the ''EastEnders'' Brownie episodes "came near to parody," were unfair to the Brownies and harmed the [[Girl Guides]]' image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/471606831.html?dids=471606831:471606831&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+12%2C+1990&amp;author=Michael+Hanlon+Toronto+Star&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Poll+tax+blamed+for+pushing+Britons+into+debt&amp;pqatl=google|title=Poll tax blamed for pushing Britons into debt|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=12 March 1990|accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC had to make a public apology for the misinterpretation of the movement.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Brake has suggested that the mishap was a "salutary lesson to those [...] in the script department to be very vigilant in ensuring, as far as possible, that no group or individual was offended by an unintentional slight in a script."&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

The first NADA New York opened at the Center 548, the former [[Dia Art Foundation]] Center, in 2012, simultaneous with the Frieze Art Fair.&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2012/01/nada-will-hold-a-fair-in-new-york-in-may-2012-2/&lt;/ref&gt; From 2013–2016, the fair was held at Pier 36 Basketball City on the Lower East Side. NADA New York has since moved its dates to March, and has moved to the Skylight venues on the west side.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/arts/design/nada-nyc-art-fair-at-basketball-city.html&lt;/ref&gt; Like the fair in Miami, NADA New York is dedicated to showcasing new art, and celebrating rising talents from around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;http://newartdealers.org/Fairs/2015/NewYork&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional programs==
From 2012–2016 NADA partnered with [[Art Cologne]], the world's oldest art fair,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cologne-tourism.com/welcome/news/archive/2015/art-cologne.html&lt;/ref&gt; to showcase emerging galleries from around the world at [[Koelnmesse]] during Art Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/new-art-dealers-alliance-nada-cologne-2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, NADA announced COLLABORATIONS, a curated sector of Art Cologne in which exhibitors present with the theme of collaboration as a starting point, often co-presenting in a shared booth.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krVlHAyMKUg&lt;/ref&gt;

NADA has organized events such as NADA Hudson, a sculpture exhibition at the [[Basilica Hudson]],&lt;ref&gt;http://hyperallergic.com/55011/nada-hudson-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; NADA County Affair, a recurring artist-run county fair,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/nada-county-fair&lt;/ref&gt; and fundraising events such as the Beach Painting Club Auction to benefit the Rockaways&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2013/09/reeder-brothers-beach-painting-club-raises-money-for-rockaways&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Vision and Colors''''' ({{lang-de|Ueber&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; das Sehn und die Farben}}) is a treatise&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Robert Mandelkow]], Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition. Vol.&amp;nbsp;3: Briefe der Jahre 1805-1821 (''Letters of the years 1805-1821''). ''Christian Wegner'' publishers, Hamburg 1965, p.&amp;nbsp;639. "Entsprechend hat Goethe dann auch seiner Abhandlung 'Über das Sehn und die Farben' nur bedingt zugestimmt." (''"Accordingly, Goethe then also only conditionally agreed to his treatise 'On Vision and Colors'."'')&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] that was published in May 1816 when the author was 28 years old. Schopenhauer had extensive discussions with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] about the poet's ''[[Theory of Colours]]'' of 1810, in the months around the turn of the years 1813 and 1814, and initially shared Goethe's views.&lt;ref name=Mandelkow&gt;Karl Robert Mandelkow, Bodo Morawe: Goethes Briefe (''Goethe's Letters''). 1.&amp;nbsp;edition.

Schopenhauer tried to demonstrate [[Physiology|physiologically]] that color is "specially modified activity of the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;''On Vision and Colors'', § 1&lt;/ref&gt;" The initial basis for Schopenhauer's color theory comes from Goethe's chapter on physiological colors, which discusses three principal pairs of contrasting colors: red/green, orange/blue, and yellow/violet. This is in contrast to the customary emphasis on [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] seven colors of the Newtonian [[spectrum]]. In accordance with [[Aristotle]], Schopenhauer considered that colors arise by the mixture of shadowy, cloudy darkness with light. With white and black at each extreme of the scale, colors are arranged in a series according to the mathematical ratio between the proportions of light and darkness. Schopenhauer agreed with Goethe's claim that the eye tends toward a sum total that consists of a color plus its spectrum or [[afterimage]]. Schopenhauer arranged the colors so that the sum of any color and its complementary afterimage always equals unity. The complete activity of the retina produces white. When the activity of the retina is divided, the part of the retinal activity that is inactive and not stimulated into color can be seen as the ghostly complementary afterimage, which he and Goethe call a (physiological) spectrum.

==History==
Schopenhauer met Goethe in 1808 at his [[Johanna Schopenhauer|mother's]] parties in Weimar but Goethe then mostly ignored the young and unknown student. In November 1813, Goethe congratulated Schopenhauer on his doctoral dissertation ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'' which he received as a gift. Both men shared the opinion that visual representations yielded more knowledge than did concepts. In the winter of 1813/1814, Goethe personally demonstrated his color experiments to Schopenhauer and they discussed color theory. Goethe encouraged Schopenhauer to write ''On Vision and Colors''. Schopenhauer wrote it in a few weeks while living in [[Dresden]] in 1815. After it was published, in July 1815, Goethe rejected several of Schopenhauer's conclusions, especially as to whether white is a mixture of colors. He was also disappointed that Schopenhauer considered the whole topic of color to be a minor issue. Schopenhauer wrote as though Goethe had merely gathered data while Schopenhauer provided the actual theory. A major difference between the two men was that Goethe considered color to be an objective property of light and darkness.&lt;ref&gt;"...Goethe...was so completely a ''realist'' that he absolutely could not get it into his head that the ''objects'' as such exist only to the extent that they are ''projected'' by the perceiving subject." Schopenhauer's comment as quoted in Safranski's ''Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy'', Chapter 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[transcendental idealism]] was opposed to Goethe's [[Philosophical realism|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;"It is precisely the astonishing ''objectivity'' of his mind, everywhere stamping his [Goethe's] works with the mark of genius, which stood in his way where it was of value and prevented him from going back to the ''subject'', in this case the perceiving eye itself, in order to seize here the final threads on which hangs the whole phenomenon of the world of colour. On the other hand, coming from Kant's school, I was prepared and trained for satisfying this demand in the best way." Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Chapter VII, § 103.&lt;/ref&gt; For Schopenhauer, color was subjective in that it exists totally in the spectator's [[retina]]. As such, it can be excited in various ways by external stimuli or internal bodily conditions. Light is only one kind of color stimulus.

In 1830, Schopenhauer published a revision of his color theory. The title was ''Theoria colorum Physiologica, eademque primaria'' (''Fundamental physiological theory of color''). It appeared in Justus Radius's ''Scriptores ophthalmologici minores'' (''Minor ophthalmological writings''). "This is no mere translation of the first edition," he wrote, "but differs noticeably from it in form and presentation and is also amply enriched in subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;''On Vision and Colors'', "Preface to the Second Edition,"&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was written in [[Latin]], he believed that foreign readers would be able to appreciate its value.

An improved second edition of ''On Vision and Colors'' was published in 1854. In 1870, a third edition was published, edited by [[Julius Frauenstädt]]. In 1942, an English translation by Lt. Col. E. F. J. Payne was published in [[Karachi]], India. This translation was republished in 1994 by Berg Publishers, Inc., edited by Professor David E. Cartwright.

==Content==

===Preface to the second edition (the first addition had no Preface)===
Although this work is mainly concerned with physiology,&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer claimed that [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] "discovered the phenomenon of physiological colours on which the whole of my theory is based...." The theory was based on Buffon's physiological phenomena and Goethe's data. Schopenhauer, ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Chapter VII, § 104.&lt;/ref&gt; it is of philosophical value. In gaining knowledge of the subjective nature of color, the reader will have a more profound understanding of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] doctrine of the ''a priori'', subjective, intellectual forms of all knowledge. This is in opposition to contemporary [[Philosophical realism|realism]] which simply takes objective experience as positively given. Realism doesn't consider that it is through the subjective that the objective exists. The observer's brain stands like a wall between the observing subject and the real nature of things.

===Introduction===
Goethe performed two services: (1) he freed color theory from its reliance on [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and (2) he provided a systematic presentation of data for a theory of color.

Before discussing color, there are some preliminary remarks to be made regarding vision. In § 1, it is shown that the perception of externally perceived objects in space is a product of the intellect's understanding after it has been stimulated by sensation from the sense organs. These remarks are necessary in order for the reader to be convinced that colors are entirely in the eye alone and are thoroughly subjective&lt;ref&gt;This was also taught by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] (''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', ''Dioptric'', Ch. 1), [[John Locke|Locke]],(''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', Book II, Chapter VIII, § 10), [[Sextus Empiricus]], (''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Book II, Chapter VII, .
§§ 72–75)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter 1—On Vision===

====§ 1====
&lt;ref&gt;In the Preface to the 1st Edition of his main work, Schopenhauer wrote that he omitted "all that is to be found in the first chapter of my essay ''On Vision and Colors'', which otherwise would have found a place here, word for word."&lt;/ref&gt;
Intuitive perception, or knowledge of an object, is intellectual, not merely sensual. The intellect's understanding regards every sense impression in the observer's body as coming from an external cause. This transition from effect to cause is knowledge of the pure understanding, not a rational conclusion or combination of concepts and judgments according to logical laws. Knowledge of an object never results from mere impression, but always from the application of the law of causality, and consequently of the understanding. The law of causality is the sole form of the understanding and the precondition of the possibility of any objective perception.

Illusion occurs when the understanding is given uncommon sensations. If the sensations become commonplace, the illusion may disappear.&lt;ref&gt;As, for example, when a person becomes [[Strabismus|cross-eyed]] due to a blow on the head and sees double. After a time, the person will see normal single images again, while the eyes remain crossed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual understanding, or knowing the objective cause of a subjective sensation, distinguishes animals from plants. All animals are able to intuitively perceive objects.

Color is usually attributed to external bodies. However, color is actually the activity of the eye's retina. It is a sensation. The external body is perceived as the cause of the sensation of color. We say, "The body is red." In reality, though, color exists only in the retina of the eye. It is separate from the external object. Color is a mere sensation in the sense organ. The external object is perceived by the intellect's understanding as being the cause of sensations.

===Chapter 2—On Colors===

====§ 2====
Newton, Goethe, and all other color theorists began by investigating light and colored bodies in order to find the cause of color. They should have started with an investigation of the effect, the given phenomenon, the changes in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Johannes Itten|Itten, Johannes]], ''The Elements of Color'', p. 16, "The light waves are not in themselves colored. Color arises in the human eye and brain."&lt;/ref&gt; we can afterward investigate the external physical and chemical causes of those sensations.

The eye's reaction to external stimulus is an activity, not a passive response. It is the activity of the retina. When the eye's retina receives a full impression of light, or when whiteness appears, it is fully active. When light is absent, or when blackness appears, the retina is inactive.

====§ 3====
There are gradations to the intensity or strength of the retina's activity, or reaction to external stimulus. The undivided activity of the retina is divided into stronger or weaker degrees when stimulated by pure light or whiteness. When influenced by light, the degrees are: Light — Half Shade — Darkness. When influenced by whiteness, the degrees are: White — Gray — Black. In this way, grays are seen. The intensity or energy of the retina's activity increases as more light or whiteness stimulates the eye. These gradations are made possible by the quantitative intensive divisibility of the retina's activity.

====§ 4====
The activity of the retina also has a quantitative extensive divisibility. The whole extent of the retina is divided into countless small juxtaposed spots or points.&lt;ref&gt;"There are about 125,000,000 receptors in each human eye [retina]." ''Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia'', "Vision and the Eye.,"&lt;/ref&gt; Each point is individually stimulated by light or whiteness and reacts separately. The eye can receive many impressions at one time, and therefore side by side.

====§ 5====
The qualitative division of the activity is completely different from the two quantitative divisions. It occurs when color is presented to the eye. Schopenhauer described the way in which various points or places on the retina become fatigued from being overstimulated. After staring at a black figure on a white background, the overactive and excited retinal points become exhausted and do not react to stimulation when the eye finally looks away. A ghostly appearance of a black background is seen with a light-colored figure. The retinal positions that were exhausted by the whiteness become completely inactive. The retinal positions that had been rested are now easily stimulated. This explains [[afterimage]] (physiological spectra). Both Goethe and Schopenhauer use the word "spectrum" [Spektrum], from the Latin word "spectrum" meaning "appearance" or "apparition," to designate an afterimage.

If, instead of white, we stare at yellow, then the afterimage, or physiological color spectrum, is violet. Yellow, unlike white, does not fully stimulate and exhaust the retina's activity. Yellow partially stimulates points on the retina and leaves those points partially unstimulated. The retina's activity has been qualitatively divided and separated into two parts. The unstimulated part results in a violet afterimage. Yellow and violet are the complement of each other because together they add up to full retinal activity. Yellow is closer to white, so it activates the retina more than violet, which is closer to black.

An orange color is not as close to white. It doesn't activate the retina as much as yellow. Orange's complement is blue, which is that much closer to white than was violet. A red color is halfway between white and black. Red's complement is green which is also halfway between white and black. With red and green, the retina's qualitatively divided activity consists of two equal halves.

Red and green are two completely equal qualitative halves of the retina's activity. Orange is 2/3 of this activity, and its complement, blue, is only 1/3. Yellow is ¾ of the full activity, and its complement, violet, is only ¼.

The range of all colors contains a continuous series of innumerable shades that blend into each other. Why are red, green, orange, blue, yellow, and violet given names and considered to be the most important? Because they represent the retina's activity in the simplest fractions or ratios. The same is true of the [[solfège|seven keynotes]] in the musical [[diatonic scale]]: do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti. Color is the qualitatively divided activity of the retina. The retina has a natural tendency to display its activity entirely. After the retina has been partly stimulated, its remaining complement is active as the physiological spectrum or afterimage. In this way, the retina is fully and wholly active.

Knowledge of these six colors is inborn in the mind. They are ideal and are never found pure in nature, in the same way that regular geometrical figures are innate. We have them ''a priori'' in our minds as standards to which we compare actual colors. These three pairs of colors are pure, subjective [[Epicurus|Epicurean]] anticipations because they are expressed in simple, rational, arithmetical ratios similar to the seven tones of the musical scale and their rational vibration numbers.

Black and white are not colors because they are not fractions and represent no qualitative division of the retina's activity. Colors appear in pairs as the union of a color and its complement. Newton's division into seven colors is absurd because the sum of all basic colors cannot be an odd number.

====§ 6====
The qualitatively divided activity of the retina is a polarity, like electricity and magnetism. The retina's polarity is successive, in time, whereas the polarity of the others is simultaneous, in space. The retina's activity, like [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]], is split into two parts which condition each other and seek to reunite. Red, orange, and yellow could be conventionally designated by a plus sign. Green, blue, and violet could be the negative poles.

====§ 7====
According to Goethe, color is like shade or gray in that it is darker than white and brighter than black. The difference between grays and colors, though, is as follows. Light is activity of the retina. Darkness is retinal inactivity. Grays appear when the intensity or strength of the retina's activity is lessened. Colors appear when the whole activity of the retina is divided into partial complementary poles according to ratios. With the merely quantitative, intensive division of the retina's activity, there is only a gradual (by degrees) diminution of the intensity or strength of the retina's full activity. No fractional division of activity in ratios occurs. This lessening of strength by small degrees results in gray shades. However, with the qualitative fractional division of the activity of the retina, the activity of the part that appears as color is necessarily conditioned by the inactivity of the complementary fractional part. The polar contrast between the active and inactive parts results in color. The vivid partial activity of the stimulated retinal spot is supported by that same spot's partial inactivity. Every color's darkness appears as its afterimage, or spectrum. Conversely, when looking at an [[afterimage]], or physiological spectrum, the previously existing color is the darkening factor.

====§ 8====
Newton recognized that color is darker than white or light. He erroneously investigated light instead of the eye, the objective instead of the subjective. In so doing, he asserted that light rays are composed of seven colored rays. These seven were like the seven intervals of the musical scale. Schopenhauer claimed that there are only four prismatic colors: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. The rays described by Newton are supposed to be variously colored according to laws that have nothing to do with the eye. Instead of Newton's division of sunshine into seven rays, Schopenhauer claimed that color was a division of the eye's retina into two complementary parts. Like the [[Oracle|Delphic Oracle]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Schopenhauer concentrated on the subjective rather than the objective, on the observer's experience rather than the observed object. In general, he believed, the subjective viewpoint leads to correct results.

Colors are not in light. Colors are nothing more than the eye's activity, appearing in polar contrasts. Philosophers have always surmised that color belongs to the eye rather than to things. [[John Locke|Locke]], for example, claimed that color was at the head of his list of secondary qualities.

Newton's theory has color as an occult quality. Schopenhauer's theory claims to be more explanatory. He said that each color is a definite + or − side of the division of the retina's activity, expressed as a fraction that reflects the color's sensation.

====§ 9====
When the entire activity of the eye is completely qualitatively partitioned, the color and its spectrum (afterimage) appear with maximum energy as being vivid, bright, dazzling, and brilliant. If the division is not total, however, part of the retina can remain undivided. A union of the quantitative intensive division with the qualitative division of the retina occurs. If the remainder is active, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they fade into white. If the remainder is inactive, then the color and its spectrum are lost as they darken into black. If the remainder is only partially inactive, then the color loses its energy by mixing with gray.

====§ 10====
If the activity of the retina is divided without a remainder, or if the remainder is active, then a color and its spectrum (afterimage) are bright or pale. When such a color and its spectrum are united, then the eye sees pure light or white. For example, the mixture of bright or pale red and green on the same retinal spot results in the impression there of light or white. White cannot be produced by mixing colored pigments. With colors from a prism, however, the production of white can be demonstrated by using a mixture of colored light from each of the three main pairs of complementary colors: red – green, orange – blue, or yellow – violet. White can be produced from two complementary opposite colors when both of the external causes of the colors excite the same retinal place at the same time. Newton claimed that white could be produced by the aggregation of his seven prismatic colors. He erroneously considered color to be in light instead of in the eye. White is the result of the combination of two opposite colors because their inactivity, or darkness, is removed when the two active parts of the retina combine.

According to Newton, refracted light must appear colored. With the [[Achromatic lens|achromatic refractor]], however, this is not the case. Newtonians explain this by saying that the achromatic refractor's [[Crown glass (optics)|crown glass]] and [[flint glass]] refract light as a whole with equal intensity but [[Dispersion (optics)|disperse]] individual colors differently. According to Schopenhauer, achromatism results when refraction occurs in one direction in the concave lens and in another direction in the convex lens. A blue band then overlaps an orange band while a violet edge covers the yellow. The qualitatively divided retina (color) is thus reunited in full activity, resulting in achromatism (the absence of color).

If an observer looks through a prism at a white disk on a black background, two subsidiary images are seen. This is due to double refraction as the light bends twice, when entering and leaving the prism. With this double refraction, the two subsidiary images appear as one above and one below the main image. The distance of the two subsidiary images from the main image corresponds to the Newtonians' dispersion. The wideness or narrowness of the colored bands are, however, nonessential properties that differ according to the type of light-refracting substance that is used. The top of the upper image is violet. Below the violet is blue. The bottom of the lower image is orange. Above the orange is yellow. In this way, along with the white disk and the black background, four prismatic colors appear: violet, blue, yellow, and orange. This is in disagreement with Newton's claim that there are seven prismatic colors. As the upper image overlaps black, it is seen as violet. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as blue. As the lower image overlaps black, it is seen as orange. Where it overlaps white, it is seen as yellow. This shows how colors are produced when the image mixes with either lightness or darkness, in accordance with Goethe's assertions.&lt;ref&gt;"[L]ight and its absence, are necessary to the production of colour." "[C]olours throughout are to be considered as half-lights, as half-shadows...." ''Theory of Colours'', Introduction. "Colour itself is a degree of darkness...." ''Ibid.'', § 69. Color appears in semi-transparent media when dark passes over light or ''vice versâ''. ''Ibid.'', § 239.when&lt;/ref&gt;

====§ 11====
In the operation of a healthy eye, three kinds of division of retinal activity often occur at once. (1) The quantitative intensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in a loss of color energy and a deviation toward paleness or darkness; (2) After being excited by an external stimulant, the quantitative extensive division unites with the qualitative division resulting in the retina being covered by many various juxtaposed spots of color sensation; (3) When the stimulation ceases, an [[afterimage]] (physiological spectrum) appears on each retinal spot.

====§ 12====
Afterimages (spectra) appear after a mechanical shock to the eye. The eye's activity is convulsively divided. Transitory pathological spectra appear from glare or dazzle. The retina's activity is disorganized from over-stimulation. A dazzled eye sees red when looking at brightness and green when looking into darkness. The retina's activity is forcefully divided by the powerful stimulation. When the eye strains to see in dim light, the retina is voluntarily activated and intensively divided. Blue eyeglasses counter the effect of orange candlelight and produce the effect of daylight. An additional proof of the subjective nature of color, namely that it is a function of the eye itself and is only secondarily related to external objects, is given by the [[Daguerrotype|daguerreotype]]. It objectively shows that color is not essential to the appearance of an object. Also, people who are [[Color blindness|color blind]] would see color if it was in the object and not in the eye.

====§ 13====
Colors and the laws by which they appear reside within the eye. The external cause of color is a stimulus which excites the retina and separates its polarity. Goethe had organized color into three classes: physiological, physical, and chemical. He proposed that the external causes of color are physical colors and chemical colors.&lt;ref&gt;"...we considered colours, as far as they may be said to belong to the eye itself, and to depend on an action and reaction of the organ; next they attracted our attention as perceived in, or by means of, colourless mediums; and lastly, where we could consider them as belonging to particular substances. We have denominated the first, physiological, the second, physical, the third, chemical colours. The first are fleeting and not to be arrested; the next are passing, but still for a while enduring; the last may be made permanent for any length of time." Goethe, ''Theory of Colours'', Introduction. The physiological colors are subjective and literally exist in the eye of the beholder. The physical colors are seen through cloudy or turbid media, like a glass or water prism. The chemical colors are objective and exist in the external object.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The investigations of Newton started with chemical (objective) colors as given and, from them, explained physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored physiological (subjective) colors. Goethe also started with chemical (objective) colors. From them, he explained physical (seen through prism) colors and physiological (subjective) colors. Schopenhauer, on the contrary, started with physiological (subjective) colors as given. He then used them to explain physical (seen through prism) colors. He ignored chemical (objective) colors.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Physical colors=====
Physical colors are temporary. They exist when light combines with cloudy transparent or translucent media, such as smoke, fog, or a glass prism. They are comprehensible because we know that they result from part of the qualitative division of retinal activity. Light is the external physical stimulus of the retina's activity. The more that we know about the effect (color as physiological fact), the more we can know ''a priori'' about its external cause. (1) The external stimulus can only excite color, which is the retina's polar division. (2) There are no individual colors. Colors come in pairs because each color is the qualitative part of the retina's full activity. The remaining part is the color's complementary color. (3) There are an infinite number of colors. Three pairs are distinguished by names of their own, however, because the retina's activity is bipartitioned in a rational proportion that consists of simple numbers. (4) A color's external cause, acting as a stimulus, must be capable of being changed and infinitely modified as much as the retina's activity can be infinitely divided qualitatively. (5) In the eye, color is a cloudy shade of white. This shadiness is the retina's resting part while the other retinal part is active. Newton's theory asserts that each prismatic color is 1/7 of the whole of light. If an infinite number, instead of seven, of light rays is assumed, then each color would be an infinitely small fraction of the whole of light. Schopenhauer's theory, however, claims that yellow is ¾ as bright as white. Orange is 2/3, red is ½, green is ½, blue is 1/3, and violet is ¼ as bright as white. The external cause of color is a diminished light that imparts just as much light to the color as it imparts darkness to the color's complement. Unlike Goethe, for Schopenhauer the primary phenomenon, or limit of explanation, is not an external cause, but the "organic capacity of the retina to let its nervous activity appear in two qualitatively opposite halves, sometimes equal, sometimes unequal...."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''On Vision and Colors'', § 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The accepted conjecture regarding the retina's organic capacities was later published in the [[Young-Helmholtz theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Chemical colors=====
Chemical colors are more durable properties of an external object, such as the red color of an apple. A chemical color is incomprehensible because we don't know its cause. Its appearance is only known from experience and it is not an essential part of the object. Chemical colors result from changes in an object's surface. A slight change in the surface may result in a different color. Color, therefore, is not an essential property of an object. This confirms the subjective nature of color.

====§ 14====
Schopenhauer said that he didn't have to worry about his discoveries being attributed to previous thinkers. "For, prior to 1816, never at any time did it occur to anyone to regard color ... as the halved activity of the retina, and accordingly to assign to each individual color its ''definite numerical fraction'' — a fraction that, with another color, goes to make up unity, this unity representing white or the full activity of the retina." Schopenhauer criticized scientists for thinking that color exists in external objects, instead of in the spectator's eye. Color as vibrations of an [[Luminiferous aether|ether]] was rejected by him. [[Fraunhofer lines]], according to Schopenhauer, do not exist in light itself. They result from the edges of the slit that light passes through.

RA Crone - Documenta ophthalmologica, 1997 - Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

==Letter to Eastlake==
In 1841, Schopenhauer wrote a letter in English to [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] whose English translation of Goethe's book on colors had recently been reviewed in several journals. Schopenhauer included a copy of his ''On Vision and Colors'' with the letter. He briefly communicated the main point of his book as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...if, bearing in mind the numerical fractions, (of the activity of the Retina) by which I express the 6 chief colours, You contemplate these colours singly, then You will find that only by this, and by no other theory on earth, You will come to understand the peculiar sensation, which every colour produces in your eye, and thereby get an insight into the very essence of every colour, and of colour in general. Likewise my theory alone gives the true sense in which the notion of complementary colours is to be taken, viz: as having no reference to light, but to the Retina, and not being a redintegration [restoration] of white light, but of the full action of the Retina, which by every colour undergoes a bipartition either in '''yellow (3/4) and violet (1/4)''' or in '''orange (2/3) and blue (1/3)''' or in '''red (1/2) and green (1/2)'''. This is in short the great mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here he explained that color results from the way that the retina reacts to sensation. The cause may be light or other pressure on the retina. The fractions of two complementary colors sum to unity. White is undivided, whole retinal activity.

==Reception==
[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]] were strongly influenced by Schopenhauer's works and both seriously investigated [[color theory]]. [[Philipp Mainländer]] considered the work to be among the most important things ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Philosophie der Erlösung|last=Mainländer|first=Philipp|publisher=|year=1876|isbn=|location=|pages=420|quote=Es ist hier der richtige Ort, ein Verdienst Schopenhauer’s hervorzuheben, nämlich die ''wahre Theorie der Farbe'' geliefert zu haben. Er that es in seiner vortrefflichen Schrift: »Ueber das Sehn und die Farben«, die ich zu dem Bedeutendsten zähle, was je geschrieben worden ist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Itten]] based his work on Schopenhauer's theory of color. 

The mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer|Brouwer]] wrote: "Newton's theory of color analyzed light rays in their medium, but Goethe and Schopenhauer, more sensitive to the truth, considered color to be the polar splitting by the human eye."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brouwer|first=L.E.J.|date=|title=Life, Art, and Mysticism|url=https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ndjfl/1039886518|journal=Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic|volume=Volume 37, Number 3, Summer 1996|pages=413|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist [[Ernst Mach]] praised that "men such as Goethe, Schopenhauer" had started to "investigate the sensations ''themselves''" on the first page of his work ''Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/dieanalysederemp1902mach#page/n17/mode/2up|title=Die Analyse der Empfindungen und das Verhältnis des Physischen zum Psychischen|last=E. Mach|first=|publisher=Gustav Fischer|year=1902|isbn=|location=Jena|pages=20|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Rudolf Arnheim]], Schopenhauer’s "&amp;hellip;basic conception of complementary pairs in retinal functioning strikingly anticipates the color theory of [[Ewald Hering]]."&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Arnheim, ''Art and Visual Perception'', Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted that the [[Bohemia]]n physiologist, [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak|Professor Czermak]], acknowledged Schopenhauer’s relation to the [[Young-Helmholtz theory]] of color.&lt;ref&gt;"I recently found in the reports of the Vienna Academy of Sciences an article by Professor Czermak on Schopenhauer's theory of colors. [Johann Nepomuk Czermak, ''Über Schopenhauers Theorie der Farbe: ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Farbenlehre'' (''Regarding Schopenhauer's theory of color: a contribution to the history of color theory''), Vienna, 1870].  This confirms that Schopenhauer discovered independently and originally what is now known as the ''[[Young–Helmholtz theory]]'' of colors: the latter and the Schopenhauerian theory correspond in a most marvelous way, down to the very infinitesimals. It is claimed that the whole point of departure, color as primarily a physiological product of the eye, was first established by Schopenhauer."

Indianapolis/ Cambridge, Letter to Carl von Gersdorff,  Basel, December 12, 1870)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bosanquet]] claimed that Schopenhauer’s color theory was in accord with scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;"Schopenhauer's ingenious modification and defence of Goethe's colour theory appears to be in harmony with modern [1892] physiological ideas. He interprets Goethe's account of colour as light mixed with darkness, to mean that colour involves a partial activity of the retina (light), and a partial inactivity (dark), and lays down the principle that the retina always tends to a complete activity, the parts of which, if not simultaneous, as in white light, are successive, as in complementary images." (''A History of Aesthetic,'' [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], page 366, note 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''F.lli Pinfari S.r.l''' was an Italian ride manufacturing company based in [[Suzzara]], Italy. Pinfari was liquidated on 15 July 2004, due to the [[early 2000s recession]] and the weakness of the [[United States dollar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bannister.org/coasters/manuf/pinfari.htm|title=Fratelli Pinfari S.r.I.|last=Bannister|first=Richard F.|year=2007|work=Roller Coasters: Manufacturers|accessdate=15 December 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117105602/http://www.bannister.org/coasters/manuf/pinfari.htm|archivedate=17 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, its brand and intellectual property was acquired by Interpark Amusements [[Società a Responsabilità Limitata|Srl]], based in [[Modena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinfari.com/company/about-interpark-amusements.html|title=About Interpark Amusements Srl|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company, commonly known as '''Pinfari''', was established in 1926 building Dodgem cars and buildings. Its first roller coaster was a wild mouse-style ride in 1954 called "bob-slide." In 1965 the company introduced a small portable coaster called '''Zyklon'''. These coasters proved very popular with [[funfair|traveling fairs]] and carnivals as wells as permanent [[amusement park]]s. Pinfari manufactured Zyklons in several variations and sizes, building over 200 since the ride's introduction.&lt;ref name=RC98&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Seifert | first1 = Jeffrey  | year = 2006 | title = The Early Steel Coaster Manufacturers | journal = RollerCoaster! Magazine |volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 6-7 |  publisher=American Coaster Enthusiasts | location=Zanesville, Ohio | issn = 0896-7261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The models were designated Z40, Z47, Z64 and Z78 — "Z" representing Zyklon and the number representing the length of the coaster base  in meters (i.e. the footprint of a Z47 is {{Convert|47|m}} by {{Convert|18.5|m}}). In the 1980s Pinfari added loops to the Zyklon model and marketed them as a Looping Zyklon or Looping Star. The model designation added the letter "L" sometimes next to the Z and sometimes after (i.e. ZL42, ZL50 or Z47L).&lt;ref name=RC98 /&gt; The company also manufactured a popular children's coaster called Big Apple, nearly identical in design to Wacky Worms and Brucomela coasters by Preston and [[Fabbri Group|Fabbri]].

In the late 1990s Pinfari introduced a new model to eventually replace the Zyklon, although the Zyklon was still offered in the ride catalog. Known simply as Roller Coaster or Thriller Roller Coaster, these models were designated [[RC-48|RC48]], RC50 or RC70, with the larger RC70 having two loops and a corkscrew. The company also introduced a large non-looping family coaster designated FC80. The first RC70 was installed at [[M&amp;D's]] Theme Park in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Tornado|location=M&amp;Ds Scotland's Theme Park|rcdb_number=1070|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and only FC80 was built at [[Prater|Wiener Prater]] in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Super 8er Bahn|location=Wiener Prater|rcdb_number=1095|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinfari continued to expand its product line offering a junior inverted coaster in 1999 and a suspended looping coaster, with the first two suspended looping models going to Nigloland in France and Moreno's Park, a traveling show in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Bat Coaster|location=Nigoland|rcdb_number=1482|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite RCDB|coaster_name=Xpress|location=Cicinatela Park|rcdb_number=9015|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of roller coasters==

&lt;!-- This is a list of existing projects and CONFIRMED future projects. "Confirmed" means the park has issued a press release announcing it (acceptable) or a reliable source (i.e., local newspaper) has published an article mentioning its construction (preferable). This is not a wish-list nor is it a place for speculation and rumor. --&gt;

As of 2018, Pinfari has built 182 [[roller coaster]]s&lt;!--see ref--&gt; around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rcdb.com/6862.htm Pinfari - rcdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Possession: A Romance''''' is a 1990 best-selling novel by British writer [[A. S. Byatt]] that won the 1990 [[Booker Prize]]. The novel explores the [[postmodern]] concerns of similar novels, which are often categorised as [[historiographic metafiction]], a genre that blends approaches from both historical fiction and [[metafiction]].

The novel follows two modern-day academics as they research the paper trail around the previously unknown love life between famous fictional poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. ''Possession'' is set both in the present day and the Victorian era, contrasting the two time periods, as well as echoing similarities and satirising  modern [[academia]] and mating rituals. The structure of the novel incorporates many different styles, including fictional [[epistolary novel|diary entries, letters]] and poetry, and uses these styles and other devices to explore the [[postmodern]] concerns of the authority of textual narratives. The title ''Possession'' highlights many of the major themes in the novel: questions of ownership and independence between lovers; the practice of collecting historically significant cultural artefacts; and the possession that biographers feel toward their subjects.

The novel was adapted as a [[Possession (2002 film)|feature film]] by the same name in 2002, and a serialised radio play that ran from 2011 to 2012 on BBC Radio 4. In 2005 ''[[Time Magazine]]'' included the novel in its list of ''100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html | work=Time | title=All-Time 100 Novels | date=16 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the novel was listed on the BBC's survey [[The Big Read]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top200.shtml "BBC – The Big Read"]. BBC. April 2003. Retrieved 31 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The novel concerns the relationship between two fictional [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] poets, Randolph Henry Ash (whose life and work are loosely based on those of the English poet [[Robert Browning]], or [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], whose work is more consonant with the themes expressed by Ash, as well as Tennyson's having been poet-laureate to Queen Victoria) and Christabel LaMotte (based on [[Christina Rossetti]]),&lt;ref name="Parini"/&gt; as uncovered by present-day academics Roland Michell and Maud Bailey. Following a trail of clues from letters and journals, they collaborate to uncover the truth about Ash and LaMotte's relationship, before it is discovered by rival colleagues. Byatt provides extensive letters, poetry and diaries by major characters in addition to the narrative, including poetry attributed to the fictional Ash and LaMotte.

[[A. S. Byatt]], in part, wrote ''Possession'' in response to [[John Fowles]]' novel ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969). In an essay in Byatt's nonfiction book, ''On Histories and Stories'', she wrote:
{{quote|Fowles has said that the nineteenth-century narrator was assuming the omniscience of a god. I think rather the opposite is the case—this kind of fictive narrator can creep closer to the feelings and inner life of characters—as well as providing a Greek chorus—than any first-person mimicry. In 'Possession' I used this kind of narrator deliberately three times in the historical narrative—always to tell what the historians and biographers of my fiction never discovered, always to heighten the reader's imaginative entry into the world of the text.&lt;ref name ="ASB H&amp;S"&gt;A.S. Byatt ''On Histories and Stories'' (2001), p. 56. qtd in Lisa Fletcher "Historical Romance, Gender and Heterosexuality: John Fowles’s The French Lieutenant’s Woman and A.S. Byatt’s Possession", Journal of Interdisciplinary Gender Studies vol.7 2003, p30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot summary==
Obscure scholar Roland Michell, researching in the [[London Library]], discovers handwritten drafts of a letter by the fictional eminent [[Victorian era|Victorian]] poet Randolph Henry Ash, which lead him to suspect that the married Ash had a hitherto unknown romance.  He secretly takes away the documents – a highly unprofessional act for a scholar – and begins to investigate.  The trail leads him to Christabel LaMotte, a minor poet and contemporary of Ash, and to Dr. Maud Bailey, an established modern LaMotte scholar and distant relative of LaMotte. Protective of LaMotte, Bailey is drawn into helping Michell with the unfolding mystery.  The two scholars find more letters and evidence of a love affair between the poets (with evidence of a holiday together during which – they suspect – the relationship may have been consummated); they become obsessed with discovering the truth. At the same time, their own personal romantic lives – neither of which is satisfactory – develop, and they become entwined in an echo of Ash and LaMotte. The stories of the two couples are told in parallel, with Byatt providing letters and poetry by both of the fictional poets.

The revelation of an affair between Ash and LaMotte would make headlines and reputations in academia because of the prominence of the poets, and colleagues of Roland and Maud become competitors in the race to discover the truth, for all manner of motives. Ash's marriage is revealed to have been unconsummated, although he loved and remained devoted to his wife. He and LaMotte had a short, passionate affair; it led to the suicide of LaMotte's companion (and possibly lover), Blanche Glover, and the secret birth of LaMotte's illegitimate daughter during a year spent in [[Brittany]]. LaMotte left the girl with her sister to be raised by her, and passed off as her own. Ash was never informed that he and LaMotte had a child.

As the [[Great Storm of 1987]] strikes England, the interested modern characters come together at Ash's grave, where they intend to exhume documents buried with Ash by his wife, which they believe hold the final key to the mystery. Reading them, Maud learns that rather than being related to LaMotte's sister, as she has always believed, she is directly descended from LaMotte and Ash's illegitimate daughter. Bailey thus is heir to the correspondence by the poets. Freed from obscurity and a dead-end relationship, Michell remedies the potential professional suicide of stealing the original drafts, and sees an academic career open up before him. Bailey, who has spent her adult life emotionally untouchable, finds her human side and sees possible future happiness with Michell. The sad story of Ash and LaMotte, separated by the mores of the day and condemned to secrecy and separation, has a kind of resolution through the burgeoning relationship between Bailey and Michell.

In a brief epilogue, it is revealed that both the modern and historical characters ''(and hence the reader)'', have for much of the latter half of the book, misunderstood the significance of one of Ash's key mementoes.

==Reception==
American writer [[Jay Parini]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'', wrote "a plenitude of surprises awaits the reader of this gorgeously written novel. A. S. Byatt is a writer in mid-career whose time has certainly come, because ''Possession'' is a tour de force that opens every narrative device of English fiction to inspection without, for a moment, ceasing to delight." Also "The most dazzling aspect of ''Possession'' is Ms. Byatt's canny invention of letters, poems and diaries from the 19th century".&lt;ref name="Parini"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE0D8153FF932A15753C1A966958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fByatt%2c%20A%2e%20S%2e | title=Unearthing the Secret Lover | work=The New York Times | accessdate=23 October 2014 | author=Parini, Jay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Christopher Lehmann-Haupt]], writing in the ''New York Times'', noted that what he describes as the "wonderfully extravagant novel" is "pointedly subtitled 'A Romance'."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; He says it is at once "a detective story" and "an adultery novel."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DD143CF936A15753C1A966958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fByatt%2c%20A%2e%20S%2e Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, Books of The Times; "When There Was Such a Thing as Romantic Love"], ''The New York Times'', 25 October 1990. Retrieved 23 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' online, [[Sam Jordison]], who described himself as "a longstanding Byatt sceptic", wrote that he was: "caught off-guard by ''Possession's'' warmth and wit"  ... "Anyone and everything that falls under Byatt's gaze is a source of fun." Commenting on the invented 'historical' texts he said their "effect is dazzling – and similarly ludic erudition is on display throughout." ... "Yet more impressive are in excess of 1,700 lines of original poetry". "In short, the whole book is a gigantic tease – which is certainly satisfying on an intellectual level" but,'' "Possession's'' true centre is a big, red, beating heart. It's the warmth and spirit that Byatt has breathed into her characters rather than their cerebral pursuits that makes us care". Concluding, "There's real magic behind all the brainy trickery and an emotional journey on top of the academic quest. So I loved it."&lt;ref name="Sam Jordison"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/18/book-club-possession-as-byatt | title=Guardian book club: Possession by AS Byatt | publisher=[[The Guardian]] 19 June 2009 | accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radley''' is a London-based, British accessories brand which designs and manufactures handbags, purses and other women's accessories for UK and international markets. The brand was founded by Lowell Harder in 1998. Justin Stead is the current CEO of the brand and was appointed in May 2015.&lt;ref name="basics"&gt;{{cite web|last=Faulkner|first=Ruth|title=Bag to Basics|url=http://www.drapersonline.com/news/multiples/the-drapers-interview/bag-to-basics/5041932.article|work=Drapers Magazine|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
Radley founder and current Creative Director, Australian Lowell Harder, began working in the accessories industry as a weekend stall holder on London's [[Camden Market]] in 1984 selling Indian men's accessories brand [[Hidesign]]. Harder began working with the Hidesign design team and together developed new designs for the UK market.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

Harder's business with Hidesign soon outgrew its market stall setting and needed increased investment and infrastructure which was supplied by the handbag company Tula Group in 1991. With the backing of the Tula Group, Harder was able to continue with Hidesign and in 1997, with a new working partner, develop a new women's accessories brand, Radley.

‘Harder launched it [Radley] in 1998 after becoming "fed up" with seeing bags in the same colours – such as black and navy. Instead she wanted to create something different and colourful,' wrote Drapers trade magazine in an interview with Harder in 2012.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

Initial sales of Radley were low, however through a pre-existing relationship with Department store John Lewis via Hidesign, John Lewis began to trial a selection of Radley designs. Radley became a success for [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]], which then led to an interest from other UK based department stores.

==Scottie dog logo==
In an October 2012 interview with Drapers trade magazine, Radley founder Lowell Harder said of the conception of the brand's dog shaped logo 'we were experimenting with different things and one of the designers came-up with it. We hung it off a bag and people loved it.'&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

The dog logo, which hung from the bag strap, was put on a few ranges in the collection for Autumn/Winter 2000 but was added to most of the range by 2001 because of increased interest from customers. After the departure of Harder in December 2010, the new design team implemented a new version of the dog logo which saw a negative reception from the consumer. In her October 2012 [[Drapers]] magazine interview, she explained why the original design of the logo was reinstated on her return 'He was changed after I left and was made too butch. The idea of him was that he was meant to look cute and fun so we are going back to that…it was important to us that we changed him back.'&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==First buy-out==
With the increased sales of Radley in 2002, Harder led a buyout of Tula Group from its founding members. Tula and Hidesign were maintained as brands&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==Second buy-out==
[[Phoenix Equity Partners]] purchased a majority stake of Radley in a £45m deal in March 2006. It was listed again for sale the following December in 2007. The majority stake was purchased in a second buyout by private equity fund Exponent Private Equity in a transaction valued at £130m.  Exponent Private Equity presently maintains their majority ownership to this day alongside Radley's management team and Phoenix Equity Partners reinvested as minority stakeholders.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==Retail==

===UK===
The company's first store opened in 2005 on London's [[Kings Road]]. There are currently 19 full-price Radley stores and 14 outlets in the UK. The brand is also currently stocked in a number of other retail locations and department stores across the UK including British retailers [[Fenwick (department store)|Fenwick]] Ltd, [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] and [[House of Fraser]].&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

===International===
Radley is currently stocked in Germany, [[Switzerland]], Japan, Russia, South Africa, [[Thailand]], and [[New Zealand]]. The bags are also available at Macy’s in the United States.

===Online===
Radley started online trading in 2007 and is currently stocked online in the UK by John Lewis, [[House of Fraser]], [[Next plc|Next]] and [[Shop Direct]].

==Rebranding==
The company re-branded in Autumn 2009 to Radley London.

==Collaborations==
In 2013, Radley collaborated with the Scottish fashion designer [[Holly Fulton]] for a capsule collection of accessories. In 2010, and again in 2013, Radley announced a partnership with [[Harris Tweed]], to incorporate the Scottish textiles into their handbag designs. There have also been capsule collections with the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] and illustrators William Grill, Emma Cowlam and Rory Crichton.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt;

==Brand ambassadors==
From Spring/Summer 2012 through to Spring/Summer 2013, [[Vogue (British magazine)|Vogue]] UK's contributing Editor [[Laura Bailey (model)|Laura Bailey]] was Radley's Brand Ambassador. The partnership also saw the launch of two capsule collections co-designed by Bailey. For Autumn/Winter 2013, British model [[Erin O'Connor]] appeared in Radley's UK advertising campaign.

==Product offering==
The brand currently produces handbags, small leather goods, luggage, hats, scarves, gloves, eyewear, casual footwear, watches, gifts and stationery.&lt;ref name="basics"/&gt; Radley launched their signature fragrance Radley London in March 2015. The fragrance is available in an Eau De Parfum, body wash and body lotion.

==Charity==

===British Heart Foundation===
Radley has maintained a working relationship with the [[British Heart Foundation]], a UK based cardiovascular research charity, over the last five years. In that time Radley has produced two capsule collections with a portion of the proceeds being donated to the charity.

[[File:RichardD'OylyCarte.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|Richard D'Oyly Carte]]
'''Richard D'Oyly Carte''' (3 May 1844 – 3 April 1901) was an English talent agent, theatrical [[impresario]], composer and hotelier during the latter half of the [[Victorian era]]. Rising from humble beginnings, Carte built two of London's theatres and a hotel empire, while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day.

Carte started his career working for his father, [[Richard Carte]], in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English [[comic opera]] could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]] and composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] and, together with his wife [[Helen Carte]], he nurtured their collaboration on a series of thirteen [[Savoy opera]]s. He founded the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and built the state-of-the-art [[Savoy Theatre]] to host the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.

Carte also built the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London, and acquired other luxury hotels. In addition, he erected the [[Palace Theatre, London]], which he had intended to be the home of a new school of English [[grand opera]], although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''. Nevertheless, his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, and his careful management of their operas and relationship, created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre. His opera company, later operated by Helen and then by his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], and granddaughter, [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte|Bridget]], promoted those works for over a century, and they are still performed regularly today.

==Early life==
[[File:Richard-carte.jpg|thumb|left|Carte's father, Richard]]
Carte was born in [[Greek Street]] in the [[West End of London]] on 3 May 1844.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He was the eldest of six children. His father, [[Richard Carte]] (originally Cart; 1808–1891), was a [[flautist]], and his mother was the former Eliza Jones (1814–1885); they had eloped, to the disappointment of her father, Thomas Jones, a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;Young, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt; His siblings were Blanch (1846–1935), Viola (1848–1925), Rose (b. 1854), Henry (1856–1926) and Eliza (1860–1941). Carte was of Welsh and [[Normans|Norman]] ancestry; D'Oyly is a Norman French name which "was a forename (not part of a double surname)".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name comes from his mother's grandmother, Elizabeth D'Oyly, who was a descendant of Peregrine D'Oyly of Overbury Hall in [[Layham]], Suffolk (c. 1625–1667).&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement his income as a performer, Carte's father joined the firm of Rudall, Rose &amp; Co., musical instrument makers and music publishers, in 1850.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11&lt;/ref&gt; After he became a partner in the business, it changed its name to Rudall, Rose, Carte and Co. and later to Rudall, Carte &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;"New Music", ''The Era'', 21 March 1869.

==Career==
Between 1868 and 1877, Carte wrote and published the music for a number of his own songs and instrumental works, as well as several comic operas: ''Doctor Ambrosias – His Secret'', at [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]] (1868);&lt;ref&gt;"Music and Musicians", ''The Daily News'', 12 April 1895&lt;/ref&gt; ''Marie'', with librettist E. Spencer Mott, at London's [[Opera Comique]] in 1871;&lt;ref name=Ainger92&gt;Ainger, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Original Correspondence", ''The Era'', 10 September 1871&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Happy Hampstead'', with librettist [[Frank Desprez]], which debuted on an 1876 provincial tour and then played at the [[Royalty Theatre]] in 1877.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; On tour in 1871, Carte conducted ''[[Cox and Box]]'' by composer [[Arthur Sullivan]] and dramatist [[F. C. Burnand]], in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces, called ''Rose of Auvergne'' and ''Breaking the Spell'', in which Carte's client [[Selina Dolaro]] appeared.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 5 September 1871, p. 1. The composer's brother, [[Fred Sullivan]], managed the tour and played Cox, while [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]] played Bouncer, in ''Cox and Box''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's musical talent would be helpful later in his career, as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross&lt;ref&gt;Classified ad in ''The Era'', 20 November 1870, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and, by late 1874, from a nearby address in Craig's Court,&lt;ref&gt;Classified ad in ''The Era'', 27 December 1874, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture management agency.&lt;ref name=Joseph8/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ainger92/&gt; His two hundred clients eventually included [[Charles Gounod]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], [[Adelina Patti]], [[Giovanni Matteo Mario|Mario]], [[Clara Schumann]], [[Antoinette Sterling]], [[Edward Lloyd (singer)|Edward Lloyd]], [[Thomas German Reed|Mr. and Mrs. German Reed]], [[George Grossmith]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesketh Pearson]] said of Carte: "His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took what other people thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry."&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, ''quoted'' in Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding his opera company===
[[File:Trial by Jury cover.jpg|right|thumb|Programme for ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', 1875]]
In 1874, Carte leased the [[Opera Comique]], a theatre off [[Strand, London|the Strand]], where he presented [[Charles Lecocq]]'s new [[opéra bouffe]] ''[[Giroflé-Girofla]]'', given in French by the company who had premiered the work three months earlier in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;"Opera Comique", ''The Era'', 7 June 1874, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed this with ''The Broken Branch'', an English adaptation of [[Gaston Serpette]]'s ''La branche cassée''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter: "It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera."&lt;ref&gt;"Our Representative Man", ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', 10 October 1874, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' reported, "Mr D'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager, but a trained musician, and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe, and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order, such as a musician might produce with satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 23 August 1874, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte later said it was "the scheme of my life" to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera,&lt;ref name="Joseph, p. 11"&gt;Joseph, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the [[wikt:bawdy|bawdy]] [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 108–09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 128–29&lt;/ref&gt; His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], "I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art."&lt;ref name=Joseph27&gt;Joseph, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with [[H. B. Farnie]] to write a new operetta on the theme of ''[[Dick Whittington and His Cat]]'', which played during the Christmas season at the [[Alhambra Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Art and Literary Gossip", ''[[The Manchester Times]]'', 29 August 1874&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gänzl|Gänzl, Kurt]].

In 1875, Carte became the business manager of the [[Royalty Theatre]], under the direction of his client, the popular singing actress Madame [[Selina Dolaro]]. There he programmed Offenbach's ''[[La Périchole]]''. To fill out the evening (as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre), he needed another piece. He remembered a libretto for a one-act [[comic opera]] that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873, called ''[[Trial by Jury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Sullivan's popular 1867 opera, ''[[Cox and Box]]'', had been revived at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in 1874, and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty. Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]]'' in 1871, and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for ''Trial by Jury''.&lt;ref name=Ainger108&gt;Ainger, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, George. "Whose ''Zoo''; or, When Did the ''Trial'' Begin?", ''Nineteenth Century Theatre Research'', 12, December 1984, pp. 39–54&lt;/ref&gt; Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre, and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well-crafted English light operas, Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Vorder Bruegge, Andrew.

Carte managed the first tour of ''Trial by Jury'', which stopped at the Theatre Royal in [[Dublin]], Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name [[Helen Lenoir]]. She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English [[comic opera]]&lt;ref name="Ainger, p. 111"/&gt; and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary.&lt;ref name=Joseph134&gt;Joseph, pp. 134–35&lt;/ref&gt; Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved in all of his business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years after the death of his first wife.&lt;ref name=helenDNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/59169}} accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the initial production of ''Trial by Jury'', however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s ''La Périchole'', and ''[[La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein]]'', Lecocq's ''[[La fille de Madame Angot]]'' and [[Léon Vasseur]]'s ''La Timbale d'argent''), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (''Happy Hampstead'' and ''Trial by Jury''). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included [[W.H. Denny]].&lt;ref name=whowaswho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 4 July 1876, p. 6; ''The Freeman's Journal'' (Dublin), 28 July 1876, p. 1; and ''The Era'', 23 July 1876, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wachs, Kevin.

Encouraged by the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Carte made attempts in 1875–76 to raise money for either a revival of ''Thespis'' or a new piece.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 113 and 119&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he finally found four backers and formed the "Comedy Opera Company" to produce the future works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], along with the works of other British author/composer teams.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 130–31&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Helen Lenoir had been promoted from Carte's secretary to his assistant.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan's ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1877, with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast, instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced, as had been the case with their earlier works. They chose talented actors, few of whom were well-known stars, and Carte's agency provided many of the artists.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133–34&lt;/ref&gt; The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right: there was a promising future in family-friendly English comic opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 141–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Sorcerer'' was followed by ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' in 1878. Business for the new opera was slow at first.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's investors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan, who included some of the ''Pinafore'' music in several [[promenade concert]]s at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]], ''Pinafore'' became a hit.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879, a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage.&lt;ref name=joseph18&gt;Joseph, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The three each put up £1,000 and formed a new partnership under the name "[[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|Mr Richard D'Oyly Carte's Opera Company]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 162–67&lt;/ref&gt; Under the partnership agreement, once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted, each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

On 31 July 1879, the last day of their agreement with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the ''Pinafore'' set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, pp. 170–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-opcom.html "The Fracas at the Opera Comique",] ''The Theatre'', 1 September 1879, reprinted at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 6 May 2009.

Pinafore'' in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan.&lt;ref name=joseph18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Supreme Court of Judicature, Aug. 1 – Court of Appeal – Gilbert v.

''H.M.S.

To try to counter this [[copyright infringement|copyright piracy]] and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America, Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an "authentic" production of ''Pinafore'' there, beginning in December 1879, as well as American tours.&lt;ref name=Ainger182&gt;Ainger, pp. 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; Carte's assistant, Helen Lenoir, who became his wife in 1888, made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; Beginning with ''Pinafore'', Carte licensed the [[J.

In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera, ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879, prior to its 1880 London premiere.&lt;ref name=Ainger182/&gt; They hoped to forestall further "piracy" by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto.

Carte had been planning to build a new theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and, in particular, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=savoyard&gt;"100 Electrifying Years", ''The Savoyard'', Volume XX no. 2, D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, September 1981, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 172–72&lt;/ref&gt; With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency, he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment, where he built the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1881. Carte chose the name in honour of the [[Savoy Palace]], which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by [[Peter of Savoy, Earl of Richmond|Peter, Count of Savoy]]. It later passed to [[John of Gaunt]] but was destroyed in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Savoy Theatre was a state-of-the-art facility, setting a new standard for technology, comfort and decor. It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; and seated nearly 1,300 people (compared to the Opera Comique's 862).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. P.

''Patience'' was the first production at the new theatre, transferring there on 10 October 1881.

At that performance, Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology.&lt;ref name=bettany&gt;Bettany, unnumbered page (there are no page numbers in the book)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' concluded that the theatre "is admirably adapted for its purpose, its acoustic qualities are excellent, and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with."&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''The Times'', 11 October 1881, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Strand, including the Savoy Theatre, and a depiction of Richard D'Oyly Carte, are featured in [[Nicholas Meyer]]'s 1976 novel ''[[The West End Horror]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Carte and his manager, [[George Edwardes]] (later famous as manager of the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]), introduced several innovations at the theatre including free programme booklets, the orderly "queue" system with numbered tickets for the pit and gallery (an American idea), tea served at the interval and a policy of no tipping for [[cloakroom]] or other services.&lt;ref name=bettany/&gt; Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dark and Grey, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas were premiered at the Savoy, and all of their operas came to be known as [[Savoy opera]]s.

===Peak years for the opera company===
During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams, as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were [[Savoy opera#Companion pieces|companion pieces]] to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of ''Patience'' in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of ''Patience'', Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with ''Patience'', two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta ''[[Olivette (opera)|Olivette]]'' (co-produced with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]]), one with ''[[Claude Duval (opera)|Claude Duval]]'' in America, a production of ''Youth'' running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of ''Patience'', ''Pirates'', ''Claude Duval'' and ''[[Billee Taylor]]'' in association with [[J. C. Williamson]] in Australia, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091001081006/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/museum/patience/250perf/pc250.html 250th Anniversary ''Patience'' programme, 1881]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights, increasing the works' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti, as well as the rental of band parts.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 81 and 163.&lt;/ref&gt; This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to "the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas".&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year.&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394"/&gt;

After ''Patience'', Carte produced ''[[Iolanthe]]'', which opened in 1882. During its run, in February 1883, Carte signed a five-year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan, obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months' notice.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long-term contract necessary for his security.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 217–19&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments, "Effectively, [the contract] made [Gilbert and Sullivan] Carte's employees – a situation which created its own resentments."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html "The Carpet Quarrel Explained",] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023151629/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/html/quarrel.html |date=23 October 2010 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 28 June 1997, accessed 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership's next opera, ''[[Princess Ida]]'', opened in January 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 225–26&lt;/ref&gt; Carte soon saw that ''Ida'' was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera. The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music,&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The Times'', 27 May 1878, p. 6, favourably reviewing ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', nevertheless added, "we cannot suppress a word of regret that the composer on whom before all others the chances of a national school of music depend should confine himself ... to a class of production which, however attractive, is hardly worthy of the efforts of an accomplished and serious artist."&lt;/ref&gt; and after he was knighted in 1883, the pressure only increased. He soon regretted having signed the five-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1884, Sullivan told Carte that "it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself."&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt;

During this conflict and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen.&lt;ref name=Joseph27/&gt; Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions.&lt;ref name=jacobssullivan&gt;Jacobs, Arthur. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26772?docPos=7 "Sullivan, Arthur Seymour",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ''Pirates'' premiered on 31 December 1879, so technically it's seven, but Joseph counts it as eight. --&gt; When ''Princess Ida'' closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, for the first time in the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 230–33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|left|Lithograph from ''The Mikado'']]
Carte produced the first revival of ''The Sorcerer'', together with ''Trial by Jury'', and matinees of ''The Pirates of Penzance'' played by a cast of children, while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work. This became the partnership's most successful opera, ''[[The Mikado]]'', which opened in March 1885.&lt;ref name=Wilson13&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and "picturesque" Far East.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Brian. "Japan in London 1885", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', issue 22, Winter 2007, pp. 686–96&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mikado'' became the partnership's longest-running hit, lasting for 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre, and supplanting ''Patience'' as the second-longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time.&lt;ref name=Longest/&gt; It was extraordinarily popular in the US and worldwide and remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bradley|first=Ian|url=http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/hrgsp/old/productions/mik97/mik97hist.htm |title=Note on the popularity of '&amp;#39;The Mikado'&amp;#39; |publisher=Hcs.harvard.edu |accessdate=27 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John.]] [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm "G&amp;S101: G&amp;S Story: Part III"], Musicals101.com, accessed 8 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership's next opera was ''[[Ruddigore]]'', which opened in January 1887. The piece, though a financial success, was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Ruddigore'' closed after nine months, Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year. After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a "lozenge plot", Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio-comic plot for ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'', which premiered in October 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The opera ran for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. This was a happy time for Carte, with a long-running opera, new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction.&lt;ref name=Wilson13/&gt; When Carte asked his partners for a new work, Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera, asking if Gilbert would write a "dramatic work on a larger musical scale".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted: the two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan could work on a [[grand opera]] that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; The new comic opera was ''[[The Gondoliers]]'', which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership's greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years, Carte was not just the manager of the theatre. He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants);&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 15–18&lt;/ref&gt; and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Lytton]], "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Lytton, Henry. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html ''Secrets of a Savoyard''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706175513/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html |date=6 July 2008 }} (1922), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; [[Queen Victoria]] honoured the company by calling for a [[Royal Command Performance]] of ''The Gondoliers'' at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that "gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths." Carte rejoined, "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority."&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], writing in ''[[The World (journal)|The World]]'' in October 1893, stated:

===End of the partnership and last years===
[[File:Ivanhoe-programme.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'' programme cover]]
On 22 April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre, including a new £500&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |title=Approximately £37,818.60 in 2006 prices |access-date=19 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714064621/http://www.measuringworth.com/ukcompare/result.php?use%5B%5D=CPI&amp;use%5B%5D=DEFIND&amp;use%5B%5D=WAGE&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPC&amp;year_early=1890&amp;pound71=500&amp;shilling71=&amp;pence71=&amp;amount=500&amp;year_source=1890&amp;year_result=2006 |archive-date=14 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; carpet for the front lobby of the theatre, were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte. Gilbert angrily confronted Carte, but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts. Even though the amount of the charge was not great, Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte's integrity, and he could not look past it. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".&lt;ref name=Crowthcarpet/&gt; Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Matters deteriorated further, and Gilbert brought a lawsuit. Sullivan sided with Carte, who was building the [[Palace Theatre, London|Royal English Opera House]], the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated, but his actions had been hurtful to his partners, and the partnership disbanded.&lt;ref name=Vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc. "Introduction: Historical Context", ''The Grand Duke'', p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009.

Carte's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'', which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera, but no other operas shared the new opera house with it. Instead, ''Ivanhoe'' was presented every night with alternating casts. When ''Ivanhoe'' finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with [[André Messager]]'s ''[[La Basoche]]'' at first alternating in repertory with ''Ivanhoe'', and then ''La Basoche'' played alone, closing in January 1892.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. [[Henry J. Wood|Sir Henry Wood]], who had been [[répétiteur]] for the production, recalled in his autobiography, "If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of ''Ivanhoe'' I was already preparing ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'' with [[Eugène Oudin]] in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the ''Dutchman'' was shelved."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Henry.

[[File:Glad to See You Together.png|thumb|220px|left|The ''Entr'acte'' expresses its pleasure that Gilbert and Sullivan are reunited.]]
Because of the carpet quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Vowed/&gt; When ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. He turned to old friends [[George Dance (dramatist)|George Dance]], [[Frank Desprez]] and [[Edward Solomon]] for his next piece, ''[[The Nautch Girl]]'', which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and [[Sydney Grundy]]'s ''[[The Vicar of Bray (opera)|The Vicar of Bray]]'', which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's ''[[Haddon Hall]]'', which held the stage until April 1893.&lt;ref name=joseph111&gt;Joseph, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.&lt;ref&gt;"The Savoyards on Tour", ''The Sketch'', 13 June 1894, pp. 373–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's aggressive, though successful, legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan, but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer. After several attempts by the Cartes, the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], who published the sheet music to their operas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wolfson| first=John| year=1976| title=Final curtain: The last Gilbert and Sullivan Operas|page=7 |publisher=Chappell in association with A. Deutsch| location=London | ISBN=0-903443-12-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration, ''[[Utopia, Limited]]''. While ''Utopia'' was being prepared, Carte produced ''[[Jane Annie]]'', by [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], with music by [[Ernest Ford]]. Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle, the show was a flop, closing after only 51 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Tillett, Selwyn.

[[File:Comic Opera at the Savoy.png|right|thumb|[[George Grossmith]] comforts Carte after failure of ''[[The Grand Duke]]'']]
''Utopia'' was Carte's most expensive production to date, but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances, until June 1894.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; Carte then played first ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', composed by [[André Messager]], then ''[[The Chieftain]]'', by [[Francis Burnand|F. C. Burnand]] and Sullivan. These ran for 102 and 97 performances, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The company then toured the London suburbs, and the theatre was dark during the summer of 1895, reopening in November for a revival of ''[[The Mikado]]''.&lt;ref name=Wilson52&gt;Wilson and Lloyd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1896 by ''[[The Grand Duke]]'', which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan's only financial failure. ''The Gondoliers'' turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan's last big hit, and after ''The Grand Duke'', the two men never collaborated again.&lt;ref name=joseph111/&gt; At the Savoy, Carte produced ''[[His Majesty (comic opera)|His Majesty]]'' (1897), ''[[The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein]]'' (1897), ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' (1898) and ''[[The Lucky Star]]'' (1899), as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=Wilson52/&gt;

Though the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than hits in the theatre, his hotel business prospered and grew. He acquired [[Simpson's-in-the-Strand]]&lt;ref name=savoy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021221064512/http://www.the-savoy-group.com/Simpsons/AboutUs/History/history.asp The Savoy Group, history pages, Simpson's-in-the-Strand], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Claridge's]] Hotel, both of which he entirely rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claridges.co.uk/page.aspx?id=1846 The Savoy Group, history pages, Claridge's], accessed 1 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; There was one grave setback, in 1897, when he had to dismiss his manager, Ritz, and his star chef, Escoffier, for financial misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Brigid, Allen.

He was determined to engage M. Joseph, proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris, then at the height of its fame. Carte was seriously ill, but he insisted on being carried to the boat-train. In Paris he bought the Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 10 June 1904, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies.&lt;ref name=helenDNB/&gt; In 1894, Carte had hired his son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], as an assistant.

Carte was married twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853–1885), the daughter of [[Keith Prowse|William Prowse]], a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte.&lt;ref name=Ainger75/&gt; They married in 1870&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; and had two sons, Lucas (1872–1907) and [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]].&lt;ref name=j132&gt;Joseph, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885,&lt;ref name=j132/&gt; and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, [[Helen Carte|Helen]].&lt;ref name=Joseph134/&gt; Their wedding took place in the [[Savoy Chapel]], with [[Arthur Sullivan]] as the best man.&lt;ref name=goodman&gt;Goodman, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father's assistant in 1894. Lucas, who was not involved in the family businesses, became a [[barrister]]. He was appointed Private Secretary to [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]] in 1899 in connection with the [[Schomburgk Line|Venezuelan boundary arbitration]] in Paris. There he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and later died of that disease at the age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas was born on 27 December 1872 and was educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He was called to the bar in 1897. After he contracted tuberculosis, he worked for the rest of his life on issues relating to the disease and died on 18 January 1907. See Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte's London house was at the [[Adelphi, London|Adelphi]], not far from the Savoy.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Passionate about the visual arts as well as the performing arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James McNeill Whistler]], to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1890, he bought a small island in the [[River Thames]], between [[Weybridge]] and [[Shepperton]], called Folly Eyot, which he renamed [[D'Oyly Carte Island]]. He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new [[Savoy Hotel]], but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property.&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, Rutland (1908). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dT1AAAAAIAAJ ''Rutland Barrington: A Record of 35 Years' Experience on the English Stage, By Himself''], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling, Keith. [http://www.thamespathway.com/chapter10/richard-doyly-carte.aspx "Richard D’Oyly Carte"], ''Thames Pathway: Journal of a Walk Down the River Thames'', 2009 {{ISBN|1445222396}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riverthames.co.uk/about_thames/3763.htm "Shepperton Lock",] ''About the Thames'', accessed 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 124. Baily speculates that Carte's sense of humour was a bond with Gilbert just as his "cultured musical mind" was a bond with Sullivan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Richard DOyly Carte Grave.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Carte's grave at St Andrews Church, Fairlight]]
Carte died at his London home from [[dropsy]] and heart disease in 1901, just short of his 57th birthday.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=R. D'Oyly Carte is Dead. The Famous Theatrical Manager Had Long Been an Invalid.

A memorial service was held at the Chapel Royal of the Savoy, where a memorial stained glass window was later dedicated to him.&lt;ref name=goodman/&gt; He left an estate valued at £250,000.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This sum is equivalent to more than £100,000,000 in 2007 values: see [http://www.measuringworth.com measuring worth.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid-Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence, with knighthoods for actors, such as [[Henry Irving]], and for dramatists, including Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Baily, p. 128 ''quoting'' Gilbert, describing mid-19th century productions as "crude, unintelligent, and sometimes frankly improper"&lt;/ref&gt; George Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte's theatrical legacy, "Mr D'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera; raised operatic inscenation to the rank of a fine art; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera."&lt;ref&gt;''The World'', 2 August 1893, ''quoted'' in Laurence, p. 592&lt;/ref&gt; In Carte's obituary, ''[[The Times]]'' noted, "By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the ''mise en scène'' of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch. He set a high standard".&lt;ref name=timesobit/&gt; Beyond this, however, Carte's influence, through the production of the Savoy operas, heavily influenced the course of the [[Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan#Musical theatre|development of modern musical theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bargainnier, Earl F. "W. S. Gilbert and American Musical Theatre", pp. 120–33, ''American Popular Music: Readings from the Popular Press'' by Timothy E.

Carte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected: in the words of the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'': "Led by the prince of Wales [the Savoy] became the meeting place for London high society and the ''nouveaux riches'' of the British empire.... [The] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there. It allowed ladies, hitherto fearful of dining in public, to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms."&lt;ref&gt;Ashburner, F.[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/50441 "Escoffier, Georges Auguste (1846–1935)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, May 2006, accessed 17 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Planter in the Embankment Gardens behind the [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
Carte left the theatre, opera company, hotels and his other business interests to Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, pp. 111–27&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to [[William Greet]], overseeing his management of a revival of ''Iolanthe'' and several new comic operas.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Rupert became chairman of the [[Savoy Hotel]] by 1903, which Helen continued to own.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 138 and 186&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death in 1913, Helen passed the family businesses to Carte's son, Rupert. He maintained the hotel business, disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome, but expanding the group in London.&lt;ref name=profit/&gt; The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994.&lt;ref name=billions&gt;Prynn, Jonathan.

Rupert D'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, as well as provincial and foreign tours.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 160 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Bradley | first = Ian| authorlink=Ian Bradley|title = Oh Joy!

*"Come Back to Me", words and music by Carte.&lt;ref&gt;"New Music", ''The Era'', 21 March 1869. The paper commented, "In this case Mr. D'Oyly Carte's music is a vast deal better than his words. The song... musically speaking, is a creditable production."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sahitya Akademi''', [[India]]'s National Academy of Letters, is an organisation dedicated to the promotion of [[literature]] in the [[languages of India]].&lt;ref name=hota&gt;{{cite book|last=Hota|first=AK|title=Encyclopaedia of New Media and Educational Planning|year=2000|publisher=`|isbn=978-81-7625-170-9|pages=310–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1IW8UwPfzUC&amp;pg=PA311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded on 12 March 1954, it is supported by, though independent of, the Indian government. It is in Rabindra Bhavan near [[Mandi House]] in [[Delhi]].

The Sahitya Akademi organises national and regional workshops and seminars; provides research and travel grants to authors; publishes books and journals, including the Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature; and presents the annual [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] of Rs. 100,000 (approx. USD 1,500 (in year 2013)) in each of the 24 languages it supports, as well as the [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]] for lifetime achievement.

The Sahitya Akademi Library is one of the largest multi-lingual libraries in India, with a rich collection of books on literature and allied subjects.

It publishes two bimonthly literary journals: ''[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]'' in English and ''Samkaleen Bharatiya Sahitya'' in Hindi.&lt;ref name=hota/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Academies: Sahitya Akademi|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/sahitya.php|work=[[Government of India]]|accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History  ==
The idea of constituting a National Academy of Letters in India was considered by the colonial British government, and in 1944 a proposal from the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal for the formation of a 'National Cultural Trust' was, in principle, accepted. The original plan conceived of three institutions, or academies, devoted to the visual arts, performing arts, and letters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent Government of India carried out this proposal, constituting a National Academy of Letters, called the 'Sahitya Akademi' by a government resolution on 15 December 1952.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first General Council of the Akademi included members such as [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]], [[Abul Kalam Azad]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], [[K. M. Panikkar|K.M. Panikkar]], [[Kanaiyalal Maneklal Munshi|K.M. Munshi]], [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]], [[Umashankar Joshi]], [[Mahadevi Varma]], [[D. V. Gundappa]], [[Ramdhari Singh Dinkar]], and was presided over by the then-Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Government of India clarified that the choice of Prime Minister Nehru as the first chairperson was "not because he is Prime Minister, but because he has carved out for himself a distinctive place as a writer and author."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Sahitya Akademi was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954 in New Delhi. A ceremony was held in the [[Parliament of India|Indian Parliament]]'s Central Hall, with speeches by Maulana [[Abul Kalam Azad]] and [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]]. S. Radhakrishnan elaborated on the purpose of the Sahitya Akademi in his speech, noting that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The phrase, Sahitya Akademi, combines two words. 'Sahitya' is Sanskrit, and 'Academy' is Greek. This name suggests our universal outlook and aspiration. Sahitya is a literary composition; Academy is an assembly of men who are interested in the subject. So Sahitya Akademi will be an assembly of all those who are interested in creative and critical literature. It is the purpose of this Akademi to recognise men of achievement in letters, to encourage men of promise in letters, to educate public taste and to improve standards of literature and literary criticism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A key concern in the early days of the Sahitya Akademi was the establishment of its autonomy from the Central Government. This concern was echoed by the Prime Minister, who noted that, "...it is an honour to be the President of an organisation which includes it in its fold the eminent writers of India in various languages. As President of that Akademi I may tell you quite frankly, I would not like the Prime Minister to interfere in my work."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Council made recommendations to amend the Akademi's governing constitution, including proposals to have the chairman elected by the Council and not appointed by the Government.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these suggestions were incorporated, and the Akademi was constituted as a society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860, as it had not originally been incorporated by an Act of Parliament, but by an executive order.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Council was reconstituted and elected Prime Minister Nehru as its president, and he continued in that capacity until his death in 1964.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Subsequent presidents of the Sahitya Akademi have included [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]] (1958) who succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru after serving as the Vice-President along with him; [[Zakir Husain (politician)|Zakir Hussain]] (1963); [[Suniti Kumar Chatterji|Suniti Kumar Chatterjee]] (1967); [[K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar|K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar]] (1969, and re-elected in 1973); [[Umashankar Joshi]] (1978); [[Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya]] (1983); [[U. R.

==== International seminars ====

The Sahitya Akademi periodically holds International Seminars, sometimes in collaboration with the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]]. The first international seminar was held in 1961, in New Delhi, to mark 100 years since the birth of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. About 25 writers from 16 countries, along with 39 writers from India met over four days to discuss and commemorate Tagore's works. Attendees included [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Martin Wickramasinghe|Martin Wickremesinghe]], [[Jean Guéhenno|Jean Guehenno]], [[Zaki Naguib Mahmoud]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], and [[Louis Untermeyer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Amrita Pritam]], Ramdhari Sinha Dinkar, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, and [[Premendra Mitra]]. In 1991, the Akademi organised a second International Seminar on Tagore in collaboration with the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]], the [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] and the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]].

The Akademi's second International Seminar in 1975 was also held in New Delhi and focused on the Ramayana tradition in Asia. Participants, including U Thein Han, Soewito Santoso, Harry M. Buck, C.E. Godakumbra, Kapila Vatsyayan, Camille Bulke and Umashankar Joshi, presented 44 papers on Ramayana traditions, which were published by the Akademi in a commemorative volume.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Five Decades of The National Academy of Letters, India: A Short History of Sahitya Akademi|last=Rao|first=D.S.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|year=2004|isbn=|location=New Delhi|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second International seminar on the same theme was held in New Delhi in 1981.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Annual Festival of Letters ====
The Sahitya Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters is held in February and is the occasion at which the Akademi presents its [[Sahitya Akademi Award|awards]].

==== Samvatsar Annual Lecture ====
The Samvatsar Annual Lecture is organised by the Sahitya Akademi and is delivered during the Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters. The Sahitya Akademi notes that these lectures "should open up new vistas of thinking regarding a literary movement, a current literary trend, some original thinking about a great writer or a great classic or a new path in literary criticism or literary creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/samvatar_lectures.jsp|title = Sahitya Akademi: Samvatsar Lectures|date = 26 November 2014|accessdate = |website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lectures have been delivered since 1986 by people including the Hindi writer [[Sachchidananda Vatsyayan]] (1986), Marathi poet and writer [[Vinda Karandikar]] (1991), Assamese novelist [[Nabakanta Barua]] (1994), and Malayalam author and director, [[M T Vasudevan Nair]] (1999).&lt;ref name="Samvatsar Lectures"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sahitya-akademi.gov.in/sahitya-akademi/literaray-activities/samvatar_lectures.jsp|title = Samvatsar Lectures|date = |accessdate = 26 November 2014|website = Sahitya Akademi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sreenivasa Rao, is controversial as Rao’s academic credentials for the top job, who had joined the Akademi as a lower division clerk (LDC), are said to be insufficient and extremely dubious.

The 171st Parliamentary Standing Committee on the functioning of Sahitya Akademi and three other institutions chaired by [[Sitaram Yechury]] and tabled at the [[Loksabha]] in August 2011 states, "It was felt that most of these institutions were not able to live up to the original mandates set out by their founding fathers. Controversies of different kind involving these institutions that keep cropping up from time to time, had caught this Committee’s attention. Questions were also raised about the indifference and helplessness shown by the [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]] to do anything in the face of autonomy enjoyed by these institutions."

The Committee also urged Sahitya Akademi to adopt the recommendation of the [[P. N. Haksar|Haksar]] Committee (1988) of having its head appointed by the President of India, a practice followed by [[Sangeet Natak Akademi|Sangeet Natak]] and [[Lalit Kala Akademi|Lalit Kala]] Akademies, to avoid "the inevitable complications of the existing system of elections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=171st Report of Parliamentary Committee|url=http://www.rgics.org/test/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Functioning-of-Sahitya-Akadem-Lalit-Kala-Akademi-Sangeet-Natak-Akademi-and-National-School-of-Drama.pdf|publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat, New Delhi|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084016/http://www.rgics.org/test/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Functioning-of-Sahitya-Akadem-Lalit-Kala-Akademi-Sangeet-Natak-Akademi-and-National-School-of-Drama.pdf|archivedate=2014-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial appointments ===

Many controversial appointments of unqualified candidates to key positions at the Sahitya Akademi, done during [[Gopi Chand Narang]]'s time, continue unchallenged to this day. Khurshid Alam and Mrignayani Gupta, both dismissed in 2004 for presenting counterfeit degree certificates, have made a backdoor entry and have been subsequently promoted to higher positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Srivastava|first1=Mihir|title=Scam charges cloud Sahitya Akademi|url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main7.asp?filename=Ne103004scame_charges.asp|agency=Tehelka|date=30 October 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115454/http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main7.asp?filename=Ne103004scame_charges.asp|archivedate=26 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been widespread allegations in the Hindi press that the certificates of the current secretary, K. Sreenivasa Rao, who completed his M.Phil and PhD degrees while being employed as Deputy Secretary (Administration) at the Sahitya Akademi without availing a single day's leave, are fake and fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thakur|first1=Sunderchand|title=साहित्य अकादमी में फिर विवादास्पद नियुक्ति|url=http://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1535663.cms|agency=Nav Bharat Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals by the writers community to the Ministry of Culture to launch an inquiry have not yielded any result.

=== Sahitya Akademi Awards controversy ===

It has been alleged time and again that the procedure of nomination of litterateurs for the coveted [[Sahitya Akademi Award]]s is not transparent. The ground-list of books (from which the jury members make two short-lists and the final selection for the award) is supposed to be made by the General Council. But the books are provided to this council by the bureaucrats and employees of the Akademi who are allegedly unqualified to make any kind of literary selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Y.P. Rajesh|first1=Amit Prakash,|title=The Literary Mafia|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/The-Literary-Mafia/200102|work=Outlook Magazine|date=1 Nov 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the award regulations makes the recommendations of the Language Advisory Board mandatory, the recommendations of the board are often dismissed and ignored by the officials without citing any reason. This lack of transparency and rigour in the selection process has resulted in a lot of controversy. It has even resulted in writers being forced to return the award when it has been proven that the selection procedure was fraudulent, as was the case with the Sahitya Akademi award for a translation into [[Oriya language|Oriya]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Probe sought into Sahitya Akademi affairs|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/probe-sought-into-sahitya-akademi-affairs/article728959.ece|work=The Hindu|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Writer's plan to return Sahitya Akademi award sparks row|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/writers-plan-to-return-sahitya-akademi-award-sparks-row/article581860.ece|work=The Hindu|date=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sahitya Akademi is also highly criticized by writers such as [[Khushwant Singh]] for ignoring eminent writers and awarding below-par writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Khushwant|title=Prize manipulators: Sahitya Akademi under fire for awarding 'below par' authors|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/controversy-over-the-1991-sahitya-akademis-choice-of-author-exposes-its-flawed-functioning/1/308420.html|work=India Today|date=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sub-standard literary works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mrunalini|first1=C|title=Draupadi’s unending circle of suffering|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/books/article225606.ece?service=print|work=The New Indian Express|date=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lulla|first1=Anil Budur|title=Disrobing Draupadi|url=http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/art-culture/disrobing-draupadi|work=Open Magazine|date=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiziano,_san_girolamo_penitente.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Saint Jerome in Penitence''''' or '''''Penitent Saint Jerome''''' is a c.1531 oil on canvas painting [[Titian]], now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris. It is first mentioned in the collections of [[Louis XIV]] and may have come from the [[Gonzaga collection]], perhaps making it the ''Saint Jerome'' mentioned in [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Federico Gonzaga]]'s correspondence, which can be dated to 1531. A second theory argues that the work was intended for Federico's mother [[Isabella d'Este]], who wanted a nocturnal scene.

The '''Salon''' ({{lang-fr|Salon}}), or rarely '''Paris Salon''' (French: ''Salon de Paris''), beginning in 1667&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Salon French art exhibition|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/Salon-French-art-exhibition|website=britannica.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the official [[art exhibition]] of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. Between 1748 and 1890 it was arguably the greatest annual or biennial art event in the Western world. At the 1761 Salon, thirty-three painters, nine sculptors, and eleven engravers contributed.&lt;ref name=Lev&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]. (1993) ''Painting and sculpture in France 1700–1789''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]], p. 3. {{ISBN|0300064942}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1881 onward, it has been managed by the [[Société des Artistes Français]].

== Origins ==
In 1667, the royally sanctioned French institution of art patronage, the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]]&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; (a division of the [[Académie des beaux-arts]]), held its first semi-public art exhibit at the Salon Carré. The Salon's original focus was the display of the work of recent graduates of the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], which was created by [[Cardinal Mazarin]], chief minister of France, in 1648. Exhibition at the Salon de Paris was essential for any artist to achieve success in France for at least the next 200 years. Exhibition in the Salon marked a sign of royal favor.

In 1725, the Salon was held in the [[Louvre|Palace of the Louvre]], when it became known as ''Salon'' or ''Salon de Paris''. In 1737, the exhibitions, held from 18 August 1737 to 5 September 1737 at the Grand Salon of the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref&gt;“Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800,” by Robert W. Berger, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; became public. They were held, at first, annually, and then biennially, in odd-numbered years. They would start on the feast day of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]] (25 August) and run for some weeks. Once made regular and public, the Salon's status was "never seriously in doubt" (Crow, 1987). In 1748 a [[jury]] of awarded artists was introduced. From this time forward, the influence of the Salon was undisputed.

== Prominence (1748–1890) ==
[[Image:Sargent MadameX.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|This portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]] of [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]] depicting her [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]] caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at the 1884 Salon.]]
The Salon exhibited paintings floor-to-ceiling and on every available inch of space. The jostling of artwork became the subject of many other paintings, including [[Pietro Antonio Martini]]'s ''Salon of 1785''. Printed catalogues of the Salons are primary documents for art historians. Critical descriptions of the exhibitions published in the [[gazette]]s mark the beginning of the modern occupation of [[art critic]].

The [[French revolution]] opened the exhibition to foreign artists. In the 19th century the idea of a public Salon extended to an annual government-sponsored juried exhibition of new painting and sculpture, held in large commercial halls, to which the ticket-bearing public was invited. The ''[[vernissage]]'' (varnishing) of opening night was a grand social occasion, and a crush that gave subject matter to newspaper caricaturists like [[Honoré Daumier]]. [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and others wrote reviews of the Salons.

The [[1848 revolution]] liberalized the ''Salon''. The amount of refused works was greatly reduced. In 1849 [[medal]]s were introduced.

=== Early splinter groups ===
The increasingly conservative and [[Academic art|academic]] juries were not receptive to the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painters,&lt;ref name=Impressionists&gt;{{cite web|title=The End of the Salon and the Rise of Impressionism|url=http://www.radford.edu/rbarris/art216upd2012/Impressionism.html|website=radford.edu|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose works were usually rejected, or poorly placed if accepted. The Salon opposed the Impressionists' shift away from traditional painting styles. In 1857&lt;ref&gt;The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism, page 59, by Ross King&lt;/ref&gt; the Salon jury turned away an unusually high number of the submitted paintings. An uproar resulted, particularly from regular exhibitors who had been rejected. In order to prove that the Salons were democratic, [[Napoleon III]] instituted the [[Salon des Refusés]], containing a selection of the works that the Salon had rejected that year. It opened on 17 May 1863, marking the birth of the [[avant-garde]]. The [[Impressionists]] held their own independent exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882 and 1886.

In 1881, the government withdrew official sponsorship from the annual Salon, and a group of artists organized the [[Société des Artistes Français]] to take responsibility for the show.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

== Secession ==
[[File:Salon des artistes français 1932.jpg|thumb|right|Salon of 1932, Grand Palais, Paris.]]
In December 1890, the leader of the ''Société des Artistes Français'', [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], propagated the idea that ''Salon'' should be an exhibition of young, not-yet awarded, artists. [[Ernest Meissonier]], [[Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Auguste Rodin]] and others rejected this proposal and made a secession. They created the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] and its own exhibition, immediately referred to in the press as the ''Salon du Champ de Mars'' &lt;ref&gt;Auguste Dalligny, 'Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts – l'Exposition du Champ de Mars', Journal des Arts, 16 May 1890&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux–Arts'';&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Bluysen]], 'Le Salon du Champ de Mars – IV, La République francaise, 23 June 1890&lt;/ref&gt; it was soon also widely known as the ''Nationale''.

In 1903, in response to what many artists at the time felt was a bureaucratic and conservative organization, a group of painters and sculptors led by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Auguste Rodin]] organized the [[Salon d'Automne]].

'''Tamra Davis''' (born January 22, 1962) is an American [[Film director|film]], [[Television director|television]] and [[music video director]].

==Early life==
Davis was born the second out of four children in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City, California]]. She was exposed to the media industry at an early age by her grandfather, a comedy writer, and her grandmother, who was an actress at Fox. Davis and her family constantly watched films and she aspired to become an actress. In the 11th grade, Davis dropped out of high school and met Egyptian film producer Ibrahim Moussa. Ibrahim took Davis to [[Italy]] for six months to work.

Returning to the U.S., Davis worked at an art gallery but soon quit to work at [[American Zoetrope]] in an apprentice position. The studio was struggling to complete [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s [[Waterloo in popular culture#Downfall|Waterloo]], ''[[One From the Heart]]''; the hectic schedule allowed Davis to study Coppola's directing and the business. Coppola suggested to Davis that she go to school, at which point she then attended [[Los Angeles City College]].&lt;ref name="McKenna"&gt;{{cite web|last=McKenna|first=Kristen|title=This Young MC Is a Movie Mixmaster Film: Tamra Davis combines her experience making cutting-edge videos with Hollywood's past to get the gritty `Guncrazy.'|url=https://login.ezp.pasadena.edu/login??url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/281814491?accountid=28371|publisher=Tribune Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
As soon as she got out of school, Davis sent out a package of videos that she had done and was hired to do a video for the band [[Hüsker Dü]]. Davis states that music videos "played a huge role in developing my sensibility as a director. There's much less sexism in the video world and they're open to women. But more important, with video you're always being pushed to experiment and come up with something new." &lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt; 
Over the past seven years, Tamra Davis has made a name for herself directing cutting-edge videos for some of the thorniest acts in popular music. As director of choice for performers such as [[N.W.A]], [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. Davis is also known for directing films such as ''[[Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child]]'', ''[[CB4]]'', ''[[Billy Madison]]'', and ''[[Half Baked]]'' and television shows such as ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'' and ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]''. She also directed the film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]'', starring [[Britney Spears]].

She also wrote a cookbook titled ''Make Me Something Good to Eat''.&lt;ref name="Cooking"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Davis has been married to [[Mike D]] of the [[Beastie Boys]] since 1993, but they are legally separated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/how-exbeastie-boy-mike-d-found-new-peace-in-malibu-w451725&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, Skyler and Davis.

==Critical reception==
Davis' debut feature film ''[[Guncrazy]]'' received a review saying that "in Guncrazy, Davis delivers pow entertainment with a twist: It matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacCambridge|first=Michael|title=Take a shot at `Guncrazy' // Movie may lead Drew Barrymore on comeback trail|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/256222213/13733B3F4F5372D07FB/12?accountid=28371}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Davis' co-worker [[Drew Barrymore]] praised her work ethic: "It's a real honor and much of the credit goes to Tamra because she's easily the best director I've ever worked with. Anyone who gets to work with her is lucky because the scope of her talent is huge and her vision is really pure." &lt;ref name="McKenna"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|auto=yes|date=February 2012}}

'''Twentieth-century theatre''' describes a period of great change within the [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[culture]] of the 20th century, mainly in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. There was a widespread challenge to long-established rules surrounding theatrical representation; resulting in the development of many new forms of theatre, including [[modernism]], [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionism]], [[Impressionism]], [[political theatre]] and other forms of [[Experimental theatre]], as well as the continuing development of already established theatrical forms like [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] and [[Realism (theatre)|realism]].

Throughout the century, the artistic reputation of theatre improved after being derided throughout the 19th century. However, the growth of other media, especially [[History of film|film]], has resulted in a diminished role within the culture at large. In light of this change, theatrical artists have been forced to seek new ways to engage with society. The various answers offered in response to this have prompted the transformations that make up its modern history.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Drain, Preface, ''Twentieth-Century Theatre: A Sourcebook," Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in areas like [[Gender studies|Gender theory]] and [[Postmodernism|postmodern philosophy]] identified and created subjects for the theatre to explore. These sometimes explicitly meta-theatrical performances were meant to confront the audience's perceptions and assumptions in order to raise questions about their society. These challenging and influential plays characterized much of the final two decades of the 20th-century.

Although largely developing in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] through the beginning of the century, the next 50 years saw an embrace of non-Western theatrical forms. Influenced by the dismantling of empires and the continuing development of [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial]] theory, many new artists utilized elements of their own [[culture]]s and [[Society|societies]] to create a diversified theatre.

==Realism==
[[File:MAT original company 1899.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The original company of the Moscow Art Theatre in 1899]]

Realism focuses on the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions or implausible, exotic and supernatural elements. For many theatre artists throughout the century, realism was meant to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life.

Influenced by the ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Charles Darwin]] and others, many artists began to find a [[psychological]] approach to theatre that emphasized the inner dimensions of the characters onstage. This was carried out both on the stage in [[acting]] styles, in [[Playwright|play writing]] and in [[Scenic design|theatrical design]]. Beginning with the work Russian playwrights [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Alexander Ostrovsky]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] and continued by [[Emile Zola]] in France and [[Henrik Ibsen]] in Norway in the late [[Nineteenth century theatre|19th Century]], realism came to dominate most of the theatrical culture of the 20th century in Britain and North America.

===Russia===

In Russia, the movement towards realism began earlier than anywhere else in the world. Building on the work of earlier pioneers, [[Constantin Stanislavski]] and [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] founded the [[Moscow Art Theatre]] in 1898, wanting to reform a Russian theatre dominated by [[melodrama]] to one in which high-quality art was available to the general public. In perhaps the most important theatrical meeting of the 20th century, the two met for an epic 18-hours, from 2 pm to 8 am the next morning, and laid the foundation for one of the most influential companies of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, Jean. 1991. The Moscow Art Theatre Letters. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they would forge a professional company with an ensemble ethos that discouraged individual vanity, selecting actors from Nemirovich's class at the Philharmonic school and Stanislavsky's amateur Society of Art and Literature group, along with other professional actors; they would create a realistic theatre of international renown, with popular prices for seats, whose organically [[Gesamtkunstwerk|unified aesthetic]] would bring together the techniques of the [[Meiningen Ensemble]] and those of [[André Antoine]]'s [[Théâtre Libre]] (which Stanislavsky had seen during trips to Paris).&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti (1989, 18) and (1999, 61–62)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1898, the theatre opened [[Anton Chekhov]]'s [[Moscow Art Theatre production of The Seagull|The Seagull]] with Stanislavski himself playing the role of Trigorin and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] as Treplev in "one of the greatest events in the history of Russian theatre and one of the greatest developments in the history of world drama."&lt;ref&gt;Rudnitsky (1981, 8) and Benedetti (1999, 85)&lt;/ref&gt; Nemirovich described the applause, which came after a prolonged silence, as bursting from the audience like a [[dam]] breaking and the production received unanimous praise from the press.&lt;ref name="b86"&gt;Benedetti (1999, 86).&lt;/ref&gt; Later analysts attribute the production's success to the fidelity of its delicate representation of everyday life, its intimate, ensemble playing, and the resonance of its mood of despondent uncertainty with the psychological disposition of the Russian intelligentsia of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Braun (1981, 64).&lt;/ref&gt; Productions of Ibsen, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and Chekhov's [[Uncle Vanya]], [[The Cherry Orchard]] and [[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]] were also very successful in the early days of the company.

After the success of the Moscow Art Theatre, Stanislavski set out to create a [[Stanislavski's system|unified system of acting]] that would train actors and actresses to create believable characterizations for their performances. Developed mainly between 1911 and 1916 and revised throughout his life, the approach was partly based on the concept of emotional memory for which an actor focuses internally to portray a character's emotions onstage. Areas of study include concentration, voice, physical skills, emotion memory, observation, and dramatic analysis. The Stanislavsky system was widely practiced in the Soviet Union and in the United States, where experiments in its use began in the 1920s and continued in many schools and professional workshops.

In the early part of the 20th century, Russia experienced a cultural [[Russian literature#Silver Age|Silver Age]] and the theatre was no exception. By 1916, the total number of producing theatres in Moscow alone totaled close to 200. These year-round and seasonal theatres produced mainly farces, comedies, vaudevilles and even melodramas, but there were also a significant number of theatres offering realistic or [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] theatre. These included [[Aleksey Suvorin]]'s [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]] and the Moscow Dramatic Theatre (1914–19). While there were a number of actress-managers in [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] like [[Vera Komissarzhevskaya]] and [[Ida Rubinstein]], the course of Russian theatre in the Silver Age was largely dominated by men.&lt;ref&gt;Golub, 278-282.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First World War]] and the [[Russian Revolution]], many theatre artists left Russia for other countries, including [[Georges Pitoëff]] to France, [[Theodore Komisarjevsky]] to Britain, and, famously, [[Michael Chekhov|Mikhael Chekhov]] to the United States, exporting the Stanislavski system and contributing to the development of a 'director's theatre' in the post-war world.&lt;ref&gt;Esslin, 379&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eugene O'Neill 1936.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eugene O'Neill]] had a huge influence on the development of modern American drama.]]

===United States===

In the United States, [[William Vaughn Moody]]'s plays ''The Great Divide'' (1906) and ''The Faith Healer'' (1909) pointed the way to a more realistic American drama in their emphasis on the emotional conflicts that lie at the heart of contemporary social conflicts. Other key playwrights signaling the move to realism in the beginning of the century include [[Edward Sheldon]], [[Charles Rann Kennedy]] and [[Rachel Crothers]]. Onstage, the American theatre was dominated by the [[Barrymore family]]: [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[Ethel Barrymore]] (the "First Lady of American Theater") and [[John Barrymore]] ("... the most influential and idolized actor of his day."). They were so popular that a play was even written about them: [[The Royal Family (play)|The Royal Family]] by [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Edna Ferber]], a parody of the Barrymores, with particular aim taken at John and Ethel Barrymore.

Through the early century, no American dramatist had as much influence on the development of drama as [[Eugene O'Neill]]. Born into the theatre from a young age, he spent much of his youth on trains and backstage at theatres, before developing his talent with the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. Between 1916 and 1920, he wrote several plays for the company before debuting his first critical hit ''[[Beyond the Horizon (play)|Beyond the Horizon]]'' in 1920, which went on to win the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]]. He followed that with critical and commercial successes, including ''[[The Emperor Jones]]'', ''[[Anna Christie]]'' (Pulitzer Prize 1922), ''[[Desire Under the Elms]]'' (1924), ''[[Strange Interlude]]'' (Pulitzer Prize 1928), ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1931), ''[[The Iceman Cometh]]'' (1939) and his only well-known comedy, ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]''. After his death, his magnum opus and masterwork ''[[Long Day's Journey into Night]]'' was published and is often regarded to be one of the finest American plays of the 20th century.

The economic crisis of the [[Great Depression]] led to the creation of the [[Federal Theatre Project]] (1935–39), a [[New Deal]] program which funded theatre and other live artistic performances throughout the country. National director [[Hallie Flanagan]] shaped the project into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and made it possible for millions of Americans to see theatre for the first time. The project directly employed 15,000 men and women and played 1,200 productions to nearly 30 million people in 200 theatres nationwide, with 65% being presented free of charge, at a total cost of $46 million.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |authorlink=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |url= |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key figures of the early century include [[George S. Kaufman]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[S. N. Behrman]], [[Sidney Howard]], [[Robert E. Sherwood]], and a set of playwrights who followed O'Neill's path of philosophical searching, [[Philip Barry]], [[Thornton Wilder]] and [[William Saroyan]].

==Modernism==
Modernism was a predominantly European movement that developed as a self-conscious break from traditional art forms. It represents a significant shift in cultural sensibilities, often attributed to the fallout of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Modris Ekstein, ''Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age,'' Lester &amp; Orpen Dennys, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the modernist theatre was in large part an attempt to realize the reformed stage on [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] principles as advocated by [[Émile Zola]] in the 1880s. However, a simultaneous reaction against naturalism urged the theatre in a much different direction. Owing much to [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], the movement attempted to integrate poetry, painting, music, and dance in a harmonious fusion. Both of these seemingly conflicting movements fit under the term 'Modernism'.&lt;ref&gt;Drain 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theatre==
[[File:Augusto Boal nyc5.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A workshop of [[Augusto Boal]]'s [[Theatre of the Oppressed]] in 2008.]]
Political theatre is an attempt to rethink the nature and function of theatre in the light of the dynamics of the society outside it and audience involvement within it. It led to profound and original theories of [[acting]], staging and [[Playwright|playwriting]].&lt;ref&gt;Drain 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular theatre==
At the beginning of the 20th century, many viewed theatre as an "all-too-popular affair."&lt;ref&gt;Drain 153&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the true reformers of the early part of the century called for increasingly smaller theatres, where their techniques could register on a select audience. Still, these same practitioners often dreamed that their art would be a true people's theatre: a theatre for the people. Inspired by an understanding of the [[Greek theatre]] and heavily influenced by [[Nietzsche]], they sought a profound or ecstatic ritual event that involved music and movement, in a space without a [[proscenium arch]]. Later, practitioners like [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] would initiate an attempt to bridge the "gulf" between modernism and the people.&lt;ref&gt;Drain 156-157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical theatre===

In popular [[musical theatre]] there have been different trends and phases of commercial success, including works of the following:

* the great popularity of the British [[Edwardian musical comedies]] (1892-1917),
* the advent of the  [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals in New York (1913-1923),
* the emergence of American popular [[musical theatre]], with the works of:
**[[Jerome Kern]] (1885-1945); [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals, ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]] (1916, 1917), ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927)
** [[George Gershwin]] (1898-1937) and [[Ira Gershwin]] (1896-1983) ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924), ''[[An American in Paris]]'' (1928), ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935).
**[[Cole Porter]] (1891-1964); [[Paris (1928 musical)|''Paris'']] (1928), ''[[Wake Up and Dream]]'' (1929), ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934)
**[[Rodgers and Hart]]; [[Richard Rodgers]] (1902-1979) and [[Lorenz Hart]] (1895-1943) ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940)
**[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]; [[Richard Rodgers]] (1902-1979) and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] (1895 &amp;ndash; 1960):''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959).
*In the second half of the 20th century, new creative talents emerged and attracted large audiences, including:
** [[Stephen Sondheim]] (1930--); ''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957) (lyrics), ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1962), ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973), ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (1979), ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987).
** [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] (1948--); ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' (1978), ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' (1981), [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]] (1986)
**[[Claude-Michel Schönberg]] (1944--) and [[Alain Boublil]] (1941--); ''[[Les Misérables (musical)]]'' (1980), and ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' (1989)

==Post-modern theatre==
Post-modern theatre is a recent phenomenon in world theatre, coming as it does out of the [[postmodern philosophy]] that originated in Europe in the middle of the 20th century. Post-modern theatre emerged as a reaction against modernist theatre. Most post-modern productions are centered around highlighting the fallibility of definite truth, instead encouraging the audience to reach their own individual understanding. Essentially, thus, post-modern theatre raises questions rather than attempting to supply answers.

==Global theatre==
At the beginning of the 20th-century, many European audiences were exposed to the "exotic" theatrical world of [[Japanese theatre|Japanese]] and [[Chinese theatre|Chinese]] performances. This led to many Western practitioners interpreting and incorporating these styles into their own theatres: most notably [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s adaptation of [[Chinese opera]] to support his 'Alienation' effect. The influence of the non-western theatre on theatrical culture in the 20th-century has often been crucial to new developments. However, the period during and after the advent of [[Post-colonialism|post-colonial]] theory in the 1960s and 1970s, has led to a tremendous amount of development in theatre practice all over the world. This has created, for the first time, a truly global theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Drain 293&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant figures==
Significant figures and some landmark theories and movements of the period include:
* [[Constantin Stanislavski]] (1863-1938) and his [[Stanislavski's system|system]]: a "naturalistic" method of drawing on the actor's own emotional memories to convey a character's thoughts and emotions
* [[Antonin Artaud]] (1896-1948) and the [[Theatre of Cruelty]]: a plan to force the audience to shed their illusions
* [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1898-1956) and [[Epic theatre]]: a reaction against Stanislavski's naturalistic method, Epic theatre makes clear that the audience is watching a play and an artifice
* [[Lee Strasberg]] (1901-1982) and [[Method acting]]: which trains actors to draw upon their own emotions and memories, to convincingly portray a part.
* [[Jerzy Grotowski]] (1933–1999), who introduced the concept of "poor theatre"
* [[Eugenio Barba]], Grotowski's disciple and founder of the [[Odin Theatret]], introducing the concepts of theatrical anthropology
* [[Samuel Beckett]] (1906-1989) and [[Theatre of the Absurd]]: in a modern world without meaning or purpose, a play's dialog, plot and characters give up the threads of "logic" or "message".  (related to [[Existentialism]])
* [[Hans-Thies Lehmann]]'s theory of [[Postdramatic theatre]]: focused more on effect on the audience than on the original text.

===Nobel laureates===
During the twentieth-century the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] was awarded to the following who were primarily [[Playwright|dramatist]]s:

* 1904 - [[José Echegaray]] — Spanish; ''El gran Galeoto''
* 1910 - [[Paul Heyse]] — German

* 1936 - [[Eugene O'Neill]] — American
* 1969 - [[Samuel Beckett]] — Irish
* 1986 - [[Wole Soyinka]] — Nigerian
* 1997 - [[Dario Fo]] — Italian

'''Wistman's Wood''' is one of only three remote high-altitude oakwoods on [[Dartmoor]], [[Devon]], [[England]]. (The other two are Black Tor Beare on the [[West Okement]] at SX565892 and Piles Copse on the [[River Erme]] at SX644620.)

==Geography==
It lies at an altitude of 380–410 metres in the valley of the [[West Dart]] River near [[Two Bridges, Devon|Two Bridges]], &lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/654b7294-0f84-11e5-b968-00144feabdc0.html |title=Twisted oaks and tales on the trail of Devon's pygmy forest |last=Wilson |first=Matthew |newspaper=Financial Times |date=19 June 2015 |accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at grid reference SX612774.

The source of the [[Devonport Leat]], at a weir on the West Dart River, is just north of the wood.

==Preservation status==
This is one of the highest oakwoods in Britain and, as an outstanding example of native upland oak woodland, was selected as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="sssi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1001201|title=Natural England - SSSIs : SSSI information|publisher=www.english-nature.org.uk|accessdate=2008-10-13}} Choose "View citation" to access the citation (pdf file).&lt;/ref&gt; It is also an [[A Nature Conservation Review|NCR site]] and forms part of the Wistman’s Wood [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|National Nature Reserve]]. The wood was also one of the primary reasons for selection of the Dartmoor [[Special Area of Conservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dartmoor SAC web page http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0012929&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The wood is split into three main blocks (North, Middle and South Groves or Woods), which in total cover about 3.5 ha (9 acres).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; These occupy sheltered, south-west facing slopes, where a bank of large granite boulders ("clitter") is exposed, and pockets of acid, free-draining, brown earth soils have accumulated. It is owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; and has been managed since 1961 under a nature reserve agreement with the [[Nature Conservancy Council]], [[English Nature]] and [[Natural England]]. There is no active management, but many people visit the site on foot (mostly accessing the southern end of South Wood), and cattle and sheep have free access where the terrain permits, outside of a small fenced exclosure in South Wood.

===Flora===
The vegetation conforms mostly to W17a ''Quercus petraea-Betula pubescens-Dicranum majus'' woodland, ''Isothecium myosuroides-Diplophyllum albicans'' sub-community in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]]. The trees are mainly [[pedunculate oak]], with occasional [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]], and a very few [[Ilex aquifolium|holly]], [[Crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], and [[Salix aurita|eared-willow]]. Tree branches are characteristically festooned with a variety of [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] mosses and lichens and, sometimes, by grazing-sensitive species such as [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]] and [[Polypodium vulgare|polypody]]. On the ground, boulders are usually covered by lichens and mossy patches – frequent species include ''Dicranum scoparium'', ''Hypotrachyna laevigata'', ''Rhytidiadelphus loreus'' and ''Sphaerophorus globosus'' – and, where soil has accumulated, patches of acid grassland grow with [[Galium saxatile|heath bedstraw]], [[Potentilla erecta|tormentil]] and [[Rumex acetosa|sorrel]]. In places protected from livestock, grazing-sensitive plants such as [[Oxalis acetosella|wood sorrel]], [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]], [[Luzula sylvatica|wood rush]] and [[Rubus fruticosus|bramble]] occur. A fringe of [[Pteridium aquilinum|bracken]] surrounds much of the wood, demarcating the extent of brown earth soils.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; The wood supports approximately 120 species of lichen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hoare |first1=Ben |title=Wild Month |work=BBC Wildlife |date=November 2018 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fauna===
The wood is home to a large population of [[Vipera berus|adders]].&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==History==
Wistman's Wood has been mentioned in writing for hundreds of years. It is likely a left-over from the ancient forest that covered much of Dartmoor c. 7000 BC, before [[Mesolithic]] hunter/gatherers cleared it around 5000 BC.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; Photographic and other records show that Wistman's Wood has changed considerably since the mid-19th century; at the same time climatic conditions have also generally become warmer.&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, M.C.F., Spooner, G.M. and Spooner, M. 1980. Changes in Wistman’s Wood, Devon: photographic and other evidence. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 112, Pages 43-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mountford"&gt;Mountford, E,P., Backmeroff, C.E. and Peterken, G.F. 2001. Long-term patterns of growth, mortality, regeneration and natural disturbance in Wistman’s Wood, a high altitude oakwood on Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 133, Pages 231-262.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only have the older oak trees grown from a stunted/semi-prostrate to a more ascending form, but a new generation of mostly straight-grown and single-stemmed oaks has developed. The oldest oaks appear to be 400–500 years old, and originated within a degenerating oakwood that survived in scrub form during two centuries of cold climate.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; In c. 1620 these old trees were described as "no taller than a man may touch to top with his head". Tree height increased somewhat by the mid-19th century, and during the 20th century approximately doubled (in 1997 the maximum and average height of trees was around 12 m and 7 m respectively).&lt;ref name="Mountford"/&gt; In addition, a wave of marginal new oaks arose after c. 1900, roughly doubling the area of wood. Part of the evidence for these changes comes from a permanent vegetation plot located in the southern end of South Wood. This is the oldest known of its kind in British woodland, with a small part having been recorded by Hansford Worth in 1921.&lt;ref name="Christy"&gt;Christy, M. and Worth, R.H. 1922. The ancient dwarfed oak woods of Dartmoor. Transactions of the Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science Volume 54, Pages 291-342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Buller Stone'', a boulder to the east of the wood, commemorates an attempt in 1866 to date the trees, when Wentworth Buller (with permission from the Duchy) felled an oak. It was estimated to be 168 years old.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

==Myths, art and literature==
The wood has been the inspiration for numerous artists, poets, photographers and appears in hundreds of nineteenth century accounts. One tradition holds that it was planted by [[Isabella de Forz, Countess of Devon|Isabella de Fortibus]] (1237-93).&lt;ref name=FT/&gt; 

The wood is described in detail and discussed as a point of great interest in ''The Tree'', a 1978 essay on naturalism by English novelist [[John Fowles]].

The name of Wistman's Wood may derive from the dialect word 'wisht' meaning 'eerie/uncanny',&lt;ref name="Westwood2"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books, London. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. P. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘pixie-led/haunted’.&lt;ref name="hemery"&gt;{{cite book |title=High Dartmoor |author=Eric Hemery |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |year=1983 |pages=454–455 |isbn=0-7091-8859-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legendary [[Wild Hunt]] in Devon is particularly associated with Wistman's Wood – the [[hellhound]]s of which are known as Yeth (Heath) or Wisht Hounds in the Devonshire dialect.&lt;ref name="Westwood"&gt;Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion.

'''Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow''' (Traceability is Credibility) is an ongoing [[conceptual art]] work created by [[Bryan McCormack]], encompassing performance, [[social media]] installation art and drawings, on the subject of the [[European migrant crisis|European refugee crisis]].

== Development ==

[[File:Refugee Drawing Yesterday.jpg|thumb|''Yesterday'' drawing by an 18 year old Syrian boy currently living in Kara Tepe Refugee Camp, Lesbos Island, Greece]]

Throughout 2016 and part of 2017, McCormack visited squats and [[Syrian refugee camps|refugee camps]] across Europe. At each location he worked with refugees, asking them to produce three drawings: one of their life before (Yesterday), one of their current life (Today) and one of their life imagined in the future (Tomorrow). The results of these drawings have been shared through the project's social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.villamedici.it/fr/programme.../les...villa/.../les-jeudis-de-la-villa-3-novembre|title=www.villamedici.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adnkronos.com/.../ruolo-dell-arte-contemporanea-nella-crisi|title=www.adnkronos.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artemagazine.it/.../2721-roma-villa-medici-gli-appuntamenti|title=www.artemagazine.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gossip.libero.it/search/bryan-mccormack|title=gossip.libero.it|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artribune.com/artista-mostre-biografia/bryan-mccormack/|title=www.artribune.com|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==

Several hundred of these refugee drawings along with video performance studies inspired by the drawings will be part of a multidisciplinary installation created by McCormack at the Fondazione Giorgio Cini during the 2017 [[Venice Biennale]]. This installation is in conjunction with a performance, curated by the artist and Dr. Henry Bell, with over forty students from [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exibart.com/notizia.asp?IDNotizia=51263&amp;IDCategoria=204|title=COME PUÒ AGIRE L’ARTE CONTEMPORANEA NELLA CRISI EUROPEA DEI RIFUGIATI?
