      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8420">'''Adriano B. Lucatelli''' (born 23 February 1966) is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[entrepreneur]] in the financial services industry.

== Life ==
Adriano Lucatelli was born on 23 February 1966 in [[Uster]] near Zurich, Switzerland. His father’s family originated from [[Apulia]] in [[Southern Italy]], and worked primarily in agriculture and the [[textile industry]]. His mother’s family comes from [[Central Switzerland]]. His great-grandfather was the entrepreneur and pioneer in electricity Zeno Durrer, and his great uncle was [[Ludwig von Moos]], a member of the Swiss federal government (the [[Swiss Federal Council]]).

== Education and career ==
Lucatelli studied [[International relations|international affairs]] and [[economics]] at the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]]) and at the [[London School of Economics]] ([[Master of Science|MSc]]). In 1995 he obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[University of Zurich]] with a dissertation on global financial market regulation. Parallel to his career he has also completed an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] program at the [[University of Rochester]] ([[New York (state)|N.Y.]]), and an advanced management program at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School]].

He is a co-founder and CEO of Descartes Finance AG, a Swiss [[robo-advisor]], and Chairman of Additiv AG, a Swiss banking and insurance software provider.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlSCUMTHDFs ''Digitalisierung im Banking.''] ''finews.ch tv'', 4 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the Swiss business magazine “Bilanz” chose him among the top 100 Swiss bankers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://descartes-finance.com/media/news/Lucatelli_Bilanz_TopBanker_2017.pdf ''Die 100 Top-Banker der Schweiz''] Bilanz 10/2017, pp. 54, 27 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2012 to 2018, he lectured at the [[University of Zurich]] on the [[political economy]] of [[international finance]].

He started his career in 1994 at [[Credit Suisse]], where he held various managerial positions in [[Zurich]] and [[London]]. From 2002 to 2009 Lucatelli was managing director and member of the management committee at [[UBS]] Switzerland in [[Lugano]] and Zurich. He then co-founded Swiss financial services group Reuss Private Group, and between 2009 and 2013 headed securities dealer and investment firm Reuss Private AG&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finews.ch/news/banken/11674-reuss-private-vermoegensverwaltung/ ''Führungswechsel bei Reuss Private.''] ''finews.ch'', 23 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as its CEO.

== Publications and commentaries ==
In the course of his career Lucatelli has published various articles in newspapers and journals, and has authored the books Finance and World Order (1997),&lt;ref&gt;''Finance and world order: financial fragility, systemic risk, and transnational regimes.'' Greenwood Press, Westport, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30378-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Off-Target Corporate Governance (2013),&lt;ref&gt;''Off-Target Corporate Governance or How Not to Throw Good Money after Bad.'' Versus Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-03909-155-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Fine Art of Efficient Investing (2015).&lt;ref&gt;''The Fine Art of Efficient Investing or How to Make Sure You Sleep Better at Night.'' Versus Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-03909-195-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, he co-authored with Lucienne C. Vaudan “Eine kurze Reise durch die Finanzmärkte.”&lt;ref&gt;''Eine kurze Reise durch die Finanzmärkte.'' Versus Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-03909-265-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also writes guest commentaries for publication in the German online magazine stern.de, the Swiss finance portal finews.ch, the Swiss business portal moneycab.com and the ETF-platform 10x10.ch. In terms of [[Klout]] score, Lucatelli has been one of the five most influential Swiss economists on social media from 2015 to 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://ranking.influencer.world/en/set/economists ''Klout Ranking der Schweizer Ökonomen'', 3 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investment expertise ==
Lucatelli is a well-known financial expert. Before the [[dot-com bubble|dotcom crash]] in July 2000 he warned that the majority of the new internet firms would disappear,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merlinifinance.com/fileadmin/docs/BAZ_20000722.pdf ''Börse: «Irrationaler Überschwang».''] ''Basler Zeitung'', 22/23 July 2000, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and in August 2011, at the peak of the [[European debt crisis|euro crisis]], he recommended that investors progressively get back into equities and steer clear of overpriced gold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/startseite/ruhe-bewahren-1.11899325 ''«Ruhe bewahren» – Sieben Fragen an Adriano Lucatelli.''] ''NZZ am Sonntag'', 14 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated his buy recommendation in March 2014, setting a target of 3,000 index points for the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] by mid-2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merlinifinance.com/fileadmin/docs/20140315_Bull_Rally_MF_E.pdf ''Stock markets: growth in sight?''] ''merlini finance'', Kilchberg, 14 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Added to this Lucatelli, in collaboration with [[Ernst Fehr]], was the first to calculate the [[Market-Adjusted Performance Indicator]] (MAPI) for listed Swiss companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finews.com/news/english-news/22118-adriano-b-lucatelli-ernst-fehr-mapi ''Adriano B. Lucatelli: Share Price Doesn't Tell the Whole Truth''] ''finews.ch'', 26 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The indicator shows that good management systematically creates value for shareholders, reflected in the fact that shares of these companies outperform the broad [[Swiss Performance Index]] (SPI), in some cases by a considerable margin. 

Lucatelli is also one of the first critics of [[Bitcoin]]. He warned early about the uncontrolled speculation with the [[cryptocurrency]].

== Awards &amp; recognition ==
In 2011 he earned the Distinguished Alumni Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unr.edu/alumni/Gala.aspx ''Distinguished Alumni Award Recipients.'']{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''unr.edu''&lt;/ref&gt; from the College of [[Liberal arts education|Liberal Arts]] at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]]. The same year he was nominated by Ernst &amp; Young Switzerland for the [[Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award|Entrepreneur of the Year award]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.versus.ch/shop/d/scripts/detail.cfm?art_nr=307&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extraprofessional activities ==
Outside work, since 2009 Lucatelli has served as chairman of the readers’ commission of the [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]] newspaper, and he funds two [[scholarship]]s giving financial support to students at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://system.nevada.edu/tasks/sites/Nshe/assets/File/BoardOfRegents/Agendas/2012/nov-mtgs/foundations/unr/UNR-2.pdf ''University of Nevada, Reno Foundation. Annual Report to the NSHE Board of Regents.''] ''unr.edu'' 30 November 2012, p. 16 (PDF, 2,7&amp;nbsp;MB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unr.edu/silverandblue/archive/2006/fall/NevadaKnow-How.pdf ''Young Nevada alumnus promotes international affairs education.''] ''unr.edu'' Archive 2006, p. 16 (PDF, 400&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unr.edu/silverandblue/archive/2011/fall/NSB%20Fall%202011_40-45.pdf ''Nevada Silver &amp; Blue, Fall 2011.''] ''unr.edu'' Fall 2011, p. 45 (PDF, 429&amp;nbsp;kB)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucatelli is a life member of the Cantonal Art Museum in [[Lugano]], an honorary member of [[Pi Sigma Alpha]] (the National Political Science Honor Society), and a member of the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]] in [[London]].

***** EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: *****

The question of nationality is a contentious one in that Alexander Graham Bell has been variously claimed as Scottish, British, American, and Canadian. Bell made a number of inventions as a formal British citizen after immigrating to Canada and then moving to the United States, including the telephone in 1876; however, he did not become an American citizen until 1882. Therefore, if nationality is to be described specifically ... Alexander Graham Bell, British inventor of the telephone, died as an American citizen in Canada. The wording in the lead paragraph was carefully crafted after input from many editors to accommodate the many diverse claims. It is recognized that in the last years of his life, Bell had American citizenship, although he lived primarily in Canada on his estate. His life's work and details on his nationality and citizenship are provided in later sections. Please discuss any potentially divisive submissions prior to editing the introductory section.

'''Alexander Graham Bell''' (March 3, 1847&amp;nbsp;– August 2, 1922)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bellhomestead.ca/history/Pages/TheBellFamily.aspx |title=The Bell Family |website=Bell Homestead National Historic Site |access-date=September 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a &lt;!-- Read note above prior to modifying this introduction --&gt; [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-born{{refn|Bell was a British citizen for most of his early life. When he moved to Canada in 1870, Canadian and British citizenship were functionally identical, with [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizenship]] only becoming a formal classification in 1910. He applied for American citizenship after 1877, gained it in 1882, and referred to himself as an American citizen from that point on. Quote from Bell speaking to his wife: "you are a citizen because you can't help it – you were born one, but I chose to be one."{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=228}} Aside from Bell's own view of his citizenship, many, if not most Canadians considered him also as one of theirs as evidenced in an address by the Governor General of Canada. On October 24, 1917, in Brantford, Ontario, the Governor General spoke at the unveiling of the [[Bell Telephone Memorial]] to an audience numbering in the thousands, saying: "Dr. Bell is to be congratulated upon being able to receive the recognition of his fellow citizens and fellow countrymen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reville |first=F.

He also founded the [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&amp;T) in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 291.{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pizer 2009, pp. 120–124. Bruce 1990, p. 291{{Full citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell's father, grandfather, and brother had all been associated with work on [[elocution]] and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf, profoundly influencing Bell's life's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Robert V. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmR0MOQAu0UC |title=Bell: Alexander Bell and the Conquest of Solitude |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Cornell University Press |date=1990 |p=419 |isbn=978-0-8014-9691-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; His research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] for the telephone in 1876.{{refn|From {{harvp|Black|1997|p=18}}: "He thought he could harness the new [[Electronics|electronic technology]] by creating a machine with a transmitter and receiver that would send sounds telegraphically to help people hear."|group=N}} Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacLeod |first=Elizabeth |title=Alexander Graham Bell: An Inventive Life |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher=Kids Can Press |date=1999 |p=19 |isbn=978-1-55074-456-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|After Bell's death his wife Mabel wrote to [[John J. Carty]], an AT&amp;T vice-president, and commented on her husband's reluctance to have a phone in his study, saying "[of the statements in the newspapers] ...publishing of Mr. Bell's dislike of the telephone. Of course, he never had one in his study. That was where he went when he wanted to be alone with his thoughts and his work. The telephone, of course, means intrusion by the outside world. And the little difficulties and delays often attending the establishment of conversation... did irritate him, so that as a rule he preferred having others send and receive messages. But all really important business over the telephone he transacted himself. There are few private houses more completely equipped with telephones than ours... and there was nothing that Mr. Bell was more particular about than our telephone service... We never could have come here [to Beinn Bhreagh] in the first place or continued here, but for the telephone which kept us in close touch with doctors and neighbors and the regular telegraph office... Mr. Bell did like to say in fun, "Why did I ever invent the Telephone," but no one had a higher appreciation of its indispensableness or used it more freely when need was—either personally or by deputy —and he was really tremendously proud of it and all it was accomplishing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=Mabel |title=Dr. Bell's Appreciation of the Telephone Service |journal=Bell Telephone Quarterly |volume=1 |issue=3 |date=October 1922 |p=65 |url=https://archive.org/stream/belltelephonemag01amer#page/64/mode/2up |access-date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}}

Many other inventions marked Bell's later life, including groundbreaking work in [[Free-space optical communication|optical telecommunications]], [[hydrofoil]]s, and [[aeronautics]].

===First invention===
As a child, young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age. His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbour whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays. Young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill. He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=16}} In return, Ben's father John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to "invent".{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=16}}

From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry, and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he revelled in mimicry and "voice tricks" akin to [[ventriloquism]] that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12), and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=9}} He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mackay |first=James |title=Sounds Out of Silence: A life of Alexander Graham Bell |location=Edinburgh, UK |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |date=1997 |p=25 |isbn=978-1-85158-833-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study [[acoustics]].

His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his ''The Standard Elocutionist'' (1860),{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=8}} which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. ''The Standard Elocutionist'' appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct [[deaf-mute]]s (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Bell's father taught him and his brothers not only to write [[Visible Speech]] but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=7}} Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including [[Latin]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and even [[Sanskrit]], accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=7}}

===Education===
As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, he was enrolled at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at the age of 15, having completed only the first four forms.{{sfn|Mackay|1997|p=31}} His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=11}} Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Town |first=Florida |title=Alexander Graham Bell |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher=Grolier |date=1988 |p=7 |isbn=978-0-7172-1950-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 16, Bell secured a position as a "pupil-teacher" of [[elocution]] and music, in Weston House Academy at [[Elgin, Moray]], Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=37}} The following year, he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]]; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to [[University College London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shulman |first=Seth |title=The Telephone Gambit: Chasing Alexander Bell's Secret |location=New York |publisher=Norton &amp; Company |date=2008 |p=49 |isbn=978-0-393-06206-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First experiments with sound===
His father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique [[automaton]] developed by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] based on the earlier work of [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen]].{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} The rudimentary "mechanical man" simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} While his brother constructed the throat and [[larynx]], Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could "speak", albeit only a few words.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=25}} The boys would carefully adjust the "lips" and when a [[bellows]] forced air through the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]], a very recognizable "Mama" ensued, to the delight of neighbours who came to see the Bell invention.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|pp=7–9}}

Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's [[Skye Terrier]], "Trouve".{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=9}} After he taught it to growl continuously, Bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and [[vocal cords]] to produce a crude-sounding "Ow ah oo ga ma ma". With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate "How are you, grandma?" Indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a "talking dog".{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=30}} These initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using [[tuning fork]]s to explore [[resonance]].

At age 19, Bell wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'').{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=30}} Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Bell a copy of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s work, ''The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music''.{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=46}}

Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork "contraption", Bell pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition,&lt;ref name="DCB" /&gt; Bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: "Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech." He also later remarked: "I thought that Helmholtz had done it&amp;nbsp;... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder&amp;nbsp;... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacKenzie |first=Catherine |author-link=Catherine MacKenzie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFOcw4lN_ZYC |title=Alexander Graham Bell |location=Boston, Massachusetts |publisher=Grosset and Dunlap |date=2003 |orig-year=1928 |p=41 |isbn=978-0-7661-4385-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=31}}{{sfn|Shulman|2008|pp=46–48}}{{refn| Helmholtz's ''The Sensations of Tone'' is credited with inspiring Bell, at the age of 23, to further his studies of electricity and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name="DCB" /&gt;|group=N}}

===Family tragedy===
In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Micklos |first=John Jr. |title=Alexander Graham Bell: Inventor of the Telephone |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |date=2006 |p=8 |isbn=978-0-06-057618-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a [[telegraph]] wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=45}} Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward "Ted," was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as "A. G. Bell") and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at [[University College London]], Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.

Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in [[South Kensington]], London. His first two pupils were [[deaf-mute]] girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property,{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=67–28}}{{refn|The family pet was given to his brother's family.|group=N}} conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp),{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=68}} and join his father and mother in setting out for the "[[New World]]". Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=33}}

In 1870, aged 23, Bell, together with Bell's brother's widow, Caroline Margaret Ottaway,{{sfn|Mackay|1997|p=50}} and his parents travelled on the SS ''Nestorian'' to Canada.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=10}} After landing at [[Quebec City]], the Bells transferred to another steamer to [[Montreal]] and then boarded a train to [[Paris, Ontario]],{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=21}} to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson, a family friend. After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a farm of {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near [[Brantford]], Ontario. The property consisted of an orchard, large farmhouse, stable, pigsty, hen-house, and a [[carriage house]], which bordered the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]].{{sfn|Mackay|1997|p=61}}{{refn| The estate, dating from 1858, is in the present day located at 94 Tutela Heights Road, Brantford, and is now known as the "Bell Homestead", and formally as the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site|Bell Homestead National Historic Site of Canada]].

At the homestead, Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his "dreaming place",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wing |first=Chris |title=Alexander Graham Bell at Baddeck |location=Baddeck, Nova Scotia |publisher=Christopher King |date=1980 |p=10|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=34}} Despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada, Bell found the climate and environs to his liking, and rapidly improved.{{sfn|Mackay|1997|p=62}}{{refn| Bell would later write that he had come to Canada a "dying man".|group=N}} He continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the [[Six Nations 40, Ontario|Six Nations Reserve]] across the river at [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]], he learned the [[Mohawk language]] and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Visible Speech symbols. For his work, Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donned a [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] headdress and danced traditional dances.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=35}}{{refn|Bell was thrilled at his recognition by the Six Nations Reserve and throughout his life would launch into a Mohawk war dance when he was excited.|group=N}}

After setting up his workshop, Bell continued experiments based on Helmholtz's work with electricity and sound.{{Sfn|Wing|1980|p=10}} He also modified a [[Pump organ|melodeon]] (a type of pump organ) so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance.&lt;ref name="Waldi-undated"&gt;{{cite news |last=Waldie |first=Jean H. |title=Historic Melodeon Is Given To Bell Museum |publisher=likely published either by the ''[[London Free Press]]'' or by the ''[[Brantford Expositor]]'', date unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the family was settled in, both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871, he accompanied his father to Montreal, where Melville was offered a position to teach his System of Visible Speech.

==Work with the deaf==

Bell's father was invited by [[Sarah Fuller]], principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public [[Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing|Horace Mann School for the Deaf]]),{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=74}} in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post in favour of his son. Travelling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors.{{sfn|Town|1988|p=12}} He was subsequently asked to repeat the programme at the [[American School for the Deaf|American Asylum for Deaf-mutes]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the [[Clarke School for the Deaf]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].

Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his "harmonic telegraph".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alexander Graham Bell |type=(booklet) |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia |publisher=Maritime Telegraph &amp; Telephone Limited |date=1979 |p=8 |ref={{sfnRef|''Alexander Graham Bell''|1979}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In later years, Bell described the invention of the telephone and linked it to his "dreaming place".|group=N}} The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=39}}

Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=14}} His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872, Alexander Bell opened his "School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech" in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students.{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=15}}{{sfn|Town|1988|pp=12–13}} While he was working as a private tutor, one of his pupils was [[Helen Keller]], who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak. She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that "inhuman silence which separates and estranges".{{sfn|Petrie|1975|p=17}} In 1893, Keller performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of Bell's new [[Volta Bureau]], dedicated to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf".&lt;ref name="Schoenherr2005"&gt;{{cite web |last=Schoenherr |first=Steven E. |url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/graphophone.html |website=Recording Technology History |title=Charles Sumner Tainter and the Graphophone |publisher=Audio Engineering Society |date=February 10, 2000 |access-date=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Alexander Graham Bell |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |first=David |last=Hochfelder |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-Graham-Bell |date=July 31, 2015 |access-date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort, they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of [[sign language]], thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Don |first2=Jan |last2=Branson |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1opaWDzsWwC |title=Damned For Their Difference: The Cultural Construction Of Deaf People as Disabled: A Sociological History |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Gallaudet University Press |date=2002 |pp=30–31, 152–153 |isbn=978-1-56368-121-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing [[Deaf culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Ayers |editor-first1=William C. |editor-first2=Therese |editor-last2=Quinn |editor-first3=David |editor-last3=Stovall |title=The Handbook of Social Justice in Education |location=London |publisher=Routledge |date=2009 |pp=194–195 |isbn=978-0-80585-928-7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing experimentation==
&lt;!--Linked from infobox at start of article--&gt;
In the following year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the [[Boston University]] School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was "swept up" by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping "night owl" hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover.{{sfn|Town|1988|p=15}} Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=39}} Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.

Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell retained only two students, six-year-old "Georgie" Sanders, deaf from birth, and 15-year-old [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]]. Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to "experiment". Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in.{{sfn|Town|1988|p=16}} Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years Bell's junior but became the object of his affection.

{{Main|Invention of the telephone}}
By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston "laboratory" (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success.{{refn| From {{harvp|''Alexander Graham Bell''|1979|p=8}}: "Brantford is justified in calling herself 'The Telephone City' because the telephone originated there. It was invented in Brantford at Tutela Heights in the summer of 1874."|group=N}} While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a "[[phonautograph]]", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthews |first=Tom L. |title=Always Inventing: A Photobiography of Alexander Graham Bell |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Geographic Society |date=1999 |pp=19–21 |isbn=978-0-7922-7391-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.{{sfn|Matthews|1999|p=21}}

In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of [[Western Union]] President [[William Orton (businessman)|William Orton]], had become "the nervous system of commerce". Antonio Meucci sent a telephone model and technical details to the Western Union telegraph company but failed to win a meeting with executives. When he asked for his materials to be returned, in 1874, he was told they had been lost. Two years later Bell, who shared a laboratory with Meucci, filed a patent for a telephone, became a celebrity and made a lucrative deal with Western Union. Meucci sued and was nearing victory - the supreme court agreed to hear the case and fraud charges were initiated against Bell - when the Florentine died in 1889.

Edward |title=The Telephone Patent Conspiracy of 1876: The Elisha Gray&amp;nbsp;— Alexander Bell Controversy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KiJJ7Bp-xtcC |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland Publishing |date=2000 |pp=18–25 |isbn=978-0-7864-0883-2 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the scientist [[Joseph Henry]], who was then director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had "the germ of a great invention". When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, "Get it!" That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and [[Thomas A. Watson]], an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that.

With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant,{{refn| Hubbard's financial support to the research efforts fell far short of the funds needed, necessitating Bell to continue teaching while conducting his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fitzgerald |first=Brian |url=http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2001/09-14/bell.html |title=Alexander Graham Bell: The BU Years |newspaper=B.U. Bridge |publisher=Boston University |volume=V |issue=5 |date=September 14, 2001 |access-date=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was so short of funds at times that he had to borrow money from his own employee, [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]]. Bell also sought an additional CAD$150 from the former [[Premier (Canada)|Premier of Canada]], [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], in exchange for 50% of the patent rights in the British Empire (Brown later retracted his offer to patent the telephone in the U.K. for fear of being ridiculed). The [[Bell Telephone Company#Predecessor to the Bell Company|Bell Patent Association]], composed of Hubbard, Sanders and Bell and which would become the precursor of the Bell Telephone Company (and later, [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]), would later assign an approximate 10% interest of its shares to Watson,{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=291}} in lieu of salary and for his earlier financial support to Bell while they worked together creating their first functional telephone.|group=N}} and the two of them experimented with [[acoustic telegraphy]]. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the "gallows" [[sound-powered telephone]], which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.

===The race to the patent office===
{{Main|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}
In 1875, Bell developed an [[Acoustic Telegraph|acoustic telegraph]] and drew up a [[patent application]] for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell requested that an associate in Ontario, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=158–159}}

&lt;!--not in the right article- belongs in the Gray and Bell controversy---NPOV involved--[[File:Bell-gray-smoking-gun.png|thumb|Excerpts from Elisha Gray's patent caveat of February 14 and Alexander Graham Bell's lab notebook entry of March 8, note their similarity]]---&gt;
[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: "Improvement in Telegraphy" filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing, March 7, 1876]]

Meanwhile, [[Elisha Gray]] was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.

Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. Bell's patent covered "the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound"{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|pp=12–13}}{{refn|A copy of a draft of the patent application is shown, described as "probably the most valuable patent ever."|group=N}} Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.

On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the [[electrical resistance]] in the circuit. When Bell spoke the sentence "Mr. Watson—Come here—I want to see you" into the liquid transmitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr002.html |title=Alexander Graham Bell - Lab notebook pp. 40–41 (image 22) |website=American Treasures |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=12}}

Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray,{{sfn|Shulman|2008|p=211}} Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent had been granted, and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment,{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=99}} to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible "articulate speech" (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=98}} After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|p=100}}

The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.{{sfn|Evenson|2000|pp=81–82}}

The [[Patent clerk|patent examiner]], Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in an [[affidavit]] that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, [[Marcellus Bailey]], with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100. Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The Washington Post |title=Mr. Wilbur "confesses"|date= May 22, 1886|page=1|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mr._Wilber_Confesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in [[County of Brant|Mount Pleasant]] five miles (eight&amp;nbsp;km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=14}}
[[File:Alexander Graham Telephone in Newyork.jpg|thumb|Bell at the opening of the long-distance line from New York to Chicago in 1892]]
Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25&amp;nbsp;million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fenster |first=Julie M. |title=Inventing the Telephone—And Triggering All-Out Patent War |website=American Heritage |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/events/articles/web/20060307-alexander-graham-bell-telephone-patent-telegraph-elisha-gray-thomas-watson-gardiner-hubbard-western-union-thomas-edison.shtml |date=March 7, 2006 |archive-date=March 11, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311000120/http://www.americanheritage.com/events/articles/web/20060307-alexander-graham-bell-telephone-patent-telegraph-elisha-gray-thomas-watson-gardiner-hubbard-western-union-thomas-edison.shtml |access-date=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's investors would become millionaires while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |first=Richard |title=Never the Twain Shall Meet: Bell, Gallaudet, and the Communications Debate |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Gallaudet University Press |date=1987 |p=21 |isbn=978-0-913580-99-8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the [[scientific community]] as well as the general public. A short time later, [[Bell Telephone Company#Early promotional success|his demonstration of an early telephone prototype]] at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] brought the telephone to international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Webb |editor-first=Michael |title=Alexander Graham Bell: Inventor of the Telephone |location=Mississauga, Ontario |publisher=Copp Clark Pitman |date=1991 |p=15 |isbn=978-0-7730-5049-5 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]]. Later, Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] (later, Lord Kelvin), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to [[Queen Victoria]], who had requested a private audience at [[Osborne House]], her [[Isle of Wight]] home. She called the demonstration "most extraordinary". The enthusiasm surrounding Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ross |first=Stewart |title=Alexander Graham Bell |series=(Scientists who Made History) |location=New York |publisher=Raintree Steck-Vaughn |date=2001 |pp=21–22 |isbn=978-0-7398-4415-1 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the [[carbon microphone]] from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.

Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] was the first person to buy stock in Bell's company, the Bell Telephone Company. One of the first telephones in a private residence was installed in his palace in [[Petrópolis]], his summer retreat forty miles from [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dom Pedro II and America |website=The Library of Congress |url=https://memory.loc.gov/intldl/brhtml/br-1/br-1-5-2.html |access-date=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental [[telephone call]]. Calling from the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City, Bell was heard by [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]] at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. The ''New York Times'' reported:

As is sometimes common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone.{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=19}} Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five that went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]],&lt;ref name="ATCS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Really Invented The Telephone? |website=Australasian Telephone Collecting Society |url=http://www.telephonecollecting.org/invent.htm |location=Moorebank, NSW, Australia |access-date=April 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=95}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Black |first=Harry |title=Canadian Scientists and Inventors: Biographies of People who made a Difference |location=Markham, Ontario |publisher=Pembroke |date=1997 |p=19 |isbn=978-1-55138-081-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=95}} Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments.{{sfn|Groundwater|2005|p=95}} The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and [[Amos Dolbear]].

On January 13, 1887, the U.S. Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation. After a series of decisions and reversals, the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court, though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/167/224.html |title=US v.

With a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest (on both sides) arising from the original trial, the [[United States Attorney General|US Attorney General]] dropped the lawsuit on November 30, 1897, leaving several issues undecided [[Merit (legal)|on the merits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bst.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/22/6/426.pdf |title=The United States Government vs. Alexander Graham Bell.

During a deposition filed for the 1887 trial, Italian inventor [[Antonio Meucci]] also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 1834.

The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when Bell's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C.; in 1882 he bought a home in the same city for Bell's family, so they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.{{sfn|Gray|2006|pp=202–205}}

Bell was a [[British subject]] throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882 when he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. In 1915, he characterized his status as: "I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries."{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=90}} Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly claimed as a "native son" by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom&lt;!-- Bell also lived in London, so 'UK' is more appropriate than 'Scotland' --&gt;.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=471–472}}

By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells had a vacation on [[Cape Breton Island]] in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bethune |first=Jocelyn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmtoPgAACAAJ |title=Historic Baddeck |series=(Images of our Past) |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia |publisher=Nimbus Publishing |date=2009 |p=2 |isbn=978-1-55109-706-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking [[Bras d'Or Lake]].{{sfn|Bethune|2009|p=92}} By 1889, a large house, christened ''The Lodge'' was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory,{{sfn|Bethune|2009|p=2}} were begun that the Bells would name [[Beinn Bhreagh]] (Gaelic: ''beautiful mountain'') after Bell's ancestral [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tulloch |first=Judith |title=The Bell Family in Baddeck: Alexander Graham Bell and Mabel Bell in Cape Breton |location=Halifax, Nova Scotia |publisher=Formac Publishing |date=2006 |pp=25–27 |isbn=978-0-88780-713-8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Under the direction of the Boston architects, [[Cabot, Everett &amp; Mead]], a Nova Scotia company, Rhodes, Curry &amp; Company, carried out the actual construction.|group=N}} Bell also built the [[Bell Boatyard]] on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and pleasure craft for the Bell family. He was an enthusiastic boater, and Bell and his family sailed or rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the [[H.W. Embree and Sons]] boatyard in [[Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia]]. In his final, and some of his most productive years, Bell split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and Beinn Bhreagh, where they spent increasing amounts of time.{{Sfn|MacLeod|1999|p=22}}

Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but ''Beinn Bhreagh'' would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened.

==Later inventions==
[[File:AG Bell 1.jpg|thumb|Alexander Graham Bell in his later years]]
{{Commons category|Alexander_Graham_Bell#Inventions|Bell's many inventions}}

Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to one of his biographers, [[Charlotte Gray (author)|Charlotte Gray]], Bell's work ranged "unfettered across the scientific landscape" and he often went to bed voraciously reading the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', scouring it for new areas of interest.{{sfn|Gray|2006|p=219}} The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the [[photophone]], one for the [[phonograph]], five for aerial vehicles, four for "hydroairplanes", and two for [[selenium]] cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the [[audiometer]] to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding [[alternative fuel]]s.

Bell worked extensively in [[medical research]] and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a [[magnetic field]] on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the [[tape recorder]], the [[hard disc]] and [[floppy disc]] drive, and other [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]].

Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. [[Methane]] gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with [[composting toilet]]s and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] to heat houses.

===Photophone===
{{Main|Photophone}}
[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|Photophone receiver, one half of Bell's wireless [[optical communication]] system, ca. 1880]]

Bell and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a [[photophone]], which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of [[light]].{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=336}}&lt;ref name="SDU"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Newell |url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/ar304.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020219111153/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/ar304.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 19, 2002 |title=First 'Radio' Built by San Diego Resident Partner of Inventor of Telephone: Keeps Notebook of Experiences With Bell |location=San Diego, California |website=Evening Tribune |date=July 31, 1937 |access-date=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men later became full associates in the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Laboratory projects|Volta Laboratory Association]].

On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]] in Washington, D.C., to Bell at the window of his laboratory, some {{convert|213|m|ft|-2}} away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.{{sfn|Carson|2007|pp=76–78}}{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=338}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groth |first=Mike |url=http://www.bluehaze.com.au/modlight/GrothArticle1.htm |title=Photophones Revisted |journal=Amateur Radio |date=April 1987 |pp=12–17 |access-date=September 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150802001855/http://www.bluehaze.com.au/modlight/GrothArticle1.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mims III |first=Forest M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zoaSp1BJu50C |title=The First Century of Lightwave Communications |journal=Fiber Optics Weekly Update |date=February 10–26, 1982 |pp=11 of 6–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell believed the photophone's principles were his life's "greatest achievement", telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was "the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Phillipson |first1=Donald J.C. |first2=Laura |last2=Neilson |title=Alexander Graham Bell |encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |publisher=[[Historica Canada]] |edition=online |date=March 4, 2015 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alexander-graham-bell/ |access-date=September 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photophone was a precursor to the [[fiber-optic communication]] systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|last=Morgan |first=Tim J. |title=The Fiber Optic Backbone |publisher=[[University of North Texas]] |date=2011 |url=https://classes.lt.unt.edu/Summer_10W_2011/LTEC_4550_020/tjm0146/Fiber%20Optic%20Backbone%20.docx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925132141/https://classes.lt.unt.edu/Summer_10W_2011/LTEC_4550_020/tjm0146/Fiber%20Optic%20Backbone%20.docx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-09-25 |access-date=September 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmericanScientist-1984.V72.No1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Stewart E. |jstor=i27852430 |title=Lightwaves and Telecommunication|journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=72 |issue=1 |date=January–February 1984 |pp=66–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its master patent was issued in December 1880, many decades before the photophone's principles came into popular use.

===Metal detector===
[[File:Telephone Inventor’s Voice Heard in Restored Recording « Science World.theora.ogv|thumb|Bell's voice, from a [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] recording in 1885. Restored by the Smithsonian in 2013.]]

Bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a [[metal detector]] in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President [[James Garfield]]. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.{{sfn|Grosvenor|Wesson|1997|p=107}} The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs.{{sfn|Grosvenor|Wesson|1997|p=107}} Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.{{sfn|Grosvenor|Wesson|1997|p=107}}

Bell's own detailed account, presented to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet. Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell "proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning&amp;nbsp;... to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect." In a footnote, Bell adds, "The death of President Garfield and the subsequent ''post-mortem'' examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bell |first=Alexander Graham |date=1882 |title=Upon the electrical experiments to determine the location of the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield; and upon a successful form of induction balance for the painless detection of metallic masses in the human body |journal=American Journal of Science |volume=25 |issue=145 |pages=22–61 |url=https://archive.org/details/uponelectricalex00bell |access-date=April 29, 2013 |ref=harv|bibcode=1883AmJS...25...22B |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-25.145.22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrofoils===
{{Main|HD-4}}
[[File:Bell HD-4.jpg|thumb|Bell [[HD-4]] on a test run ca. 1919]]

The March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplanes]]. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article, he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. "Casey" Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.

During his world tour of 1910–11, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the ''Dhonnas Beag'' (Scottish Gaelic for ''little devil''), the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.{{sfn|Boileau|2004|p=18}} The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial [[HD-4]], powered by [[Renault]] engines. A top speed of {{convert|54|mph|km/h}} was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability, and steering, along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.{{sfn|Boileau|2004|pp=28–30}} In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia]] to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=off}} engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of {{convert|70.86|mph|km/h|abbr=off}},{{sfn|Boileau|2004|p=30}} a record which stood for ten years.

===Aeronautics===
{{Main|Aerial Experiment Association|AEA Silver Dart}}
[[File:AEA Silver Dart.jpg|thumb|AEA Silver Dart ca.&amp;nbsp;1909]]

In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft. The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek "young" help as Bell was at the age of 60.

In 1898, Bell experimented with [[tetrahedral]] [[box kite]]s and wings constructed of multiple compound [[tetrahedral kite]]s covered in maroon silk.{{refn|Bell was inspired in part by Australian aeronautical engineer [[Lawrence Hargrave]]'s work with man-carrying box kites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technical Gazette |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=1924 |p=46}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrave declined to take patents on his inventions, similar to Bell's decision not to file patents on some of his inventions. Bell also chose maroon-colored silk as it would show up clearly against the light-colored sky in his photographic studies.|group="N"}} The tetrahedral wings were named ''Cygnet'' I, II, and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned (''Cygnet I'' crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the [[Alexander Graham Bell honors and tributes|Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns1763.ca/victco/bellmusbbm.html "Nova Scotia's Electric Scrapbook."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417080338/http://ns1763.ca/victco/bellmusbbm.html |date=April 17, 2009 }} ''ns1763.ca''. Retrieved: December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was a supporter of [[aerospace engineering]] research through the [[Aerial Experiment Association]] (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel]] and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gillis |first=Rannie |url=http://www.capebretonpost.com/Columnists/2008-09-29/article-781848/Mabel-Bell-was-a-focal-figure-in-the-first-flight-of-the-Silver-Dart/1 |title=Mabel Bell Was A Focal Figure In The First Flight of the Silver Dart |work=Cape Breton Post |location=Sydney, Nova Scotia |date=September 29, 2008 |access-date=June 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160724050315/http://www.capebretonpost.com/Columnists/2008-09-29/article-781848/Mabel-Bell-was-a-focal-figure-in-the-first-flight-of-the-Silver-Dart/1 |archivedate=July 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AEA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men: American [[Glenn H. Curtiss]], a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title "world's fastest man", having ridden his self-constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time, and who was later awarded the [[Scientific American|Scientific American Trophy]] for the first official one-kilometre flight in the [[Western hemisphere]], and who later became a world-renowned airplane manufacturer; Lieutenant [[Thomas Selfridge]], an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future; [[Frederick W. Baldwin]], the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in [[Hammondsport, New York|Hammondsport]], New York; and [[J. A .D. McCurdy]]–Baldwin and McCurdy being new engineering graduates from the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=|first1=|date=February 27, 1959|title=Canada's Golden Anniversary |magazine=[[Flight International|Flight]] |volume=75|issue=2614|page=280|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1959/1959%20-%200579.html|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the ''[[AEA Red Wing|Red Wing]]'', framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small [[Engine cooling|air-cooled]] engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Allan |title=Into the 20th Century: 1900/1910 |series=(Canada's Illustrated Heritage) |location=Toronto, Ontario |publisher=Natural Science of Canada |date=1977 |p=95 |isbn=978-0-919644-22-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 1908, over [[Keuka Lake]], the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.{{refn|"Selfridge Aerodrome Sails Steadily for {{convert|319|ft|m}}."

One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the [[aileron]], was to become a standard component on all aircraft. {{refn|The aileron had been conceived of as early as 1868 by British inventor [[Matthew Piers Watt Boulton|M.P.W. Boulton]] and was also created independently by [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] and several others.|group="N"}} The ''White Wing'' and ''June Bug'' were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard#Support to aeronautical research|$15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell]] allowed it to continue with experiments.{{sfn|Phillips|1977|p=96}} Lt. Selfridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] at [[Fort Myer]], [[Virginia]], on September 17, 1908.

Their final aircraft design, the ''[[AEA Silver Dart|Silver Dart]]'', embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines. On February 23, 1909, Bell was present as the ''Silver Dart'' flown by J. A. D. McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or made the first aircraft flight in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=|first1=|date=October 19, 1956|title=Link with Canadian Pioneers |magazine=[[Flight International|Flight]] |volume=70|issue=2491|page=642|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%201488.html|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand. With the successful flight, the AEA disbanded and the ''Silver Dart'' would revert to Baldwin and McCurdy, who began the Canadian Aerodrome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the [[Canadian Army]].{{sfn|Phillips|1977|pp=96–97}}

==Eugenics==
&lt;!--Bell's work with Eugenics is still considered contentious. Any submissions to this section should be documented in the "talk page" associated with this article.--&gt;
Bell was connected with the [[eugenics]] movement in the United States. In his lecture ''Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race'' presented to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] on November 13, 1883, he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Alexander Graham |url=http://saveourdeafschools.org/race.pdf |title=Memoir: Upon the Formation of a Deaf Variety of the Human Race |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |date=1883 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist [[David Starr Jordan]]'s Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the [[American Breeders' Association]]. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to humans.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|pp=410–417}} From 1912 until 1918, he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the [[Eugenics Record Office]] associated with [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the [[Second International Congress of Eugenics]] held under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. Organizations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the [[compulsory sterilization]] of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a "defective variety of the human race". By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Clarence Lusane |last=Lusane |first=Clarence |title=Hitler's Black Victims: The Historical Experiences of Afro-Germans, European Blacks, Africans, and African Americans in the Nazi Era |location=Hove, East Sussex, UK |publisher=Psychology Press |date=2003 |p=124 |isbn=978-0-415932-950 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew. Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities to the point that the requests almost became burdensome.&lt;ref name="AGB Family Papers"&gt;{{cite web |title=About this Collection |website=Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers |publisher=Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/collection/alexander-graham-bell-papers/about-this-collection/#overview |access-date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his life, he also received dozens of major awards, medals, and other tributes. These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, including the [[Bell Telephone Memorial]] erected in his honor in ''Alexander Graham Bell Gardens'' in [[Brantford]], Ontario, in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborne |first=Harold S. |title=Biographical Memoir of Alexander Graham Bell 1847–1922 |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/bell-alexander-graham.pdf |series=Biographical Memoirs |volume=Vol. XXIII  |p=18 |date=1943 |access-date=September 18, 2015 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Bell's writings, personal correspondence, notebooks, papers, and other documents reside in both the United States [[Library of Congress|Library of Congress Manuscript Division]] (as the ''Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers''),&lt;ref name="AGB Family Papers"/&gt; and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute, [[Cape Breton University]], Nova Scotia; major portions of which are available for online viewing.

A number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe, including the first telephone companies in the United States and Canada. Among the major sites are:
* The [[Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]], maintained by [[Parks Canada]], which incorporates the Alexander Graham Bell Museum, in [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]], close to the Bell estate [[Beinn Bhreagh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/ns/grahambell/index_e.asp |title=Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site |publisher=Parks Canada |date=August 7, 2015 |access-date=September 18, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122233/http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/ns/grahambell/index_e.asp |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site]], includes the Bell family home, "Melville House", and farm overlooking Brantford, Ontario and the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]]. It was their first home in North America;
* Canada's first telephone company building, the "Henderson Home" of the late 1870s, a predecessor of the [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company of Canada]] (officially chartered in 1880). In 1969, the building was carefully moved to the historic Bell Homestead National Historic Site in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and was refurbished to become a telephone museum. The Bell Homestead, the Henderson Home telephone museum, and the National Historic Site's reception centre are all maintained by the Bell Homestead Society;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pay Us a Call at Melville House! |url=http://www.bellhomestead.ca/Pages/default.aspx |website=Bell Homestead National Historic Site |access-date=September 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Under a wide and starry sky,
:Dig the grave and let me lie.

'''Anacarsis Lanús''' ([[Concepción del Uruguay]], [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]], Nov 14, 1820 – Oct 14, 1888) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] entrepreneur of [[French people|French]] and [[Greeks|Greek]] origin.

==Biography==
He had a formidable role during the years of the secessionist [[State of Buenos Aires]] movement. He was also Deputy Head of Police in the city of Buenos Aires.

Later, during the [[War of Triple Alliance]], he turned one of the richest men in his country as a purveyor to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] armies, and also during the [[Conquest of the Desert]].
&lt;!--== Biografía ==
En su juventud se dedicó al comercio minorista en la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Durante la gobernación de [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] hizo grandes negocios con importaciones desde Europa y con el tráfico a través del [[río Paraná]].

Después de la [[Batalla de Caseros]] se unió al partido de [[Bartolomé Mitre]] y participó en la [[revolución del 11 de septiembre de 1852]]. El gobierno del [[Estado de Buenos Aires]] lo nombró subjefe de policía de la ciudad. Durante la década siguiente fue diputado provincial y aumentó su fortuna proveyendo a las milicias que enfrentaban a los [[campañas previas a la Conquista del Desierto|indígenas del sur de la provincia]].

Fue uno de los más importantes proveedores de los ejércitos aliados durante la [[Guerra de la Triple Alianza]]. Aumentó enormemente su fortuna, y los testimonios de los militares que combatían coinciden en acusarlo de repetidas maniobras especulativas, y de proveer alimentos y vestimenta de muy inferior calidad a la contratada. Continuó prestando servicios de provisión del [[Ejército Argentino]] durante la [[rebelión jordanista]] iniciada en [[1870]]. En los años siguientes continuó negociando con la provisión de los [[fortín|fortines]] de la frontera indígena. Era considerado el hombre más rico del país.

Fundó un pueblo con su nombre, [[Lanús]], en las afueras de la ciudad de Buenos Aires, que hoy es uno de los partidos más poblados del [[Gran Buenos Aires]].

En [[1874]] se pronunció a favor de la [[Revolución de 1874|revolución]] de ese año, organizada por el ex presidente Mitre. Financió gran parte de la campaña de Mitre, de modo que cuando ésta terminó con su completa derrota perdió gran parte de su fortuna y de su prestigio comercial.

Comenzó a recuperar la fortuna perdida al producirse en [[1879]] la llamada [[Conquista del Desierto]], como proveedor del ejército organizado por el ministro general [[Julio Argentino Roca]]; debió compartir los negocios con los hermanos del ministro, especialmente con [[Ataliva Roca]].

A principios de [[1888]] comenzó a diversificar sus negocios, al conseguir la concesión del ferrocarril a [[Bolivia]]; pero falleció en octubre del mismo año, sin haber iniciado la obra.

Su hijo, también llamado Anacarsis Lanús, fue gobernador del [[Territorio Nacional del Chaco]] entre [[1911]] y [[1914]] --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1727">'''Blank endorsement''' of a financial instrument, such as a [[cheque]], is only a [[signature]], not indicating the [[payee]]. The effect of this is that it is payable only to the [[bearer instrument|bearer]] – legally, it transforms an [[order instrument]] ("pay to the ''order of'' (the payee)") into a [[bearer instrument]] ("pay to the bearer"). It is one of the types of endorsement of a [[negotiable instrument]].

It is "an endorsement consisting of nothing but a signature and allowing any party in possession of the endorsed item to execute a claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investorwords.com/5421/blank_endorsement.html Investor Words web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

A blank endorsement is a commonly known and accepted term in the legal and business worlds.&lt;ref name="Answers.com"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/blank-endorsement Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/blank+endorsement The Free Dictionary web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is also called an ''endorsement in blank''&lt;ref name="Answers.com"/&gt; or ''blank endorsement''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon W. Brown and Paul A. Sukys, ''Business law with U.C.C. Applications'' pp. 491, 929 (McGraw-Hill, 11th ed. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The prevalent spelling in American English is ''en''dorsement; the minority convention, ''in''dorsement, is found in older American documents, although the revised [[Uniform Commercial Code]] Article on negotiable instruments retains the older spelling.

In the mid-19th century, Omaha joined progressive cities that were establishing schools for girls' education. The [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] founded Brownell Hall, an all-girls [[secondary school|secondary]] [[boarding school|boarding]] school three miles north of Omaha in [[Saratoga, Nebraska|Saratoga]]. It officially opened on September 17, 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Sketch of Brownell Hall 1863-1914 by Fannie M.

A '''business record''' is a [[document]] (hard copy or digital) that records a business dealing. Business records include meeting [[minutes]], [[memoranda]], [[employment contract]]s, and [[:Category:Accounting source documents|accounting source documents]].

It must be retrievable at a later date so that the business dealings can be accurately reviewed as required. Since business is dependent upon confidence and trust, not only must the record be accurate and easily retrieved, the processes surrounding its creation and retrieval must be perceived by customers and the business community to consistently deliver a full and accurate record with no gaps or additions.

Most business records have specified [[retention period]]s based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies.  This is important because in many countries (including the United States) many documents ''may'' be required by law to be disclosed to [[Government agency|government regulatory agencies]] or to the general public.  Likewise, they ''may'' be [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] if the business is [[Lawsuit|sued]].  Under the [[business records exception]] in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], certain types of business records, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in court despite containing [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9234">'''CEDEP''', also known as '''The European Centre for Executive Development''' (in French, '''Le Centre Européen d'Education Permanente'''), is an international, not-for-profit organization co-located on the [[INSEAD]] campus in [[Fontainebleau]], France, about 50&amp;nbsp;km from Paris.  Founded in 1972, it operates as an executive club and corporate university for a diverse set of 20 global companies including [[L’Oréal]], [[Aviva]], [[Renault]], [[Bekaert]], [[Valeo]], [[AXA]], [[GDF Suez]], and [[TATA Group|TATA Steel]]. CEDEP offers two types of programs: Open Enrollment, available to managers from all member companies, and Company Specific programs. Most programs are delivered on CEDEP's  purpose-built, residential campus, but in recent years CEDEP has been delivering programs off-campus, notably in China, Brazil, and Canada.

== History ==

CEDEP was created over 40 years ago by a group of European companies as an executive education club, and was among the first corporate-founded membership institutions in Europe dedicated to executive education.&lt;ref&gt;''The nucleus of Europe's management education'', The Times (of London) May 11, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  In its early days, CEDEP was essentially a sister organization to INSEAD, which at the time focused on MBA education.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Former des cadres sur mésure'' by Jacques Malherbe, l'Aurore. November 19, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty teaching at CEDEP in its early years were drawn almost exclusively from INSEAD's more experienced faculty, notably [[Henri-Claude de Bettignies]],  Robin Hogarth, Claude Rameau, and Lee Remmers.&lt;ref&gt;''INSEAD: d'une intuition a une institution'' by Jean-Louis Barsoux, INSEAD 2000, {{ISBN|0-333-92534-3}}, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial impetus was led by L'Oréal's head of Human Resources, Guy Landon, and [[François Dalle]], its CEO.  They were joined by {{ill|Antoine Riboud|fr}} and Jean-Leon Donnadieu (BSN, which later merged with Gervais-Danone), {{ill|Renaud Gillet|fr}} (Pricel and Rhone Progil, which would become part of the Rhone-Poulenc group), {{ill|Antoine Bekaert|nl}} (Bekaert), and René Dunant (Sandoz).&lt;ref&gt;''Cedep: une "vraie" formation permanente'' by Martine Borrelly, Les Informations No. 1384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''M Renaud Gillet: vice président du Rhone Poulenc'' by A.V., Le Figaro, August 24, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The three main objectives for the founders were to: (1) expose managers to a mix of nationalities and industry contexts; (2) provide participants with a contrast between the theories and practice of management; and (3) create a force for change within their companies by establishing a critical mass of managers who had shared a key educational experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Assessing management education: A summary of the CEDEP project'' by R. M. Hogarth, Journal of European Industrial Training, 2, (Whole No. 2), pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEDEP campus was opened in 1971 by the then French Finance Minister, [[Valery Giscard d'Estaing]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inauguration à Fontainebleau du centre européen d'education permanente'' by G.S., Le Figaro November 19, 1971 (Section "Université")&lt;/ref&gt; who was to become France's President just three years later.  Designed by a contemporary French architect, Bernard de la Tour d'Auvergne, who also helped design the original buildings on the INSEAD campus, the buildings combine brick and glass to reflect the colors of the surrounding [[Fontainebleau Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture d'Aujourd'hui'' No. 160, Fevrier-Mars 1972 pp. 54-7&lt;/ref&gt;  The buildings were extended in 2000 with additional wings that conserve the architectural style of the original buildings.  The campus grounds also feature large sculptures by a number of celebrated European sculptors, including [[wikipedia:Les Lalanne|Francois-Xavier and Claude Lalanne]], who designed the original campus,&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook&gt;''CEDEP: 40 Years of Adding Value'' (an official history of CEDEP),CEDEP 2012, {{ISBN|978-2-7466-3440-4}}, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marino di Teana|Francesco Marino di Teana]].  The campus interior houses a notable collection of contemporary wall carpets by the likes of [[Sonia Delaunay]] (co-founder of the [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] movement), {{ill|Ivan da Silva-Bruhns|fr}} and [[Natalia Dumitresco]].&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;

CEDEP's evolution was greatly influenced by two long-serving Directors. In 1971 Salvatore Teresi, an INSEAD Marketing professor who was also one of CEDEP's founders, became its first Director General. Over the following 20 years he oversaw an expansion in membership to 23 companies that resulted in more than 6,000 participants attending CEDEP's programs.&lt;ref&gt;''CEDEP Twenty Years After And For A New Departure'', Text of addresses given by Guy LANDON, Claude RAMEAU, and Salvatore TERESI to mark the retirement of Salvatore TERESI as Director of CEDEP, printed by HELIO SERVICE 1991, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Michaud]], Teresi's Deputy Director (and also an INSEAD professor), took over in 1991 and led CEDEP for the next 16 years. Under his leadership CEDEP extended its membership to 20 members, including companies from outside Europe, most notably Tata Steel.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;  It was also under Michaud's tenure that CEDEP started offering off-campus programs, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and India.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;  Under the tenure of Michaud's successor, [[Han van Dissel]], CEDEP extended its overseas activities, offering off-campus programs in China, Brazil, Canada and South Korea.

In 1979, an INSEAD decision-science professor, Robin M Hogarth, who also taught at CEDEP, undertook an in-depth study of CEDEP's General Management Program in order to assess whether executive education improved managerial decision-making.  This project resulted in a book, ''Evaluating Management Education,'' published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 1979 ( {{ISBN|978-0471997399}}).

Admission to the consortium requires approval by existing members.

== Management and oversight ==

CEDEP directly employs 26 people in program design, support, and member relationship roles.  Leadership is provided by a Director, who reports to the CEDEP Board, which is appointed by member companies.  The current Director is [[Thomas Hinterseer]].

{{Competition law}}
The '''Competition and Consumer Act 2010''' (CCA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|caca2010265|Competition and Consumer Act 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Statute|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Australia]]. Prior to 1 January 2011, it was known as the '''Trade Practices Act 1974''' (TPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|tpacla22010495|Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is the legislative vehicle for [[competition law]] in Australia, and seeks to promote competition, fair trading as well as providing protection for consumers. It is administered by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC) and also gives some rights for private action. Schedule 2 of the CCA sets out the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). The [[Australian Federal Court]] has the jurisdiction to determine private and public complaints made in regard to contraventions of the Act.

==Application of Act==
The Competition and Consumer Act (CCA) is an act of the Parliament of Australia and so its application is limited by [[section 51 of the Australian Constitution]], which sets out the division of powers between the federal and state parliaments. As a result, most of the CCA is drafted to apply only to corporations, thus relying on [[Section 51(xx) of the Australian Constitution|Section 51(xx)]]. Some parts of the CCA have a broader operation, relying for instance on the telecommunications power ([[Section 51(v) of the Australian Constitution|Section 51(v)]]) or the territories power.

The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is applied as state law through the Fair Trading Acts in each Australian State and Territory, to extend the application of the ACL to individuals. The Act exempts the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments from some provisions of the Act. The immunity from the Act does not generally derive to third parties who deal with the government: see ''[[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|38|2007|litigants=[[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare]] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=29 August 2007 |parallelcite=(2007) 232 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The article: 'Consumer Protection Law in Australia' (LexisNexis 2011) by [[Ven. Alex Bruce ('Tenpa')]] was the first Australian text to critically analyze the most extensive changes to consumer protection law embodied within the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Consumer Protection Law in Australia. LexisNexis 2011 (2nd edition due 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==

===Establishing Parts===
The CCA establishes four organisations with a role in administering the Act:
* Part II establishes the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC)
* Part IIA establishes the [[National Competition Council]]
* Part III establishes the [[Australian Competition Tribunal]]
* Part IIIAA establishes the [[Australian Energy Regulator]]

===Part IIIA: Access to Services===
{{see also|Essential facilities doctrine}}
Part IIIA of the CCA deals with third party access to services of facilities of national significance. For example, it covers access to electricity grids or natural gas pipelines. The aim of this part of the act is to encourage competition in upstream or downstream markets.

This part of the Act allows services to be 'declared' and for parties to negotiate terms and conditions of access. The National Competition Council and the ACCC are both involved in registering agreement and assessing what is fair (to owners, to public, to users). As an alternative to declaring a service, it may be subject to undertakings registered with the ACCC.

===Part IV: Restrictive Trade Practices===
The restrictive trade practices, or [[antitrust]], provisions in the CCA are aimed at deterring practices by firms which are anti-competitive in that they restrict free competition. This part of the act is enforced by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC). The ACCC can litigate in the [[Federal Court of Australia]], and seek pecuniary penalties of up to $10 million from corporations and $500,000 from individuals. Private actions for compensation may also be available.

These provisions prohibit:
* Most Price Agreements (see [[Cartel]] and [[Price-Fixing]])
* Primary boycotts (an agreement between parties to exclude another)
* Secondary boycotts whose purpose is to cause substantially less competition (Actions between two persons engaging in conduct hindering 3rd person from supplying or acquiring goods or services from 4th)
* Misuse of [[market power]] – taking advantage of substantial market power in a particular market, for one or more proscribed purposes; namely, to eliminate or damage an actual or potential competitor, to prevent a person from entering a market, or to deter or prevent a person from engaging in competitive conduct.
* [[Exclusive dealing]] – an attempt to interfere with freedom of buyers to buy from other suppliers, such as agreeing to supply a product only if a retailer does not stock a competitor's product. Most forms of exclusive dealing are only prohibited if they have the purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition in a market.
* Third-line forcing: A type of exclusive dealing, third-line forcing involves the supply of goods or services on the condition that the acquirer also acquires goods or services from a third party. Third-line forcing is prohibited per se.
* [[Resale price maintenance]] – fixing a price below which resellers cannot sell or advertise
* [[Mergers and acquisitions]] that would result in a substantial lessening of competition

A priority of ACCC enforcement action in recent years has been [[cartel]]s. The ACCC has in place an immunity policy, which grants immunity from prosecution to the first party in a cartel to provide information to the ACCC allowing it to prosecute. This policy recognizes the difficulty in gaining information/evidence about price-fixing behaviours.

===Part IVB: Industry Codes===
Part IVB allows the Australian government to prescribe Industry Codes{{what?|date=March 2016}}, and breach of these codes is a breach of the Act. The ACCC administers ongoing compliance with these codes. There are currently{{when|date=March 2016}} three codes made under this part:
* the franchising code
* the oilcode, and
* the horticulture code.

===Part VII Authorisations, Notifications, and clearances in respect of restrictive trade practices===
A unique feature of the Competition and Consumer Act, which does not exist in similar legislation overseas, is that the ACCC may grant exemptions. The ACCC may grant immunity based on assessment of the public benefits and anti-competitive detriments of the conduct, through the 'notification' or 'authorisation' process. Such exemptions do not apply to resale price maintenance or misuse of market power. The ACCC maintains a public register of authorisations and notifications.

In 2006 the Act was amended to include a new Division 3 to Part VIIA providing a process for formal clearance and authorisation of mergers.

===Part VIIA: Prices surveillance, Notification, and Monitoring===
Part VIIA enables the ACCC to examine the prices of selected goods and services in the Australian economy.

The ACCC's functions under this part are:
* To hold price inquiries in relation to the supply of goods or services, and to publicly report the findings to the responsible Commonwealth minister
* To examine proposed price rises on 'notified' goods, subject to instruction from the Minister. This allows some control over price rises
* To monitor the prices, costs and profits of an industry or business under the direction of the minister and to publicly report the results to the Minister.

Australia is a free market economy; consequently, the Act does not establish the ACCC as a price-fixing body. An example of the use of this section is that, under a direction from the Minister, the ACCC monitors the price of petrol. However, the ACCC cannot set the price of petrol, which has led to complaints that the ACCC is a "toothless watchdog".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Part IX Review by Tribunal of determinations of commission===
Part IX allows the [[Australian Competition Tribunal]], established in Part III of the Act, to review certain decisions of the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]].

==== Part X Liner shipping ====
Part X provides immunities for liner shipping from the competition provisions of the Act contained in Part IV. Upon registration of agreements with the registrar of liner shipping, shipping operators may discuss and fix prices, pool revenues and losses, coordinate schedules and engange in other conduct that would otherwise breach Part IV provisions.

===Part XIB and Part XIC: Telecommunications Regulation===
The Act also regulates aspects of the Telecommunications market. In Australia the previously government-owned [[Telstra]], now privatised, has traditionally dominated the telecommunications sector. Telstra owns the copper network infrastructure.

The market was partially deregulated in 1992 with the introduction of [[Optus]] as a competitor. In 1997 deregulation continued when new entities were permitted to enter the market (see [[Communications in Australia]]). However, a feature of the Australian telecommunications market is that it is neither feasible nor efficient to have multiple networks, for example, of fibre-optic cables or of copper cables. For this reason, sections XIB and XIC of the Act exist to ensure that competitors (downstream users) have access to Telstra's networks.

'''Part XIB''' of the Act allows the ACCC to issue a Competition Notice to a carrier (telecommunications corporation) if it has reason to believe the corporation has engaged in ''"anti-competitive conduct"''. "Anti-competitive conduct" refers to the restrictive trade practices in Part IV of the Act (Sections 45, 45B, 46, 47 or 48), or when a carrier with a substantial degree of power in a telecommunications market has taken advantage of the power with the effect, or likely effect, of substantially lessening competition.

If the conduct continues after the issue of the Competition Notice, the ACCC can seek an injunction and financial penalty through the Federal Court. Competition Notices also allow third parties to take legal action.

'''Part XIC''' is a telecommunications-specific access regime. The object of Part XIC is to promote the long-term interests of end-users of telecommunications carriage services and services that facilitate the supply of such carriage services: [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tpa1974149/s152ab.html s152AB]. The extent to which something promotes the long-term interests of end-users is assessed by having regard to three, and only three, objectives, namely:

* promoting competition in markets for listed services;
* promoting any-to-any connectivity; and
* encouraging economically efficient use of, and investment in, the infrastructure by which listed services are supplied.

Under Part XIC, the ACCC can 'declare' particular telecommunications carriage services if it is in the long-term interests of end-users: [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tpa1974149/s152al.html s152AL]. Suppliers of declared services must comply with standard access obligations: [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tpa1974149/s152ar.html s152AR].

Persons can obtain access to declared services on terms and conditions set either:
* by agreement with the supplier of the declared service,
* by an ordinary access undertaking given by the supplier of the declared service, or
* through arbitration by the ACCC.

===Schedule 2: Australian Consumer Law===

The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) is based on the proposition that low consumer power or lack of information is a market failure which needs to be addressed by interference in the market.

These parts deal with:
* Unfair Practices (including unconscionable conduct, [[misleading or deceptive conduct]] and unfair contracts) - Chapter 2 and Part 3-1
* Conditions and Warranties in Consumer Transactions – Part 3-2
* Product safety and information - Part 3-3
* Product Liability - Part 3-5

====Misleading or Deceptive Conduct====
{{main|Misleading or deceptive conduct}}
Misleading or deceptive conduct (s 18 of the ACL, formerly s 52 of the TPA) is one of the most important consumer parts of the act. It allows both individuals and the ACCC to take action against corporations who engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive.

Misleading or deceptive conduct carried out by companies can also be prosecuted by the state (under Chapter 4 of the ACL).

====Unconscionable Conduct====
The inclusion of unconscionable conduct in the Australian Consumer Law is a codification and extension of the equitable principle of '[[unconscionability]]' which was later clarified as a cause-of-action.&lt;ref name="151 CLR 447"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|14|1983|litigants=[[Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio]] |parallelcite=(1983) 151 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 447 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court of Australia held that an act was unconscionable if a party to a transaction is under a '[[special disability]]', the other party is or ought be aware of that disability, and that other party acts in a way that makes it unfair or unconscionable to accept the offer of the weaker party.&lt;ref name="Blomley v Ryan (1956) 99 CLR 362"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|81|1956|litigants=Blomley v Ryan |parallelcite=(1956) 99 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 362 |date=28 March 1956 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 20 codifies the common law by referring to the "unwritten law" (i.e. the [[common law]]). However, the inclusion of section 20 allows for remedies under the Law.

Section 21 bans unconscionability in consumer transactions. Section 22 gives factors that indicate unconscionability. This clarifies the application of unconscionability and circumstances where a consumer is at a "special disability".

====Other Unfair Practices====
The Australian Consumer Law also prohibits a range of other unfair practices including bait advertising (advertising a product that is not reasonably available), pyramid schemes (Division 3 of Part 3-1 of the ACL, formerly Division 1AAA of Part IV of the TPA), and certain misrepresentations (e.g. a misrepresentation as to price).

====Consumer Guarantees (Division 1 of Part 3-2)====

The Australian Consumer Law implies into contracts with consumers certain guarantees (these were formerly known as warranties). Similar conditions are implied by the State Sale of Goods Acts, but these acts have slightly different jurisdictional limits (e.g. 'consumer' and 'goods') and the legislative phrases may have been interpreted slightly differently.

Under the Trade Practices Act implied conditions and warranties are mandatory: they cannot be excluded by a contractual intent to the contrary. The implied conditions are as to title (s 53 of the ACL, formerly s 69 of the TPA), quiet possession, freedom from encumbrances, fitness for purpose (s 55 of the ACL, formerly s 71 of the TPA), supply by description or sample (s 56, s 57) and that the goods are of acceptable quality (s 54 of the ACL, formerly s 66 of the TPA, which used the term "merchantable quality"). As a caveat, where the consumer guarantees are not that of title, undisturbed possession or undisclosed securities, they only apply if the goods or services in question are supplied in trade or commerce.

The most important of these to a consumer is likely to be acceptable quality. If goods fail to reach a basic level of quality (considering the price of the goods) – that is they are defective, break, or do not do what they should do – then the ACL has been breached.

===The Dawson Report===
The Review of the Competition Provisions of the Trade Practices Act ([[Dawson Report]]) was released in January 2003 and received 212 submissions. The scope of the report was quite broad, with recommendations regarding mergers and acquisitions, exclusionary provisions, third line forcing, joint ventures, penalties and remedies, and the functions and powers of the ACCC. As a result, some amendments have been made to the Act.

'''Congregation Beth Israel West Side Jewish Center''' is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] congregation located at 347 West [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], [[Manhattan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]],&lt;ref name=Homepage&gt;[[#refHomepage|Synagogue website]].&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]].&lt;ref name=Dunlap2004p23/&gt; Established in 1890, it constructed its current building in 1924–1925.&lt;ref name=Dunlap2004p23/&gt; Rabbis have included Joseph Schick,&lt;ref name=NYT19380318/&gt; [[Norman Lamm]],&lt;ref name=NYT19521122/&gt; and Solomon Kahane.&lt;ref name=NYT20040420/&gt; {{As of|2010}}, the rabbi was Jason Herman.&lt;ref name=Rabbi/&gt;

==Early history==
'''Congregation Beth Israel West Side Jewish Center''' was established in 1890&lt;ref name=Founded/&gt; by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[German Jews]] and Jews from [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=History&gt;[[#refHistory|History, Synagogue website]].&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years the congregation worshiped at 252 West [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]],&lt;ref name=History/&gt;&lt;ref name=refAJYearBookV21p460&gt;[[#refAJYearBookV21|''American Jewish Year Book'', Vol. 21]], p.&amp;nbsp;460.&lt;/ref&gt; a building later purchased by St. Paul Baptist Church.&lt;ref name=Dunlap2004p23&gt;[[#refDunlap2004|Dunlap (2004)]], p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the congregation constructed a new [[synagogue]] building at 252 West 35th Street, designed by architect John H. Knubel.&lt;ref name=Dunlap2004p23/&gt; Its sanctuary sat 600.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; In 1924, it broke ground for its current three-story building at 347 West 34th Street. Designed by Gronenberg &amp; Leuchtag, it was completed in 1925.&lt;ref name=Dunlap2004p23/&gt;

Dr. Joseph Schick became [[rabbi]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=NYT19380318&gt;[[#refNYT19380318|''The New York Times'', March 18, 1938]], p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Ónod]] in Austria-Hungary in 1892, he served as a chaplain in the Austro-Hungarian army during World War I, and was the rabbi of Budapest's Beth Israel synagogue of 1918 to 1922, then emigrated to the United States. His books ''The Kaddish: Its Power for Good'' and ''Joseph's Harvest'' were published in 1928 and 1932 respectively.&lt;ref name=Rosentein1990p143&gt;[[#refRosentein1990|Rosenstein (1990)]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; He served until his death in 1938, at age 49.&lt;ref name=NYT19380318/&gt;

Schick was succeeded in 1939 by Harry M. Katzen&lt;ref name=NYT19390213&gt;[[#refNYT19390213|''The New York Times'', February 13, 1939]], p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt; and then William Novack,&lt;ref name=NYT19390905&gt;[[#refNYT19390905|''The New York Times'', September 15, 1939]], p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; and then in 1940 by Leo Ginsburg.&lt;ref name=NYT19400426&gt;[[#refNYT19400426|''The New York Times'', April 26, 1940]], Sports section p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1950s to 2000==
In 1952, [[Norman Lamm]], later president of [[Yeshiva University]] for over 25 years, was appointed to the role.&lt;ref name=NYT19521122&gt;[[#refNYT19521122|''The New York Times'', November 22, 1952]], p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; He would serve until 1958, before moving to the (unrelated) [[Upper West Side]] [[Jewish Center (Manhattan, New York)|Jewish Center]].&lt;ref name=UWSJChistory&gt;[[#refUWSJChistory|History, Upper West Side Jewish Center website]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:West Side Jewish Center Demons jeh.jpg|left|thumb|Billboard for the film [[Angels &amp; Demons (film)|Angels &amp; Demons]] on the side of the synagogue building]]
Solomon (Shlomo) Kahane, [[semikhah|ordained]] in 1954 at Yeshiva University, was subsequently rabbi of the congregation for 38 years; he died in April, 2004.&lt;ref name=NYT20040420&gt;[[#refNYT20040420|''The New York Times'', April 20, 2004]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YUReview2005pp38-39"&gt;[[#refYUReview2005|''Yeshiva University Review'', Winter 2005]], pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a first cousin of Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], the founder of the [[Jewish Defense League]] and the [[List of political parties in Israel|Israeli political party]] ''[[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]]''. The Jewish Defense League's first meeting was held at the West Side Jewish Center on June 18, 1968.&lt;ref name=Wheatcroft1996p279&gt;[[#refWheatcroft1996|Wheatcroft (1996)]], p.&amp;nbsp;279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedman1990p87&gt;[[#refFriedman1990|Friedman (1990)]], p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events since 2000==
Kahane was succeeded by Dr. Richard Weiss.&lt;ref name=WeissOU&gt;[[#refWeissOU|West Side Jewish Center, Orthodox Union website, 2000]].&lt;/ref&gt; A licensed physician, Weiss subsequently became rabbi of Young Israel of Hillcrest in [[Queens]].&lt;ref name=WeissRCA&gt;[[#refWeissRCA|Rabbi Richard Weiss, M.D., Rabbinical Council of America website, June 7, 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The synagogue was in the news in 2007. The congregation rents the entire side of its building for advertisements, and that year it was covered with a huge billboard for the film ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]''. The image did not offend any members, according to then-rabbi Jason Herman, and the congregation found the additional income generated by the billboard helpful for maintaining the building.&lt;ref name=Dunlap2007&gt;[[#refDunlap2007|Dunlap (2007)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2010}}, the rabbi was Jason Herman. A former [[investment banking|investment banker]], Herman received his rabbinic ordination at [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]]. He was also Executive Director of the International Rabbinic Fellowship and a fellow at Rabbis Without Borders.&lt;ref name=Rabbi&gt;[[#refRabbi|Rabbi's Page, Synagogue website]].&lt;/ref&gt; Known for his activism, he was one of 22 Jewish leaders arrested at the [[United Nations]] in 2007 after a protest demanding the removal of Iran from the body.&lt;ref name=Traiman2007&gt;[[#refTraiman2007|Traiman (2007)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he was one of a group of liberal Orthodox rabbis who boycotted kosher meat from [[Agriprocessors]] over concerns that the company's practices were unethical.&lt;ref name=NussbaumCohen2008&gt;[[#refNussbaumCohen2008|Nussbaum Cohen (2008)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Paterson is home to [[Paterson City Hall|City Hall]] and the [[Passaic County Court House]], two of the city's architectural landmarks. City Hall was designed by the New York firm Carrere and Hastings in 1894 and is modeled after the Hôtel de Ville (city hall) in [[Lyon]], France, capital of the silk industry in Europe. Downtown abounds with buildings designed by [[Fred Wesley Wentworth]], some in collaboration with his draftsman and later partner Frederick J. Vreeland, who worked in the city from the turn of the century to the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Polton| first = Richard E.| title = The Life and Times of Fred Wesley Wentworth: The Architect Who Shaped Paterson, NJ and Its People| publisher = Pine Hill Architectural Press, LLC| year = 2012| url = http://www.fredwesleywentworth.com| isbn = 9780813560786| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Paterson| publisher = Phorio| date = | url = http://en.phorio.com/?t=projectlist&amp;region=935360957| accessdate = 2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cathedral of St. John the Baptist (Paterson, New Jersey)|Cathedral of St. John the Baptist]] survived the fire.

==CBD, SID, and UEZ==
The [[central business district]] of Paterson is the area closest to the Passaic River on the west side of the city. The areas along Market Street and Main Street are some of the busiest and largest commercial districts in Paterson. Downtown was once a shopping mecca for [[northern New Jersey]]. As with many other older urban cores in the United States, it suffered as shoppers and retailers moved to the suburban shopping malls of the region. For a large part, Downtown retailers are "mom and pop" retailers who employee local residents. In 1997, a [[special improvement district]] (SID) created by Merchants and Businesses of Downtown Paterson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =  Merchants and Businesses of Downtown Paterson| publisher =  Merchants and Businesses of Downtown Paterson| date = | url = http://www.shoppaterson.org| accessdate = 2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising over 300 stakeholders, updated storefronts and beautified city streets with signage and lighting. Downtown SID employees supplement the municipal cleaning, informational, and safety services of the city by maintaining a "Clean and Safe" staff. The association participates in many city activities with sponsorships such as the Great Falls Festival and the annual [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] fireworks show, one of Northern New Jersey's largest. Additionally, the SID implements several events throughout the year in Downtown Paterson. Downtown Paterson was an [[Urban Enterprise Zone]] (UEZ), which means that participating stores sell merchandise at 3.5% sales tax, instead of the normal 7% sales tax. The UEZ also invested greatly in Downtown Paterson and the entire stretch of Main Street, with a beautification project. New street furniture such as benches, garbage cans, newspaper kiosks, bus shelters, clocks, bike racks have been installed.

==Dublin Area==
[[Dublin, Paterson|Dublin]], considered the first neighborhood of Paterson, was built up around the mills near [[Great Falls (Passaic River)|Great Falls]]. The area, which is responsible for the early growth of Paterson, has a rich history and has had a diverse and changing ethnic makeup. Originally settled by [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, the neighborhood has seen waves of [[English people|English]], [[Italians]] and more recently [[Hispanic]] immigrants. The Dublin area today incorporates parts of [[Old Great Falls Historic District]] and the area on Market Street, which has a large [[Peru]]vian and [[Argentina|Argentine]] population today.

== Wrigley Park ==
[[Wrigley Park]] is the northern section of downtown, north of Broadway and to the east of the Passaic River. Wrigley Park is a predominantly [[African-American]] community and is mostly residential. The area is considered to be one of the more dangerous sections of Paterson along with areas of the [[Northside, Paterson|Northside]],{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} although the crime rate has declined gradually in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2014/11/filling_the_void_paterson_sets_sights_on_hundreds_of_abandoned_properties.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Northside ==
[[Northside, Paterson|Northside]] is a mostly residential neighborhood on the north bank of the Passaic River. The neighborhood stretches back to Paterson's borders with [[Haledon, New Jersey|Haledon]] and [[Prospect Park, New Jersey|Prospect Park]]. The neighborhoods on this side of the river are up a steep hill that gives many of the houses and streets in the Northside great views of [[Manhattan]].

==Transportation==
Train service began with the [[Paterson and Hudson River Railroad]] in 1833. Erie Railroad ran service on its [[Newark Branch]] and Main Line.The [[Paterson (NJT station)|Paterson rail station]] is located in Downtown.

[[Imagination:Leighton-Duty-1883.jpg|right|thumb|"Duty" by [[Edmund Leighton]]]]
A '''duty''' (from "due" meaning "that which is owing"; {{lang-fro|deu, did}}, past participle of ''devoir''; {{lang-la|debere, debitum}}, whence "[[debt]]") is a commitment or expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances arise.  A duty may arise from a system of [[ethics]] or [[morality]], especially in an [[honor culture]]. Many duties are based created by [[law]], sometimes including a codified punishment or [[Legal liability|liability]] for non-performance. Performing one's duty may require some [[sacrifice]] of [[self-interest]].

[[Cicero]], an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work “On Duty", suggests that duties can come from four different sources:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Marcus T. De Officiis. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1913. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# as result of being a human
# as a result of one's particular place in life (one's family, one's country, one's job)
# as a result of one's character
# as a result of one's own moral expectations for oneself

The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on jurisdiction, [[religion]], and social norms.

==Civic duty==
{{Main|Civic engagement}}
Duty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Joakim |last1=Ekman |first2=Erik |last2=Amnå |title=''Political Participation and Civic Engagement: Towards A New Typology'' |journal=Youth &amp; Society (Working Paper) |page=4 |year=2009 |issue=2 |url = http://www.oru.se/PageFiles/14371/Ekman%20and%20Amnå%202009-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also often perceived as something owed to one’s country (patriotism), or to one's homeland or community. Civic duties could include:

* Obey the law
* Pay taxes
* Provide for a common defense, should the need arise
* Enroll to vote, and vote at all elections and referenda (unless there is a reasonable excuse such as a religious objection, being overseas, or illness on polling day)
* Serve on a jury, if called upon
* Go to the aid of victims of accidents and street-crime and testifying as a witness later in court
* Report contagious illnesses or pestilence to public-health authorities
* Volunteer for public services (e.g. life-saving drills)
* Donate blood periodically or when needed
* [[Duty of revolution]] against an unjust government

==Duties of employment==
Specific [[obligation]]s arise in the services performed by a [[minister (religion)|minister]] of a [[Local church|church]], by a [[soldier]], or by any [[employment|employee]] or servant.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Duty|volume=8|page=736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* [[Dereliction of duty]] is an offense in U.S. military law
* [[Duty to protect]], in medicine
* ''[[In loco parentis]]'', for schools
* [[Professional responsibility]] for lawyers

==Legal duties==
Examples of legal duties include:
* [[Duty of care]]
* [[Duty of candour]]
* [[Duty to defend]] and [[duty to settle]], in insurance
* [[Duty to rescue]]
* [[Duty to retreat]]
* [[Misprision of felony|Duty to report a felony]]
* [[Duty to vote]] (in countries with mandatory voting)
* [[Duty to warn]]
* [[Fiduciary duties]]
* Duty to care for children as [[legal guardian]] (opposite of [[child neglect]])
* Special duties created by a [[contract]]

==Filial duty==
{{see also|Filial piety}}
[[Image:Admonitions Scroll Scene 4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Admonitions Scroll#Scene 4:Lady Feng and the bear|Lady Feng and the Bear]]]]
In most cultures, children are expected to take on duties in relation to their families. This may take the form of behaving in such a way that upholds the family’s honor in the eyes of the community, entering into arranged marriages that benefit the family’s status, or caring for ailing relatives. This family-oriented sense of duty is a particularly central aspect to the teachings of Confucius, and is known as xiao, or [[filial piety]]. As such, the duties of filial piety have played an enormous role in the lives of people in eastern Asia for centuries. For example, the painting ''Lady Feng and the Bear'', from ancient China, depicts the heroic act of a consort of the emperor placing herself between her husband and a rampaging bear. This is meant to be taken as an example of admirable filial behavior. Filial piety is considered so important that in some cases, it outweighs other cardinal virtues: In a more modern example, "concerns with filial piety of the same general sort that motivate women to engage in factory work in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and elsewhere in Asia are commonly cited by Thai prostitutes as one of their primary rationales for working in the skin trade".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael Gates. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor, MI: Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of filial piety can be expressed in this quote from "The Analects of Confucius": "Yu Tzu said, 'It is rare for a man whose character is such that he is good as a son and obedient as a young man to have the inclination to transgress against his superiors; it is unheard of for one who has no such inclination to be inclined to start a rebellion. The gentleman devotes his efforts to the roots, for once the roots are established, the Way will grow there from. Being good as a son and obedient as a young man is, perhaps, the root of a man's character'".

==In various cultures==
Duty varies between different cultures and continents. Duty in [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]] is commonly more heavily weighted than in [[Western culture]]. According to a study done on attitudes toward family [[obligation]]:
: "Asian and Latin American adolescents possessed stronger values and greater expectations regarding their duty to assist, respect, and support their families than their peers with European backgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;Fuligni, A. J., Tseng, V. and Lam, M. (1999), Attitudes toward Family Obligations among American Adolescents with Asian, Latin American, and European Backgrounds. Child Development, 70: 1030–1044. doi: 10.1111/1467-8624.00075.&lt;/ref&gt;
The deeply rooted [[tradition]] of duty among both Asian and Latin American cultures contributes to much of the strong sense of duty that exists in comparison to western cultures. Michael Peletz discusses the concept of duty in his book ''Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia'':
: "Notions of filial duty … are commonly invoked to mobilize the loyalties, labor power, and other resources children in the ostensible interests of the household and, in some cases, those of the lineage clan as a whole. Doctrines of filial piety … attuned to them may thus be a source of great comfort and solace to the elders but they can also be experienced as stressful, repressive, or both by those who are  enjoined to honor their parents’ (and grandparents’) wishes and unspoken expectations".&lt;ref&gt;Peletz, Michael G. Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia. Ann Arbor: 	Association for Asian Studies, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[arranged marriage]] is an example of an expected duty in Asia and the [[Middle East]]. In an arranged marriage relating to duty, it is expected that the wife will move in with the husband’s family and household to raise their children. [[Patrilocal residence]] is usual; rarely does the man move in with the woman, or is the married couple allowed to start their own household and life somewhere else. They need to provide for the entire family in labor and care for the farms and family. Older generations rely heavily on the help from their children's and grandchildren's families. This form of duty is in response to keeping the [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] of a family intact and obliging to the needs of elders.

== Criticisms of the concept ==

=== Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is among the fiercest critics of the concept of duty. "What destroys a man more quickly", he asks, "than to work, think, and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure—as a mere automaton of “duty”?" (''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', § 11)

Nietzsche claims that the task of all higher education is "to turn men into machines". The way to turn men into machines is to teach them to tolerate boredom. This is accomplished, Nietzsche says, by means of the concept of duty. (''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', “Skirmishes of an untimely man” § 9.29)

'''Earl Winfrey Brian, Jr.''' (born 1942) is an American businessman who served as Director of [[California Department of Health Care Services|California's Department of Health Care Services]], and then as Secretary of California's Agency for Health and Welfare under Governor [[Ronald Reagan]]. Following an unsuccessful run for the U. S. Senate in 1974, Brian headed several technology based firms during the 1970s and 80s.  In 1991 however, Infotechnology, the venture capital firm he headed, filed for bankruptcy. Brian was later charged with conspiring to cover up the firm's financial difficulties and sentenced to four years in prison.

==Early career==
Brian graduated from medical school at Duke University and served in the Army Medical Corps in Vietnam.&lt;ref name = "Background"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = Peterson| first = Jonathan| title = New Chief of UPI Has a Background in Politics and Information Business| work = Los Angeles Times| accessdate = 2017-05-20| date = 1988-02-22| url = http://articles.latimes.com/print/1988-02-22/business/fi-30117_1_financial-news-network}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Political career in California==
After leaving the service in 1970, he was appointed first as Director of California's [[California Department of Health Care Services|Department of Health Care Services]] (DHCS), then Secretary of Health and Welfare. During his term as secretary, Brian succeeded in implementing a requirement for a $2 co-payment from Medi-Cal recipients for each doctor’s visit,&lt;ref name="Skelton"&gt;{{cite news

In 1974 Brian resigned his cabinet post and ran for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat held by Senator [[Alan Cranston]] (D&amp;ndash;CA), but lost the Republican primary.&lt;ref name="Background" /&gt;

==Business and expansion==
Brian then turned to business and in 1980 established his own company, Biotech Capital, a venture capital firm that invested in companies developing medical technology.&lt;ref name = "Perry"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Perry| first = Nancy J.| title = To the rescue| work = Fortune article archive| accessdate = 2017-05-20| date = 1988-03-28| url = http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1988/03/28/70351/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biotech later shifted its focus to news and information services, acquiring interest in the [[Financial News Network]] (FNN) and changing the name Biotech in 1987 to Infotechnology.&lt;ref name = "Perry" /&gt;.  In 1988, the company acquired [[United Press International]], one of the two major American news wire services at the time.&lt;ref name = "Background" /&gt;

==Conspiracy and fraud conviction==
Infotechnology encountered financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy in 1991, as did FNN and UPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Jones| first = Alex S.| title = THE MEDIA BUSINESS; U.P.I.

'''George Basil Zochonis''' (1852–1929) was a Greek businessman, who was the founder of [[PZ Cussons]], one of the [[United Kingdom]]'s largest personal health care and consumer goods manufacturing businesses.

==Career==
Brought up in [[Greece]], George Zochnis initially joined the trading house of ''Fisher &amp; Randall'' in [[Freetown]] in [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name=pz&gt;[http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/33870627/patersonzochonis.pdf Paterson Zochonis: History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112213702/http://www.mosi.org.uk/media/33870627/patersonzochonis.pdf |date=2011-01-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, together with [[George Paterson (businessman)|George Paterson]], he founded [[PZ Cussons|Paterson Zochonis]] and built it into a large trading house.&lt;ref name=pz/&gt; It imported West African goods ([[Arecaceae|palm products]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s etc.) into the [[United Kingdom]] and then exported them to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=pz/&gt;  It also exported [[United Kingdom|British]] goods ([[textiles]] etc.) to West Africa.&lt;ref name=pz/&gt;

He died in 1929.&lt;ref name=pz/&gt; After his death control of the business passed to Constantine Zochonis, his [[nephew]], and then more recently, to John Zochonis (Constantine's [[son]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/business/s/212/212612_sir_john_zochonis.html Sir John Zochonis] Manchester Evening News, 9 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">'''Gülkız Ürbül''' (1901–1990) was a [[Turkey|Turkish]] woman who became the first female [[muhtar (title)|muhtar]] ([[village head|village chief]]) in [[Turkey]] in 1933. She later on changed her name to '''Gül Esin Aydın'''.

==Background==
Up to 1930, women had no political rights in Turkey. Beginning in 1930, they gained suffrage in local elections by Act no. 1580, dated 3 April 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Cumhuriyetin 75.yılı, Tempo Yayıncılık, Istanbul, 1998 p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, by Act no. 2349, dated 26 October 1933, the eligibility for the post of [[muhtar (title)|muhtar]] was also included in suffrage.

Two weeks later, Ürbül was elected the muhtar in Demircidere village of the [[Çine]] district in [[Aydın Province]], marking the first time a woman was elected a political office in Turkey. (The village of Demircidere was later declared a district named [[Karpuzlu]].)

==Election and service term==
In the 1930s, Gülkız Ürbül was one of the few literate village women in Turkey. During the [[First World War]] and [[Turkish War of Independence]], she had lost her husband and five of her six brothers. In the election campaign, she ran against seven male candidates and won the muhtar election. During her short term, she initiated the construction of a road between her village and Çine and founded a cooperative to build a village room. She also banned gambling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/develop/owa/tutanak_b_sd.birlesim_baslangic_yazici?P4=20263&amp;P5=H&amp;page1=5&amp;page2=5 Parliament speech by Ertuğrul Kumcuoğlu {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feedbacks==
After the election, Mehmet Ali Bey, the governor of Çine, said that the district was proud to be the pioneer in having the first female muhtar in Turkey. [[Recep Peker]], the secretary-general of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (and later [[Prime Minister of Turkey|prime minister]] from 1946 to 1947), sent a telegram and congratulated Ürbül on becoming the first Turkish female muhtar and political officeholder.

==Death and legacy==
Ürbül spent the last 20 years of her life in the [[Nazilli]] district of Aydın Province, where she died on the 18 December, 1990. In 2011, the municipality of Aydın erected a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Gülkız.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haberciniz.biz/turkiyenin-ilk-kadin-muhtarina-baskan-aliciktan-vefa-1914551h.htm Haberciniz news page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19606">In [[economics]], the '''hold-up problem (or commitment problem)''' is central to the theory of incomplete contracts and shows the difficulty in writing complete contracts. A hold-up problem arises when two factors are present:
#Parties to a future [[Rational economic exchange|transaction]] must make noncontractible relationship-specific investments before the transaction takes place. 
#The specific form of the optimal transaction (such as quality-level specifications, time of delivery, what quantity of units) cannot be determined with certainty beforehand.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, W.P. (1992). Contractual Solutions to the Hold-Up Problem. ''The Review of Economic Studies, 4''(59), 777-793. {{jstor|2297997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hold-up problem is a situation where two parties may be able to work most efficiently by cooperating but refrain from doing so because of concerns that they may give the other party increased bargaining power, and thereby reduce their own profits. When party A has made a prior commitment to a relationship with party B, the latter can 'hold up' the former for the value of that commitment. The hold-up problem leads to severe [[economic cost]] and might also lead to underinvestment.

== Underinvestment ==

It is often argued that the possibility of a hold-up can lead to underinvestment in relation-specific investment and thus [[inefficiency]]. Underinvestment occurs because investors cannot guarantee themselves a sufficient share of the return through ex post bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingsen, T., &amp; Johannesson, M. (2004). Is There a Hold-Up Problem? ''The Scandinavian Journal of Economics, 3''(106), 475-494. {{jstor|3441120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, predictions of the outcome are very sensitive to assumptions made about the bargaining process. The bargaining process can be seen as a game with multiple equilibria. Underinvestment may occur only when the agent fails to coordinate on an efficient equilibrium.

== Principle ==

In a scenario where two risk-neutral parties S (supplier) and B (Buyer) can make profit by working together, it is efficient to work together as long as the buyers' valuation exceeds the sellers' costs (Schmitz, 2001). When the two parties could agree on a binding contract covering the whole period of the investment and anticipating all possible outcomes and providing protection for both parties in every situation that may arise at the time the investment is made, the parties would have enough confidence to make the investment, and both parties could enjoy high profits. Then, it can be assumed that there are no wealth constraints and there is no private information. According to the [[Coase theorem]], voluntary bargaining results in trade whenever it is efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitz, P.W. (2001). The Hold-Up Problem and Incomplete Contracts: A Survey of Recent Topics in Contract Theory. ''Bulletin of Economic Research, 1''(53), 1-17. Retrieved from http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/12562/2/MPRA_paper_12562.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, making such a contract is not often possible for these four reasons:
*Unforeseeable external factors
*Lack of trust
*Quality problems
*[[Asymmetric information]]

The initial contract can cover only short-term situations; eventually, renegotiation is needed, which provides an opportunity for e.g. S to hold up B. As S knows that the investment is a significant cost to B and tries to use this as leverage to negotiate an increase in its prices. In that case, S has more bargaining power, compared to B, and tries to use it to its own advantage. The source of power lies in the investment of B. For B it is hard to find out whether or not the raise in prices is reasonable. In an extreme case, S could demand 100 percent of the profits if the only alternative to B is to lose the entire initial investment. Even if the outcome would be [[Pareto efficient]], B might not accept the agreement. If the renegotiations turn out to be unsuccessful both parties are worse off: B has made an investment that goes to waste, and S lost a customer.

Inefficiency is caused by the hold-up problem when B is reluctant to make the investment ex ante from the fear that S uses its extra bargaining power to its own advantage. In that case the supplier is 'holding up' the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Balkenborg, D., Kaplan, T.R., &amp; Miller, T. (2010). A simple economic teaching experiment on the hold-up problem. ''MPRA Paper No. 24772''. Retrieved from http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/24772/1/MPRA_paper_24772.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Auto Industry ===
A historic example concerns the US car industry, but the example is sharply disputed by Coase (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Coase, R.H. (2000). The Acquisition of Fisher Body by General Motors. ''Journal of Law and Economics, 1''(43), 15-32. {{jstor|10.1086/467446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fisher Body had an exclusive contract with General Motors (GM) to supply car body parts and so Fisher Body was the only company to deliver the components according to GM's specifications. In 1920, a sharp increase in demand occurred that was above expectations. It is claimed that Fisher Body used the unforeseen situation to hold up GM by increasing the price for the additional parts produced. It has been said that the hold up led to GM acquiring Fisher Body in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, O. (1995). Firms, contracts, and financial structure. Oxford &amp; New York: Oxford University Press, Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratization of South Africa ===
During transition out of South African [[apartheid]], many white elites feared that democratization would result in [[tyranny of the majority]]. Now that fair elections were held, many wealthy whites feared that the longtime poor blacks (or their elected representatives) would expropriate wealth from the white minority. For this reason there was white resistance against democratic and fair elections. To ensure a peaceful transition (and to uphold the credibility of the elections), the [[African National Congress]] needed to make a commitment to protect the incomes and wealth of the white elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=R. P. |last=Inman |first2=D. L. |last2=Rubinfeld |year=2013 |title=Understanding the Democratic Transition in South Africa |journal=American Law and Economics Review |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–38 |doi=10.1093/aler/ahs023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This commitment allowed whites to respect the results of a democratic election which would put the majority blacks in power. That credible commitment from the ANC made the new democractic regime sufficiently attractive to whites in South Africa, otherwise they would not have agreed to transition out of autocracy.

== Solutions  ==
=== Contractual  ===
Rogerson (1992) showed the existence of a first-best contractual solution to the hold-up problem in even extremely complex environments involving x agents with arbitrarily complex transaction decisions and utility functions. He shows that three important environmental assumptions must be made:
#No [[externalities]] so that the investment of each agent directly affects only its own type. Therefore, the following situation is not allowed: a situation where a seller's investment has influence on the quality of the product that he sells to the buyer.
#[[Risk neutrality]].
#Only one investor has partially private information so that only one agent makes an investment decision.
Furthermore, the solution also requires 'powerful' contracts to be written.
#Complex contracts can be written.
#Each party commits to participate so all parties are willing to sign the contract at the time of signing.
#The contract prevents from renegotiating the outcomes of the contract so that renegotiation in equilibrium is not possible. 
According to Rogerson (1992) the hold-up problem does not necessarily create inefficiencies; when it does, one of the above requirements is not satisfied. The requirements are necessary to come to an absolutely best solution.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, W.P. (1992). Contractual Solutions to the Hold-Up Problem. ''The Review of Economic Studies, 4''(59), 777-793. {{jstor|2297997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there are direct externalities and renegotiation cannot be prevented, even under symmetric information, underinvestment cannot be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Mirrlees Approach to Mechanism Design with Renegotiation (with Applications to Hold-up and Risk Sharing)|journal = Econometrica|date = 2002|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 1–45|volume = 70|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1468-0262.t01-1-00268|first = Ilya|last = Segal|first2 = Michael D.|last2 = Whinston}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are direct externalities, the seller's investment is a hidden action and the buyer has private information about its valuation, the absolutely best solution may not be attained even when the parties have full commitment power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = On the Interplay of Hidden Action and Hidden Information in Simple Bilateral Trading Problems|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022053101927905|journal = Journal of Economic Theory|date = 2002|pages = 444–460|volume = 103|issue = 2|doi = 10.1006/jeth.2001.2790|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Subgame-Perfect Implementation Under Information Perturbations*|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/127/4/1843|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 1843|volume = 127|issue = 4|doi = 10.1093/qje/qjs026|first = Philippe|last = Aghion|first2 = Drew|last2 = Fudenberg|first3 = Richard|last3 = Holden|first4 = Takashi|last4 = Kunimoto|first5 = Olivier|last5 = Tercieux|year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of direct externalities, simple contracts may solve the hold-up problem even when each party has private information about its valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Simple contracts, renegotiation under asymmetric information, and the hold-up problem|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292101000885|journal = European Economic Review|date = 2002|pages = 169–188|volume = 46|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00088-5|first = Patrick W.|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Maskin|Maskin]] and [[Jean Tirole|Tirole]] (1999) argue that complex contracts can solve the hold-up problem when there are ex ante indescribable contingencies, and [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Hart]] and [[John Hardman Moore|Moore]] (1999) argue that the solution does not work when renegotiation cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unforeseen Contingencies and Incomplete Contracts|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/1/83|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1999|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 83–114|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-937X.00079|first = Eric|last = Maskin|first2 = Jean|last2 = Tirole}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Foundations of Incomplete Contracts|url = http://restud.oxfordjournals.org/content/66/1/115|journal = The Review of Economic Studies|date = 1999|issn = 0034-6527|pages = 115–138|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/1467-937X.00080|first = Oliver|last = Hart|first2 = John|last2 = Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, whether or not suitable contracts can solve the hold-up problem is disputed in contract theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Incomplete Contracts: Where do We Stand?|journal = Econometrica|date = 1999|issn = 1468-0262|pages = 741–781|volume = 67|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/1468-0262.00052|first = Jean|last = Tirole}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an experimental study, Hoppe and Schmitz (2011) found that option contracts may alleviate the hold-up problem even when renegotiation is possible, which may be explained by Hart and Moore's (2008) idea that contracts may serve as reference points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can contracts solve the hold-up problem?

=== Option contracts and renegotiation  ===
{{main|option contract}}
Research of [[Georg Nöldeke|Nöldeke]] and [[Klaus M. Schmidt|Schmidt]] (1995) argued that the underinvestment problem due to the hold-up problem is eliminated if parties are able to write a simple [[option contract]]. Such a contract gives the seller the right but not the obligation to deliver a fixed quantity of the good and also makes the contractual payment of the buyer dependent on the delivery decision of the seller. Thus, this contract does not depend on renegotiation or complicated mechanisms, but its crucial feature is that one of the parties can unilaterally decide whether the trade takes place. However, such a contract is unachievable unless it is possible to enforce the payments conditional on the delivery decision of the seller. That means that the court must be able to verify delivery of the good to the buyer by the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Nöldeke, G., &amp; Schmidt, K. (1995). Option Contracts and Renegotiation: A Solution to the Hold-up Problem. ''The RAND Journal of Economics, 2''(26), 163-179. {{jstor|2555911}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility was ruled out in earlier research where it was assumed that when trade fails, it is not possible for the court to distinguish whether the buyer did not accept the delivery or the seller refused to supply.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, O., &amp; Moore, J. (1988). Incomplete Contracts and Renegotiation. ''Econometrica, 4''(56), 755-785. {{jstor|1912698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical integration ===
{{main|Vertical integration}}
The organization and governance structure of a firm might be seen as a mechanism for dealing with a hold-up problem. A solution to the hold-up problem is [[vertical integration]] such as a [[merger]] in which all parts of the body being produced internally rather than outside.&lt;ref&gt;Holmström, B., &amp; Roberts, J. (1998). The Boundaries of the Firm Revisited. ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives, 4''(12), 73-94. {{jstor|2646895}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical integration shifts the ownership of the organizational asset of the firm and therewith creates more flexibility and avoids potential of a hold-up. In that way, the (transaction) costs associated with contractually induced hold-ups are saved and also the costs associated with the number of contracts written and executed. Hold-up problems are created from the existence of firm-specific investments.but also from the set of long-term contracts that are used in the presence of the certain investments. Whether a vertical integration is adopted as a solution to the hold-up problem depends on the magnitude of the specific investment and the ability to write long-term contracts, flexible enough to avoid a potential hold-up. However, the ability to write flexible long-term contracts strongly depends upon the underlying market uncertainty and the reputation of the company. Therefore, those factors will also influence the likelihood of vertical integration.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, B. (1998). Vertical Integration as Organizational Ownership: The Fisher Body-General Motors Relationship Revisited. ''Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, 1''(4), 199-213. Retrieved from http://www.heinonline.org/HOL/Page?page=199&amp;handle=hein.journals%2Fjleo4&amp;collection=journals#207&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which vertical integration can alleviate the hold-up problem also depends on the information structure. While traditional incomplete contracting models of vertical integration such as [[Sanford J. Grossman|Grossman]] and [[Oliver Hart (economist)|Hart]] (1986) assume symmetric information, Schmitz (2006) has extended the incomplete contracting framework to allow for asymmetric information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Costs and Benefits of Ownership: A Theory of Vertical and Lateral Integration|journal = Journal of Political Economy|volume = 94|issue = 4|pages = 691|doi = 10.1086/261404|first = Sanford J.|last = Grossman|first2 = Oliver D.|last2 = Hart|date = 1986|url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3450060/Hart_CostsBenefits.pdf?sequence=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Information Gathering, Transaction Costs, and the Property Rights Approach|journal = American Economic Review|date = 2006|issn = 0002-8282|pages = 422–434|volume = 96|issue = 1|doi = 10.1257/000282806776157722|first = Patrick W|last = Schmitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''indenture''' is a legal [[contract]] that reflects or covers a debt or purchase obligation. It specifically refers to two types of practices: in historical usage, an [[indentured servant]] status, and in modern usage, it is an instrument used for commercial debt or real estate transaction.

==Historical usage==
An indenture is a legal [[contract]] between two parties, particularly for [[Indentured servant|indentured labour]] or a term of [[apprenticeship]] but also for certain [[real estate|land]] transactions. The term comes from the medieval English "indenture of retainer"&lt;ref name="KOM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Kenneth O.| authorlink = Kenneth O. Morgan |title=The Oxford History of Britain|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=2001|page=126|chapter=The Early Middle Ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; a legal contract written in duplicate on the same sheet, with the copies separated by cutting along a jagged (toothed, hence the term "in''dent''ure") line so that the teeth of the two parts could later be refitted to confirm authenticity ([[Chirograph]]).&lt;ref&gt;See for example Brown, M.P., ''A Guide To Western Historical Scripts From Antiquity to 1600'', British Library, 1990, pp. 78-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Each party to the deed would then retain a part. When the agreement was made before a court of law a ''tripartite'' indenture was made, with the third piece kept at the court. The term is used for any kind of [[deed]] executed by more than one party, in contrast to a [[deed poll]] which is made by one individual. In the case of [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], the indenture shows the pledge, promises, representations and covenants of the issuing party.

Although other evidence indicates that the method has been in use from around the year 1000, the earliest surviving examples in [[England]] are from the thirteenth century. These are agreements for military service, proving that a paid, contract army was then in existence.&lt;ref name="KOM" /&gt; [[Exchequer]] records of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]'s French campaign of 1415 (the [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] campaign), including the indentures of all the captains of the army agreeing to provide specified numbers of men and at what cost, may still be read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An example of such a use can be found in the [[The National Archives|National Archives]], where an indenture, from about 1401, recording the transfer of the [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Pinley]], [[Warwickshire]], is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the early history of the United States, many European immigrants served a period of indentured labour in order to pay the cost of their transportation. This practice was common during the 17th and 18th centuries, where over half of immigrants worked off an average of three years' servitude.

==Modern usage==
'''Bond indenture''' (also '''trust indenture''' or '''deed of trust''') is a [[legal document]] issued to lenders and describes key terms such as the [[interest rate]], [[maturity date]], [[convertible bond|convertibility]], pledge, promises, representations, covenants, and other terms of the bond offering. When the [[Prospectus (finance)|offering memorandum]] is prepared in advance of marketing a bond, the indenture will typically be summarised in the "description of notes" section.

In the United States, public debt offerings in excess of $10 million require the use of an indenture of trust under the [[Trust Indenture Act of 1939]]. The rationale for this is that it is necessary to establish a collective action mechanism under which creditors can collect in a fair, orderly manner if [[default (finance)|default]] takes place (like that which occurs during [[bankruptcy]]).&lt;ref&gt;William J. Carney. ''Corporate Finance: Principles and Practice (University Casebook Series)''. Thomson-West. 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-58778-769-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No trust relationship exists between the bondholder and the issuing corporation. These two are in a regular contractual, [[arm's length principle|arm's length]], non-[[fiduciary]], non-[[equity (law)|equity]] relationship. Rather, the trustee in a "trust indenture" is a third party, usually a specialist company, who is appointed by the issuer to handle and safeguard the interests of the numerous public bondholders, in events ranging from the usual distribution of [[coupon (bond)|coupon]]s and [[principal (finance)|principal]] payments to dealing with the issuer's default, if any occurs.

'''Innovation economics''' is a growing economic theory that emphasizes [[entrepreneurship]] and [[innovation]]. Ir is based on two fundamental tenets --  the central goal of economic policy should be to spur higher [[productivity]] through greater [[innovation]], and that markets relying on [[Information|input]] [[resource]]s and [[price signal]]s alone will not always be as effective in spurring higher [[productivity]] and [[economic growth]].

This is in contrast to the two other conventional economic doctrines, [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]].

==Historical origins==

[[Joseph Schumpeter]] was one of the first and most important scholars who extensively tackled the question of innovation in Economics.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung'' (1911), ''Business Cycles'' (1939) and the most famous ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]'' (1942).&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his contemporary [[John Maynard Keynes]], Schumpeter contended that evolving institutions, [[entrepreneur]]s, and technological change were at the heart of [[economic growth]], not independent forces that are largely unaffected by policy. He argued that "capitalism can only be understood as an evolutionary process of continuous innovation and '[[creative destruction]]'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Freeman]] (2009) «Schumpeter's Business Cycles and Techno-economic Paradigms», in Wolfgang Drechsler, Erik Reinert and Rainer Kattel (Eds.) ''Techno-economic Paradigms: Essays in Honor of Carlota Perez, p. 126.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy|last=Schumpeter|first=J. A.|publisher=Routledge|year=1943|isbn=|edition=6th|location=|pages=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2015}}

But it is only within the last 15 years that a theory and narrative of economic growth focused on innovation that was grounded in Schumpeter’s ideas has emerged. Innovation economics attempted to answer the fundamental problem in the puzzle of [[total factor productivity]] growth. Continual growth of [[output (economics)|output]] could no longer be explained only in increase of [[Information|inputs]] used in the production process as understood in [[industrialization]]. Hence, innovation economics focused on a theory of economic creativity that would impact the theory of the firm and organization decision-making. Hovering between [[heterodox economics]] that emphasized the fragility of conventional assumptions and [[Mainstream economics|orthodox economics]] that ignored the fragility of such assumptions, innovation economics aims for joint didactics between the two. As such, it enlarges the Schumpeterian analyses of new technological system by incorporating new ideas of information and communication technology in the global economy.&lt;ref name="Antonelli2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Antonelli |first=C. |year=2003 |title=The Economics of Innovation, New Technologies, and Structural Change |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0415406437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innovation economics emerges on the wage of other schools of thoughts in economics, including [[new institutional economics]], [[new growth theory]], [[endogenous growth theory]], [[evolutionary economics]], neo-Schumpeterian economics—provides an economic framework that explains and helps support growth in today’s [[knowledge economy]].

Leading theorists of innovation economics include both formal economists, as well as management theorists, technology policy experts, and others. These include [[Paul Romer]], [[Elhanan Helpman]], [[Bronwyn Hall]], [[W. Brian Arthur]], [[Robert Axtell]], [[Richard R. Nelson]], [[Richard Lipsey]], [[Michael Porter]], [[Keun Lee]], [[Christopher Freeman]].

==Theory==

Innovation economists believe that what primarily drives economic growth in today’s knowledge-based economy is not [[Capital (economics)|capital]] accumulation, as claimed by neoclassicalism asserts, but innovative capacity spurred by appropriable knowledge and technological externalities. 
Economic growth in innovation economics is the end-product of:&lt;ref name="Antonelli2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Bjorn |year=2008 |title=Cities, systems of innovation and economic development |journal=Innovation: Management, Policy, and Practice |volume=10 |issue=2/3 |pages=146–55 |doi=10.5172/impp.453.10.2-3.146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* knowledge (tacit vs. codified); 
* regimes and policies allowing for [[entrepreneurship]] and innovation (i.e., [[R&amp;D]] expenditures, permits, [[license]]s); 
* technological [[Spillover effect|spillover]]s and [[externality|externalities]] between collaborative firms; 
* systems of innovation that create innovative environments (i.e., [[business cluster|cluster]]s, [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]]s, [[metropolitan area]]s).

In 1970, economist [[Milton Friedman]] said in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that a business’s sole purpose is to generate profits for their shareholders and companies that pursued other missions would be less competitive, resulting in fewer benefits to owners, employees, and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Friedman |first=M. |date=September 13, 1970 |title=A Friedman doctrine—; The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits |newspaper=[[New York Times Magazine]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet data over the past several decades shows that while profits matter, good firms supply far more, particularly in bringing innovation to the market. This fosters [[economic growth]], [[employment]] gains, and other society-wide benefits. [[Business school]] professor [[David Ahlstrom]] asserts: “the main goal of business is to develop new and innovative goods and services that generate economic growth while delivering benefits to society.”&lt;ref name="Ahlstrom2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ahlstrom |first=D. |year=2010 |title=Innovation and Growth: How Business Contributes to Society |journal=Academy of Management Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=11–24 |doi=10.5465/AMP.2010.52842948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to neoclassical economics, innovation economics offer differing perspectives on main focus, reasons for economic growth, and the assumptions of context between economic actors:
{| class="wikitable"; style=white-space; border="1"
|-
! Economic thought !! Focus !! Growth !! Context
|-
| Neoclassical || Market price signals in using scarce resources || Productive factor accumulation (capital, labor) || Individuals and firms behaving in vacuum
|-
| Innovation || Innovative capacity to create more effective processes, products, business models || Knowledge/technology (R&amp;D, patents) || Institutions of research, government, society
|}

Despite the differences in economic thought, both perspectives are based on the same core premise: the foundation of all [[economic growth]] is the [[optimization]] of the [[utilization]] of factors and the measure of success is how well the [[factor analysis|factor]] utilization is optimized. Whatever the factors, it nonetheless leads to the same situation of special [[Capital (economics)#Endowment|endowments]], varying relative [[price]]s, and [[production process]]es. So, while the two differ in [[Economics|theoretical concepts]], innovation economics can find fertile ground in [[mainstream economics]], rather than remain in diametric contention.&lt;ref name="Antonelli2003" /&gt;

==Evidence==

Empirical evidence worldwide points to a positive link between technological innovation and economic performance. The drive of [[biotechnology|biotech]] firms in [[Germany]] was due to the [[R&amp;D]] subsidies to joint projects, [[Business networking|network]] partners, and close cognitive distance of collaborative partners within a [[business cluster|cluster]]. For instance:
* These factors increased [[patent]] performance in the biotech industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fornahl |first=D. |last2=Broekel |first2=T. |last3=Boschma |first3=R. |year=2011 |title=What drives patent performance of German biotech firms? The impact of R&amp;D subsidies, knowledge networks and their location |journal=Papers in Regional Science |volume=90 |issue=2 |pages=395–418 |doi=10.1111/j.1435-5957.2011.00361.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation capacity explains much of the [[GDP]] growth in [[India]] and [[China]] between 1981–2004 but especially in the 1990s. Their development of a '''[[National innovation system|National Innovation System]]''' through heavy investment of R&amp;D expenditures and personnel, patents, and high-tech/service exports strengthened their innovation capacity. By linking the [[science]] sector with the [[business]] sector, establishing incentives for innovative activities, and balancing the import of [[technology]] and indigenous [[R&amp;D]] effort, both countries experienced rapid [[economic growth]] in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peilei |first=F. |year=2011 |title=Innovation capacity and economic development: China and India |journal=Economic Change and Restructuring |volume=44 |issue=1/2 |pages=49–73 |doi=10.1007/s10644-010-9088-2 |url=http://collections.unu.edu/view/UNU:4235 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also, the [[Council of Foreign Relations]] asserted that since the end of the 1970s, the U.S. has gained a disproportionate share of the world’s wealth through their aggressive pursuit of [[technological change]], demonstrating that technological innovation is a central catalyst of steady economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steil |first=B. |last2=Victor |first2=D. G. |last3=Nelson |first3=R. R. |year=2002 |title=Technological Innovation and Economics Performance. A Council of Foreign Relations Book |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Concisely, evidence shows that innovation contributes to steady [[economic growth]] and rise in [[per capita income]].&lt;ref name="Ahlstrom2010" /&gt;

However, some empirical studies investigating the innovation-performance-link lead to rather mixed results and indicate that the relationship is more subtle and complex than commonly assumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salge |first=T. O. |last2=Vera |first2=A. |year=2009 |title=Hospital innovativeness and organizational performance |journal=[[Health Care Management Review]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=54–67 [in particular pp. 56–58] |doi=10.1097/01.HMR.0000342978.84307.80 |pmid=19104264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the relationship between innovativeness and performance seems to differ in intensity and significance across empirical contexts, environmental circumstances, and conceptual dimensions.

All of the above has taken place in an era of data constraint, as identified by [[Zvi Griliches]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Griliches. Z ‘Productivity, R&amp;D, and the Data Constraint’ ''American Economic Review'', Vol. 84, No. 1, (March 1994) pp. 1 – 23&lt;/ref&gt; Because the primary domain of innovation is commerce the key data resides there; continually out of campus reach in reports hidden within factories, corporate offices and technical centers. This recusal still stymies progress today. Recent attempts at data transference have led, not least, to the ‘positive link’ (above) being upgraded to exact algebra between R&amp;D productivity and GDP allowing prediction from one to the other. This is pending further disclosure from commercial sources but several pertinent documents are already available.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell C.J.‘Economics, R&amp;D and Growth', [http://www.techmatt.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

While innovation is important, it is not a happenstance occurrence as a [[natural harbor]] or [[natural resource]]s are, but a deliberate, concerted effort of [[Market (economics)|markets]], [[institution]]s, [[public policy|policymakers]], and effective use of [[geography|geographic space]]. In global [[economic restructuring]], location has become a key element in establishing [[competitive advantage]] as regions focus on their unique assets to spur innovation (i.e., [[information technology]] in [[Silicon Valley]], CA; [[digital media]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea). Even more, thriving [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan economies]] that carry multiple clusters (i.e., [[Tokyo]], [[Chicago]], [[London]]) essentially fuel [[national economy|national economies]] through their pools of [[human capital]], [[innovation]], [[public space|quality place]]s, and [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Mark |first=M. |last2=Katz |first2=B. |last3=Rahman |first3=S. |last4=Warren |first4=D. |year=2008 |title=MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation |work=Brookings Institution: Metropolitan Policy Program Report |volume=2008 |pages=4–103 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cities]] become “innovative spaces” and “cradles of creativity” as drivers of innovation. They become essential to the system of innovation through the [[supply side]]: ready, available, abundant [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[Labor (economics)|labor]]; good [[infrastructure]] for productive activities, and diversified production structures that spawn [[synergies]] and hence innovation. In addition they grow due to the [[demand|demand side]]: diverse population of varying occupations, ideas, skills; high and differentiated level of [[consumer demand]]; and constant recreation of urban order especially infrastructure of [[street]]s, [[water system]]s, [[energy]], and [[transportation]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2008" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">'''Managerial Risk Accounting''' is concerned with the generation, dissemination and use of [[risk]] related [[accounting]] information to managers within organisations to enable them to judge and shape the risk situation of the organisation according to the objectives of the organisation.

== Subject ==

As a part of the [[management accounting]] system and function, managerial risk accounting has the following two main purposes:

* decision-facilitating or decisions-making
* decision-influencing or stewardship

These purposes are achieved by providing respectively relevant information to improve the ability and willingness of the employees to achieve the organisations’s goals and objectives. For the purpose of decision facilitation, decision makers should be provided with an accounting representation of the state-act-outcome set of the decision. Especially, it is necessary to provide statements concerning the likelihood or probability of states and outcomes. For the purpose of stewardship, it is necessary to provide information on the risks taken and their relation to the risk bearing capability of organisation as well as their relationship to the return generated.

== Accounting representation of risk ==

Existing accounting systems are primarily "monovalent". That is, a single accounting value is attributed to a specific object or purpose. In contrast, risk and uncertainty are formally characterised by a whole range of possible values connected to an object.

* [[Financial accounting]]: Risks are mainly represented by the recognition of [[Provision (accounting)]] or [[Contingent liability]]. [[Fair value]] measurement partially includes considerations of risk. [[Hedge accounting]] allows for limited aggregation of mutually offsetting risks.
* [[Cost accounting]]: Risks in the sense of unexpected resource consumption is accounted for by using normalised costs for those events (expected value).
* [[Capital budgeting]]: Risk representation ranges from flat adjustments to cash flows and duration via risk adjusted discount rates to decision tree analysis, stochastic simulation and real options.
* [[Performance measurement]]: Risk is usually represented in form of risk adjusted discount rates or hurdle rates.

Special risk accounting techniques do exist but are in practice mostly restricted to financial instruments as accounting objects and financial institutions as accounting subjects. They include:

* At-Risk-Measures such as [[Value at Risk]], Cash Flow at Risk or Earnings at Risk.
* Risk adjusted performance measures as [[RAROC]] and RARORAC.

In summary, it can be concluded that the representation of risk and uncertainty in accounting systems is limited in scope and technique as well as dispersed over different systems. As of now, no specialised comprehensive accounting system for the purpose of representing risk organisation wide in comparable terms has evolved. Such a system should allow for the representation of risk in accounting terms connected to the goals of the organisation such as liquidity and profitability on different organisational levels such as the organisation as a whole, business units and projects. Central to this is the configuration of adequate [[risk measure]]s to capture the risk situation and measures for the capability of the organisation to bear risks (e. g. risk capital). These measures should also take into account behavioural and cognitive aspects of [[judgement]] and [[decision making]] under risk and uncertainty.

'''Massimo Cellino''' ({{IPA-it|ˈmasːimo tʃelː'iːno}}; born 28 July 1956) is an Italian entrepreneur and [[Association football|football]] club owner. Through his family trust Eleonora Sport Ltd he was the owner and chairman of the English club [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].&lt;ref name=YEPApr11&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/leeds-united-exclusive-massimo-cellino-interview-1-6554928|title=Leeds United exclusive: Massimo Cellino interview|author=Phil Hay|date=11 April 2014 |work=Yorkshire Evening Post|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently owns [[Brescia Calcio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.football-italia.net/107947/official-cellino-buys-brescia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Cagliari Calcio===
Cellino was the chairman of the Italian association football club [[Cagliari Calcio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Fulvio |last=Bianchi |title=Sempre più Italia in Premier Cellino compra il West Ham |url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/2010/01/13/news/cellino_al_west_ham-1935955/ |work=La Repubblica |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=23 January 2010 |quote=Cellino è presidente dal 1992 del Cagliari, club che rilevò dai fratelli Orrù. |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has served as vice-president for [[Serie A]] in the [[Lega Nazionale Professionisti|Lega Calcio]].

During his years as owner of Cagliari Calcio, Cellino was instrumental in the building of their sports centre in [[Assemini]], near Cagliari, named after his father Ercole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Matt |last=Hughes |title=Man who lured Gianfranco Zola back home is latest bidder for West Ham |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/west_ham/article6987216.ece |work=The Times |date=14 January 2010 |accessdate=23 January 2010 |quote=Cellino has proved himself to be a popular and successful owner at Cagliari, providing the finance for the club’s new training ground and sports complex in Assemini .... | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Diego López|Diego López]] was sacked by Cellino as Cagliari manager on 6 April 2014, this being the 36th manager change he went through in 22 years of his tenure at Cagliari Calcio. Cellino earned the nickname ''Il mangia-allenatori'', "The Manager Eater".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2598466/Massimo-Cellino-sacks-Diego-Lopez-Cagliari-coach-just-hours-sealing-Leeds-takeover.html|title=Cellino sacks Lopez as Cagliari coach just hours after sealing Leeds takeover|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|date=7 April 2014|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29787237|title=The sack race: Are chairmen running out of patience?|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 October 2014|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellino intended to sell Cagliari Calcio, and has said that an agreed sale failed due to the wish of the prospective buyers for him to stay and run the club. He finally sold the club to the Italian entrepreneur Tommaso Giulini on June 2014 after 22 years of ownership.&lt;ref name="YEPApr11"/&gt;

===Leeds United===
In January 2014, speculation grew that Leeds would be subject to takeover by Cellino. A delegation representing Cellino was seen at [[Elland Road]], Leeds' stadium, and the [[Thorp Arch (training ground)|Thorp Arch]] training ground several times, and on 28 January it was reported that Cellino had asked for his associate and former Middlesbrough defender [[Gianluca Festa]] to sit in the dugout for Leeds' 1–1 draw with Ipswich.&lt;ref name="Sky News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11715/9143857/consortium-looks-to-re-open-leeds-takeover-talks-as-cellino-closes-on-deal|title=Consortium looks to re-open Leeds takeover talks as Cellino closes on deal |publisher=Sky News|date= |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellino had previously tried to buy [[West Ham United]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt;

On 31 January it was reported that [[Brian McDermott (footballer)|Brian McDermott]] had been sacked as manager of the club, with Gianluca Festa speculated in the media as his most likely replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/brian-mcdermott-sacked-leeds-ditch-3099605#.UuwZBPl_tXE|title=Brian McDermott sacked by Leeds as Massimo Cellino finalises takeover of the club |publisher=The Mirror|date= |accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day reports emerged suggesting [[Gulf Finance House]] (GFH) club directors were attempting to reinstate McDermott as manager, saying the Cellino family (the club's prospective new owners) had no authority to dismiss him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/leeds-confirm-agreement-over-sale-as-stunning-twist-sees-club-try-and-persuade-brian-mcdermott-to-return-as-manager-9101175.html|title=Leeds turmoil continues as directors inform Brian McDermott that new owners-in-waiting had no authority to sack him|publisher=Independent|date= |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February, McDermott's Elland Road assistant Nigel Gibbs was named as caretaker manager for the club's home derby against Huddersfield Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/cellino-flexes-his-muscles-at-leeds-united-1-6412039|title=Cellino flexes his muscles at Leeds United |publisher=Yorkshire Eve Post|date= |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the game, the club released an official statement stating McDermott had not been dismissed and remained first team manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/dq604pw575cz1c7zdt070sugw/title/brian-mcdermott-club-statement |title=Brian McDermott: Club Statement |publisher=Leeds United official website |date=1 February 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After weeks of speculation the club announced, on 7 February 2014, that they had exchanged contracts with Cellino's family consortium Eleonora Sport Ltd. The deal would see the Cellino family acquire 75% ownership of the club, subject to approval from the Football League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/16cr3klmb3cpp1xljskfrgkd8q/title/statements-from-our-owners|title=STATEMENTS FROM OUR OWNERS |publisher=Leeds United|date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26084726|title=SLeeds United exchange contracts on Massimo Cellino takeover |publisher=BBC Sport|date=7 February 2014 |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Football League rejected the proposal on 24 March 2014, stating that Cellino failed the owner's test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20140324/football-league-statement-massimo-cellino_2293334_3729469|title=Latest Football League News|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328091305/http://www.football-league.co.uk/footballleaguenews/20140324/football-league-statement-massimo-cellino_2293334_3729469|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellino exercised his right to appeal the Football Leagues's decision. His appeal was heard on 31 March 2014 by an independent QC and, on 5 April 2014, the decision was overturned as Cellino's recent conviction did not involve conduct that would 'reasonably be considered to be dishonest' based on information available to him at the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11715/9250458/sky-bet-championship-massimo-cellino-wins-appeal-against-football-league&lt;/ref&gt; GFH retained a 10 per cent stake in the club, with minority shareholders holding 25 per cent.&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt;

Cellino later said that had he known that the takeover would not proceed smoothly he would not have bought the club and described the Football League as "...really tricky, they made trouble at a time when I couldn't walk away and I submitted myself to a trial, a humiliation...I don't want to be here if the Football League don’t want me but who are they anyway?...They are acting for what's right, the principles, the ideals. Me, I sort out the f*cking problems at Leeds. I prefer to play by the rules, not to cheat."&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt; Cellino has been disparaging of GFH's management of Leeds, saying that "...You can see what’s been happening here – it's been done by people who knew they weren't staying. And now I have to clean up the sh*t...GFH made big mistakes but not on purpose. That's why I don’t go against them for the moment. But the men who were here in GFH's name did a really, really bad job. That's not GFH fault. They trust people they shouldn't."&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt; Cellino described the fans of Leeds as "...tired of eating sh*t and shutting their mouths. They accept me with enthusiasm and that gives me a lot of responsibility. I'm the richest man in the world with these fans and I can challenge anyone, everyone."&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt;

Cellino later questioned manager Brian McDermott's decision to take a holiday, proclaiming that Leeds "have no manager", and asked "Who's managing this club?' Brian, where's Brian?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Leeds owner Massimo Cellino says United has no manager|url=http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/2014-05-14/exclusive-interview-new-leeds-owner-massimo-cellino-says-united-has-no-manager/|work=ITV |date=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed that the retain and release list of players would be handled by Cellino and [[Benito Carbone]] and not McDermott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Carbone’s role with Leeds United confirmed|url=http://www.morleyobserver.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/carbone-s-role-with-leeds-united-confirmed-1-6619156 |work=Morley Observer|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds later confirmed Carbone's position at the club in a statement, confirming that he would 'be involved with all football matters, including both the first team and the academy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 30 May, Leeds reached a mutual agreement with manager Brian McDermott to end his spell at the club. With Cellino wanting to hire a head coach rather than a manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Cellino aimed to repurchase Leeds' [[Elland Road]] stadium in 2014, and expects the club to be in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of English football, by the end of the 2015–16 season.&lt;ref name=YEPApr11/&gt; In September 2014, Cellino appointed [[Darko Milanič]] as the new head coach of Leeds on a two-year deal replacing Hockaday,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/l9x1e0mkjtui12nhj4m267y8n/title/united-confirm-darko-milanic | title = UNITED CONFIRM DARKO MILANIC| publisher = Leeds United Official Website  | date = 23 September 2014 | accessdate = 23 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though Milanič was dismissed 32 days later after not winning one of his six games while in charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29774801|title=Darko Milanic: Leeds United part company with head coach|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 October 2014|accessdate=25 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 [[Neil Redfearn]] was confirmed as the new head coach of Leeds, on an initial 12-month contract with the option of a further 12 months, the contract also had a clause that would see Redfearn return to the academy if he was to leave his role as head coach.

On 1 December 2014, Cellino was disqualified by the [[Football League]] and asked to resign from the club. The Football League took the decision after obtaining documents from an Italian court, where he was found guilty of tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30276764|title=Leeds owner Massimo Cellino disqualified by Football League|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 January 2015, Cellino's appeal against the Football League's disqualification was rejected, with the appeal committee ruling that his ban would stand.

However, Cellino, and the club, were facing another charge which related to the length of time it took Cellino to present [[The Football League]] with the court documents in the first place. This was settled in March 2015, and resulted in Cellino having his ban extended until 8 May 2015, the day after the 2014–15 season ended, to which Cellino responded by saying that he would return to his president role at the club once the ban expired.

On the 2nd April, During Cellino's ban away from the club, Cellino's sporting director [[Nicola Salerno (sporting executive)|Nicola Salerno]] mysteriously suspended [[Steve Thompson (footballer, born 1964)|Steve Thompson]], Leeds assistant manager who was credited with lifting Leeds from a place above relegation to 10th in the Football Championship. Leeds had won 6 out of the previous 10 matches. On 9 April 2015, Leeds United's suspended owner, Cellino, informed the press that he believed Salerno had resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/2091921https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/02/leeds-assistant-manager-steve-thompson |title=Leeds United suspend assistant manager Steve Thompson |date=2 April 2015 |work=The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cellino, with the approval of the Football League returned to the club, rejoining the board as club chairman and president on 2 May 2015.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On 14 May 2015, Cellino carried out a press conference unveiling [[Adam Pearson]] as the club's Executive Director to work directly alongside Cellino. The press conference included Cellino leaving halfway through for a cigarette break only to return, and for the press conference to run for over an hour, with Cellino refusing to reveal the future of Head Coach Neil Redfearn. Cellino revealed that he would also sell the club if he felt he was not ready to take the club to the premier league by 2016/17 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Leeds United: Redfearn future unclear after Cellino press conference |date=14 May 2015|accessdate=|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/latest-whites-news/video-leeds-united-redfearn-future-unclear-after-cellino-press-conference-1-7261051|publisher=Yorkshire Evening Post|author=Leon Wobschall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Management''' ('''MM''', '''MBM''','''MIM''', '''MMgt''') is a post-graduate [[master’s degree]] awarded to students who normally complete a one- to two-year program of graduate level coursework in [[business management]] at an accredited academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Andreas Kaplan: A school is “a building that has four walls…with tomorrow inside”: Toward the reinvention of the business school | doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.03.010 | journal=Business Horizons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the program is designed for students interested in entering leadership roles, the degree attracts applicants from diverse academic disciplines. The MM program structure is similar to that of the [[Master of Business Administration]], Master of Arts in Management, and [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.

==Program structure==
The MM structure varies from program to program, but typically adheres to the rigor of [[Management science]]. The mode delivery of the program can be full-time,  part-time, distance-learning, accelerated, or executive. 

The MM program for younger professionals with limited professional experience often resembles an [[master of business administration|MBA program]]. It typically prepares students to handle management issues in all areas of business with the option to concentrate or specialize in one area. Most programs begin with a set of required courses and then offer more specialized courses two thirds of the way through the program.  Topics in the MM program often include those listed aside, while concentrations may focus on [[accounting]], [[finance]], [[business administration]], [[international business]]/global management, [[marketing management]], [[supply chain management]], [[human resources]], [[Nonprofit studies|nonprofit management]], and [[entrepreneurship]].  

The MM program for senior professionals with managerial experience (typically 10+ years) often resembles an Executive MBA (EMBA) program. It typically prepares students to handle the tasks associated with interdisciplinary business-related subjects such as ethical decision making, [[business law]], global business values, workplace security, [[corporate crime]], and employee motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Montauk|title=How to Get Into the Top MBA Programs, 5th Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kkSp1hHOkPUC&amp;pg=PT48|year=2010|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-7352-0450-8|pages=48+}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs focuses on helping entry and mid level managers improve their management practice with cultural competence that enable them to function across England, Canada, India, China and Brazil.

==Admissions==
Business school admission committees normally evaluate applicants based on [[bachelor degree]] and [[GPA]] score (and graduate GPA if applicable), detailed resume, letters of recommendation, essays, and personal interviews. Based on these indicators, the committee decides if the applicant is suitable for the academic profile of the program, can demonstrate considerable leadership potential, and contribute positively to the student body of the school as a whole.

'''Matthew Frank Barnett''' (6 June 1859 – 28 January 1935), also known as '''Mat Barnett''', was a [[bookmaker]] and philanthropist from [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. In his retirement, he became well known in [[Bowls|lawn bowls]]. He donated the statue of [[James Cook]] in [[Victoria Square, Christchurch|Victoria Square]] to the city. His family dwelling, [[Wharetiki House]], was a prominent landmark on [[Colombo Street]] in the [[Christchurch Central City]] until its demolition in July 2011, following a demolition order by the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]].

==Early life==
;Matthew Barnett
Barnett was born in [[Avoca, Victoria]], Australia, in 1859.&lt;ref name="Mary Bridget Whelan bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stott|first=Margaret R.|title=Mary Bridget Whelan b.1864|url=http://www.whelan.net.nz/mary_bridget_whelan.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328061309/http://www.whelan.net.nz/mary_bridget_whelan.htm|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a large family and had ten siblings.&lt;ref name=register&gt;{{NZHPT|7551|Wharetiki|27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were William Barnett, a merchant, and Rachel Barnett (née Mitchell). The family moved to [[Dunedin]], New Zealand when Matthew was six as his father was attracted by the goldfields.&lt;ref name="Mary Bridget Whelan bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=register /&gt; He left school aged 13 or 14 and had a very brief employment as a photographer's apprentice, but did not like that profession. Instead, he was apprenticed to newspapers, first the ''Otago Guardian'' and later the ''[[Otago Daily Times]]''. He worked in that profession for about five years. For the next four years, he worked in farming in [[Otago]] and [[Canterbury, New Zealand|South Canterbury]]. When he came to [[Oamaru]], he became the proprietor of the 'Star and Garter Billiard Rooms', where he had his first exposure to betting on horse races. He returned to Dunedin for some time.&lt;ref name=Chadwick&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Joseph|title=Men of Mark in the World of Sport in New Zealand|year=1906|publisher=The Brett Prtg. &amp; Pub. Co.|location= Auckland|url= https://archive.org/details/menofmarkinworld00chad |accessdate=29 July 2011|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, Barnett's family returned to Melbourne for another two years. He worked as a [[swagman]] in Australia&lt;ref name="Mary Bridget Whelan bio"/&gt; and then had employment as a tram driver in Melbourne for several months.&lt;ref name=Chadwick /&gt; In Melbourne, he married Mary Bridget Barnett (née Whelan) on 18 July 1888.&lt;ref name="Mary Bridget Whelan bio"/&gt;

;Mary Barnett (née Whelan)
Mary's father James Whelan (1836–1908) immigrated to [[Castlemaine, Victoria]] from Ireland as a teenager. He married in 1858, but his wife died only ten months later. In 1862/63, James Whelan spent nine months on [[Otago]] goldfields during the [[Central Otago Gold Rush]]. He returned to Castlemaine and married Margaret Roughan in June 1863. They knew each other from [[Kilkishen]], [[County Clare]], Ireland and met in Melbourne by chance. Soon after, James returned to Otago, with Margaret following him later that year. Their first child, Mary, was born in [[Gabriel's Gully]] in ca 1864. The family moved to nearby Wetherstons and when the goldfields were exhausted (when Mary was twelve years old), the family moved to [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref name="James Whelan bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stott|first=Margaret R.|title=James Whelan b.1836|url= http://www.whelan.net.nz/James.htm |accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary travelled to Melbourne to visit relatives of her parents. In that city, she married Matthew Frank Barnett.&lt;ref name="Mary Bridget Whelan bio" /&gt;

;Children

* Tui Frances Barnett (21 Dec 1903 – 12 Dec 1962)

==Professional life==
Some time after their wedding, the couple moved to Otago to farm.&lt;ref name=register /&gt; Barnett's brother Thomas (Tom) had a business relationship with Peter Grant and they were placing racing bets together. Matthew Barnett joined them and for half a year, they worked together. After a substantial win, they dissolved their relationship and went on their own ways.&lt;ref name=Chadwick /&gt;

;Bookmaking
Betting and bookmaking in the 1890s need to be seen in the then climate of moral and social change in New Zealand. [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|Women's suffrage]], [[Temperance movement#New Zealand|temperance]] and anti-betting were strong movements, and gaming houses were banned, which included betting shops. Bookmakers responded to the situation by giving themselves titles like 'commission agents' and 'turf accountants'. [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] was strongly lobbied by the pro-betting faction and consequently left decisions to the local level. Beginning with the Canterbury Trotting Club in 1897, racecourses responded by banning bookmakers from their properties. Those not adhering to the ban were being arrested and fined. [[Christchurch City Council]] passed a by-law in 1899 and banned bookmaking in public. Legislation was finally passed in 1908, banning gaming in public places and making it illegal for racing clubs to accept bets by telephone. An amendment to the Gaming Act in 1910 banned bookmaking altogether.&lt;ref name=register /&gt;

It was in this climate that Matthew Barnett formed a partnership 'Barnett and Grant'. It came about because Peter Grant had been banned from a racecourse for refusing to leave. Barnett, who had earlier been banned from the same course for life, but who had managed to get that decision overturned, offered to Grant to bet on a joint account. A win of £100 resulted and although the two never formalised their partnership, their further wins in this first year ran into the thousands. Luck left them, and after the second year they had lost all their earnings again. Luck was with them again, and some time after Grant's wedding in February 1896, they had sufficient capital to add a branch in Christchurch to their existing betting shop in Dunedin. Initially, the Dunedin business had to financially support the Christchurch branch, but under Barnett's business leadership in Christchurch, the situation changed and Christchurch supported the Dunedin branch.&lt;ref name=Chadwick /&gt; The Christchurch premises were in the [[Christchurch Central City|central city]] at 174 Hereford Street,&lt;ref name="1902 case"/&gt; and from 1905 on the opposite side of the road at 163 Hereford Street.&lt;ref name="1906 case"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bookmakers and their Books|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TS19060109.2.44&amp;e=-------10--1----0matthew+barnett-- |accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=Star|date=9 January 1906|issue=8517|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnett and Grant were banned from racecourses, e.g. in [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]] in 1892&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sporting|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=ODT18921203.2.20&amp;srpos=5&amp;e=-------100--1-byDA-on--0%22matthew+barnett%22-ARTICLE- |accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=Otago Daily Times|date=3 December 1892|issue=9601|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Dunedin in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talk of the Day|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=OW18940125.2.150.6|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=Otago Witness|date=25 January 1894|issue=2083|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had frequent encounters with law enforcement, and they were arrested numerous times.

Without any witness statements, the jury delivered a not guilty verdict.&lt;ref name="1902 case"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Gaming and Lotteries Act|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=OW19020521.2.103.15&amp;e=-------10--1----0matthew+barnett--|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=Otago Witness|date=21 May 1902|issue=2514|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a 1906 raid of the Christchurch office, the Police had previously sent an undercover agent to the office to place a bet in order to have some evidence for a court case.&lt;ref name="1906 case" /&gt;

In 1909, Barnett was convicted of having published horse betting details in his publication ''Daylight'' that violated the Gaming Act 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Publishing Betting News|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WC19090908.2.67&amp;srpos=7&amp;e=-------10--1----0matthew+barnett--|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=Wanganui Chronicle|volume=L |issue=12314 |date=8 September 1909|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed the conviction and it was overturned by Justice Sim as being erroneous in point of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Important Decision|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=PBH19091006.2.86&amp;e=-------10--1----0matthew+barnett--|accessdate=30 July 2011|newspaper=Poverty Bay Herald|volume=XXXVI |issue=11964 |date=6 October 1909|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of the 1910 amendment to the Gaming Act, Barnett decided to officially retire as a bookmaker, but it is likely that he continued to work underground.&lt;ref name=register /&gt;

Barnett's weekly sport magazine ''Daylight'' was taken over by ''[[The Press]]''.&lt;ref name=register /&gt;

;Arthur Barnett's
Barnett's younger brother had been apprenticed as a draper. In 1903, he established a drapery store [[Arthur Barnett (department store)|Arthur Barnett]] in Dunedin. Matthew Barnett guaranteed a £900 loan to get the business going. It developed into the leading drapery store in Otago. Matthew Barnett retained a business interest and became chair of the board. At his death, his son Olly took that role, and he in turn passed the chairmanship to his son Gary.&lt;ref name=register /&gt; The Arthur Barnett department store developed into a national chain. At its peak in the 1980s, it had 19 stores and 1,200 employees.

==Wharetiki House==
[[File:Barnett family home (colour).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wharetiki in the early 2000s]]
{{Main article|Wharetiki House}}
In 1901, Barnett bought a large section in the Christchurch central city, fronting onto Salisbury and [[Colombo Street]]s. A large family home, which he named [[Wharetiki House|Wharetiki]], was built by 1904. The address was 854 Colombo Street, and his friend and business partner Peter Grant had a house built nearby at 901 Colombo Street two years later. Wharetiki was a large and representative dwelling, displaying the wealth of its owner.&lt;ref name=register /&gt; It had several servants and Mary Barnett's unmarried younger sister Maria (known as Polly) was in charge of them.&lt;ref name="Maria Whelan bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stott|first=Margaret R.|title=Maria Whelan (Poll) b.1867 |url= http://www.whelan.net.nz/maria_whelan.htm |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary's father suffered a brain injury in 1888 and spent the remaining 20 years of his life at [[Seacliff Lunatic Asylum|Seacliff Mental Hospital]]. When he died in 1908, his wife Margaret and the children who were still at home moved to a different house in Dunedin, but later on she and her second youngest child, Bill, moved to Christchurch to live at Wharetiki. Margaret Whelan made many spontaneous trips back to Dunedin when she got nostalgic and would stay there for a few weeks at a time, but she would otherwise live at Wharetiki for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name="James Whelan bio" /&gt;

Mary Barnett fell ill in 1930 and was confined to a wheel chair. The back stairs of Wharetiki House were replaced with a lift at that stage, so that she could move around the house.&lt;ref name="Mary Bridget Whelan bio" /&gt;

After Matthew Barnett's death, the remaining family members put the house up for auction in May 1935.&lt;ref name=register /&gt; It existed until 2011, when it was demolished after suffering significant damage in the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Press demolition"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Ben|title=Bid to save historic house fails|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/5343977/Bid-to-save-historic-house-fails|accessdate=27 July 2011|newspaper=The Press|date=27 July 2011|page=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wharetiki House was registered by the [[Heritage New Zealand|New Zealand Historic Places Trust]] as a Category II heritage building.&lt;ref name=register /&gt;

==Philanthropy==
[[File:Captain Cook, Christchurch.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cook Statue, Christchurch|Statue of Captain Cook]] in Victoria Square, Christchurch]]
On journeys from Christchurch to Dunedin, Barnett would throw half-crowns to the swagmen working on the roads, as he would remember the hard times that he had when he worked on the roads in Victoria.&lt;ref name="Mary Bridget Whelan bio" /&gt;

In 1928, Barnett funded an architectural competition for a statue commemorating the three journeys of [[James Cook]] to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Captain James Cook Statue|url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/artsculture/artinthecity/statues/captainjamescookstatue.aspx|publisher=Christchurch City Council|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bromley Cemetery Guide"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenaway|first=Richard L.

A 12-ton block of Carrara marble was imported for this work.&lt;ref name="DNZB Trethewey"&gt;{{DNZB|Phillips|Jock|4t26|William Thomas Trethewey|28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnett also funded the sculpture itself, which was unveiled on 10 August 1932 in [[Victoria Square, Christchurch|Victoria Square]] by the [[Governor-General]], [[Charles Bathurst, 1st Viscount Bledisloe|Lord Bledisloe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NZHPT|7551|Wharetiki|28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This commission brought Trethewey much publicity, including coverage on Movietone News.&lt;ref name="Bromley Cemetery Guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Christchurch Statues"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statues|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Places/Memorials/Statues/|publisher=Christchurch City Libraries|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cook Statue, Christchurch|Cook Statue]] is registered as a Category II heritage item by [[Heritage New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NZHPT|1860|Cook Statue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Barnett Tiki
In his retirement, Barnett had started to play [[Bowls|lawn bowls]], and he became well known both as a player and administrator. In bowling circles, he was known as Mat Barnett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Personal|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=MEX19201127.2.16|accessdate=16 August 2011|newspaper=Marlborough Express|volume=LIV |issue=284 |date=27 November 1920|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Sportsman, Too|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZTR19280412.2.13.3|accessdate=16 August 2011|newspaper=NZ Truth|date=12 April 1928|issue=1167|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canterbury Bowling Club was only 100&amp;nbsp;m down the road on Salisbury Street. Since the early 1900s, Canterbury and Wellington had an annual competition.

Campiani was imprisoned in Uruguay without charges from December 2013 to May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/15/business/dealbook/risky-web-of-privatization-in-uruguay-where-charges-are-optional.html?_r=0 |title=Risky Web of Privatization in Uruguay Where Charges Are Optional |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/22/business/dealbook/private-equity-executive-to-be-released-from-uruguay-prison.html |title=Private Equity Executive To Be Released from Uruguay Prison |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/0ab36768-0013-11e5-abd5-00144feabdc0 |title=Former Airline Chief Campiani Released From Uruguay Prison |publisher=''Financial Times'' |date=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gustavo Herrero, executive director of the [[Harvard Business School]] Latin American Research Center, told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that local politics were to blame for the imprisonment of Campiani and his private equity partners, stating they were “ideal scapegoats.” A ''Mercero Press'' report covering the Pluna imprisonment stated that there was a “political” side to Leadgate.  According to this article, when Pluna Leadgate was launched in 2007, Agriculture Minister and future president [[José Mujica]] allegedly said: “I don’t like the looks of these cocky Argentines from Buenos Aires.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2013/12/21/uruguay-economy-minister-resigns-over-scandal-involving-flag-air-carrier-pluna |title=Uruguay Economy Minister Resigns Over Scandal Involving Flag Air Carrier PLUNA |publisher=''Merco Press'' |date=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Uruguay]] took up Campiani's appeal for release from jail. He was released on May 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/campiani-libre-abrio-polemica-sistema.html&lt;/ref&gt;  No formal charges have been filed against Camipani, as of May 2016.

Campiani holds a master's degree in Industrial Management from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and a BA degree in Finance and Economics from [[Universidad Católica Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=53897939&amp;privcapId=23063068 |title= Matías Campiani Business Biography |publisher=''Bloomberg Business''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opened in 2003, the '''Nasher Sculpture Center''' is a [[museum]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], that houses the Patsy and [[Raymond Nasher]] collection of modern and contemporary sculpture. It is located on a {{convert|2.4|acre|m2|sing=on}} site adjacent to the [[Dallas Museum of Art]] in the [[Arts District, Dallas, Texas|Dallas Arts District]]. 

==Founding==
Patsy and [[Raymond Nasher]] began collecting sculpture in the 1950s. Together they formed a comprehensive collection of masterpieces by [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Mark di Suvero]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Barbara Hepworth]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Richard Serra]], and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], among others.

In 1997, Raymond Nasher acquired a plot of land in downtown Dallas across the street from the Dallas Museum of Art and hired architect Renzo Piano to design the Nasher Sculpture Center. The Nasher Foundation funded the entire $70 million cost of designing and constructing the museum, which includes indoor and outdoor galleries. The Sculpture Center opened in 2003 and features a regularly changing exhibition of works from the Raymond and Patsy Nasher Collection. By placing the facility on what was formerly part of the old Caruth family farm of circa 1850, Ray Nasher began the realization of the Arts District in Dallas, which has since been enhanced by the construction of the [[Winspear Opera House]] and the [[Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre|Wyly Theater]].

==Architecture and garden==
[[Renzo Piano]], winner of the [[Pritzker Prize]] in 1998, is the architect of the Center's {{convert|55000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building; he had been selected after Nasher met him at the opening of the [[Beyeler Foundation]] in Basel, Switzerland, in 1997. Piano has designed several critically acclaimed art museums; foremost among them are the Beyeler Museum in Basel, the Menil Collection in Houston, and Georges Pompidou Centre in Paris (in collaboration with Richard Rogers). He has been praised as an architect who has the genius to meld art, architecture, and advanced engineering to create some of the most remarkable museums in the world.

Piano worked in collaboration with landscape architect [[Peter Walker (architect)|Peter Walker]] of PWP Landscape Architecture on the design of the {{convert|2|acre|m2|sing=on}} Garden. Walker has exerted a significant impact on the field of landscape architecture over a four-decade career. The scope of Mr. Walker's landscape projects is expansive and varied. It ranges from small gardens to new cities, corporate headquarters and academic campuses to urban plazas.

The building was constructed by [[The Beck Group]], which also served as associate architect.

The facility opened in 2003 in a 55,000-square-foot building on a 2.4-acre site adjacent to the Dallas Museum of Art. Reflective glare of the nearby [[Museum Tower (Dallas)|Museum Tower]], constructed in 2012, comes in through the glass roof, putting portions of the collection at risk of damage.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin (May 1, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/arts/design/renzo-pianos-nasher-museum-in-dallas-has-sunburn-problem.html Dallas Museum Simmers in a Neighbor's Glare] ''[[New York Times]]'.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has two levels: the ground level houses three galleries, institute offices, a boardroom and a gift shop.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Glancey (July 5, 2004), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jul/05/architecture Oasis, Texas] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The garden terraces downward to the auditorium, creating an open-air theatre.

==Program==
The Nasher Sculpture Center features rotating exhibitions drawn from the Nasher Collection as well as special exhibitions in its indoor and outdoor galleries. Among the major exhibitions organized by the Nasher are Matisse: Painter as Sculptor, the first Matisse sculpture retrospective in the U.S. in 20 years; Tony Cragg: Seeing Things, the first major U.S. museum exhibition of the artist in 20 years; and Variable States: Intention, Appearance, and Interpretation in Modern Sculpture, an exhibition and symposium on sculpture conservation organized in conjunction with the Getty. The Nasher Sculpture Center has also presented Jaume Plensa: Genus and Species; Alexander Calder and Contemporary Art: Form, Balance, Joy; and Ken Price Sculpture: A Retrospective.

Monthly events include ''Target First Saturdays'' for children and families, ''Til Midnight'' featuring [[Al Fresco dining]], twilight strolls, bands and movies, and the ''NasherSalon'' series which welcomes distinguished speakers for an evening of discourse on art, architecture, and other cultural topics of interest. The Nasher Sculpture Center also participates in the Block Party Series together with the Dallas Museum of Art, the Crow Museum of Asian Art, and others in the Dallas Arts District.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/things-to-do-in-dallas-this-weekend-oct-18-oct-21/|title=Things To Do in Dallas This Weekend: Oct. 18 - Oct. 21 - D Magazine|date=2018-10-18|work=D Magazine|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patrick "Pat" McDonagh''' is the founder and owner of [[Supermac's]], a major Irish fast food franchiser. A former school teacher, he is now a multi-millionaire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news | title= How I Made It: Pat McDonagh, md, Supermac’s  | work=[[The Times]] | url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article860850.ece | accessdate=19 August 2009 | location=London | date=2003-02-02 | first=David | last=Byers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Pat is a native of Co. Galway, where he lives with his wife Una. He was educated at Carmelite College, [[Moate]], [[County Westmeath]], and [[Mary Immaculate College]], Limerick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/pat-mcdonagh-the-cv-124008.html | title=Pat McDonagh The CV | work=The Irish Independent | date=2007-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat earned the nickname ‘Supermac’ whilst playing [[Gaelic football]] for the Carmelite College in Moate. This then became the natural choice of name for his business, “Supermac’s”.

== Business Ventures ==
He founded Supermac's in [[Ballinasloe]], [[County Galway]], [[Ireland]] in 1978 after failing to get planning permission to build a pool hall. He has expanded the franchise to over 105 stores across Ireland. Pat is joined on the board of directors by his wife Una, who is also actively involved in the running of the business.

He also owns numerous business ventures in the food and customer service industry. Among these are the Claddagh Irish Pubs, a casual Irish pub-themed chain in the United States, founded in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Supermac's owner acquires Claddagh chain for $10m  | work=[[The Irish Independent]] | url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/supermacs-owner-acquires-claddagh-chain-for-10m-1331718.html | accessdate=19 August 2009 | first=John | last=Mulligan | date=2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Pat bought the Franchise Rights for [[Papa John's Pizza|Papa John’s Pizza]] in Ireland. There are now over 63 Papa John’s Pizza outlets throughout the country. 2014 saw Pat establish SuperSubs salad and sandwich bars which provide Supermac’s customers with additional healthy options.

Pat’s newest ventures include travel plazas across Ireland including The [[Barack Obama Plaza]] off the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]] at  [[Moneygall]], Tipperary Town Plaza (Limerick Road), Mallow N20 Plaza (Limerick Road) and Junction 16 Kiltullagh Plaza (Opening early 2016). Pat has further increased his business portfolio with the recent purchase of The Killeshin Hotel, Portlaoise and the Charleville Park Hotel, Cork which follow on from the current success of the Loughrea Hotel &amp; Spa, Galway and the Castletroy Park Hotel, Limerick which were bought and developed in 2014 and 2012 respectively.  Pat also owns property around the country.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Sporting Interests ==
Pat is a keen sports fan, having a particular interest in GAA. This love of sport has seen Supermac’s sponsor many sports teams including Galway Hurling Teams, Connacht Rugby, Galway Camogie Teams, the Irish Rowing Squad and local sports clubs around Ireland.  Pat and Una are also strong supporters of charities and of the Arts in Ireland.  Supermac’s currently sponsors 114 sports teams, arts organisations and charities throughout the country.  Most recently Supermac’s have taken on the sponsorship of Galway Football and Galway Ladies Football.  Supermac’s is the first company to be worn on both the hurling and football Galway jerseys.  Now in its 25th year of sponsoring Galway Hurling, Supermac’s has put in the region of €3 million into the sport locally.{{cn|date=August 2016}} In 2018 it was announced that Supermac’s would renew its sponsorship of Galway GAA for a further five years in a deal worth €2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/agribusiness-and-food/supermac-s-in-five-year-deal-with-galway-gaa-for-2m-1.3499189|title=Supermac’s in five year deal with Galway GAA for €2m|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Legal structure===
Through a partnership in 1999 with [[H&amp;R Block]], McGladrey operated under two separate legal entities:

* McGladrey &amp; Pullen, LLP
* RSM McGladrey, Inc.

McGladrey &amp; Pullen operated under the [[Limited Liability Partnership|traditional partnership structure]] as most accounting firms, specializing in audit and attest services. RSM McGladrey was established under the partnership agreement with H&amp;R Block to provide tax and advisory services under an alternative practice structure.

In August 2011, H&amp;R Block announced it was ending its partnership and [[divesting]] RSM McGladrey to McGladrey &amp; Pullen, reuniting the firms in a traditional partnership structure. McGladrey &amp; Pullen acquired all employees, assets, and infrastructure from RSM McGladrey. The deal closed on December 1, 2011.

In May 2012, McGladrey &amp; Pullen officially changed its name to McGladrey LLP.  The change took effect at the start of the new fiscal year, May 1. In July 2012, McGladrey changed its headquarters from [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] to [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120718/NEWS01/120719764/accounting-firm-mcgladrey-shifts-hq-to-chicago |title=Accounting firm McGladrey shifts HQ to Chicago |publisher=Chicagobusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 2015 McGladrey LLP changed its name to RSM US LLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accountingtoday.com/news/firm-profession/mcgladrey-to-rebrand-as-rsm-74874-1.html |title=McGladrey to Rebrand as RSM |publisher=Accountingtoday.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGladrey was an original founding member of RSMi in 1964 (being the "M" in RSM).

'''Service science, management, and engineering''' ('''SSME''') is a term introduced by [[IBM]] to describe service science, an interdisciplinary approach to the study, design, and implementation of [[service system]]s – complex systems in which specific arrangements of people and technologies take actions that provide [[Value (economics)|value]] for others. More precisely, SSME has been defined as the application of science, management, and engineering disciplines to tasks that one organization beneficially performs for and with another.

Today, SSME is a call for academia, industry, and governments to focus on becoming more systematic about innovation in the service sector, which is the largest sector of the economy in most [[industrialized nation]]s, and is fast becoming the largest sector in [[developing nation]]s as well. SSME is also a proposed academic discipline and research area that would complement – rather than replace – the many disciplines that contribute to knowledge about service. The interdisciplinary nature of the field calls for a curriculum and competencies to advance the development and contribution of the field of SSME.&lt;ref&gt;Choudaha, Rahul [http://gradworks.umi.com/33/37/3337048.html "Competency-based curriculum for a master's program in Service Science, Management and Engineering (SSME)"], "Doctoral dissertation, University of Denver (2008)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of service==
In national economic statistics, the service sector is often defined as whatever is not agriculture or manufacturing ([[service sector|service sector – tertiary sector of the economy]] ([[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]])). Intuitively, services are processes, performances, or experiences that one person or organization does for the benefit of another – such as custom tailoring a suit, cooking a dinner to order, driving a limousine, mounting a legal defense, setting a broken bone, teaching a class, or running a business's information technology infrastructure and applications. In all cases, service involves deployment of knowledge, skills, and competences that one person or organization has for the benefit of another (Lusch &amp; Vargo), often done as a single, customized job. And in all cases, service requires substantial input from the customer or client (Sampson) – how else could your steak be customized for you unless you tell you waiter how you want it prepared? In general there are so-called front-stage and back-stage activities in any business transaction – front stage being the part that comes in contact with the customer and back stage being the part that does not (Teboul). Service depends on having a high degree of front-stage activities to interact with the customer, whereas traditional manufacturing requires very little customer input to the production process and depends almost entirely on back-stage activities.

'''There are many definitions of service in the literature. Here are a few:'''

* Services are economic activities offered by one party to another, most commonly employing time-based performances to bring about desired results in recipients themselves or in objects or other assets for which purchasers have responsibility. In exchange for their money, time, and effort, service customers expect to obtain value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities, networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.  LOVELOCK &amp; WIRTZ, "Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy," 6/e; (Upper Saddle River NJ: Prentice Hall 2007).
* A service is a time-perishable, intangible experience performed for a customer acting in the role of a co-producer. FITZSIMMONS &amp; FITZSIMMONS "Service management". (New York, NY: McGraw-Hill 2003).
* Service [is] the application of specialized competences (knowledge and skills), through deeds, processes, and performances for the benefit of another entity or the entity itself.  LUSCH &amp; VARGO, "The Service-Dominant Logic of Marketing". (Armonk, NY: ME Sharpe.  2006).

Historically, service scholars emphasized customization, but the world is changing. One of the contributions of SSME may be to help service managers to achieve standardization and its more sophisticated sibling, assembly of standardized modular service elements in several "customizable" but highly predictable permutations. Many customers seek and value standardization because it reduces variability and usually helps bring prices down. Services in the digital economy employ standardization and mass customization. A new service definition might focus on the technical nature of modern-day service, rather than on explaining away why service productivity is not doing as well as manufacturing, so that we can do something to advance the service economy.

Not all services require substantial input from the customer – one of the motivations for outsourcing in [[electronic commerce]] contexts (both [[business-to-business electronic commerce|b2b]] and [[business-to-consumer electronic commerce|b2c]]) is to hire another person or organization to do work that an individual or corporate entity doesn't want to do (or lacks the skills, knowledge, physical capabilities or equipment to perform). Particularly in areas such as maintenance, cleaning, and repair, the customer's goal may be to become involved as little as possible, preferring to leave it to the experts to determine what needs to be done. In such instances, the front-stage is pretty small.  Yet when teaching service, there's a risk of spending too much time on discussing the high-contact, customizable services that we enjoy using ourselves and not nearly enough in studying and researching the more "boring" but fast growing areas in b2b where much of the action is highly repetitive, often substantially automated, and takes place primarily behind the scenes.

==Service systems==

"[[Service system]]" is a term that frequently appears in the [[service management]], service operations, [[services marketing]], [[service design]], and service engineering literatures.

Service involves both a provider and a client working together to create value. A doctor interviews a patient, conducts some tests, and prescribes some medicine – the patient answers the questions, cooperates with the tests, and ingests the medicine faithfully. Perhaps technologies and other people are involved in the tests or in the assignment and filling of prescriptions. Together, doctor, patient, others, and technologies co-create value – in this case, patient health. These relationships and dependencies can be viewed as a system of interacting parts. In many cases, a service system is a complex kind of system – a system in which the parts interact with each other in a non-linear manner. As such, a service system is not only the sum of its parts; complex interactions between the different parts create a system which behaves in a difficult-to-predict set of patterns. In many cases, a main source of complexity in a service system is its people: the client, the provider, or other organizations.

Service systems are designed and constructed, are often very large, and, as complex systems, they have emergent properties. This makes them an engineering kind of system (in MIT's terms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT Engineering Systems Division|url=http://esd.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, large-scale service systems include major metropolitan hospitals, highway or high-rise construction projects, and large IT outsourcing operations in which one company takes over the daily operations of IT infrastructure for another. In all these cases, systems are designed and constructed to provide and sustain service, yet because of their complexity and size, operations do not always go as planned or expected, and not all interactions or results can be anticipated or accurately predicted.

==Toward a science of service==
There is a long history of academic and industrial interest in the service sector – starting with [[Adam Smith]] and continuing right up to the present day.  Yet most such interest in service has focused narrowly on marketing or management or economics.  With the rise of [[Web Services|technology-enabled services]], many traditionally manufacturing-based companies have begun to see more and more revenue generated by service operations.  So in industry, there was a growing recognition that service innovation is now as important – if not more important than – technology innovation.  Yet, service innovation is generally unknown (save for a few economists studying the relationship between investment and innovation in service industries; e.g., GADREY &amp; GALLOUJ).

The key to service science is interdisciplinarity, focusing not merely on one aspect of service but rather on service as a system of interacting parts that include people, technology, and business.  As such, service science draws on ideas from a number of existing disciplines – including computer science, cognitive science, economics, organizational behavior, human resources management, marketing, operations research, and others – and aims to integrate them into a coherent whole. In fact, IBM relabeled its initiative in this area [http://www.ibm.com/university/ssme Service Science, Management, and Engineering] to highlight the interdisciplinary nature of the effort. HP has created the [http://www.services-sciences.org Centre for Systems and Services Sciences] for the same reason.  Oracle Corp. working with IBM, joined in creating an industry consortium called the [http://www.thesrii.org Service Research and Innovation Initiative] focused on establishing what it calls "service science" as both a key area for investment by companies and governments and as a full-blown academic discipline.

The NESSI (Networked European Software and Services Initiative) group in the European Union has established a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929042347/http://www.nessi-europe.com/Nessi/Workinggroups/HorizontalWorkingGroups/ServicesSciences/tabid/244/Default.aspx Services Sciences Working Group.]

Definitions of 'service science' can be misleading. An analogy can be made with Computer Science. The success of CS is not in the definition of a basic science (as in physics or chemistry for example) but more in its ability to bring together diverse disciplines, such as mathematics, electronics and psychology to solve problems that require they all be there and talk a language that demonstrates common purpose. Services Science may be the same thing – just bigger – as an interdisciplinary umbrella that enables economists, social scientists, mathematicians, computer scientists and legislators (to name a small subset of the necessary disciplines) to cooperate in order to achieve a larger goal – analysis, construction, management and evolution of the most complex systems we have ever attempted to construct.

Universities have begun to act on the need for service science or SSME as well.  For instance, UC Berkeley created an [http://ssme.berkeley.edu SSME program]. And North Carolina State University created an [http://poole.ncsu.edu/mba/concentrations/services-management/ MBA track] for service and a computer engineering degree for services as well. In both cases, the schools recognize the interdisciplinary character of the field and incorporate content from a variety of disciplines. Other schools with interdisciplinary interests in SSME include [http://www.cbs.dk/uddannelse/kandidatuddannelser/candsoc-msc-in-social-science/msc-in-social-science-in-service-management Copenhagen Business School],[http://www.cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon University],  [https://archive.is/20080725134720/http://ssme.rhsmith.umd.edu/ University of Maryland],  [http://wpcarey.asu.edu/csl Arizona State University],  [http://niu.edu Northern Illinois University],  [http://ssme.soe.ucsc.edu UC Santa Cruz],  [https://archive.is/20121212065551/http://www.cob.sjsu.edu/ssme San Jose State University],  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070310052217/http://dsl.cs.usu.edu/cisc.html Utah State University],  [http://www.dses.rpi.edu RPI], [[University of Manchester]], [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (now as [[Aalto University]]),  [http://www.usyd.edu.au/news/84.html?newsstoryid=1651 The University of Sydney], [http://www.urjc.es/en/academics/624-ciencia-gestion-e-ingenieria-de-servicios Rey Juan Carlos University in Spain], [http://www.ksri.kit.edu/english/index.php Karlsruhe Institute of Technology],  [https://web.archive.org/web/20090718121208/http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/newsroom/article170308/index.shtml National University of Singapore],  [http://www.sis.smu.edu.sg/programme/SSME/index.asp Singapore Management University],  [http://ssme.fi.muni.cz/ Masaryk University], [http://www.mages.unimib.it/ University of Milano Bicocca], a MBA in Services Sciences, Management And Engineering at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090926200249/http://liss.ulusofona.pt/index.php/component/content/article/20 Lusofona University – Information Systems School (Portugal)], Design And Engineering Services at [http://www.ead.senac.br/graducao/tecnologia-em-gestao-de-tecnologia-da-informacao/#aba3 Senac University Center] (Brasil), [http://iss.unige.ch Geneva University] and a MBA at [https://web.archive.org/web/20140418203112/http://www.iss.nthu.edu.tw/bin/home.php?Lang=en Institute of Service Science National Tsing Hua University].

'''''The Poor Pay More''''' is a 1967 book published by [[David Caplovitz]]. It is a sociology study of what could be called the "[[poverty penalty]]", which is a concept that poor people pay more for the same goods and services as people with more money do.

[[Esther Peterson]] cited the book as being important for understanding contemporary consumer problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Charles S.|title=Do the poor pay more?|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=Jan 1968|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18–24|jstor=1249191|publisher=American Marketing Association|doi=10.2307/1249191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 a researcher cited the book as still being relevant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mierzwinski | first1 = E. | title = Colston E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7801">{{Insolvency}}
An '''unfair preference''' (or "voidable preference") is a legal term arising in [[bankruptcy law]] where a person or [[company (law)|company]] transfers [[assets]] or pays a debt to a [[creditor]] shortly before going into [[bankruptcy]], that payment or transfer can be set aside on the application of the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] or [[trustee in bankruptcy]] as an '''unfair preference''' or simply a preference.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, section 239 of the Insolvency Act 1986 of the [[United Kingdom]], which uses the term 'Preference' rather than 'Unfair Preference'; section 565 of the Corporations Act 2001 of [[Australia]][http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/]; and Sec. 547 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.&lt;/ref&gt;

The law on unfair preferences varies from country to country, but characteristically, to set a transaction or payment aside as an unfair preference, the liquidator will need to show that:
#the person or company was [[insolvent]] at the time the payment was made (either on the ''cash-flow'' test, or on the ''balance sheet'' test - it varies from country to country)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Simkovic|first = Michael|date = 2016-05-05|editor-last = Adler|editor-first = Barry|title = Making Fraudulent Transfer Law More Predictable|ssrn = 2775920|series = Handbook on Bankruptcy|location =|publisher = Edward Elgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#the person or company then went into bankruptcy within a specified time thereafter, usually referred to as the ''vulnerability period''&lt;ref&gt;Most jurisdictions apply a variable vulnerability period, for example, in some countries the vulnerability period is 6 months normally, or 2 years of the creditor is a "connected person" such as a family relative, or a company in the same group.&lt;/ref&gt;
#the payment had the effect of putting the creditor in a better position than other [[unsecured creditor]]s
#in some jurisdictions, it is also necessary to show that the bankrupt ''intended'' to grant a preference.&lt;ref&gt;This is the position in the United Kingdom (although section 239(6) says that a preferential payment in favour of a connected person gives rise to a presumption of an intention to prefer), but in Australia and in the U.S., it is not necessary to show an intention to prefer&lt;/ref&gt;

In most countries, an application to have a transaction set aside as a preference can only be made by the liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy, as the person making the payment must be in bankruptcy, and thus they are not normally liable to lawsuits from other creditors.

The effect of a successful application to have a transaction declared as an unfair preference varies. Inevitably, the creditor which received the payment or assets has to return it to the liquidator. In some countries, the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who have a [[security interest]] which catches the assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd'' (1997) BCC 282, now superseded by legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some countries have "ring-fenced" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

An unfair preference has some of the same characteristics as a [[fraudulent conveyance]],&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see section 423 of the Insolvency Act 1986&lt;/ref&gt; but legally they are separate concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Most notably, the fraudulent transfer always reduces the net worth of the transferor while the preference does not. Also, it is not necessarily for the paying party to go into bankruptcy in order to have a transaction which is a fraudulent conveyance set aside in most legal systems, and most legal systems do not require intention to defraud in order to establish an unfair preference.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is not normally any requirement to prove an intention to defraud to recover assets under an unfair preference application. However, similar to fraudulent conveyance applications, unfair preferences are often seen in connection with [[asset protection]] schemes that are entered into too late by the putative bankrupt.

Many jurisdictions provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the [[ordinary course of business]] with a view to keeping the company trading, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.

==In individual jurisdictions==

===United Kingdom===
{{see also|UK insolvency law}}
*[[Insolvency Act 1986]] section 239
*''[[Re MC Bacon Ltd (No 1)]]''

===United States===
A '''preference''' in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. federal bankruptcy law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|101}} ''[[et seq.]]'', known as the Bankruptcy Code&lt;/ref&gt; is a transfer of property by a debtor to its creditor, on account of a pre-existing debt, that is made while the debtor is insolvent&lt;ref&gt;Under the Bankruptcy Code, insolvency exists when the sum of the debtor's debts exceeds the fair value of the debtor's property, with some exceptions. It is a balance sheet test. Chapter 11 United States Code Sec. 101(32)&lt;/ref&gt; and gives the creditor more than it would obtain in a liquidation of the debtor's assets in a [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] proceeding. It is primarily a creature of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|547}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some states have similar state laws. If the preferential transaction takes place within a specified period of time before the filing of bankruptcy by or on behalf of the debtor, then the debtor's trustee in bankruptcy is authorized to recover the property preferentially transferred. The mechanism of recovery is the avoidance of the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 United States Code Secs. 547(b) and 551&lt;/ref&gt; After such avoidance, the recovered property becomes property of the bankruptcy estate.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', Sec. 551&lt;/ref&gt; The period is usually 90 days. However, if the preferential transfer is made to an "insider," then the period is one year. An "insider" is generally a relative or one who has the ability to control the activities of the debtor.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 United States Code Sec. 101(31)&lt;/ref&gt; The Bankruptcy Code provides some exemptions from these rules to accommodate transfers intended to be contemporaneous, made in the ordinary course of business or to the extent they are made for new value, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 11 United States Code Sec. 547(c)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the following examples assume that the requirements for a preference that are set out above exist at the time the transfer is made.

*Securing a previously unsecured debt.
*Substituting property of greater value as security for existing security property whose value is insufficient to completely secure repayment of the debt.
*Paying some but not all unsecured creditors.
*In a real estate transaction, delaying the recording of a mortgage for more than 30 days after the debt it secures is created.&lt;ref&gt;Bankruptcy Code Section 547(e) provides that in real estate transactions, transfers take place at the time when they are made if they are perfected within 30 days thereafter. Otherwise, the transfer is deemed by the law to be made when it is actually perfected. With respect to mortgages, perfection usually requires the [[recording (real estate)|recording]] of the mortgage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{main|Insolvency law of Switzerland}}
Under Swiss law, creditors who hold a certificate of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against third parties who have benefited from unfair preferences or [[fraudulent transfer]]s by the debtor prior to a seizure of assets or a [[bankruptcy]].

Other required courses include Constitutional Law, Evidence, Federal Income Taxation, and Professional Responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academics: Required and Bar-related Courses|url=http://www.law.udmercy.edu/academics/index.php|work=law.udmercy.edu|publisher=© 2006-2010 University of Detroit Mercy School of Law|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School's clinical program was founded as the Urban Law Clinic in 1965, and was among the earliest clinics in the nation. Since that time, the program has received numerous awards including the ABA Louis M. Brown Award for Legal Access with Meritorious Recognition in 2012 and the ABA Law Student Division’s Judy M.

'''William Brockenbrough''' (July 10, 1778 – December 10, 1838) was a [[Virginia]] lawyer, political figure and judge of the [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]].

==Biography==
Brockenbrough was born in [[Tappahannock, Virginia|Tappahannock]] in [[Essex County, Virginia]], United States, the son of Dr. John Brockenbaugh and Sarah Roane.  He attended the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1798.  He studied law and then went into private practice.  In 1802-03 he represented Essex County in the [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and became a member of the Council of State in May, 1803.  His judicial career started when he was appointed as a judge of the general court on February 7, 1809.  On February 20, 1834, he was appointed a judge of the [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Supreme Court of Appeals]] but died just four years later.

In 1806, he married [[Judith Brockenbrough|Judith Robinson White]] and became the father of [[John White Brockenbrough]].  According to family history, [[Dolley Madison]] said, "as a friend I find Mrs. Judith Brockenbrough unequalled."  In 1814, following the burning of [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] by Admiral Cockburn, she and Dolley Madison saved what valuables they could from the [[White House]] before taking refuge at the [[The Octagon House (Washington, D.C.)|Octagon House]]. Judith Brockenbrough's initials are scratched on a windowpane in an upstairs bedroom at [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]].  William Brockenbrough's home in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], at Fifth and Clay streets, was frequently visited by [[John Marshall|Chief Justice Marshall]] and other notable citizens of Richmond.

==Children==
One son, John White Brockenbroug married Mary C. Bowyer and became a judge of the United States Court for the Western District of Virginia, founder and head of his own law school at Lexington, Professor in the Law School of Washington and Lee University, member of the [[Confederate States of America]] Congress, and a publisher of law decisions. One daughter, Mary, married another lawyer, Willoughby Newton. Another daughter, named Judith White after her mother, married Episcopal clergyman John P. McQuire and published her diary written during the [[American Civil War]], "The Diary of a Southern Refugee".
