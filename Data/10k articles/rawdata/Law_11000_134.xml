A '''501(h) election''' or '''Conable election''' is a procedure in United States tax law that allows a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organization]] to participate in [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] limited only by the financial expenditure on that lobbying, regardless of its overall extent.  This allows organizations taking the 501(h) election to potentially perform a large amount of lobbying if it is done using [[Volunteering|volunteer labor]] or through inexpensive means. The 501(h) election is available to most types of 501(c)(3) organizations that are not churches or [[Private foundation (United States)|private foundations]]. It was introduced by Representative [[Barber Conable]] as part of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1976]] and [[Codification (law)|codified]] as {{USCSub|26|501|h}}, and the corresponding [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) regulations were finalized in 1990.

== Lobbying restrictions ==
[[File:IRS Building Constitution Avenue.jpg|alt=A photograph of the neoclassical Internal Revenue Service headquarters building in Washington, D.C.|thumb|The [[Internal Revenue Service]] ''(headquarters pictured)'' regulates lobbying by tax-exempt organizations.  Most [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3) organizations]] may switch from a subjective "substantial part test" to an objective "expenditure test" by making a 501(h) election.]]
501(c)(3) organizations, named after the section of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] that defines them, are the most common category of [[nonprofit organization]] in the United States.  They make up 74% of all [[501(c) organization|tax-exempt organizations]] as of 2013, encompassing organizations with charitable, educational, or religious missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business.com/incorporation-services/5-popular-types-501c/|title=The 5 Most Popular Types of 501(c)|last=Sweeney|first=Deborah|date=April 23, 2014|work=|newspaper=Business.com|access-date=December 6, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By default, 501(c)(3) organizations are subject to a provision that "no substantial part of the activities [may be] carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation".  This test, called the '''substantial part test''', is subjective and not precisely defined by the IRS, making it difficult for organizations engaging in policy advocacy to determine whether they are in compliance with the law.  Under the 501(h) election, this is replaced with an objective '''expenditure test''' based only on the annual financial expenditure, with no other limits on the actual extent of the lobbying activities.  An organization may take the 501(h) election by filing a one-page form with the IRS, which remains in effect until revoked by the organization.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/taking-the-501h-election|title=Taking the 501(h) election|date=January 17, 2015|newspaper=National Council of Nonprofits|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonprofitaccountingbasics.org/federal-tax-issues/lobbying-public-charities-501h-safe-harbor|title=Lobbying by Public Charities: The 501(h) Safe Harbor|last=Sorrells|first=R. Michael|date=February 10, 2014|website=Nonprofit Accounting Basics|publisher=Greater Washington Society of CPAs Educational Foundation|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 501(h) election is not available to churches or to [[Private foundation (United States)|private foundations]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/measuring-lobbying-activity-expenditure-test|title=Measuring Lobbying Activity: Expenditure Test|last=|first=|date=March 28, 2016|website=|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|access-date=December 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobbying is defined as attempting to influence legislation, and is divided into two categories.  The first, [[Direct lobbying in the United States|direct lobbying]], occurs through communication with any [[Member of Congress|member]] or [[Congressional staff|staff]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]], or of a state or local legislature, or any government official participating in the formulation of legislation.  The second, [[grassroots lobbying]], is attempting to affect the opinion of the general public on legislation, although some communications to an organization's own members are excluded from this classification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/lobbying|title=Lobbying|last=|first=|date=March 4, 2016|website=|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit on lobbying expenditure is calculated as a fraction of the organization's total tax-exempt expenditures.  For organizations with $500,000 or less of total tax-exempt expenditures in a given year, no more than 20% of that amount may be spent on lobbying.  Decreasing percentages are allowed for organizations with higher tax-exempt expenditures, with an absolute spending cap of $1,000,000 eventually being reached.  Lobbying expenses above the allowed amount are subject to a 25% excise tax, and excessive lobbying over a four-year period may lead to loss of tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This cap applies to the sum of direct and grassroots lobbying expenses.  Grassroots lobbying is also subject to its own limit, which is one quarter of the total lobbying cap.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i990sc.pdf|title=Instructions for Schedule C (Form 990 or 990-EZ)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless of their 501(h) status, 501(c)(3) organizations may not participate in electoral campaigns or support specific candidates for office, a prohibition that has been in effect since the passage of the [[Johnson Amendment]] in 1954.  Also, funds derived from federal government or private foundation grants or contracts may never be used for lobbying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/the-restriction-of-political-campaign-intervention-by-section-501-c-3-tax-exempt-organizations|title=The Restriction of Political Campaign Intervention by Section 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organizations|last=|first=|date=September 13, 2016|website=|publisher=U.S. Internal Revenue Service|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vernick|first=Jon S.|year=1999|title=Lobbying and Advocacy for the Public's Health: What Are the Limits for Nonprofit Organizations?|url=|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=89|issue=9|pages=1426–9|pmc=1508760|doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.9.1425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klapach|first=Joseph S.|year=1999|title=Thou Shalt Not Politic: A Principled Approach to Section 501 (C)(3)'s Prohibition of Political Campaign Activity|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2751&amp;context=clr|journal=Cornell Law Review|volume=84|issue=2|page=510|pages=|via=Cornell University Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
The expenditure caps provide a [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] for non-profit organizations engaging in policy advocacy.  Because the limitation is expressed solely in terms of dollar amounts, organizations can effectively perform a large amount of lobbying if it is done through [[Volunteering|volunteer labor]] or through inexpensive media such as [[email]] or [[website]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  However, the 501(h) election is not advantageous for very large non-profits whose lobbying expenditures exceed the $1,000,000 total cap or the $250,000 grassroots lobbying cap.  These organizations may still be able to justify the expenditures as insubstantial if their operating budget is much larger, although it does entail increased risk.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Multiple commentators have called non-profit lobbying beneficial because it balances lobbying by for-profit corporations.  [[Tufts University]] political science professor Jeffrey Berry wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that, given that many non-profits are health care or social service providers, "they are the foot soldiers in a largely private system that delivers critical services to the disadvantaged. They are often closer to the problems—and the solutions—than the policymakers in city halls, state capitals and Washington."&lt;ref name="lobbyinglaw3" /&gt;  In initially enacting the provision, Congress intended to increase the flow of information from non-profits to the legislative process.  Senator [[Edmund Muskie]] said of an early version of a lobbying reform bill in 1971 that "it is fundamental to our constitutional system that [tax-exempt organizations] should have equal access along with business groups and others in presenting views to Congress."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nevertheless, as of 2009, only 1.3 percent of eligible 501(c)(3) organizations had taken the 501(h) election according to one count.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manny|first=Jill S.|year=2012|title=Nonprofit Legislative Speech: Aligning Policy, Law, and Reality|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1267&amp;context=caselrev|journal=Case Western Reserve Law Review|volume=62|issue=3|pages=772–773, 780–781, 788|via=CWRU School of Law Scholarly Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2003 survey of non-profits found a widespread but erroneous belief that non-profit organizations were banned from political advocacy of any sort, with little awareness of the 501(h) election.&lt;ref name="lobbyinglaw3" /&gt;  This was attributed to the long gap between the provision's enactment by Congress in 1976 and the publications of final rules by the IRS in 1990 and the complexity of the 501(h) provisions,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as the IRS's lack of interest in publicizing the provision.&lt;ref name="lobbyinglaw3" /&gt;

A 2013 survey of executive directors of non-profit organizations in [[Boston]] found that the organizations were 6.3 times more likely to engage in policy advocacy if they had taken a 501(h) election than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacIndoe|first=Heather|last2=Whalen|first2=Ray|year=2013|title=Specialists, Generalists, and Policy Advocacy by Charitable Nonprofit Organizations|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/jssw/vol40/iss2/8/|journal=Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare|volume=40|issue=2|pages=129, 137|via=University of Western Michigan ScholarWorks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Barber Conable.jpg|thumb|Representative [[Barber Conable]] introduced the 501(h) election as part of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1976]].|alt=A headshot of Representative Barber Conable, a man in his 50s wearing a suit and thick-rimmed glasses]]

=== Background ===
Lobbying restrictions on non-profits date to [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] regulations in 1919.&lt;ref name="lobbyinglaw3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2003/11/30/the-lobbying-law-is-more-charitable-than-they-think/d0c3660d-6e51-48c4-b3f9-7403a4dac98b/|title=The Lobbying Law Is More Charitable Than They Think|last=Berry|first=Jeffrey M.|date=November 30, 2003|work=The Washington Post|page=B1|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations denied tax-exempt status to organizations that engaged in "dissemination of controversial propaganda," which included political advocacy.  In the influential 1930 case ''Slee v. Commissioner'', the [[American Birth Control League]]'s tax-exempt status was revoked due to its publication of a magazine supporting the repeal of birth control laws, despite its other charitable activities.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Sullivan|first=Thomas W.|title=Defining the limits of lobbying activity for IRS Code 501 (c) (3) organizations|date=1994|degree=MPA|publisher=University of Montana|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9590&amp;context=etd|doi=|type=|docket=|oclc=|access-date=December 4, 2016|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The substantial part test was enacted as part of the [[Revenue Act of 1934]].  One justification given for this limitation was that donating money to influence legislation was "selfish" and not charitable if it enhanced the donors' personal interests, although the lack of a total ban on lobbying implied that non-selfish lobbying could be permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Manny, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent cases important to political advocacy by non-profits include ''[[Murray Seasongood|Seasongood]] v. Commissioner'', ''[[Speiser v. Randall]]'', and ''[[Cammarano v. United States]]''.  In 1966, the [[Sierra Club]]'s tax-exempt status was revoked in a high-profile case due to its publications of advertisements in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opposing the construction of dams in the [[Grand Canyon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, pp. 16–19, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enactment ===
The 501(h) election was enacted in the [[Tax Reform Act of 1976]] which was introduced by Representative [[Barber Conable]], after several attempts to introduce various similar provisions beginning in 1969.  There were several justifications given for the mechanics of the new option: correcting the vagueness of the substantial part test; ensuring that small organizations were not more restricted than large ones; providing a tax penalty for initial infractions rather than immediate loss of tax-exempt status; and increasing the lobbying influence of non-profit organizations relative to for-profit ones, the later of which were at the time able to deduct their lobbying expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Manny, pp. 769–772, 776.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRS regulations implementing the specifics of the 501(h) election were not finalized until 1990.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lobbyinglaw3" /&gt;  An initial 1987 proposal of regulations was criticized for being overly broad in what constituted grassroots lobbying, such as including mention of legislation in a fundraising letter, or allowing audience members at public forums to publicly express opinions about legislation, which would cause the entire cost of these activities to be applied as lobbying expenses.  The public reaction to the proposed regulations lead to a [[United States congressional hearing|congressional hearing]] in the [[United States House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight|House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight]] in March 1987, followed by the establishment of an advisory board within the IRS to revise the proposed regulations.  The final 1990 regulations were less stringent, excluding fundraising communications from lobbying activities and establishing the four-year window for violations before tax-exempt status would be revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, pp. 39–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3822">The '''Anglo-Thai Non-Aggression Pact''' was concluded in [[Bangkok]] on 12 June 1940 between the governments of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Kingdom of Thailand]]. It was concluded as part of the British policy at that time of refraining from resisting by force the actions of the [[Japanese Empire]] in East Asia, as Thailand was about to become Japan's ally.

Ratifications were exchanged in Bangkok on 31 August 1940 and the pact became effective on the same day. It was designated to remain in force for five years, unless extended. The pact was registered in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on 6 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 203, pp. 422-432.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Following the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, British policy in East Asia was in a state of confusion. The British government opposed Japanese expansionist policies, but at this point was not in a position to take up arms against the Japanese actions, especially following the [[Tientsin Incident]]. As a result, it developed a policy of not recognizing legally the changes made by Japanese actions, but at the same time refraining from antagonizing the Japanese government by actual resistance. This policy became evident in the so-called [[Craigie-Arita formula]] of July 1939, by which the British government refrained from open opposition to Japanese military actions in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/jul/24/far-east-situation Neville Chamberlain's speech in Parliament announcing the formula, July 24, 1939]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,761775,00.html "JAPAN-GREAT BRITAIN: Formula" ''Time'', July 31, 1939]&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation continued following the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in Europe in September 1939. On 18 July 1940 the British government accepted the Japanese demands for closing the [[Burma Road]] for three months to prevent war supplies to China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1940/jul/18/transit-of-war-material-to-china#S5CV0363P0_19400718_HOC_238 Churchill's announcement in Parliament about agreement to close the Burma Road]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government of Thailand was now becoming aligned with the Japanese Empire. During the battle of France (May–June 1940), the British government became extremely cautious in this policy, and concluded that pact with Bangkok so as not to antagonize Tokyo.

==Terms==
Article 1 stipulated the British and Thai governments would not resort to war against each other.

Article 2 provided for the termination of the pact if the British or the Thai governments committed an act of aggression against a third party.

Article 3 annulled any previous obligation by the British or the Thai governments to assist a third party in a war against another.

Article 4 stipulated that nothing in the pact annulled legal obligations that arose from the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]].

Article 5 had the two governments undertake not to disrupt each other's control over its territories.

Article 6 provided for the ratification of the pact.

{{Tort law}}
'''Assumption of risk''' is a [[defense (legal)|defense]] in the [[law]] of [[tort]]s, which bars or reduces a [[plaintiff]]'s right to recovery against a negligent [[tortfeasor]] if the [[defendant]] can demonstrate that the plaintiff voluntarily and knowingly assumed the risks at issue inherent to the dangerous activity in which he was participating at the time of his or her injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargo|first1=John F.|title=Comparative Fault: A Need for Reform of Indiana Tort Law|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=1978|volume=11|page=832|url=https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/inlawrev/article/viewFile/2310/2192|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is usually meant by assumption of risk is more precisely termed ''primary'' or "express" assumption of risk. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the [[duty]] to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability on the theory that upon assumption of the risk, there is no longer a [[duty of care]] running from the defendant to the plaintiff; without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on his part.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight v. Jewett'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/3C4t296.htm 3 Cal. 4th 296], 314-315 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, primary assumption of risk is not a blanket exemption from liability for the operators of a dangerous activity.  The ''specific'' risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply.  Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''Cheong v. Antablin'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/16C4t1063.htm 16 Cal. 4th 1067] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;  

This defense is commonly asserted in cases of injuries occurring during risky recreational activities, such as skiing, paragliding, and scuba diving, but actually extends to all dangerous activities.  Thus, for example, it was held that a visitor to the [[Burning Man]] festival assumed the risk of getting [[burn]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;''Beninati v. Black Rock City, LLC'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/175CA4t650.htm 175 Cal. App. 4th 650] (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Secondary'' assumption of risk is a rather different doctrine akin in some respects to [[comparative negligence]]. The difference was explained by the Supreme Court of California as follows: 

{{cquote|In cases involving 'primary assumption of risk'—where, by virtue of the nature of the activity and the parties' relationship to the activity, the defendant owes no legal duty to protect the plaintiff from the particular risk of harm that caused the injury—the doctrine continues to operate as a complete bar to the plaintiff's recovery. In cases involving 'secondary assumption of risk'—where the defendant does owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, but the plaintiff proceeds to encounter a known risk imposed by the defendant's breach of duty—the doctrine is merged into the comparative fault scheme, and the trier of fact, in apportioning the loss resulting from the injury, may consider the relative responsibility of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Knight'', 3 Cal. 4th at 314-315.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Administration of the Autonomous Communities''', also known as '''Autonomous Administration''', is a [[Public Administration of Spain]]. It belongs to the second level of the Public Administrations, because it exerts its powers within the limits of each [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]].

It is integrated by:

* Central Organization (Government of the Autonomous Community or Council of Government, the President of the Autonomous Communities, the Vicepresident and the Councilors).
* Peripheral Administration (Territorial Delegations of the Autonomous Communities, Sectoral Delegations of the Government Departments).

The Autonomic Administration has a very broad level of competence, based on the [[decentralization |decentralization]] of the State or through the State of Autonomies. As for the level of competences, they are not always the same, and are regulated in each [[Statute of Autonomy]] for each [[Autonomous Community]], making in some cases the level of competences is higher than those of a [[Federal state]].

It should also be taken into account that the Autonomous Community has its own [[legislative body]], and that the autonomous administration must behave before it like any other [[executive power]], respecting the rules issued by its autonomous parliament.

In the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] it is regulated in Chapter Three, entitled "of the Autonomous Communities". This Chapter regulates the form of creation and authorization of the Autonomous Communities, the elaboration of its Statutes, the powers transferred to the Autonomous Communities, the powers of the State, its resources and its financing.

==Structure==
Like the [[General State Administration]], the Autonomous Administration is regulated by Law 40/2015 and the structure is practically the same.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2015-10566 Ley 40/2015, de 1 de octubre, de Régimen Jurídico del Sector Público.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can vary from one Autonomous Community to another depending on the provisions in the Statute of Autonomy. Here the common organs are exposed:

===Central Organization===
====Government====
The Autonomous Government is the executive power of the [[Autonomous community of Spain|Autonomous Community]]. As in the [[Government of Spain|Central Government]] it responds before its [[parliament]] (autonomic parliament). The Government directs the Autonomous Administration within its competences. 

Contrary to what happens with the Central Government, the decisions taken by the Executive are not sanctioned by the [[King of spain|King]], and it is the President of the Autonomous Community who signs the laws and decisions on his behalf.

====President====
The President of the Autonomous Community is the head of the executive power as well as the highest authority of the Autonomous Community. He directs the Autonomous Government, elects its Vice President and Councilors and decides the policies that the government carries out.

As at the State level, the President may elect more than one Vice President and may freely separate his Vice-Presidents and Councilors. If the President is ceased, they cease with him.

====Councilors====
The Councilors of the Autonomous Community are like the [[Minister (government)|Ministers]] of the Central Government. They lead a ''Consejería'' (government department as a [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]]). Councilor work in their governamental area and appoint the members of their department like Vice Councilors, General Directors...etc

The figure of the Vice Councilor or Deputy Councilor is not always present, because it is the decision of the Councilor to exist or not this position and, in Autonomous Communities of small size where the work is not much, often these positions do not exist.

====General Directors====
The General Directorates are management departmental bodies and steering bodies, hierarchically inferior to the Councilors or Vice Councirlos (if they exist). The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent. It should be noted that the Royal Decree on the structure of the Department may omit the first requirement because it is a General Directorate whose exceptional characteristics require that the holder does not have the status of official of the State.

====Cabinets====
They are consultation bodies generally composed of a technical secretary and several technicians who support the President, Vicepresident, Councilors, ect. in their relations with institutions, in making decisions and performing special advisory tasks in a particular branch of knowledge.

===Peripheral Administration===
====Territorial Delegations====
The Territorial Delegations of the Autonomous Communities carry out the same activity as the Delegations of the Central Government. They are administrative bodies whose head is a high position appointed in the discretion of the Autonomous Government. He is in charge of the management of the Autonomous Administration in some of the territorial divisions of the Autonomous Communities, such as the [[Provinces of Spain|Province]].

====Sectoral Delegations====
The Sectoral Delegations of the Consejerías are organs that represent the different Departments of an autonomous government. The holder must have a degree of competence and professional experience, and will be selected from career officials of the State, Autonomous Communities or Local entities, also demanding the title of Doctor, Licensee, Engineer, Architect or equivalent

==Origin==

Named for historian and diplomat [[George Bancroft]] (1800–1891), who negotiated the first of these agreements with [[Prussia]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation  |last= |first= |year=1873 |contribution= Convention between the United States of America and the King of Prussia, Relative to Naturalization, Concluded at Berlin, February 22, 1868, Ratifications Exchanged May 8, 1868, Proclaimed by the President of the United States, May 27, 1868 |title= Treaties and Convention between the United States and Other Powers, Since July 4, 1776, Revised Edition |publisher=  Government Printing Office   |place= Washington, DC |volume=  |url= https://archive.org/stream/cu31924005227727#page/n645/mode/2up |pages= 638 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bancroft [[treaty|treaties]] were mainly intended to prevent individuals from using naturalization as a way to avoid military service and other legal obligations in their native countries.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation  |last=Yeaman|first=George H.  |year=1867 |title= Allegiance and Citizenship, An Inquiry into the Claim of European Governments to Exact Military Service of the Naturalized Citizens of the United States  |publisher= Printed Fritz Moller |place=Copenhagen |volume= |url= https://archive.org/stream/allegianceandci02yeamgoog#page/n6/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_83.pdf Roberto Cordova, Special Rapporteur, "Nationality Including Statelessness: Report on Multiple Nationality," United Nations, ''Yearbook of the International Law Commission'', Volume II, p. 44, New York, 1954 (A/CN.4/83).]  See also [https://books.google.com/books?id=MSLgiCvfKXQC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Bancroft+treaties&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2fyK9nAJPC&amp;sig=B41VS9TbfLZI-G5YgZApmBODFGE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rucRStzZIovEM-30wYUN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Manfred Jonas, ''The United States and Germany: A Diplomatic History'', Cornell University Press, 1985, pp. 25-26.]  {{ISBN|0-8014-9890-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1868 to 1937, the United States entered into 25 Bancroft treaties covering 34 foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;There were bilateral treaties with Albania, Austria-Hungary, Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, Costa Rica, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, El Salvador, Haiti, Hesse, Honduras, Lithuania, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, Prussia, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Uruguay and Wurttemberg.  For the text of the treaty with Great Britain see {{Citation  |last= |first= |year=1873 |contribution= Convention between the United States of America and Great Britain, Relative to Naturalization, Concluded May 13, 1870, Ratifications Exchanged August 10, 1870, Proclaimed by the President of the United States, September 16, 1870 |title= Treaties and Convention between the United States and Other Powers, Since July 4, 1776, Revised Edition |publisher=  Government Printing Office   |place= Washington, DC |volume=  |url= https://archive.org/stream/cu31924005227727#page/n411/mode/2up |pages= 405 }}. Norway and Sweden were included in a single treaty signed in 1869 when the two countries were joined in a personal union under the Swedish monarchy.  The Interamerican Convention of 1906 covered Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Panama and Uruguay.   For the text of the 1906 Inter-American Convention see {{Citation  |last= |first= |year=1968 |contribution= Status of Naturalized Persons who Return to Country Of Origin (Inter-American), Convention signed at Rio de Janeiro, August 13, 1906 |title= Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States 1776-1949 (compiled under the direction of Charles.

The treaties with each of the German states except Prussia became obsolete when the [[German Empire]] was proclaimed in 1871.  The treaties with Prussia and Austria-Hungary lapsed with the American declaration of war in 1917 and were never revived.  Brazil, Mexico and the United Kingdom terminated their treaties; and Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay withdrew from the 1906 convention.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the 1937 Treaty with Lithuania see {{Citation  |last= |first= |year=1972 |contribution= Liability for Military Service of Naturalized Persons and Persons born with Double Nationality |title= Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States 1776-1949 (compiled under the direction of Charles.

The first specified the terms under which each party would recognize the naturalization of its citizens by the other.  (Five years' uninterrupted residence in the adopted country was the usual requirement.)  The second provided that naturalized citizens who returned to their native country could be prosecuted for crimes that they allegedly committed before they emigrated.  The third and most important provided that naturalized citizens who returned to their country of origin and stayed there for two continuous years would be presumed to have resumed their former nationality.  That would require them to meet any unfulfilled military service obligation in their native country and deny them the [[diplomatic protection]] of their adopted one.  Article III of the 1908 treaty with [[Portugal]] was typical:

{{quote|If a Portuguese subject naturalized in America, renews his residence in Portugal, without intent to return to America, he shall be held to have renounced his naturalization in the United States.  Reciprocally, if an American naturalized in Portugal renews his residence in the United States, without intent to return to Portugal, he shall be held to have renounced his naturalization in Portugal.

The intent not to return may be held to exist when the person naturalized in one country resides more than two years in the other country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AUnited_States_Statutes_at_Large_Volume_35_Part_2.djvu&amp;page=924 35 U.S. Statutes at Large 2082, 2083]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{Citation  |last= |first= |year=1974 |title= Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States 1776-1949 (compiled under the direction of Charles.

==Constitutional infirmity==

{{Wikisourcepar|Reid v. Covert (354 U.S. 1)}}
{{Wikisourcepar|Trop v. Dulles}}
{{Wikisourcepar|Schneider v. Rusk (377 U.S. 163)}}
{{Wikisourcepar|Afroyim v. Rusk}}

Conceived in an era when the right of individuals to change their citizenship was not universally recognized, the Bancroft treaties represented an important step forward in securing recognition by foreign governments of the right of their nationals to become American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the legal doctrine of "perpetual allegiance" of subjects to their sovereign and the role of the Bancroft treaties in hastening its decline, see 
[http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/alumni/uvalawyer/sp05/martin_lecture.htm David A. Martin, ''Dual Nationality: TR’s "Self-Evident Absurdity"''', Chair Lecture, October 27, 2004, University of Virginia School of Law.]&lt;/ref&gt;  But American [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] law eventually made the treaties obsolete.

In ''[[Schneider v. Rusk]]'', 377 U.S. 163 (1964), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] invalidated a section of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] (the McCarran-Walter Act) that would strip naturalized Americans of their citizenship after ''three'' years' continuous residence in their country of origin; and in ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'', 387 U.S. 253 (1967), the Supreme Court, reviewing part of the Nationality Act of 1940, held that [[United States Congress|Congress]] has no power to strip anyone of their citizenship, whether it is acquired by birth or by naturalization.  These decisions strongly suggested that any future case of involuntary loss of citizenship under one of the Bancroft treaties probably would not survive a Supreme Court challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1200apA.html#M1270 "Naturalization Treaties"].  7 [[Foreign Affairs Manual|FAM]] 1270, Appendix A (d).  [[United States Department of State]].  Retrieved December 16, 2015.  "In the matter of Reid v. Covert, ... the U.S. Supreme Court established that provisions of treaties or executive agreements are unenforceable if they conflict with the Constitution....  [''Schneider v. Rusk'' and ''Afroyim v. Rusk''] strongly implied that if a case of involuntary loss of citizenship under one of the Bancroft treaties came before the Supreme Court, the expatriation provisions would be found unconstitutional."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Termination of the Bancroft treaties==

Concluding that the Bancroft treaties were unenforceable, the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]], acting in consultation with the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], gave notice in 1980 terminating the treaties&lt;ref&gt;For termination of the naturalization treaties with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Lithuania, Nicaragua, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Uruguay see [https://archive.org/stream/departmentofstatd8080unit#page/78/mode/2up ''Department of State Bulletin'', v. 80, no. 2045, December 1980, pp. 79-80]; And for termination of the naturalization treaties with Denmark and Sweden see [https://archive.org/stream/departmentofstata8181unit#page/n101/mode/2up ''Department of State Bulletin'' v. 81, no. 2046, January 1981, pp. 39-40 .]&lt;/ref&gt;  with 18 of the 21 countries&lt;ref&gt;Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Lithuania, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Sweden and Uruguay.  Delivery of the termination notice to the Lithuanian consulate in Washington, DC, gave the United States an opportunity to emphasize that it did not recognize the incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union.&lt;/ref&gt; with which they were still in force.  The exceptions were the treaties with [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].  The treaty with Albania was terminated in 1991 when Albania and the United States re-established diplomatic relations at the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1584/is_n14_v2/ai_11161764   FindArticles - Treaty actions: March-April 1991, US Department of State Dispatch, April 8, 1991.]&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic as successor states to the former Czechoslovakia was terminated by the United States in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/acda/state/tifjan97.pdf U.S. Department of State: Treaties in Force as of January 1, 1997, p. 66 at col. 2.].

'''Licensing''' means renting or leasing of an [[intangible asset]]. It is a process of creating and managing [[contracts]] between the owner of a [[brand]] and a company or individual who wants to  use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. Licensing is used by brand owners to extend a [[trademark]] or character onto products of a completely different nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Integrated Intellectual Asset Management|first= Steve|last= Manton|year=2005|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-566-08721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of intangible assets include a song ("Somewhere Over The Rainbow"), a character ([[Donald Duck]]), a name ([[Michael Jordan]]), or a brand (The [[Ritz-Carlton]]). An arrangement to license a brand requires a licensing agreement. A licensing agreement authorizes a company which markets a product or service (a licensee) to lease or rent a brand from a brand owner who operates a licensing program (a licensor).&lt;ref name="Brand Licensing Expert"&gt;[http://www.brandlicensingexpert.com BrandLicensingExpert.com Peter Canalichio, Licensing Brands, Inc. CEO]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Brand licensing is a well-established business, both in the area of [[patent]]s and trademarks. Trademark licensing has a rich history in American business, largely beginning with the rise of mass entertainment such as the movies, comics and later television. [[Mickey Mouse]]'s popularity in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in an explosion of toys, books, and consumer products with the lovable rodent's likeness on them, none of which were manufactured by the Walt Disney Company.

This process accelerated as movies and later television became a staple of American business. The rise of brand licensing did not begin until much later, when corporations found that consumers would actually pay money for products with the logos of their favorite brands on them. [[McDonald's]] play food, [[Burger King]] T-shirts and even ghastly [[Good Humor]] Halloween costumes became commonplace. [[Brand extension]]s later made the brand licensing marketplace much more lucrative, as companies realized they could make real dollars renting out their equity to manufacturers. Instead of spending untold millions to create a new brand, companies were willing to pay a royalty on net sales of their products to ''rent'' the product of an established brand name. [[Armor All]] auto vacuums, [[Breyers]] yogurt, [[TGI Friday's]] frozen appetizers, and [[Lucite]] nail polish are only a handful of the products carrying well-known brand names which are made under license by companies unrelated to the companies who own the brand.

== Reasons for licensing ==
A company may choose to license its brand(s) when they believe there is strong consumer acceptance for [[brand extensions]] or products. For example, when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] launched the iPod there was an immediate need for accessories such as headphones, charging and syncing stations and carrying cases. Apple decided not to manufacture these products and instead chose to have a [[licensee]] make the products. By doing so, Apple could offer branded "Earbud Headphones", "iPod docking stations" and "iPod socks." Each is made by a separate company but together offer the consumer an elegant solution. All of these accessories are sold by licensees.

Apart from benefits to licensors, there are benefits to licensees as well. Licensees lease the rights to a brand for incorporation into their [[merchandise]], but do not share ownership in it. Having access to major national and global brands, and the logos and trademarks associated with those brands, gives the licensee significant benefits. The most important of these is the marketing power the brand brings to the licensee’s products. When brand managers enter or extend into new product categories via licensing they create an opportunity for a licensee to grow their company. Below is an example of the licensed product process steps:

* Licensor chooses the product categories to be licensed   
* Licensor finds and negotiates a license with the best licensees   
* Licensees develop concepts, prototypes and final production samples and submit for approval   
* Licensor approves licensed products for sale   
* Licensees sell licensed products to authorized retailers&lt;ref name="Marketing Professors"&gt;[http://www.marketingprofs.com/authors/971/pete-canalichio MarketingProfessors.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensees expect that the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth may be in the form of growth within existing market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees expect that the brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract obligations. [[Royalties]] are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales.&lt;ref name="Atlanta Business Radio"&gt;[http://atlantabusinessradio.businessradiox.com/atlanta-business-radio-interviews-swine-flu-expert-dr-elaina-george-brand-licensing-expert-pete-canalichio-and-batteries-plus-owner-john-cyphers/ Atlanta Business Radio Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global brand licensing industry ==

The main international [[professional association]] for brand licensing is the [[Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association]], which sponsors the annual Licensing International Expo.

The Society of Product Licensors Committed to Excellence  (SPLiCE) is a Licensors Community of Practice with the vision to continuously improve brand licensing. The mission of SPLiCE is to act as a community of licensors who share best practices for protecting, promoting and enhancing brand integrity. The SPLiCE Licensors Workshop acts as its annual board of directors and members' meeting. During SPLiCE Licensors Workshop, benchmark findings and industry trends are highlighted in feature panel presentations that are relevant to the community at large. They engage a creativity philosophy of divergence and convergence to sustain unique idea implementation on best practices. The vision for SPLiCE Licensors Workshop is to provide best in practice licensing education through sharing educational best practices through benchmarking initiatives, task force collaborations, committee reports, and guest industry speakers

Each May, ''License! Global'' magazine publishes an annual list of "The Top 150 Global Licensors". For 2017, the leader was [[Disney Consumer Products]] with $53 billion in retail sales of licensed merchandise, followed by [[Meredith Corp.]] with $23.2 Billion and [[PVH (company)|PVH]] with $18 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|title=Top 150 Global Licensors|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/top-150-global-licensors-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association (LIMA), global licensed merchandise sales was $272.2 billion in 2016, versus $262.2 billion in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Michael |last2=Ames |first2=Allison |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-viewpoint/licensing-expo-2017-8-trends-263-billion-industry/309209/ |title=8 Trends Ahead for the $263 Billion Licensing Industry |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=2017-06-01 |accessdate=2017-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brand licensing in India ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1992 brought a slew of international brands to India. Many of these brands have been licensed to Indian companies. [[Arvind_(company)| Arvind]] represent Arrow, Cherokee, ELLE, Nautica, USPA, AEROPOSTALE, CHILDRENS PLACE, Ed Hardy, GAP and Kipling. The [[Murjani Group]] is the licensee for Calvin Klein Jeans, FCUK and Tommy Hilfiger. Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC) is licensed to Spencers Retail. 

Character Licensing is another big licensing segment of brand licensing in India. The big players in the character licensing industry in India are [[Disney India]], [[Viacom 18]] and [[Cartoon Network Enterprises]]. Characters licensed out by Disney India include [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. Viacom has brought in popular characters from [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] like [[Dora The Explorer]] and [[SpongeBob SquarePants]]. Cartoon Network boasts of a portfolio including characters such as [[Ben 10]], [[Powerpuff Girls]], [[Mr. Bean]], [[Roll no. 21]], [[We Bare Bears]].

== Brand licensing in Italy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
Brand Licensing in [[Italy]] started in the seventies with very few Licensing Agencies. Apart from Disney which had its own dedicated office in the market, all the other big Entertainment majors were represented by independent agencies. One of these companies named DIC 2 (Distribution International Characters), founded in 1973 by Gianfranco Mari contributed to create the licensing business in Italy and set big phenomena as [[He-Man]] and the Masters of the Universe, [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[Hanna &amp; Barbera]] characters, [[Zorro]], [[Asterix]] and so on. DIC 2 is still one of the biggest independent agencies in Italy, representing different cartoon characters and famous brands.

In Australia, '''celebrants''' are people who conduct formal ceremonies in the community, particularly weddings, which are the main ceremony of legal import conducted by celebrants. They may also conduct extra-legal ceremonies such as [[Naming ceremony|naming]] of babies, [[Wedding vow renewal ceremony|renewal of wedding vows]] and funerals. Officiating at a marriage requires that the celebrant be an authorised marriage celebrant under Australian law, but officiating at extra-legal ceremonies does not.

==Marriage celebrants==
{{See also|Marriage officiant}}
Many Western nations permit celebrants who are not clergy to carry out basic, legal, marriage ceremonies. However Australia was the first nation whose government appointed non-clergy celebrants with the specific intention that they would create ceremonies that might be as culturally enriching and, if required, as formal as church weddings, i.e. that these ceremonies would not be inferior in status to religious weddings.

An "authorised celebrant" is a person who is authorised (registered) by the [[Australian Government]] to perform legal marriages according to the [[Marriage Act 1961 (Australia)|Marriage Act 1961]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ma196185/index.html MARRIAGE ACT 1961&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2001-02/02bd112.htm Marriage Amendment Bill 2002 Bills Digest 112 2001–02&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327122219/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/bd/2001-02/02bd112.htm |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrant may be a representative of a [[religion|religious organisation]] (known as a religious marriage celebrant) or someone providing secular or non-religious weddings (known as a '''civil marriage celebrant'''). Only authorised (registered) marriage celebrants have the authority to perform marriages in Australia.

In 2017, 78 per cent of Australian marriages were performed by civil celebrants. However, the rate of civil marriages varied between states and territories, with a civil marriage rate of 86.6% in the Northern Territory, 83.6% in Tasmania, 81.7% in Western Australia, 81.2% in Queensland, 77.8% in South Australia, 77.3% in Victoria, 76.6% in the Australian Capital Territory and 75% in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3310.0Main+Features12017?OpenDocument|title=3310.0 - Marriages and Divorces, Australia, 2017 - Marriages |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 November 2018 |website= abs.gov.au |publisher= Australian Bureau of Statistics |access-date= 27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage by independent civil celebrant has spread in other English-speaking countries. Its early establishment in Australia was largely due to the support of the reforming Attorney-General [[Lionel Murphy]] in the 1970s.

==Descriptive definition==
A civil marriage celebrant is a private person authorised by the relevant government to perform legal civil marriages in a dignified and culturally acceptable manner, for those who do not choose a religious ceremony.

Civil celebrants also serve people who have religious beliefs but do not wish to be married in a church, temple or mosque. In contrast to the established ceremonies of religious or registry office authorities, in celebrant ceremonies many decisions about the content are chosen by the couple. Therefore, the civil celebrant has come to be defined as a professionally trained ceremony-provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client couple. The task may be like an architect who is charged with designing a dream home for a couple who need expert help.&lt;ref name="Dally Messenger 2009"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Articles/keynote_afcc09.html|title=The Power of an Idea: the History of Celebrancy|accessdate=2012-12-30|publisher=International College of Celebrancy|year=2009|author=[[Dally Messenger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense the celebrant is not just the one who performs the ceremony according to law, but its facilitator, the couple's adviser, the resource person, the co-creator of the ceremony, and the rehearsal-director.

Therefore, the celebrant does not come from the standpoint of belief or unbelief. Trained celebrants usually operate professionally on the principle that their own beliefs and values are irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Messenger, Dally.

*The 1960s in Australia was a decade of questioning established institutions and of profound social change.
*There was extreme dissatisfaction with the marriage "registry offices" of the time. Couples, who could not or would not use clerical celebrants, were humiliated by perfunctory and undignified ceremonies. The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches, the major denominations of the time, discouraged or forbad remarriage of divorced people; and the offensively dismissive marriages offered by the state in registry offices often seemed designed to add to the distress of couples who were defying their own church's rules.&lt;ref name="Dally Messenger 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quote "The Catholic partner of a mixed marriage promises to do everything possible to preserve the faith and have all children of the marriage baptised and brought up in the Catholic Church." in the "Penny Catechism" (Catechism of Christian Doctrine)(1850–1970) – a summary doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church.{{Cite web|url=http://www.proecclesia.com/penny%20catechism/index.htm|title=A Catechism of Christian Doctrine|accessdate=2013-01-22|publisher=Incorporated Catholic Truth Society – London|year=|author=[[The Catholic Church]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There was dissatisfaction with the main Catholic denominations of the time, especially the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches, predominantly with regard to the treatment of divorced persons and of those choosing partners of other denominations ("mixed marriages").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1042&amp;context=creartspapers|title=Not in front of the altar – Mixed marriages and sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants in pre-multicultural Australia|accessdate=2013-01-22|publisher=University of Wollongong-Faculty of Law, Humanities and the Arts|date=2009|author=S.A.McHugh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*There were strong [and sometimes militant] objections to marriage and the marriage ceremony wording by feminists.&lt;ref&gt;A number of the feminist writers depicted marriage as a state oppressive to women e.g.Greer, Germaine, quoting Forum Vol 2, no.3, in The Female Eunuch, Paladin, London, 1971 p.199 :see also Segal, Iza, "The Immorality of Marriage", The Australian Humanist, December 1969, p.7: see also Norma Grieve and Ailsa Burns (eds), Australian Women-Contemporary Feminist Thought, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1994 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;
*National census figures showed an increasing percentage of people declaring themselves "No religion".&lt;ref&gt;See the excellent graph, entitled "Major religious affiliations described in Australian censuses" in [[Christianity in Australia]]. Note the almost exclusive dominance of Christianity, especially Roman Catholic and Anglican (ca 60%) in Australia in the years 1971–1976, and the dramatic increase of the ''No religion/Not stated'' category to 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Divorces, though common, were expensive, traumatic, and involved legal apportioning of blame. This indirectly tainted the institution of marriage.&lt;ref name="Messenger III 2012"&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}} p.24ff&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of civil celebrancy in Australia==
[[File:Lois D'Arcy 1.png|thumb|by Lois D'Arcy|Mrs Lois D'Arcy was the first independent civil marriage celebrant ever appointed — by Attorney-General Lionel Murphy. Her appointment is dated 19 July 1973. This photo illustrates Murphy's radical move in appointing women into a hitherto male dominated profession, and his confidence in young people.

Civil celebrancy was established by the Australian Commonwealth Attorney General Lionel Murphy on 19 July 1973, when his first appointee, Mrs Lois D'Arcy, was categorised as a Civil Marriage Celebrant. Later, as civil marriage celebrants branched out into the performance of other ceremonies such as Funerals and Namings the term was shortened to Civil Celebrant.
According to civil celebrant [[Dally Messenger III]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The civil celebrant program is almost entirely the result of one man's vision. Murphy himself told me the story of how he was opposed by his own staff, the public service, his fellow members of parliament and officials of the Labour Party. He defied all, and, on July 19, 1973, in the dead of night, typed the first appointment himself, found the envelope and stamp, walked to a post box and posted it himself.&lt;ref name="Messenger, Dally. (2009)."&gt;{{cite speech |url= http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Articles/keynote_afcc09.html |title= The Power of an Idea: The History of Celebrancy |event= Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants Conference |date= July 13, 2009 |accessdate= 2012-11-22 |publisher= International College of Celebrancy |author= [[Dally Messenger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact the enabling legislation, the Marriage Act, had been passed in 1961 but Murphy's personal involvement in using the Act's powers and bypassing the bureaucracy made him a hero to the first civil celebrants. Lois D’Arcy, in a 1992 address to celebrants, recollected Murphy's own account of his authorising the first appointment:&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:First celebrant.jpg|thumb|alt=text|right|Mrs Lois D'Arcy, first independent civil marriage celebrant ever appointed by Attorney-General Lionel Murphy.

Lois D'Arcy was, at the time, a young mother of 26.]] --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(Lionel had) returned to his office one evening. There he had taken a piece of paper with his letterhead, typed my authorisation, and then placed it in an envelope, which he then posted to me. What other person in such a high position would have done such a thing. No one other than Lionel Murphy!&lt;ref name="D’Arcy, Lois. (1992)."&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/Articles/loisd'arcy1992.html |title= The Beginnings of Celebrancy |accessdate= 2012-11-22 |publisher= International College of Celebrancy |year=2009 |author= Lois D'Arcy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Murphy's stance on marriage reform (and on divorce reform) was part of wider desire to free Australians from restrictive laws. High Court Justice Michael Kirby remarked in 2000:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lionel Murphy was a big figure on the stage of Australian public life. He pursued with energy, imagination and determination a vision of Australian society which was not warped and gnarled and inward-looking. It was one which reached out to everyone, particularly the disadvantaged.&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Hocking, Jenny, 1997, Lionel Murphy – a Political Biography, Cambridge, Cambridge UK (and the Bibliography found in Hocking J., 1997) {{ISBN|0521 79485 4}}, p.vi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- WHAT TEXT ARE THE FOLLOWING REFS SUPPORTING? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackshield, A.R., Brown, D., Coper, M., and Krever, R.

==Lionel Murphy: radical achievements==
With regard to the marriage celebrant program – Dally Messenger III summarised Murphy’s achievement as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lionel Murphy was a real radical. I am still amazed at his vision. He shocked the system.

*His first shock to the social system was the appointment of women—at a moment in history when, for hundreds of years, the only ceremony providers were men. (Paradoxically this Murphy decision is commonly acknowledged as having substantially supported the women in the churches who wished to become priests and bishops.)
*His second shock to the social system was the appointment of aborigines as civil celebrants. Faith Bandler, I recall, was one. (They had only been counted as humans in the census some six years before.)
*His third shock was the appointment of young people to do ceremonies. Lois D’Arcy was a 26 year old mother of two babies. Carol Ditchburn, now Astbury. was 24.
*His next shock was that citizens could choose their own celebrant—unheard of until then, both with church and with state.
*His next shock, a now obvious truth but still not fully absorbed, was his assertion that celebrating the milestones of life was just as important for secular people as it was for religious people.
*His overwhelming conviction was his belief that culture matters—really matters.&lt;ref name="Messenger, Dally. (2009)."/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Messenger and D'Arcy (opera.cit), the pioneer civil celebrants believed they were part of an innovative cultural challenge. They developed a deeper understanding of the purposes of ceremony, and believed celebrants should pursue excellence in every ceremony and in a variety of ceremonies.

To raise the general standard of civil ceremonies, given what they saw as the excessively legal cultural context they had inherited, they encouraged each couple to see more creative possibilities in the ceremony than the two of them might originally have envisaged. In this context the celebrant, as a resource person, needed to educate himself/herself in the artistic treasures of western culture appropriate for ceremony creation i.e. in poetry, prose, music, choreography, storytelling and symbolism i.e. the components of ceremony.

Since the Federal Government introduced celebrants in 1973, the appointment has been valid at any time, in any place anywhere in Australia. Up to 2013, the Marriage Celebrant Program has enabled over a million couples to be married in civil ceremonies. Celebrants were originally appointed based on geographic location and the perceived need for a celebrant in the area, but after 2003 their appointment was dependent on being a bureaucratically approved "fit and proper person".

==Celebrant civil ceremonies distinct from civil ceremonies of the past==
The Code of Practice, a section of the Regulations under the Marriage Act 1961, and to which celebrants are legally bound, requires that celebrants help provide a client-centred ceremony. It further recommends the following high standards of ceremonial preparation and delivery:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a marriage celebrant must recognise the social, cultural and legal significance of marriage and the marriage ceremony...

a marriage celebrant must maintain a high standard of service in his or her professional conduct and practice...

a marriage celebrant must respect the importance of the marriage ceremony to the parties and the other persons organising the ceremony...

give the parties information and guidance to enable them to choose or compose a marriage ceremony that will meet their needs and expectations...

If requested by the parties conduct a marriage ceremony rehearsal...

Ensure that his or her personal presentation is of an appropriate standard for the marriage ceremony, and respect the expectations of the parties in relation to the ceremony...

make efforts to ensure that the marriage ceremony is audible to all those present (using audio equipment, if required)...

arrive at the venue for the marriage ceremony no later than the time agreed with the parties...

ensure that the parties to each marriage receive a level of service that meets their separate and special requirements...

accept evaluative comment from the parties, and use any comments to improve performance...&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General's Department, Marriage Regulations 1963,  ''Code of Practice for Marriage Celebrants'', Canberra, Reprint 3 October 27, 2003, pp.122–123 {{ISBN|1920838155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This distinguishes the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant and the countries which follow the Australian model, from previous experiences of civil marriage, or from pre-conceived notions, often held especially in the UK and the USA that a civil marriage must be short, dry legal and soul-less.

As is clear from the Australian Code of Practice quoted above, a couple can, and often do, require that their marriage ceremony have all the traditional structure, content, dress, choreography and flow of a formal church ceremony. And originally, civil celebrants were instructed that the readings, ideals, values, vows, music (lyrics) which are expressed, must be secular and non-religious. In April 1976 the Attorney's General's Department instructed civil celebrants as follows:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;All celebrants are urged to ensure that the ceremony they use is appropriate for a civil marriage. They are reminded that the service they provide is a secular alternative to religious services which are reserved for church marriages. It would be therefore be out of character for any religious significance to be given to the ceremony. For the same reasons, the conduct of a civil marriage in a church is not encouraged and, understandably, could be the subject of criticism by church authorities and the public generally.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney-Generals Department, Circular to all Private Persons authorised as Civil Marriage Celebrants, Canberra ACT, April 1976, p2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This admonition was repeated over ten years later (September 1986) in virtually the same words.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney-Generals Department, Information for Civil Marriage Celebrants, Canberra ACT, September 1986, p2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Nine years later this instruction was partially modified, and after the changes of 2003, when the same authorisation applied to clergy from small churches and civil celebrants the lines became completely blurred.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dally Messenger III also claims that as the ceremony is either chosen or created by the couple, it can be affirmed as honest and authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney), {{ISBN|978-0-7336-2317-2}} pp. 16ff&lt;/ref&gt;
Or to give an American perspective on marriage which illustrates a reformed view of civil marriage we need only quote the New Jersey civil marriage celebrant Gerald Fierst:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A wedding ceremony is a crossroad where two life stories intersect.

A wedding ceremony takes the two lives that the individuals have travelled and transforms them into a single path upon which each life embarks, starting over.

A wedding ceremony acknowledges the turning point, the choice to go on.

It's the setting off on life's journey together, with the experiences of the past as a guide into the future.

A wedding ceremony is a story which tells the past, proclaims the present, and blesses the future.&lt;ref&gt;Fierst, Gerald, The Heart of the Wedding, Parkhurst Brothers, Chicago, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-935166-22-1}} p.76ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cant, Sally, The Heart and Soul of Celebrancy – A Guide to Creating Memorable Ceremonies, Pennon Publishing, Melbourne 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-920997-13-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Gramberg, Ruth, The Practical Handbook for Celebrants to Welcome Celebrate and Farewell, Longueville Books, Woollahra (Australian Marriage Celebrants Inc), 2011, {{ISBN|978-0987066-0-84}} p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Or in the words of Author and Celebrant Wendy Haynes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When it comes down to it, the jewel in the crown is the wedding ceremony... The purpose of the book is to inspire you, to give you ideas so you can shape the ceremony to fit your life and your commitment to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes Wendy, Create Your Own Inspiring Wedding Ceremony, Wendy Haynes, Coffs Harbour, 2005, {{ISBN|0-9757338-0-X}} pp.1ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Celebrant organisations==
Lionel Murphy himself founded the first celebrant organisation on 3 May 1974. He called all the celebrants he had appointed to that date to his office in Sydney. He explained to the celebrants who were present that the Labor Party was sure to lose the coming election. Celebrants would need an organisation so that they could speak with one voice, especially if their very existence was threatened by a Conservative (Liberal) Government. He appointed a well-known model Jill-Ellen Fuller as the inaugural President of the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrants Association (ACMCA). He placed his own personal secretary Maureen Barron as temporary secretary but soon officially appointed Dally Messenger III.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, p57&lt;/ref&gt;

(A separate organisation for Funeral Celebrants, the Association of Civil Funeral Celebrants, was formed on 3 May 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, p159&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Dally messenger iii.jpg|thumb|Dally Messenger III is an acknowledged leader in the Civil Celebrant Program in Australia, New Zealand and the USA. He has written two influential books, one on secular ceremonies and another on the history of celebrancy. cf. reference 11 &amp; 25.]]
Apart from survival, the main activities of the ACMCA became to deal with the media, and to distribute and share (by mail) resources among the celebrants i.e. poems and quotations, for use in ceremonies.

Murphy exempted every civil celebrant from Section 45 of the Australian federal Marriage Act 1961. This is a legal "warning" or ''[[monitum]]'' to the couple. Murphy believed the words to be sexist and inauthentic – i.e. wrong for not admitting the high rate of divorce.

After several years the ACMCA broke up into state organisations. Other organisations such as the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants formed (28 January 1994) which admitted marriage, funeral and naming celebrants.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, p207&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fixed-fee period: 1974–1995==
Despite a number of difficulties and problems, the civil celebrant program turned out to be hugely popular with the general public.
From 1973 to 1995, civil marriages by independent celebrants went from 2.92% of total marriages to 38.5% in 1996.(If one includes Total Civil Marriages i.e. includes civil marriages performed by government "Registry Office" officials, total civil marriages went from 17.92% in 1974 to 46.7% in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, Year Book of Australia 1996, AGPS, Canberra. 1997 p.151 and Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1996 Marriages and Divorces Australia, Cat.No.3310.0, 1997, ABS, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt;
The main problem was the fixed fee which, strictly interpreted by Attorney-General’s Department ultimately led to a serious decline in standards from which the program has never fully recovered.&lt;ref&gt;An example of these declining standards there were many news reports e.g. The Sunday Observer (Melbourne),, 13 January 1980, ''Bride and Groom "Jilted" by celebrant''&lt;/ref&gt; Once the pioneer celebrants became diluted with new appointments idealism was only sustained by the minority. Attitudes developed with many celebrants which turned out to be very destructive. Realising they received the same remuneration if they spent time and care in the preparation of a marriage, or if they did not, many provided the absolute minimum for the marrying couple. To make matters worse, the fixed fee, in a period of high inflation, declined in value, which further exacerbated the problem.

Many good celebrants were forced out of the field due to the low remuneration. In the context of the fixed fee, those who stayed practising marriage celebrants did far too many marriages to earn enough remuneration for their personal needs.
Despite Lionel Murphy’s clear declarations to the contrary, some powerful public servants began to classify the office of marriage celebrant as a "community service" which led to a further deterioration of professional standards.

Says Messenger: &lt;blockquote&gt;''… the public service and the government had all but destroyed the Civil Marriage Celebrant Program by freezing the fee, forcing down standards and frustrating the good celebrants out of the business.''&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}} Chapter 42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite these debilitating policy initiatives, a minority core of celebrants sustained high standards. The program continued to progress and, at the end of 1995, was very close to becoming the mainstream procedure of contracting marriage.

==Deregulation period: 1995–2003==
According to Messenger&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally (2012), ''Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement'', Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}, Chapters 43–48&lt;/ref&gt; the period from 1995 to 2003 is recorded as being the most happily productive of the Civil Celebrant Movement in Australia.

Funeral and Naming ceremonies, originally opposed by the majority of celebrants and the Attorney-General's Department, had gradually and imperceptibly become accepted. A group of celebrants under the leadership of Rick Barclay, a successful Funeral and Marriage Celebrant, had morphed the original Funeral Celebrants Association of Australia into an organisation which accepted all ceremonies and celebrants into an inclusive association titled The Institute of Australian Celebrants.

Kathleen Hurley, an active member of the Institute, persuaded Dally Messenger III to become more deeply involved. Other activists at this time included Ken Woodburn, Lyn Knorr, Beverley Silvius, Gavan Grosser, Cavell Ferrier and Brian and Tina McInerney. As a group, they decided to escalate the profile of the Institute and take a lead in bringing all celebrants together.  They also devised a plan for regular meetings and conferences to encourage co-operation, professional development, and to focus on a deeper understanding of the role of the celebrant in society.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, No. 01 to No 14. 29 March 1994, to 1 January 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Their most important decision was to mount a political and media campaign to abolish the fixed fee, perceived as the cause of the lowest standards since the program was established. With these ends, on 28 January. 1994, the institute became a national organisation, the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants Inc.

Before challenging government, they campaigned for more members and organised a series meetings and seminars. Shortly after, on 28 March 1994 Dally Messenger, the president of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants joined with Robert Ross, secretary of the Association of Civil Marriage Celebrants of Victoria in a meeting with the Honorable Peter Duncan, the assistant minister in charge of celebrants, and asked him for the deregulation of the fee for marriages, and a number of other reforms.

Duncan, after several months of correspondence,  responded negatively by appointing 1000 extra celebrants.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Catherine, ''Sunday Herald Sun'', 5 Feb 1995, ''Warning Bells in 'glut' of Celebrants'', and ''Newsletter of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants'', No. 01 to No 14. 29 March 1994, to 1 January 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This provocative action galvanised all eleven celebrant organisations to challenge the government via the media.
With the assistance of leading constitutional lawyer, Professor Michael Pryles, and the abovementioned media publicity, the government responded.
The fixed fee was de-regulated on 1 July 1995. On 29 &amp; 30 August 1995 the federal government invited representatives of all eleven celebrant organisations to a meeting in Canberra — the National Council of Celebrants. More importantly, a search conference, initiated by public servant, Helen Eastburn,  was set up to establish Competency Standards under Jan Wallbridge and Jennifer Rivers of the Canberra Institute of Technology. This occurred on 29 and 30 August 1995 and was followed through and refined in intense correspondence and phone calls to everyone concerned in the weeks following.

A watershed of development and possibly symbolically expressing the most profound maturing within the celebrant movement were the series of conferences held at Pallotti College, Millgrove, northeast of Melbourne from 1994 to 1999. The committee of the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants decided that the Conferences should explore the nature of celebrancy itself and focus primarily on ceremony and ritual in society.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrations, Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, No. 15 to No.40, January 1996 to June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review of 2003: 2003–2013==
[[File:Four streams of weddings in Australia.png|600px|thumb|alt=text|left|Graph tracing the success of the civil marriage celebrant program in Australia from 1969 to 2004.Sometime in 1998 Civil weddings became more than 50% of all weddings performed in Australia.]]Thirty years later, following an extensive review and the introduction of reforms by the federal [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Daryl Williams, the marriage celebrant system changed. 
Williams promised a new structure and summarised his intentions as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* quality training for celebrants
* a careful selection process for the appointment of marriage celebrants
* a balancing of the number of celebrants appointed
* a Code of Practice which required careful attention to couples and their ceremonial needs
* precise attention to the requirements of laws and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}} p.272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since September 2003, prospective marriage celebrants have had to undergo Government-approved, accredited training in marriage celebrancy, and meet specific criteria set by the Attorney-General's Department to be declared a "fit and proper person" to hold the office of "marriage celebrant".

In this same month a series of legal and administrative changes to the civil celebrant program were put into effect by the Australian Government. Attorney-General Daryl Williams, who left the Australian Parliament in mid-term had, just before he resigned, approved a number of radical changes to the Marriage Act and the Regulations under the Act (Section 39 as it was, and after 2003). The most important of these was the legal transfer of powers over the program from the Attorney-General to an appointed public servant titled "The Registrar".&lt;ref&gt;from 1961 to 2003, Section 39 (2) of the Marriage Act read simply as follows : "''The Minister may, by instrument in writing, authorise … other fit and proper persons to solemnize marriages''." cf. Marriage Act 1961 as found in Handbook for Marriage Celebrants, Attorney General’s Department, Australian Government Publishing Services, Canberra, 1992. When the powers were transferred to the Registrar (public servant), several pages were added to the Act specifying those powers in detail; i.e., "Section 39 A to M" as found in ''The Marriage Act 1961'', Reprint 5, Attorney General’s Department, Canberra, 2003, {{ISBN|1-920838-16-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The program, from its beginnings in 1973 had always been referred to as the "Civil Celebrant Program". Under the 2003 changes, all civil celebrant appointments were cancelled, and all civil celebrants to this point were re-appointed by the Registrar, in the same category as clergy of small churches, as "Commonwealth Authorised Celebrants".&lt;ref&gt;Section 39 of ''The Marriage Act 1961'', Reprint 5, Attorney General’s Department, Canberra, 2003, {{ISBN|1-920838-16-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

New appointments were usually authorised by the Registrar after passing one Unit of Competency, of a since substantially discredited educational system of Nationally Authorised Training.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Sophie Cuttriss, ''The Age'', Melbourne, 12 August 2011; Australian Broadcasting Commission, 7:30 Report (TV), of 7 August 2012, 8 August 2012, 9 August 2012 and 5 September 2012; and Peter Crocker, Mary Colrain, Jeff Larson, and Sue McKerracher in ''The Age'' (Melbourne) Letters, 17 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a pass in this Unit&lt;ref&gt;Unit of Competency, CHCMCEL401A, ''Plan, Conduct, and Review a Marriage Ceremony''&lt;/ref&gt; certified by any Registered Training Organisation, on application to the Registrar, providing the applicant paid attention to the details of the written application, appointment as a Commonwealth Authorised Celebrant was more or less automatic, with the occasional exception.

This system led to a proliferation of celebrants and excessive competition.  It also led to a lowering of standards. In 2010, Melbourne journalist Mark Russell noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt; There are thousands of (rookie marriage celebrants) trying to undercut each other in the race down the aisle. Since federal laws were introduced seven years ago dispensing with the policy of appointing celebrants on a needs-only basis ... the number of Celebrants has tripled to more than 10,000 ...

many have inadequate training... The number of nuptial nightmares is soaring ... horror stories abound ... inexperienced celebrants have been accused of ruining wedding days because they don't know what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Russell |first=Mark |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/disaster-weddings-you-cant-blame-it-all-on-the-inlaws-20100619-yo2m.html |title=Disaster Weddings: You can't blame it all on the in-laws |newspaper=The Age |location= Melbourne |date=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article goes on to list the disastrous experience of many wedding days, the inadequacy of celebrant training, unpredictable cancellations by celebrants, the lowering of planning and rehearsing standards, the indignity of some celebrant advertising material and the "savage" over-competition.

On 15 January 2012, in an open letter to Attorney-General Nicola Roxon, nine senior celebrants protested their grievances at the deterioration of the program in which they had formerly felt pride and achievement. They listed:-
* The downgrading of status by the legal transfer of ministerial authority to a public servant.
* The setback to the high cultural standards they had worked for years to attain.
* The loss of identity in legally excluding the title "civil celebrant".
* The confusion of the general public as to who was a "religious" celebrant and who was not.
* The disrespect shown by the Registrar – especially to those who pioneered the program.
* The excessive number of celebrants and the consequent lowering of standards.

They recommended a policy based on the following principles.
*quality training for celebrants,
*a careful selection process for the appointment of marriage celebrants,
*a balancing of the number of celebrants appointed, and a
*Code of Practice which requires careful attention to couples (and other clients) and their ceremonial needs, and
*precise and correct attention to the requirements of laws and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collegeofcelebrancy.com.au/pages4/roxonopenltr4.html |title= General Template |publisher= Collegeofcelebrancy.com.au |accessdate= 13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
Until 2004 the Commonwealth Statistician (ABS-ref) customarily gave statistics for the
* Number of civil marriages by government registry offices
* Number of marriages performed by Independent civil marriage celebrants.
* Number of marriages by each of the major churches and religions.
* Number of marriages by smaller denominations (total).
After 2004 many of these statistics were discontinued. Statistics for the total number and proportion of religious and civil marriages are still published each year, but they do not distinguish between marriages conducted by registry office officials and those conducted by independent marriage celebrants. Similarly, statistics of religious marriages only give separate figures for the two largest denominations, Roman Catholics and Anglicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=3310.0 - Marriages and Divorces, Australia, 2014 |url= http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/3310.0Main+Features12014?OpenDocument |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= www.abs.gov.au |publisher= Australian Bureau of Statistics |access-date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrant training and education==
Until 1994, Celebrant Training was mainly achieved by informal but effective mentoring of new celebrants by the more experienced. This was augmented by seminars and conferences organised by the main celebrant organisations. Significant progress in understanding of the celebrant role was achieved at the annual "Pallotti" live-in conferences which took place at Warburton in Victoria from 1994 to 1999. International lecturers included Mary Hancock from New Zealand and David Oldfield from [[Washington DC]] in the US.
[[File:Mary Hancock.jpeg|thumb|Mary Hancock, Pioneer New Zealand Civil Celebrant (New Zealand adopted the Australian Model). Mary Hancock established the first training course for civil celebrants in the world in Auckland New Zealand (ca.1994).]] In 1994, the first formal training course for civil celebrants ever established, was created by pioneer civil celebrant Mary Hancock in Auckland, New Zealand. Shortly after, in Australia,  the International College of Celebrancy courses were established by Dally Messenger III.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally, Murphy's Law, ''op cit.'' pp. 231-259.&lt;/ref&gt;
After the changes of 2003, the Australian Government encouraged Registered Training Organisations to teach celebrancy, a system which was open to exploitation by unethical operators and which for civil celebrants, and for many other vocational training courses, proved disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;Tomazin, Farrah, "Skills Training Hits Bottom". ''The Age'' (front page story), Melbourne, 5 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Registration==
Registration provides the legal authority to practice as a marriage celebrant and a four-digit or five-digit alpha-numeric registration number. Once registered (or authorised as it is also known), the marriage celebrant can marry couples in virtually any location (e.g. reception centre "chapels", other de-consecrated chapels and churches, historic buildings, galleries, private homes, parks and gardens, beaches, headlands, boats etc.) and at any time of the day or night. The celebrant is responsible for processing and lodging all legal paperwork to register the marriage in accordance with defined procedures. This gives the Australian Civil Marriage Celebrant more status than they enjoy in other western countries, but also additional legal responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney),  {{ISBN|978-0-7336-2317-2}}. p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Messenger, Dally (2012). ''Murphy’s Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement''. Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), {{ISBN|978-0-86786-169-3}}. pp.199–205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral and general celebrants==
From 1975 a defined group of marriage and non-marriage celebrants declared themselves as [[Funeral Celebrants (Civil)|Funeral Celebrants]].  Many celebrants who are currently awaiting appointment as marriage celebrants and who cannot yet perform marriage ceremonies are practising as general celebrants in the community. Authorised marriage celebrants also frequently offer general celebrant services; but since these services are extra-legal, they may also be conducted on an ad hoc basis by untrained people.

General celebrants perform a range of different extra-legal ceremonies including naming (namegiving) ceremonies;&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Wendy, How to Create an Inspiring Naming Ceremony, Boolarong Press, Salisbury-Brisbane-Australia, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0975733-83-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; funerals; renewal of wedding vows; [[anniversaries]]; significant birthday celebrations; commitment ceremonies for [[homosexual|same-sex]] couples who are currently forbidden to marry under Australian law, or for heterosexual couples who cannot marry for personal, financial, religious or legal reasons; memorials and or scattering of ashes ceremonies; boat-naming ceremonies; dedication of new home or office ceremonies; graduation ceremonies; [[naturalisation]] (citizenship) ceremonies; becoming a teenager ([[coming of age]]) and other ceremonies.

The matter led to substantial [[news media]] attention during the presidential campaign, a new law being signed in [[Ohio]], and a federal [[civil rights]] [[lawsuit]] which was dismissed on August 4, 2010, on grounds that the privacy violation did not amount to a constitutional violation of the right to privacy.&lt;ref name="The Washington Times"&gt;{{cite web

==Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles searches==
Since ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'' reported on October 25, 2008, that "information on Wurzelbacher's driver's license or his sports utility vehicle was pulled [accessed] from the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles database three times," multiple state databases have been used to get information on Wurzelbacher.&lt;ref name ="The Columbus Dispatch"&gt;{{cite web

== ODJFS database searches ==
During the last few weeks of the 2008 US Presidential election campaign, ODJFS employees became embroiled in a controversy over searches of Joe Wurzelbacher's government records. State and local officials conducted an investigation into whether ODJFS Director [[Helen Jones-Kelley]]'s order to access Ohio government databases concerning Wurzelbacher was illegal; they concluded on November 20, 2008, that the searches breached protocol but found there was no evidence to prove they were part of a political agenda or linked with a political group or campaign.&lt;ref name="NBC 4"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given our understanding that Mr. Wurzelbacher had publicly indicated that he had the means to purchase a substantial business enterprise, ODJFS, consistent with past departmental practice, checked confidential databases to make sure that if Mr. Wurzelbacher did owe child support, or unemployment compensation taxes, or was receiving public assistance, appropriate action was being taken. The result of those checks have never been publicly shared.&lt;ref name ="The Plain Dealer 2"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'' reported on November 14, 2008, that "In response to a public-records request, the state agency said yesterday that it had no records involving previous checks of the type that Director Helen Jones-Kelley authorized on 'Joe the Plumber.'"&lt;ref name="C D 08"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8115">'''Copyright law of [[South Korea]]''' is regulated by the Copyright Act of 1957. It has been amended several times, with a recent 2009 revision introducing a [[three strikes (policy)|three strikes policy]] for online copyright infringement.

==History==
The concept of copyright first appeared in Korean writings in 1884.&lt;ref name=ykh/&gt; The history of the Korean copyright law dates to 1908, when during the [[occupation of Korea]], the [[Japanese copyright law]] was extended to cover the Korean territories in the form of the international treaty between the United States and Japan on the [[Protection of Industrial Property in Korea]].&lt;ref name="wash"/&gt; The Japanese law on copyright was used in Korea until 1957.&lt;ref name=ykh/&gt; The major Korean copyright legislation up to date, the Copyright Act of 1957, was enacted on January 28 of that year.&lt;ref name="wipo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; This act protected the works for 30 years after the death of the author, and included [[fair use]] provisions. Later revisions also addressed issues such as [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]].&lt;ref name=ykh/&gt;

The Act has had 14 amendments, including two consolidations (in 1986 and 2006).&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; The 1986 law extended the length of copyright to 50 years after the author's death, and introduced other modifications, bringing Korean copyright law in line with the [[Universal Copyright Convention]].&lt;ref name=wash/&gt; However, the transitional provisions laid out in the addendum of the 1986 law noted that the new law (and thus its longer term) did not apply to works whose copyright term under the earlier law had already expired.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt; As of 1999, acts of criminal copyright infringement were punishable with a prison term of up to three years and a fine of up to three million won.&lt;ref name=ykh/&gt; As of September 2012, the 2006 consolidated version was last amended by Law No. 9625 on April 22, 2009.&lt;ref name=wipo/&gt;

The 2009 revision gives the government (represented by the Korean [[Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism]] and the [[Korean Copyright Commission]]) the power to delete illegal reproductions, notify the copyright infringers, and suspend their online access, and is an implementation of the [[three strikes (policy)|three strikes policy]]. Article 133bis of the Korean Copyright Act allows the Korean Copyright Commission to request that the [[ISP]]s suspend the accounts of repeat file-sharing offenders, as determined by the Commission, for six months, and to upgrade this request to a demand if the Ministry becomes involved; the ISP has to follow the Ministry-backed demand or face a fine. However, user email accounts are not to be suspended.&lt;ref name=wash/&gt;

In general, copyright legislation in Korea has grown increasingly restrictive.&lt;ref name=wash/&gt; In the 1950s, the public opinion in Korea did not consider acts such as copying a book to be equivalent to stealing.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The 1957 act was very rarely implemented, and it was only after the revisions of 1986 that this changed.&lt;ref name="ykh"/&gt; Since then, the Korean law has been amended numerous times to protect the interests of various industries creating copyrighted works and bring Korean copyright law more in line with the international standards, such as those of the [[WIPO]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=wash/&gt; The number of copyright cases and rulings has grown significantly since 1986. Kyu Ho Youm noted that since the 1980s, copyright law has been transformed "from a largely ignored legal notion to a hotly debated concept in and out of court".&lt;ref name=ykh/&gt;

While the Korean copyright law has some unique characteristics, it has heavily drawn from foreign examples—particularly those of the United States.&lt;ref name=ykh/&gt;

[[Freedom of panorama]] in Korea is limited with regard to works of art in public places which cannot be distributed for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Česky |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Freedom_of_panorama#Korea_.28South.29 |title=Commons:Freedom of panorama - Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date=2003-03-25 |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The 2009 law has generated a number of criticisms, including from organizations such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="eff"/&gt; The critics argue that the current copyright law gives too much power to the copyright holders, which can hurt Korean competitiveness and culture, and ''de facto'' limits the [[freedom of expression]] and thus boosts [[Internet censorship in South Korea]].&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff/&gt; Hundreds of Korean Internet users have been disconnected from the Internet after not three, but one strike; "half of those suspended were involved in infringement of material that would cost less than 90 U.S. cents".&lt;ref name="techdirt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gcp"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bb2013&gt;{{cite web|author=Cory Doctorow at 9:13 am Sat, Mar 30 |url=http://boingboing.net/2013/03/30/south-korea-lives-in-the-futur.html |title=South Korea lives in the future (of brutal copyright enforcement) |publisher=Boing Boing |date= |accessdate=2013-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013 [[National Human Rights Commission of Korea|Korea's National Human Rights Commission]] recommended a reexamination of the 2009 law, noting that its benefits are poorly documented, while it poses serious concerns to the issues related to cultural expression and human rights.&lt;ref name=bb2013/&gt;

In 2015, Doctorow decided to leave London and move to Los Angeles, feeling disappointed by London's "death" from Britain's choice of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government. He claims on his blog, "But London is a city whose two priorities are being a playground for corrupt global elites who turn neighbourhoods into soulless collections of empty safe-deposit boxes in the sky, and encouraging the feckless criminality of the finance industry. These two facts are not unrelated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/06/29/why-im-leaving-london.html|title=Why I'm leaving London|first=Cory|last=Doctorow|date=29 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejoined the EFF in January 2015 to campaign for the eradication of [[Digital rights management|digital rights management (DRM)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cory Doctorow Rejoins EFF to Eradicate DRM everywhere|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/cory-doctorow-rejoins-eff-eradicate-drm-everywhere|website=EFF.org|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work, activism, and fellowships===
He served as Canadian Regional Director of the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]] in 1999.

Together with Austrian art group [[monochrom]], he initiated the ''Instant Blitz Copy Fight'' project, which asks people from all over the world to take flash pictures of copyright warnings in movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monochrom.at/piracy/ |title=Instant Blitz Copy Fight web site |accessdate=2008-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netzpolitik.org/2007/instant-blitz-copy-fight-project/ |title=Instant Blitz Copy Fight on netzpolitik.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a user of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]] for more than a decade during his global travels, Doctorow publicly supports the network; furthermore, Boing Boing operates a "high speed, high-quality exit node."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-tor-supporter-looks-cory-doctorow|title=This is What a Tor Supporter Looks Like: Cory Doctorow|publisher=The Tor Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]],'' Doctorow's first novel, was published in January 2003, and was the first novel released under one of the [[Creative Commons licences]], allowing readers to circulate the electronic edition as long as they neither made money from it nor used it to create [[derived work]]s. The electronic edition was released simultaneously with the print edition. In March 2003, it was re-released with a different Creative Commons licence that allowed derivative works such as [[fan fiction]], but still prohibited commercial usage.

His novel ''[[Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town]],'' published in June 2005, was chosen to launch the Sci-Fi Channel's book club, Sci-Fi Essentials (now defunct).

Doctorow's other novels have been released with Creative Commons licences that allow derived works and prohibit commercial usage, and he has used the model of making digital versions available, without charge, at the same time that print versions are published.

Doctorow believes that copyright laws should be liberalized to allow for free sharing of all digital media. He has also advocated [[filesharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doctorow |first=Cory |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/12/steal-this-file-shar.html |title=Steal This File Sharing Book – A–Z HOWTO for file-sharing |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2004-12-12 |accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that copyright holders should have a monopoly on ''selling'' their own digital media and that copyright laws should not be operative unless someone attempts to sell a product that is under someone else's copyright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doctorow|first=Cory|title=The Internet is Not a Waffle Iron Connected to a Fax Machine|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-internet-is-not-a-waffle-iron-connected-to-a-fax-machine|publisher=IAI|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctorow is an opponent of [[digital rights management]] and claims that it limits the free sharing of digital media and frequently causes problems for legitimate users (including registration problems that lock users out of their own purchases and prevent them from being able to move their media to other devices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4454381456832593071 |title=Cory Doctorow at Cambridge Business Lectures |publisher=Video.google.com |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[webcomic]] '[[xkcd]]' occasionally features a partially fictional version of Doctorow who lives in a [[hot air balloon]] up in the "[[blogosphere]]" ("above the tag clouds") and wears a red cape and goggles, such as in the comic "Blagofaire".&lt;ref&gt;[http://xkcd.com/239/ xkcd.com/239] (see also [e.g.], [http://xkcd.com/345/ xkcd.com/345], [http://xkcd.com/482/ xkcd.com/482], [http://xkcd.com/497/ xkcd.com/497], [http://xkcd.com/498/ xkcd.com/498], and [http://xkcd.com/527/ xkcd.com/527])&lt;/ref&gt; When Doctorow won the 2007 [[EFF Pioneer Award]], the presenters gave him a red cape, goggles and a balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blag.xkcd.com/2007/03/28/cory-doctorow-part-ii/ | title=Cory Doctorow, Part II | work=xkcd | date=2007-03-28 | accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel ''[[Ready Player One]]'' features a mention of Doctorow as being the newly re-elected President of the OASIS User Council (with [[Wil Wheaton]] as his Vice-President) in the year 2044, saying that, "...those two geezers had been doing a kick-ass job of protecting user rights for over a decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cline|first=Ernest|title=Ready Player One|year=2011|publisher=Broadway|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-88744-3|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comedic [[role-playing game]] [[Kingdom of Loathing]] features a boss-fight against a [[monster]] named Doctor Oh who is described as wearing a red cape and goggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Doctor_Oh,_the_Junksprite_Boss | title=Doctor Oh | work=Kingdom of Loathing | date=2013-10-08 | accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commentary before the fight and assorted hit, miss and fumble messages during the battle make reference to Doctorow's advocacy for Open-Source sharing and freedom of media.

[[File:Urbeach-high-park-splashpad.jpg|thumb|Crumb rubber coating on the concrete of the urban beach splash pad within the municipal swimming baths at [[High Park]] in [[Toronto]].]]

'''Crumb rubber''' is recycled [[rubber]] produced from [[automotive]] and [[truck]] [[scrap tires]]. During the recycling process, [[steel]] and tire cord (fluff) are removed, leaving tire rubber with a granular consistency. Continued processing with a granulator or cracker mill, possibly with the aid of [[cryogenics]] or by mechanical means, reduces the size of the [[Micronized rubber powder|particles]] further.  The particles are sized and classified based on various criteria including color (black only or black and white). The granulate is sized by passing through a [[Mechanical screening|screen]], the size based on a dimension (1/4 inch) or ''mesh'' (holes per inch : 10, 20, etc.). Crumb rubber is often used in [[artificial turf]] as cushioning.

==Background==
The first [[synthetic grass]] was placed over concrete in 1964 and became known as “Chem Grass”. It was later named “Astro Turf” when it was installed in the [[Houston Astrodome]] in 1966. Athletes did not like playing on these fields because it was dangerous and not comfortable for their landings. Compared to only a thin layer of Astro Turf on top of concrete, a new [[artificial turf]] was developed in the early 2000s and was called [[styrene]] [[butadiene]] rubber, most commonly known as “crumb rubber.” This rubber was made of small black crumb pieces that came from old tires. The tire crumbs were poured in between the fake grass blades, giving the artificial fields more cushion and support. This was a better solution and satisfied athletes and aided in the prevention of major injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rappleye|first1=Hannah|title=How Safe is the Artificial Turf?|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/how-safe-artificial-turf-your-child-plays-n220166|website=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycled pavement material==
[[Rubberized asphalt]] is the largest market for crumb rubber in the United States, consuming an estimated {{convert|220|e6lb}}, or approximately 12 million tires annually.&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/garbage/tires/ground.htm |title=Management of Scrap Tires |accessdate=2007-06-12 |author=EPA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumb rubber is also used as ground cover under playground equipment, and as a surface material for running tracks and athletic fields.&lt;ref name=epa/&gt;

==Composition==
*71% recoverable rubber
*14% steel
*3% fiber
*12% extraneous material

==Grading==
The following are common classifications of crumb rubber:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.recycle.net/Rubber/granule/xv132000.html | title=Granulated Rubber (Tire Crumb) | accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''No.5''' - Tire Granule shall consist of unclassified granulated tire crumb, Sized, Unseparated, not magnetically separated, fluff from tire cord not removed.

==Purposes==
* Athletic surfaces and fields ([[rubber mulch]])
* Agrimats and [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] footing
* Automotive parts and tires
* Construction/indoor
* Landscape, trails and walkways
* Molded and extruded products
* Playground and other safety surfaces
* Rubber modified asphalt and sealants
* Rubber and plastic blends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artificial Turf: Exposures to Ground Up Rubber Tires - Athletic Fields, Playgrounds, Garden Mulch|url=http://www.ehhi.org/reports/turf/health_effects.shtml#b|website=Environment and Human Health Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
When dealing with asphalt overlays, reflection cracks can arise and cause an unwanted crack pattern beneath the pavement. Rubber-modified asphalt uses stress absorbing membranes that reduce the reflective cracking because of its elastic properties. With fewer cracks, there are fewer repairs, so crumb rubber assists in reducing maintenance costs. The pavement has an increased lifespan because after multiple uses and exposure to different elements, regular asphalt loses elasticity over time. The use of the artificial rubber resists the formation of cracks and has an [[anti-aging]] effect that keeps the asphalt in a better condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefits of Rubberized Asphalt|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/arts/benefitsofRA.html|website=Clemson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns==
=== Scientific Research ===
Crumb rubber infill has been a widely studied topic. To date, there are nearly 100 studies and reports, from government bodies and independent researchers, that have assessed the potential for health risks based on various pathways of exposure. Connecticut’s Department of Public Health conducted an extensive study and published three peer-reviewed studies on the safety of crumb rubber&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/dph/cwp/view.asp?a=3140&amp;q=464068&amp;dphNav_GID=1828|title=DPH: Artificial Turf Fields|last=Health|first=Department of Public|website=ct.gov|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and determined that there is “no scientific support for a finding of elevated cancer risk from inhalation or ingestion of chemicals derived from recycled tires used on artificial turf fields.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.southhadley.org/DocumentCenter/View/1559&lt;/ref&gt; The Massachusetts’s Department of Health also studied crumb rubber and came to a similar conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexingtonma.gov/sites/lexingtonma/files/uploads/madeptofpublichealthletter-march_2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Three federal agencies are currently conducting a study as well.
However and more up-to-date: The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are about to conclude a peer led study of all US studies in mid to late 2018, using peer and public evidence to fill in the information gaps between the avenues of study and real life anecdotal concerns, experiences with medical scientific perspectives included.
In the EU, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) had also produced a report titled ANNEX XV which specifically looked at rubber crumb chemical make up and at concerns. It too overall concluded that the risks were extremely low compared to the benefits of health and exercise presumably. However, as recently as 2017 and again now in 2018, further chemicals have begun to be scrutinized further which were previously unregistered in that incarnation of the ANNEX report on rubber crumb. Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC's) are carcinogenic chemicals, endocrine disruptive chemicals and chemicals dangerous to aquatic life and are more and more being identified as in need of restriction in the ECHA REACH2018 program. Chemicals such as chrysene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(e)pyrene, benzene and others are now on the restricted chemicals Candidate List, ready to be included in the next incarnation of the ANNEX XIV report, presumably also in 2018. To see the ECHA restricted chemicals Candidate List, click here &lt;ref&gt;https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table&lt;/ref&gt;. With PAHs, phthalates, lead and all of the other substances already mentioned thus far in this overall topic, it is worth mentioning that none of the studies have looked at the cocktail effects of these various chemicals or substances of concerns and in 2018, the US professional female football goalie who in recent years coaches younger goalies, noticed an increase in the number of adolescent goalies with cancers. Ami Griffin's discoveries have been logged by her over a number of years. Her findings are perhaps anecdotal but nevertheless, do point at a link between younger players who have played on surfaces that have rubber crumb as the infill and with them developing cancers. To see that study, click here &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ehhi.org/turf-cancer-stats.php&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Athletics===
{{Original research|section|date=January 2016}}
[[Artificial turf]] fields are found all over the United States and are most commonly found at major high schools and athletic facilities. Crumb rubber is used in the “infill” in artificial turf systems to make the surface safe. Volumes of research and testing from academics, federal and state governments including New York, California, Massachusetts and Connecticut, and school systems have examined everything called into question about synthetic turf. Many of these studies concluded that no health risks exist. Contradicting studies have found that the raw source material (automotive tires) contains high levels of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] and metals such as zinc which have proven dermal, acute, and long-term health affects. The EPA is (as of fall 2015) investigating the health affects of exposure to crumb rubber and the initial results of this study are expected at the beginning of 2016.

State of Connecticut - Department of Public Health: "Based upon these findings, the use of outdoor and indoor artificial turf fields is not associated with elevated health risks. However, it would be prudent for building operators to provide adequate ventilation to prevent a buildup of rubber-related [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) at indoor fields. The current study did not evaluate new fields under hot weather conditions and so the potential for acute risks under this circumstance is another uncertainty. The current results are generally consistent with the findings from studies conducted by New York City, New York State, the [[USEPA]] and Norway which tested different kinds of fields and under a variety of weather conditions. Thus, it appears that the current results are reasonably representative of conditions that can be encountered at indoor and outdoor crumb rubber fields, although this tentative conclusion could benefit from the testing of additional fields.."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ct.gov/deep/lib/deep/artificialturf/dph_artificial_turf_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lioy: “The study demonstrated that for the products and fields we tested, exposure to infill and artificial turf was generally considered {{sic|de minimus}}, with the possible exception of [[lead]] for some fields and materials.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Pavilonis|first=Brian T.|last2=Weisel|first2=Clifford|last3=Buckley|first3=Brian| last4=Lioy|first4=Paul J.|year=2014|title=Bioaccessibility and Risk of Exposure to Metals and SVOCs in Artificial Turf Field Fill Materials and Fibers |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1111/risa.12081/abstract|journal=Risk Analysis|volume=34|issue=1|pages=44-55|doi=10.1111/risa.12081|pmc=4038666}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FIFA]]’s Chief Medical Officer Prof. Jiří Dvořák says that “The majority of the studies have been on higher surface area particles and have concluded they are currently acceptable. Therefore the larger granules used in artificial turf will have even less potential for emissions. For example a study undertaken by the Danish Ministry of the Environment concluded that the health risk on children’s playgrounds that contained both worn tires and granulate rubber was insignificant. The available body of research does not substantiate the assumption that [[cancer]] resulting from exposure to [[styrene-butadiene]] (SBR) granulate infills in artificial turf could potentially occur.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fieldturf.com/sites/fieldturf/assets/3%20-%20FIFA-letter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific Instrument Services, [[Volatile organic compound|Volatile Organic Emissions]] from Automobile Tires, 1999, Santford V. Overton &amp; John J. Manura : Tire "Brand A were found to contain numerous straight and branched chain hydrocarbons, aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, furans and benzene derivatives." Tire brand B was..."found to contain high concentrations of the compounds [[sulfur dioxide]] (DOT), 2-methyl-1-propene, 2-propanone, 2-methyl-2-pentene, 2,4-[[pentanedione]], [[acetic acid]] and 2,4-(1H, 3H) [[pyrimidinedione]]." Chemicals extracted from raw tires in this study would be found in crumb rubber, which is made by grinding feedstock tires. The chemicals listed above include carcinogens, and other chemicals with dermal and [[endocrine disrupting]] impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sisweb.com/referenc/applnote/app-37.htm|title=Note 37: Volatile Organic Emissions from Automobile Tires|publisher=sisweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impacts===
Crumb rubber is used as a filling in [[artificial turf]] fields. In 2007, use in this capacity prevented about 300 million pounds of rubber from polluting [[landfills]]. Generally, it takes 20,000–40,000 scrap tires to produce enough filling to cover an average [[American football#Field and equipment|football field]] (City of Portland, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of the Impacts of  Crumb Rubber in Artificial  Turf Applications|url=http://www.libertytire.com/Libraries/Documents/UC-Berkeley-Manex-Review-of-Impacts-of-Crumb-Rubber-in-Turf.sflb.ashx|website=Liberty Tire|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108165850/http://www.libertytire.com/Libraries/Documents/UC-Berkeley-Manex-Review-of-Impacts-of-Crumb-Rubber-in-Turf.sflb.ashx|archivedate=2015-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection found in a 2010 study that [[stormwater]] passing through crumb rubber regularly exceeded [[aquatic toxicity|aquatic acute toxicity]] for [[zinc]]. Additionally, [[copper]], [[barium]], [[manganese]] and [[aluminum]] were found at elevated levels after stormwater contacted the materials. [[Semi-volatile organic compounds]] and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s were found to be elevated as well. The levels of most of these compounds were higher than background but were below levels regulated in waterways for [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ct.gov/deep/lib/deep/artificialturf/dep_artificial_turf_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9730">The '''Employment Act 1982''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (1982 c. 46), mainly relating to [[trade union]]s. It increased [[Damages|compensation]] for those dismissed because of the [[closed shop]] and restricted the [[Immunity from prosecution|immunities]] enjoyed by trade unions.

==Background==

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government had already passed the [[Employment Act 1980]] which restricted the definition of lawful [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]] and introduced ballots on the existence of the closed shop where it operated, needing 80% support of the workers to be maintained. The 1982 Act was a direct response to the consultations held on the basis of the [[Green paper|Green Paper]], ''Trade Union Immunities'' (Cmnd. 8128), published in January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Campaign Guide 1983'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Secretary of State for Employment]], [[Norman Tebbit]], introduced the Bill in the House of Commons, saying: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have not sought to transform the whole framework of industrial relations law...we have tried to provide specific remedies for real abuses, to promote effective protection where it has been shown to be necessary, and to redress the imbalance of bargaining power to which the legislation of the last Government had contributed so significantly.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1982/feb/08/employment-bill 'Hansard'', 8 February 1982, Col. 738]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Contents==

The Act's main provisions came into force on 1 December, 1982. The statute:&lt;ref&gt;''Campaign Guide 1983'', pp. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Gave the government the power to issue compensation to some of those who were fired from their jobs due to the [[closed shop]] under the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government's legislation between 1974 and 1980. The people entitled to compensation are those whose sackings would have been unlawful if the clauses of the Employment Act 1980 had been law at the time.
# Extensively enlarged the amount of money that can be awarded in compensation to those who are unlawfully fired for not belonging to a trade union in a [[closed shop]]. The compensation in these cases, under the Act, are between £12,000 and £30,000 and can be lessened if a tribunal discovers that the employee contributed to his own dismissal.
# Deemed it unlawful to sack a worker for not being a trade union member in a closed shop where the closed shop arrangements have not been approved in the previous five years by the necessary 80% of workers or 85% of workers voting in secret ballots. This clause came into force on 1 November 1984 to enable trade unions and employers enough time to organise ballots.
# Outlawed "trade union labour only contracts". This makes it unlawful to deny to put companies in tendering lists or to award or offer contracts to them for reasons that they hire either trade union members or non-trade union members. Also, it removes the immunity from those who pressurise employers to act in this way or who organise industrial action to inhibit non-trade union companies from honouring their contracts.
# Immunity from civil action for trade unions was brought into line with individual trade union officials, therefore making trade unions open to damages, depending on the size of the trade union, between £10,000 and £250,000 where they are responsible for unlawful industrial action.
# Lawful trade disputes were restricted to those disputes between employers and their workers concerning working conditions, wages, etc. This new definition, therefore, excludes disputes between an employer and a trade union where (i) none of the workers are in a dispute, (ii) disputes between trade unions and workers, (iii) and disputes connected only to working conditions, wages, etc. and not about them either mainly or wholly. This definition also does not include disputes on foreign matters unless the jobs of the workers striking in [[Great Britain]] are likely to be affected by the outcome of the dispute. Immunity is removed from [[solidarity action|secondary action]] when taken by workers of one company to pressurise another company where there is no dispute between their workers and employers.
# Empowered employers to fire striking workers and not face unfair dismissal claims if all workers involved in the strike at a particular workplace on a particular day are sacked. This allows employers to selectively fire striking workers, like those who continue to strike whilst other workers have returned to work.
# Firms with more than 250 workers were required to include a statement in their annual report documenting the action they have pursued to develop arrangements for involving and consulting their workers. This clause came into effect on 1 January 1983.
# Sections of the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974]] which the courts had interpreted as giving immunity to those who "[[sit-in]]" or "occupy" their workplaces were repealed.

==Response==
A [[Trades Union Congress]] Special Conference was held on 5 April 1982, where trade union leaders voted to support an eight-point plan to oppose the Act. A campaign pack entitled ''Fight Tebbit's Law'' was issued, and a travelling exhibition toured trade union conferences. The TUC encouraged trade unions to refuse to vote in closed shop ballots; to refuse public money for ballots under the Employment Act 1980; to gain the support of other trade unions in disputes; to forbid their members to sit on industrial tribunals concerning cases on the closed shop; and to help the TUC co-ordinate industrial action in support of any trade union facing legal action by an employer. A levy of ten pence per trade union member was raised to finance this campaign,&lt;ref&gt;''Campaign Guide 1983'', p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; which raised over one million pounds to 'Kill the Bill'.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Tebbit, ''Upwardly Mobile'' (Futura, 1991), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Trade union leaders voted overwhelmingly at the TUC Conference on 7 September 1982 for militant resistance&amp;mdash;including industrial action&amp;mdash;to the Act.

The [[General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress|General Secretary of the TUC]], [[Len Murray, Baron Murray of Epping Forest|Len Murray]], said of the TUC campaign:

:''We cannot be sure that we can deliver...[Government propaganda] has even found credence among many of our members who value what their own unions do for them but are, paradoxically and illogically, at best apathetic and at worst sympathetic to the Government's purpose. We have a major job alerting trade unionists themselves to the real nature of the proposals''.&lt;ref&gt;Speech at the Wembley Special Conference, 5 April 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], [[Arthur Scargill]], said of the Act: ''There is only one response that this movement can give, faced with this legislation. We should say "We will defy the law".''&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'', 8 September 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairman of the TUC Employment Committee, [[Bill Keys (trade unionist)|Bill Keys]], said:
:''I will say publicly anywhere, if it is a bad law that doesn't nurture good, that doesn't look after the interests of ordinary people in this nation I will oppose the law and I will influence other people to oppose the law...if that means breaking the law I will do it.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 21 January 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The TUC President for 1982, [[Frank Chapple]], disagreed:
:''Those who advocate that bad laws should not be obeyed&amp;mdash;in circumstances where such "bad" laws are enacted by a democratically elected government&amp;mdash;are putting at risk the entire conception of civilised society. That directly challenges democracy...the way to change bad laws is to change the government that has made them.''&lt;ref&gt;IRIS News, October 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging by [[opinion poll]]s, the Act had the support of the general public and trade unionists. A [[MORI]] poll in November 1981 revealed that 79% of the public and 77% of trade unionists agreed that regular ballots should be held in existing closed shops; 70% of the public and 61% of trade unionists agreed that a company should be allowed to [[lawsuit|sue]] a trade union if it lost money in dispute which was unconnected to the company; and 76% of the public and 70% of trade unionists agreed that companies should be able to sue trade unions which broke agreements.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 30 November 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Marplan]] poll showed that half of the trade unionists questioned opposed unlawful action in defiance of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 7 September 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 50% of trade unionists in a MORI poll supported the TUC campaign, and a [[Gallup poll]] found that over 50% of the public and trade unionists believed that leaders of trade union who broke the law should be sent to prison.&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'', 6 September 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tebbit in his memoirs says of the Act: "I have no doubt that Act was my greatest achievement in Government and I believe it has been one of the principal pillars on which the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] economic reforms have been built."&lt;ref&gt;Tebbit, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foreign worker visa''' is an immigration document that allows a [[Foreign worker|foreign national]] to temporarily live and work in a country. Ideally, such foreign nationals remedy a skill shortage in the host country, which gains support of business groups.

{{Ancien Régime}}
The '''gabelle''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡabɛl}}) was a very unpopular tax on salt in France that was established during the mid-14th century and lasted, with brief lapses and revisions, until 1946. The term gabelle is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gabella'' (a duty), itself originating from the [[Arabic]] word ''qabala''&lt;big&gt; قَبَلَ &lt;/big&gt;("he received").

In France, the gabelle was originally an indirect tax that was applied to agricultural and industrial commodities, such as bed sheets, wheat, spices, and wine. However, from the 14th century onward, the gabelle was limited and solely referred to the French crown’s taxation of salt.

Because the gabelle affected all French citizens (for use in cooking, for preserving food, for making cheese and for raising livestock) and propagated extreme regional disparities in salt prices, the salt tax stood as one of the most hated and grossly unequal forms of revenue generation in the country’s history. Repealed in 1790 by the National Assembly in the midst of the [[French Revolution]], the gabelle was later reinstated by [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1806. It was briefly terminated and reinstated again during the French Second Republic and ultimately abolished in 1945 following France’s liberation from Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first= Jean | last = Chazelas | title = La suppression de la gabelle du sel en 1945 | journal = Le rôle du sel dans l'histoire: travaux préparés sous la direction de Michel Mollat | publisher = Presses universitaires de France | year = 1968 | pages = 263–65 | url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/role-du-sel-dans-lhistoire-travaux-prepares-sous-la-direction-de-michel-mollat/oclc/14501767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
In 1229, when the [[Albigensian Crusades]] were brought to a close by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] and his mother ([[Blanche of Castile]]), France gained control of the [[Rhône]] Estuary and nearby Mediterranean coast. This led to the establishment of the first French Mediterranean port city of [[Aigues-Mortes]] in 1246, literally translated to Dead Waters, and the creation of a vast network of salt-evaporation ponds. These saltworks would fund St. Louis’ (as he was later called) ambitions of crusading in the Middle East.  A profitable means of generating revenue for France’s wars, this royal control over salt and its production stands as the origin of the infamous French salt gabelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kurlansky |first= Mark |date= 2002 |title= Salt |url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Group |page= 154 |isbn=0-8027-1373-4 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A temporary tax under St. Louis, in 1259, his brother [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]] further established royal control over salt, in this case over the Berre saltworks near Marseilles. This salt administration would eventually encompass Peccais, Aigues-Mortes, and the region of Camargue and come to be known as the Pays de petites gabelles. On March 16, 1341, [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI of Valois]] established the first permanent royal tax on salt in France, known as the Pays de grandes gabelles.

Repressive as a state monopoly, it was made doubly so by the government obliging every individual above the age of eight years to buy weekly a minimum amount of salt at a fixed price. Known as the ''Sel de devoir'', translated to "salt duty", citizens in the ''Pays de grandes gabelles'' region were forced to buy up to 7 kilograms of salt per year. Furthermore, they were unable to use this salt for making salted products, which was considered illegal and could lead to charges of ''faux saunage'', or salt fraud. Failing to adhere to this could lead to imprisonment and, if repeated, death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kurlansky |first= Mark |date= 2002 |title= Salt |url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Group |page= 226 |isbn=0-8027-1373-4 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each province had a ''Greniers à sel''—a salt granary—where all salt produced from that region needed to be taken in order to be bought (at a fixed price) and sold (at an inflated price).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beyondtheshaker.com/pages/Salt-Guide-History.html |title=A Brief and Fascinating History of Salt |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=beyondtheshaker.com/ |publisher= |access-date=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
When first instituted, the ''gabelle'' was levied uniformly on all the provinces in France at a rate of 1.66% on the sale price. However, for the greater part of its history, the prices varied and resulted in large disparities between the different provinces. There were six distinct groups of provinces, which were called ''pays'' (lit. "countries"; to be understood as an obsolete word for "region"), and classified as follows:
*the ''Pays de grandes gabelles''; this region included the Parisian Basin and the oldest provinces of the kingdom: [[Île-de-France]], [[Berry (province)|Berry]], [[Orléanais]], [[Touraine]], [[Anjou]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]], [[Bourbonnais]], [[Normandy]], [[Burgundy|Bourgogne]] (except the southeastern third), [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] (except the county of [[Rethel]], which retained the lower tax granted earlier), [[Picardy]] (except the area of [[Boulonnais (land area)|Boulonnais]] and the bishopric of [[Cambrai]]). The largest of the six regions, it had not only the highest salt prices but also a mandatory salt duty for all people over eight years of age. One-third of France’s population resided within this region, and paid two-thirds of all salt revenue, but only consumed one-fourth of all salt.
*the ''Pays de petites gabelles''; this region included the provinces of [[Lyonnais]], [[Provence]], [[Roussillon]], [[Languedoc]], and [[Dauphiné]], southeast Burgundy (the districts of [[Mâconnais]], [[Bresse]], [[Bugey]], and [[Beaujolais (province)|Beaujolais]]), and southern [[History of Auvergne|Auvergne]] (the districts of [[Forez]] and [[Rouergue]]). This region covered southeastern France, including the Mediterranean coastline and the lower [[Rhône]] valley. The ''gabelle'' there was about half of the rate as in the ''pays de grandes gabelles''. One-fifth of all France’s population resided within this region and paid one-fourth of royal salt revenue.
*the ''Pays de quart-bouillon''; these provinces included Avranches, Coutances, Bayeux, and Pont l’Evêque. One-fourth of all salt produced in this region went to the royal granaries.
*the ''Pays de salines''; these provinces included Franche-Comté, Lorraine, the Trois Evêches (Metz, Toul, and Verdun) and Alsace. Unlike in the petites and grandes regions, the laws enforced here allowed private merchants to engage in retail and wholesale salt distribution rather than complete oversight by state officials. As a result, this region’s salt prices were less affected by the gabelle and its people more content with its effects. People here consumed twice as much salt as the citizens of the Pays de grandes gabelles.
*the ''Pays redimés''; these provinces included Poitou, Limousin, Auvergne, Marche, Guyenne, Périgord, Bigorre, Pays de Foix, and Comminges. Following insurrections caused by tax measures in the early to middle 1500s, in this region, in 1549, an agreement was made that  citizens there would pay a large lump sum to the king and be forever excused from salt taxes. Instead, they were only taxed at tolls when transporting salt.
*the ''Pays exempts'';  these free provinces included Brittany, Boulonnais, Calaisis, Hainault, Artois, Flanders, Cambrésis, the principalities of Sedan and Raucour, Nebouzan, Béarn, Soule, Lower Navarre, Labours, the region of Gex, Arles, the islands of Ré and Oleron and the parts of the Aunis and Poitou that were near the salines of the Atlantic. Before coming into the kingdom of France, all of the aforementioned regions made agreements with the crown that they would only do so if they were not under the jurisdiction of the gabelle.

==Smuggling==
Because all of the ''Pays'' had extreme disparities in tax rates and salt consumption, opportunities for [[smuggling]] were ripe within France. In 1784, [[Jacques Necker]], a French statesman of Swiss birth and finance minister of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] until the French Revolution, reported that a minot of salt, which was 49 kilograms (107.8 pounds) cost only 31 sous in Brittany, but 81 in Poitou, 591 in Anjou, and 611 in Berry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kurlansky |first= Mark |date= 2002 |title= Salt |url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Group |page= 231 |isbn=0-8027-1373-4 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large differences in cost between various ''pays'' clearly show the reason behind the active smuggling of salt that took place in France until the gabelle was abolished. The obvious means of smuggling salt was to buy it in a region where it was cheap and to sell it illegally in regions where it was expensive, at a higher price, but still less than the legal price. Such smugglers were called ''faux-sauniers'', from ''faux'' ("false") and the root ''sau''-, referring to salt. They were able to amass large fortunes and seen by French citizens as heroes against an arbitrary and oppressive tax of a common good necessary to life. In turn, the customs guards tasked with arresting the ''faux-sauniers'' were called ''gabelous'', a term obviously derived from the gabelle they sought to uphold. They were despised by common folk as they were, without cause, able to search people and their homes to find illegal salt. The ''gabelous'' carried weapons and were known to grope women for pleasure under the guise of looking for salt. However, women were often used to smuggle salt under their dresses and sometimes used false derrières known as ''faux culls''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kurlansky |first= Mark |date= 2002 |title= Salt |url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Group |page= 232 |isbn=0-8027-1373-4 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the eighteenth century, female smuggling was so common in some areas, especially in the west, that more women were arrested than men. It has been estimated that between 1759 and 1788, out of the 4788 arrests in Laval, 2845 women and children were arrested, amounting to more than half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brias |first=Bernard |date=1984 |title= Contrebandiers du sel: La vie des faux sauniers au temps de la gabelle |url= |location=Paris |publisher= |pages=84–90 |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the 1640 codification of gabelle law by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], participating in ''faux saunage'', warranted a range of harsh punishments. Merely housing a ''faux-saunier'' could lead to imprisonment, fines, and, if repeated, death. ''Faux-sauniers'' could be sentenced to up to ten years on a galley if they were caught without weapons, and to death if caught while armed. Other forms of ''faux-saunage'' included sheepherders letting their flock drink from salty ponds, traders overly salting cod during transportation, and fishing at night (so that fisherman with great knowledge of waterways could not smuggle salt). French nobles, if caught buying contraband salt, would immediately lose their status of nobility following their first offense. In 1773, along the [[Loire|Loire River]], which separated the regions of Brittany and Anjou, with respective salt prices of 31 sous and 591 sous, over 3000 soldiers were stationed in response to the massive amounts of smuggling that took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kurlansky |first= Mark |date= 2002 |title= Salt |url= |location= |publisher= Penguin Group |page= 233 |isbn=0-8027-1373-4 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolution==
There are many reasons for the [[French Revolution]], but the unfair taxes and financial burden imposed upon the lower-classes and peasants was a main facet of the general population’s discontent. Each year, by the end of the 18th century, about 3000 citizens (men, women, and children) were being imprisoned, sent to the galleys, or put to death for crimes against the gabelle. All the while, religious persons, nobility, and high-ranking officials were often exempt from the gabelle or paid much lower taxes. In 1789, following the ascension of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the gabelle was voted down and abolished throughout France. Later, in 1790, the National Assembly decided that all persons imprisoned for breaking laws pertaining to the gabelle were to be freed from prison and that all charges and convictions were to be permanently dropped.

This freedom would be short lived, however, as [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] reinstated the gabelle in 1804, this time without major exemptions for regions such as Brittany. The gabelle stayed part of France’s legislation until abolished in 1946.

==Salt taxes outside France==
{{Merge to|Salt tax|section=y|date=December 2017}}
The gabelle, and other salt taxes, have existed outside France before and after the French Revolution in 1790. The most notable instances are the [[Salt in Chinese history|salt tax in China]] and the salt tax in India including that under the British.

In China, a state monopoly on salt, also known as the salt gabelle, has existed since 119 B.C and lasted until 2014, making it the world’s oldest (and possibly first) state monopoly in the world. By the [[Tang dynasty#Rebuilding and recovery|mid-Tang dynasty]], taxes on salt brought in more than half of the government's tax revenue, and continued to be a major factor even in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Adshead 2004"&gt;Samuel Adrian M. Adshead. ''T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History.'' (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004; {{ISBN|1403934568}}), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, there had been a tax on salt for hundreds of years but it was greatly increased following the rule of India’s provinces by the [[British East India Company]]. In salt producing regions such as [[Odisha|Orissa]], private sale of salt was prohibited, and salt found being transported had to be sold to the British authorities at a fixed price, and, in later years, the production of salt was banned completely. This was done to maintain the high price of British salt by destroying India’s long established tradition of salt-making. In 1858, when Britain took control of the Indian provinces, these taxes remained.

Salt played a large role in India’s quest for independence. In 1930, [[Mahatma Gandhi]]’s famous [[Salt March|Salt Satyagraha]] took place and led to nonviolent protests throughout the provinces of British India. A 24-day, 240-mile march from [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to the coastal village of Dandi, Gandhi was going to, at the journey’s end, illegally harvest salt without paying tax to the British Crown. Salt was chosen by Gandhi because its taxation was extremely detrimental to the poorest of Indians and, "Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life." Despite the national influence and international recognition gained by the Salt Satyagraha, the salt tax remained until it was repealed by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the Prime Minister of the [[Interim Government of India|Interim Government]], in 1946.

'''''Jus post bellum''''' ([[Latin]] for "Justice after war") is a concept that deals with the morality of the termination phase of war.  The idea has some historical pedigree as a concept in just war theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orend|first=Brian|date=2000-01-01|title=Jus Post Bellum|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0047-2786.00034/abstract|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|language=en|volume=31|issue=1|pages=117–137|doi=10.1111/0047-2786.00034|issn=1467-9833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern times, it has been developed by a number of just war theorists and international lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Jus Post BellumMapping the Normative Foundations - Oxford Scholarship|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685899.001.0001/acprof-9780199685899|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199685899.001.0001/acprof-9780199685899}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the concept means different things to the contributors in each field.  For lawyers, the concept is much less clearly defined and many have rejected the usefulness of the concept altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/morality-jus-post-bellum-and-international-law/law-and-thejus-post-bellum/2DC1A66C84460B5F9D9B064467472BDF|title=Law and theJus Post Bellum: (Chapter 10) - Morality, Jus Post Bellum, and International Law|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Brian Orend]] is usually considered the initiator of the debate.  He argued that just war theory was incomplete in dealing only with the morality of using force (jus ad bellum) and the morality of conduct during war (jus in bello).  He said that a third branch of just war theory had been overlooked.  He cited Immanuel Kant as the first to consider a three-pronged approach to the morality of armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orend|first=Brian|date=2004|title=Kant's Ethics of War and Peace|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/BRIKEO|journal=Journal of Military Ethics|volume=3|issue=2|pages=161–177|doi=10.1080/15027570410006507}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Those interested in the ''jus post bellum'' must also consider the ''lex pacificatoria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=On the Law of PeacePeace Agreements and the Lex Pacificatoria - Oxford Scholarship|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199226832.001.0001/acprof-9780199226832|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199226832.001.0001/acprof-9780199226832}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Purpose==
The purpose of the concept and its usefulness depends on whether it is considered as a moral or a legal concept.  Its usefulness as a matter of law is very unclear.  As a concept in just war theory, the ''jus post bellum'' debate considers a number of issues. 

* Provide terms for the end of war; once the rights of a political community have been vindicated, further continuation of war becomes an act of aggression.
* Provide guidelines for the construction of peace treaties.
* Provide guidelines for the political reconstruction of defeated states.
* Prevent draconian and vengeful peace terms; the rights a just state fights for in a war provide the constraints on what can be demanded from the defeated belligerent.

The '''Legislatures of British India''' included [[legislative bodies]] in the [[presidencies and provinces of British India]], the [[Imperial Legislative Council]], the [[Chamber of Princes]] and the [[Central Legislative Assembly]]. The legislatures were created under [[Acts of Parliament]] of the United Kingdom. Initially serving as small advisory councils, the legislatures evolved into partially elected bodies, but were never elected through universal suffrage. Provincial legislatures saw boycotts during the period of [[diarchy|dyarchy]] between 1919 and 1935. After reforms and elections in 1937, the largest parties in provincial legislatures formed governments headed by a [[Prime Minister]]. A few British Indian subjects were elected to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which had superior powers than colonial legislatures. British Indian legislatures did not include [[Legislature of Burma|Burma's legislative assembly]] after 1937, the [[State Council of Ceylon]] nor the legislative bodies of [[princely state]]s.

==Advisory councils (1861-1919)==
Legislative councils were first formed in each province under the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]]. Members would include nominees of the Lieutenant Governor who had to receive consent from the [[Governor General of India]]. Native Indian subjects were a minority in the early councils, which were dominated by Europeans and [[Anglo-Indians]]. The Lieutenant Governor could nominate a maximum of 12 members to these councils, which did not have fixed term limits. The councils were merely advisory bodies for the provincial governments.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bengal_Legislative_Council |title=Bengal Legislative Council - Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Indian Councils Act 1892]], the legislative councils expanded to 20 members. The councils were empowered to address questions to the executive and discuss budgets without voting. The Lieutenant Governor would nominate 7 members from the recommendations of universities, city corporations, municipalities, district boards and chambers of commerce.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"/&gt; The majority of councilors continued to be European and a minority were Indian.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"/&gt; 

The [[Morley-Minto Reforms]] were the brainchild of [[John Morley]], the [[Secretary of State for India]], and [[Earl Minto]], the [[Viceroy of India]]. The reforms were enacted under the Indian Councils Act 1909, which brought amendments to the Acts of 1861 and 1892. However, they did not go as far as the demands for [[home rule]] put forward by the [[Indian National Congress]]. Colonial administrators were not keen to grant parliamentary powers to India, possibly for fear of subversion. Britain was also a [[unitary state]] and little power was given its regional or colonial units. Under the Act of 1909, the number of seats in legislative councils were expanded.&lt;ref name="Mishra1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vibhuti Bhushan Mishra|title=Evolution of the Constitutional History of India, 1773-1947: With Special Reference to the Role of the Indian National Congress and the Minorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RojLHsEv7FwC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-010-9|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Councils were established at the central level and for gubernatorial provinces. Under the reforms, the majority of councilors would be elected and a minority would be nominated from the government. Property owners, including the [[zamindar]]s, became [[voter]]s. [[Muslims]] were given the status of a "separate electorate". The Act increased the powers of legislative council to discuss budgets, suggest amendments and vote on limited matters. Representatives from plantations, commercial chambers, universities and landholders were given seats in the assembly. Education, local government, public health, public works, agriculture and cooperative societies were made "transferred subjects" to be administered by the elected representatives. The "reserved subjects" were to be administered by the Executive Council.

==Dyarchy (1919-1935)==
A [[diarchy|dyarchy]] is a system of shared government. In British India, the British government decided to share responsibilities with legislative councils in major provinces.
As a result of [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms]], the British government decided to gradually grant self-governing institutions to India. The [[Government of India Act, 1919]] established a [[bicameral]] central legislature and granted revenue shares to provincial legislative councils. The British government elaborated that the system would continue for at least 10 years until a review. The [[Swaraj Party]] and [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], which enjoyed majorities in the councils, boycotted the dyarchy- arguing that the reforms once again did not go far enough.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"/&gt; The Congress increased its non-cooperation movement. However, constitutionalists in parties like the [[All India Muslim League]] continued to advocate their constituents' interests within the councils.

The [[Rowlatt Act]], [[Amritsar massacre]] and [[Khilafat movement]] worsened the political situation.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"/&gt; In 1928, the [[Nehru Report]] called for a federal democracy. In 1929, the [[Fourteen Points of Jinnah]] demanded electoral, administrative and political reform. The [[Simon Commission]] was formed to explore constitutional reform.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"/&gt;

In 1932, the "[[Communal Award]]" was announced by [[British Prime Minister]] [[Ramsay MacDonald]] granting [[separate electorate]]s to [[Forward Caste]], [[Lower Caste]], [[Muslims]], [[Buddhists]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], [[Europeans]] and [[Dalit|Untouchables]] (now known as the [[Dalits]]) instead of equal universal franchise. The principle of weightage was also applied.&lt;ref&gt;Helen M. Nugent, "The communal award: The process of decision‐making." South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies 2#1-2 (1979): 112-129.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The award was highly controversial and criticized as a [[divide and rule]] policy.&lt;ref name="Thorpe2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edgar Thorpe|title=The Pearson CSAT Manual 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cruroSVFoUC&amp;pg=SL219-PA197|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-6734-4|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government opined that it wanted to avoid civil war.

==Provincial autonomy (1937-1947)==
{{See also|Indian provincial elections, 1937|Indian provincial elections, 1946}}
The [[Government of India Act, 1935]] ended dyarchy in the provinces and increased autonomy. Six provinces were given bicameral legislatures.&lt;ref name="banglapedia1"/&gt; Elections based on [[Communal Award|separate electorates]] were held in 1937 and 1946, leading to the formation of provincial ministries (governments) led by a Prime Minister.

Most of the provincial governments were unstable amid the outbreak of [[World War II]], the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and the [[Quit India movement]].

==British Indian MPs in Westminster==
A number of [[British Indian]]s and [[Anglo-Indian]]s were elected to the British parliament, particularly from the [[Parsi]] and [[Jewish]] communities. They included [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], [[Mancherjee Bhownagree]], [[Shapurji Saklatvala]], [[Philip Sassoon]] and [[Ernest Soares]].

==Chamber of Princes==
The [[Chamber of Princes]] was established by a proclamation of King [[George V]] in 1920. It was a forum for the rulers of princely states to air their views and engage with the colonial government. It was housed in the [[Sansad Bhawan|Parliament House]] and its meetings were presided over by the Viceroy of India.

==Successors and legacy==
{{See also|List of legislatures in South Asia}}
Prior to the [[Partition of British India]], the imperial legislature was succeeded by the [[Constituent Assembly of India]], from which the [[Interim Government of India]] headed by the [[Viceroy of India]] chose ministers in 1946. In the Dominion of Pakistan, the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]] succeeded the Indian assembly in 1947. In the provinces of both India and Pakistan, pre-partition assemblies continued to function. The assemblies of [[British Bengal|Bengal]] and [[British Punjab|the Punjab]] were divided between the newly formed sub-national units of East Bengal, West Bengal, East Punjab and West Punjab. The [[Parliament of India]] was established in 1952. The [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] was established in 1956. In 1971, secessionist Bengali legislators in East Pakistan formed a constituent assembly; and the [[Parliament of Bangladesh]] was established in 1972.

The legislatures of colonial British India were precursors to modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in the Indian subcontinent. The notion of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] took root in the subcontinent after independence, but has faced many challenges. [[President's rule]] is often imposed in Indian states to dismiss legislatures. India underwent a period of [[The Emergency (India)|emergency rule]] between 1975 and 1977. Pakistan has seen [[martial law]] and military rule between 1958-1962, 1969-1973, 1977-1985 and 1999-2002. Bangladesh underwent presidential rule, martial law and semi-presidential government between 1975 and 1990; while emergency rule was imposed between 2007 and 2008.

Today, the federal republic of [[India]] and [[States of India|its 29 states]]; the federal republic of [[Pakistan]] and its [[Provinces of Pakistan|four provinces]]; and the unitary republic of [[Bangladesh]]; all have parliamentary governments, largely derived from the [[Westminster]] tradition.

==Larry Wu-Tai Chin==
Larry Wu-Tai Chin worked in the U.S. intelligence community for nearly 35 years while providing China with classified information.&lt;ref&gt;Eftimiades, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Chin was recruited as a spy by a Chinese Communist official in 1948; an interpreter at the U.S. consulate in Shanghai,&lt;ref name=gs&gt;Global Security. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/world/china/mss-ops.htm "Ministry of State Security Operations."] (accessed March 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; he was later hired by the CIA’s Foreign Broadcast Information Service. After he became an American citizen in 1965 he was transferred to Arlington, Virginia, where he had access to reports from intelligence agents abroad and translations of documents acquired by CIA officers in China.&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; Chin sold classified [[National Intelligence Estimate]]s pertaining to China and Southeast Asia to China,&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; enabling the country to discover weaknesses in its intelligence agencies and compromise U.S. intelligence activities in the region.

=={{anchor|[[Peter Lee (scientist)|Peter Lee]]}}Peter Lee==
Lee, a physicist born in China who worked at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and later for [[TRW Inc.]], pleaded guilty to lying on security-clearance forms and passing classified national-defense information to Chinese scientists on business trips to Beijing.&lt;ref name=p&gt;Polmar, Norman and Thomas B. Allen, ''Spy Book: The Encyclopedia of Espionage,'' Second Edition, (New York, NY: Random House Reference, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; He compromised classified weapons information, microwave submarine-detection technology and other national-defense data,&lt;ref name=gs/&gt; and the Department of Energy later concluded that his disclosure of classified information "was of significant material assistance to the PRC in their nuclear weapons development program&amp;nbsp;... This analysis indicated that Dr. Lee's activities have directly enhanced the PRC nuclear weapons program to the detriment of U.S. national security."&lt;ref name=gs/&gt;

==Wen Ho Lee ==
[[Wen Ho Lee]] is a Taiwanese-American scientist who worked for the University of California at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. He created simulations of nuclear explosions for the purpose of scientific inquiry and to improve the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In December 1999, a federal grand jury indicted him of stealing secrets about the arsenal for China.

After federal investigators could not prove the initial accusations, the government conducted a separate investigation. It could only charge Lee with improper handling of restricted data, part of the original 59-count indictment to which he pleaded guilty as part of a [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargain]]. In June 2006, Lee received $1.6&amp;nbsp;million from the federal government and five media organizations as partial settlement of a civil suit he filed against them for leaking his name to the press before charges were filed against him. At the conclusion of the case, Presiding federal judge James A. Parker stated that he was misled "by the executive branch of our government through its Department of Justice, by its Federal Bureau of Investigation and by its United States attorney". The judge stated that while he couldn't speak on behalf of the executive branch "I sincerely apologize to you, Dr. Lee, for the unfair manner you were held in custody by the executive branch." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/14/us/statement-by-judge-in-los-alamos-case-with-apology-for-abuse-of-power.html/ |title= Statement by Judge in Los Alamos Case, With Apology for Abuse of Power|publisher=The New York Times |date=2000-09-14 |accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fei Ye and Ming Zhong==
Fei Ye, a U.S. citizen; and Ming Zhong, a permanent resident of the United States; were arrested at the San Francisco International Airport on November 23, 2001. They were accused of stealing trade secrets in designing a computer microprocessor to benefit China, although prosecutors did not allege that the Chinese government knew of their activities. In December 2002, they were charged with a total of ten counts, including conspiracy; economic espionage; possession of stolen trade secrets; and foreign transportation of stolen property. In 2006 (five years after their arrest), they pleaded guilty to two counts each of economic espionage. In 2008, they were sentenced to a year in prison. The maximum sentence is 30 years however prosecutors asked for less because of their cooperation. The case resulted in the first convictions under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2006/yePlea.htm |title=Two Men Plead Guilty to Stealing Trade Secrets from Silicon Valley Companies to Benefit China |publisher=justice.gov |date=2016-12-14 |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415113905/http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/press-releases/2006/yePlea.htm |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cnet.com/news/2-engineers-sentenced-for-espionage/ |title= 2 engineers sentenced for espionage|publisher=cnet.com |date=2008-11-22 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lan Lee and Yuefei Ge==
In 2007, two Silicon Valley engineers, Lan Lee and Yuefei Ge, were charged with economic espionage for stealing microchip design from NetLogic Microsystems, for the benefit of the Chinese military, the [[People's Liberation Army]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1564511/Spies-stole-secrets-to-arm-Chinese-military.html |title= Spies 'stole secrets' to arm Chinese military|publisher=telegraph.co.uk |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their indictment stated that the two formed a company named SICO Microsystems Inc. to facilitate the alleged theft with the possible involvement of the Chinese government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/27/AR2007092700782.html?noredirect=on |title= Two charged with espionage sought funding in China|publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their criminal trial started in October 2009. While prosecutors promised the jurors a "treasure trove" of evidence against the "traitors" and "spies", the defense stated the two just wanted to start their own company with their own ideas.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/10/21/san-jose-jury-hears-conflicting-stories-in-opening-of-espionage-trial/ |title= San Jose jury hears conflicting stories in opening of espionage trial|publisher=mercurynews.com |date=2009-10-21|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After a month long trial, a federal jury acquitted the two defendants on two counts and were leaning towards acquitting the two by a vote of 9:3 on two most serious counts of economic espionage. Jurors said the U.S. government failed to prove the NetLogic data was even a trade secret and much less aimed to benefit China. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.mercurynews.com/2009/11/20/federal-jury-deadlocks-on-most-of-espionage-case-against-two-silicon-valley-engineers/ |title= Federal jury deadlocks on most of espionage case against two Silicon Valley engineers|publisher=mercurynews.com |date=2009-11-20|accessdate=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On October 27, 2010, after years of ordeal, the indictment against Lee and Ge were dismissed in its entirety by U.S. District Judge James Ware. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/5758950/united-states-v-lee/?page=4 |title= AMENDED NOTICE OF DISMISSAL AND ORDER re 381 as to Lan Lee (1), Yuefei Ge (2), Count(s)As to BOTH defendants: Superseding Indictment; Count(s) 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, It is HEREBY ORDERED that the captioned indictment is DISMISSED with prejudice.

==Anne Lockwood, Michael Haehnel, and Fuping Liu==
In February 2009, three former employees of Metaldyne Corporation were sentenced to prison terms in federal court in connection with a conspiracy to steal confidential information from the company, according to Acting United States Attorney Terrence Berg. Anne Lockwood, formerly a Vice President for Sales at Metaldyne, her husband Michael Haehnel, formerly a senior engineer at Metaldyne, and Fuping Liu, a former metallurgist for Metaldyne.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/criminal-ccips/legacy/2012/03/15/lockwoodSent2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Lockwood and Liu both pleaded guilty on September 15, 2008 to the main count of the Indictment, conspiracy to steal confidential and proprietary information belonging to Metaldyne, and using the stolen information in order to assist a Chinese competitor, the Chongqing Huafu Industry Company, (“Huafu”) of Chongqing, China to compete against Metaldyne in the field of powdered metal parts. Haehnel pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense charging him with unlawfully accessing stored electronic records.&lt;ref&gt;https://westerfunk.net/archives/security/FBI%20goes%20on%20offensive%20against%20China's%20tech%20spies/&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in May 2004, Lockwood and Liu developed a business plan to help Huafu compete against Metaldyne in the production of powdered metal products. Lockwood obtained both electronic and paper copies of confidential and proprietary information pertaining to Metaldyne’s internal costs and its manufacturing processes, and then provided some of that information to Huafu, in China, to assist it in competing against Metaldyne. Lockwood received 30 months in prison, Haehnel received 6 months in prison, and Liu received 9 months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2009/02/rockford_woman_sentenced_to_pr.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bo Jiang==

{{Fascism sidebar|expanded=Topics}}
This article discusses regimes and movements that have described themselves as [[fascism|fascist]], or are alleged to have been fascist or sympathetic to fascism.

It is often a matter of dispute whether a certain government is to be characterized as fascist (radical authoritarian nationalism), authoritarian, totalitarian, or a police state. The term "fascism" itself is controversial, and has been defined in various ways by different authors. Many of the regimes and movements discussed in this article can be considered fascist according to some definitions but not according to others. See [[definitions of fascism]] for more information on that subject.

==The Axis (1922-1945)==

===Italy (1922–1943)===
{{main|Italian Fascism}}
The first fascist country, Italy, was ruled by [[Benito Mussolini]] (''Il Duce'') until he was dismissed and arrested on 25 July 1943. Mussolini was then rescued from prison by the [[Wehrmacht]], and set up a short-lived puppet state named "[[Italian Social Republic|Repubblica di Salò]]" in northern Italy under the protection of the [[Wehrmacht]].

===Germany (1933–1945)===
{{main|Nazism}}
The [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (Nazis) came to power in Germany as a minority party when its leader, [[Adolf Hitler]], was named [[chancellor#Germany|chancellor]] following the elections of 1933. Hitler moved swiftly to consolidate power, first through passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]]. After the death of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in 1934, the entire power of the German state was concentrated in Hitler's hands.

The German National socialists were known for their use of thuggery and intimidation of political opponents and dissenters, including outright persecution of the country's Jewish citizenry, resulting in the [[Holocaust]]. Nonetheless, they were widely popular among many segments of the German population, particularly the working class, for their perceived success in reversing the nation's economic decline.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig von Mises ([1940], 1998). Interventionism: An Economic Analysis, trans. Thomas Francis McManus and Heinrich Bund, ed. Bettina Bien Greaves. Irvington-on-Hudson, NY: Foundation for Economic Education, Inc. {{ISBN|1-57246-071-7}} p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; One of Hitler's cornerstone policies was known as [[Lebensraum]], which served as the rationale for Germany's expansionist foreign policy and ultimately led to the [[World War II|Second World War]].

===Japan (1931–1945)===
{{Main|Statism in Shōwa Japan}}
Right-wing elements in Japan, including industrialists, military officers, and the nobility, had long opposed democracy as an anathema to national unity. Military cliques began to dominate the national government starting in the 1930s. A major militarist nationalist movement in Japan from the 1920s to the 1930s was the [[Imperial Way Faction]] "''Kodoha''" of which future wartime Prime Minister [[Hideki Tōjō]] was a part. In 1936, Japan and Germany signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], aimed at countering the Soviet Union and the [[Comintern|Communist International]]. In 1940, Prime Minister [[Fumimaro Konoye]] established the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]], or [[Taisei Yokusankai]], to consolidate all political parties under a single umbrella group. That same year, Japan joined Germany and Italy in the [[Tripartite Pact]].

==Other countries==

===Austria (1933–1945)===
{{main|Austro-fascism}}
[[Engelbert Dollfuß]]'s idea of a "Ständestaat" was borrowed from Mussolini. Dollfuß dissolved parliament and established a clerical-fascist dictatorship which lasted until Austria was incorporated into [[Nazi Germany]] through the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of 1938.

===Brazil (1937–1945)===
Many historians have argued that Brazil's [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] under [[Getúlio Vargas]] was a Brazilian variant of the continental fascist regimes. Briefly, Vargas' regime was aligned with [[Plínio Salgado]]'s [[Integralismo|Integralist Party]], Brazil's fascist movement. Vargas launched a cult of personality that endures to this day, on top of the "Worker's Rights" (such as the rights to vacations and minimal wage) being extremely similar to Mussonili's own "Worker's Rights". Criticism on whether the government was fascist or not derives from the fact that Vargas followed the [[Castilhismo]] ideology, which is strongly Positivist, incompatible with Fascism's metaphysical, traditionalist, almost [[Julius Evola|occultist]] ideas.

===Chile (1932-1938)===
In Chile, during the 1930s, there was a [[fascist]]-[[nazism|nazi]] party named [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] (MNS), ruled by [[Jorge González von Marées]], an [[Adolf Hitler]] sympathizer. However, the MNS was dissolved in 1938.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

===Republic of China (1932–1938; 1941-1945)===
In the 1930s, an elitist group around [[Chiang Kai-shek]] looked to fascism as a "quick" solution to the modernization of China. The [[Blue Shirts Society]] (藍衣社 in Chinese, hereinafter referred to as the BSS), was a secret clique in the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party). Under the direction of Chiang Kai-shek it sought to lead the KMT and China by following the ideology of Fascism and was a secret police or para-military force.

Chiang Kai-shek was confident in his goal to modernize China through an essentially Western method (fascism) and his ability to use it as an instrument while molding it into a Confucianist philosophy. His ideas were given shape by the Blueshirts – in effect an elitist organization within the Kuomintang government structure. This organization practiced the ancient Chinese theory of "knowledge and action" in order to inspire the Chinese people.

Likewise, the more left-wing though politically syncretic faction of the Kuomintang led by [[Wang Jingwei]], which split from the mainline right-wing faction of the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, gradually embraced and espoused increasingly fascist oriented positions, including anti-communist doctrine. This eventually led to their recognition by members of the [[Axis Powers]], including Germany and Italy, when Wang Jingwei's faction of the Kuomintang gained prominence and assumed control of a [[China-Nanjing|puppet regime]] based in [[Nanjing]] established in 1941 by forces of the invading Japanese military.

===Croatia (1941–1945)===
''Poglavnik'' [[Ante Pavelić]], leader of the infamous [[Ustaše]] movement, came to power in 1941 as the Croatian puppet leader under the control of Nazi Germany. Under the indirect control of Germany, the Ustaše regime was based heavily upon both upon clerical fascism and the Italian model of fascism, with elements of racial integrity and organic nationalism drawn from Nazism.

===Finland (1929–1932)===
The [[Lapua Movement]], established in 1929, originally a nationalist movement that opposed Sweden and Russia, turned into a fascist movement in the early 1930s. However, the party's origins could date back to the early 1920s, in [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] forces during the [[Finnish Civil War]]. They attempted a coup d'état in 1932, after which the movement was banned. The Lapua Movement, however, affected the selection of [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] as the [[President of Finland|president]] and the passing of extensive anti-communist laws. Finland stayed a democracy throughout World War II, despite co-operating with [[Nazi Germany]].

===France (1940–1944)===
The [[Vichy regime]] of [[Philippe Pétain]], established following France's defeat by Germany, collaborated with the Nazis. However, the minimal importance of fascists in the government until its direct occupation by Germany makes it appear to seem more similar to the regime of Franco or Salazar than the model fascist powers. While it has been argued that anti-Semitic raids performed by the Vichy regime were more in the interests of pleasing Germany than in service of ideology, anti-semitism was a full component of the "National Revolution" ideology of Vichy.

As early as October 1940 the Vichy regime introduced the infamous ''statut des Juifs'', that produced a new legal definition of Jewishness and which barred Jews from certain public offices. They interned Liberals, Communists, Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals,  in [[concentration camps in France|concentration camps]] as soon as 1940.

Also, in May 1941 the Parisian police force had collaborated in the internment of foreign Jews. As a means of identifying Jews, the German authorities required all Jews in the occupied zone to wear a [[yellow badge]]. On the 11 June, they demanded that 100,000 Jews be handed over for deportation.

The most infamous of these mass arrests was the so-called [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]] (''Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv'') which took place in Paris on the 16 and 17 July 1942. The Vélodrome d'Hiver was a large [[cycle track]] situated on the rue Nélaton near the Quai de Grenelle in the 15th arrondissement of Paris. In a vast operation codenamed "Spring Breeze" (''Vent printanier''), the French police rounded up 13,152 Jews from Paris and its surrounding suburbs. These were mostly adult men and women however approximately 4,000 children were among them. Identifications for the arrests were made easier by the large number of files on Jews complied and held by Vichy authorities since 1940. The French police, headed by [[René Bousquet]], were entirely responsible for this operation and no German soldiers assisted. [[Pierre Laval]], head of Vichy, included the children in the deportations to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] against general German orders. Most of the deportees sealed in the transports died en route due to lack of food or water. The few survivors were sent to the gas chambers. A few months later, a police operation took place in Marseille, known as the [[Battle of Marseille]], and led to massive raids in the so-called "free zone", administrated by Vichy.

===Greece (1936–1941)===

[[Ioannis Metaxas]]' 1936 to 1941 dictatorship was partly fascist in its ideological nature, and might hence be characterized as quasi-fascist or authoritarian. It had a [[Ethniki Organosi Neolaias|National Youth Organisation]] based on the [[Hitlerjugend]], developed an armamentistic-centered economy, established a police-state akin to that of [[Nazi Germany]] (Greece received tactical and material support from [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], who exchanged correspondence with the Greek Minister of State Security [[Konstantinos Maniadakis]]) and brutality against communists in big cities such as Athens(communism was not known at small towns and villages of Greece yet). The Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]]' 1967 to 1974 military dictatorship, which was supported by the United States, however, was less ideological and lacked a clear fascist element other than militarism.

===Hungary (1932–1945)===
By 1932, support for right-wing ideology, embodied by [[Prime Minister]] [[Gyula Gömbös]], had reached the point where Hungarian Regent [[Miklós Horthy]] could not postpone appointing a fascist prime minister. Horthy also showed signs of admiring the efficiency and conservative leanings of the Italian fascist state under Mussolini and was not too reluctant to appoint a fascist government (with terms for the extent of Horthy's power). Horthy would keep control over the mainstream fascist movement in Hungary until near the end of the Second World War. However, Gömbös never had a truly powerful fascist base of support. Instead, the radical [[Arrow Cross|Arrow Cross Party]], which gained support in Budapest as well as the countryside, became a powerful political movement, gaining nearly 800,000 votes in the election of 1939. Horthy became paranoid due to his new rival, and imprisoned the Arrow Cross Party's leader, [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. However, this action only increased popular support for the fascist movement. In another attempt to challenge the Arrow Cross, Horthy's government began to imitate the Arrow Cross Party's ideology. Starting in 1938, several racial laws, mostly against [[Jews]], were passed by the regime, but the extremist Arrow Cross Party, led by Ferenc Szálasi, was banned until German pressure lifted the law, and until Germany occupied Hungary during [[Operation Margarethe]] on March 19, 1944, no Jews were in direct danger of being annihilated. In July 1944, armor-colonel Ferenc Koszorús and the First Armour Division, under Horthy's orders, resisted the Arrow Cross militia and prevented the deportation of the Jews of Budapest, thus saved over 200,000 lives. This act impressed upon the German occupying forces, including [[Adolf Eichmann]], that as long as Hungary continued to be governed by Horthy, no real ''Endlösung'' could begin. Following Horthy's attempt to have Hungary change sides on October 13, Szálasi, with German military support, launched [[Operation Panzerfaust]] and replaced Admiral Horthy as Head of State. The regime changed to a system more in line with Nazism and would remain this way until the capture of Budapest by Soviet troops. Over 400,000 Jews were sent by Hungary to German death camps from 1944 to 1945.

===Norway (1943–1945)===
[[Vidkun Quisling]] had staged a ''[[coup d'état]]'' during the German invasion on April 9, 1940. This first government was replaced by a Nazi puppet government under his leadership from February 1, 1943. His party never had any substantial support in Norway, undermining his attempts to emulate the Italian fascist state.

===Portugal (1932–1974)===
The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] borrowed many of the ideas towards military and governance from Mussolini's Fascist regime and adapted to the Spanish example of paternal iconography for authoritarianism. Even though the regime was supportive of Mussolini and Hitler's efforts, it kept on the political sidelines throughout the war and instead offered only aid and business with both Italy and Germany during this period.

===Poland (1930s)===
During the 1930s, the rise of fascist-inspired organizations occurred in Poland. Fascist organizations like the Association of Polish Fascists (Związek Faszystów Polskich) were however marginal and ephemeral. Fascist-inspired organizations were however stronger than parties with clearly fascist programs. [[National Radical Camp Falanga]] was the most prominent of them. It was created by radical youth members with [[National Democracy|National Democratic]] origins. Falanga was nonetheless quickly banned by the authoritarian ruling [[Sanacja]] regime and continued to operate clandestinely. It was also involved in frequent street violence and anti-Semitic riots.

===Romania (1940–1944)===
The [[Iron Guard]] turned more and more into a pro-Nazi and pro-German movement and took power in September 1940 when [[Ion Antonescu]] forced King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] to abdicate. However, the cohabitation between the Iron Guard and [[Ion Antonescu]] was short-lived.

During the 1930s, the group combined a mix of [[Christian]] faith, [[antisemitism]], and calls for [[land reform]] for [[farmers]], who still lived in a quasi-[[feudal]] society. However, the extremely violent nature of the movement made it difficult for the Iron Guard to attract [[conservatism|conservatives]] and [[middle class]] people, and as a result, the movement could never be as successful as the [[Nazi Party]].

The Antonescu regime that followed had elements of fascism, but it lacked a clear political program or party. It was more a [[military dictatorship]]. The regime was characterized by nationalism, antisemitism, and anti-communism, but had no social program. Despite the [[Iaşi pogrom]] and a near-liquidation of the Jews of many parts of [[Moldavia]], the regime ultimately refused to send the Romanian Jews to German death camps. The regime was overthrown on 23 August 1944 in a coup led by the king [[Mihai of Romania]].

===Slovakia (1939–1944)===
The [[Slovak People's Party]] was a quasi-fascist nationalist movement. It was associated with the Roman Catholic Church and founded by Father [[Andrej Hlinka]]. His successor Monsignor [[Jozef Tiso]] was a president of nominally independent Slovakia in 1939–1945. His government colleagues like Vojtech Tuka or Alexander Mach collaborate with fascism. The clerical element lends comparison with Austrofascism or the clerical fascism of Croatia, though not to the excesses of either model. The market system was run on principles agreeing with the standard Italian fascist model of industrial regulation.

===Spain (1936–1975)===
After the 1936 arrest and execution of its founder, [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], during the Spanish Civil War, the fascist [[Falange]] Española Party was allied to and ultimately came to be dominated by Generalísimo [[Francisco Franco]], who became known as ''El Caudillo'', the undisputed leader of the Nationalist side in the war and, after victory, head of state until his death over 35 years later. However, it was best described as an autocracy based on the Falangist fascist principles in its early years. By the mid-1950s, the [[Spanish Miracle]] and the rise of [[Opus Dei]] in the Franco regime led to Falangist fascism being discarded and fascists minimized in importance.

===South Africa===
There have been three waves of fascism in South Africa. Beginning with D F Malan's support of Hitler's brown shirts and the activities of [[Robey Leibbrandt]] in the 1930s and 1940s, the second wave during the 1970s and 1980s which created fringe right-wing groups such as the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]].

=== Yugoslavia (1935–1945) ===
[[Yugoslav Radical Union]] was a Yugoslav fascist group run by [[Milan Stojadinović]]. Party members wore green shirt uniforms, addressed Stojadinović as ''Vodja'' and used the [[Roman salute]]. The party was dissolved following the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]]

==Fascism in democratic nations==
Prior to World War II, fascist or quasi-fascist movements also appeared in democratic nations, often taking their inspiration from the regimes established by Mussolini and Hitler.

===Australia (1931 – late 1930s)===
The [[New Guard]] attempted to violently remove New South Wales Premier [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] from office.

===Canada (1930s–1940)===
In the 1930s, Canada had fascist fringe groups within it. One stronger group was the ''[[Parti national social chrétien]]''  of [[Adrien Arcand]] which had significant support. Arcand believed in the anti-Semitic policies of Hitler and called himself the "Canadian Führer". In 1934, his Quebec-based party merged with the western-based fascist [[Nationalist Party of Canada]]. In 1938, the [[English Canadian]] and [[French Canadian]] fascist movements united into the National Unity Party. The only fascist politician ever to be elected in Canada was a man by the name of P. M. Campbell who ran and won under the fascist [[Unity Party of Alberta]] for [[Lethbridge]] in a [[List of Alberta by-elections#8th Legislative Assembly of Alberta 1935-1940|1937 Alberta Provincial By-Election]]. In 1940, all fascist parties were banned under Canada's [[War Measures Act]].

===Belgium (1930s–1945)===
{{main|Rexism}}
The [[Rexism|Rexist]] movement and the [[Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond]] party achieved some electoral success in the 1930s. The party could be label as [[clerical fascism|clerical fascist]] with its roots in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Conservatism]]. The party gained rapid support for a brief period, focusing on the secularism, corruption, and ineffectiveness on [[parliamentary democracy]] in Belgium. Many of its members assisted the Nazi occupation during World War II. The [[Verdinaso]] movement, too, can be considered fascist. Its leader, [[Joris Van Severen]], was killed before the Nazi occupation. Some of its adepts collaborated, but others joined the [[Resistance movement|resistance]]. These collaborationist movements are generally classified as belonging to the National Socialist model or the German fascist model because of its brand of racial nationalism and the close relation with the occupational authorities.

===Ireland (1932–1933)===
Fascist sympathizers led by General [[Eoin O'Duffy]] established the [[Army Comrades Association]], or "Blueshirts" in 1932 as a veterans organization. Renamed the National Guard, it eventually became the paramilitary wing of the United Ireland Party. The Blueshirts wanted to establish a corporate state in Ireland and frequently clashed with Republican supporters of the ruling [[Fianna Fáil]], who were using force to disrupt that party's meetings. O’Duffy planned a parade in Dublin in 1933, and the government, fearing a coup, banned the organization. The organization began to decline soon after. Blueshirts under O’Duffy's leadership later fought for Franco during the Nationalist uprising in Spain.

===Mexico (1930–1942)===
A reactionary nationalist movement called Acción Revolucionaria Mexicana (Mexican Revolutionary Action), founded by former Villista general [[Nicolas Rodriguez Carrasco]], agitated for right-wing causes, such as the deportation of Jews and Chinese-Mexicans, throughout the 1930s. ARM maintained a paramilitary force called the [[Goldshirts]], which clashed frequently with Communist activists, and supported the presidential faction of [[Plutarco Calles]] against the liberal reformist president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]]. The paramilitary group was banned in 1936 and the ARM officially disbanded in 1942, when Mexico declared war against the Axis.

===The Netherlands (1923–1945)===
The ''Verbond van Actualisten'' (Union of Actualists) was the oldest fascist movement in the Netherlands. It was established on 22 January 1923 and its ideology was based on Mussolini's Italian fascist movement. It ceased all activities in November 1928 after having had no success at all. It was succeeded by the ''Vereeniging De Bezem'' (Association 'The Broom') which was founded on 15 December 1928 by some men who previously were active in the ''Verbond van Actualisten''. Its aim was to clean Dutch politics – hence the name. Its downfall in 1932 was caused by continuous discord between its leaders. On 14 December 1931 [[Anton Mussert]] and [[Cornelis van Geelkerken]] founded the ''[[Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging|Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging in Nederland]]'' (NSB), the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands. It started as a fascist movement, Italian style, but at the same time its ideology was based on [[Hitler]]s [[NSDAP]]. In the years 1935–1936 the party embraced [[antisemitism]]. Its best pre-war election result was 7,9% of the voters (1935). The maximum number of member of the NSB was 100,000 (around 1,25% of the Dutch population). Soon after the German occupation in May 1940 the NSB became the only allowed political party. Never once during the years of WW II the NSB was giving any real power, instead, the Germans used the NSB for their own purposes. After the German defeat, the NSB disappeared. On 29 June 1932 [[Jan Baars]] (previously active in the ''Vereeniging 'De Bezem''') founded the ''Algemeene Nederlandsche Fascisten Bond'' (General Dutch Fascist Federation). It was the first Dutch fascist political party to gain significant election results and it had a considerable number of members. Its political views were quite moderate and it disapproved German Nazi [[racism]] and antisemitism. It ended its existence in 1934. Its main successful successor was ''Zwart Front'' (Black Front), 1934–1941. Its leaders were of a Catholic origin and the party was strongly based on Italian fascism. During the pre-war period, it never established a prominent position like Mussert's NSB. After the German invasion in May 1940, the number of members rose from 4,000 to 12,000. The Germans prohibited ''Zwart Front'' in December 1941.

Other, smaller, fascist and Nazi parties were: ''Verbond van Nationalisten'' (Union of Nationalists, 1928–1934), the ''Nationaal-Socialistische Nederlandsche Arbeiders Partij'' (National Socialist Dutch Workers Party, 1931–1941), ''Nationaal-Socialistische Partij'' (National Socialist Party, 1932–1941), ''Nederlandsche Fascisten Unie'' (Dutch Fascist Union, 1933), ''Unie van Nederlandsche Fascisten'' (Union of Dutch Fascists, 1933), ''Oranje-Fascisten'' (Orange Fascists, 1933), ''Frysk Fascisten Front'' (Frisian Fascist Front, 1933), ''Corporatieve Concentratie'' (Corporative Concentration, 1933–1934), ''Verbond voor Nationaal Herstel'' (Union for National Restoration, 1933–1941), ''Nederlandsche Nationaal-Socialistische Partij'' (Dutch National Socialist Party, 1935) and the ''Nederlandsche Volkspartij'' (Dutch People's Party, 1938–1940).

Dutch fascism and Nazism is known for its lack of coherence and it was dominated by the egos of its leaders. An important fact for its marginal position in pre-war Dutch politics was the absence of a 'lost generation' of combatants of WW I.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], the [[Kataeb Party]] (Phalange) was formed in 1936, with inspiration of the Spanish [[Falange]] and [[Italian Fascism]]. The founder of the party, [[Pierre Gemayel]], founded the party after returning from a visit at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. The party is still active today, although it has abandoned the Falangist and Fascist ideology in place of Phoenicianism, social Conservatism, Republicanism, and anti-Islam.

===Sweden (1926–1929)===
The [[National Socialist People's Party of Sweden|''Sveriges Fascistiska Folkparti'']] (''SFF''; "Fascist People's Party of Sweden") was founded in 1926.  Major figures of the party included its founding leader, Konrad Hallgren, a former German officer, and Swedish soldiers [[Sven Olov Lindholm]] and [[Sven Hedengren]].

In 1929 a delegation of the party, led by Hallgren and Lindholm, attended a major rally of the [[NSDAP|German Nazi party]], at Nuremberg. Afterwards, the ''SFF'' was more strongly influenced by Nazism and changed its name to [[National Socialist People's Party of Sweden|''Sveriges Nationalsocialistiska Folkparti'']] (''SNF''; Swedish National Socialist People's Party). The ''SNF'' was one of several [[Swedish Nazi]] parties.

===United Kingdom (1932–1940)===
[[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]], an admirer of [[Mussolini]], established the [[British Union of Fascists]] in 1932 as a nationalist alternative to the three mainstream political parties in Britain. Though the BUF achieved only limited success in some local elections, their existence caused frequent riots, usually instigated by Communist movements. Alarmed at the violence caused by the BUF, the government passed the [[Public Order Act 1936|Public Order Act]] in 1936 to restrict its activity. During the latter years of the decade, the party experienced a revival in popularity on the back of its anti-war campaign. The BUF was banned in 1940 and Mosley was interned for the duration of the war. The relative stability of democratic institutions, the long-time assimilation of [[Jews]], and the lack of a strong, threatening Communist movement, had made it difficult for fascism to succeed in [[UK|Britain]].

===United States of America (1933-1941)===
The [[Silver Legion of America]] (1933-1941), claiming around 15,000 members, managed to run a candidate for President on a third-party ticket, but was outlawed after [[Nazi Germany]]'s declaration of war on the United States in late 1941.

==Differences among fascist movements==
Despite the arousal of [[fascist]] movements across Europe and the world, many were different in their nature in ideology. Some like the [[Iron Guard]] and [[Arrow Cross Party]] had strong support among the [[proletariat]], unlike [[Nazism]] and [[Italian Fascism]], which relied more on the support of the middle class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Meanwhile, some regimes, especially those appointed by [[Hitler]] like [[Vichy France]], was made up of the [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] elite. Others also had different degrees of [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] elements.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Some groups, like the ones in [[Croatia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], and [[Slovakia]], had its roots in [[reactionary]] and [[populism|populist]] [[Political Catholicism|Catholicism]]. The [[Iron Guard]] also had strong religious influences and was defined, by its leaders, as more of a religious order than a [[political party]]. Fascist leaders like [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Vidkun Quisling]] tried to stage direct military coups, while other fascist groups formed political parties and tried to take power through the existing democratic process, such as [[Oswald Mosley]]'s [[British Union of Fascists]].

'''Malaysian Wildlife Law''' ({{lang-ms|Undang-Undang Hidupan Liar Malaysia}}) consists of the regulation, protection, conservation and management of [[wildlife]] in Malaysia. The [[Constitution of Malaysia]] empowers those at the federal and the states level to make laws regarding wildlife resources. As such, eleven states in peninsular are managed under an act while [[Sabah]] enacted an enactment and [[Sarawak]] an ordinance.

==Precursor to the Federal Wildlife Act==
A Wildlife Commission of Malaya was established by the British colonists in 1932 to make full inquiry into existing regulations for protection of wildlife; ways to deal with wildlife damage to agriculture; and the organisation needed to administer the preservation of wildlife. Some of the major recommendations of the report were:

*Appointment of Commissioner for Wildlife and another for National Parks
*Establishment of Taman Negara and Krau Game Reserve
*Open and close hunting seasons
*Total ban on wildlife commercialisation
*Appointment of honorary Deputy Wildlife Officers, wildlife rangers as guardian of forest and wildlife
*Conservation and management of riverine fish
*Establishment of Wildlife Fund.

The report provided the framework for the consolidation of the state game offices and establishment of the Wildlife Ordinance 1955 in Malayan States. Later, the 1955 Ordinance was repealed with the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 by the Malaysia Parliament. The 1972 Act enable for the federalisation of all state wildlife departments and appointment of the Director-General of [[Department of Wildlife and National Parks]] (DWNP).
 
===List of DWNP Directors-General===
* Mr Bernard Thong
* Mr Mohd Khan Bin Momin Khan
* Dato' Musa Nordin
* Dato' Abd Rashid Samsuddin

'''Maplin Electronics''', trading as '''Maplin''', was a [[retailer]] of electronic goods in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In June 2017, there were 217 Maplin stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.maplin.co.uk/Help.aspx?HelpPageID=205#anclocator |title=Help Centre |work=Maplin |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also operated an extensive online, telephone and mail order service.

On 28 February 2018, Maplin went into [[Administration in United Kingdom law|administration]], placing 2,500 jobs at risk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43223175|title=Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail|date=28 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=28 February 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 25 June 2018 all Maplin stores ceased trading.&lt;ref&gt;Internal Memo through Fuse.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Final Closedown 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/bdf03d40-5c24-11e8-9334-2218e7146b04 |title=UK High Street Braces For More Store Closures |last= |first= |date=20 May 2018 |website=[[Financial Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=26 May 2018 |quote= |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Final Closedown 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/962650/maplin-uk-store-closure-retailers-collapsed-administration |title=Maplin Will Shut Last Of Its 219 Stores By July |last=Ho |first=Geoff |date=20 May 2018 |website=[[Daily Express]] |publisher=Express Newspapers |accessdate=26 May 2018 |quote=COLLAPSED electronics retailer Maplin will shut the last of its 219 stores by July, according to sources familiar with the situation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Final Closedown 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/business/wyvern-retail-park-derby-struggling-1591154 |title=Is The Concept Of The Out-Of-Town Retail Park Now Dead? |last=Johnson |first=Robin |date=22 May 2018 |website=[[Derby Telegraph]] |publisher=Local World |accessdate=26 May 2018 |quote=The Maplin store at the Wyvern Retail Park is set to close after the firm went into administration earlier this year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Maplin-box1-134x60.png|thumb|Former Maplin Electronics logo]]

===Founding===
'''Maplin Electronic Supplies''' was established in 1972 as a mail order business by Roger and Sandra Allen and Doug Simmons. The company started in a bedroom at the Allens' home in [[Rayleigh, Essex]], after the two electronics enthusiasts were disappointed by the complexity and poor availability of existing electronic component suppliers.

The trio placed an advertisement in an electronics magazine, after printing the company's first 28-page catalogue, which would be offered free to callers. Despite a slow start and dwindling profit in the first year, the company began to gain a reputation for first grade electronic components delivered exactly as shown in the catalogue by first-class post.

===First stores===
[[File:Stoke-town-104 (4951933014).jpg|thumb|Maplin store in [[Stoke on Trent]] using the previous logo]]
The first store opened in [[Westcliff-on-Sea]] and the mail order department moved into the rooms above the shop. Sales received a boost when Maplin was invited to take prime advertising space in [[IPC (electronics)|IPC Electronics]] magazines after the latter received complaints against some of their existing advertisers.

A second store opened in [[Hammersmith]] by the end of the year. The mail order side of the business had outgrown the space available above the [[Westcliff-on-Sea]] store and an ex-dairy building in [[Hadleigh, Essex|Hadleigh]] was purchased and established as Maplin's first warehouse.

Maplin had already started designing electronic kits for hobbyists and musicians, with several synthesiser and organ projects being published in the first magazine, ''Electronics &amp; Music Maker'', and subsequently made available as kits. After the second store opened ''Electronics – the Maplin Magazine'' was launched and initially published every quarter, then monthly as more projects were designed.

The concurrent boom in home computer ownership in the early 1980s spawned by manufacturers such as [[Clive Sinclair|Sinclair]], [[Commodore International]] and [[Atari]] created opportunities for Maplin. They produced home build project kits such as speech synthesisers, memory expansion cards, extension keyboards, cables, and connectors to plug into these computers.

At the height of production of the home build kits Maplin's range was vast, with in-house designed power amplifiers, radio kits, a weather station and a full weather satellite receiving and display system and many others, as well as the [[Heathkit]] and [[Velleman]] ranges of kits. The catalogue, with its distinctive science fiction cover art by Lionel Jeans, contained hundreds of application circuits and hundreds of thousands of copies were distributed each year.

==Expansion==
===Move to South Yorkshire===
[[File:Maplin - Westgate Retail Park - geograph.org.uk - 1217687.jpg|thumb|Maplin store in Westgate Retail Park, [[Wakefield]]]]
In 1985, Maplin Professional Supplies was created to serve the expanding business market with a catalogue of products selected specifically for professionals and the business market. In 1989, a new National Distribution Centre was opened at [[Wombwell]], [[South Yorkshire]], and four years later a Far Eastern headquarters was established in Taiwan.

By 1994, Maplin had a turnover of more than £29 million a year, and it was clear&lt;ref name="addleshawgoddard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.addleshawgoddard.com/view.asp?content_id=1333&amp;parent_id=968 |title=Addleshaw Goddard Advises Management on £244 Million Sale of Maplin Electronics |work=[[Addleshaw Goddard]] |year=2015 |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; more help was needed to organise the business. In December 1994, Maplin was acquired by [[Saltire PLC]].&lt;ref name="addleshawgoddard"/&gt;

In 1999, Maplin launched its own website, and the following year sales from the site hit UK £1million. The [[Southend-on-Sea]] headquarters also closed in 2000, and all operations were moved to Wombwell. In June 2001, the company changed hands again, this time with a management buyout backed by [[Graphite Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graphitecapital.com/cs_maplin.html |title=Maplin Electronics |publisher=Graphite Capital |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101212834/http://www.graphitecapital.com/cs_maplin.html |archivedate=1 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Far East operations===
Maplin Far East Operations was first established in 1992&lt;ref name="maplin.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maplin.co.uk/help-centre?helppageid=24 |title=Help Centre |work=Maplin |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Maplin Electronics set up its first Far Eastern branch office in Taipei, Taiwan to strengthen buying power.

The office was in charge of product sourcing, purchasing, inspecting, shipping and payment arrangement from Taiwan and was known as the Far East Operations Centre. The Hong Kong Office followed in 1995&lt;ref name="maplin.co.uk" /&gt; to handle the sourcing, purchasing and shipping from Hong Kong.

As most production in Taiwan and Hong Kong had moved to [[mainland China]], the company registered a representative office in [[Shenzhen]] under the Hong Kong Office in 2004. The three offices in the Far East handled more than 500 suppliers and 5,000 buying items for the parent company.

The major product categories included cables, power supplies, electronics components, kits and tools, communication equipment, computers, toys, automotive electronics, and consumer electronics.

===Acquisition by Saltire===
In December 1994, the private equity firm [[Saltire plc]] acquired Maplin Electronics from its founders, with the intention of merging its operations with another electronics distribution business in its portfolio, Altai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/saltire-turnover-profit-up-156075425.html |title=Saltire Turnover, Profit Up |date=16 April 1996 |work=[[PR Newswire]] |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by Graphite Capital===
In June 2001, [[Graphite Capital]] led the £41 million management buy-out of Maplin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.graphitecapital.com/sectors-and-portfolio/maplin/|title=Maplin |work=[[Graphite Capital]] |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by Montagu===
In September 2004, [[Montagu Private Equity]] purchased 67% of Maplin from Graphite Capital at a cost of £244&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.montagupe.com/news/?id=734 Montagu Private Equity announces UK£244 million acquisition of Maplin Electronics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714112841/http://www.montagupe.com/news/?id=734 |date=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the company began to relocate its headquarters and distribution centre to a new facility at Brookfields Park, on the former [[Manvers Main Colliery]], [[Rotherham]], just two miles from the old warehouse in Wombwell. Maplin discontinued the processing of orders outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland in January 2010.

Later in 2010, Montagu said they were evaluating their options with Maplin, because the value of their investment has been realised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/7978520/Maplin-Electronics-may-change-hands-for-400m.html |title=Maplin Electronics may change hands for £400m |first=Ben |last=Harrington |date=3 September 2010 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was envisaged that when the market conditions were right, Maplin would float on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name="Internal Memo"&gt;Internal Memo&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debt free===
At the end of 2012, Maplin announced it was officially out of debt from their creditor Montague Equity.&lt;ref name="Internal Memo"/&gt;

===Drop ship vending===
In June 2013, Maplin introduced [[Drop shipping|drop ship vending]], allowing them to offer a far greater range of stock for sale online than available in-store.

===Acquisition by Rutland Partners===
In March 2014, Montagu Private Equity put Maplin up for sale with an expected return of between £100 million and £200 million. On 27 June 2014, Rutland Partners announced they were acquiring Maplin from Montagu for £85 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rutlandpartners.com/news-and-media.html?id=101 |title=Investment in Maplin Electronics By Rutland Partners |work=Rutland Partners |date=27 June 2014 |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rutland typically focuses on restructuring opportunities, "special situation" investments. £5m of the capital was provided by Beringea from funds provided by Proven and Proven Growth and Income VCTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.provenvcts.co.uk/news-media/pressreleasedetail/65/2014 |title=Beringea Invests £5 million in Electronic Specialist Maplin |work=ProVen |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10930541/Electronics-retailer-Maplin-sold-for-85m.html |title=Electronics retailer Maplin sold for £85m |date=27 June 2014 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Oliver Meakin was appointed as CEO, setting new strategy for the business of leveraging the growth in home automation and App based technology. In January 2018, Graham Harris was appointed new CEO replacing Oliver Meakin. It was reported in February 2018 that the company was seeking a buyer, and attempted to enter into a "pre pack" administration deal as part of a sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maplin in talks with potential buyers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43121649|accessdate=20 February 2018|publisher=BBC News|date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Horizon 2015==

===Horizon project (2013 to 2015)===

Chief Executive Officer John Cleland took post of Maplin on 1 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retail-week.com/sectors/electricals/john-cleland-named-maplin-chief-executive/5034167.article |title=John Cleland named Maplin chief executive |date=24 February 2012 |first=George |last=MacDonald |work=[[Retail Week]] |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Internal Memo"/&gt; Following this, he set out plans for the Horizon 2015 project, aiming to recover the historic decline in the business by 2015.

The Horizon 2015 project established some medium term goals, such as a complete overhaul of the existing stores, widening the product range, and establishing a clear message to the consumer. Its success in stopping the decline and stabilising profitability helps secure its acquisition by Rutland Partners in June 2014, investing in the next stage of the plan to 2020.

===Service guarantees===
Maplin introduced three service guarantees in an attempt to improve its customer service interface:-
* '''Price match''' – This is available for any product which is available online or in-store. Maplin will price match online prices, but that company must be based in the United Kingdom, and have a High Street store somewhere in the country. Maplin does not price match 'Online Only' stores such as Amazon, eBay, or Gumtree.
* '''365 day 'No Quibble{{'}}''' – Returns are handled primarily in stores instead of being sent away.
* '''Free delivery''' – No delivery charge when purchasing within the store.

===Store expansion===
[[File:Maplin Electronics - Perry Barr - before opening.jpg|thumb|A store at One Stop Shopping Centre, [[Perry Barr]], [[Birmingham]], a few days before the scheduled opening in 2013]]

In the company's effort to remain part of the retail industry, it had invested £40 million to overhaul its e-commerce platforms on its website and through smart phone apps, and to reach a medium term goal of 300 retail stores throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland before expanding abroad in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retail-week.com/knowledge-bank/analysis-maplin-plots-store-growth-as-part-of-renewal-strategy/5050678.article |title=Analysis: Maplin plots store growth as part of renewal strategy |date=5 July 2013 |first=Suzanne |last=Bearne |work=Retail Week |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was also looking to find vacant store outlets in key cities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maplin.co.uk/property |title=Maplin - The Electronics Specialist |work=Maplin |accessdate=6 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122092602/http://www.maplin.co.uk/property |archivedate=22 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which to expand.

In 2013, Maplin planned to open travel stores in airports and railway stations, where it would offer a tailored product selection, such as travel adaptors, batteries, and laptop chargers.&lt;ref name="retail-week.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maplin.co.uk/help-centre?helppageid=124 |title=Help Centre |work=Maplin |accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Product range===
Maplin sold a large selection of electrical and electronic equipment such as audio/visual devices, components, computer devices and peripherals, cables, television and satellite equipment, everyday electrical items such as batteries and light bulbs, [[Power supply|power adaptors]] and [[Photovoltaic module|solar energy panels]]. The company also sold [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], portable televisions and satellite navigation equipment.

The target market ranged from the general consumer to the more technical electronics hobbyist.

In November 2012, former Maplin CEO John Cleland stated, "We want to double the range of products we sell online from 15,000 to 30,000 [[stock keeping unit]]s (SKU) in the next three years, in some cases we will work on fulfilling orders by delivering straight from the manufacturer to the customer".&lt;ref name="retail-week.com" /&gt;

In November 2017, under the leadership of the new CEO Oliver Meakin, (appointed in September 2016) Maplin partnered with high street tech repair company, [[iSmash]], to add smartphone repair centres to three stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/11/21/ismash-ramps-expansion-plans-maplin-partnership/|title=iSmash ramps up expansion plans with Maplin partnership|last=Torrance|first=Jack|date=21 November 2017|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 April 2018|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==
Maplin announced on 28 February 2018 it had entered administration after failing to find a buyer for the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43223175 |title=Maplin collapses as rescue talks fail |date=28 February 2018 |work=BBC News |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] (PwC) were assigned to handle the affairs of Maplin Electronics effective from 28 February. On 10 March 2018 a video announcement was made to staff members via the internal social media platform "Fuse", informing them that PwC had failed to locate a buyer for some or all of the business and would begin the store closure programme, which was expected to take around 3 months to conclude.

On 10 March 2018, PwC brought in Insolvency and Closure Firm Hilco to manage the day to day affairs of the business, and to close the distribution centre, and both head offices at Brookfields, [[Rotherham]] and Churchill House, [[East London]] as well as making all staff redundant, some with as little as one day's notice.

On 30 April 2018, Maplin closed their website. On 12 May 2018 operations in the distribution centre at Brookfields were shut down after pushing all remaining stock reserves out to stores. By 25 June 2018, all official Maplin stores across the United Kingdom had closed their doors with the Maplin company ceasing to exist.

In September 2018, UK technology news site [[The Register]] reported that [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]] has brought the Maplin name and related IPs.&lt;ref name="theregister.co.uk"/&gt; The Maplin site has been since brought online and as of September 2018 is waiting for the official relaunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maplin.co.uk/|title=maplin {{!}} Connecting Brilliant Ideas|website=www.maplin.co.uk|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7229">On 19 May 1949, the Governor of [[Taiwan Province]], [[Chen Cheng]], and the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] (ROC) promulgated the "Order of Martial Law" to announce the imposition of '''Taiwan martial law''' ({{zh|c=臺灣省戒嚴令|p=Táiwān Shěng Jièyán Lìng}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Han Chueng|title=Taiwan in Time: The precursor to total control|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2016/05/15/2003646284|accessdate=15 May 2016|work=Taipei Times|date=15 May 2016|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the order was lifted by the President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] on 15 July 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration of the Lifting of Martial Law Starting 12AM on 15 July 1987|url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/detail.jsp?sysid=D8702956|website=National Central Library Gazette Online|accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwan had been under [[martial law]] for more than 38 years, which was qualified as "the longest imposition of martial law by a regime anywhere in the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulvenon|first=James C|title=A Poverty of riches: new challenges and opportunities in PLA research|year=2003|publisher=Rand Corporation|isbn=0-8330-3469-3|pages=172|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; at that time.

==History of martial law in the ROC==
The history of martial law of the ROC could be dated back to the final year of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The outline of a 1908 draft constitution—modeled on [[Japan]]'s [[Meiji Constitution]]—included provisions for martial law.{{sfnp|Mulvenon|2003|p=171}} The ROC government promulgated the Provisional Constitution in March 1911, which authorized the president to declare martial law in times of emergency. Then, a series of regulations related to martial law were issued by ROC in [[mainland China]] later in 1920s to 1940s. However, the factual legal basis for the martial law in effect between 1948 and 1987 promulgated by ROC was the "[[Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion]]" adopted by the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|ROC National assembly]] in April 1948. In December 1948, in the face of the mounting nationalists' defeats, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] announced the imposition of martial law throughout the country. However, remote areas such as [[Xinjiang]], [[Tibet]], [[Qinghai]], as well as [[Taiwan Province]] are not within the scope of the influence. On 20 May 1949, Taiwan Province was officially included under the influence of the martial law.

==Influence of martial law==

{{Main|White Terror (Taiwan)}}
After the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the ROC obtained control of Taiwan. In December 1949, the ROC government, led by President [[Chiang Kai-shek]], retreated from [[Nanjing]] to [[Taipei]], Taiwan's largest city. The ROC continued to claim sovereignty over all "[[China]]", which the ROC defines to include [[mainland China]], Taiwan, [[Outer Mongolia]] and other areas while the [[Communist]] [[People's Republic of China]] claimed to be the only China and that the ROC no longer existed. Thus, the two regimes entered a new era of confrontation and the martial law became one of the most important laws to "suppress Communist and Taiwan Independent activities in Taiwan", issuing the emergency declaration.

Also in the year 1949, a series of relevant regulations were promulgated by ROC government, including the ''Regulations to prevent unlawful assembly, association, procession, petition, strike under martial law'', the ''Measures to regulate newspapers, magazines and book publication under the martial law'' and the ''Regulations for the punishment of rebellions''.

Under the martial law, the formation of new political parties was prohibited except the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT), the [[Chinese Youth Party]] and the [[China Democratic Socialist Party]]. In order to implement the strict political censorship, the ''lianzuo'' or collective responsibility system was adopted among the civil servants from 9 July 1949 and soon spread to all the enterprises and institutions, according to which no one would be employed without a guarantor.

The government was authorized by the martial law to deny the right of assembly, free speech and publication in [[Taiwanese Hokkien]]. Newspapers were asked to run propaganda articles or make last-minute editorial changes to suit the government's needs. At the beginning of the martial law era,  "newspapers could not exceed six pages. The number was increased to eight pages in 1958, 10 in 1967 and 12 in 1974. There were only 31 newspapers, 15 of which were owned by either the KMT, the government or the military."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taiwanese Society Under Martial Law Remembered|url=http://www.chinatownconnection.com/taiwanese-society-martial-law.htm|accessdate=20 September 2011|date=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taiwan Garrison Command]] had sweeping powers, including the right to arrest anyone voicing criticism of government policy and to screen publications prior to distribution. According to a recent report by the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, around 140,000 Taiwanese were arrested, tortured, imprisoned or executed for their real or perceived opposition to the KMT and 3000–4000 people were executed during the martial law period. Since these people were mainly from the intellectual and social elite an entire generation of political and social leaders was decimated. It was not until 2008 that a public apology was made for those actions. No form of restitution or compensation has ever been made (as of 2010).

==Lifting of martial law==

Enforcement was relaxed after [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s death in 1975. The lifting of martial law was proclaimed by President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] on 14 July 1987 followed by the liberalization and democratization of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|date=15 July 1987|title=Taiwan Ends 4 Decades of Martial Law |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/15/world/taiwan-ends-4-decades-of-martial-law.html|accessdate=8 October 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) was illegally established in September 1986 and won 21.6 percent of the vote in December legislative elections that year.

Lifting of martial law permitted opposition political parties to be formed legally for the first time, giving Taiwan's fragmented but increasingly vocal opposition a new chance to organize. But even after the law was lifted, tight restrictions on freedom of assembly, speech and the press remained in place, having been written into a National Security Law, which had been passed a few days before the lifting of martial law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gluck|first=Caroline|date=13 July 2007 |title=Remembering Taiwan's martial law|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6294902.stm|accessdate=20 September 2011|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali bin Abi Talib]] took part in all the battles of Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s time, except the [[Battle of Tabuk]], as standard bearer. He also led parties of warriors on raids into enemy lands, and was an ambassador. Ali's fame grew with every battle that he was in, due to his courage, valour, and chivalry, as well as the fact that he single-handedly, destroyed many of Arabia's most famous and feared warriors. [[Muhammad]] acknowledged him as the greatest warrior of all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alm3refh.com/vb/t26624.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Battle of Badr==
{{further|Battle of Badr}}
[[File:Siyer-i Nebi - Imam Ali und Hamza bei dem vorgezogenen Einzelkampf in Badr gegen die Götzendiener.jpg|thumb|[[Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] and Ali lead the Muslim armies during the [[Battle of Badr]].]]

===Scouting===
Muhammad did not know that an army had left [[Mecca]], was marching toward [[Medina]] to protect the caravan of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]], and to challenge the Muslims. When Muhammad arrived in the environs of [[Badr, Saudi Arabia|Badr]], he sent Ali to reconnoiter the surrounding country. At the wells of Badr, Ali surprised some water-carriers. In reply to his questions, they told him that they were carrying water for an army which came from Makkah, and which was encamped on the other side of the nearby hills.

Ali brought the water-carriers before Muhammad. From them he learned that the caravan of the Quraysh had already escaped, and that the [[Muslim]]s, at that very moment, were confronted by the army of Mecca.

&lt;blockquote&gt;On reaching the neighbourhood of Badr, Muhammad sent forward Ali, with a few others, to reconnoiter the rising ground above the springs. There they surprised three water-carriers of the enemy, as they were about to fill their sheepskins. One escaped to the Quraysh; the other two were captured and taken to the Muslim  army. From them Muhammad discovered the proximity of his enemy. There were 950 men; more than threefold the number of the Moslem army. They were mounted on 700 camels and 100 horses, the horsemen all clad in mail. (Sir William Muir, ''The Life of Mohammed, London, 1877'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Battle===

Ali, along with his uncle Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib and cousin [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]], proceeded to single duels. Ali's duel was against [[Walid ibn Utba]], one of Mecca's fiercest warriors.

The youngest pair engaged first, Ali stepping forward to meet Walid. After a few moments of fencing, Waleed fell by the sword of his Muslim opponent. Then Hamza engaged Shaybah ibn Rab'iah and cut him down. Ubayda ibn Harith, the third Muslim champion, received a fatal wound from Utbah ibn Rab'iah. Ali and Hamza hastily dispatched Ut'bah ibn Rab'iah, carrying Ubaida to die in the Muslim lines.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Glubb, The Great Arab Conquests, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

By noon the battle was over. The Quraysh fled. Forty-nine of the enemy had fallen and Ali had killed twenty-two, either alone or with the help of others. An equal number was captured. The believers had lost fourteen men on the field of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Tor Andre, ''Mohammed, the Man and his Faith, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali first distinguished himself as a warrior in 624, at the [[Battle of Badr]]. He defeated the [[Umayyad]] champion [[Walid ibn Utba]] as well as many other Meccan soldiers. His art of battle was so brilliant that in the battle, there were 70 Polytheist (Mushrikeen), 35 of them (almost half of them) were killed by Ali.

He also said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Half of them were killed by me, and the other half were killed by the other companions of Prophet Muhammad with the help of angels who descended on Earth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

==The Battle of Uhud==
{{further|Battle of Uhud}}

One year after the battle of Badr, the new army of the idolaters of Mecca was ready to take the field against the Muslims. In March 625 AD, [[Abu Sufyan]] left Mecca at the head of three thousand seasoned warriors. Most of them were foot soldiers but they were supported by a strong contingent of cavalry. Also accompanying the army, was a band of warlike women. Their duty was to wage "psychological warfare" against the Muslims by reading poetry and by singing amatory songs to spur the courage and the will-to-fight of the soldiers. They knew that nothing held such terror for the [[Arabs]] as the jibes of women for cowardice, and they also knew that nothing was so efficacious to turn them into utterly reckless fighters as the promise of physical love. These amazons included the wives of Abu Sufyan and [[Amr bin Aas]], and the sister of [[Khalid bin Walid]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Killing the Pagans Standard Bearers===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Meccans, generously assisted by the women who had brought their timbrels, flung insults at the Muslims. These were alternated by Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan, who led triumphant choruses as she danced round the idol which perched on the camel.

Talha, the hereditary standard-bearer of the Koreishites, was the first Meccan challenger. As he stepped out of Abu Sufyan's ranks, Ali stepped out of Muhammad's. The two men met in the middle of 'no man's land.' Without words or preliminary flourishes the duel began. Talha never stood a chance. Ali's scimitar flashed in the morning sun and the head of the standard-bearer leaped from his shoulder and rolled away on the sand.

'Allahu Akbar!'([[Allah]] is the greatest) echoed from the eagerly watching Muslims. ([[R. V. C. Bodley]], ''The Messenger, the Life of Mohammed, New York, 1946'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; When Ali ibn Abu Talib killed the carrier of the Meccan flag, Talhah ibn Abu Talha, it was immediately raised again by Uthman ibn Abu Talha. And when Uthman fell at the hands of Hamzah, it was raised again by Abu Sa'd ibn Abu Talhah. At the moment he raised the Meccan flag he shouted at the Muslims. ''"Do you pretend that your martyrs are in paradise and ours in hell? By God, you lie! If anyone of you truly believes such a story, let him come forward and fight with me."'' His challenge attracted Ali who killed him on the spot. The Banu Abd al Dar kept on carrying the Meccan flag until they lost nine men.  (Muhammad Husayn Haykal, ''The Life of Muhammad'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ali alone had killed eight standard-bearers of the idolaters of Mecca.

[[Ibn Athir]], the Arab historian, writes in his ''Tarikh Kamil'' "''The man who killed the standard-bearers (of the pagans) was Ali.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali ibn al-Athir]], [[The Complete History]] (Al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh), vol 3 p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===The General Offensive===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ali ibn Abu Talib pressed on undismayed into the enemy ranks – it was Badr again; the Muslims were invincible.  (''Sir John Glubb, The Great Arab Conquests, 1963'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ali and [[Hamza]] had broken the ranks of the Quraysh, and he was already deep inside their lines. Unable to resist his attack, they began to yield ground. Between them, they were grinding back the army of Quraysh.

===The Flight of the Muslims===

The death of the bearers of the banner heightened the morale of the Muslims, who pursued the enemy headlong. This however resulted in complacency, with some of the Muslim soldiers beginning to claim war spoils for themselves whilst the battle had not yet been fully won. This allowed the pagans to launch a counter-attack, which dismayed the Muslim army and sent it into headlong retreat. Muhammad remained stranded, with only a few soldiers left to defend him against the attacks of Khalid ibn Waleed. It is recorded that 'Ali alone remained, fending off the assaults of Khaleed's cavalrymen. According to Ibn Atheer, ''"The Prophet became the object of the attack of various units of the army of Quraish from all sides. Ali attacked, in compliance with Muhammad's orders, every unit that made an attack upon him and dispersed them or killed some of them, and this thing took place a number of times in Uhud."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/ohod.asp|title=History of Islam and Muslims, The second battle of Islam at Uhud, Battle of Ohod|author=Akramulla Syed|work=ezsoftech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when somebody raised the cry that Muhammad was killed, chaos reigned supreme, Muslim morale plunged to the bottom and Muslimzsoldiers fought sporadically and purposelessly. This chaos was responsible for their killing of Husayl ibn Jabir Abu Hudhayfah by mistake, as everyone sought to save his own skin by taking flight except such men as Ali ibn Abu Talib whom God had guided and protected. (Muhammad Husayn Haykal, ''The Life of Muhammad, 1935, Cairo'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first of the Qurash to reach the Prophet's position was Ikrimah. As Ikrimah led a group of his men forward the Prophet turned to Ali and, pointing at the group, said, "Attack those men." Ali attacked and drove them back, killing one of them. Now another group of horsemen approached the position. Again the Prophet said to Ali, "Attack those men." 1 Ali drove them back and killed another infidel.
A regiment arrived from Kinanah in which four of the children of Sufyan Ibn Oweif were present. Khalid, Abu AI-Sha-atha, Abu Al-Hamra, and Ghurab. The Messenger of God said to Ali: "Take care of this regiment." Ali charged the regiment, and it was about fifty horsemen. He fought them while he was on foot until he scattered them. They gathered again and he charged them again. This was repeated several times until he killed the four children of Sufyan and added to them six more ... (Ibn Abu Al Hadeed, in his Commentary, vol 1 p 372)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was said that during 'Ali's defence of the Prophet, a call was heard, as follows: "There is no soldier but Ali, and there is no sword save Zhulfiqar."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Al Atheer, In his Biography, vol 2 p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Battle of the Trench==
{{further|Battle of the Trench}}
[[File:Combat between Ali ibn Abi Talib and Amr Ben Wad near Medina.JPG|thumb|A depicted painting of combat between Ali ibn Abi Talib (left) and Amr Ben Wad during [[Battle of the Trench]].]]

After the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan and the other pagan leaders realized that they had fought an indecisive action, and that their victory had not borne any fruits for them. Islam had, in fact, resiled from its reverse at Uhud, and within an astonishingly short time, had reestablished its authority in Medina and the surrounding areas. Again Ali proved to be an invincible warrior by killing Amr ibn wod al ameree who was one of the most feared warriors at the time. After Ali dropped Amr ibn wod al ameree off his horse, Amr spat at Ali. Ali got angry, and so he walked away for a moment and then got back after he calmed down, he told Amr ibn wod al ameree "If i killed you then i would have satisfied myself and not God's will" and then he killed Amr. The Muslim ranks roared and were happy. The Prophet said "Ali's strike on the day of the trench, is worth the combined worship of all of mankind and Jinns" {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==The Battle of Khaybar==
{{further|Battle of Khaybar}}

The campaign of Khaybar was one of the greatest. The masses of Jews living in Khaybar were the strongest, the richest, and the best equipped for war of all the peoples of Arabia. Even though they were rich and lived in castles Muhammed and Ali still had respect for them in Khaybar Imam Ali suffered from an eye illness and was not in battle-ready condition. Although he was ill, Prophet Muhammed called him and he came to his service. According to Islamic historians, Muhammed cured Ali's illness by rubbing his saliva on Ali's eyes. According to this tradition, Ali killed a Jewish chieftain with a sword-stroke, which split in two the helmet, the head and the body of the victim. Having lost his shield, Ali is said to have lifted both of the doors of the fortress from its hinges, climbed into the moat and held them up to make a bridge whereby the attackers gained access to the redoubt. This story is one basis for the Muslim view, especially in Shi'a Islam, of Ali as the prototype of heroes.

==The other expeditions==
Ali also participated in the [[Expedition of Fidak]]. Muhammad sent Ali to attack the Bani Sa‘d bin Bakr tribe, because Muhammad received intelligence they were planning to help the Jews of Khaybar&lt;ref&gt;Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 211. ([https://www.webcitation.org/60wanT9G2?url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s13.html online])&lt;/ref&gt;

He also led the [[Expedition of Ali ibn Abi Talib (Al-Fuls)|Expedition of Ali ibn Abi Talib]] as a commander in July 630.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abu Khalil|first=Shawqi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZmBkoDa9fcC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Atlas of the Prophet's biography: places, nations, landmarks|date=1 March 2004|publisher=Dar-us-Salam|isbn=978-9960897714|page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad sent him to aestroy al-Qullus, an idol worshipped by pagans&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar pp. 269-270"&gt;Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, pp. 269-270.

===Battle of the Camel===
[[File:Muhammad's widow, Aisha, battling the fourth caliph Ali in the Battle of the Camel.jpg|thumb|[[Aisha]] battling the fourth Rashidun Caliph Ali in the [[Battle of the Camel]].]]
{{main|Battle of the Camel}}

The [[Battle of the Camel]], sometimes called the Battle of Jamal or the Battle of Bassorah, took place at [[Basra]], [[Iraq]] on {{date|7 November 656}}.  [[A'isha]] heard about the killing of [[Uthman]] (644-656), the third [[Caliph]]. At the time she was on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. It was on this journey that she became so angered by his unavenged death, and the naming of [[Ali]] as the fourth caliph, that she took up arms against those supporting Ali. She gained support of the big city of Basra and, for the first time, Muslims took up arms against each other. This battle is now known as the [[First Fitna]], or Muslim civil war.&lt;ref name="Oxford Islamic Studies Online 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mernissi|first=Fatima|title=A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/book/islam-9780195116212/islam-9780195116212-chapter-13?_hi=0&amp;_pos=1#islam-9780195116212-bibItem-063-1|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Siffin===
{{main|Battle of Siffin}}
The Battle of Siffin ({{lang-ar|صفين}}; May–July 657 [[Common Era|CE]]) occurred during the [[First Fitna]], or first Muslim civil war, with the main engagement taking place from July 26 to July 28. It was fought between [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Muawiyah I]], on the banks of the [[Euphrates]] river, in what is now [[Raqqa]], [[Syria]].

The two armies encamped themselves at [[Siffin]] for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Neither side wanted to fight. Then on 11th Safar 37 AH, the Iraqis under Ashtar's command, the Qurra, in Ali's army, who had their own camp started the fighting in earnest which lasted three days.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, p.  22 from Ibn Hisham from Ibn Muzahim died 212 AH from Abu Mikhnaf died 170 AH&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Yaqubi wrote that Ali had 80,000 men, including 70 Companions who participated in the [[Battle of Badr]], 70 Companions who took oath at Hudaibia, and 400 prominent [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansars]] and [[Muhajirun]]; while Muawiya had 120,000 Syrians.&lt;ref&gt;Yaqubi, vol 2, p. 188.  ''Tarikh Al-Yaqubi (Tarikh Ibn Wadih)''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The battle of siffin was one of the bloodiest battles in the Islamic history, all of the bravest warriors of Arabia participated in the battle both from Iraq and Syria. the fighting usually began in the morning and continued till evening. at first Ali  didn't want a general war because he had all the hope of convincing Muawiya to put down his rebellion. The first 3 month's both camps where in full negotiations with each other, the fighting was very limited and each day a commander of Ali's army came out with a battalion and from the other side there was the same respond. After 3 months of negotiations Ali realised that its all in vain and prepared for a general war. the night before the battle the soldiers spent their night sharpening their swords, spears and arrows. By this announcement Muawiya became worried because he knew the bravery of Ali and his swordsmanship skills. Muawiya also did the same and prepared his troops for a bloody battle. Early in the morning Ali set his troops in formation, he gave the command of the left flank to his best general Malik al-ashtar who was renown for his bravery and fighting skills, over the right flank he gave the command to a courageous soldier named Abdullah ibn Abbas, Ali himself took position in the centre of the army. By the time both armies stood in front of each other, Ali gave the order for a full attack, the fight was so fierce that even the bravest warriors perished. by midday the right flank of Ali's army began to fall en the men began to flee, when Ali saw his right flank is falling he himself moved to the right flank and faced the onslaught of the enemy who were great in numbers, Ali drove the enemy back because of his great valor and fighting skills, he slaughtered every soldiers who came in his way, when the men saw their flank is reorganized by Ali himself they came back to the battlefield for a new attack. When Ali saw his right flank back in formation he returned to the centre and made an attack with the men from the centre and his personal bodyguard elite, The attack was so fierce that the whole Syrian army where pushed back. Ali himself fought with such a valor that even the great Syrian warriors got frightend of him when they heard that Ali is coming for an attack. the battle of that day was so fierce that it continued to the night. by the time Ali and his army had pushed the Syrians 500 meters back from the battleground and victory became in sight. it is said that every man Ali killed he called out " god is great " and when it was counted it came on 534 confirmed kills which is a record in history of war.

[[William Muir]] wrote that, "Both armies drawn out in entire array, fought till the shades of evening fell, neither having got the better. The following morning, the combat was renewed with great vigour. Ali posed himself in the centre with the flower of his troops from Medina, and the wings were formed, one of the warriors from Basra, the other of those from Kufa. Muawiya had a pavilion pitched on the field; and there, surrounded by five lines of his sworn body-guards, watched the day. Amr with a great weight of horse, bore down upon the Kufa wing which gave away; and Ali was exposed to imminent peril, both from thick showers of arrows and from close encounter ... Ali's general Ashtar, at the head of 300 Hafiz-e-Qur'an(those who had memorized the Koran) led forward the other wing, which fell with fury on Muawiya's body-guards. Four of its five ranks were cut to pieces, and Muawiya, bethinking himself of flight, had already called for his horse, when a martial couplet flashed in his mind, and he held his ground."&lt;ref name="The Caliphate, its Rise and Fall--p261"&gt;William Muir, ''The Caliphate, its Rise and Fall'' (London, 1924) page 261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Nahrawan===
{{main|Battle of Nahrawan}}
The Battle of Nahrawan ({{lang-ar-at|معركة النهروان|M'arkah an-Nahrawān}}) was a battle between [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] (the first [[The Twelve Imams|Shi'ah Imam]] and the fourth Sunni [[Caliph]]) and the [[Kharijites]], near [[Nahrawan]], twelve miles from Baghdad.

The '''Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD)''' is a body of [[European Union|European]] legislation for the regulation of first- and second charge[[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] and consumer buy-to-let (CBTL) lending.&lt;ref name="Implementing" /&gt; It was originally adopted by the [[European Commission]] on 4 February 2014 and Member states had to transpose the regulations in their national law by March 2016.

The [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] introduces a European framework of conduct standards for firms selling residential mortgages.

The objective of the Directive is to create a Union-wide mortgage credit market, with a high level of consumer protection.&lt;ref name="Implementing" /&gt;

==Overview==
The Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) lays down rules for [[creditors]], credit intermediaries and appointed sales representatives relating to the residential immovable market.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=European Commission|title=Directive 2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.|journal=Official Journal of the European Union|year=2014|volume=33|issue=60|pages=34–85|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0017&amp;from=EN|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCD applies to credit agreements that are secured by a residential mortgage and to credit agreements that have the purpose to acquire or retain property rights in land or in an existing or projected building.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=European Council of Real Estate Professions|title=A guide to Directive 2014/17/EU on Credit Agreements for Consumers Relating to Residential Immovable Property (the "Mortgage Credit Directive")|url=http://www.cepi-cei.eu/index.php?mact=Profile,cntnt01,downloadfile,0&amp;cntnt01returnid=400&amp;cntnt01uid=534ba41b04663&amp;cntnt01showtemplate=false&amp;hl=fr|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MCD was introduced by the [[European Union]] (EU) as implementation of the [[G-20 major economies|G20 commitment]] to establish principles on sound [[underwriting]] standards and to improve the conditions for the establishment of an [[internal market]] in the area of credit agreements relating to residential immovable property.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt; Furthermore, The Mortgage Credit Directive was designed as a preventive measure to avoid irresponsible lending and borrowing behaviour by market participants in the EU&lt;ref name="Implementing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Sharon|title=Implementing the Mortgage Credit Directive|url=https://www.wolterskluwerfs.com/article/implementing-the-mortgage-credit-directive.aspx|website=Wolters Kluwer|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to avoid a situation similar to what happened in the United States in 2006–2008, where a [[United States housing bubble|real estate bubble]] affected over half of the United States and left many American citizens either homeless or in huge debts.&lt;ref name="Thinking"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Case|first1=Karl E.|last2=Shiller|first2=Robert J.|last3=Thompson|first3=Anne K.|title=What Have They Been Thinking? Homebuyer Behavior in Hot and Cold Markets|journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|year=2012|issue=Fall|pages=265–315|doi=10.1353/eca.2012.0014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mortgage Credit Directive establishes common rules in the residential immovable market to better inform customers about the real costs of a [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]], to enable customers to better compare between competitors and to reflect on the mortgage contract before contract closure. It introduces measures to better protect mortgage customers from unfair and misleading practices.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt;

==Key aspects==
The Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) is a body of legislation that encompasses all mortgage lending to consumers. Credit agreements relating to residential immovable property for business purposes fall outside the scope of the legislation.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;

=== Documentation and Presale Disclosure Requirements ===

====European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS)====

The Regulation requires direct- and indirect mortgage sellers to provide the customer with a European Standardised Information Sheet (ESIS), in which the key features and risks of the mortgage contract are disclosed to the customer before contract closure.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt; In many countries there already exists a paper which discloses information with regards to the mortgage contract, but the ESIS extends and clarifies this information.&lt;ref name="LLP" /&gt; Included in the ESIS is a right of a seven-day reflection period, and information regarding the potential impact of interest rate changes.&lt;ref name="LLP" /&gt; Furthermore, the ESIS sets out an Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC) and provides example monthly payments in the case the interest rate rises to the highest level of the past 20 years.&lt;ref name="LLP" /&gt; The ESIS must be issued in good time before the conclusion of the credit agreement, to enable the customer to compare and reflect on the mortgage contract and enable the customer to ask for third party advise.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;

====Annual Percentage Rate of Charge (APRC)====

The Directive includes a formula that should be used to present the customer the Annual Percentage Rate of Charge. The APRC allows customers to oversee the overall costs of the mortgage contract and to better compare between different offers.&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt;

===Conduct and Procedural Requirements===

====Binding Offers====

Lenders are required to make a binding offer in relation to the mortgage contract. In the UK jurisdiction lenders were allowed to make conditional offers. This right remains preserved if a binding offer is made at a later stage of the process.&lt;ref name="LLP"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charles Russell Speechlys LLP|title=The implementation of the EU Mortgage Credit Directive|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=12c1a2ee-52cb-460a-a879-4f5a332881b5|publisher=Globe Business Media Group|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====7-day Reflection period====

The Directive sets out a requirement for borrowers to have the right of a seven-day reflection. The Directive leaves it to the Member States to decide whether this right should be granted in the pre-sale period, in the post-sale period or as a combination of the two.&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt;

====Tying and Bundling====

The Directive lays down specific rules for tying practises, which is the practise whereby a set of products or services has to be purchased together with the credit agreement. Combining credit agreements with other financial products or services is a mean for creditors to diversify and compete with other creditors. However, it may negatively affect customers’ mobility if the products can not be bought separately. Hence, the Directive helps to prevent tying practises that are not in the best interest of the customer, without constricting product bundling which can be beneficial to the mortgage customer.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LLP" /&gt;

====Property Valuations====

Member States should ensure that reliable valutation standards are in place to appropriately value immovable residential property before the conclusion of the credit agreement. These valuation standards should include internationally recognised valuation standards such as the standards developed by the International Valuation Standards Committee, the European Group of Valuers’ Associations or the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LLP" /&gt;

====Foreign Currency Mortgages====

The Directive proposes certain protection measures for credit agreements in a foreign currency due to the significant risks attached for the consumer. Hence, Member States must ensure that the customer has the right to convert the credit agreement to an alternative currency or that there are other arrangements in place that limit the risk the customer is exposed to in foreign currency loans.&lt;ref name="Implementing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LLP" /&gt;

====Knowledge and Competency====

The Mortgage Credit Directive provides harmonised rules as regards the fields of knowledge and competence that creditors, credit intermediaries and appointed representatives’ staff should possess in order to achieve a high level of professionalism. Member States should provide adequate monitoring to ensure that these knowledge- and competence requirements are applied. In addition, the Directive states that Member States should promote measures to support the education of mortgage customers in order to increase his or her ability to make an informed decision.&lt;ref name="Implementing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LLP" /&gt;

====Advertisement====

Member States should include or maintain disclosure requirements in their national law regarding the advertising of residential mortgages. These requirements ensure customer protection from unfair and misleading advertisements. Specific provisions regarding the advertisement of credit agreements should be given to enable customers to compare different offers and prevent them from a misleading impression of the product. Furthermore, the Directive states that advice given by mortgage providers should be in the best interest of the customer.&lt;ref name="Implementing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;

====Assessment of Customers’ Creditworthiness====

Member States should issue additional guidance on criteria and methods to assess a clients’ creditworthiness and they are encouraged to implement the Financial Stability Board's Principles for Sound Residential Mortgage Underwriting practises in this respective. It is deemed to be essential that the customers’ ability to refinance the credit agreement is assessed and verified before the conclusion of the credit agreement. The assessment should take into consideration all relevant factors that could impact a customers’ ability to repay the loan. Reasonable allowance should be made for future events that could negatively impact this ability. Furthermore, the possibility of an increase in residential immovable property value should not be taken as a sufficient condition for granting the credit.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;

====Early Repayment====

Member States should ensure that customers have a right to early repayment. A customers’ ability, to repay to mortgage prior to the expiry of the mortgage credit agreement, may play an important role in order for customers to compare different credit offers and enhances competition in the internal credit market. Furthermore, the right to early repayment promotes financial stability within the Union.&lt;ref name="Implementing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guide" /&gt;

==History==

In March 2003, the [[European Commission|Commission]] initiated a process to identify and assess the impact of barriers to the [[internal market]] for credit agreements relating to residential property. In December 2007, the [[European Commission|Commission]] adopted a White Paper on the Integration of EU Mortgage Credit Markets. They established an Expert Group on Credit History to prepare measures to improve credit data. In 2008, the [[Financial crisis of 2007-08|financial crisis]] revealed a series of problems existent in the residential mortgage market. These problems related to irresponsible borrowing and lending and to the potential scope for misbehavior by market participants. In March 2009, the [[European Commission|Commission]] has proposed measures in its Communication entitled ‘Driving European Recovery’ on 4 March, to deliver responsible markets for the future and restore consumer confidence in the residential immovable market. In March 2011, the [[European Commission]] adopted the proposal for a [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] on credit agreements relating to residential property. In February 2014, the Mortgage Credit Directive 2014/17/EU was adopted and the [[Directive (European Union)|Directive]] was implemented in the Member States by March 2016.&lt;ref name="Directive MCD" /&gt;

The '''National Library of Colombia''' ({{lang-es|Biblioteca Nacional de Colombia}}) is the [[national library]] of [[Colombia]]. The library is a dependency of the [[Ministry of Culture (Colombia)|Colombian Ministry of Culture]].

== Founding and history ==
The National Library of Colombia is generally considered to be the oldest national [[library]] in the [[Americas]]. It was founded at the end of the eighteenth century in 1777 by [[Viceroy]] Manuel De Guirior, who established the library in the city of [[Bogotá]]. The original collection of the library consisted of books [[Confiscation|expropriated]] from the [[Jesuit]] community, which had been expelled from all the dominions of the [[Spanish Empire]], as a result of the 1767 order of King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] of [[Spain]]. In 1825, due to the work of [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], the library was established at the campus of the [[Colegio de San Bartolomé]] and received its current name. On March 25, 1834, the first [[legal deposit]] [[law]] was decreed, which required that all copies of printed material in the country be sent to the library for storage. This law set the objective of the library, which then became the sole entity in charge of maintaining the bibliographic heritage of the [[nation]].

Bibliographic wealth of Colombia (incunabular, prints, sound recordings and audio-visual work of great historical and artistic value), located in the southeast corner of Independence Park. Founded January 9, 1777, inaugurated in 1938 and remodeled in 1978 by architect Jacques Mosseri, except decorative elements and façade design remained the same.

The two statues on both sides of calle 25 access, high relief at the attic, sign materials mixture and windows ornamentation were abolished. Four story building. In the first floor general reading rooms, kardex, exhibitions, music, classification, among other. In the second floor hemerotheca and researchers, in the third and fourth floors book storage and administrative offices.

Provides legal publications storage, official publications trade, guided visits, user card, photogram reproduction, works and photographs photocopying, and photograph or film works. As part of valuable donations received, Manuel del Socorro Rodríguez, [[Miguel Antonio Caro]], [[Rufino José Cuervo]], Eduardo Santos and Germán Arciniegas are the most important.

== Mission ==
[[File:Biblioteca nacional Bogotá.JPG|thumb|National Library of Colombia]]
The library's mission is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Garantizar la recuperación, preservación y acceso a la memoria colectiva del país, representada por el patrimonio bibliográfico y hemerográfico en cualquier soporte físico; así como la promoción y fomento de las bibliotecas públicas, la planeación y diseño de políticas relacionadas con la lectura, y la satisfacción de necesidades de información indispensables para el desarrollo individual y colectivo de los colombianos...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To guarantee the recovery of, preservation of, and access to the collective memory of the country, represented by the bibliographic and periodical heritage and in any form; so as to promote and foment [[public library|public libraries]], the planning and design of policies related to reading, and the satisfaction of the indispensable need for information for the individual and collective development of Colombians...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, according to a [http://www.nla.gov.au/initiatives/meetings/cdnl/colombia.pdf history of the library], the library also functions as a training center for librarians in Colombia as well as a source of books for other countries' libraries.

== Functions ==
According to a [[decree]] of the [[Senate of Colombia]], the library's stated functions are:
*To advise the [[Ministry of Culture]] as it concerns the formulation of policies on the bibliographic and periodical national heritage
*To guide the plans and programs about creation, promotion, and strengthening of public libraries and the complementary services that are rendered by them
*To direct and coordinate the national network of public libraries.
*To collect, organize, increase, conserve, preserve, protect, record, and spread the bibliographic and periodical heritage of the nation, sustained in different mediums of information.
*To plan and design policies related to reading and its contribution to the development of the education and intellect of the Colombian people
*To design, organize, and develop the bibliographic heritage to contribute to the strengthening of the national identity
*To establish and maintain relations with national and international organizations, with the goal of promoting and developing programs of popular culture and cultural exchange together, in the themes related to books and reading
*To provide advice to, and collaboration with, different scientific, cultural, and educational organizations that develop programs of investigation and cultural diffusion
&lt;!--*Fijar los derechos a cargo de los usuarios, cuando corresponda, por la utilización de sus servicios y bienes culturales, así como los derechos por documentos y publicaciones que emita.--&gt;

==Law of legal deposit==
[[File:Biblioteca Nacional.jpeg|thumb|The National Library from above]]
The law of legal deposit is regulated by Law 44 of 1993, the statutory Decree No. 460 of March 16, 1999, and the Decree 2150 of 1995. These laws and decrees are specifically about the National Library of Colombia. The creators of printed works, as well as audiovisual, audio, and video productions, should supply the library with a specified number of copies of the works, whether they were produced within the Colombian territory or imported.
*For printed works, two copies of each of the works produced within the national territory should be delivered to the National Library of Colombia; one copy to the ''[[Biblioteca del Congreso de la República de Colombia]]'' (Library of the Congress of the Republic of Colombia), and one copy to the Central Library of the ''[[Universidad Nacional de Colombia]]'' (National University of Colombia), excepting a few cases in which the high cost of the edition or the short duration of publication makes it possible to deliver fewer copies.
*For audiovisual and audio works, as well as for published works that have been imported, only one copy needs to be delivered to the National Library.

==Catalog==
Due to the legal deposit law and many charitable donations, the National Library has a large [[library catalog|catalog]] of publications. The collection contains 47 ''[[incunabula]]'', 610 volumes of [[manuscript]]s and other publications of "rare and curious" books, particularly purchased from or donated by personalities from the political and social life of Colombia, including the collections of [[Eduardo Santos]], [[German Arciniegas]],  [[Jorge Isaacs]],  [[Manuel Ancízar]],  [[Marco Fidel Suárez]], [[Miguel Antonio Caro]], and [[Rufino José Cuervo]] among others. The library also possesses publications of the [[United Nations]] Library, and pictorial works of historical value like the [[watercolor]]s of the [[Chorography]] Commission. A large quantity of audio recordings&lt;!--fonograma--&gt; comes from the legal deposit law, which has also allowed the library to possess a general collection of the majority of the publications made in the country since the year 1830 as well as a newspaper library with publications of priceless value, like the ''[[Aviso de Terremoto]]'', considered the premiere [[periodical publication]] in the Republic of Colombia.

The total collection of the Biblioteca Nacional de Colombia exceeds 2,000,000 volumes. Of this, approximately 25% was acquired through the beforementioned legal deposit laws. The other books have mostly come from donations.

The '''Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment''' (commonly known as the '''Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture''' ('''OPCAT''')) is a [[treaty]] that supplements to the 1984 [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]. It establishes an international inspection system for places of detention modeled on the system that has existed in Europe since 1987 (the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]]).

The OPCAT was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York on 18 December 2002,&lt;ref name=untc/&gt; and it entered into force on 22 June 2006.&lt;ref name=untc/&gt; As of January 2018, the Protocol has 75 signatories and 87 parties.&lt;ref name=untc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9-b&amp;chapter=4&amp;clang=_en |title=Parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea for this scheme of torture prevention goes back to the Swiss Committee for the Prevention of Torture (today [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]], APT), founded in 1977 by Jean-Jacques Gautier in [[Geneva]]. It envisaged the establishment of a worldwide system of inspection of places of detention, which later took the form of an Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984). For a long time, however, the necessary support for such an optional protocol was not forthcoming. As a consequence, the UN Committee Against Torture (CAT) had at its disposal only relatively weak instruments: it could analyse and discuss the self-reports of the respective governments and create the institution of a [[Special Rapporteur (UN)|Special Rapporteur]] on Torture. But neither CAT nor its Special Rapporteur had the power to visit countries, let alone inspect prisons, without the respective government's permission. In 1987, the [[Council of Europe]] realized the original idea on a regional level with its [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]]. On this basis, the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture|European Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] has demonstrated that regular visits, reports and recommendations to the governments as well as the publication of these reports and the governments' reactions the viability of this model. This in turn led to a breakthrough within the United Nations: OPCAT was created and opened for signatures on 18 December 2002 by the [[UN General Assembly]].

After ratification by 20 states, the Optional Protocol came into force on 22 June 2006.&lt;ref name=untc/&gt;

A '''period of [[financial distress]]''' occurs when the price of a company or an asset or an index of a set of assets in a market is declining with the danger of a sudden crash of value occurring, either because the company is experiencing increasing problems of cash flow or a deteriorating credit balance or because the price had become too high as a result of a speculative bubble that has now peaked.

==Background==
It is not known when this phrase was first used or by whom.  However, it or phrases closely equivalent were almost certainly first used in connection with the theory of [[value investing]] as developed initially by [[Benjamin Graham]] in his famous book  [[Security Analysis]] (Graham and Dodd, 1934).  This theory advocated long-term investing in stocks or assets that are underpriced compared to their [[Intrinsic value (finance)|intrinsic value]], that is they have suffered “distress sales” and the stock or asset of company is going through a “period of financial distress.”  If such a period is temporary, and the company can be expected to return to an improved condition of normal solvency, then investing in such an asset can be expected to outperform the stock market in general in the longer run.  In connection with this Graham developed the [[Benjamin Graham formula]], also known as “[[net current asset value]].”  A similar analysis was done by [[John Burr Williams]] who developed his [[discounted cash flow]] theory (Williams, 1938).  A prominent advocate of Graham and his approach has been [[Warren Buffett]], who has claimed that he is an “85% Graham investor” (Buffett, 2003).

This approach has been criticized by advocates of [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) and the closely related doctrine of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]] (EMH) most closely associated with [[Eugene Fama]] (Fama, 1970).  These theories argue that if a stock or asset is selling at what appears to be a “distress value” compared to some estimate of its true value based on its current income flows, then the market has information about the expected future of the company or asset that is not reflected in its current income flow.  In this regard, investors such as Buffett who have successfully used the Graham approach should expect to spend extra resources to have better information about the companies or assets they purchase compared to most agents in the market.  A study that shows that the Graham approach may well do better than various other alternatives (such as the “three-factor theory” that Fama and French, 1996, have argued performs better than the EMH), is Xiao and Arnold (2008).

==Use in forecasting corporate bankruptcies==
Another use of this phrase has been in connection with efforts to predict corporate bankruptcies that may come out of such a period of financial distress.  One who developed an approach to making such predictions has been [[Edward Altman]], who developed the [[z-score]] financial analysis tool (Altman, 1968).  Further study of this and related tools has been done by Altman and Hotchkiss (2005).  This idea can be related to the earlier issue in that presumably why the Graham approach might not do as well as such alternatives as MPT or EMH is that it does not satisfactorily account for the risk of such bankruptcies.  Again, it is clear that to outperform such models a Graham-style investor will have to have sufficiently good information about such possibilities to know whether or not such a threat can be discounted.

==Use in analysis of speculative bubbles and crashes==
Drawing on these uses from [[corporate finance]], [[Hyman Minsky]] applied the phrase to analyzing speculative bubbles and crashes (Minsky, 1972), using it to characterize a period in a speculative bubble that follows a peak in price, in which the price gradually declines, and which is then followed by a crash in which the price falls precipitously.  This analysis was adopted by [[Charles P. Kindleberger]], who in Appendix B of the 4th edition of his book, ''Manias, Panics, and Crashes'' (2000) identified 37 out of 47 historical bubbles as exhibiting such a pattern, including most of the more famous ones. Although the phrase was not used, participants in periods of financial distress in early bubbles used a variety of colorful terms and phrases for them, such as "apprehension" or "an ugly drop in the market" during the South Sea bubble in Britain in 1720 (Carswell, 1960, p. 139). Arguably the recent global bubble in financial derivatives exhibited this pattern, with a peak in August 2007, followed by a crash in September 2008.
The first to develop a mathematical model of this period of financial distress was [[J. Barkley Rosser, Jr.]] (Chapter 5, 1991), drawing on catastrophe theory, while a more detailed such model using [[agent-based modeling]] and relying on the wealth constraint idea due to Minsky has been done by Gallegati, Palestrini, and Rosser (2011.)

'''Pieter Wilhelm Adrianus Cort van der Linden''' (14 May 1846 – 15 July 1935) was a Dutch statesman who served as [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands]] from 29 August 1913 to 9 September 1918.

He was the last Prime Minister to lead a [[Economic liberalism|liberal]] cabinet and the last liberal to be Prime Minister until [[Mark Rutte]] in 2010 (92 years later). However, the [[First Rutte cabinet]] only held a minority in the House of Representatives. One of Cort van der Linden's major achievements was maintaining Dutch [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] during [[World War I]], although personally he was [[German Empire|pro-German]].

He also introduced [[universal suffrage]] in the Netherlands in what is nowadays known as the [[Pacification of 1917]]. Because of this, the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] and the [[General League of Roman Catholic Caucuses]] won the 1918 elections. The Catholic [[Charles Ruijs de Beerenbrouck]] took Cort van der Linden's place as Prime Minister.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47807">'''Psychological trauma''' is a type of damage to the [[mind]] that occurs as a result of a distressing event. Trauma is often the result of an overwhelming amount of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that exceeds one's ability to cope, or integrate the [[emotion]]s involved with that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|title=Trauma Definition|work=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805161505/http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may result from a single distressing experience or recurring events of being overwhelmed that can be precipitated in weeks, years, or even decades as the person struggles to cope with the immediate circumstances, eventually leading to serious, long-term negative consequences.

Because trauma differs between individuals, according to their subjective experiences, people will react to similar traumatic events differently. In other words, not all people who experience a potentially traumatic event will actually become psychologically traumatized. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Storr CL, Ialongo NS, Anthony JC, Breslau N|year=2007|title=Childhood antecedents of exposure to traumatic events and post-traumatic stress disorder|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=164|issue=1|pages=119–25|pmid=17202553|doi=10.1176/ajp.2007.164.1.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for some people to develop [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] ([[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]) after being exposed to a major traumatic event.&lt;ref name=":01"&gt;"Among individuals who do develop post-traumatic stress after exposure to a traumatic event, some develop symptoms sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD"

==Definition==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)]] defines trauma as direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, or injury experienced by a family member or close associate. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the [[in vivo]] environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|title=DSM-IV-TR – DSM Library|publisher=|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person's core assumptions about the world and their [[human rights]], putting the person in a state of extreme [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depended upon for survival violate, humiliate, [[Betrayal Trauma|betray]], or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like positive self worth, safe boundaries and personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DePrince, A.P.|author2=Freyd, J.J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|chapter=The Harm of Trauma: Pathological fear, shattered assumptions, or betrayal?|editor=J.

Psychologically traumatic experiences often involve [[physical trauma]] that threatens one's survival and sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional and Psychological Trauma|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|work=Helpguide.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913234027/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|archivedate=September 13, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include [[harassment]], [[embarrassment]], abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, [[sexual abuse]], partner battery, [[employment discrimination]], [[police brutality]], [[corruption#Judicial corruption|judicial corruption]] and [[Judicial misconduct|misconduct]], [[bullying]], [[paternalism]], [[domestic violence]], [[indoctrination]], being the victim of an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in [[childhood]]), life-threatening [[medical condition]]s, and medication-induced trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Charles|title=Psychiatric drugs as agents of Trauma|journal=The International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine|year=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=195–207|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128181725/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 January 2013|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic [[natural disaster]]s such as [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s, large scale transportation accidents, [[Structure fire|house or domestic fire]], [[motor vehicle accident]], mass interpersonal violence like [[war]], [[terrorist attack]]s or other mass victimization like [[sex trafficking]], being taken as a hostage or being [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme [[poverty]] or other forms of [[abuse]], such as [[verbal abuse]], exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.

Parts of the brain in a growing child are developing in a sequential and hierarchical order, from least complex to most complex. The brain's neurons are designed to change in response to the constant external signals and stimulation, receiving and storing new information. This allows the brain to continually respond to its surroundings and promote survival. Our five main sensory signals contribute to the developing brain structure and its function.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perry (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Infants and children begin to create internal representations of their external environment, and in particular, key attachment relationships, shortly after birth. Violent and victimizing attachment figures impact infants' and young children's internal representations.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A, Robinson JL|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author3link=Susan Coates|year=2007|title=Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children's mental representations of self and others|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=9|issue=3|pages=187–205|doi=10.1080/14616730701453762|pmid=18007959|pmc=2078523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more frequent a specific pattern of brain neurons is activated, the more permanent the internal representation associated with the pattern becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Krenawi; Graham; Kanat-Maymon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This causes sensitization in the brain towards the specific neural network. Because of this sensitization, the neural pattern can be activated by decreasingly less external stimuli. 
Childhood abuse tends to have the most complications with long-term effects out of all forms of trauma because it occurs during the most sensitive and critical stages of psychological development.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"/&gt; It could also lead to violent behavior, possibly as extreme as serial murder. For example, Hickey's Trauma-Control Model suggests that "[[Childhood trauma|childhood trauma]] for serial murderers may serve as a triggering mechanism resulting in an individual's inability to cope with the stress of certain events."&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, E. W. (2010). ''Serial Murderers and Their Victims.'' Blemont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often psychodynamic aspects of trauma are overlooked even by health professionals: "If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Psychological Trauma on Children and Adolescents|url=http://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/sites/dmh/files/report/cafu/DMH-CAFU_Psychological_Trauma_Moroz.pdf|format=PDF|date=June 30, 2005|author=Moroz, Kathleen J.|publisher=Vermont Agency of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
People who go through these types of extremely traumatic experiences often have certain symptoms and problems afterward. The severity of these symptoms depends on the person, the type of trauma involved, and the emotional support they receive from others.  The range of reactions to and symptoms of trauma can be wide and varied, and differ in severity from person to person. A traumatized individual may experience one or several of them.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

After a traumatic experience, a person may '''re-experience''' the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called [[Trauma trigger|triggers]], can be uncomfortable and even painful. Re-experiencing can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, as well as their ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events are recurring. Flashbacks can range from distraction to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing of symptoms is a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.

Triggers and cues act as reminders of the trauma and can cause [[anxiety]] and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive behaviors or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being fully aware of the nature or causes of their own actions. [[Panic attack]]s are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.

Consequently, intense feelings of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may always seem to be present due to re-experiencing past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]]s may haunt the person, and [[nightmare]]s may be frequent.&lt;ref name="Loyola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|title=Loyola College in Maryland: Trauma and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028034430/http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|archivedate=2005-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions, but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generation, thus making genetics one of the components of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frommberger|first=Ulrich|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person may not remember what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see [[Repressed memory|Repressed Memory]]). This can lead to the traumatic events being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like [[acute stress disorder|acute stress]] and anxiety disorder, [[traumatic grief]], [[undifferentiated somatoform disorder]], [[conversion disorder]]s, [[brief psychotic disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], adjustment disorder, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rothschild B|title=The body remembers: the psychophysiology of trauma and trauma treatment |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-70327-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, emotional exhaustion may set in, leading to distraction, and clear thinking may be difficult or impossible. [[Emotional detachment]], as well as [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] or "numbing out" can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.

Some traumatized people may feel permanently damaged when trauma symptoms do not go away and they do not believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation,  loss of [[self-esteem]], profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. If important aspects of the person's self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/facts/general/fs_effects.html |title=Effects of Traumatic Experiences: A National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet |accessdate=2005-12-09 |last=Carlson |first=Eve B. |author2=Josef Ruzek  |publisher=National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder |doi= |archiveurl=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/factsheets/effects |archivedate=2004-06-12 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear in the wake of the child's traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Coates SW, Kaminer T, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Schonfield IS, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Myers MM|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author2link=Susan Coates|year=2008|title=Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers|journal=Journal of Trauma and Dissociation|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–149|doi=10.1080/15299730802045666|pmid=18985165|pmc=2577290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances, seeking counselling in appropriate mental health services is in the best interests of both the child and the parent(s).
==Cause==

===Situational trauma===
Trauma can be caused by man-made, technological disasters and natural disasters,&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"&gt;Neria, Y., Nandi, A., &amp; Galea, S. (2008). Post-traumatic stress disorder following disasters: a systematic review. Psychological medicine, 38(4), 467–480. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; including war, abuse, violence, mechanized accidents (car, train, or plane crashes, etc.) or medical emergencies.

Responses to psychological trauma:
Response to psychological trauma can be varied based on the type of trauma, as well as socio demographic and background factors.&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"/&gt;
There are several behavioral responses common towards stressors including the proactive, reactive, and passive responses. Proactive responses include attempts to address and correct a stressor before it has a noticeable effect on lifestyle.  Reactive responses occur after the stress and possible trauma has occurred and are aimed more at correcting or minimizing the damage of a stressful event.  A passive response is often characterized by an emotional numbness or ignorance of a stressor.

Those who are able to be proactive can often overcome stressors and are more likely to be able to cope well with unexpected situations.  On the other hand, those who are more reactive will often experience more noticeable effects from an unexpected stressor. In the case of those who are passive, victims of a stressful event are more likely to suffer from long-term traumatic effects and often enact no intentional coping actions. These observations may suggest that the level of trauma associated with a victim is related to such independent coping abilities.

There is also a distinction between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma which may have been buried in the unconscious from past situations such as [[childhood abuse]]. Trauma is sometimes overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin of the trauma under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]].

===In psychoanalysis===
{{main article|Psychoanalysis}}

French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] argued in the 1890s that psychological trauma was the origin of all instances of the mental illness known as [[hysteria]].  Charcot's "traumatic hysteria" often manifested as a paralysis that followed a physical trauma, typically years later after what Charcot described as a period of "incubation".
[[Sigmund Freud]], Charcot's student and the father of [[psychoanalysis]], examined the concept of psychological trauma throughout his career.  [[Jean Laplanche]] has given a general description of Freud's understanding of trauma, which varied significantly over the course of Freud's career: "An event in the subject's life, defined by its intensity, by the subject's incapacity to respond adequately to it and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about in the psychical organization".&lt;ref name = Laplanche&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laplanche, J.  |author2=Pontalis, J.B. | year=1967 | title=The Language of Psycho-Analysis | publisher=W. W. Norton and Company | isbn=978-0-393-01105-0  | pages=465–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] claimed that what he called "[[The Real]]" had a traumatic quality external to symbolization. As an object of anxiety, Lacan maintained that The Real is "the essential object which isn't an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety ''par excellence''".&lt;ref name="seminar_II"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954–1955'' | p.164 (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1991), {{ISBN|978-0-393-30709-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress disorders===
{{main article|Posttraumatic stress disorder|Complex post-traumatic stress disorder}}
All psychological traumas originate from stress, a physiological response to an unpleasant stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|title=Physiology of Psychology|author=Carlson, Neil|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossarth-Maticek, R., Eysenck, H.J., &amp; Boyle, G.J. (1994). An empirical study of the diathesis-stress theory of disease. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 1'', 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term stress increases the risk of poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids for a long period of time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seyle, H.|title=The Stress of Life|journal=McGraw Hill|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one's susceptibility to stress disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunson|title=Mechanisms of late-onset cognitive decline after early-life stress|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or [[combat stress reaction]]. Psychological trauma may cause an [[acute stress reaction]] which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the [[Vietnam War]] in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances. The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least a month for diagnosis. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. continuous scanning of the environment for danger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frommberger, Ulrich|year=2014|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|volume=111|issue=5|pages=59–65|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2014.0059|pmid=24612528|pmc=3952004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives, but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"/&gt; Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.

The term ''continuous post traumatic stress disorder'' (CTSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straker|first=Gillian|title=The continuous traumatic stress syndrome: The single therapeutic interview|journal=Psychology and Society|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.

As one of the processes of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after a critical incident has not been shown to reduce incidence of PTSD, coming alongside people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNally RJ |author2=Bryant RA |author3=Ehlers A | title=Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? | journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume=4 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=45–79| doi = 10.1111/1529-1006.01421|pmid=26151755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vicarious===
Vicarious trauma affects workers who witnesses their clients' trauma. It is more likely to occur in situations where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and seeing oneself in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2008/phac-aspc/H72-21-178-2000E.pdf|title=Guidebook on Vicarious Trauma: Recommended Solutions for Anti-Violence Workers|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may also result if workers witness situations that happen in the course of their work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dr-john-bradford-won-t-work-magnotta-case-because-of-ptsd-1.2571463|title=Russell Williams profiler won't work Magnotta case because of PTSD|publisher=CBC|date= March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of help seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.

==Assessment==

As "trauma" adopted a more widely defined scope, traumatology as a field developed a more interdisciplinary approach. This is in part due to the field's diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. However, novel fields require novel methodologies. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.

The experience and outcomes of psychological trauma can be assessed in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Briere, John |author2=Scott, Catherine |title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=California |year=2006 |pages=37–63 |isbn=978-0-7619-2921-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk of imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's [[social support]] network are much more critical.

Understanding and accepting the psychological state an individual is in is paramount. There are many misconceptions of what it means for a traumatized individual to be in psychological crisis. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and incapable of self-comfort. If treated humanely and respectfully the individual is less likely to resort to self harm. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and to communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance, the individual will be taken seriously rather than being treated as delusional. It is vital for the assessor to understand that what is going on in the traumatized person's head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., post-traumatic symptoms, dissociation, [[substance abuse]], somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established [[rapport]] and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.

During assessment, individuals may exhibit activation responses in which reminders of the traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., [[distress (medicine)|distress]], anxiety, [[anger]]), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because individuals may not yet be capable of managing this distress, it is necessary to determine how the event can be discussed in such a way that will not "retraumatize" the individual. It is also important to take note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible post traumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).

In addition to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense [[depressive episode]]s, or [[self-mutilation]]. The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.

Though assessment of psychological trauma may be conducted in an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve the use of a structured interview. Such interviews might include the [[Clinician Administered PTSD Scale|Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale]] (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, &amp; Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for post-traumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).

Lastly, assessment of psychological trauma might include the use of self-administered psychological tests. Individual scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might include the use of generic tests (e.g., [[MMPI-2]], [[MCMI-III]], SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess post-traumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), Detailed Assessment of post-traumatic Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).

Children are assessed through activities and therapeutic relationship, some of the activities are play genogram, sand worlds, coloring feelings, Self and Kinetic family drawing, symbol work, dramatic-puppet play, story telling, Briere's TSCC, etc.&lt;ref name="GilATC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliana Gil|title=Helping Abused and Traumatized Children: Integrating Directive and Nondirective Approaches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe-E0CYLDqcC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60918-474-2|pages=28, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of psychotherapy approaches have been designed with the treatment of trauma in mind—[[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], [[progressive counting (PC)]], [[somatic experiencing]], [[biofeedback]], [[Internal Family Systems Model|Internal Family Systems Therapy]], and [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]].

There is a large body of empirical support for the use of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=_WhatIsCBTpublic|title=What is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)?|publisher=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schnurr-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schnurr | first1 = PP. | last2 = Friedman | first2 = MJ. | last3 = Engel | first3 = CC. | last4 = Foa | first4 = EB. | last5 = Shea | first5 = MT. | last6 = Chow | first6 = BK. | last7 = Resick | first7 = PA. | last8 = Thurston | first8 = V. | last9 = Orsillo | first9 = SM. | last10 = Haug | first10 = Rodney | last11 = Turner | first11 = Carole | last12 = Bernardy | first12 = Nancy | title = Cognitive behavioral therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in women: a randomized controlled trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 297 | issue = 8 | pages = 820–30 |date=Feb 2007 | doi = 10.1001/jama.297.8.820 | pmid = 17327524 | display-authors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  for the treatment of trauma-related symptoms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abct.org/Information/?m=mInformation&amp;fa=fs_TRAUMA|title=ABCT Fact Sheets: Trauma|publisher=Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].

Studies funded by pharmaceuticals have also shown that medications such as the new anti-depressants are effective when used in combination with other psychological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase-oriented treatment of structural dissociation in complex traumatization: overcoming trauma-related phobias|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=11–53|vauthors=Steele K, van der Hart O, Nijenhuis ER|pmid=16172081|doi=10.1300/J229v06n03_02|citeseerx=10.1.1.130.8227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma therapy allows processing trauma-related memories and allows growth towards more adaptive psychological functioning. It helps to develop positive coping instead of negative coping and allows the individual to integrate upsetting-distressing material (thoughts, feelings and memories) and to resolve these internally. It also aids in growth of personal skills like resilience, ego regulation, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFMXBAAAQBAJ|title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment (DSM-5 Update)|first1=John N.|last1=Briere|first2=Catherine|last2=Scott|date=25 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483351254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes involved in trauma therapy are:

* Psychoeducation: Information dissemination and educating in vulnerabilities and adoptable coping mechanisms.
* Emotional regulation: Identifying, countering discriminating, grounding thoughts and emotions from internal construction to an external representation.
* Cognitive processing: Transforming negative perceptions and beliefs about self, others and environment to positive ones through cognitive reconsideration or re-framing.
* Trauma processing: Systematic desensitization, response activation and counter-conditioning, titrated extinction of emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (in theory, to a state in which triggers no longer produce harmful distress and the individual is able to express relief.)
* Emotional processing: Reconstructing perceptions, beliefs and erroneous expectations, habituating new life contexts for auto-activated trauma-related fears, and providing crisis cards with coded emotions and appropriate cognitions. (This stage is only initiated in pre-termination phase from clinical assessment and judgement of the mental health professional.)
* [[Gestalt therapy|Experiential]] processing: Visualization of achieved relief state and relaxation methods.

A number of complementary approaches to trauma treatment have been implicated as well, including yoga and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Basant|last2=Kluewer D’Amico|first2=Jessica|last3=Makani|first3=Ramkrishna|last4=Parikh|first4=Tapan|date=2015-07-10|title=Nonconventional interventions for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder: Ketamine, repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and alternative approaches|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|issn=1529-9732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trauma-sensitive yoga]] has been specifically developed for the purposes of use with traumatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=D.|last2=Sharma|first2=R.|last3=Chaudhry|first3=S.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|date=2009|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga: principles, practice, and research|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga Therapy|volume=19|pages=123-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''registered trademark symbol''' ('''®''') is a [[symbol]] that provides notice that the preceding word or symbol is a [[trademark]] or [[service mark]] that has been registered with a national trademark office.  A trademark is a symbol, word, or words legally registered or established by use as representing a company or product.&lt;ref name="ukipo"&gt;[http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-manage/t-enforce.htm UK IPO, one example of a national trademark office]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sec 29"&gt;{{cite web|title=15 U.S.C. 1111|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1111|accessdate=15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries it is against the law to use the registered trademark symbol for a mark that is not officially registered in any country.&lt;ref name="ukipo" /&gt;

Trademarks not officially registered can instead be marked with the [[trademark symbol]] ™, while unregistered service marks are marked with the [[service mark symbol]] ℠. The proper manner to display these symbols is immediately following the mark, and is commonly in [[superscript]] style but is not legally required.

The registered trademark symbol was originally introduced in the [[Lanham Act|Trademark Act of 1946]].&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/r The Online Etymology Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer usage==
[[Image:RegisteredTM.svg|100px|left|thumb|The registered trademark symbol.]]
The registered trademark character has a [[standardized]] representation in most computer systems. It is mapped in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|00AE|Registered sign|html=}}.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0080.pdf|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 9.0, C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement|last=|first=|publisher=Unicode Consortium|year=2016|isbn=978-1-936213-13-9|location=Mountain View, CA|pages=0080–00FF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registered trademark symbol ® is distinct, in computer representation, from the similar character {{unichar|24C7|Circled Latin capital letter R|nlink=enclosed R|note=enclosed R}}

Because the ® symbol is not commonly available on [[typewriter]]s and [[ASCII]]-based computer systems, it is common to approximate it with the characters '''(R)''' (or '''(r)'''); for example, the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] Trademark Usage Policy advocates this usage.&lt;ref&gt;PSF Trademark Usage Policy. https://www.python.org/psf/trademarks/ "The first or most prominent mention of a Python trademark should be immediately followed by a symbol for registered trademark: "®" or "(r)"."&lt;/ref&gt;  Example of legal equivalents are the phrase ''Registered, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office'', which may be abbreviated to ''Reg U.S. Pat &amp; TM Off.'',&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Guillot. A Guide to Proper Trademark Use. 1995–2007. http://www.ggmark.com/guide.html&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S.,&lt;ref name="Sec 29" /&gt; and the letters ''RTM'' in the UK.&lt;ref name="ukipo" /&gt;

'''Regulatory law''' refers to law promulgated by an executive branch agency under a delegation from a legislature. Discussed at [[Regulation (law)]] and [[Primary and secondary legislation]]. Regulatory law contrasts to [[statutory law]] promulgated by the legislative branch, and [[common law]] or [[case law]] promulgated by the judicial branch.

The law that governs conduct of administrative agencies (both promulgation of regulations, and adjudication of applications or disputes), and judicial review of agency decisions, is called [[Administrative law]]. Administrative law is promulgated by the legislature (and refined by judicial common law) for ''governing'' agencies.

The administrative agencies are to create procedures, applications, licences, appeals and one other important thing called decision making. Administrative Procedure Act is responsible for all the Federal agency policies. Some states have started following the policies through law or by regulation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2229">'''Residenzpflicht''' (German for ''mandatory residence'') is a legal requirement affecting foreigners living in [[Germany]], more specifically applicants for [[refugee status]] (''Asylbewerber'') or those who have been given a temporary stay of [[deportation]] (''Geduldete''). Those affected are required to live within certain boundaries defined by the applicants' local foreigners' office (''Ausländerbehörde'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sich frei bewegen oder verreisen? |url=http://www.proasyl.de/de/themen/basics/basiswissen/rechte-der-fluechtlinge/bewegungsfreiheit/|work=[[Pro Asyl]] |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal basis ==

Applications for refugee status are required at all times to reside in the district of their local foreigner's office (§56 and §85 of the German Refugee Processing Law - the ''Asylverfahrensgesetz''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asylverfahrengsgesetz|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/asylvfg_1992/|work=AVerG|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Foreigners with a stay of deportation are generally required to stay within the boundaries of their [[States of Germany|federal state]] (ranging from small city-states such as [[Bremen]] to larger states such as [[Bavaria]]) and are regulated by §61 and §95 of the German Residence Act (''Aufenthaltsgesetz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aufenthaltsgesetz|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/aufenthg_2004/|work=AufG|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;'')

Foreigner who contravene the relevant legislation mentioned above can be imprisoned or face fines.

== Political context ==

The ''Residenzpflicht'' is unique to Germany. A 2007 complaint to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] was not accepted for judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ECHR Decision|url=http://www.coe.int/t/d/menschenrechtsgerichtshof/dokumente_auf_deutsch/volltext/entscheidungen/20071120-SEO.asp#OfPage|work=ECHR Decision|accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several immigrant and refugee advocacy organisations oppose the ''Residenzpflicht'' as a violation of fundamental human rights&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residenzpflicht|url=http://www.residenzpflicht.info/|work=Residenzpflicht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Operation Provide Relief.Rules of Engagement.jpg|thumb|Rules of Engagement for [[Operation Provide Relief]], 1992]]

'''Rules of engagement''' ('''ROE''') are the internal rules or directives among [[military forces]] (including individuals) that define the circumstances, conditions, degree, and manner in which the [[use of force]], or actions which might be construed as provocative, may be applied.&lt;ref&gt;NATO MC 362/1&lt;/ref&gt; They provide authorization for and/or limits on, among other things, the use of force and the employment of certain specific capabilities. In some [[nation]]s, ROE has the status of guidance to military forces, while in other nations, ROE is lawful commands. Rules of engagement do not normally dictate how a result is to be achieved, but will indicate what measures may be unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Drew, McLaughlin, Mandsager, San Remo Rules of Engagement Handbook (San Remo: International Institute for Humanitarian Law, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

While ROE is used in both domestic and international operations by some militaries, ROE is not used for domestic operations in the [[United States]]. Instead, the use of force by the [[U.S. military]] in such situations is governed by Rules for the Use of Force (RUF).

An abbreviated description of the rules of engagement may be issued to all personnel. Commonly referred to as a "ROE card", this document provides the [[soldier]] with a summary of the ROE regulating the use of force for a particular mission.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Drew, McLaughlin, Mandsager, San Remo Rules of Engagement Handbook (San Remo: International Institute for Humanitarian Law, 2009)p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritative sources==
While many countries have their own rules of engagement documents, many others do not. There are two primary international rules of engagement manuals that are internationally available: [[NATO]] ''ROE Manual MC 362-1'' (restricted to NATO and [[Partnership for Peace]] countries); and the ''San Remo Rules of Engagement Handbook'', which is freely available to all on the International Institute of Humanitarian Law (IIHL) website. Created for the [[International Institute of Humanitarian Law|IIHL]] by Commander Alan Cole, Major Phillip Drew, Captain Rob McLaughlin and Professor Dennis Mandsager, the ''San Remo ROE Handbook'' has been translated from its [[English language|English]] original into [[French language|French]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Arabic]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] and several other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iihl.org/sanremo-handbook-on-roe iihl.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries have used the San Remo handbook as a model for creating their own ROE systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Training==
The [[International Institute of Humanitarian Law]] in San Remo, Italy conducts rules of engagement training course at least once per year, usually in September. Taught by some of the world's foremost authorities on ROE, the course attracts students from around the globe. Similar training by the San Remo ROE drafting team is conducted for the [[United Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ask.un.org/faq/14531|title=How are Rules of Engagement (ROE) prepared for United Nations peacekeeping missions?|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; staff colleges and other organizations as requested.

== Violations ==
All rules of engagement created for use in armed conflict and in the ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' must comply with international law, as well as the domestic law of the state(s) using them. Any ROE that purport to permit violations of applicable law are void ''[[ab initio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;San remo Handbook p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, any ROE that would permit the torture of a person would be unlawful. Hence, compendia in ROE Handbooks, such as the San Remo Handbook, only provide ROE options that can comply with international law.
Often, violations of the [[laws of armed conflict]] are confused with violations of rules of engagement. Insofar as ROE generally regulate the amount or type of force that can be used in a given circumstance,&lt;ref&gt;San Remo Handbook p.1&lt;/ref&gt; ROE violations are typically related to the use of excessive or unauthorized force or actions. Violations of the laws of armed conflict, on the other hand, consist of violations of the treaties and customary law that make up the laws of armed conflict. 

ROE can not be used to negate an individual's right to defend oneself from an attack.  If, in peacetime, an individual uses force in self defence, or in the defence of others, then attention must be turned to whether or not that force was reasonable and necessary in the circumstances..

==Growth==
[[File:Sabra hummus container.jpg|thumb|A container of Sabra hummus]]
The company was founded in 1986 as Sabra-Blue &amp; White Foods. The company was bought in 2005 by [[Israel]]i food manufacturer [[Strauss (company)|Strauss]]. In March 2008, Strauss entered a joint-venture partnership with [[Frito-Lay]], a division of the multinational [[PepsiCo]] corporation. Strauss owns 50% and PepsiCo 50% of the company.&lt;ref name=wasserman/&gt;&lt;ref name=sabra/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strauss-group.com/brand/sabra/|title=Strauss Group brands: Sabra|publisher=Strauss Group|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, the company announced the construction of a new $61 million plant in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], expected to employ 260 people and come on line in mid-2010.&lt;ref name=kaine&gt;{{cite press release|format=PDF|title=Governor Kaine Announces Sabra Dipping Company Will Open a New Food Manufacturing Plant in Chesterfield County|publisher=Virginia's Gateway Region Economic Development Organization|date=November 19, 2008|url=http://www.gatewayregion.com/uploads/documents/11.19.08_Sabra_Dipping_Company.pdf|accessdate=September 5, 2009|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pr&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabra Dipping Company, a Joint Venture Between Strauss Group and PepsiCo, Announced Plans to Open a State-of-the-art Plant in Richmond, Virginia|publisher=PRNewswire.uk|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/sabra-dipping-company-a-joint-venture-between-strauss-group-and-pepsico-announced-plans-to-open-a-state-of-the-art-plant-in-richmond-virginia-152873985.html|date=November 24, 2008|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company grew over 50% between August 2008 and August 2009.&lt;ref name=nyblue/&gt;

By 2016, Sabra had gained a 60% market share of hummus in the United States,&lt;ref name=scott/&gt; and, through its co-ownership and sales channels with [[PepsiCo]], was close to $1 billion in annual sales.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt; To parallel the rising consumer demand for hummus, American farmers have increased their production of chickpeas four-fold since 2009, harvesting more than {{Convert|100000000|lb|kg}} in 2015, up from about {{Convert|25000000|lb|kg}} in 2009.&lt;ref name="justin"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justin R.

==Marketing==
During the run-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Sabra commissioned sculptor Kirk Rademaker to create [[bust (sculpture)|bust]]s of candidates John McCain, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton out of 100 pounds of hummus.&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite news|author=Theresa Howard|title=Ad Track: Winning ads really work for consumers|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2008-06-29-cannes-lion-winners-consumers_N.htm|date=June 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025082731/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2008-06-29-cannes-lion-winners-consumers_N.htm|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabra launched its first U.S. national advertising campaign in March 2009, with the [[StrawberryFrog]] ad agency.&lt;ref name=wasserman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Amy Martinez|author2=Melissa Allison|title=Savory Moment's customers come to the aid of its founder|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=March 13, 2009|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/business/local-business/savory-moments-customers-come-to-the-aid-of-its-founder/|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, the company began a series of promotional events in which it recreated "Mediterranean villages" in 11 major U.S. cities.&lt;ref name=pr2&gt;{{cite news|title=Sabra Takes a Mediterranean Village on Tour across North America|publisher=PR Web|date=May 19, 2009|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2009/05/prweb2430344.htm|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, Sabra had established greater presence among American and Canadian consumers by marketing a "cultural movement" based on a desire for people to experience hummus as an old world food with new tastes close to what they already knew.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;

==Boycott campaigns==
Until 2010, the [[Strauss (company)|Strauss Group]] stated on their English-language website that the company donates food packages to the [[Golani Brigade]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ron Friedman|author2=Stephanie Hodes|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Strauss-reposts-IDF-support-commitment-on-website|title=Strauss reposts IDF-support commitment on website|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=December 14, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michal Toiba|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Strauss-Group-removes-support-for-IDF-from-website|title=Strauss Group removes support for IDF from website|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists in the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign have called for boycotts of Sabra products over the donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qconline.com/news/illinois/depaul-students-reject-ouster-hummus-brand/article_8de4c500-c138-5f4d-9c95-f8edf89bcc0c.html|title=DePaul students reject ouster hummus brand|work=Quad-Cities Online|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student groups at [[DePaul University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Ottawa]] campaigned unsuccessfully to have their schools switch to alternate brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.578824|title=Canadian university students launch Sabra hummus boycott|work=Haaretz.com|date=March 9, 2014|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tamar Lewin|title=New Subject of Debate on Mideast: Hummus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/education/04hummus.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 3, 2010|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hummus recalls==
On 8 April 2015, Sabra recalled 30,000 cases of its classic hummus after a tub in Michigan tested positive for ''[[Listeria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rachel Abrams|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/business/listeria-in-sabra-hummus-prompts-new-wave-of-recalls.html|title=Listeria in Sabra Hummus Prompts New Wave of Recalls|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspectors with the [[Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development]] (MDARD) learned of the possible contamination by ''[[Listeria monocytogenes|L. monocytogenes]]'' after routine inspections on March 30th at a [[Kroger]] in [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], according to MDARD spokeswoman Jennifer Holton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Erb|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/04/08/listeria-detected-hummus/25491479/|title=Listeria detection prompts national recall by Sabra|publisher=Detroit Free Press|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2016, Sabra voluntarily recalled multiple hummus varieties across the U.S. after ''[[Listeria]]'' was discovered at one of its manufacturing plants, though the company stated the bacteria had not been found in any of its actual products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ralph Ellis|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/health/hummus-sabra-recalled|title=Sabra hummus products recalled over Listeria concerns|publisher=CNN|date=November 19, 2016|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Section 34''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' is the last section of [[Canada]]'s Charter of Rights, which is entrenched in the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]''.  Section 34 provides guidance for the [[legal citation]] of the ''Charter''.

The section has been interpreted by Canadian writers, who have analyzed both its intention and its meaning. Because the section affirms the name of the ''Charter'' and thus entrenches it in the ''Constitution Act'', it came into focus in 1994 when a [[House of Commons of Canada|Member of Parliament]] (MP) proposed to change the name of the ''Charter''.

==Text==
Under the heading "Citation," the section reads:

{{cquote|34. This Part may be cited as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.}}

==Function==
Section 34, as part of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', came into force on April 17, 1982.  According to the [[government of Canada]], section 34's function "simply" relates to citation.  The section clarifies that the first 34 sections of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' may be collectively called the "''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms''," which is an "[[official]] name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/pdp-hrp/canada/guide/citation_e.cfm |title=Guide to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|work=Human Rights Program|publisher=Canadian Heritage|accessdate=2009-08-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070318173641/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/pdp-hrp/canada/guide/citation_e.cfm |archivedate = 2007-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would be the name of the [[English language|English]] version.  The [[French language|French]] version of section 34 states "Titre de la présente partie: ''Charte canadienne des droits et libertés''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Charte canadienne des droits et libertés|language=French|publisher=Patrimoine canadien|accessdate=2009-08-11|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection/CH37-4-3-2002F.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, constitutional scholar [[Peter Hogg]] suggested that the section also clarifies the size and scope of the ''Charter.''  Only section 34 and the sections that come before it compose the ''Charter''.  The next sections of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', including [[Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982|section 35]] (which affirms [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] rights) and section 36 (which affirms [[equalization payments]]), are thus not Charter rights.  This is significant, since [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' allows for limits on ''Charter'' rights, so it cannot apply to sections 35 or 36.  However, this also means that a "judicial remedy" under [[Section Twenty-four of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 24]] of the Act is not available for sections 35 or 36, since section 24 refers only to the ''Charter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter W.|last=Hogg|title=Canada Act 1982 Annotated|place=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=The Carswell Company Limited|year=1982|page=81|isbn=0-459-35130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
[[File:Russell MacLellan.jpg|left|thumb|150 px|Parliamentary Secretary [[Russell MacLellan]] argued against amending section 34 in 1994.]]
Canadian poet [[George Elliott Clarke]] once analyzed section 34, calling it "bland [[Legal writing#Legalese|legalese]]."  He wrote it was "reassuring" because it was dull, signalling neither fear nor excitement.  Thus, it seemed to imply the ''Charter of Rights'' was not a radical constitutional change, despite the fact that it was potentially revolutionary for a [[constitutional monarchy]].  In considering the name ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,'' Clarke felt the first word, "Canadian," hinted at [[Canadian nationalism]].  He then compared this to the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights]], saying that those documents were written by men who had just emerged from conflict and still remembered it, and thus Canada could be duller.  However, he noted there was some drama in the ''Charter'' in that it was written when there was a threat of [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]], and [[Section Twenty-seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 27]] (multiculturalism), [[Section Twenty-five of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 25]] (Aboriginal rights), and [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15(2)]] (affirmative action) of the ''Charter'' could change the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=George Elliott|last=Clarke|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rights-and-freedoms/023021-1200-e.html|title=On 'This Part may be cited as the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'|work=Building a Just Society:  A Retrospective of Canadian Rights and Freedoms|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=2009-08-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310160522/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rights-and-freedoms/023021-1200-e.html |archivedate=

In 1994, the [[House of Commons of Canada]] debated changing the name of the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' to the ''Canadian Charter of Rights, Freedoms and Responsibilities''. As Parliamentary Secretary [[Russell MacLellan]] pointed out, this would have to be done through a [[constitutional amendment]], particularly to section 34, since section 34 "establishes the charter's title.  The charter's title is thus part of the Constitution."  MacLellan believed the [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|amending formula]] needed would be the one requiring the support of seven provincial governments representing at least half of Canada's population.  [[Edmonton Southwest]] MP [[Ian McClelland]] had suggested the change, believing it to be necessary because "I felt we were becoming a nation of entitlement."  MacLellan replied that "The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is and aspires to be a statement by Canadians about the rights and freedoms which we as Canadians deeply value in our democratic society."  MacLellan added that section 1 implied a need for responsibilities, so "It is not necessary to change the title of this charter to emphasize the integral relationship between the individual's rights and his or her responsibility to the rest of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Parliament of Canada|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?pub=hansard&amp;mee=103&amp;parl=35&amp;ses=1&amp;language=E#103RP1E.html|title=Publications - October 4, 1994|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3493">'''Section 8''' is a category of [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]], used for a service member judged [[Mental disorder|mentally unfit]] for service. Section 8 was often given to [[homosexuals]], [[bisexuals]], [[cross-dressers]] and [[transgender people]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Bronski]]; ''A Queer History of the United States''; &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term Section 8 eventually came to mean any service member given such a discharge or behaving as if deserving such a discharge, as in the expression, "he's a Section 8". The term comes from Section VIII of the [[World War II]]-era United States Army Regulation 615-360, which provided for the discharge of those deemed unfit for military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Medical History - Neuropsychiatry in WWII, Chapter 16|publisher=United States Department of the Army|date=1963|url=http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/NeuropsychiatryinWWIIVolI/chapter16.htm|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 8 discharge was often given to homosexuals, bisexuals, [[cross-dressers]] and [[transgender people]] as they were deemed mentally unfit to serve in the military. A Section 8 discharge often made it dificult for people to find work in civilian life and did not allow veterans benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Bronski]]; ''A Queer History of the United States''; &lt;/ref&gt;

Discharge under Section 8 is no longer practiced, as medical discharges for psychological/psychiatric reasons are now covered by a number of regulations. In the Army, such discharges are handled under the provisions of AR 635-200, Active Duty Enlisted Administrative Separations. Chapter 5, paragraph 13 governs the separation of personnel medically diagnosed with a [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active Duty Enlisted Administrative Separations|publisher=United States Department of the Army|date=2005-06-05|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r635_200.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
Section 8 became a household phrase when used in the 1970s TV series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', in which the character [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Maxwell Klinger|Corporal Klinger]] was continually seeking one (until he eventually abandoned his efforts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M*A*S*H Episode Guide - Radar's Report|publisher=The editors of TV.com|date=1973-09-02|url=http://www.tv.com/mash/radars-report/episode/43226/summary.html|accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His preferred method of doing so was [[cross-dressing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicole Markotic]]; ''Disability in Film and Literature''; 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas L.

{{Quran}}
The '''Sword Verse''' (''ayat as-[[saif|sayf]]'') is the fifth verse of the ninth [[sura]] (or ''[[At-Tawba|Surat at-Tawbah]]'' ) of the [[Qur'an]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv9q7FhWj1UC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;dq=understanding+the+quran+sword+verse&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyyaeXp5DTAhUhxlQKHR9tCSYQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=understanding%20the%20quran%20sword%20verse&amp;f=false|title=The Qur'an|last=|first=|date=2004-05-13|publisher=OUP Oxford|year=|isbn=9780192805485|location=|pages=xxiii|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also written as 9:5). It is a Qur'anic verse widely cited by critics of Islam to suggest the faith promotes violence against "pagans" ("idolators", ''[[Shirk (Islam)|mushrikun]]''), by isolating the portion of the verse "fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them" ({{lang|ar-Latn|fa-uq'tulū  l-mush'rikīna ḥaythu wajadttumūhum}} {{lang|ar|فَاقْتُلُوا الْمُشْرِكِينَ حَيْثُ وَجَدْتُمُوهُمْ |rtl=yes}}; trans. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=9&amp;verse=5 "Quran Chapter 9 Verse 5"]&lt;/ref&gt; The next immediate verse (often excluded from quotes) appears to present a conditional reprieve within the statement: "if any of the idolaters seeks of thee protection, grant him protection till he hears the words of God; then do thou convey him to his place of security -- that, because they are a people who do not know."&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=9&amp;verse=6 "Quran Chapter 9 Verse 6"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Qur’anic exegetes [[al-Baydawi]] and [[Mahmud al-Alusi|al-Alusi]] explain that it refers to those pagan Arabs who violated their peace treaties by waging war against the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Anwar al-Tanzeel wa Asrar al-Ta’weel, al-Baydawi, (9:5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruh al-Ma'ani|Rūḥ al-ma‘ānī fī tafsīr al-Qur’ān al-‘aẓīm wa-al-sab‘ al-mathānī]], Mahmud al-Alusi, (9:5).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Giving context to the verse are the first seven verses of ''[[At-Tawba|Surat at-Tawbah]]'', with the number of the verse given after, not before, the verse (the "Sword Verse" being the fifth):

{{Quotation|An acquittal, from God and His Messenger, unto the idolaters with whom you made covenant: (1) 'Journey freely in the land for four months; and know that you cannot frustrate the will of God, and that God degrades the unbelievers.' (2) A proclamation, from God and His Messenger, unto mankind on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage: 'God is quit, and His Messenger, of the idolaters. So if you repent, that will be better for you; but if you turn your backs; know that you cannot frustrate the will of God. And give thou good tidings to the unbelievers of a painful chastisement; (3) excepting those of the idolaters with whom you made covenant, then they failed. you naught neither lent support to any man against you. With them fulfil your covenant till their term; surely God loves the godfearing. (4) Then, when the sacred months are drawn away, slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them, and confine them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms, then let them go their way; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate. (5) And if any of the idolaters seeks of thee protection, grant him protection till he hears the words of God; then do thou convey him to his place of security -- that, because they are a people who do not know. (6) How should the idolaters have a covenant with God and His Messenger? -- excepting those with whom you made covenant at the Holy Mosque; so long as they go straight with you, do you go straight with them; surely God loves the godfearing. (7)|Trans. [[Arthur John Arberry|Arberry]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur John Arberry]], [[The Koran Interpreted]], (9:1-7).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interpretations==
According to several mainstream Islamic scholars, the verse relates to a specific event in Islamic history -- namely that Arabian pagans made and broke a covenant with Arabic Muslims. The verses immediately preceding and following 9:5, 9:4 and 9:6, make the context very clear: Only those pagans who broke the covenant were subject to violent repercussions, so that any pagans who honoured the covenant or repented their betrayal were to be spared. Commentating on the following verse, 9:6, [[Asma Afsaruddin]] brings the position of different early commentators, and the overall direction taken is that it concerns the Arab polytheists and doesn't translate into indiscriminate killing: &lt;blockquote&gt;[[Mujahid ibn Jabr|Mujāhid]] said that this verse guarantees the safety of people in general (insān) who came to listen to the Prophet recite from the Qur’ān until they had returned to the place of refuge whence they came.

The [[Tanwir al-Miqbas|Tanwīr al-miqbās]] says that the verse commands the Prophet to grant safe conduct to anyone from among the polytheists who asks for it, so that he may hear the recitation of the speech of God. If he does not believe (sc. embrace Islam), then he is to be granted safe passage back to his land (waṭanahu). This is so because they are a people ignorant of the commandments of God and His oneness.

Hūd b. Muḥakkam similarly comments that the polytheist who requests safe conduct from Muslims in order to listen to the word of God is to be so granted and returned unharmed to his place of origin, whether he embraces Islam or not. This was the view of Mujāhid, for example. Al-Kalbî quoted as saying that the verse referred instead to a group of polytheists who wished to renew their pact with Muḥammad after the sacred months had passed. When Muḥammad asked them to profess Islam, off er prayers, and pay the zakāt , they refused, and the Prophet let them return safely to their homes. Ibn Muḥakkam further notes that [[Hasan of Basra|al-Ḥasan al-Basrī]] had remarked thus on the status of this verse: “It is valid and unabrogated (muḥkama) until the Day of Judgment.”

[[Ali Ibn Ibrahim Qomi|Al-Qummî]] affirms briefly that this verse asks Muslims to recite the Qur’ān to the polytheist, explain it to him, and not show him any opposition until he returns safely. It is worth noting that [[Tafsir Furat Kufi|Furāt]] regards Qur’ān 9:6 as abrogating Qur’ān 9:5 and thus overriding the seemingly blanket injunction concerning the polytheists contained in the latter verse. In this he agrees with many of his predecessors that the polytheist who wishes for safe conduct in order to listen to the word of God should be so granted and then peacefully escorted back to his home, regardless of whether he had embraced Islam or not. 

[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Ṭabarî]] says that in this verse God counsels Muḥammad, “If someone from among the polytheists (al-mushrikīn)—those whom I have commanded that you fight and slay after the passage of the sacred months—were to ask you, O Muḥammad, for safe conduct in order to listen to the word of God, then grant this protection to him so that he may hear the word of God and you may recite it to him.” Such an individual, according to the verse, is to be subsequently escorted back to his place of safety even if he rejects Islam and fails to believe after the Prophet’s recitation of the Qur’ān before him. Scholars in the past who have agreed with this general interpretation include [[Ibn Ishaq|Ibn Isḥāq]], al-Suddî, and Mujāhid (as above).&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Afsaruddin]], ''Striving in the Path of God: Jihad and Martyrdom in Islamic Thought'', OUP USA (2013), pp. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same breath, still on 9:6, bringing later scholars and Qur'anic commentators, she mentions that "in his similarly brief commentary, [[Al-Zamakhshari|al-Zamakhsharî]] explains this verse quite literally—that if one of the polytheists, with whom no pact (mīthāq) exists, were to request safe conduct from the Muslims in order to listen to the Qur’ān, then he should be granted it so that he may reflect upon God’s words. Afterward, he is to be escorted back to his home where he feels safe. This, al-Zamakhsharî says, is established practice for all time." Concerning the influential [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], "unlike previous exegetes, al-Rāzī further comments that this verse indicates that imitation of precedent (al-taqlīd) is not sufficient in religion, and that critical inquiry (al-nazar) and the seeking of proofs (al-istidlāl) are indispensable requirements within religion. If emulation of precedent were enough, he argues, then this verse would not have granted a respite to this unbeliever, and he would have been merely given a choice between professing his belief [in Islam] or death. As this did not occur, it confi rms that Muslims are required to off er safe conduct to such a person and thereby assuage his fears and allow him the opportunity to deliberate upon the proofs of religion." While for [[al-Qurtubi]], the famous Andalusian scholar, he "dismisses as invalid the views of those who say that this verse’s injunction was valid only for the four months mentioned in the preceding verse. On the basis of the occasion of revelation cited by [[Sa'id ibn Jubayr|Sa‘īd b. Jubayr]] (as previously discussed) and on the authority of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|‘Alī b. Abī Ṭālib]], al-Qurṭubī concludes that this verse is muḥkam and valid for all time."&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Afsaruddin]], ''Striving in the Path of God: Jihad and Martyrdom in Islamic Thought'', OUP USA (2013), pp. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt;

As per [[Muhammad Abdel-Haleem]], translator of the Qur'an, while contextualizing 9:5 and bringing the wider sequential narrative: &lt;blockquote&gt;It was these hardened polytheists in Arabia, who would accept nothing other than the expulsion of the Muslims or their reversion to paganism, and who repeatedly broke their treaties, that the Muslims were ordered to treat in the same way – to fight them or expel them.

Even with such an enemy Muslims were not simply ordered to pounce on them and reciprocate by breaking the treaty themselves; instead, an ultimatum was issued, giving the enemy notice, that after the four sacred months mentioned in 9:5 above, the Muslims would wage war on them. The main clause of the sentence ‘kill the polytheists’ is singled out by some Western scholars to represent the Islamic attitude to war; even some Muslims take this view and allege that this verse abrogated other verses on war. This is pure fantasy, isolating and decontextualising a small part of a sentence. The full picture is given in 9:1–15, which gives many reasons for the order to fight such polytheists. They continuously broke their agreements and aided others against the Muslims, they started hostilities against the Muslims, barred others from becoming Muslims, expelled Muslims from the Holy Mosque and even from their own homes. At least eight times the passage mentions their misdeeds against the Muslims. Consistent with restrictions on war elsewhere in the Qur’an, the immediate context of this ‘Sword Verse’ exempts such polytheists as do not break their agreements and who keep the peace with the Muslims (9:7). It orders that those enemies seeking safe conduct should be protected and delivered to the place of safety they seek (9:6). The whole of this context to v.5, with all its restrictions, is ignored by those who simply isolate one part of a sentence to build their theory of war in Islam on what is termed ‘The Sword Verse’ even when the word ‘sword’ does not occur anywhere in the Qur’an.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Abdel Haleem, ''Understanding the Qur'an: Themes and Style'', [[I.B. Tauris]] (2001), pp.65-66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Maher Hathout]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;This verse was revealed towards the end of the revelation period and relates to a limited context. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious. One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur'an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur'an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. (9:6).&lt;ref&gt;Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Patricia Crone]] states that the verse is directed against a particular group accused of oath-breaking and aggression and excepts those polytheists who remained faithful. Crone states that this verse seems to be based on the same above-mentioned rules. Here also it is stressed that one must cease fighting when the enemy does.&lt;ref name="Crone"&gt;Patricia Crone, "War" in ''[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]'' (2006), p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejecting the idea of abrogation ([[Naskh (tafsir)|naskh]]), the influential Islamic reformist scholar [[Muhammad Abduh]] "citing the views of [[Al-Suyuti|al-Suyūṭī]], ‘Abduh argues that in the specific historical situation with which the verse is concerned—with its references to the passage of the four sacred months and the pagan Meccans—other verses in the Qur’ān advocating forgiveness and nonviolence were not abrogated by it, but rather placed in temporary abeyance or suspension (laysa naskhan bal huwa min qism al-mansa’) in that specific historical circumstance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Afsaruddin]], ''Striving in the Path of God: Jihad and Martyrdom in Islamic Thought'', OUP USA (2013), pp. 238-239&lt;/ref&gt; Another modern Qur'anic scholar, [[Muhammad Asad]], also states that the permission to fight and kill was restricted to specific tribes already at war with the Muslims who had breached their peace agreements and attacked them first.&lt;ref&gt;Asad, Muhammad. ''[[The Message of the Qur'an]]'', 1980. Redwood Books, Wiltshire, Great Britain.  p. 256, Footnote 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For similar arguments see also e.g. Hesham A. Hassaballa, [http://www.altmuslim.com/a/a/c_hhassablla Articles]; [http://godfaithpen.blogspot.com/2005/04/does-islam-call-for-murder-of-infidels_25.html "Does Islam Call For The Murder of 'Infidels'"]; [[Zakir Naik]], [http://www.islamicvoice.com/April2006/Facts&amp;Faith "Terrorism and Jihad: An Islamic Perspective"].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The founder of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], [[Hassan al-Banna]], held the same views, that "the sword verse was directed only at polytheists and not at the People of the Book", as, in his words, it contradicted Qur'anic verses “which
decree inviting to Islam with wisdom and good counsel and attribute to God the final adjudication of differences on the Day of Judgment.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Afsaruddin]], ''Striving in the Path of God: Jihad and Martyrdom in Islamic Thought'', OUP USA (2013), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Generally attached to the MB, at least informally, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] too believes that 9:5 is contextual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Afsaruddin]], ''Striving in the Path of God: Jihad and Martyrdom in Islamic Thought'', OUP USA (2013), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

The late authoritative [[Syrians|Syrian]] scholar, [[Mohamed Said Ramadan Al-Bouti]], followed the same thinking, as he "comments that if Qur’ān 9:5 is understood to command the fighting of polytheists until their death or their acceptance of Islam, then such a command is countermanded by the very next verse that exhorts Muslims to offer refuge and safe conduct to polytheists while they are in their state of polytheism. He dismisses as irresponsibly arbitrary the view of those who suggest that Qur’ān 9:5 abrogates Qur’ān 9:6; this goes against the usual rule of abrogation that a later verse may supersede an earlier verse, and he stresses that their understanding of Qur’ān 9:5 contradicts other, more numerous verses of the Qur’ān that were later revelations and the praxis of the Companions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Asma Afsaruddin]], ''Striving in the Path of God: Jihad and Martyrdom in Islamic Thought'', OUP USA (2013), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar interpretation of the verse as limited to [[defensive war|defensive warfare]] is also found in [[Ahmadiyya]] literature, notably in [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]]'s 1936 ''The Religion of Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad. ''[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/religionislam/religionislammuhammadali.shtml The Religion of Islam]''. The Ahmadiyya Anjuman Isha’at Islam (Lahore) USA, 1990. Chapter V, "Jihad", page 414. &lt;/ref&gt; In [[The English Commentary of the Holy Quran]], which is a collective commentary supervised by the fourth caliph of the Ahmadis, [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], and reuniting views of their second caliph, [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad]], as well as well-known Ahmadi scholars like [[Mirza Bashir Ahmad]], [[Maulvi Sher Ali]] and [[Malik Ghulam Farid]], concerning 9:5 we can read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To wage war after the expiry of the four forbidden months did not apply to all idolaters without exception but was directed only against such avowed enemies of Islam as had themselves started hostilities against Islam and had broker their plighted word and plotted to expel de Holy Prophet from the city. The reason for this ultimate is given in the following few verses, viz. 9:8-13. As for those idolaters who had not been guilty of faithlessness and treachery, they were to be protected (see 9:4, 7). It is highly regrettable, however, that, divorcing this commandment from its context, some critics have made this verse the basis for an attack against Islam, alleging that it inculcates the destruction of all non-Muslims. The Quran and history belie that baseless allegation.&lt;ref&gt;The Holy Quran with English translation and commentary, volume 5, p. 910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These companion cases are said to have reached the "high-water mark of the patent misuse doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kVGY0Wi6nlcC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false George Gordon &amp; Robert J. Hoerner], ''Overview and Historical Development of the Misuse Doctrine'', in {{smallcaps|ABA Section Of Antitrust Law, Intellectual Property Misuse: Licensing And Litigation}} 1, 15 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The Court substantially limited the contributory infringement doctrine by holding unlawful tie-ins of "non-staple" unpatented articles that were specially adapted only for use in practicing a patent, and the Court observed: "The result of this decision, together with those which have preceded it, is to limit substantially the doctrine of contributory infringement. What residuum may be left we need not stop to consider."&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 669.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also suggested that an attempt to extend the reach of a patent beyond its claims could or would violate the antitrust laws: "The legality of any attempt to bring unpatented goods within the protection of the patent is measured by the antitrust laws, not by the patent law."&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 684.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the ''Mercoid'' cases, the patent bar eventually persuaded Congress to limit the sweep of these rulings&lt;ref&gt;''Dawson Chem. Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.'', 448 U.S. 176, 200 (1980): "Certain segments of the patent bar eventually decided to ask Congress for corrective legislation that would restore some scope to the contributory infringement doctrine. With great perseverance, they advanced their proposal in three successive Congresses before it eventually was enacted in 1952...."&lt;/ref&gt; by enacting sections 271(c) and (d) of the patent code in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;35 U.S.C. §&amp;nbsp;271(c)–(d).&lt;/ref&gt; Those provisions rolled back to some extent the law on contributory infringement and tie-ins. Subsection (c) defined unlawful contributory infringement as the knowing sale of a non-staple product that is a material part of the invention and is specially adapted for the infringement of the patent—essentially, products without any use except infringement. Subsection (d) made it not misuse or illegal extension of patent rights for a patentee to derive revenue from what would be contributory infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See {{smallcaps|ABA, Intellectual Property Misuse: Licensing And Litigation}} at 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court in 1980 characterized this legislation limiting ''Mercoid'' as a compromise between the doctrines of  misuse and contributory infringement.&lt;ref&gt;"The approach that Congress took toward the codification of contributory infringement and patent misuse reveals a compromise between those two doctrines and their competing policies that permits patentees to exercise control over non-staple articles used in their inventions. Section 271(c) identifies the basic dividing line between contributory infringement and patent misuse. It adopts a restrictive definition of contributory infringement that distinguishes between staple and nonstaple articles of commerce. It also defines the class on nonstaple items narrowly."

==Background==

[[File:The_Cross_Furnace_Control_System.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Cross Furnace Control System]]
[[File:Freeman_Furnace_System.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Freeman Furnace System]]

===The inventions===

Walter M. Cross invented a hot-air furnace system with three main elements: (1) a motor driven stoker for feeding fuel to the combustion chamber of a furnace, (2) a room thermostatic switch for controlling the feeding of fuel, and (3) a combustion stoker switch to prevent the fire's going out in warm weather not requiring domestic heating. The room thermostat the supply of heat, or discontinues its supply, by closing or opening the circuit to the stoker motor at the required temperatures. The combustion stoker switch, or holdfire control, responds to a low temperature in the furnace by causing the stoker to feed fuel so as to prevent the furnace fire from going out. The control of the combustion stoker switch is effective in mild weather when the room thermostat may not call for heat for a considerable period.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 664.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward E. Freeman invented a system to control a hot air furnace that uses three thermostatic switches for its operation. A room thermostat starts the stoker. Another thermostat (or limit switch) opens the stoker circuit when the air in the furnace reaches a predetermined temperature, irrespective of the fact that the room thermostat may still call for heat. This second thermostat operates to prevent unsafe conditions due to overheating. The third thermostat is also in the furnace. It controls a fan which forces hot air from the furnace to the rooms. It does not permit the fan to start until the air in the furnace reaches a specified degree of heat. But, at that point, it starts the fan, which continues to run, even though the limit switch has stopped the stoker, so long as the furnace is hot and the room thermostat calls for heat. The patent was on the combination patent of three thermostatic switches, not on any of the switches alone and not on the combination of the fan switch and the limit switch.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 682.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitation of patents===

The Cross patent was assigned to Mid-Continent, subject to a prior exclusive license to Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company (Honeywell) in the field of coal stokers. It was agreed that the patent royalty Honeywell would pay would be based on its sales of a combustion stoker control unit: an automatic electric switch responsive to temperatures of combustion gases or boiler water produced by an automatic coal fed stoker. Honeywell granted a sub-license to Detroit Lubricator Co. to make and sell combustion stoker switches and related apparatus for practicing the Cross invention. Mid-Continent, the patent owner, made no heating equipment but derived its revenue from royalties on the combustion stoker switch devices that Honeywell and Detroit Lubricator. Honeywell sent a letter to the trade advising it of the exclusive license, explaining that the patent rights cover a system involving the controls and the stoker in combination and not the controls alone, and offering a license on the entire system to purchasers of one of Honeywell's control units. Later, Mid-Continent sent a letter to the trade advising that it owned the patent rights and that the sale of equipment for practicing the patented invention was infringement unless licensed. Mid-Continent wrote a customer of Mercoid that it had learned that the customer was purchasing controls from a company (i.e., Mercoid) not licensed by Mid-Continent to sell controls; and that Mid-Continent wished to make this a formal notification that it considered the sale and use of controls for this purpose an infringement of its patent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/mid-continent-inv-co-v-mercoid-corporation-2 ''Mid-Continent Inv. Co. v. Mercoid Corp.''], 43 F. Supp. 692, 694-95 (N.D. Ill. 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freeman patent was assigned to Honeywell, which licensed five of its manufacturing competitors. The licenses grant a nonexclusive right to make, use, and sell a "combination furnace control" which is defined as a thermostatic switch usable for a Freeman installation and designed in one unit to control the fan and limit circuits. Royalty payments to Honeywell are based on the sales of the combination furnace controls, which are not patented as such (the system that includes them is patented) but have no use except in practicing the patent. The court of appeals said that the combination furnace control provides "the sequence of operations which is the precise essence of Freeman's advance in the art," in that it "accomplish[es] the sequence of operations of the Freeman patent" and "distinguish[ed] the invention" from the prior art.
Each licensee was required to provide a notice to the effect that purchasing the control confers a license for one installation of the Freeman heating system. Minneapolis-Honeywell tried on several occasions to induce Mercoid to take a license but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 682-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proceedings in lower courts===

====Trial courts====

=====&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cross patent=====

In November 1932, Mid-Continent mailed Mercoid a formal notice of infringement of the Cross patent. In August 1935, Mid-Continent brought suit against E.O. Smith of Carthage, Missouri, for infringement of the Cross patent by installing in his home a heating system including controls manufactured by Mercoid. Mercoid provided the defense of Smith but was not made a party to the suit. Mid-Continent prevailed against Smith. In September 1940, Mid-Continent sued Mercoid in Chicago federal district court for contributory infringement of the Cross patent. Mercoid, Mid-Continent, and Honeywell did not make heating systems; they sold thermostatic switches and related products. On Mercoid's motion, the court made Honeywell an involuntary co-plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/mid-continent-inv-co-v-mercoid-corporation-2 ''Mid-Continent Inv. Co. v. Mercoid Corp.''], 43 F. Supp. 692, 693 (N.D. Ill. 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

The district court found that Honeywell and Mid-Continent "have in collusion conspired with each other in an attempt to monopolize the sale of combustion stoker switches, stoker controls or low limit controls, not covered by the Cross [patent]." It also held that the eight year delay between the 1932 notice and the 1940 suit constituted [[Laches (equity)|laches]] precluding the action. The court concluded that the method of doing business was "the practical equivalent of granting a written license with the condition that the patented system may be practiced only with combustion stoker switches purchased from" licensees, thus running afoul of ''Carbice'' and ''Leitch''. In addition to being patent misuse, the plaintiffs' conduct violated the antitrust law and made Mercoid entitled to an injunction against it.&lt;ref&gt;43 F. Supp. at 695-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court ordered that the complaint should be dismissed, and enjoined each plaintiff from bringing suit for contributory infringement of the patent against Mercoid's customers, and from directly or indirectly threatening its customers with suit for such infringement of the patent, or in any manner interfering with Mercoid's business by use of the patent. On the antitrust claim, the court denied damages but ordered a perpetual injunction against both plaintiffs, their officers and agents, both individually and collectively, from doing the following things:
# From further engaging in or carrying out said conspiracy or any other conspiracy having a similar purpose or effect;
# From doing any act or thing having the same purpose or effect as the acts done in pursuance of such controversy, or promoting, or tending to promote the purpose or effect thereof involving the patent in suit; and
# From enforcing or carrying out, directly or indirectly, any of the provisions of the Honeywell license or its sub-licenses, or any similar licenses of the same tenor or effect, which involve the patent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/133/803/1544630/ ''Mid-Continent Inv. Co. v. Mercoid Corp.''], 133 F.2d 803, 806 (7th Cir. 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Freeman patent=====

In June 1940 Mercoid sued Honeywell and Mid-Continent in Chicago federal district court for a declaratory judgment that its fan and limit controls did not infringe or contribute to the infringement of Honeywell's Freeman patent, that the patent was invalid, and that Honeywell was restraining trade in violation of the antitrust laws. Honeywell counterclaimed and sued for patent infringement. The district court held the patent not shown invalid but misused. The court explained the misuse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]t must be held that Minneapolis-Honeywell has been so using its patent as to tend to create a monopoly in an unpatented device. Minneapolis-Honeywell has been licensing others and has offered to license Mercoid to manufacture, use and sell a single device which embodies within itself two elements of the Freeman patent, namely, the two thermostats which are placed in the furnace hood, one being the fan switch and the other being the limit switch. This device, embodying these two elements, is .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. an unpatented device. The Freeman patent is not a patent on either the fan switch or the limit switch or both of them. It is a patent on a system of furnace control, which requires three thermostats for its operation. It happens that two of those thermostats are a fan switch and a limit switch. The court is of the opinion that it follows, from what has been said, that both complaints, that of Mercoid and that of Minneapolis-Honeywell, must be dismissed for want of equity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/mercoid-corporation-v-minneapolis-honeywell-r-co ''Mercoid Corporation v. Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co.''], 43 F.Supp. 878, 881 (N.D. Ill. 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Rulings of Seventh Circuit====

Appeals were taken to the [[Seventh Circuit]], which overturned the district courts' judgments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/133/803/1544630/ ''Mid-Continent Inv. Co. v. Mercoid Corp.''], 133 F.2d 803 (7th Cir. 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cross patent=====

In one case, involving the Cross patent, the court of appeals reversed the rulings as to laches and contributory infringement. It held that Mercoid's conduct in making and selling a device that had no use except in practicing the Cross patent, and providing instructions on how to use the device to carry out the invention, was contributory infringement.&lt;ref&gt;133 F.2d at 808-09 (7th Cir. 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;  By the same token, the court said, "We see nothing here that would violate the antitrust laws or that would constitute unfair competition," and it reversed the district court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;133 F.2d at 811.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Freeman patent=====

In the other case, involving the Freeman patent, the court of appeals held that the principle of ''[[Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.]]'' did not apply and the district court erroneously based its ruling on that case. The ''Morton'' case involved a patented mechanism for depositing salt tablets:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The patent was on the mechanism, not on the salt nor on its configuration. Salt is an article of commerce, quite generally used from time immemorial. It is unpatented and is not an element of the patent upon which Morton relied. However, Morton sought to compel the purchasers of its patented mechanism to use only the salt purchased from it, which was in no sense a part of the patent.&lt;ref&gt;133 F.2d at 813.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In contrast, the Freeman patent covers a furnace control system having a combustion control apparatus as an element of the claimed system. The court said these facts were critical:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The accused device] provides for the sequence of operations which is the precise essence of Freeman's advance in the art. With each [device], Mercoid provides certain wiring diagrams for installation. The accused device has no other use than for accomplishing the sequence of operations of the Freeman patent.&lt;ref&gt;133 F.2d at 813.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court concluded, "The patent laws permit such conduct and the Anti-Trust laws do not forbid it."&lt;ref&gt;133 F.2d at 814.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rulings of Supreme Court==

[[File:Justice William O Douglas.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Justice Douglas around 1940]]

===Cross patent===

Justice [[William O. Douglas]] delivered the opinion of the majority of the Court. Justice [[Owen J. Roberts]], joined by Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed]], dissented. Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]] dissented separately, as did Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]]. Justice [[Hugo Black]], joined by Justice [[Frank Murphy]] wrote a concurring opinion taking issue with the opinion that Justice Frankfurter filed.

====Majority opinion====

Justice Douglas began the majority opinion with the assumptions that the Cross patent was valid and that Mercoid knowingly sold combustion stoker switches for use in practicing the invention claimed in the Cross combination patent.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co.'', 320 U.S. 661, 664 (1944).&lt;/ref&gt;

But ever since the Court in ''[[Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.]]'' overruled ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]'', "this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention." For example: ''[[Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp.]]'', ''[[Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.]]'', ''[[Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.]]'', and ''[[B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis]]''. The reason that the Court has repeatedly so held is that "to allow such suits would be to extend the aid of a court of equity in expanding the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly."&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 664-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

While those cases all involved tie-ins on supplies used in practicing the patented invention, the Court could "see no difference in principle" when the tied item was a component of the patented structure (a claimed element of a patented combination):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The grant of a patent is the grant of a special privilege "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts." Const., Art. I, § 8. It carries, of course, a right to be free from competition in the practice of the invention. But the limits of the patent are narrowly and strictly confined to the precise terms of the grant. It is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system. It is the protection of the public in a system of free enterprise which ,&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;, denies to the patentee after issuance [of the patent] the power to use it in such a way as to acquire a monopoly which is not plainly within the terms of the grant. The necessities or convenience of the patentee do not justify any use of the monopoly of the patent to create another monopoly. The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. The method by which the monopoly is sought to be extended is immaterial. The patent is a privilege. But it is a privilege which is conditioned by a public purpose. It results from invention, and is limited to the invention which it defines. When the patentee ties something else to his invention, he acts only by virtue of his right as the owner of property to make contracts concerning it and not otherwise. He then is subject to all the limitations upon that right which the general law imposes upon such contracts. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [If patent ownership could justify tie-ins] the patent would be diverted from its statutory purpose and become a ready instrument for economic control in domains where the antitrust acts or other laws not the patent statutes define the public policy.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. 665-66 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Returning to the patentee's argument that the stoker switch was central to the invention, the Court insisted that it did not matter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That result may not be obviated in the present case by calling the combustion stoker switch the "heart of the invention" or the "advance in the art." The patent is for a combination only. Since none of the separate elements of the combination is claimed as the invention, none of them when dealt with separately is protected by the patent monopoly. Whether the parts are new or old, the combination is the invention and it is distinct from any of them. If a limited monopoly over the combustion stoker switch were allowed, it would not be a monopoly accorded inventive genius by the patent laws, but a monopoly born of a commercial desire to avoid the rigors of competition fostered by the antitrust laws. If such an expansion of the patent monopoly could be effected by contract, the integrity of the patent system would be seriously compromised.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 667-68 (citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court acknowledged that the 1909 decision in ''Leeds &amp; Catlin v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2)''&lt;ref&gt;213 U.S. 325 (1909).&lt;/ref&gt; was authority for the conclusion that "he who sells an unpatented part of a combination patent for use in the assembled machine may be guilty of contributory infringement." In that case involving a phonograph record and record player, the Court extended patent protection to the unpatented phonograph record, which was an unpatented part of the patented combination. But that ruling "is in substance inconsistent with the view which we have expressed in this case." Accordingly, the rule in that case "must no longer prevail against the defense that a combination patent is being used to protect an unpatented part from competition." To be sure, Honeywell and Mid-Continent could have prevailed against Mercoid on a charge of contributory infringement and secured an injunction "had they not misused the patent for the purpose of monopolizing unpatented material." But they did, and "[w]here there is a collision between the principle of the ''Carbice'' case and the conventional rules governing either direct or contributory infringement, the former prevails."&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 668-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court then announced the controversial summary of it holding that later raised a storm of opposition that led to an amendment (see below) of the patent laws limiting the ''Mercoid'' ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The result of this decision, together with those which have preceded it, is to limit substantially the doctrine of contributory infringement. What residuum may be left we need not stop to consider. It is sufficient to say that, in whatever posture the issue may be tendered, courts of equity will withhold relief where the patentee and those claiming under him are using the patent privilege contrary to the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the Court turned to the issues of''[[res judicata]]'' and Mercoid's antitrust counterclaim, on which several justices dissented.

Mercoid knew of Mid-Continent's actions and the license agreement prior to 1935 when the earlier ''Smith'' suit involving the validity of the Cross patent occurred, and in which Mercoid defended its customer Smith. The contention therefore was that the doctrine of ''res judicata'' "binds Mercoid as respects issues which were actually litigated and all issues which might have been raised in that earlier suit." As to ''res judicata'', the Court said that Honeywell and Mid-Continent:

&lt;blockquote&gt;ask the equity court for an injunction against infringement by petitioner of the patent in question, and for an accounting. Should such a decree be entered, the Court would be placing its imprimatur on a scheme which involves a misuse of the patent privilege and a violation of the antitrust laws. It would aid in the consummation of a conspiracy to expand a patent beyond its legitimate scope. But patentees and licensees cannot secure aid from the court to bring such an event to pass, "unless it is in accordance with policy to grant that help." And the determination of that policy is not "at the mercy" of the parties nor dependent on the usual rules governing the settlement of private litigation. Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only private interests are involved. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The parties cannot foreclose the courts from the exercise of that discretion by the failure to interpose the same defense in an earlier litigation.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 670.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The antitrust counterclaim was "more than a defense; it is a separate statutory cause of action." Therefore, the antitrust case is governed by the principle that, "where the second cause of action between the parties is upon a different claim, the prior judgment is ''res judicata'' not as to issues which might have been tendered, but "only as to those matters in issue or points controverted upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered." That relief should be considered on the remand.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 671-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dissenting opinions====

Justice Roberts, joined by Justice Reed, took the position that the ''Leeds &amp; Catlin'' case should be considered good law, so that there was no misuse here. He also believed that the case did not call for an exception to the usual rukes of ''res judicata'': "We are now told that a misconstruction of the patent law by a licensor is so violent and flagrant a flouting of the public interest that a court of equity must hold its hand for the benefit of a defendant whenever he chooses to invoke that interest for his private benefit, though he has failed to make the defense in an earlier litigation and stands of record an infringer." If a wrong against the public has been perpetrated, he said, let the Government sue.

Justice Frankfurter agreed with the Court's extension of the ''Carbice'' rule to cases in which "the unpatented appliance was not for common use, but was .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. adapted for the practice of the invention," but only so long as it was not shown that the item (such as the stoker switch) was not "made for the purpose, and with the intent, of their being combined by a party having no right to combine them." The doctrine of contributory infringement, thus understood, is a proper "expression both of law and morals." He then said that the majority opinion would by its unnecessary dicta embarrass litigants and lower courts "by gratuitous innuendos against a principle of the law which, within its proper bounds, is accredited by legal history as well as ethics." He also agreed with Justice Roberts that ''res judicata'' calls for affirmance.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 676-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Jackson agreed with the other dissenters about ''res judicata'' but he agreed with the majority at to contributory infringement and misuse. This patent, he said, "covers a combination—a system—a sequence—which is said to be new, although every element and factor in it is old and unpatentable. Thus, we have an abstract right in an abstruse relationship between things in which individually there is no right—a legal concept which either is very profound or almost unintelligible, I cannot be quite sure which." He recognized that "[i]f the patentee may not exclude competitors from making and vending strategic unpatented elements, such as the thermostat, adapted to use in the combination, the patented system is so vulnerable to competition as to be almost worthless. On the other hand, if he may prohibit such competition, his system patent gathers up into its monopoly devices long known to the art, and hence not themselves subject to any patent." He then referred to Justice Frankfurter's proposals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is suggested that such a patent should protect the patentee at least against one who knowingly and intentionally builds a device for use in the combination and vends it for that purpose. That is what appears to have been done here. As to ethics, the parties seem to me as much on a parity as the pot and the kettle. But want of knowledge or innocent intent is not ordinarily available to diminish patent protection. I do not see how intent can make infringement of what otherwise is not. The less legal rights depend on someone's state of mind, the better.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 679-80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The practical issue is whether we will leave such a combination patent with little value indeed, or whether we will give it value by projecting its economic effects to elements not by themselves a part of its legal monopoly. In these circumstances, I think we should protect the patent owner in the enjoyment of just what he has been granted—an abstract right in an abstruse combination—worth whatever such a totality may be worth. I see no constitutional or statutory authority for giving it additional value by bringing into its monopoly all or any of the unpatentable parts.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 680.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Concurring opinion====

Justice Black, joined by Justice Murphy, concurred specially "to add a few remarks in order that silence may not be understood as acquiescence in the views expressed in the dissenting opinion" of Justice Frankfurter. First, he said, the Court's ruling involved no dicta; what was said was necessary to resolve the case. More important, he condemned the dissent's "error of interpreting legislative enactments on the basis of a court's preconceived views on 'morals' and 'ethics.'&amp;#8202;" Nothing in the federal patent statute refers to contributory infringement. The basis of the dissent's arguments is "the writer's personal views on 'morals' and 'ethics.'&amp;#8202;":

&lt;blockquote&gt;[None of that] throws enough light on the patent statutes to justify its use in construing these statutes as creating, in addition to a right of recovery for infringement, a more expansive right judicially characterized as a "formula" of "contributory infringement." And for judges to rest their interpretation of statutes on nothing but their own conceptions of "morals" and "ethics" is, to say the least, dangerous business.

If the present case compelled consideration of the morals and ethics of contributory infringement, I should be most reluctant to conclude that the scales of moral value are weighted against the right of producers to sell their unpatented goods in a free market. At least since Adam Smith wrote, unhampered competition has not generally been considered immoral. While there have been objections to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, few if any of the objectors have questioned its morality.

It has long been recognized that a socially undesirable practice may seek acceptance under the guise of conventional moral symbols. And repeated judicial assertion that a bad practice is hallowed by morals may, if unchallenged, help it to receive the acceptance which it seeks. With this in mind, I wish to make explicit my protest against talking about the judicial doctrine of "contributory infringement" as though it were entitled to the same respect as a universally recognized moral truth.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 673-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Freeman patent===

As in the preceding case, Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. Justices Roberts, Reed, Frankfurter, and Jackson concurred in the result on the authority of ''[[Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.]]''

The Court took issue with the Seventh Circuit's basing its reversal of the district court because the combustion control switch as the heart of the invention. The Court stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that an unpatented part of a combination patent may distinguish the invention does not draw to it the privileges of a patent. That may be done only in the manner provided by law. However worthy it may be, however essential to the patent, an unpatented part of a combination patent is no more entitled to monopolistic protection than any other unpatented device. For, as we pointed out in ''Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co.'', a patent on a combination is a patent on the assembled or functioning whole, not on the separate parts. The legality of any attempt to bring unpatented goods within the protection of the patent is measured by the antitrust laws, not by the patent law.&lt;ref&gt;320 U.S. at 684.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, the "effort here made to control competition in this unpatented device plainly violates the antitrust laws," Mercoid is entitled to antitrust relief, and Honeywell "may not obtain from a court of equity any decree which directly or indirectly helps it to subvert the public policy which underlies the grant of its patent."&lt;ref&gt;''Id''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

It was said that the ''Mercoid'' cases "effectively eliminated a patent holder's ability to prevent a competitor from making and selling a component that had no use other than as part of a patented invention," and that as a result, "Congress stepped in to breathe new life into the doctrine of contributory infringement and to push back the borders of the patent misuse doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;See {{smallcaps|ABA, Intellectual Property Misuse: Licensing And Litigation}} at 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court, in ''[[Dawson Chemical Co. v. Rohm &amp; Haas Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. 176 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the legislative history of the 1952 amendment that addressed this issue in the new sections 271(c) and (d) of the patent law. Referring to the ''Mercoid'' cases, the Court said that they "definitely held that any attempt to control the market for unpatented goods would constitute patent misuse, even if those goods had no use outside a patented invention."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dawson'' Court observed that the series of decisions leading up to the
''Mercoid'' cases "involved undoing the damage thought to have been done by ''A.B. Dick''." Moreover, "The desire to extend patent protection to control of staple articles of commerce died slowly, and the ghost of the expansive contributory infringement era continued to haunt the courts."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Mercoid'' decisions left in their wake some consternation among patent lawyers and a degree of confusion in the lower courts. Although some courts treated the ''Mercoid'' pronouncements as limited in effect to the specific kind of licensing arrangement at issue in those cases, others took a much more expansive view of the decision. Among the latter group, some courts held that even the filing of an action for contributory infringement, by threatening to deter competition in unpatented materials, could supply evidence of patent misuse.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 199-200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This consternation led to lobbying efforts before Congress:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain segments of the patent bar eventually decided to ask Congress for corrective legislation that would restore some scope to the contributory infringement doctrine. With great perseverance, they advanced their proposal in three successive Congresses before it eventually was enacted in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Dawson'' Court said that the resulting amendment was a compromise. The "codification of contributory infringement and patent misuse reveals a compromise between those two doctrines and their competing policies that permits patentees to exercise control over non-staple articles used in their inventions."&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 200.&lt;/ref&gt; This undid the specific holding in the ''Mercoid'' cases,&lt;ref&gt;The Court noted that the conduct at issue in the ''Dawson'' case was "essentially the same as the method condemned in the ''Mercoid'' decisions, and the legislative history reveals that §&amp;nbsp;271(d) was designed to retreat from ''Mercoid'' in this regard." 448 U.S. at 214.&lt;/ref&gt; for:

&lt;blockquote&gt;§&amp;nbsp;271(d) effectively confer[s] upon the patentee, as a lawful adjunct of his patent rights, a limited power to exclude others from competition in nonstaple goods. A patentee may sell a nonstaple article himself while enjoining others from marketing that same good without his authorization. By doing so, he is able to eliminate competitors, and thereby to control the market for that product. Moreover, his power to demand royalties from others for the privilege of selling the nonstaple item itself implies that the patentee may control the market for the nonstaple.&lt;ref&gt;448 U.S. at 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''truth window''' (or '''truth wall'''&lt;ref&gt;Green Development: Integrating Ecology and Real Estate. 1998. Alex Wilson. p500.&lt;/ref&gt;) is an opening in a [[wall]] surface, created to reveal the layers or components within the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Good Green Homes. 2003. Jennifer Roberts. p156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solar Today. 1994. American Solar Energy Society. p21.&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[strawbale house]], a truth window is often used to show the walls are actually made from [[straw bale]]s. A small section of a wall is left [[plasterwork|unplastered]] on the interior, and a frame is used to create a window which shows only straw, which makes up the inside of the wall.&lt;ref&gt;The Good House Book. 2004. Clarke Snell. p174.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many designs exist for truth windows. Glass may be placed over the window, or an openable wooden panel, or it may be a simple framed opening.

The possible vulnerability of a truth window to moisture intrusion is sometimes raised as a concern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiolink.edu/etd/view.cgi?acc_num=ohiou1125775864 Straw-bale as a viable, cost effective, and sustainable material for use in southeast Ohio]. 2005.

'''Underfloor air distribution''' (UFAD) is an air distribution strategy for providing [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and space conditioning in [[building]]s as part of the design of a [[HVAC]] system. UFAD systems use an underfloor supply [[plenum chamber|plenum]] located between the structural concrete slab and a [[raised floor]] system to supply conditioned air through floor [[Diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffusers]] directly into the occupied zone of the building. UFAD systems are similar to conventional overhead systems (OH) in terms of the types of equipment used at the cooling and heating plants and primary [[ Air handler|air-handling units (AHU)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bauman |first1=Fred S. |last2=Daly |first2=Allan |title=Underfloor Air Distribution (UFAD) Design Guide |date=2003 |publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers |isbn=1-931862-21-4 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/underfloor-air-distribution-ufad-design-guide/oclc/54615153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key differences include the use of an underfloor air supply plenum, warmer supply air temperatures, localized air distribution (with or without individual control) and thermal stratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bauman |first1=Fred |last2=Webster |first2=T. |title=Outlook for underfloor air distribution |journal=ASHRAE Journal |date=2001 |volume=43 |issue=6 |page=18-27 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5v60x57q}}&lt;/ref&gt;Thermal stratification is one of the featured characteristics of UFAD systems, which allows higher thermostat setpoints compared to the traditional overhead systems (OH). UFAD [[cooling load]] profile is different from a traditional OH system due to the impact of [[raised floor]], particularly UFAD may have a higher peak cooling load than that of OH systems. This is because heat is gained from building penetrations and gaps within the structure itself. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauman|first1=Fred|last2=Webster|first2=Tom|last3=Jin|first3=Hui|title=Design guidelines for underfloor plenums|journal=Heating/Piping/Air Conditioning Engineering|date=2006|volume=78|pages=28–30, 32–34|url=http://www.hpac.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{See also|Glossary of HVAC}} UFAD has several potential advantages over traditional overhead systems, including  layout flexibility, improved [[thermal comfort]] and ventilation efficiency &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Faulkner |first1=David |last2=Fisk |first2=William J. |last3=Sullivan |first3=Douglas P. |title=Indoor airflow and pollutant removal in a room with floor-based task ventilation: Results of additional experiments |journal=Building and Environment |date=1995 |volume=30 |issue=3 |page=323-332 |doi=10.1016/0360-1323(94)00051-S |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036013239400051S#!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, reduced energy use in suitable climates and life-cycle costs. UFAD is often used in [[office building]]s, particularly highly-reconfigurable and open plan offices where [[raised floor]]s are desirable for cable management.

Careful considerations need to be made in the construction phase of UFAD systems to ensure a well-sealed plenum to avoid air leakage in UFAD supply plenums.

==System description==
UFAD systems rely on [[Air handler|air handling units]] to filter and condition air to the appropriate supply conditions so it can be delivered to the occupied zone. While overhead systems typically use [[Duct (HVAC)|duct]]s to distribute the air, UFAD systems use the underfloor plenum formed by installation of a [[raised floor]]. The plenum generally sits {{convert|0.3|and|0.46|m|in|lk=on}} above the structural concrete slab, although lower heights are possible.&lt;ref name="Hanzawa"&gt;{{Citation

Other approaches may incorporate fan powered [[Duct (HVAC)#Terminal units|terminal units]] at the outlets, underfloor ducts, desktop vents or connections to [[Personal Environmental Control Systems]].&lt;ref name="design guide"/&gt;

==UFAD air distribution and stratification==
Thermal stratification is the result of processes which layer the internal air in accordance with relative density. The resulting air stratum is a vertical gradient with high-density and cooler air below and low-density and warmer air above.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;{{Citation | last =Nielsen | first =P. V. | title =Displacement Ventilation – Theory and Design | volume =U9513 | year =1996 | issn =0902-8005 | publisher =Department of Building Technology and Structural Engineering, Aalborg University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the naturally convective movement of air, stratification is used predominantly in cooling conditions.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;

[[File:UFAD Air Stratification Example Diagram.jpg|thumb|Air stratification capitalizes on thermal buoyancy to layer high quality supply air at occupant level and leave unoccupied air unconditioned.]]
UFAD systems capitalize on the natural stratification that occurs when warm air rises due to [[Stack effect|thermal buoyancy]].  In a UFAD design, conditioned air stays in the lower, occupied part of the room, while heat sources such as occupants and equipment generate [[Plume (hydrodynamics)#Heat|thermal plumes]], which carry the warm air and heat source generated pollutants towards the [[ceiling]] where they are exhausted through the return air ducts.&lt;ref name="design guide"/&gt; The temperature stratification created by the UFAD system has implication for space setpoints. Most of an occupant's body is in an area that is colder than the temperature at the thermostat height; therefore, current practice recommends raising thermostat setpoints compared to traditional overhead systems. The optimal ventilation strategy controls the supply outlets to limit the mixing of supply air with room air to just below the breathing height of the space. Above this height, stratified and more polluted air is allowed to occur. The air that the occupant breathes will have a lower concentration of contaminants compared to conventional uniformly mixed systems.&lt;ref name="design guide" /&gt;

The theoretical behavior of UFAD systems is based on the plume theory for [[Displacement ventilation|DV systems]]. In comparison to classic displacement ventilation (DV) systems &lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt; that deliver air at low velocities, typical UFAD systems deliver air through floor diffusers with higher supply air velocities. In addition to increasing the amount of mixing (and therefore potentially diminishing the ventilation performance compared to DV systems), these more powerful supply air conditions can have significant impacts on room air stratification and thermal comfort in the occupied zone. Therefore, the control and optimization of this stratification is crucial to system design and sizing, energy-efficient operation, and comfort performance of UFAD systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Webster |first1=T. |last2=Bauman |first2=Fred |last3=Reese |first3=J. |title=Underfloor air distribution: thermal stratification |journal=ASHRAE Journal |date=2002 |volume=44 |issue=5 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9145t9gz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many factors, including the ceiling height, diffuser characteristics, number of diffusers, supply air temperature, total flow rate, cooling load and conditioning mode affect the ventilation efficiency of UFAD systems.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{Citation

==Application Characteristics==

===UFAD cooling load===
[[File:CoolingLoadUFADvsOH.png|thumb|350px|Schematic flow diagram of calculation procedure showing transformation from cooling load calculated for an overhead mixing system into a UFAD cooling load, and then divided between the supply plenum, zone (room), and return plenum.]]
Cooling load profiles for UFAD systems and overhead systems are different,&lt;ref name="Simplified calculation method for design cooling loads in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schiavon|first=Stefano|author2=Lee, Kwang Ho |author3=Bauman, Fred |author4=Webster, Tom |title=Simplified calculation method for design cooling loads in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems|journal=Energy and Buildings|date=February–March 2011|volume=43|issue=2–3|pages=517–528|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.017|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/5w53c7kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly due to the thermal storage effect of the lighter-weight raised floor panels compared to the heavier mass of a structural floor slab. The mere presence of the raised floor reduces the ability of the slab to store heat, thereby producing for the system with a raised floor higher peak cooling loads compared to the system without a raised floor. In the OH system, particularly in perimeter zones, part of the incoming solar heat gain is stored in the floor slab during the day, thus reducing peak zone cooling loads, and released at night when the system is off. In a UFAD system, the presence of the raised flooring transforms the solar absorbing massive floor slab into a lighter weight material, leading to relatively higher peak zone cooling loads.&lt;ref name="UFAD Guide 2013"/&gt; A modeling study based on EnergyPlus simulations showed that, generally, UFAD has a peak cooling load 19% higher than an overhead cooling load and 22% and 37% of the total zone UFAD cooling load goes to the supply plenum in the perimeter and interior, respectively.&lt;ref name="SchiavonUFADdesigntool"&gt;{{Citation

Center for the Built Environment developed a new index UFAD cooling load ratio (UCLR), which is defined by the ratio of the peak cooling load calculated for UFAD to the peak cooling load calculated for a well-mixed system, to calculate the UFAD cooling load for each zone with the traditional peak cooling load of an overhead (well-mixed) system. UCLR is determined by zone type, floor level and the zone orientation. The Supply Plenum Fraction (SPF), Zone Fraction (ZF) and Return Plenum Fraction (RPF) are developed similarly to calculate the supply plenum, zone and return plenum cooling load.&lt;ref name="Simplified calculation method for design cooling loads in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems"/&gt;

===UFAD design tools for zone airflow requirements===
There are two available design tools for determining zone airflow rate requirements for UFAD system, one is developed at [[Purdue University]] as part of the [[ASHRAE]] Research Project (RP-1522).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kisup|author2=Xue, Guangqing|title=Establishment of Design Procedures to Predict Room Airflow Requirements in Partially Mixed Room Air Distribution Systems|journal=ASHRAE Research Project Report RP-1522|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other one is developed at [[Center for the Built Environment]] (CBE) at [[University of California Berkeley]].

ASHRAE Research Project (RP-1522) developed a simplified tool that predicts the vertical temperature difference between the head and ankle of occupants, the supply air flow rate for one plenum zone, number of diffusers and the air distribution effectiveness. The tool requires users to specify the zone cooling load and the fraction of the cooling load assigned to the underfloor plenum. It also requires users to input the supply air temperature either at the diffuser or at the duct but with the ratio of plenum flowrate to zonal supply flowrate. The tool allows users to select from three type of diffusers and is applicable to seven type of buildings, including office, classroom, workshop, restaurant, retail shop, conference room and auditorium.&lt;ref name="design guide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xue|first=Guangqing|author2=Lee, Kisup |author3=Jiang,Zheng |author4= Chen, Qingyan |title=Thermal environment in indoor spaces with under-floor air distribution systems: Part 2.

The CBE UFAD design tool based on extensive research is able to predict the cooling load for UFAD system with the input of the design cooling load calculated for the same building with an overhead system. It also predicts the airflow rate, room temperature stratification, and the plenum temperature gain for both interior and perimeter zones of a typical multi-story office buildings using UFAD system. The CBE tool allows the user to select from four different plenum configurations (series, reverse series, independent and common) and three floor-diffusers (swirl, square and linear bar grill). An online version of the design tool is publicly available at [http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/ufad-designtool/online.htm Center for the Built Environment].

===Plenum air temperature rise===

[[File:UfadHeatTransfer.png|thumb|350px|Heat transfer pathways in UFAD system.]]
Plenum supply air temperature rise is the increase of the conditioned air due to convective heat gain as it travels through the underfloor supply plenum from the plenum inlet to the floor diffusers.&lt;ref name="Thermal decay"/&gt; This phenomenon is also named thermal decay. Plenum air temperature rise is caused by cool supply air coming into contact with warmer than air concrete slab and raised floor. According to a modeling study, air temperature rise can be quite significant (as much as 5&amp;nbsp;°C or 9&amp;nbsp;°F) and subsequently, compared to an idealized simulated UFAD case with no air temperature rise, elevated diffuser air temperatures can lead to higher supply airflow rate and increased fan and chiller energy consumption. The same study found that air temperature rise in summer is higher than in winter and it also depends on the climate.&lt;ref name="Thermal decay"/&gt; The ground floor with a slab on grade has less temperature rise compared to middle and top floors, and an increase of the supply air temperature causes a decrease in the temperature rise. The temperature rise is not significantly affected by the perimeter zone orientation, the internal heat gain and the window-to-wall ratio.&lt;ref name="Thermal decay"/&gt; Supply plenum air temperature rise, thus, has implications on the energy saving potential of UFAD systems and their ability to meet cooling requirements with supply temperatures above those of conventional overhead systems. Current research suggests that both energy and thermal performance can be improved in UFAD systems by ducting air to perimeter zones where loads tend to be the greatest.&lt;ref name="Thermal decay"/&gt; Critics suggest however that such underfloor ducting reduces the benefit of having a low-pressure plenum space, as well as adding design and installation complications when fitting ducts between floor tile pedestals.

===Air leakage in UFAD plenums===
[[File:UfadLeakageBad.png|thumb|left|300px|UFAD leakage that does not contribute to cooling, leading to wasted increased fan energy.]]
[[File:UfadLeakageGood.png|thumb|300px|UFAD leakage into the space, contributing to cooling.]]
Leakage in UFAD supply plenums can be a major cause for inefficiency in a UFAD system. There are two types of leakage—leakage into the space and leakage into pathways that bypass the space. The first category of leakage does not result in an energy penalty because air is getting to the zone it is intended to cool. The second category of leakage increases fan energy in order to maintain a constant plenum pressure, resulting in increased energy use. Careful consideration needs to be paid in the construction phase of UFAD systems to ensure a well-sealed plenum.&lt;ref name="design guide" /&gt;

===UFAD and energy===
The energy assessment of UFAD systems is a not fully solved issue, which has led to numerous research projects within the building science and mechanical engineering community.  Proponents of UFAD point to the lower fan pressures required to deliver air in a building via the plenum as compared to through ducts. Typical plenum pressures are {{convert|25|Pa|psi|lk=on}} (0.1&amp;nbsp;inch of water column) or less.&lt;ref name="design guide" /&gt; The improvements in cooling-system efficiency inherent in operation at higher temperatures save energy, and relatively higher supply air temperatures allow longer periods of [[Economizer#HVAC|economizer]] operation.  However, an economizer strategy is highly [[climate]]-dependent and necessitates careful control of [[Humidity#Humidity in building construction|humidity]] to avoid [[condensation]].&lt;ref name="design guide"/&gt; Critics, on the other hand, cite the shortage of rigorous research and testing to account for variations in climate, system design, thermal comfort and air quality to question whether UFAD is able to deliver improved energy efficiency in practice. Limited simulation tools, the shortage of design standards and relatively scarcity of exemplar projects compound these problems.&lt;ref name=Lehrer2003&gt;{{Citation

==Applications==
Underfloor air distribution is frequently used in [[office building]]s, particularly highly-reconfigurable and open plan offices where [[raised floor]]s are desirable for cable management.  UFAD is also common in [[command center]]s, [[information technology|IT]] [[data center]]s and [[Server room]]s that have large cooling loads from electronic equipment and requirements for routing power and data cables. The [[ASHRAE]] Underfloor Air Distribution Design Guide suggests that any building considering a [[raised floor]] for cable distribution should consider UFAD.&lt;ref name="design guide"&gt;{{Citation

 | year = 2003
 | journal = ASHRAE
 | last1 = Bauman | first1 =  Fred

Specific space considerations should be taken when using UFAD systems in laboratories because of its critical room pressurization requirements and potential migration of chemicals into the access floor plenum due to spillage. UFAD systems are not recommended in some specific facilities or spaces, such as small non-residential buildings, wet spaces like restrooms and pool areas, kitchens and dining areas and gymnasiums, because UFAD may result in especially difficult or costly in design. UFAD systems may also be used with other HVAC systems, like displacement ventilation, overhead air distribution systems, radiant ceiling or chilled beam systems to get better performance.&lt;ref name = "design guide"/&gt;

==UFAD compared to other distribution systems==
{{main|Room air distribution}}

===Overhead (mixing)===
Conventional ''overhead mixing systems'' usually locate both the supply and return air ducts at the ceiling level.  Supply air is supplied at velocities higher than typically acceptable for human comfort and the air temperature may be lower, higher, or the same as desired room temperature depending on the cooling/heating load.  High-speed turbulent air jets incoming supply air mix with the room air.

A well-engineered UFAD systems have several potential advantages over traditional overhead systems, such as layout flexibility, improved thermal comfort, improved ventilation efficiency and indoor air quality, improved energy efficiency in suitable climates and reduced life cycle costs.&lt;ref name="Thermal decay"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kwang Ho|first=Lee|author2=Stefano Schiavon |author3=Fred Bauman |author4=Tom Webster |title=Thermal decay in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems: Fundamentals and influence on system performance|journal=Applied Energy|year=2012|volume=91|issue=1|pages=197–207 | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2011.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	{{cite web| url= http://cbe.berkeley.edu/underfloorair/techoverview.htm |title=UFAD Technology Overview |publisher=Center for the Built Environment |accessdate=27 Nov 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displacement ventilation===
{{main|Displacement ventilation}}
''Displacement Ventilation'' systems (DV) work on similar principals as UFAD systems.  DV systems deliver cool air into the conditioned space at or near the floor level and return air at the ceiling level.  This works by utilizing the natural [[Stack effect|buoyancy]] of warm air and the thermal plumes generated by heat sources as cooler air is delivered from lower elevations. While similar, UFAD tends to encourage more mixing within the occupied zone and provide local air supply, which enables it to increase air motion in the space and prevent the sensation of stagnant air conditions, often associated with poor air quality.  The major practical differences are that in UFAD, air is supplied at a higher velocity through smaller-size supply outlets than in DV, and the supply outlets are usually controlled by the occupants.&lt;ref name = "design guide"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3377">In [[Law of agency|agency law]], an '''undisclosed principal''' is a person who uses an agent for negotiations with a third party who has no knowledge of the identity of the agent's [[Principal (commercial law)|principal]]. Often in such situations, the agent pretends to be acting for himself or herself. As a result, the third party does not know to look to the real principal in a dispute.&lt;ref&gt;http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/undisclosed+principal&lt;/ref&gt;

Under United States law according to the [[Restatement (Third) of Agency]] §&amp;nbsp;2.06, an undisclosed principal may still be held liable to a third party who justifiably is induced to make a detrimental change in position, even if the agent lacked actual authority to act on behalf of the principal, so long as the undisclosed principal had notice of agent's conduct and that it might induce the third party to change its position, and the principal did not take reasonable steps to notify the third party of the facts. Even where an undisclosed principal has previously forbidden the agent to take some action or incur some debt, the undisclosed principal may be liable for the action or debt so long as the third party would reasonably believe the agent would have had the authority to take the action or incur the debt under the same circumstances had the principal been disclosed, i.e. so long as the transaction is in the usual course of business engaged in by the agent.

In [[English law]], the legal principle is that, where an agent acts for an undisclosed principal the position is “in much the same way as one who is disclosed”.&lt;ref&gt;G.H.L. Friedman, The Law of Agency (UK: Butterworths, 1996), p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walt Disney World==
The undisclosed principal concept often arises in the context of real estate transactions, where a buyer risks a seller being less inclined to sell land, risks a seller demanding a higher price, or risks a seller becoming a [[Holdout problem|holdout]] if the seller knows or can guess the identity of the buyer or the buyer's intended purpose for the land which would afford the land a higher value.  The purchase of the land required to build the [[Walt Disney World]] resort in [[Orange County, Florida]] was accomplished with agents working for [[Walt Disney Productions]] as their undisclosed principal.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title=Business Law and the Regulation of Business | first1=Richard | last1=Mann | first2=Barry | last2=Roberts | edition=11th | page=607 | chapter=29: Relationship with Third Parties | isbn=1133587577 | date=2013-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over eighteen months in 1964 and 1965, agents secretly working for Disney attorneys purchased 27,400 acres of Florida ranchland, swamp, scrub woods and road frontage for an average price of only R5.20 per acre ($5 million total). It is unlikely that Disney would have been able to acquire the land except at prohibitively high prices of hundreds of thousands of dollars per acre had the sellers known their buyer's identity, given the prices at which nearby land sold after Disney completed its acquisitions and publicly announced its plan. (The project could also have been delayed for years or decades as owners of crucial pieces of land [[Holdout problem|held out]] for higher offers.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2656">The [[United States]] '''War Revenue Act of 1917''' greatly increased federal [[income tax]] rates while simultaneously lowering exemptions.

The 2% bracket had previously applied to income below $20,000. That amount was lowered to $2,000. The top bracket (on income above $2 million) was raised from 15% to 67%.

The act was applicable to incomes for 1917.

== War Income Tax for Individuals ==
In addition to the Normal Tax and an Additional Tax levied against the net income of individuals in the [[Revenue Act of 1916]] a
"like normal" tax and a "like additional" tax were levied against the net income of individuals as shown in the following table.
