'''Adam kasia''' means "the hidden Adam",&lt;ref name="Lurker2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manfred Lurker|title=The Routledge Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses, Devils and Demons|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtj0wSsw1JcC&amp;pg=PA3|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-34018-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comes from [[Persian mythology|Iranian mythology]] where it means the soul of the first man.

The '''Adam Mickiewicz Institute''' ({{lang-pl|Instytut Adama Mickiewicza}}) is a government-sponsored organization funded by [[Poland]]'s [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]], and headquartered at ''ulica Mokotowska 25'' (the [[Sugar Palace]]) in [[Warsaw]].

Named after Polish [[List of national poets#Europe|national poet]] [[Adam Mickiewicz]], its goal is to promote the [[Polish language]] and [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]] abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/about-the-institute Adam Mickiewicz Institute: About us] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212025613/http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/about-the-institute |date=February 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute operates a bilingual Polish-English portal, "Culture.pl", founded in 2001.

==Activities==
Besides a large number of associated poets, essayists, writers, translators, artists; literary, music, and film critics; and curators, the Institute includes Paweł Potoroczyn (director),&lt;ref name="Potoroczyn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/structure/director.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130705192621/http://www.iam.pl/en/about-us/structure/director.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-07-05 |title=Director: Paweł Potoroczyn |publisher=Instytut Adama Mickiewicza |date=2013 |accessdate=2013-05-09 |author=IAM }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[editor-in-chief]] Weronika Kostyrko, and editors Mikołaj Gliński (literature), Filip Lech (music), Anna Legierska (theatre), Bartosz Staszczyszyn (film), and Agnieszka Sural (visual arts).&lt;ref name="O nas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.pl/o-nas | title=Culture.pl editorial board | publisher=Instytut Adama Mickiewicza | work=Culture.pl "O nas" | date=2013 | accessdate=2013-05-09 | author=Culture.pl | format=names, contact info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Ministry-of-Culture-sponsored Adam Mickiewicz Institute, there are Polish Cultural Institutes, sponsored by the [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msz.gov.pl/Instytuty,Polskie,20909.html |title=Instytuty Polskie |publisher=Msz.gov.pl |date= |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216225043/http://www.msz.gov.pl/Instytuty%2CPolskie%2C20909.html |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in over 22 major foreign cities, including [[Berlin]], [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Bucharest]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Kiev]], [[Leipzig]], [[London]], [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]], [[New York City]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Rome]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Sofia]], [[Stockholm]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Vienna]], and [[Vilnius]].

While the Adam Mickiewicz Institute frequently collaborates with the Polish Cultural Institutes, each institution is independent of the other and is sponsored by a different Polish government ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230021524/http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/instytucje/instytuty_polskie Polish Cultural Institutes around the world - arranged according to cities in an alphabetical order.] Internet Archive.

'''Adolescence''' ({{etymology|la|adolescere|to grow up}})&lt;ref name="MacmillanDictionaryforStudents"&gt;''Macmillan Dictionary for Students'' Macmillan, Pan Ltd. (1981), page 14, 456. Retrieved 2010-7-15.&lt;/ref&gt; is a transitional stage of [[Developmental biology|physical]] and [[psychological]] [[Human development (biology)|development]] that generally occurs during the period from [[puberty]] to legal adulthood ([[age of majority]]).&lt;!--NOTE: THIS DEFINITION WAS THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED on the talk page, spanning two separate discussions. It is reliably sourced and is the consensus version. Most sources state that adolescence begins at puberty and terminates at (legal) adulthood; most cultures define the end of adolescence by the beginning of legal adulthood rather than by biological adulthood or full biological adulthood. Further, at age 18, which is the age of majority in most countries, most people are at full physical development. Thus, any changes to this definition should be discussed on the talk page first.--&gt;&lt;ref name=MacmillanDictionaryforStudents/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adolescence"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adolescence|publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]''|accessdate=May 9, 2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adolescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty and adolescence|publisher=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=July 22, 2014|archivedate=April 3, 2013|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403080324/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescence is usually associated with the teenage years,&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adolescence|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|accessdate=April 7, 2012|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/adolescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lifemodel.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Theoretical Basis for the Life Model-Research And Resources On Human Development|publisher= |url=http://www.lifemodel.org/download/Model%20Building%20Appendix.pdf|accessdate= 2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psychology.sunysb"&gt;{{cite web|title=PSY 345 Lecture Notes - Ego Psychologists, Erik Erikson |publisher= |url=http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tWHzkelF?url=http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/ewaters/345/2007_erikson/2006_erikson.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-16 |accessdate=2009-08-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later.

A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, R., &amp; Wilson, S. (2004). Adolescence across place and time: Globalization and the changing pathways to adulthood. In R. Lerner and L. Steinberg Handbook of adolescent psychology. New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, John; Roker, Debi. Psychologist11. 12 (Dec 1998): 593. "Adolescence".&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country. Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered mature enough for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such privileges and responsibilities include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, marriage, and accountability for upholding the law. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.

In studying adolescent development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arnett J. J. | year = 2007 | title = Emerging Adulthood: What Is It, and What Is It Good For? | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives| volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 68–73 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-8606.2007.00016.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; adolescence can be defined biologically, as the physical transition marked by the onset of puberty and the termination of physical growth; cognitively, as changes in the ability to think abstractly and multi-dimensionally; or socially, as a period of preparation for adult roles. Major pubertal and biological changes include changes to the [[sex organ]]s, height, weight, and [[Muscle|muscle mass]], as well as major changes in brain structure and organization. [[Cognition|Cognitive]] advances encompass both increment in knowledge and in the ability to think abstractly and to reason more effectively. The study of adolescent development often involves interdisciplinary collaborations. For example, researchers in [[neuroscience]] or [[behavioral medicine|bio-behavioral health]] might focus on pubertal changes in brain structure and its effects on cognition or social relations. Sociologists interested in adolescence might focus on the acquisition of social roles (e.g., worker or romantic partner) and how this varies across cultures or social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Côté, J. E. (1996). Identity: A multidimensional analysis. In G. R. Adams, T. Gullotta &amp; R. Montemeyer (Eds.), ''Issues in Adolescent Development (Vol. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;130–180)''. New York, NY: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; [[developmental psychology|Developmental psychologists]] might focus on changes in relations with parents and peers as a function of school structure and pubertal status.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, R., &amp; Blyth, D. (1987). ''Moving into adolescence.'' New York: Aldine de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have questioned the universality of adolescence as a developmental phase, arguing that traits often considered typical of adolescents are not in fact inherent to the teenage years.

{{Main|Puberty}}
[[File:Cubes teenager.jpg|thumb|left|Upper body of a teenage boy. The structure has changed to resemble an [[adult]] form.]]
Puberty is a period of several years in which rapid physical growth and psychological changes occur, culminating in sexual maturity. The average age of onset of puberty is at 11 for girls and 12 for boys.&lt;ref name=Kail&gt;{{cite book| last = Kail | first = RV |author2=Cavanaugh JC | title = Human Development: A Lifespan View | isbn = 0495600377 | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2010|accessdate= September 11, 2014| page = 296 | edition = 5th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E-n5E7oyCgoC&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PAmf.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Teenage Growth &amp; Development: 11 to 14 Years|publisher=[[Palo Alto Medical Foundation]]|url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-11-14.html|quote=For girls, puberty begins around 10 or 11 years of age and ends around age 16. Boys enter puberty later than girls-usually around 12 years of age-and it lasts until around age 16 or 17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every person's individual timetable for puberty is influenced primarily by [[heredity]], although environmental factors, such as diet and exercise, also exert some influences.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplowitz01&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1542/peds.108.2.347 |vauthors=Kaplowitz PB, Slora EJ, Wasserman RC, Pedlow SE, Herman-Giddens ME |title=Earlier onset of puberty in girls: relation to increased body mass index and race |journal=Pediatrics |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=347–53 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11483799 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11483799}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors can also contribute to [[precocious puberty|precocious]] and [[delayed puberty]].&lt;ref name="Delayed puberty"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplowitz01/&gt;

Some of the most significant parts of pubertal development involve distinctive physiological changes in individuals' height, weight, body composition, and [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system|respiratory]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Marshal, W. (1978). Puberty. In F. Falkner &amp; J.Tanner (Eds.), ''Human growth'', Vol. 2. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are largely influenced by hormonal activity. Hormones play an organizational role, priming the body to behave in a certain way once puberty begins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sisk C. L. |author2=Foster D.L. | year = 2004 | title = The neural basis of puberty and adolescence | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = 10| pages = 1040–1047 | doi = 10.1038/nn1326 | pmid = 15452575 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an active role, referring to changes in hormones during adolescence that trigger behavioral and physical changes.&lt;ref&gt;Coe, C., Hayashi, K., &amp; Levine, S. (1988). Hormones and behavior at puberty: Activation or concatenation. In M. Gunnar &amp; W.A. Collins (Eds.), ''The Minnesota Symposia on Child Psychology'', Vol. 21, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–41. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of [[secondary sex characteristic]]s (for example, a deeper voice and larger [[adam's apple]] in boys, and development of [[breast]]s and more curved and prominent [[hips]] in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the [[pituitary gland]], which secretes a surge of [[Hormone|hormonal]] agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female [[gonads]] are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary [[chemical]]s. The testes primarily release [[testosterone]], and the ovaries predominantly dispense [[estrogen]]. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop [[gynecomastia]] due to an imbalance of [[sex hormone]]s, tissue responsiveness or [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Nydick M, Bustos J, Dale JH, Rawson RW |title=Gynecomastia in adolescent boys |journal=JAMA |volume=178 |issue= 5|pages=449–54 |date=November 1961 |pmid=14480779|doi=10.1001/jama.1961.03040440001001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major landmark of puberty for males is [[spermarche]], the first [[ejaculation]], which occurs, on average, at age 13.&lt;ref name="Jorgensen &amp; Keiding"&gt;(Jorgensen &amp; Keiding 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; For females, it is [[menarche]], the onset of menstruation, which occurs, on average, between ages 12 and 13.&lt;ref name="Tanner"&gt;(Tanner, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson SE, Dallal GE, Must A |title=Relative weight and race influence average age at menarche: results from two nationally representative surveys of US girls studied 25 years apart |journal=Pediatrics |volume=111 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=844–50 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12671122 |doi=10.1542/peds.111.4.844}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Age at menarche in Canada: results from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children &amp; Youth|publisher=BMC Public Health |year= 2010 |pmid=21110899 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-10-736 |pmc=3001737 |volume=10 |journal=BMC Public Health |page=736 |vauthors=Al-Sahab B, Ardern CI, Hamadeh MJ, Tamim H |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK menarche"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://vstudentworld.yolasite.com/resources/final_yr/gynae_obs/Hamilton%20Fairley%20Obstetrics%20and%20Gynaecology%20Lecture%20Notes%202%20Ed.pdf |title=Obstetrics and Gynaecology |first=Diana |last=Hamilton-Fairley |edition=Second|publisher=Blackwell Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of menarche is influenced by heredity, but a girl's diet and lifestyle contribute as well.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt; Regardless of genes, a girl must have a certain proportion of body fat to attain menarche.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt; Consequently, girls who have a high-fat diet and who are not physically active begin menstruating earlier, on average, than girls whose diet contains less fat and whose activities involve fat reducing exercise (e.g. ballet and gymnastics).&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplowitz01/&gt; Girls who experience malnutrition or are in societies in which children are expected to perform physical labor also begin menstruating at later ages.&lt;ref name=Tanner/&gt;

For girls, early maturation can sometimes lead to increased self-consciousness, though a typical aspect in maturing females.&lt;ref name="Pamf.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Teenage Growth &amp; Development: 15 to 17 Years|publisher=[[Palo Alto Medical Foundation]]|accessdate=2009-02-20 |url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-15-17.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090226174419/http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-15-17.html| archivedate= 26 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their bodies' developing in advance, pubescent girls can become more insecure and dependent.&lt;ref name="Pamf.org"/&gt; Consequently, girls that reach sexual maturation early are more likely than their peers to develop [[eating disorder]]s (such as [[anorexia nervosa]]). Nearly half of all American high school girls' diets are to lose weight.&lt;ref name="Pamf.org"/&gt; In addition, girls may have to deal with sexual advances from older boys before they are emotionally and mentally mature.&lt;ref&gt;(Peterson, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to having earlier sexual experiences and more unwanted pregnancies than late maturing girls, early maturing girls are more exposed to [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;(Caspi et al.1993: Lanza and Collins, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have had such experiences tend to perform not as well in school as their "inexperienced" peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Stattin &amp; Magnussion, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls have usually reached full physical development around ages 15–17,&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAmf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAMf.org"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Teenage Growth &amp; Development: 15 to 17 Years|publisher=[[Palo Alto Medical Foundation]]|url=http://www.pamf.org/teen/parents/health/growth-15-17.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while boys usually complete puberty around ages 16–17.&lt;ref name="PAmf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PAMf.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marshall17677"&gt;Marshall (1986), p. 176–7&lt;/ref&gt; Any increase in height beyond the post-pubertal age is uncommon.

[[File:Child development stages.svg|thumb|center|800px|Approximate outline of development periods in [[child development|child]] and teenager development. Adolescence is marked in red at top right.]]

===Growth spurt===
The adolescent growth spurt is a rapid increase in the individual's [[human height|height]] and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, [[thyroid hormone]]s, and [[androgens]].&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence''. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Males experience their growth spurt about two years later, on average, than females. During their peak height velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical to that of a toddler—about 4&amp;nbsp;inches (10.3&amp;nbsp;cm) a year for males and 3.5&amp;nbsp;inches (9&amp;nbsp;cm) for females.&lt;ref name="Susman, E. 2004"&gt;Susman, E., &amp; Rogol, A. (2004). Puberty and psychological development. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'', New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to changes in height, adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight (Marshall, 1978). The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one's adult body weight.&lt;ref name="Susman, E. 2004"/&gt; Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty.&lt;ref name=Garn/&gt;

The accelerated growth in different body parts happens at different times, but for all adolescents it has a fairly regular sequence. The first places to grow are the extremities—the head, hands and feet—followed by the arms and legs, then the torso and shoulders.&lt;ref name="Tanner, J. 1972"&gt;Tanner, J. (1972). Sequence, tempo, and individual variation in growth and development of boys and girls aged twelve to sixteen. In J. Kagan &amp; R. Coles (Eds.), ''Twelve to sixteen: Early adolescence'', New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; This non-uniform growth is one reason why an adolescent body may seem out of proportion.

During puberty, bones become harder and more brittle. At the conclusion of puberty, the ends of the long bones close during the process called [[epiphysis]]. There can be ethnic differences in these skeletal changes. For example, in the United States of America, bone density increases significantly more among black than white adolescents, which might account for decreased likelihood of black women developing [[osteoporosis]] and having fewer bone fractures there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gilsanz V. |author2=Roe T. |author3=Mora S. |author4=Costin G. |author5=Goodman W. | year = 1991 | title = Changes in vertebral bone density in Black girls and White girls during childhood and puberty | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 325 | issue = 23| pages = 1597–1600 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199112053252302 | pmid = 1944449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of significant physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution of fat and muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly no sex differences in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smoll F. |author2=Schutz R. | year = 1990 | title = Quantifying gender differences in physical performance: A developmental perspective | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 360–369 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.26.3.360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pubertal development also affects [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system|respiratory]] systems as an adolescents' heart and lungs increase in both size and capacity. These changes lead to increased strength and tolerance for exercise. Sex differences are apparent as males tend to develop "larger hearts and lungs, higher systolic blood pressure, a lower resting heart rate, a greater capacity for carrying oxygen to the blood, a greater power for neutralizing the chemical products of muscular exercise, higher blood hemoglobin and more red blood cells".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, A., &amp; Taylor, B. (1980). The biological approach to adolescence: Biological change and psychological adaptation. In J. Adelson (Ed.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'', pp.129. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some genetic sex differences, environmental factors play a large role in biological changes during adolescence. For example, girls tend to reduce their physical activity in preadolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goran M. | year = 1998 | title = Developmental changes in energy expenditure and physical activity in children: Evidence for a decline in physical activity in girls before puberty | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 101 | issue = 5| pages = 887–891 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1542/peds.101.5.887 | pmid = 9565420 | last2 = Gower | first2 = BA | last3 = Nagy | first3 = TR | last4 = Johnson | first4 = RK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Savage M. |author2=Scott L. | year = 1998 | title = Physical activity and rural middle school adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 245–253 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021619930697 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may receive inadequate nutrition from diets that often lack important nutrients, such as iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson R. |author2=Johnson D. |author3=Wang M. |author4=Smiciklas-Wright H. |author5=Guthrie H. | year = 1994 | title = Characterizing nutrient intakes of adolescents by sociodemographic factors | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 149–154 | doi = 10.1016/1054-139X(94)90542-8 | pmid = 8018688 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These environmental influences in turn affect female physical development.

===Reproduction-related changes===
Primary sex characteristics are those directly related to the [[sex organ]]s. In males, the first stages of puberty involve growth of the testes and scrotum, followed by growth of the penis.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, B. (1976). ''Introduction to human sexuality''. Belmont, CA: Star.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the penis develops, the [[seminal vesicle]]s, the [[prostate]], and the [[bulbourethral gland]] also enlarge and develop. The first ejaculation of seminal fluid generally occurs about one year after the beginning of accelerated penis growth, although this is often determined culturally rather than biologically, since for many boys first ejaculation occurs as a result of masturbation.&lt;ref name="Tanner, J. 1972"/&gt; Boys are generally fertile before they have an adult appearance.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2008"/&gt;

In females, changes in the primary sex characteristics involve growth of the uterus, vagina, and other aspects of the reproductive system. [[Menarche]], the beginning of menstruation, is a relatively late development which follows a long series of hormonal changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Dorn L.D., Nottelmann E.D., Sussman E.J., Inoff-Germain G., Chrousos G.P. | year = 1999 | title = Variability in hormone concentrations and self-reported menstrual histories in young adolescents: Menarche as an integral part of a developmental process | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 28 | issue = 3| pages = 283–304 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021680726753 | last5 = Cutler }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a girl is not fully fertile until several years after menarche, as regular ovulation follows menarche by about two years.&lt;ref&gt;Hafetz, E. (1976). Parameters of sexual maturity in man. In E. Hafetz (Ed.), ''Perspectives in human reproduction'', Vol. 3: ''Sexual maturity: Physiological and clinical parameters.'' Ann Arbor, MI: Ann Arbor Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike males, therefore, females usually appear physically mature before they are capable of becoming pregnant.

Changes in [[secondary sex characteristic]]s include every change that is not directly related to sexual reproduction. In males, these changes involve appearance of pubic, facial, and body hair, deepening of the voice, roughening of the skin around the upper arms and thighs, and increased development of the sweat glands. In females, secondary sex changes involve elevation of the breasts, widening of the hips, development of pubic and underarm hair, widening of the areolae, and elevation of the nipples.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The changes in secondary sex characteristics that take place during puberty are often referred to in terms of five [[Tanner scale|Tanner stages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools%5CJ-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |title=Tanner stages |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205151003/http://healthvermont.gov/family/toolkit/tools/J-1%20CARD%20Tanner%20Stages.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after the British pediatrician who devised the categorization system.

===Changes in the brain===
The human brain is not fully developed by the time a person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age.&lt;ref name="Casey, B. J. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Casey B. J. |author2=Getz S. |author3=Galvan A. | year = 2008 | title = The adolescent brain | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 62–77 | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2007.08.003 | pmid = 18688292 | pmc = 2500212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence. However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes in the folds of the brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.&lt;ref name="Casey, B. J. 2008"/&gt;

Over the course of adolescence, the amount of [[white matter]] in the brain increases linearly, while the amount of [[grey matter]] in the brain follows an inverted-U pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giedd|first1=Jay, N|title=Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Adolescent Brain|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=2004|volume=1021|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1196/annals.1308.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a process called [[synaptic pruning]], unnecessary neuronal connections in the brain are eliminated and the amount of grey matter is pared down. However, this does not mean that the brain loses functionality; rather, it becomes more efficient due to increased [[myelin]]ation (insulation of axons) and the reduction of unused pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Giedd J. N. |author2=Blumenthal J. |author3=Jeffries N. O. |author4=Castellanos F. X. |author5=Liu H. |author6=Zijdenbos A. |author7=Rapoport J. L. | year = 1999 | title = Brain development during childhood and adolescence: a longitudinal MRI study | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 10| pages = 861–863 | doi = 10.1038/13158 | pmid = 10491603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first areas of the brain to be pruned are those involving primary functions, such as motor and sensory areas. The areas of the brain involved in more complex processes lose matter later in development. These include the lateral and [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]] cortices, among other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gogtay N. |author2=Giedd J. N. |author3=Lusk L. |author4=Hayashi K. M. |author5=Greenstein D. |author6=Vaituzis A. C. |author7=Thompson P.

During adolescence, myelination and synaptic pruning in the prefrontal cortex increases, improving the efficiency of information processing, and neural connections between the prefrontal cortex and other regions of the brain are strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Segalowitz S. J. |author2=Davies P. L. | year = 2004 | title = Charting the maturation of the frontal lobe: An electrophysiological strategy | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 116–133 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-2626(03)00283-5 | pmid = 15134847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to better evaluation of risks and rewards, as well as improved control over impulses. Specifically, developments in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are important for controlling impulses and planning ahead, while development in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is important for decision making. Changes in the orbitofrontal cortex are important for evaluating rewards and risks.

Three [[neurotransmitter]]s that play important roles in adolescent brain development are [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]]. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter. During the synaptic pruning that occurs during adolescence, most of the neural connections that are pruned contain receptors for glutamate or other excitatory neurotransmitters.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger, D.R., Elvevåg, B., Giedd, J.N. (2005). The Adolescent Brain: A Work in Progress. ''The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, by early adulthood the synaptic balance in the brain is more inhibitory than excitatory.

[[Dopamine]] is associated with pleasure and attuning to the environment during decision-making. During adolescence, dopamine levels in the [[limbic system]] increase and input of dopamine to the prefrontal cortex increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spear L. P. | year = 2000 | title = The adolescent brain and age-related behavioral manifestations | url = http://faculty.weber.edu/eamsel/Classes/Child%203000/Adolescent%20Risk%20taking/Lectures/3-4%20Biological/Spear%20LV%20%20(2000).pdf| journal = Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 417–463 | doi = 10.1016/S0149-7634(00)00014-2 | pmid = 10817843 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitters and increased dopamine activity in adolescence may have implications for adolescent risk-taking and vulnerability to boredom (see [[#Cognitive development|Cognitive development]] below).

[[Serotonin]] is a neuromodulator involved in regulation of mood and behavior. Development in the limbic system plays an important role in determining rewards and punishments and processing emotional experience and social information. Changes in the levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and [[serotonin]] in the limbic system make adolescents more emotional and more responsive to rewards and stress. The corresponding increase in emotional variability also can increase adolescents' vulnerability. The effect of serotonin is not limited to the limbic system: Several serotonin receptors have their gene expression change dramatically during adolescence, particularly in the human frontal and prefrontal cortex

==Cognitive development==
Adolescence is also a time for rapid cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s916RMYHgJIC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=adolescents+rapid+%22cognitive+development%22#v=onepage&amp;q=adolescents%20rapid%20%22cognitive%20development%22&amp;f=false |title=S.R.

Biological changes in brain structure and connectivity within the brain interact with increased experience, knowledge, and changing social demands to produce rapid cognitive growth (see [[#Changes in the brain|Changes in the brain]] above). The age at which particular changes take place varies between individuals, but the changes discussed below begin at puberty or shortly after that and some skills continue to develop as the adolescent ages. The [[dual systems model]] proposes a maturational imbalance between development of the socioemotional system and cognitive control systems in the brain that contribute to impulsivity and other behaviors characteristic of adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|date=2010-04-01|title=A dual systems model of adolescent risk-taking|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.20445/abstract|journal=Developmental Psychobiology|language=en|volume=52|issue=3|pages=216–224|doi=10.1002/dev.20445|issn=1098-2302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical perspectives===
There are at least two major approaches to understanding cognitive change during adolescence. One is the [[constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist view]] of cognitive development. Based on the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], it takes a quantitative, state-theory approach, hypothesizing that adolescents' cognitive improvement is relatively sudden and drastic. The second is the [[information processing|information-processing perspective]], which derives from the study of artificial intelligence and attempts to explain cognitive development in terms of the growth of specific components of the thinking process.

===Improvements in cognitive ability===
By the time individuals have reached age 15 or so, their basic thinking abilities are comparable to those of adults. These improvements occur in five areas during adolescence:
# Attention. Improvements are seen in [[Attention#Selective attention|selective attention]], the process by which one focuses on one stimulus while tuning out another. [[Attention|Divided attention]], the ability to pay attention to two or more stimuli at the same time, also improves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Higgins A. |author2=Turnure J. | year = 1984 | title = Distractibility and concentration of attention in children's development | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 5| pages = 1799–1810 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1984.tb00422.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schiff A. |author2=Knopf I. | year = 1985 | title = The effects of task demands on attention allocation in children of different ages | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 56 | issue = 3| pages = 621–630 | doi = 10.2307/1129752 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Memory. Improvements are seen in both [[working memory]] and [[long-term memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Keating, D. (2004). Cognitive and brain development. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinberg (Eds.), ''Handbook of Adolescent Psychology'' (2nd ed.). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Processing speed. Adolescents think more quickly than children. Processing speed improves sharply between age five and middle adolescence; it then begins to level off at age 15 and does not appear to change between late adolescence and adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kali R.V. |author2=Ferrer E. | year = 2007 | title = Processing speed in childhood and adolescence: Longitudinal models for examining developmental change | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 6| pages = 1760–1770 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01088.x | pmid = 17988319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Organization. Adolescents are more aware of their thought processes and can use mnemonic devices and other strategies to think more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A. (1975). The development of memory: Knowing, knowing about knowing, and knowing how to know. In H. Reese (Ed.), ''Advances in child development and behavior'' (Vol. 10). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Metacognition]].

Studies since 2005 indicate that the brain is not fully formed until the early twenties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog-extra/the-adolescent-brain-beyond-raging-hormones|title=The adolescent brain: Beyond raging hormones - Harvard Health|first=Harvard Health|last=Publishing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothetical and abstract thinking===
Adolescents' thinking is less bound to concrete events than that of children: they can contemplate possibilities outside the realm of what currently exists. One manifestation of the adolescent's increased facility with thinking about possibilities is the improvement of skill in [[deductive reasoning]], which leads to the development of hypothetical thinking. This provides the ability to plan ahead, see the future consequences of an action and to provide alternative explanations of events. It also makes adolescents more skilled debaters, as they can reason against a friend's or parent's assumptions. Adolescents also develop a more sophisticated understanding of probability.

The appearance of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents find it easier than children to comprehend the sorts of higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate the ways in which language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and [[sarcasm]]. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Demorest A. |author2=Meyer C. |author3=Phelps E. |author4=Gardner H. |author5=Winner E. | year = 1984 | title = Words speak louder than actions: Understanding deliberately false remarks | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 1527–1534 | doi=10.2307/1130022 |jstor=1130022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.

===Metacognition===
A third gain in cognitive ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process referred to as [[metacognition]]. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased [[introspection]], [[self-consciousness]], and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents are much better able than children to understand that people do not have complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the [[imaginary audience]] and the [[personal fable]]. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rankin J.L. |author2=Lane D.J. |author3=Gibbons F.X. |author4=Gerrard M. | year = 2004 | title = Adolescent self-consciousness: longitudinal age changes and gender differences in two cohorts | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 1–21 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01401001.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to metacognition and [[abstraction|abstract thought]], perspective-taking involves a more sophisticated [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref&gt;Smetana, J., &amp; Villalobos, M. (2009). Social cognitive development in adolescence. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinber (Eds.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'' (3rd ed., Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;187–228. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents reach a stage of social perspective-taking in which they can understand how the thoughts or actions of one person can influence those of another person, even if they personally are not involved.&lt;ref&gt;Selman, R. (1980) ''The growth of interpersonal understanding: Developmental and clinical analyses''. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relativistic thinking===
Compared to children, adolescents are more likely to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience outside the family circle, they learn that rules they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chandler M | year = 1987 | title = The Othello effect: Essay on the emergence and eclipse of skeptical doubt | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 137–159 | doi=10.1159/000273174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wisdom===
[[Wisdom]], or the capacity for insight and judgment that is developed through experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pasupathi M. |author2=Staudinger U.M. |author3=Bates P.B. | year = 2001| title = Seeds of wisdom: Adolescents' knowledge and judgment about difficult life problems|url =|journal = Developmental Psychology|volume = 37|issue = 3|pages = 351–361|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.37.3.351|pmid = 11370911}}&lt;/ref&gt; increases between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five, then levels off. Thus, it is during the adolescence-adulthood transition that individuals acquire the type of wisdom that is associated with age. Wisdom is not the same as intelligence: adolescents do not improve substantially on [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] tests since their scores are relative to others in their same age group, and relative standing usually does not change—everyone matures at approximately the same rate in this way.

===Risk-taking===

Because most injuries sustained by adolescents are related to risky behavior ([[Driving under the influence|car crashes]], alcohol, unprotected sex), a great deal of research has been done on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying adolescent risk-taking.  In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish whether adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors (prevalence), whether they make risk-related decisions similarly or differently than adults (cognitive processing perspective), or whether they use the same processes but value different things and thus arrive at different conclusions.  The behavioral decision-making theory proposes that adolescents and adults both weigh the potential rewards and consequences of an action. However, research has shown that adolescents seem to give more weight to rewards, particularly social rewards, than do adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Albert D. |author2=Steinberg L. |year = 2011|title = Judgment and Decision Making in Adolescence| url =|journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence| volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 211–224 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00724.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research seems to favor the hypothesis that adolescents and adults think about risk in similar ways, but hold different values and thus come to different conclusions.  Some have argued that there may be evolutionary benefits to an increased propensity for risk-taking in adolescence.  For example, without a willingness to take risks, teenagers would not have the motivation or confidence necessary to leave their family of origin.  In addition, from a population perspective, there is an advantage to having a group of individuals willing to take more risks and try new methods, counterbalancing the more conservative elements more typical of the received knowledge held by older adults.  Risktaking may also have reproductive advantages: adolescents have a newfound priority in sexual attraction and dating, and risk-taking is required to impress potential mates. Research also indicates that baseline [[sensation seeking]] may affect risk-taking behavior throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Johnson C.A. |author2=Xiao L. |author3=Palmer P. |author4=Sun P. |author5=Want Q. |author6=Wei Y. | year = 2008 | title = Affective decision-making deficits, linked to a dysfunctional ventromedial prefrontal cortex, revealed in 10th grade Chinese adolescent binge drinkers | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 46 | issue = 2| pages = 714–726 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.012|display-authors=etal | pmid=17996909 | pmc=3498846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Miller D. |author2=Byrnes J. | year = 1997 | title = The role of contextual and personal factors in children's risk taking | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 5| pages = 814–823 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.33.5.814 | pmid = 9300214 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the potential consequences, engaging in sexual behavior is somewhat risky, particularly for adolescents. Having unprotected sex, using poor birth control methods (e.g. withdrawal), having multiple sexual partners, and poor communication are some aspects of sexual behavior that increase individual and/or social risk. Some qualities of adolescents' lives that are often correlated with [[risky sexual behavior]] include higher rates of experienced abuse, lower rates of parental support and monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Luster Tom |author2=Small Stephen A | year = 1994 | title = Factors Associated with Sexual Risk-Taking Behaviors Among Adolescents | doi = 10.2307/352873 | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 622–632 |jstor=352873 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inhibition ===
Related to their increased tendency for risk-taking, adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Jessica|last2=Kim|first2=Jee Hyun|last3=Richardson|first3=Rick|date=2010-09-01|title=Impaired Extinction Retention in Adolescent Rats: Effects of D-Cycloserine|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|volume=35|issue=10|pages=2134–2142|doi=10.1038/npp.2010.92|issn=0893-133X|pmc=3055297|pmid=20592716}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications for engaging in risky behavior such as unsafe sex or illicit drug use, as adolescents are less likely to inhibit actions that may have negative outcomes in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spear|first=Linda Patia|date=2013-02-01|title=Adolescent Neurodevelopment|journal=The Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=52|issue=2 0 2|pages=S7–13|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2012.05.006|issn=1054-139X|pmc=3982854|pmid=23332574}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jee Hyun|last2=Richardson|first2=Rick|date=2010-02-15|title=New findings on extinction of conditioned fear early in development: theoretical and clinical implications|journal=Biological Psychiatry|volume=67|issue=4|pages=297–303|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2009.09.003|issn=1873-2402|pmid=19846065}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jee Hyun|last2=Ganella|first2=Despina E|date=2015-02-01|title=A Review of Preclinical Studies to Understand Fear During Adolescence|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ap.12066/abstract|journal=Australian Psychologist|language=en|volume=50|issue=1|pages=25–31|doi=10.1111/ap.12066|issn=1742-9544}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zbukvic|first=Isabel C.|last2=Ganella|first2=Despina E.|last3=Perry|first3=Christina J.|last4=Madsen|first4=Heather B.|last5=Bye|first5=Christopher R.|last6=Lawrence|first6=Andrew J.|last7=Kim|first7=Jee Hyun|date=2016-03-05|title=Role of Dopamine 2 Receptor in Impaired Drug-Cue Extinction in Adolescent Rats|url=http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/03/05/cercor.bhw051|journal=Cerebral Cortex|language=en|pages=2895–904|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhw051|issn=1047-3211|pmid=26946126|pmc=4869820|volume=26|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological development==
[[File:G. Stanley Hall.jpg|thumb|G. Stanley Hall]]
The formal study of adolescent psychology began with the publication of [[G. Stanley Hall]]'s "Adolescence in 1904". Hall, who was the first president of the [[American Psychological Association]], viewed adolescence primarily as a time of internal turmoil and upheaval (''sturm und drang''). This understanding of [[youth]] was based on two then new ways of understanding [[human behavior]]: [[Darwinism|Darwin's evolutionary theory]] and Freud's [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic theory]].  He believed that adolescence was a representation of our human ancestors' phylogenetic shift from being primitive to being civilized. Hall's assertions stood relatively uncontested until the 1950s when psychologists such as [[Erik Erikson]] and [[Anna Freud]] started to formulate their theories about adolescence. Freud believed that the psychological disturbances associated with youth were biologically based and culturally universal while Erikson focused on the dichotomy between [[identity formation]] and role fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Lerner, R.M, &amp; Steinberg, L.D. 2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Adolescent Psychology|year=2004|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|location=Hoboken, NJ|author=Lerner, R.M |author2=Steinberg, L.D. |last-author-amp=yes|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with their different theories, these three psychologists agreed that adolescence was inherently a time of disturbance and psychological confusion. The less turbulent aspects of adolescence, such as peer relations and cultural influence, were left largely ignored until the 1980s. From the '50s until the '80s, the focus of the field was mainly on describing patterns of behavior as opposed to explaining them.&lt;ref name="Lerner, R.M, &amp; Steinberg, L.D. 2004"/&gt;

[[Jean Macfarlane]] founded the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s Institute of Human Development, formerly called the Institute of Child Welfare, in 1927.&lt;ref name=NYT19890318&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/18/obituaries/jean-macfarlane-95-psychology-professor.html |title=Jean Macfarlane, 95, Psychology Professor - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-03-18 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--will clean up reference--&gt; The Institute was instrumental in initiating studies of healthy development, in contrast to previous work that had been dominated by theories based on pathological personalities.&lt;ref name=NYT19890318 /&gt; The studies looked at human development during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], unique historical circumstances under which a generation of children grew up. The Oakland Growth Study, initiated by Harold Jones and Herbert Stolz in 1931, aimed to study the physical, intellectual, and social development of children in the Oakland area. Data collection began in 1932 and continued until 1981, allowing the researchers to gather longitudinal data on the individuals that extended past adolescence into adulthood. [[Jean Macfarlane]] launched the Berkeley Guidance Study, which examined the development of children in terms of their socioeconomic and family backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oakland Growth and Berkeley Guidance Studies of the Institute of Human Development at the University of California, Berkeley|url=http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/lifecourse/research_projects/oakland_berkeley|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912072515/http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/lifecourse/research_projects/oakland_berkeley|archivedate=2012-09-12|publisher=University of North Carolina|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies provided the background for [[Glen Elder (sociologist)|Glen Elder]] in the 1960s, to propose a [[Life course theory|life-course perspective]] of adolescent development. Elder formulated several descriptive principles of adolescent development. The principle of historical time and place states that an individual's development is shaped by the period and location in which they grow up. The principle of the importance of timing in one's life refers to the different impact that life events have on development based on when in one's life they occur. The idea of linked lives states that one's development is shaped by the interconnected network of relationships of which one is a part; and the principle of [[human agency]] asserts that one's life course is constructed via the choices and actions of an individual within the context of their historical period and social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elder|first=Glen|title=The life course as developmental theory|journal=Child Development|date=February 1998|volume=69|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1998.tb06128.x|pmid=9499552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the Society for Research on Adolescence (SRA) became the first official organization dedicated to the study of adolescent psychology. Some of the issues first addressed by this group include: the [[nature versus nurture]] debate as it pertains to adolescence; understanding the interactions between adolescents and their environment; and considering culture, social groups, and historical context when interpreting adolescent behavior.&lt;ref name="Lerner, R.M, &amp; Steinberg, L.D. 2004"/&gt;

Evolutionary biologists like [[Jeremy Griffith]] have drawn parallels between adolescent psychology and the developmental evolution of modern humans from hominid ancestors as a manifestation of [[Recapitulation theory|ontogeny recapitulating phylogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=Jeremy|title=Freedom|year=2011|isbn=978-1-74129-011-0|url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/freedom-book1-sobered-and-depressed-adolescentman/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social development==

===Identity development===

Identity development is a stage in the adolescent life cycle.&lt;ref name="Kroger, J. 1996 pp. 40-46"&gt;Kroger, J. (1996) The Balance Between Self and Other. (pp. 40-46). New York, U.S.A. [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are.&lt;ref name="Strasburger, V.C. 2014 pp. 11-19"&gt;Strasburger, V.C., Wilson B.J., Jordan, A.B. (2014) Children and Adolescents: Unique Audiences. Children, Adolescents, and the Media. (pp. 11-19). U.S.A: [[SAGE Publications]]&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are likely to cycle through a number of identities to find one that suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status.&lt;ref name="Kroger, J. 1996 pp. 40-46"/&gt; Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as [[Identity formation|identity development]], rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt; The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Strasburger, V.C. 2014 pp. 11-19"/&gt; Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991).&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt; The environment in which an adolescent grows up also plays an important role in their identity development. Studies done by the [[American Psychological Association]] have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"&gt;[[American Psychological Association]] (APA). [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-concept====
{{See also|Self-concept}}
The idea of self-concept is known as the ability of a person to have opinions and beliefs that are defined confidently, consistent and stable.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020 | volume=48 | issue=2 | title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks | journal=Journal of Adolescent Health | pages=121–127 | pmid=21257109 | date=February 2011 |vauthors=Valkenburg PM, Peter J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in adolescence, [[cognitive development]]s result in greater self-awareness, greater awareness of others and their thoughts and judgments, the ability to think about abstract, future possibilities, and the ability to consider multiple possibilities at once. As a result, adolescents experience a significant shift from the simple, concrete, and global self-descriptions typical of young children; as children they defined themselves by physical traits whereas adolescents define themselves based on their values, thoughts, and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology: the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many, these distinctions are uncomfortable, but they also appear to motivate achievement through behavior consistent with the ideal and distinct from the feared possible selves.&lt;ref name="Markus1986" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Oyserman D. |author2=Markus H. | year = 1990 | title = Possible selves and deliquency. | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 112–125 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.59.1.112 | pmid = 2213484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further distinctions in self-concept, called "differentiation," occur as the adolescent recognizes the contextual influences on their own behavior and the perceptions of others, and begin to qualify their traits when asked to describe themselves.&lt;ref name="Harter, S. 1999"&gt;Harter, S. (1999). ''The construction of the self''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiation appears fully developed by mid-adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marsh H | year = 1989 | title = Age and sex differences in multiple dimensions of self-concept: Preadolescence to earl adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 417–430 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.81.3.417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peaking in the 7th-9th grades, the [[personality traits]] adolescents use to describe themselves refer to specific contexts, and therefore may contradict one another. The recognition of inconsistent content in the self-concept is a common source of distress in these years (see [[Cognitive dissonance]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harter S. |author2=Monsour A. | year = 1992 | title = Developmental analysis of conflict caused by opposing attributes in the adolescent self-portrait | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 251–260 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.28.2.251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this distress may benefit adolescents by encouraging structural development.

====Sense of identity====
[[Egocentrism]] in adolescents forms a self-conscious desire to feel important in their peer groups and enjoy social acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R., &amp; Heth, C. (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the conflicting aspects of self-concept, identity represents a coherent sense of self stable across circumstances and including past experiences and future goals. Everyone has a self-concept, whereas [[Erik Erikson]] argued that not everyone fully achieves identity. Erikson's theory of [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of development]] includes the [[identity crisis]] in which adolescents must explore different possibilities and integrate different parts of themselves before committing to their beliefs. He described the resolution of this process as a stage of "identity achievement" but also stressed that the identity challenge "is never fully resolved once and for all at one point in time".&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 287. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents begin by defining themselves based on their [[Crowds (adolescence)|crowd membership]]. "Clothes help teens explore new identities, separate from parents, and bond with peers." Fashion has played a major role when it comes to teenagers "finding their selves"; Fashion is always evolving, which corresponds with the evolution of change in the personality of teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;"You're Wearing That?" by Stacey Schultz. U.S. News &amp; World Report Special Issue&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents attempt to define their identity by consciously styling themselves in different manners to find what best suits them. Trial and error in matching both their perceived image and the image others respond to and see, allows for the adolescent to grasp an understanding of who they are.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"&gt;{{Citation |last=Rawlins |first=W.K. |title= Friendship matters: Communication, dialectics, and life course |publisher= Aldine de Gruyter |place= New York |year= 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as fashion is evolving to influence adolescents so is the media. "Modern life takes place amidst a never-ending barrage of flesh on screens, pages, and billboards."&lt;ref&gt;"The Media Assault on Male Body Image" by Brandon Klein. Seed Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; This barrage consciously or subconsciously registers into the mind causing issues with self-image a factor that contributes to an adolescence sense of identity. Researcher James Marcia developed the current method for testing an individual's progress along these stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marcia J | year = 1966 | title = Development and validation of ego identity status | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 551–558 | doi = 10.1037/h0023281 | pmid = 5939604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marcia J | year = 1976 | title = Identity six years after: A follow-up study | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 551–558 | pmid = 5939604 | doi=10.1037/h0023281}}&lt;/ref&gt; His questions are divided into three categories: occupation, ideology, and [[interpersonal relationship]]s. Answers are scored based on extent to which the individual has explored and the degree to which he has made commitments. The result is classification of the individual into a) identity diffusion in which all children begin, b) Identity Foreclosure in which commitments are made without the exploration of alternatives, c) Moratorium, or the process of exploration, or d) Identity Achievement in which Moratorium has occurred and resulted in commitments.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 286. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research since reveals self-examination beginning early in adolescence, but identity achievement rarely occurring before age 18.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia, J. (1980). Identity in adolescence. In J. Adelson (Ed.), ''Handbook of adolescent psychology'', pp.&amp;nbsp;159–187. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The freshman year of college influences identity development significantly, but may actually prolong psychosocial moratorium by encouraging reexamination of previous commitments and further exploration of alternate possibilities without encouraging resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Montemayor, R., Brown, B., &amp; Adams, G. (1985). Changes in identity status and psychological adjustment after leaving home and entering college. Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research in Child Development, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt; For the most part, evidence has supported Erikson's stages: each correlates with the personality traits he originally predicted.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Studies also confirm the impermanence of the stages; there is no final endpoint in identity development.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 288. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environment and identity====
An adolescent's environment plays a huge role in their identity development.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"/&gt; While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, studies show that the more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"/&gt; The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case during the middle of the 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furstenberg|first=Frank F.|title=The Sociology of Adolescence and Youth in the 1990s: A Critical Commentary|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=November 2000|volume=62|issue=4|pages=896–910|doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2000.00896.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices,&lt;ref&gt;How do Young Adolescents Cope With Social Problems? An Examination of Social Goals, Coping With Friends, and Social Adjustment. ''Journal of Early Adolescence.''&lt;/ref&gt; to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development.  Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to the wrong things at that time can have a major effect on future decisions.  While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.&lt;ref name="APA on adolescent environment"/&gt;

====Sexual orientation and identity====
[[Sexual orientation]] has been defined as "an erotic inclination toward people of one or more genders, most often described as sexual or erotic attractions".&lt;ref name="Saewyc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saewyc|first=E.M.|title=Research on Adolescent Sexual Orientation: Development, Health Disparities, Stigma, and Resilience|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=256–272|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00727.x|pmid=27099454|pmc=4835230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, psychologists have sought to understand how sexual orientation develops during adolescence. Some theorists believe that there are many different possible developmental paths one could take, and that the specific path an individual follows may be determined by their sex, orientation, and when they reached the onset of puberty.&lt;ref name="Saewyc"/&gt;

In 1989, Troiden proposed a four-stage model for the development of [[homosexual]] sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Troiden|first=R. R.|title=The formation of homosexual identities|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1989|volume=17|pages=43–73|doi=10.1300/J082v17n01_02|pmid=2668403|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first stage, known as sensitization, usually starts in childhood, and is marked by the child's becoming aware of same-sex attractions. The second stage, identity confusion, tends to occur a few years later. In this stage, the youth is overwhelmed by feelings of inner turmoil regarding their sexual orientation, and begins to engage sexual experiences with same-sex partners. In the third stage of identity assumption, which usually takes place a few years after the adolescent has left home, adolescents begin to come out to their family and close friends, and assumes a self-definition as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Floyd|first=Frank J.|author2=Stein, Terry S.|title=Sexual orientation identity formation among gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths: Multiple patterns of milestone experiences|journal=Journal of Research on Adolescence|year=2002|volume=12|issue=2|pages=167–191|doi=10.1111/1532-7795.00030}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final stage, known as commitment, the young adult adopts their sexual identity as a lifestyle. Therefore, this model estimates that the process of coming out begins in childhood, and continues through the early to mid 20s. This model has been contested, and alternate ideas have been explored in recent years.

In terms of [[sexual identity]], adolescence is when most [[gay]]/[[lesbian]] and [[transgender youth|transgender]] adolescents begin to recognize and make sense of their feelings. Many adolescents may choose to [[coming out|come out]] during this period of their life once an identity has been formed; many others may go through a period of [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]] or denial, which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences.&lt;ref name="Morrow 2004 91–99"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morrow|first=Deana|title=Social work practice with gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender adolescents|journal=Families in Society|date=Jan–Mar 2004|volume=85|issue=1|pages=91–99|doi=10.1606/1044-3894.246}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one's sexual orientation occurred, on average, around age 10, but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Augelli|first=Anthony|author2=Scott Hershberger|title=Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth in community settings: Personal challenges and mental health problems|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|year=1993|volume=21|issue=4|pages=421–448|doi=10.1007/BF00942151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coming to terms with and creating a positive [[LGBT]] identity can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or [[gender identity]] are surrounded by [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else. While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment, the risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out in the midst of a heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence.&lt;ref name="Morrow 2004 91–99"/&gt;  Because of this, statistically the [[suicide rate]] amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaylife.about.com/od/gayteens/a/gaysuicide.htm |title=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Questioning Teen Suicide Statistics - Gay Teen Suicide Statistics |publisher=Gaylife.about.com |date=2012-04-09 |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Self-esteem====
The final major aspect of identity formation is [[self-esteem]]. Self-esteem is defined as one's thoughts and feelings about one's self-concept and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, M. (2003) Self-Esteem and Health: Autonomy, Self-Esteem, and Health are Linked Together". British Medical Journal (327) pp. 574-575&lt;/ref&gt; Most theories on self-esteem state that there is a grand desire, across all genders and ages, to maintain, protect and enhance their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Contrary to popular belief, there is no empirical evidence for a significant drop in self-esteem over the course of adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 270. New York, NY: [[McGraw-Hill]].&lt;/ref&gt; "Barometric self-esteem" fluctuates rapidly and can cause severe distress and anxiety, but baseline self-esteem remains highly stable across adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, M. (1986). Self-concept from middle childhood through adolescence. In J. Suls &amp; A. Greenwald (Eds.), ''Psychological perspectives on the self'', Vol. 3. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of global self-esteem scales has been questioned, and many suggest that more specific scales might reveal more about the adolescent experience.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). ''Adolescence'', 8th ed. 273. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;
Girls are most likely to enjoy high self-esteem when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority.&lt;ref&gt;"Psychology: The Science of Behaviour" 3rd Canadian Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--citation is inadequately specific e.g. author etc--&gt; As such, they are more likely to derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun &amp; Sartorius, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Osvelia Deeds, Jeannette Delgado, Miguel Diego, Tiffany Field, and Martha Pelaez (2009). "Adolescence".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===

====In general====
The relationships adolescents have with their peers, family, and members of their social sphere play a vital role in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends.&lt;ref name="Adolescent peer pressure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adolescents and Peer Pressure|publisher=sitemaker.umich.edu/[[University of Michigan]]|accessdate=November 6, 2012|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/356.darnell/peer_pressure}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of [[peer pressure]]. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. "The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,&amp;nbsp;... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barenboim|first=Carl|title=The Development of Person Perception in Childhood and Adolescence: From Behavioral Comparisons to Psychological Constructs to Psychological Comparisons|journal=Child Development|volume=52|pages=129–144|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;hid=14&amp;sid=fdbcae39-8efd-4773-976a-e26f2afc32b7%40sessionmgr13|accessdate=8 November 2012|date=1 March 1981|doi=10.2307/1129222|jstor=1129222}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development. In social comparison we use reference groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, R.B., Rosenfeld, L.B., Proctor, R.F., &amp; Winder, C. (2012). "Interplay: The Process of Interpersonal Communication, Third Canadian Edition" Oxford University Press. pp. 42-45&lt;/ref&gt; These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.

====Family====

[[File:James Collinson - The Sisters.jpg|thumb|180px|Teenage sisters]]
Adolescence marks a rapid change in one's role within a family. Young children tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence,&lt;ref&gt;Grotevant, H. (1997). Adolescent development in family contexts. In N. Eisenberg (Ed.), ''Handbook of child psychology'' (5th ed.), Vol. 3: ''Social, emotional, and personality development'', pp. 1097–1149. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship with his or her parents.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's [[right to privacy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Steinberg L|year = 2001| title = We know some things: Adolescent-parent relationships in retrospect and prospect | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi = 10.1111/1532-7795.00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/315/Conflict.html |title=Conflict - Couple Relationships, Family Relationships, Parent-child Relationships - Theory, Development, Children, and Parents - JRank Articles |publisher=Family.jrank.org |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smetana J.

Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements.&lt;ref name="Teens Today"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theantidrug.com/advice/teens-today/teens-and-technology/social-networking.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103162953/http://www.theantidrug.com/advice/teens-today/teens-and-technology/social-networking.aspx|archivedate=2012-11-03|title=Social Networking|publisher=theantidrug.com|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites in the first place and this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Neil R.|author2=Carlson C.|author3=Donald Heth|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour, 4th Canadian Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[childhood]], siblings are a source of conflict and frustration as well as a support system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lempers J, Clark-Lempers D | year = 1992 | title = Young, middle, and late adolescents; comparisons of the functional importance of five significant relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 21 | issue = 1| pages = 53–96 | doi = 10.1007/BF01536983 | pmid = 24263682 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescence may affect this relationship differently, depending on sibling gender. In same-sex sibling pairs, intimacy increases during early adolescence, then remains stable. Mixed-sex siblings pairs act differently; siblings drift apart during early adolescent years, but experience an increase in intimacy starting at middle adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kim J. |author2=McHale S.

Siblings are able to act as peers, and may increase one another's sociability and feelings of self-worth. Older siblings can give guidance to younger siblings, although the impact of this can be either positive or negative depending on the activity of the older sibling.

A potential important influence on adolescence is change of the family dynamic, specifically [[divorce]]. With the divorce rate up to about 50%,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, updated and revised from "Families and Work in Transition in 12 Countries,1980–2001," Monthly Labor Review, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. [[Child custody|Custody]] disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent.&lt;ref name="Vangelisti"&gt;{{Citation |last=Vangelisti |first=A.L. |title= Handbook of family communication |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |place=New Jersey |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can have a positive effect on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sun Y. |author2=Li Y. | year = 2009 | title = Postdivorce family stability and changes in adolescents' academic performance: A growth-curve model | url = | journal = Journal of Family Issues | volume = 30 | issue = 11| pages = 1527–1555 | doi=10.1177/0192513x09339022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory,&lt;ref name="Ziemer"/&gt; which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training.&lt;ref name="Ziemer"&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Ziemer, B.

These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cherlin Andrew J. |author2=Chase-Lansdale P.

Despite changing family roles during adolescence, the home environment and parents are still important for the behaviors and choices of adolescents.&lt;ref name="trends"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822130027/http://www.childtrends.org/Files/FamilyEnvironmentRB.pdf|title=The Family Environment and Adolescent Well-being: Exposure to Positive and Negative Family Influences|archivedate=2006-08-22|url=http://www.childtrends.org/Files/FamilyEnvironmentRB.pdf|date=June 2006|publisher=NAHIC|author1=Aufseeser, Dena|author2=Jekielek, Susan|author3=Brown, Brett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents who have a good relationship with their parents are less likely to engage in various risk behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, fighting, and/or unprotected [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name = "trends" /&gt;
In addition, parents influence the education of adolescence. A study conducted by Adalbjarnardottir and Blondal (2009) showed that adolescents at the age of 14 who identify their parents as authoritative figures are more likely to complete secondary education by the age of 22—as support and encouragement from an authoritative parent motivates the adolescence to complete schooling to avoid disappointing that parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adalbjarnardottir S. |author2=Blondal K.S. | year = 2009 | title = Parenting practices and school dropout: a longitudinal study | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 44 | issue = | page = 176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer groups are essential to social and general development.

An Examination of Social Goals, Coping With Friends, and Social Adjustment. ''[[Journal of Early Adolescence]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A three-factor structure of dealing with friends including avoidance, mastery, and nonchalance has shown that adolescents use friends as coping devices with social stresses.

Communication within peer groups allows adolescents to explore their feelings and identity as well as develop and evaluate their social skills. Peer groups offer members the opportunity to develop social skills such as empathy, sharing, and leadership. Adolescents choose peer groups based on characteristics similarly found in themselves.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; By utilizing these relationships, adolescents become more accepting of who they are becoming. Group norms and values are incorporated into an adolescent's own self-concept.&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; Through developing new communication skills and reflecting upon those of their peers, as well as self-opinions and values, an adolescent can share and express emotions and other concerns without fear of rejection or judgment. Peer groups can have positive influences on an individual, such as on academic motivation and performance. However, while peers may facilitate social development for one another they may also hinder it. Peers can have negative influences, such as encouraging experimentation with drugs, drinking, vandalism, and stealing through peer pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Ob-Ps/Peer-groups.html |title=Peer groups - children, therapy, adults, drug, people, skills, effect, women |publisher=Minddisorders.com |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susceptibility to peer pressure increases during early adolescence, peaks around age 14, and declines thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18020830|year=2007|last1=Steinberg|first1=L|last2=Monahan|first2=KC|title=Age Differences in Resistance to Peer Influence|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1531–43|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1531|pmc=2779518|journal=Developmental Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of peers hindering social development has been found in Spanish teenagers, where emotional (rather than solution-based) reactions to problems and emotional instability have been linked with physical aggression against peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Carlo G. |author2=Mestre M.

Adolescents tend to associate with "cliques" on a small scale and "crowds" on a larger scale. During early adolescence, adolescents often associate in [[Adolescent cliques|cliques]], exclusive, single-sex groups of peers with whom they are particularly close. Despite the common{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} notion that cliques are an inherently negative influence, they may help adolescents become socially acclimated and form a stronger sense of identity. Within a clique of highly athletic male-peers, for example, the clique may create a stronger sense of fidelity and competition. Cliques also have become somewhat a "collective parent", i.e. telling the adolescents what to do and not to do.&lt;ref&gt;Grier, Peter. "The Heart of a High School: Peers As Collective Parent." ''Christian Science Monitor''. 24 April 2000: n.p. ''SIRS Researcher''. Web. 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Towards late adolescence, cliques often merge into mixed-sex groups as teenagers begin romantically engaging with one another.&lt;ref name="Connolly J 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Connolly J. |author2=Craig W. |author3=Goldberg A. |author4=Pepler D. | year = 2004 | title = Mixed-gender groups, dating, and romantic relationships in early adolescence | url = | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 185–207 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402003.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These small friend groups then break down further as socialization becomes more couple-oriented. On a larger scale, adolescents often associate with ''crowds'', groups of individuals who share a common interest or activity. Often, crowd identities may be the basis for stereotyping young people, such as [[Jock (athlete)|jocks]] or [[nerd]]s. In large, multi-ethnic high schools, there are often ethnically determined crowds.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B., &amp; Mounts, N. (1989, April). "Peer groups structures in single versus multiethnic high schools". Paper presented at the biennial meetings of the Society for Research on Adolescence, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; While crowds are very influential during early and middle adolescence, they lose salience during high school as students identify more individually.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, R.W. (1979). ''Suburban youth in cultural crisis''. New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important aspect of communication is the channel used. ''Channel'', in this respect, refers to the form of communication, be it face-to-face, email, text message, phone or other. Teens are heavy users of newer forms of communication such as text message and social-networking websites such as Facebook, especially when communicating with peers.&lt;ref name="Subrahmanyam"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Subrahmanyam| first=Kaveri | last2=Greenfield| first2=Patricia|date= Spring 2008|title= Online Communication and Adolescent Relationships|journal= The Future of Children| volume=18|pages=119–146| doi=10.1353/foc.0.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents use online technology to experiment with emerging identities and to broaden their peer groups, such as increasing the amount of friends acquired on Facebook and other social media sites.&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; Some adolescents use these newer channels to enhance relationships with peers however there can be negative uses as well such as cyberbullying, as mentioned previously, and negative impacts on the family.&lt;ref name="Subrahmanyam"/&gt;

====Romance and sexual activity====
{{Main|Adolescent sexuality}}
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality in the United States}}
[[Intimate relationship|Romantic relationships]] tend to increase in prevalence throughout adolescence. By age 15, 53% of adolescents have had a romantic relationship that lasted at least one month over the course of the previous 18 months.&lt;ref name="Carver K. 2003"&gt;Carver K., Joyner K., Udry J.R. (2003). National estimates of adolescent romantic relationships. In ''Adolescent Romantic Relationships and Sexual Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practical Implications'', 291–329.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 study conducted by [[YouGov]] for [[Channel 4]], 20% of 14−17-year-olds surveyed revealed that they had their first sexual experience at 13 or under in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="sex stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/teen-sex-survey|title=Teen Sex Survey|accessdate=2008-09-11|publisher=Channel 4|year=2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080912225248/http://sexperienceuk.channel4.com/teen-sex-survey| archivedate= 12 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 American study found that those aged 15–44 reported that the average age of first sexual intercourse was 17.0 for males and 17.3 for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstrategist.com/productdetails/Sex.SamplePgs.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061120093911/http://www.newstrategist.com/productdetails/Sex.SamplePgs.pdf|archivedate=2006-11-20 |title=Seventeen Is the Average Age at First Sexual Intercourse, '&amp;#39;American Sexual Behavior'&amp;#39;, p.4-5 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical duration of relationships increases throughout the teenage years as well. This constant increase in the likelihood of a long-term relationship can be explained by [[sexual maturity|sexual maturation]] and the development of cognitive skills necessary to maintain a romantic bond (e.g. caregiving, appropriate attachment), although these skills are not strongly developed until late adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J., &amp; Land, D. (1999). Attachment in adolescence. In J. Cassidy &amp; P. Shaver (Eds.), ''Handbook of attachment theory and research.''

(2003) The role of romantic relationships in adolescent development.http://www.du.edu/psychology/relationshipcenter/publications/furman_shaffer_2003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents often date within their demographic in regards to race, ethnicity, popularity, and physical attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = V.

While most adolescents date people approximately their own age, boys typically date partners the same age or younger; girls typically date partners the same age or older.&lt;ref name="Carver K. 2003"/&gt;

Some researchers are now focusing on learning about how adolescents view their own relationships and sexuality; they want to move away from a research point of view that focuses on the problems associated with adolescent sexuality.{{why|This sounds pov, in itself without an explanation|date=April 2014}} College Professor Lucia O'Sullivan and her colleagues found that there were no significant gender differences in the relationship events adolescent boys and girls from grades 7-12 reported.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = O'Sullivan L. F., Cheng M., Brooks-Gunn J., Mantsun K. Harris | year = 2007 | title = I wanna hold your hand: The progression of social, romantic and sexual events in adolescent relationships | url = | journal = Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1363/3910007 | pmid = 17565623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most teens said they had kissed their partners, held hands with them, thought of themselves as being a couple and told people they were in a relationship. This means that private thoughts about the relationship as well as public recognition of the relationship were both important to the adolescents in the sample. Sexual events (such as sexual touching, sexual intercourse) were less common than romantic events (holding hands) and social events (being with one's partner in a group setting). The researchers state that these results are important because the results focus on the more positive aspects of adolescents and their social and romantic interactions rather than focusing on sexual behavior and its consequences.&lt;ref name="O'Sullivan" /&gt;

Adolescence marks a time of sexual maturation, which manifests in social interactions as well. While adolescents may engage in [[casual sex|casual sexual encounters]] (often referred to as hookups), most sexual experience during this period of development takes place within romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Manning W. |author2=Longmore M. |author3=Giordano P. | year = 2000 | title = The relationship context of contraceptive use at first intercourse | url = | journal = Family Planning Perspectives | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 104–110 | doi = 10.2307/2648158 | pmid = 10894255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents can use technologies and social media to seek out romantic relationships as they feel it is a safe place to try out dating and identity exploration. From these social media encounters, a further relationship may begin.&lt;ref name="Swanson"/&gt; Kissing, hand holding, and hugging signify satisfaction and commitment. Among young adolescents, "heavy" sexual activity, marked by genital stimulation, is often associated with violence, depression, and poor relationship quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Welsh D.

For older adolescents, though, sexual activity in the context of romantic relationships was actually correlated with lower levels of deviant behavior after controlling for genetic risks, as opposed to sex outside of a relationship (hook-ups)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harden K. |author2=Mendle J. | year = 2011 | title = Adolescent sexual activity and the development of delinquent behavior: The role of relationship context | url = | journal = Journal of Youth and Adolescence | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 825–838 | doi = 10.1007/s10964-010-9601-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dating abuse|Dating violence]] is fairly prevalent within adolescent relationships. When surveyed, 10-45% of adolescents reported having experienced physical violence in the context of a relationship while a quarter to a third of adolescents reported having experiencing psychological aggression. This reported aggression includes hitting, throwing things, or slaps, although most of this physical aggression does not result in a medical visit. Physical aggression in relationships tends to decline from high school through college and young adulthood. In heterosexual couples, there is no significant difference between the rates of male and female aggressors, unlike in adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern C. |author2=Oslak S. |author3=Young M. |author4=Martin S. |author5=Kupper L. | year = 2001 | title = Partner violence among adolescents in opposite-sex romantic: Findings from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 91 | issue = 10| pages = 1679–1685 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.91.10.1679 | pmid = 11574335 | pmc = 1446854 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern C. |author2=Young M. |author3=Waller M. |author4=Martin S. |author5=Kupper L. | year = 2004 | title = Prevalence of partner violence in same-sex romantic and sexual relationships in a national sample of adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 124–131 | pmid = 15261641 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2003.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Collins2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Collins W.

Adolescent girls with male partners who are older than them are at higher risk for adverse sexual health outcomes than their peers. Research suggests that the larger the partner age difference, the less relationship power the girls experience. Behavioral interventions such as developing relationship skills in identifying, preventing, and coping with controlling behaviors may be beneficial. For condom use promotion, it is important to identify decision-making patterns within relationships and increase the power of the adolescent female in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Volpe EM, Hardie T, Cerulli C, Sommers MS, Morrison-Beedy D. What's age got to do with it? Partner age difference, power, intimate partner violence, and sexual risk in urban adolescents. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2013; 28(10): 2068-2087&lt;/ref&gt; Female adolescents from minority populations are at even higher risk for [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV). Recent research findings suggest that a substantial portion of young urban females are at high risk for being victims of multiple forms of IPV. Practitioners diagnosing depression among urban minority teens should assess for both physical and non-physical forms of IPV, and early detection can help to identify youths in need of intervention and care.&lt;ref&gt;Teitelman AM, Ratcliffe SJ, McDonald CC, Brawner BM, Sullivan C. Relationships between physical and non-physical forms of intimate partner violence and depression among urban minority adolescent females.

Urban adolescent girls’ perspectives on romantic relationships: Initiation, involvement, negotiation and conflict. Issues in Mental Health Nursing, 2014; 35: 776-790&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to adult victims, adolescent victims do not readily disclose abuse, and may seek out medical care for problems not directly related to incidences of IPV. Therefore, screening should be a routine part of medical treatment for adolescents regardless of chief complaint. Many adults discount instances of IPV in adolescents or believe they do not occur because relationships at young ages are viewed as “puppy love,” however, it is crucial that adults take IPV in adolescents seriously even though often policy falls behind.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas KA, Sorenson SB, Joshi M. Police-documented incidents of intimate partner violence against young women. Journal of Women's Health, 2010; 19: 1079-1087&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary society, adolescents also face some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]]/diseases (STIs/STDs), including [[HIV/AIDS]], are not necessarily inherent to adolescence, others such as [[teenage pregnancy]] (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI.&lt;ref name="Mulrine, A 2010"&gt;Mulrine, A."Risky Business." U.S. News &amp; World Report. 27 May 2002: 42-49. SIRS Researcher. Web. 25 Oct 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents in the United States often chose "anything but intercourse" for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it reduces the risk of STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] and [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21.&lt;ref name="Mulrine, A 2010"/&gt; Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers want to address such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 [[sex education]] instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]], the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.

===Summary===
[[File:Japan08.07 Shibuya Mybestfriends.jpg|thumb|Japanese ''[[gyaru]]'' girls in Tokyo]]
There are certain characteristics of adolescent development that are more rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures. [[Culture]] has been defined as the "symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=J.V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara.|isbn=1576072053|page=807|author2=Lerner, R.M. |author3= Finkelstein, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture is learned and socially shared, and it affects all aspects of an individual's life.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 807"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=807|author2=Rosenberg, Richard M. |author3= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a [[youth culture]].&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 807"/&gt;  For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 807"/&gt; However, "culture" should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, to avoid [[ethnocentrism]], researchers must be careful not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=271|author2=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, teenagers first came to public attention during the Second World War, when there were fears of juvenile delinquency.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Tebbutt, ''Making Youth: A History of Youth in Modern Britain'' (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s, the media presented teenagers in terms of generational rebellion.  The exaggerated moral panic among politicians and the older generation was typically belied by the growth in intergenerational cooperation between parents and children. Many working-class parents, enjoying newfound economic security, eagerly took the opportunity to encourage their teens to enjoy more adventurous lives.&lt;ref&gt;Selina Todd, and Hilary Young. "Baby-Boomers to ‘Beanstalkers’ Making the Modern Teenager in Post-War Britain." ''Cultural and Social History'' 9#3 (2012): 451-467.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools were falsely portrayed as dangerous blackboard jungles under the control of rowdy kids.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Tisdall,  "Inside the ‘blackboard jungle’ male teachers and male pupils at English secondary modern schools in fact and fiction, 1950 to 1959." ''Cultural and Social History'' 12.4 (2015): 489-507.&lt;/ref&gt; The media distortions of the teens as too affluent, and as promiscuous, delinquent, counter-cultural rebels do not reflect the actual experiences of ordinary young adults, particularly young women.&lt;ref&gt;Helena Mills, "Using the personal to critique the popular: women’s memories of 1960s youth." ''Contemporary British History'' 30#4 (2016): 463-483.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomy===
The degree to which adolescents are perceived as autonomous beings varies widely by culture, as do the behaviors that represent this emerging autonomy. Psychologists have identified three main types of [[autonomy]]: emotional independence, behavioral autonomy, and cognitive autonomy.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=79|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= foreword by Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emotional autonomy is defined in terms of an adolescent's relationships with others, and often includes the development of more mature emotional connections with adults and peers.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Behavioral autonomy encompasses an adolescent's developing ability to regulate his or her own behavior, to act on personal decisions, and to self-govern. Cultural differences are especially visible in this category because it concerns issues of dating, social time with peers, and time-management decisions.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Cognitive autonomy describes the capacity for an adolescent to partake in processes of independent reasoning and decision-making without excessive reliance on social validation.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Converging influences from adolescent cognitive development, expanding social relationships, an increasingly adultlike appearance, and the acceptance of more rights and responsibilities enhance feelings of autonomy for adolescents.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Proper development of autonomy has been tied to good mental health, high self-esteem, self-motivated tendencies, positive self-concepts, and self-initiating and regulating behaviors.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 79"/&gt;  Furthermore, it has been found that adolescents' mental health is best when their feelings about autonomy match closely with those of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Juang, L., Lerner, J. McKinney, J., &amp; von Eye, A. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A questionnaire called the teen timetable has been used to measure the age at which individuals believe adolescents should be able to engage in behaviors associated with autonomy.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2011"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2011). "Adolescence," 9th ed. 292. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; This questionnaire has been used to gauge differences in cultural perceptions of adolescent autonomy, finding, for instance, that White parents and adolescents tend to expect autonomy earlier than those of Asian descent.&lt;ref name="Steinberg, L. 2011"/&gt;  It is, therefore, clear that cultural differences exist in perceptions of adolescent autonomy, and such differences have implications for the lifestyles and development of adolescents. In sub-Saharan African youth, the notions of individuality and freedom may not be useful in understanding adolescent development. Rather, African notions of childhood and adolescent development are relational and interdependent.&lt;ref name="The World's Youth"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=B. Bradford|last2=W.

===Social roles and responsibilities===
[[File:Alessandro Allori 003.jpg|thumb|180px|Portrait of a noble girl c. 1571]]
The lifestyle of an adolescent in a given culture is profoundly shaped by the roles and responsibilities he or she is expected to assume. The extent to which an adolescent is expected to share family responsibilities is one large determining factor in normative adolescent behavior. For instance, adolescents in certain cultures are expected to contribute significantly to household chores and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 115"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=115|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household chores are frequently divided into self-care tasks and family-care tasks. However, specific household responsibilities for adolescents may vary by culture, family type, and adolescent age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=116 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown that adolescent participation in family work and routines has a positive influence on the development of an adolescent's feelings of self-worth, care, and concern for others.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 115"/&gt; 	

In addition to the sharing of household chores, certain cultures expect adolescents to share in their family's financial responsibilities. According to family economic and financial education specialists, adolescents develop sound money management skills through the practices of saving and spending money, as well as through planning ahead for future economic goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=44|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences between families in the distribution of financial responsibilities or provision of [[Allowance (money)|allowance]] may reflect various social background circumstances and intrafamilial processes, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values, as well as by the business sector and market economy of a given society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|pages=44–45|editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in many developing countries it is common for children to attend fewer years of formal schooling so that, when they reach adolescence, they can begin working.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, R., &amp; Verma, S. (1999). How children and adolescents spend their time: Time budgest for locations, activities, and companionship. "American Journal of Community Psychology, 29", 565-597.&lt;/ref&gt;

While adolescence is a time frequently marked by participation in the workforce, the number of adolescents in the workforce is much lower now than in years past as a result of increased accessibility and perceived importance of formal higher education.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2005"&gt;National Research Council. (2005). "Growing up global". Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, half of all 16-year-olds in China were employed in 1980, whereas less than one fourth of this same cohort were employed in 1990.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2005"/&gt;	
 	
Furthermore, the amount of time adolescents spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations, as well as various socioeconomic factors. American teenagers spend less time in school or working and more time on leisure activities—which include playing sports, socializing, and caring for their appearance—than do adolescents in many other countries.&lt;ref name="Larson, R. 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Larson R. |author2=Verma S. | year = 1999 | title = How children and adolescents spend time across the world:Work, play, and developmental opportunities | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 125 | issue = 6| pages = 701–736 | pmid = 10589300 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.701}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences may be influenced by cultural values of education and the amount of responsibility adolescents are expected to assume in their family or community.

Time management, financial roles, and social responsibilities of adolescents are therefore closely connected with the education sector and processes of career development for adolescents, as well as to cultural norms and social expectations. In many ways, adolescents' experiences with their assumed social roles and responsibilities determine the length and quality of their initial pathway into adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=101 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief system development===
Adolescence is frequently characterized by a transformation of an adolescent's understanding of the world, the rational direction towards a life course, and the active seeking of new ideas rather than the unquestioning acceptance of adult authority.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 577"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=577 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An adolescent begins to develop a unique [[belief system]] through his or her interaction with social, familial, and cultural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|pages=577–579 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While organized religion is not necessarily a part of every adolescent's life experience, youth are still held responsible for forming a set of beliefs about themselves, the world around them, and whatever higher powers they may or may not believe in.&lt;ref name="Lerner 2001 577"/&gt; This process is often accompanied or aided by cultural traditions that intend to provide a meaningful transition to adulthood through a ceremony, ritual, confirmation, or [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Jacqueline V.|title=Adolescence in America : an encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1576072053|page=578 |editor=Rosenberg, Richard M. |editor2= Jordan Finkelstein |others= Mark L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexuality===
Many cultures define the transition into adultlike sexuality by specific biological or social milestones in an adolescent's life. For example, [[menarche]] (the first menstrual period of a female), or [[semenarche]] (the first ejaculation of a male) are frequent sexual defining points for many cultures. In addition to biological factors, an adolescent's sexual socialization is highly dependent upon whether their culture takes a restrictive or permissive attitude toward teen or premarital sexual activity. In the United States specifically, adolescents are said to have "raging hormones" that drive their sexual desires. These sexual desires are then dramatized regarding [[Adolescent sexuality|teen sex]] and seen as "a site of danger and risk; that such danger and risk is a source of profound worry among adults".&lt;ref&gt;[Fields, J. (2012). Sexuality Education in the United States: Shared Cultural Ideas across a Political Divide. Retrieved April 28, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is little to no normalization regarding teenagers having sex in the U.S., which causes conflict in how adolescents are taught about [[sex education]]. There is a constant debate about whether [[abstinence-only sex education]] or [[comprehensive sex education]] should be taught in schools and this stems back to whether or not the country it is being taught in is permissive or restrictive. Restrictive cultures overtly discourage sexual activity in unmarried adolescents or until an adolescent undergoes a formal rite of passage. These cultures may attempt to restrict sexual activity by separating males and females throughout their development, or through [[Public humiliation|public shaming]] and physical punishment when sexual activity does occur.&lt;ref name="Connolly J 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford, C. 1951"&gt;Ford, C. &amp; Beach, F. (1951). "Patterns of sexual behavior". New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; In less restrictive cultures, there is more tolerance for displays of adolescent sexuality, or of the interaction between males and females in public and private spaces. Less restrictive cultures may tolerate some aspects of adolescent sexuality, while objecting to other aspects. For instance, some cultures find teenage sexual activity acceptable but teenage pregnancy highly undesirable. Other cultures do not object to teenage sexual activity or [[teenage pregnancy]], as long as they occur after marriage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Steinberg, L. (2011). "Adolescence", 9th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In permissive societies, overt sexual behavior among unmarried teens is perceived as acceptable, and is sometimes even encouraged.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Regardless of whether a culture is restrictive or permissive, there are likely to be discrepancies in how females versus males are expected to express their sexuality. Cultures vary in how overt this double standard is—in some it is legally inscribed, while in others it is communicated through social convention.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, L., Savin- Williams, R. (2009). Adolescent Sexuality. In R. Lerner &amp; L. Steinberg (Eds.), "Handbook of adolescent psychology" (3rd ed., Vol. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;479–523). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth face much discrimination through bullying from those unlike them and may find telling others that they are gay to be a traumatic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Andy (2013). "Youth Studies", New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of sexual attitudes that a culture embraces could thus be seen to affect the beliefs, lifestyles, and societal perceptions of its adolescents.

===Legal issues, rights and privileges===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}

====General issues====
[[File:2009-04-13 Cherry Pie sign.jpg|thumb|A sign outside a [[sex shop]] reads "Must Be 18 To Enter" in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].]]
Adolescence is a period frequently marked by increased rights and privileges for individuals. While cultural variation exists for legal rights and their corresponding ages, considerable consistency is found across cultures. Furthermore, since the advent of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 (children here defined as under 18), almost every country in the world (except the U.S. and South Sudan) has legally committed to advancing an anti-discriminatory stance towards young people of all ages. This includes protecting children against unchecked [[child labor]], enrollment in the [[military]], [[prostitution]], and [[pornography]].
In many societies, those who reach a certain age (often 18, though this varies) are considered to have reached the [[age of majority]] and are legally regarded as [[adults]] who are responsible for their actions. People below this age are considered [[Minor (law)|minors]] or [[child]]ren. A person below the age of majority may gain adult rights through [[Emancipation of minors|legal emancipation]].

The [[legal working age]] in Western countries is usually 14 to 16, depending on the number of hours and type of employment under consideration. Many countries also specify a minimum [[school leaving age]], at which a person is legally allowed to leave [[compulsory education]]. This age varies greatly cross-culturally, spanning from 10 to 18, which further reflects the diverse ways formal education is viewed in cultures around the world.

In most democratic countries, a citizen is [[Voting age|eligible to vote]] at age 18. In a minority of countries, the voting age is as low as 16 (for example, [[Brazil]]), and at one time was as high as 25 in [[Uzbekistan]].

The [[age of consent]] to sexual activity varies widely between jurisdictions, ranging from 12 to 20 years, as does the [[marriageable age|age at which people are allowed to marry]].&lt;ref name="ageofconsent"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |title=Ageofconsent.com |publisher=Ageofconsent.com |accessdate=2012-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023184559/http://www.ageofconsent.com/ageofconsent.htm |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific legal ages for adolescents that also vary by culture are enlisting in the military, gambling, and the purchase of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], [[cigarette]]s or items with parental advisory labels.
It should be noted that the legal coming of age often does not correspond with the sudden realization of autonomy; many adolescents who have legally reached adult age are still dependent on their guardians or peers for emotional and financial support. Nonetheless, new legal privileges converge with shifting social expectations to usher in a phase of heightened independence or social responsibility for most legal adolescents.

====Alcohol and illicit drug use====

=====Prevalence=====
Following a steady decline, beginning in the late 1990s up through the mid-2000s, illicit drug use among adolescents has been on the rise in the U.S.  Aside from alcohol, [[marijuana]] is the most commonly indulged drug habit during adolescent years. Data collected by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] shows that between the years of 2007 and 2011, marijuana use grew from 5.7% to 7.2% among 8th grade students; among 10th grade students, from 14.2% to 17.6%; and among 12th graders, from 18.8% to 22.6%.&lt;ref name="NIDA"&gt;[http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/high-school-youth-trends], National Institute of Drug Abuse. (2012, July). "Drugfacts: High school and youth."&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional, recent years have seen a surge in popularity of [[MDMA]]; between 2010 and 2011, the use of MDMA increased from 1.4% to 2.3% among high school seniors.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt; The heightened usage of ecstasy most likely ties in at least to some degree with the rising popularity of [[Rave|rave culture]].

One significant contribution to the increase in teenage [[substance abuse]] is an increase in the availability of [[Prescription drug|prescription medication]]. With an increase in the diagnosis of behavioral and attentional disorders for students, taking pharmaceutical drugs such as Vicodin and Adderall for pleasure has become a prevalent activity among adolescents: 15.2% of high school seniors report having abused prescription drugs within the past year.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt;

Teenage alcohol drug use is currently at an all-time low.  Out of a polled body of students, 4.4% of 8th graders reported having been on at least one occasion been drunk within the previous month; for 10th graders, the number was 13.7%, and for 12th graders, 25%.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt;  More drastically, cigarette smoking has become a far less prevalent activity among American middle- and high-school students; in fact, a greater number of teens now smoke marijuana than smoke cigarettes, with one recent study showing a respective 15.2% versus 11.7% of surveyed students.&lt;ref name="NIDA" /&gt;  Recent studies have shown that male late adolescents are far more likely to smoke cigarettes rather than females. The study indicated that there was a discernible gender difference in the prevalence of smoking among the students. The finding of the study show that more males than females began smoking when they were in primary and high schools whereas most females started smoking after high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mashamba|first1=Tshilidzi|last2=Mudhovozi|first2=Pilot|last3=Sodi|first3=Tholene|title=Gender differences in cigarette smoking among college students|journal=African Journal for Physical, Health Education, Recreation and Dance|date=September 2012|pages=117–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be attributed to recent changing social and political views towards marijuana; issues such as medicinal use and legalization have tended towards painting the drug in a more positive light than historically, while cigarettes continue to be vilified due to associated health risks.

Different drug habits often relate to one another in a highly significant manner. It has been demonstrated that adolescents who drink at least to some degree may be as much as sixteen times more likely than non-drinkers to experiment with illicit drugs.&lt;ref name="Greenblatt"&gt;{{cite report |author=Greenblatt, Janet C. |author-link= |authors= |date=2000 |title= Patterns of Alcohol Use Among Adolescents and Associations with Emotional and Behavioral Problems|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.365.6700&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |publisher=Office of Applied Studies, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |page= |docket= |access-date=2018-06-29 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Social influence=====
[[File:Night Life in Cork, Ireland.jpg|thumb|Irish teenagers over 18 hanging around outside a bar. People under 18 are not allowed to drink outside the home; this is not strictly enforced in Ireland.]]
Peer acceptance and social norms gain a significantly greater hand in directing behavior at the onset of adolescence; as such, the alcohol and illegal drug habits of teens tend to be shaped largely by the substance use of friends and other classmates.  In fact, studies suggest that more significantly than actual drug norms, an individual's perception of the illicit drug use by friends and peers is highly associated with his or her own habits in substance use during both middle and high school, a relationship that increases in strength over time.&lt;ref name="Duan et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duan|first=L.|author2=Chou, C.|author3=Andreeva, V.|author4=Pentz, M.|title=Trajectories of Peer Social Influences as Long-term Predictors of Drug Use from Early Through Late Adolescence|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=July 2009|volume=38|issue=3|pages=454–465|doi=10.1007/s10964-008-9310-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas social influences on alcohol use and marijuana use tend to work directly in the short term, peer and friend norms on smoking cigarettes in middle school have a profound effect on one's own likelihood to smoke cigarettes well into high school.&lt;ref name="Duan et al" /&gt;  Perhaps the strong correlation between peer influence in middle school and cigarette smoking in high school may be explained by the addictive nature of cigarettes, which could lead many students to continue their smoking habits from middle school into late adolescence.

=====Demographic factors=====
Until mid-to-late adolescence, boys and girls show relatively little difference in drinking motives.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuntsche|first=E.|author2=Knibbe, R.|author3=Gmel, G.|author4=Engels, R.|title=Who drinks and why? A review of socio-demographic, personality, and contextual issues behind the drinking motives in young people|journal=Addictive Behaviors|year=2006|volume=31|issue=10|pages=1844–1857|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2005.12.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Distinctions between the reasons for alcohol consumption of males and females begin to emerge around ages 14–15; overall, boys tend to view drinking in a more social light than girls, who report on average a more frequent use of alcohol as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt; The latter effect appears to shift in late adolescence and onset of early adulthood (20–21 years of age); however, despite this trend, age tends to bring a greater desire to drink for pleasure rather than coping in both boys and girls.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;

Drinking habits and the motives behind them often reflect certain aspects of an individual's personality; in fact, four dimensions of the [[Big Five personality traits|Five-Factor Model]] of personality demonstrate associations with drinking motives (all but 'Openness').  Greater enhancement motives for alcohol consumption tend to reflect high levels of extraversion and sensation-seeking in individuals; such enjoyment motivation often also indicates low conscientiousness, manifesting in lowered inhibition and a greater tendency towards aggression.  On the other hand, drinking to cope with negative emotional states correlates strongly with high neuroticism and low agreeableness.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;  Alcohol use as a negative emotion control mechanism often links with many other behavioral and emotional impairments, such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;

Research has generally shown striking uniformity across different cultures in the motives behind teen alcohol use. Social engagement and personal enjoyment appear to play a fairly universal role in adolescents' decision to drink throughout separate cultural contexts.  Surveys conducted in Argentina, Hong Kong, and Canada have each indicated the most common reason for drinking among adolescents to relate to pleasure and recreation; 80% of Argentinian teens reported drinking for enjoyment, while only 7% drank to improve a bad mood.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;  The most prevalent answers among Canadian adolescents were to "get in a party mood," 18%; "because I enjoy it," 16%; and "to get drunk," 10%.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;  In Hong Kong, female participants most frequently reported drinking for social enjoyment, while males most frequently reported drinking to feel the effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name="Kuntsche et al" /&gt;

===Media===

====Body image====
[[File:Teenage girl texting.jpg|160px|thumb|Teenage girl texting]]
Much research has been conducted on the psychological ramifications of [[body image]] on adolescents. Modern day teenagers are exposed to more media on a daily basis than any generation before them. Recent studies have indicated that the average teenager watches roughly 1500 hours of television per year.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html], TV-Free America. (2007). Television and Health. In ''The Sourcebook for Teaching Science.'' Retrieved 2012, from http://www.csun.edu/science/health/docs/tv&amp;health.html.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, modern day adolescents are exposed to many representations of ideal, societal beauty. The concept of a person being unhappy with their own image or appearance has been defined as "body dissatisfaction". In teenagers, body dissatisfaction is often associated with body mass, low [[self-esteem]], and atypical eating patterns.&lt;ref name="Makinen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mäkinen | first1 = M | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Body dissatisfaction and body mass in girls and boys transitioning from early to mid-adolescence: additional role of self-esteem and eating habits | url = | journal = BMC Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 35 | doi=10.1186/1471-244x-12-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars continue to debate the effects of media on body dissatisfaction in teens.&lt;ref name="Ata"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ata | first1 = R.

====Media profusion====

Because exposure to media has increased over the past decade, adolescents' utilization of computers, cell phones, stereos and televisions to gain access to various mediums of [[popular culture]] has also increased. Almost all American households have at least one television, more than three-quarters of all adolescents' homes have access to the Internet, and more than 90% of American adolescents use the Internet at least occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|title=Teens and social media|journal=Pew Internet and American Life Project|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the amount of time adolescents spend using these devices, their total media exposure is high. In the last decade, the amount of time that adolescents spend on the computer has greatly increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=M|title=Trajectories of perceived adult and peer discrimination among Black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents: patterns and psychological correlates.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=March 2006|volume=42|pages=391–396|pmid=16569162|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.2.218|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online activities with the highest rates of use among adolescents are video games (78% of adolescents), email (73%), instant messaging (68%), social networking sites (65%), news sources (63%), music (59%), and videos (57%).

====Social networking====

In the 2000s, social networking sites proliferated and a high proportion of adolescents used them: as of 2012 73% of 12–17 year olds reported having at least one social networking profile;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reich|first=Stephanie M.|author2=Kaveri Subrahmanyam |author3=Guadalupe Espinoza|title=Friending, IMing, and Hanging Out Face-to-Face: Overlap in Adolescents' Online and Offline Social Networks|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=March 2012|volume=48|issue=2|pages=356–368|doi=10.1037/a0026980|pmid=22369341}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-thirds (68%) of teens texted every day, half (51%) visited social networking sites daily, and 11% sent or received tweets at least once every day. More than a third (34%) of teens visited their main social networking site several times a day. One in four (23%) teens were "heavy" social media users, meaning they used at least two different types of social media each and every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teens are avid, daily users of social media|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/social-media-social-life/key-finding-1%3A-teens-are-avid,-daily-users-of-social-media|work=Social Media, Social Life: How Teens View Their Digital Lives|publisher=Common Sense Media|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces face-to-face communication, impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers. A 2015 review reported that "adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying, which has been consistently associated with an increased likelihood of depression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamm|first1=MP|last2=Newton|first2=AS|last3=Chisholm|first3=A|last4=Shulhan|first4=J|last5=Milne|first5=A|last6=Sundar|first6=P|last7=Ennis|first7=H|last8=Scott|first8=SD|last9=Hartling|first9=L|title=Prevalence and Effect of Cyberbullying on Children and Young People: A Scoping Review of Social Media Studies|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|date=22 June 2015|pmid=26098362|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0944|volume=169|issue=8|pages=770–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents' social functioning. Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in [[Internet café]]s seems only to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for [[Social anxiety|socially anxious]] teens, who find it easier to interact socially online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Su-Yen|author2=Fu, Yang-Chih|title=Internet use and academic achievement in early adolescence|journal=Adolescence|year=2009|volume=44|issue=176|pages=797–812|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;hid=107&amp;sid=fa31d0ca-f7e6-4ad5-b0e8-a5030d690614%40sessionmgr115&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=sih&amp;AN=47715864|accessdate=4 October 2012|pmid=20432601}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities. However, the Internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics.

===Transitions into adulthood===
{{see|Leaving the nest}}
[[File:Da Nang, Vietnam. A young Marine private waits on the beach during the Marine landing. - NARA - 532432 (restored).jpg|thumbnail|160px|A young U.S. Marine in the [[Vietnam War]], 1965]]
A broad way of defining adolescence is the transition from child-to-adulthood. According to Hogan &amp; Astone (1986), this transition can include markers such as leaving school, starting a full-time job, leaving the home of origin, getting married, and becoming a parent for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, N. (2000). "Pathways To Adulthood In Changing Societies: Variabilities and Mechanisms in Life Course Perspective"Annu. Rev. Sociol. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the time frame of this transition varies drastically by culture. In some countries, such as the United States, adolescence can last nearly a decade, but in others, the transition—often in the form of a ceremony—can last for only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2011). "Adolescence", 9th ed. 101. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of social and religious transition ceremonies that can be found in the U.S., as well as in other cultures around the world, are [[Confirmation]], [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]]s, [[Quinceañera]]s, [[Sweet sixteen (birthday)|sweet sixteens]], [[cotillion]]s, and [[débutante]] balls. In other countries, initiation ceremonies play an important role, marking the transition into adulthood or the entrance into adolescence. This transition may be accompanied by obvious physical changes, which can vary from a change in clothing to tattoos and scarification.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Furthermore, transitions into adulthood may also vary by gender, and specific rituals may be more common for males or for females. This illuminates the extent to which adolescence is, at least in part, a social construction; it takes shape differently depending on the cultural context, and may be enforced more by cultural practices or transitions than by universal chemical or biological physical changes.

==Promoting positive changes in adolescents==
At the decision-making point of their lives, youth is susceptible to drug addiction, sexual abuse, peer pressure, violent crimes and other illegal activities. Developmental Intervention Science (DIS) is a fusion of the literature of both developmental and intervention sciences. This association conducts youth interventions that mutually assist both the needs of the community as well as psychologically stranded youth by focusing on risky and inappropriate behaviors while promoting positive self-development along with self-esteem among adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;"The initiative to promote positive changes in youth". The Hindustan Times (New Delhi). 19th April, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The concept of adolescence has been criticized by experts, such as [[Robert Epstein]], who state that an undeveloped brain is not the main cause of teenagers' turmoils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drrobertepstein.com/pdf/Epstein-THE_MYTH_OF_THE_TEEN_BRAIN-Scientific_American_Mind-4-07.pdf|title=Dr. Robert Epstein: The myth of the teen brain - Psychology Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/why-its-time-to-lay-the-stereotype-of-the-teen-brain-to-rest-85888|title=Why it's time to lay the stereotype of the 'teen brain' to rest|last=Romer|first=Dan|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have criticized the concept of adolescence because it is a relatively recent phenomenon in human history created by modern society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199501/the-invention-adolescence|title=The Invention of Adolescence|magazine=Psychology Today|date=June 9, 2016|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ482132|title=On the "Invention" of Adolescence.|last=Fasick|first=Frank A.|journal=Journal of Early Adolescence|volume=14|number=1|pages=6–23|date=February 1994|doi=10.1177/0272431694014001002}} "[...] the application of technology to increase productivity, the affluence generated by it, and the related structural changes in society have contributed to the creation of adolescence in the North American urban-industrial society."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Teen_2_0.html?id=OENf1J45SS0C|title=Teen 2.0: Saving Our Children and Families from the Torment of Adolescence|last=Epstein|first=Robert|publisher=Linden Publishing|date=2010|isbn=1610351010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Demos|first1=John|last2=Demos|first2=Virginia|date=1969|title=Adolescence in Historical Perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=31|pages=632–638|doi=10.2307/349302|jstor=349302|via=|number=4}} "The idea of adolescence is today one of our most widely held and deeply imbedded assumptions about the process of human development. Indeed most of us treat it not as an idea but as a ''fact''. [...] The concept of adolescence, as generally understood and applied, did not exist before the last two decades of the nineteenth century."&lt;/ref&gt; and have been highly critical of what they view as the [[infantilization]] of young adults in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.fortroubledteens.com/the-danger-of-treating-teens-like-children.html|title=The Danger of Treating Teens Like Children|website=help.fortroubledteens.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article for ''[[Scientific American]]'', Robert Epstein and Jennifer Ong state that "American-style teen turmoil is absent in more than 100 cultures around the world, suggesting that such mayhem is not biologically inevitable. Second, the brain itself changes in response to experiences, raising the question of whether adolescent brain characteristics are the cause of teen tumult or rather the result of lifestyle and experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-teens-who-behave-reck/|title=Are the Brains of Reckless Teens More Mature Than Those of Their Prudent Peers?|author1-last=Epstein|author1-first=Robert|author2-last=Ong|author2-first=Jennifer|magazine=Scientific American|date=August 25, 2009|accessdate=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Moshman has also stated in regards to adolescence that brain research "is crucial for a full picture, but it [[Correlation does not imply causation|does not provide an ultimate explanation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-moshman/adolescents-and-their-tee_b_858360.html|title=The Teenage Brain: Debunking the 5 Biggest Myths|last=Moshman|first=David|date=2011-05-17|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics of the concept of adolescence do point at individual differences in brain growth rate, citing that some (though not all) early teens still have infantile undeveloped [[corpus callosum]]s, concluding that "the adult in *every* adolescent" is too generalizing. These people tend to support the notion that a more interconnected [[brain]] makes more precise distinctions (citing [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlov]]'s comparisons of [[conditioned reflex]]es in different species) and that there is a [[critical phenomena|non-arbitrary threshold]] at which distinctions become sufficiently precise to correct assumptions afterward as opposed to being ultimately dependent on exterior assumptions for communication. They argue that this threshold is the one at which an individual is objectively capable of speaking for himself or herself, as opposed to culturally arbitrary measures of "maturity" which often treat this ability as a sign of "immaturity" merely because it leads to questioning of authorities. These people also stress the low probability of the threshold being reached at a birthday, and instead advocate non-chronological emancipation at the threshold of afterward correction of assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paul|first=Richard W.|date=1988|title=Ethics without Indoctrination.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ373375|journal=Educational Leadership|language=en|volume=45|issue=8|pages=10–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes cite similarities between "adolescent" behavior and [[KZ syndrome]] (inmate behavior in adults in prison camps) such as aggression being explainable by oppression and "immature" financial or other risk behavior being explainable by a way out of captivity being more worth to captive people than any incremental improvement in captivity, and argue that this theory successfully predicted remaining "immature" behavior after reaching the [[age of majority]] by means of longer-term traumatization. In this context, they refer to the [[fallibility]] of official assumptions about what is good or bad for an individual, concluding that [[paternalism|paternalistic]] "rights" may harm the individual. They also argue that since it never took many years to move from one group to another to avoid inbreeding in the [[paleolithic]], [[evolutionary psychology]] is unable to account for a long period of "immature" risk behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51633820|title=The Thinker's Guide to Ethical Reasoning|last=Paul|first=Richard W.|last2=Elder|first2=Linda|publisher=Foundation for Critical Thinking|others=|year=2013|isbn=0944583172|edition=2nd|location=Dillon Beach, CA|pages=|oclc=51633820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6398">'''Biological Sciences Curriculum Study''' (BSCS) is an educational center that develops curricular materials, provides educational support, and conducts research and evaluation in the fields of science and technology.  It was formed in 1958, and became an independent [[non-profit organization]] in 1973, headquartered in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].

==History==

Soon after receiving a National Science Foundation grant in 1958, the American Institute of Biological Sciences established the base for BSCS activities at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].  Arnold Grobman, a herpetologist, served as the first director of BSCS, from 1958 until 1965.  [[Hiram Bentley Glass]], a geneticist, chaired the first Steering Committee (later the Board) from 1959 until 1965.  The BSCS leadership during its first decade of operation was mainly made up of professional biologists.  These professional biologists worked with high school educators and administrators to develop and implement new curriculum materials.

During the first Steering Committee meetings in 1959, the BSCS decided to target high school biology, mainly at the tenth-grade level, for improvement.  In the summer of 1960, the BSCS convened an intensive summer writing conference in Boulder, at which three new high school biology textbooks were developed.  The three versions were: Blue, a [[molecular biology]] approach; Green, an [[ecology]] approach; and Yellow, a [[cellular biology]] approach.  These three versions, and their corresponding newly developed laboratory exercises, were piloted at high schools around the United States during the 1960-61 school year.  The curriculum materials were then revised during the summer of 1961 based on feedback from teachers, students and professional biologists, and tested again during 1961-62.  In 1963, the three textbook versions were published commercially.

All three BSCS curriculum versions stressed key biological themes, such as science as inquiry, the complementarity of structure and function, genetic continuity and [[evolution]].  The BSCS textbooks emphasized evolution as a major scientific theory at a time when it was largely omitted from existing high school curricula, and the BSCS organization has remained committed to the teaching of evolution since its inception.

The BSCS also expanded its work beyond standard tenth-grade biology curriculum to produce educational materials for exceptional students, for teachers, and for all educational levels, from kindergarten to adult.

==Products==
To advance the teaching of science, BSCS developed a lesson structure they call the "BSCS 5E Instructional Model", standing for the different sections of a lesson.  It is important to note that it is NOT considered that these 5 sections—that this lesson—would be done in a single 50-60 minute class period.  These 5 E's include: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate.

* The five phases of the BSCS 5E Instructional Model are designed to facilitate the process of conceptual change.
The use of this model brings coherence to different teaching strategies, provides connections among educational activities, and helps science teachers make decisions about interactions with students.
Each phase of the model and a short phrase to indicate its purpose from a student perspective are:

    Engagement - students’ prior knowledge accessed and interest engaged in the phenomenon
    Exploration - students participate in an activity that facilitates conceptual change
    Explanation - students generate an explanation of the phenomenon
    Elaboration - students' understanding of the phenomenon challenged and deepened through new experiences
    Evaluation - students assess their understanding of the phenomenon

==Evolution controversy==
During the [[Cold War]], in 1957, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]] successfully launched the first Earth orbiting artificial satellite, [[Sputnik I]].  The event triggered alarm in [[United States]] by heightening fears there that the Soviet Union were achieving technological and strategic superiority.  One response to what the Americans termed the ''[[Sputnik crisis]]'' was to invest money and expertise towards a re-invigoration of the country's science and technological educational system.  It was during this period that the BSCS was engaged to develop updated high school [[biology]] textbooks.  The biology texts they developed covered [[evolution|evolutionary theory]], which was by this time overwhelmingly accepted as biology's central organizing principle.

These books became widely used in the nation's high schools, and as a consequence, the public [[creation-evolution controversy|controversy]] about the teaching of evolution in public schools re-ignited.  After a [[Epperson v. Arkansas|1968 Supreme Court decision]] nullified decades-old laws prohibiting the teaching of evolution in many places of the country, some evolution opponents turned their efforts against the public funding of evolutionary teaching, including publicly funded textbooks.  The BSCS textbooks were featured in the 1973 case ''[[Willoughby v. Stever]]'', a suit filed by an evangelical opponent of evolution who attempted, and failed, to have the evolution instruction in the textbook legally recognized as an [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]] establishment of religious secularism.  The case was dismissed as meritless, and was cited as legal precedent in other groundbreaking decisions in the American cultural battle over evolution in the schools.&lt;ref name=larson&gt;{{harvnb|Larson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Butters{{'}} Very Own Episode'''" is the fourteenth and final episode of the [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 79th episode of the series overall. "Butters' Very Own Episode" originally aired in the [[United States]] on [[Comedy Central]] on December 12, 2001. In the episode, [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] survives a murder attempt by his own mother after discovering his father's homosexual dalliances and must travel back to South Park in time for his parents' wedding anniversary at [[Bennigan's]]. Meanwhile, [[List of South Park families#Stephen and Linda Stotch|Butters' parents]] join [[John Bennett Ramsey|John]] and [[Patsy Ramsey]], [[Gary Condit]],  and [[O. J. Simpson]] in lying to the press about who murdered Butters.

The episode was written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and is rated [[TV-MA]] in the United States, except on syndicated broadcasts, where the episode is rated [[TV-14]], instead. It is notable for being the first episode to center around Butters and a parody of 1950s sitcoms, albeit in a more dark comedic route.

==Plot==
[[Butters Stotch|Butters]] expresses excitement about his parents' upcoming anniversary, which they are going to celebrate at Butters' favorite restaurant, [[Bennigan's]]. A few days before their anniversary, Mrs. Stotch asks Butters to spy on Mr. Stotch in order to find out what his gift for her will be so that her own won't fall short. While spying, Butters watches his dad enter first a gay theater and then a [[gay bathhouse]] (though Butters is too naive to understand the nature of his father's activity). Upon returning home, Butters reports to his mother about his father's whereabouts, leaving her appalled by her husband's homosexual affairs, becoming visibly distraught and unhinged. Mrs. Stotch then attempts to murder Butters by dumping her car in a river with him inside.

Hours later, Mr. Stotch enters the home to find his wife attempting to hang herself. He rushes to her side and explains that his homoerotic tendencies stem from chatting with other bi-curious and married men on the [[Internet]]. He insists he still loves her and doesn't want to lose his family over his "addiction". Mrs. Stotch then reveals to her husband to having drowned Butters. He promises that he will not let her go to jail. The next day, the Stotches confront the press about their son, stating that he was abducted by "[[Racial profiling|some Puerto Rican guy]]". Here the episode alludes to the case of [[Susan Smith]], replicating the murder method and that a black man is blamed for the act. As the media centers in on the "missing child" case, the pair are inducted into a club of infamous, highly publicized characters whose loved ones have also been "taken from them by Some Puerto Rican Guy", including [[Gary Condit]], [[O. J. Simpson]], and [[John Bennett Ramsey|John]] and [[Patsy Ramsey|Patricia Ramsey]]. The induction ritual includes the chanting of "one of us, one of us, gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble", an homage to the 1932 movie ''[[Freaks]]''. 

Butters, however, has survived his mother's attempt to kill him. He does not have an idea this was her intention and brushes it off as an accident, and sets off home, eager to get back in time to celebrate his parents' anniversary with them. First he has to do some singing and dancing at a seedy 'dance' club, and then he has to head down a very scary road. He returns home to find his parents fighting over all the lies they have told, and shocks them that he is still alive. Upon hearing what the quarrel was about, he scolds them for lying and trying to teach him to lie. 

Deciding to follow in their son's footsteps, they come clean to the media about the cover-up, revealing many unsettling facts to Butters in the process. Afterwards, Stan, Kyle and Cartman chastise Butters about his unhinged parents. Although he attempts to make light of the situation, Butters admits that he is now probably scarred for life and sometimes lying really can be for the best.

==Production==
Written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and directed by animation director [[Eric Stough]], "Butters' Very Own Episode" was rated [[TV-MA]] in the [[United States]], and originally aired on December 12, 2001 on [[Comedy Central]].
In the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone indicate they planned to make Butters the fourth group member after Kenny was written off the show, and created this episode as a prelude to his assuming a more prominent role in the series.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{Cite video | people=Parker, Trey| date=February 2005 |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season: "Butters' Very Own Episode"|format=Audio commentary |medium=DVD Disc|publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[IGN]] gave "Butters{{'}} Very Own Episode" a positive rating of 8.5, stating, "There are several classic moments in this episode, but it all works so well because of the setup."&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/990/990468p1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
At the time of the episode, public opinion held that Gary Condit had probably killed Chandra Levy and the Ramseys had probably killed their daughter JonBenét. However, [[Chandra Levy#Trial of Guandique|someone else]] was later convicted for the murder of Chandra Levy and Condit was exonerated. The Ramsey family were also [[JonBenét Ramsey#Letter from District Attorney: Ramsey family deemed innocent|deemed innocent]] by the district attorney in the case. In a 2011 interview, ''[[South Park]]'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] stated that they regretted how Condit and the Ramseys were portrayed in the episode.&lt;ref name="NTY2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/magazine/talk-trey-parker-and-matt-stone-of-south-park.html|work=The New York Times Magazine|first=Andrew|last=Goldman|title=The Fogies of 'South Park'|date=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home release==
"Butters' Very Own Episode", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''South Park: the Complete Fifth Season'', were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season DVD Review |publisher=Bullz-Eye |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Codding |first=Jamey  |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/2001/south_park_5.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was also released on the two-disc DVD collection ''A Little Box of Butters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: A Little Box of Butters DVD Review |publisher=DVDTalk |date=September 28, 2010 |last=Burchby |first=Casey |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/45537/south-park-a-little-box-of-butters/ |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian Ukrainian''' ({{Lang-uk|кана́дсько-украї́нська мо́ва|translit=kanadsko-ukrainska mova}}, {{IPA-uk|kɐˈnɑtsʲsʲko ukrɐˈjinsʲkɐ ˈmɔβɐ|}}) is a [[dialect]] of the [[Ukrainian language]] specific to the [[Ukrainian Canadian]] community descended from the first two waves of historical [[Ukrainian diaspora|Ukrainian emigration]] to [[Western Canada]].

Canadian Ukrainian was widely spoken from the beginning of Ukrainian settlement in Canada in 1892 until the mid-20th century. Because Ukrainian Canadians are largely descended from emigrants from the [[Austro-Hungarian]] provinces of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Bukovina]], where some self-identified as [[Rusyns]] or Ruthenians rather than Ukrainians proper, it is most similar to the dialects spoken in these areas, not in the [[Russian Empire]]- administered areas where Ukrainian was spoken. As such Canadian Ukrainian contains many more{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} loanwords from [[Polish language|Polish]], [[German language|German]], and [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and fewer from [[Russian language|Russian]], than does modern [[Standard language|standard]] Ukrainian, which is mostly based on the dialect spoken in central [[Ukraine]], particularly in the [[Cherkasy region|Cherkasy]], [[Poltava region|Poltava]] and [[Kiev region|Kiev]] areas.

The first two waves of immigrants (1882—1914, 1918—1939) spoke the dialects of what is now western Ukraine, but they were cut off from their co-linguists by wars and social changes, and half the globe.  [[Ukrainophone]]s in Canada were also exposed to speakers of many other languages in Canada, especially [[English language|English]].  As well, the mostly impoverished peasants were introduced to many new technologies and concepts, for which they had no words. Consequently, Canadian Ukrainian began to develop in new directions from the language in the "Old Country".

== Vocabulary ==
The vocabulary of the dialect, circa the 1920s, consisted of mostly of common Ukrainian words, dialecticisms from Western Ukraine, and Ukrainianizations of English words.  For example, concepts that were well known from the pre-emigration period continued to be called be their Ukrainian names, as in ''vuhillia'' (coal), ''kukhnia'' (kitchen), and ''oliia'' (oil).  However, for new concepts that had not existed in rural Austria-Hungary in the late 19th and early twentieth century, English words were simply adapted in Ukrainian speech, as in ''trak'' "truck", ''pamps'' "pumps", ''kesh régyster'' "cash register", or ''risít'' "receipt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317034153/http://collections.ic.gc.ca/ukrainian/dictionary.html|title=Dictionary of early Ukrainian-Canadian terms|date=17 March 2006|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Ukrainian language in Canada==
Prior to the [[First World War]] the Anglo-Canadian authorities in many areas did allow some Ukrainian-language instruction in public schools, as minority language rights had been given a degree of protection early in the history of the West, during the [[Manitoba Schools Question]].  However, during the war era [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] attitudes came to the fore and all minority language rights were revoked.  Speaking Ukrainian in school was expressly forbidden by Anglo-Canadian authorities for most of the mid-20th Century. Ukrainian would not again be spoken in Western Canadian public schools until policy of [[multiculturalism]] became official in the very late 1960s.

Economically, Ukrainian speakers in Canada tended to lag behind others because of the need for English in most fields of labour.  Ukrainians also faced ridicule and intimidation from some in the majority community for not speaking English only, particularly if they moved outside the majority ethnic-Ukrainian rural [[Bloc Settlements]]. Those migrating to other rural areas or from the countryside to nearby cities such as [[Edmonton]] and [[Winnipeg]] were often quicker to lose their language.  Ukrainian language use became associated with rural backwardness and went into relative decline, and would only increase with the introduction of a new wave of post-[[World War II]] immigrant speakers who spoke, by and large, a Modern or Standard Ukrainian, and not Canadian Ukrainian.

==Post-war demographic trends==
The interval census years 1961-1971 witnessed the first absolute decline in the number of individuals claiming Ukrainian as their mother tongue (361,496 to 309,860). The rate of decline has increased precipitously such that in 1981 there were 254,690 individuals who claimed Ukrainian as their mother tongue, while only 187,015 did so in 1991. The number of Ukrainian speakers in Canada continues to decline although less if only because of the change in the demographic structure of the Ukrainian ethnic group; the last post-war wave of immigrant native Ukrainian language speakers have largely disappeared as a significant statistical category. Consequently, in 1996, a total of 162,695 individuals claimed Ukrainian as their mother tongue, while in 2001 the number dropped, albeit at a lesser rate, to 148,085.

The data on Ukrainian home language use reveals that, in terms of routine family use, Ukrainian is marginal although there are some curious recent developments. Ukrainian home language use has been consistently declining, such that, in 1996, only 49,985 individuals identified Ukrainian as the language used routinely in the home. This however would increase to 67,665 in 2001, presumably the result of the arrival of post-independence Ukrainian immigrants and their children.

In the context of Canadian multiculturalism, the effect on Ukrainian language use of official provincial educational policies, which are much more sympathetic to the teaching of so-called 'heritage languages', is unknown. Nevertheless, Ukrainian language private schools exist across the country while Ukrainian is taught in both public and Catholic elementary and high schools as well as at several universities in Canada, notably on the Prairies.

According to the [[Canada 2001 Census]], 148,085 people in Canada claimed Ukrainian as their sole
"mother tongue". No provision however is made in the Canada Census for identifying dialects. Therefore, data on the Canadian Ukrainian dialect are unknown.

Provincially, the largest Ukrainian speaking population resides in Ontario. Ukrainophones there, however, are a small percentage of the population, while on the Prairies the percentage is much higher. Very few Ukrainian speakers are present in either Atlantic and Northern Canada.

Many elements of '''Caribbean folklore''' (the orally transmitted beliefs, myths, tales, and practices of a group of people) are African in origin, given that [[Slavery|slaves]] brought from Africa's [[West Africa|West (or Gold) Coast]] made up a large majority of those brought to the region.

==Characters==

Very popular in terms of Caribbean [[story-telling]], and a direct transfer from West Africa to the Caribbean are the Anancy Stories (Nancy Stories) told throughout the region.  [[Anansi|Ananse]] is the [[Ashanti language|Ashanti]] word for spider, and the trickster Anancy (also known as Ananci, Ananse, Anansi, Ananci Krokoko, and Brer Nancy), with his quick-witted intelligence and his knack for surviving the odds, often through trickery, is the most popular of this genre of African-Caribbean [[Folklore|folk-tale]] characters, although there are other West African influences, in folk story characters, including the hare (chief character in the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folktales) and the tortoise, which features in the stories of the [[Igbo people|Ibo]] people.

In addition to these stories, African religious figures also comprise a significant part of Caribbean folklore, many of the supernatural folklore figures possessing characteristics which are identical with those of African deities, and include:

"[[Papa Bois]]", who appears in many different forms, sometimes as a deer, or in old ragged clothes, sometimes hairy and though very old, extremely strong and muscular, with cloven hoofs and leaves growing out of his beard. As the guardian of the animals and the custodian of the trees, he is known to sound a cow's horn to warn his friends of the approach of hunters. He doesn't tolerate killing for killing's sake, and the wanton destruction of the forest.

"[[La Diablesse]]", the devil woman, is sometimes personified as an old crone, who steps forth with her cloven hoof from behind a tree on a lonely road, the sound of chains mingling with the rustle of her petticoat. Sometimes she takes the form of a beautiful woman, to lure some unsuspecting passerby to his death or perhaps to madness. Although she may appear young, she will be dressed in the ancient costume of these islands: a brilliant madras turban, chemise with half sleeves and much embroidery and lace, ''zepingue tremblant'' ("trembling pins of gold"), and all the finery of the by-gone days. Even when she appears beautiful, there is something that betrays her - she often has one hoof and a normal human foot or two hooves which she uses her long, flowing gown to hide.

"[[Mama Dlo]]" or "Mama Dglo" (known in West Africa today as [[Mami Wata|Mammy Wata]]) whose name is derived from the French "maman de l'eau" which means "mother of the water" is akin to the [[mermaid]] figure of European folklore and represents West African water spirits and there is a spirit called a cocoya who feasts on children then eats them up - they also can change into different shapes.

The "[[Soucouyant]]", whose French-derived names comes from the word "to suck", is personified by a woman, often old, who sheds her skin at night and flies through the skies, sometimes as a ball of flame, to suck blood from her victims.

The "[[Lagahoo|Ligahoo]]" or "Loup Garou" is a shape changer, a man who has power over nature and the capacity to change form to that of an animal. Or in Caribbean Myths the Loup-Garou is a man who made a deal with the devil, to have the ability to change form (to a werewolf) so that at night he could go around to kill without ever being caught.

Some contemporary Caribbean writers explore Afro-Caribbean folklore themes in their novels, including [[Nalo Hopkinson]], [[Wayne Gerard Trotman]] and [[Marie-Elena John]].

__toc__
Even if the main role of clothing is to protect from the cold, [[protective clothing]] also exists to protect from heat, such as for metallurgical workers or firemen. As regards thermal comfort, only the first case is considered.

== Mechanisms of insulation ==

There are three kinds of [[heat transfer]]: [[thermal conduction|conduction]] (exchange of heat through contact), [[convection]] (movement of fluids), and [[thermal radiation|radiation]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Air has a low [[thermal conductivity]] but is very mobile. There are thus two elements that are important in protecting from the cold{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}:

* stopping the wind from penetrating and replacing the layer of warm air close to the body;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* setting up a layer of still air which serves as insulation, by the use of [[fibre]]s ([[wool]], [[fur]], et cetera).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Another important factor is [[humidity]]. Water is a better conductor of heat than air, thus if clothes are damp — because of [[sweat]], rain, or immersion — water replaces some or all of the air between the fibres of the clothing, causing thermal loss through conduction and/or evaporation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Thermal insulation is thus optimal with three layers of clothing:
* a layer near the body for hygiene (changed more often than the other clothing), whose role is to get rid of sweat so it does not remain in contact with the skin;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* an outer close-knit or closely woven layer as a [[wind breaker]], usually thin — if there is a risk of precipitation this should be impermeable, the ideal being a textile that stops water droplets but allows water vapor to pass so as to remove evaporated sweat (a textile of this sort is said to "breathe");{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* and between the two, a "thick" layer that traps the air and prevents contact between the skin and the wind-breaking layer (which, as it is thin, gets close to the ambient temperature).{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The three layers of air between the skin and the exterior layer also play an insulating role. If the clothing is squeezed tight (as by the straps of a backpack), insulation will be poorer in those places.&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix
|link=Wikipedia:Citation needed
|text=citation needed
|class=noprint Template-Fact
|title=This claim needs references to reliable sources
}}&lt;!--{{Fact}} end--&gt;

== Units and measurement ==

Clothing insulation may be expressed in '''clo''' units.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Fundamentals"&gt;Thermal Comfort chapter, Fundamentals volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', [[ASHRAE]], Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The clo has the same [[Dimensional analysis|dimensions]] as the [[R-value (insulation)|R value]] used to describe insulation used in residential and commercial construction.  The clo value is also similar in magnitude to the R value:
: 1 clo = 0.155 [[kelvin|K]]·[[square metre|m²]]·[[watt|W⁻¹]] ≈ 0.88 R (where R means [[Foot (length)|ft]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Fahrenheit|°F]]·[[Hour|hr]]/[[British thermal unit|Btu]])
This is the amount of insulation that allows a person at rest to maintain thermal equilibrium in an environment at 21[[°C]] (70[[°F]]) in a normally ventilated room (0.1&amp;nbsp;m/s air movement).

There are a number of ways to determine clothing insulation provided by clothes, but the most accurate according to [[ASHRAE]] Fundamentals are measurements on [[Thermal manikin|heated manikins]] and on active subjects. Equations may then be used to calculate the thermal insulation.
Because clothing insulation cannot be measured for most routine engineering applications, tables of measured values for various clothing ensembles can be used.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Fundamentals" /&gt;
According to ASHRAE-55 2010 standard, there are three methods for estimating clothing insulation using the tables provided.

== Further considerations and examples ==

Other factors that influence the clothing insulation are posture and activity. Sitting or lying change the thermal insulation due to the compression of air layers in the clothing, but at the same time - depending on the materials that are made of - chairs and bedding can provide considerable insulation. While it is possible to determine the increase of insulation provided by chairs, sleeping or resting situations are more difficult to evaluate unless the individual is completely immobile.&lt;ref name="Ashrae 55 Standard"/&gt;
Body motion decreases the insulation of a clothing ensemble by pumping air through clothing openings and/or causing air motion within the clothing. This effect varies considerably depending on the nature of the motion and of the clothing. Accurate estimates of clothing insulation for an active person are therefore not available, unless measurements are made for the specific condition (e.g., with a walking manikin).
A rough estimate of the clothing insulation for an active person is:

I&lt;sub&gt;cl, active&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; ×(0.6+0.4/M)         1.2 met &lt; M &lt; 2.0 met

where M is the metabolic rate in met units and I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt; is the insulation without activity. For metabolic rates less than or equal to 1.2 met, no adjustment is recommended.&lt;ref name="Ashrae 55 Standard"/&gt;

Clothing insulation is correlated with outdoor air temperature, indoor operative temperatures, relative humidity and also by the presence of a dress code in the environment in question.
Recent studies have developed dynamic predictive clothing insulation models that allow more precise thermal comfort calculation, energy simulation, HVAC sizing and building operation than previous practice. As a matter of fact, usually simplifications are used (0.5 clo in the summer, 1.0 in the winter). This may lead to systems that are incorrectly sized and/or operated. A model that is able to predict how building occupants change their clothing would greatly improve HVAC system operation.&lt;ref name="Schiavon &amp; Lee, 2012"/&gt;

As mentioned, clothing adaptation has an important role in achieving thermal comfort and is probably the most effective adjustment that occupants can make to adapt themselves in a thermal environment. Moreover, clothing variability may also depend on factors unrelated to thermal conditions, such as for a dress code or social influences, style preferences that may differ due to gender or work position. According to ASHRAE-55 standard, only if individuals are freely making adjustments in clothing to suit their thermal preferences, it is acceptable to use a single representative average value for everyone.&lt;ref name="Ashrae 55 Standard"/&gt;

Some basic insulation values can be considered as examples of typical conditions&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022244/http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/studentdownloads/DEA3500pdfs/Thermcomfort.pdf Notes for course "Human Factors: Ambient Environment"] by Prof. Alan Hedge, [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperature of thermal equilibrium ==

The ambient temperature at which someone's body will be at thermal equilibrium depends on the rate of heat generation per unit area ''P'' and the [[thermal insulance]] of the clothing ''R''. The empirical formula is:&lt;!--{{Fact}} begin--&gt;{{fix

A '''cultural landscape''', as defined by the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage Committee]], is the "cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention [http://whc.unesco.org/archive/opguide12-en.pdf]. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

# "a [[landscape]] designed and created intentionally by man"
# an "organically evolved landscape" which may be a "[[relict]] (or fossil) landscape" or a "continuing landscape"
# an "associative cultural landscape" which may be valued because of the "religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element."

== History of the concept ==
The concept of 'cultural landscapes' can be found in the European tradition of [[landscape art|landscape painting]].&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University. Cairns, Australia. Page 62&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"&gt;GIBSON, W.S (1989) Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape in Sixteenth-Century Flemish Painting.  Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "[[landscape]]" itself combines 'land' with a verb of Germanic origin, "''scapjan/ schaffen''" to mean, literally, 'shaped lands'.&lt;ref&gt;HABER, W (1995) ''Concept, Origin, and Meaning of Landscape''. UNESCO's Cultural Landscapes of Universal Value: Components of a Global Strategy. UNESCO, New York. Pages 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lands were then considered shaped by natural forces, and the unique details of such ''landshaffen'' (shaped lands) became themselves the subject of 'landscape' paintings.&lt;ref name="GIBS1989"/&gt;

The geographer [[Otto Schlüter]] is credited with having first formally used  “cultural landscape” as an academic term in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref name="JAMA1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ELKINS, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. ENTRIKEN, J. Nicholas &amp; BRUNN, Stanley D (Eds) Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC. Page 27&lt;/ref&gt;  He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (transl. 'cultural landscape') a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.''

It was [[Carl O. Sauer]], a [[human geography|human geographer]], who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;JAMES, P.E &amp; MARTIN, G (1981) All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York. Page 321-324.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth’s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act.&lt;ref name ="SAUE1925"&gt;SAUER, C (1925) ''The Morphology of Landscape''. University of California Publications in Geography. Number 22. Pages 19-53&lt;/ref&gt;  His classic definition of a 'cultural landscape' reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''“The cultural landscape is fashioned from a [[natural landscape]] by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since Schlüter's first formal use of the term, and Sauer's effective promotion of the idea, the concept of 'cultural landscapes has been variously used, applied, debated, developed and refined within academia. In the 1950s, for instance, [[J.B. Jackson]] and his publication [[Landscape_(magazine)|'Landscape']] influenced a generation of particularly American scholars, including architectural historians [[Denise Scott Brown]], and [[Gwendolyn Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56028907|title=Everyday America : cultural landscape studies after J.B. Jackson|date=2003|publisher=University of California Press|others=Wilson, Chris, 1951 December 23-, Groth, Paul Erling.|isbn=9780520935907|location=Berkeley|oclc=56028907}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1992, the World Heritage Committee elected to convene a meeting of the 'specialists' to advise and assist redraft the Committee's Operational Guidelines to include 'cultural landscapes' as an option for heritage listing properties that were neither purely natural nor purely cultural in form (i.e. 'mixed' heritage).&lt;ref name="FOWL2003"&gt;FOWLER, P.J (2003) World Heritage Cultural Landscapes 1992 - 2002. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris, France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The World Heritage Committee's adoption and use of the concept of 'cultural landscapes' has seen multiple specialists around the world, and many nations identifying 'cultural landscapes', assessing 'cultural landscapes', heritage listing 'cultural landscapes', managing 'cultural landscapes', and effectively making 'cultural landscapes' known and visible to the world, with very practical ramifications and challenges.&lt;ref name="FOWL2003"/&gt;

A 2006 academic review of the combined efforts of the World Heritage Committee, multiple specialists around the world, and nations to apply the concept of 'cultural landscapes', observed and concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"Although the concept of landscape has been unhooked for some time from its original art associations ... there is still a dominant view of landscapes as an inscribed surface, akin to a map or a text, from which cultural meaning and social forms can simply be read."''&lt;ref&gt;PANNELL, S (2006) Reconciling Nature and Culture in a Global Context: Lessons form the World Heritage List. James Cook University, Cairns. Page 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within academia, any system of interaction between human activity and natural habitat is  regarded as a cultural landscape. In a sense this understanding is broader than the definition applied within UNESCO, including, as it does, almost the whole of the world's occupied surface, plus almost all the uses, ecologies, interactions, practices, beliefs, concepts, and traditions of people living within cultural landscapes.&lt;ref name="FOWL2003"/&gt; Following on this, geographer [[Xoán Paredes]] defines cultural landscape as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"... the environment modified by the human being in the course of time, the long-term combination between anthropic action on this environment and the physical constraints limiting or conditioning human activity. It is a geographical area – including natural and cultural resources – associated to historical evolution, which gives way to a recognizable landscape for a particular human group, up to the point of being identifiable as such by others."''&lt;ref&gt;PAREDES, X.M. (2015a) ''A utilidade do celtismo. Celticidade galaica no S.XXI''. Proceedings of Jornadas das Letras Galego-Portuguesas 2012-2014, DTS and SAGA. Pages 175-190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PAREDES, X.M. (2015b): “Nem ordem nem progresso para o nosso território. O (des)ordenamento territorial na Galiza”. ''Revista Inter. Interdisc. INTERthesis'', v.12, n. 12, Universidade Federal de Sta. Catarina, Florianópolis, Brasil, pp. 95-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Universities now offer specialist degrees in the study of cultural landscapes, including, for instance, the Universities of Naples, St.-Étienne, and Stuttgart who offer a Master of Cultural Landscapes diploma.

==Examples==
The World Heritage Committee has identified and listed a number of areas or properties as cultural landscapes of universal value to humankind, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/culturallandscape/ Cultural Landscape] UNESCO. Accessed 9 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tongariro National Park, New Zealand (1993)===
[[File:Tongariro Mahuia River n.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Tongariro Mahuia River in the [[Tongariro National Park]], [[New Zealand]] ]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In 1993 [[Tongariro National Park]], became the first property to be inscribed on the World Heritage List under the revised criteria describing cultural landscapes. The mountains at the heart of the park have cultural and religious significance for the Maori people and symbolize the spiritual links between this community and its environment. The park has active and extinct volcanoes, a diverse range of ecosystems and some spectacular landscapes."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, Australia (1994)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This park, formerly called [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock – Mount Olga) National Park, features spectacular geological formations that dominate the vast red sandy plain of central Australia. Uluru, an immense monolith, and Kata Tjuta, the rock domes located west of Uluru, form part of the traditional belief system of one of the oldest human societies in the world. The traditional owners of Uluru-Kata Tjuta are the Anangu Aboriginal people."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rice Terraces of Philippine Cordilleras (1995)===
[[File:Inside the Batad rice terraces.jpg|200px|thumb|The Batad rice terraces, The [[Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras]], the first site to be included in the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] cultural landscape category in 1995.&lt;ref name=not-danger&gt;{{cite news|last=Malig|first=Jojo|title=Philippine rice terraces no longer in danger|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/-depth/06/26/12/philippine-rice-terraces-no-longer-danger|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABS-CBN News]]|date=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"For 2,000 years, the high rice fields of the Ifugao have followed the contours of the mountains. The fruit of knowledge handed down from one generation to the next, and the expression of sacred traditions and a delicate social balance, they have helped to create a landscape of great beauty that expresses the harmony between humankind and the environment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Cultural Landscape of Sintra Portugal (1995)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In the 19th century [[Sintra]] became the first centre of European Romantic architecture. Ferdinand II turned a ruined monastery into a castle where this new sensitivity was displayed in the use of Gothic, Egyptian, Moorish and Renaissance elements and in the creation of a park blending local and exotic species of trees. Other fine dwellings, built along the same lines in the surrounding serra, created a unique combination of parks and gardens which influenced the development of landscape architecture throughout Europe". &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Portovenere, Cinque Terre, and the Islands (Palmaria, Tino and Tinetto), Italy (1997)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The [[Parco Nazionale delle Cinque Terre#UNESCO World Heritage Site|Ligurian coast between Cinque Terre and Portovenere is a cultural landscape]] of great scenic and cultural value. The layout and disposition of the small towns and the shaping of the surrounding landscape, overcoming the disadvantages of a steep, uneven terrain, encapsulate the continuous history of human settlement in this region over the past millennium."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hortobágy National Park, Hungary (1999)===
[[File:Hungarian Grey Cattle.jpg|200px|thumb|Hungarian Grey Cattle in [[Hortobágy National Park]]. ]] 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hortobágy National Park]] is the largest continuous natural grassland in Europe, which means that it was not formed as a result of deforestation or river control. The first Hungarian national park (established in 1973), it is the country's largest protected area (82 thousand hectares). A significant part of it is Biosphere Reserve and a quarter of its area enjoys international protection under the Ramsar Convention on the conservation of wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;Hungarian Tourism Plc., Hortobágy National Park&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Matobo Hills, Zimbabwe (2003)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[Matobo National Park|Matobo Hills]] area exhibits a profusion of distinctive rock landforms rising above the granite shield that covers much of Zimbabwe. The large boulders provide abundant natural shelters and have been associated with human occupation from the early Stone Age right through to early historical times, and intermittently since. They also feature an outstanding collection of rock paintings. The Matopo Hills continue to provide a strong focus for the local community, which still uses shrines and sacred places closely linked to traditional, social and economic activities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dresden Elbe Valley, Germany (2004)===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The 18th- and 19th-century cultural landscape of [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] ... features low meadows, and is crowned by the Pillnitz Palace and the centre of Dresden with its numerous monuments and parks from the 16th to 20th centuries. The landscape also features 19th- and 20th-century suburban villas and gardens and valuable natural features."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This landscape was struck from the World Heritage list in 2009, due to the construction of a four lane highway across the Elbe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/ |title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=June 25, 2009| website= |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=October 14, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===West Lake Cultural Landscape of Hangzhou, China (2011)===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The [[West Lake]] Cultural Landscape of [[Hangzhou]], comprising the West Lake and the hills surrounding its three sides, has inspired famous poets, scholars and artists since the 9th century. It comprises numerous temples, pagodas, pavilions, gardens and ornamental trees, as well as causeways and artificial islands."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Qhapaq Ñan (Inca Road System), Peru, Colombia, Equator, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile (2014) ===

[[Inca road system|Qhapaq Ñan]] is an extensive Inca communication, trade and defense network of roads covering 30,000&amp;nbsp; km. Constructed by the Incas over several centuries and partly based on pre-Inca infrastructure, this extraordinary network through one of the world’s most extreme geographical terrains linked the snow-capped peaks of the Andes – at an altitude of more than 6,000 m – to the coast, running through hot rainforests, fertile valleys, and absolute deserts. It reached its maximum expansion in the 15th century when it spread across the length and breadth of the Andes. The Qhapac Ñan, Andean Road System includes 273 component sites spread over more than 6,000&amp;nbsp; km that were selected to highlight the social, political, architectural and engineering achievements of the network, along with its associated infrastructure for trade, accommodation, and storage, as well as sites of religious significance. [16]

[[File:West Lake - Hangzhou, China.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[West Lake]] of [[Hangzhou]] [[World Heritage Site]]. According to the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]], it reflects "an idealized fusion between humans and nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/767 Ancient Chinese cultural landscape, the West Lake of Hangzhou, inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''culture of [[Iran]]''' ({{lang-fa|فرهنگ ایران|Farhang-e Irān}}), also known as '''[[Name of Iran|culture of Persia]]''', is one of the oldest in the world. Owing to its dominant geo-political position and culture in the world, Iran has directly influenced cultures and peoples as far away as [[Italy]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and [[Greece]] to the West, [[Russia]] to the North, the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the South, and [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]] to the East.
Thus an eclectic cultural elasticity has been said to be one of the key defining characteristics of the Persian spirit and a clue to its historical longevity.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, A. ''Lost Wisdom''. 2004.{{ISBN|0-934211-90-6}} p.15&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Iran's culture has manifested itself in several facets throughout the [[history of Iran]] as well as the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], [[Anatolia]], and [[Mesopotamia]]. 

The article uses the words ''Persian'' and ''Iranian'' interchangeably, sometimes referring to the language and its speakers, and other times referring to the name of pre-20th century Iran, a nomenclature which survives from western explorers and orientalists. They are not the same and the cultures of the peoples of [[Greater Persia]] are the focus of this article.

Iran has one of the richest [[art]] heritages in world history and encompasses many disciplines including [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[weaving]], [[pottery]], [[calligraphy]], [[metalworking]] and [[stonemasonry]]. There is also a very vibrant [[Iranian modern and contemporary art]] scene.

Iranian art has gone through numerous phases. The unique [[aesthetics]] of Iran is evident from the [[Achaemenid]] reliefs in [[Persepolis]] to the mosaic paintings of [[Bishapur]]. The Islamic era brought drastic changes to the styles and practice of the arts, each dynasty with its own particular foci. The [[Qajar dynasty|Qajarid era]] was the last stage of classical Persian art, before [[modernism]] was imported and suffused into elements of traditionalist schools of aesthetics.

===Language and literature===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Sham e akhar.jpg|thumb|right|Iranian cinema continues to produce acclaimed, often controversial works]] --&gt;
{{Main article|Persian literature}}
{{See also|Persian language|Persian literature in Western culture}}

Several languages are spoken in different regions of Iran. The predominant language and national language is [[Persian language|Persian]], which is spoken across the country. [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] is spoken primarily and widely in the northwest, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] primarily in the west as well as [[Luri language|Luri]], [[Mazandarani language|Mazandarani]] and [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]] at the [[Caspian Sea]] coastal regions, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] primarily in the Persian Gulf coastal regions, [[Balochi language|Balochi]] primarily in the desolate and remote far southeast, and [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] primarily in northern border regions. Smaller languages spread in other regions notably include [[Talysh language|Talysh]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]], and [[Circassian language|Circassian]], amongst others.

Persian literature inspired [[Goethe]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and many others, and it has been often dubbed as a most worthy language to serve as a conduit for poetry. Dialects of Persian are sporadically spoken throughout the region from China to [[Syria]] to Russia, though mainly in the [[Iranian Plateau]].

Contemporary Iranian literature is influenced by classical Persian poetry, but also reflects the particularities of modern-day Iran, through writers such as [[Houshang Moradi-Kermani]], the most translated modern Iranian author, and poet [[Ahmad Shamlou]].&lt;ref&gt;HOUSHMAND, Zara, "Iran", ''in'' ''[[Literature from the "Axis of Evil"]]'' (a [[Words Without Borders]] anthology), {{ISBN|978-1-59558-205-8}}, 2006, pp.1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion in Iran==
{{see also|Religion and culture in ancient Iran}}

[[File:Masjid Shah, view of the courtyard by Pascal Coste.jpg|thumb|[[Shah Mosque]], [[Isfahan]]. Painting by  French Architect [[Pascal Coste]], visiting Persia in 1841.]]

[[Zoroastrianism]] was the national faith of Iran for more than a millennium before the [[Arab conquest]]. It has had an immense influence on [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Iranian culture|culture]] and [[Persian art and architecture|art]] after the people of Iran converted to [[Conversion to Islam|Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaul Shaked, ''From Zoroastrian Iran to Islam'', 1995; and Henry Corbin, ''En Islam Iranien: Aspects spirituels et philosophiques'' (4 vols.), Gallimard, 1971-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today of the 98% of Muslims living in Iran, around 89% are [[Shi’a]] and only around 9% are [[Sunni]].This is quite the opposite trend of the percentage distribution of Shi’a to Sunni Islam followers in the rest of the Muslim population from state to state (primarily in the Middle East) and throughout the rest of the world. This data is from the government of Iran and most likely contains false information. It is very likely that the percentage of Muslims living in Iran is highly exaggerated as Islam is forced under the Islamic Republic's sharia law.

Followers of the [[Baha'i]] faith comprise the largest non-Muslim minority in Iran. Followers of the Baha'i faith are scattered throughout small communities in Iran, although there seems to be a large population of people who follow the Baha'i faith in [[Tehran]]. Most of the Baha'i are of Persian descent, although there seem to be many among the [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] and [[Kurdish people]]. The Baha'i are severely [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|persecuted]].

Followers of the [[Christian]] faith comprise around 250,000 Armenians, around 32,000 [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], and a small number of Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Protestant Iranians that have been converted by missionaries in earlier centuries. Thus, Christians that live in Iran are primarily descendants of indigenous Christians that were converted during the 19th and 20th centuries. Judaism is an officially recognized faith in Iran, and in spite of the hostilities between Iran and Israel over the Palestinian issue, the millennia old Jewish community in Iran enjoys the right to practice their religion freely as well as a dedicated seat in parliament to a representative member of their faith. In addition to [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] is another officially recognized religion in Iran, although followers of this faith do not hold a large population in Iran. In addition, although there have been isolated incidences of prejudice against Zoroastrians, most followers of this faith have not been persecuted for being followers of this faith.&lt;ref name=Religion&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran Index of Religion|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/countries/bl_IranIndex.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holidays in Iran==
{{see also| Holidays in Iran| Iranian Calendar |List of festivals in Iran}}

The Persian year begins in the [[vernal equinox]]: if the astronomical vernal equinox comes before noon, then the present day is the first day of the Persian year. If the equinox falls after noon, then the next day is the official first day of the Persian year. The [[Persian Calendar]], which is the official calendar of Iran, is a solar calendar with a starting point that is the same as the Islamic calendar. According to the Iran Labor Code, Friday is the weekly day of rest. Government official working hours are from Saturday to Wednesday (from 8 am to 4 pm).&lt;ref name="Holidays 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran Holidays 2013|url=http://www.qppstudio.net/publicholidays2013/iran.htm|publisher=Q++ Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the date of certain holidays in Iran are not exact (due to the calendar system they use, most of these holidays are around the same time), some of the major public holidays in Iran include [[Nationalization of the Iranian oil industry|Oil Nationalization Day]] (20 March), [[Nowrooz]]—which is the Iranian equivalent of [[New Years]] (20 March), the Prophet’s Birthday and Imam Sadeq (4 June), and the Death of [[Imam Khomeini]] (5 June). Additional holidays include The Anniversary of the Uprising Against the Shah (30 January), [[Ashoura]] (11 February), Victory of the [[1979 Islamic Revolution]] (2 April), [[Sizdah-Bedar]]—Public Outing Day to end Nowrooz (1 April), and [[Iranian Islamic Republic Day|Islamic Republic Day]] (20 January).

==Wedding ceremonies==
{{See also|Persian wedding}}

There are two stages in a typical wedding ritual in Iran. Usually both phases take place in one day. The first stage is known as "Aghd", which is basically the legal component of marriage in Iran. In this process, the Bride and Groom as well as their respective guardians sign a marriage contract. This phase usually takes place in the bride's home. After this legal process is over, the second phase, "Jashn-e Aroosi" takes place. In this step, which is basically the wedding reception, where actual feasts and celebrations are held, typically lasts from about 3–7 days. The ceremony takes place in a decorated room with flowers and a beautifully decorated spread on the floor. This spread is typically passed down from mother to daughter and is composed of very nice fabric such as "[[Termeh]]" (cashmere), "Atlas" (gold embroidered [[satin]]), or "[[Abrisham]]" (silk).

[[File:Iranian Wedding Ceremony.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=text|Iranian Wedding Ceremony]]

Items are placed on this spread: a Mirror (of fate), two Candelabras (representing the bride and groom and their bright future), a tray of seven multi-colored herbs and spices (including poppy seeds, wild rice, angelica, salt, nigella seeds, black tea, and frankincense). These herbs and spices play specific roles ranging from breaking spells and witchcraft, to blinding the evil eye, to burning evil spirits. In addition to these herbs/spices, a special baked and decorated flatbread, a basket of decorated eggs, decorated almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts (in their shell to represent fertility), a basket of pomegranates/apples (for a joyous future as these fruits are considered divine), a cup of rose water (from special Persian roses)—which helps perfume the air, a bowl made out of sugar (apparently to sweeten life for the newlywed couple), and a brazier holding burning coals and sprinkled with wild rue (as a way to keep the evil eye away and to purify the wedding ritual) are placed on the spread as well. Finally, there are additional items that must be placed on the spread, including a bowl of gold coins (to represent wealth and prosperity), a scarf/shawl made of silk/fine fabric (to be held over the bride and groom’s head at certain points in the ceremony), two sugar cones—which are ground above the bride and groom's head, thus symbolizing sweetness/happiness, a cup of honey (to sweeten life), a needle and seven strands of colored thread (the shawl that is held above the bride and groom’s head is sewn together with the string throughout the ceremony), and a copy of the couple’s [[Holy Book]] (other religions require different texts); but all of these books symbolize God's blessing for the couple.&lt;ref name=Wedding&gt;{{cite web|title=Persian Wedding Traditions and Customs|url=http://www.farsinet.com/persian_wedding/|publisher=Farsinet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An early age in marriage—especially for brides—is a long documented feature of marriage in Iran. While the people of Iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage, there have been countless blocks to such an attempt. Although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades, young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in Iran—even though there is an article in the Iranian Civil Code that forbid the marriage of women younger than 15 years of age and males younger than 18 years of age.&lt;ref name="Weddings 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Momeni|first=Djamehid|title=The Difficulties of Changing the Age at Marriage in Iran|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|date=August 1972|pages=545|doi=10.2307/350454|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persian rugs==

In Iran, [[Persian rugs]] have always been a vital part of the Persian culture.

[[File:Antique Persian Mashad rug.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=text|Antique Persian Mashad Rug]]

Iranians were some of the first people in history to weave carpets. First deriving from the notion of basic need, the Persian rug started out as a simple/pure weave of fabric that helped nomadic people living in ancient Iran stay warm from the cold, damp ground. As time progressed, the complexity and beauty of rugs increased to a point where rugs are now bought as decorative pieces.&lt;ref name="Rugs 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Opie|first=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|year=1981|location=Portland, OR|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the long history of fine silk and wool rug weaving in Iran, Persian rugs are world-renowned as some of the most beautiful, intricately designed rugs available. Around various places in Iran, rugs seem to be some of the most prized possessions of the local people. Iran currently produces more rugs and carpets than all other countries in the world put together.&lt;ref name="Rugs 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Persian Rugs, Persian Carpets, and Oriental Rugs|url=http://www.farsinet.com/persianrug/|publisher=Farsinet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern culture==

===Cinema===
{{Main article|Cinema of Iran}}

With 300 international awards in the past 10 years, Iranian films continue to be celebrated worldwide. The best known Persian directors are [[Abbas Kiarostami]], [[Majid Majidi]], [[Jafar Panahi]] and [[Asghar Farhadi]].

===Contemporary art===
{{Main article|Iranian modern and contemporary art}}
{{See also|List of Iranian painters}}

There is a resurgence of interest in Iranian contemporary artists and in artists from the larger Iranian diaspora. Key notables include [[Shirin Aliabadi]], Mohammed Ehsai, Ramin Haerizadeh, Rokni Haerizadeh, [[Golnaz Fathi]], [[Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian]], Parastou Forouhar, [[Pouran Jinchi]], [[Farhad Moshiri (artist)|Farhad Moshiri]], [[Shirin Neshat]], Parviz Tanavoli, Y. Z. Kami, and Charles Hossein Zenderoudi.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Art"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forbes: Why Today's Iranian Art is One of your best investments|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/abigailesman/2011/01/10/the-art-of-war-why-todays-iranian-art-is-one-of-your-best-investments-now/ | first=Abigail R. | last=Esman|date=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main article|Music of Iran|Persian traditional music}}
{{See also|List of Iranian musicians and singers}}

The music of Persia dates to before the days of [[Barbod]] in the royal [[Sassanid]] courts. This is where many music cultures trace their distant origins.

====Traditional tea-houses====

There are countless numbers of traditional tea-houses (''chai khooneh'') throughout Iran, and each province features its own unique cultural presentation of this ancient tradition. However, there are certain traits which are common to all tea-houses, especially the most visible aspects, strong ''[[Masala chai|chai]]'' ([[tea]]) and the ever-present ''ghalyan [[hookah]]''. Almost all tea-houses serve ''baqleh'', steam boiled [[Vicia faba|fava]] beans (in the pod), served with salt and vinegar, as well as a variety of desserts and pastries. Many tea-houses also serve full meals, typically a variety of [[kebab]]s, as well as regional specialties.

===Persian gardens===
{{Main article|Persian gardens}}

The Persian garden was designed as a reflection of paradise on earth; the word "garden" itself coming from Persian roots. The special place of the garden in the Iranian heart can be seen in their architecture, in the ruins of Iran, and in their paintings.

===Cuisine===
{{Main article|Iranian cuisine}}

Cuisine in Iran is considered to be one of the most ancient forms of cuisine around the world. Bread is arguably the most important food in Iran, with a large variety of different bread, some of the most popular of which include: [[Naan|nan]] and hamir, which are baked in large clay ovens (also called "tenurs"). In Iranian cuisine, there are many dishes that are made from dairy products. One of the most popular of which includes yoghurt ("mast")—which has a specific fermentation process that is widely put to use amongst most Iranians. In addition, [[Strained yogurt|mast]] is used to make soup and is vital in the production of oil. In addition to these dairy products, Iranian cuisine involves a lot of dishes cooked from rice. Some popular rice dishes include boiled rice with a variety of ingredients such as meats, vegetables, and seasonings ("plov") including dishes like chelo-horesh, shish kebab with rice, chelo-kebab, rice with lamb, meatballs with rice, and kofte (plain boiled rice). In addition, Iranian cuisine is famous for its sweets. One of the most famous of which includes "baklava" with almonds, cardamom, and egg yolks. Iranian sweets typically involve the use of honey, cinnamon, lime juice, and sprouted wheat grain. One very popular dessert drink in Iran, "sherbet sharbat-portagal", is made from a mixture of orange peel and orange juice boiled in thin sugar syrup and diluted with rose water. Just like the people of many Middle Eastern countries the most preferred drink of the people of Iran is tea (without milk) or "kakhve-khana".&lt;ref name=Cuisine&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranian National Cuisine|url=http://www.sairamtour.com/silkroad/sr_07_2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928050802/http://www.sairamtour.com/silkroad/sr_07_2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-28|publisher=The Great Silk Road}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main article|Sport in Iran}}
* The game of [[Polo]] originated with Iranian tribes in ancient times and was regularly seen throughout the country until the revolution of 1979 where it became associated with the monarchy. It continues to be played, but only in rural areas and discreetly. Recently, as of 2005, it has been acquiring an increasingly higher profile. In March 2006, there was a highly publicised tournament and all significant matches are now televised.
* The [[Varzesh-e Pahlavani|Iranian Zoor Khaneh]]

==Women in Persian culture==
{{Main article|Iranian women}}

Since the 1979 Revolution, Iranian women have had more opportunities in some areas and more restrictions in others. One of the striking features of the Revolution was the large scale participation of women from traditional backgrounds in demonstrations leading up to the overthrow of the monarchy. The Iranian women who had gained confidence and higher education during the Pahlavi era participated in demonstrations against the Shah to topple the monarchy. The culture of education for women was established by the time of revolution so that even after the revolution, large numbers of women entered civil service and higher education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ungei.org/infobycountry/iran_550.html |title=Adult education offers new opportunities and options to Iranian women |publisher=Ungei.org |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1996 fourteen women were elected to the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]]. In 2003, Iran's first woman judge during the Pahlavi era, [[Shirin Ebadi]], won the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts in promoting human rights.

According to a UNESCO world survey, at the primary level of enrollment Iran has the highest female to male ratio in the world among sovereign nations, with a female to male ratio of 1.22 : 1.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/edu_gir_to_boy_rat_pri_lev_enr-boys-ratio-primary-level-enrolment |title=Girls to boys ratio, primary level enrolment statistics - countries compared |publisher=NationMaster |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1999, Iran had 140 female publishers, enough to hold an exhibition of books and magazines published by women.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Great Revolution'' by Robin Wright c2000, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, 65% of Iran's university students and 43% of its salaried workers were women.&lt;ref&gt;Ebadi, Shirin, Iran Awakening : A Memoir of Revolution and Hope by Shirin Ebadi with Azadeh Moaveni, Random House, 2006 (p.210)&lt;/ref&gt; and as of early 2007 nearly 70% of Iran's science and engineering students are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7115/full/444022a.html|title=Islam and Science: An Islamist revolution|first=Ehsan|last=Masood|date=2 November 2006|journal=Nature|volume=444|issue=7115|pages=22–25|accessdate=24 June 2017|via=nature.com|doi=10.1038/444022a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to many female school and university graduates being under-utilized. This is beginning to have an effect on Iranian society and was a contributing factor to protests by Iranian youth.

During recent decades, Iranian women have had significant presence in Iran's [[Science in Iran|scientific movement]], [[Iranian modern and contemporary art|art movement]], [[Persian literature|literary new wave]] and contemporary [[Iranian cinema]]. Women account for 60% of all students in the natural sciences, including one in five PhD students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/290/5496/1485|title=Iranian Women Hear the Call of Science|publisher=sciencemag.org|accessdate=13 January 2016|doi=10.1126/science.290.5496.1485|volume=290|page=1485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional holidays/celebrations==
{{Main article|Iranian festivals}}

Iranians celebrate the following days based on a [[solar calendar]], in addition to important religious days of [[Islamic]] and [[Shia]] calendars, which are based on a [[moon|lunar]] calendar.
* [[Nowruz]] (Iranian New Year) - Starts from 21 March
* [[Sizdah be dar]] (Nature Day)
* [[Tirgan|Jashn-e-Tirgan]] (Water Festival)
* [[Sadeh|Jashn-e-Sadeh]] (Fire Festival)
* [[Mehregan|Jashn-e-Mehregan]] (Autumn Festival)
* [[Shab-e-Yalda]] (Winter Feast)

==Traditional cultural inheritors of the old Persia==
{{Main article|Persianate society}}

[[File:Georgian prince by Reza Abbasi.jpg|thumb|Prince Muhammad-Beik of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], 1620. Artist is [[Reza Abbasi]].]]

Like the [[Persian carpet]] that exhibits numerous colors and forms in a dazzling display of warmth and creativity, Persian culture is the glue that bonds the peoples of western and central Asia. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]] "occupy an important place in the historical geography of Persian civilization. Much of the region was included in the Pre-Islamic [[Persian empire]]s, and many of its ancient peoples either belonged to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European peoples (e.g. [[Medes]] and [[Soghdians]]), or were in close cultural contact with them (e.g. the [[Armenians]]).&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Herzing, ''Iran and the former Soviet South'', The Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1995, {{ISBN|1-899658-04-1}} p.48&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Iranologist [[Richard Nelson Frye]]:
: ''Many times I have emphasized that the present peoples of central Asia, whether Iranian or Turkic speaking, have one culture, one religion, one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them.''

The Culture of [[Persia]] has thus developed over several thousand years. But historically, the peoples of what are now [[Iran]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], are related to one another as part of the larger group of peoples of the [[Greater Iran]]ian cultural and historical sphere. The [[Northern Caucasus]] is well within the sphere of influence of Persian culture as well, as can be seen from the many remaining relics, ruins, and works of literature from that region.[https://web.archive.org/web/20051108144233/http://sscl.berkeley.edu/arf/main/stronach.html (e.g. 1)] [[Derbent|(e.g. 2)]]

'''''Eating Media Lunch'' (EML)''' was a [[satire|satirical]] [[New Zealand]] [[news show]] hosted by [[Jeremy Wells]]. It aired on [[TV 2 (New Zealand)|TV 2]] and online on [[TVNZ OnDemand]] from 2003 to 2008. The show was frequently controversial during its run.

== Notable episodes ==
In 2005 it shocked some viewers when it depicted two newsreaders fornicating&lt;ref name=tvnz&gt;{{cite web | title =  Eating Media Lunch | work = TVNZ | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/content/427620/6198330.xhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a parody of [[Naked News]]). It frequently caused complaints to the [[Broadcasting Standards Authority]], ranging from complaints about the show's treatment of New Zealand celebrities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TVNZ and Wolf | work = Broadcasting Standard Authority | url = http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/2006/2006-001.htm | date = 2006-02-22 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100522085349/http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/2006/2006-001.htm | archivedate = 2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to complaints about an episode which showed a [[cat]] in a [[microwave oven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = TVNZ and Panasiuk | work = Broadcasting Standards Authority | url = http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/2005/2005-060.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100522091406/http://www.bsa.govt.nz/decisions/2005/2005-060.htm | archivedate = 2010-05-22 | date = 2005-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Paul Casserly noted that portrayals of violence against animals were certain to attract complaints, such as the show which claimed to feature famous sheep [[Shrek (sheep)|Shrek]] being slaughtered, while the spoof Maori porn movie 'Anal Mana' saw no complaints.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_167515"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/167515/Content-may-offend |title=Content may offend |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=29 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Innovations ==
The show features a regular animated segment by [[Anthony Ellison]] titled '''Media Dog''' which was [http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tv2_story_skin/427620?format=html available online]. Since 2004 the series had included an annual 'awards' show which  "honour[s] the absurd and the unusual as seen on television, radio and newspapers" categories include: "Services to Scaremongering, Worst Moment on Reality TV, The Inappropriate Touching Award and the much coveted [[New Zealander of the Year]] trophy."&lt;ref name=tvnz /&gt;

The 2006 season featured former [[Close Up (TV programme)|Close Up]] reporter [[Hugh Sundae]] as well as [[Matt Heath (Back of the Y)|Matt Heath]] and [[Chris Stapp]] from [[Back of the Y]]. According to [[TVNZ]] the 2006 season tackled "racism, reality TV and the country's best-known protesters".&lt;ref name=tvnz /&gt; The 2008 season won best comedy at the [[Qantas Film and TV Awards]].&lt;ref name=canned&gt;{{cite web | title =  Media lunch off the telly menu | work = [[New Zealand Herald]] | date = 2009-04-05 | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10565288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last season ==
In 2009 when TVNZ faced $25 million in budget cuts as a result of the [[recession]] and declining advertising revenue, the network made the decision not to commission a 2009 season of Eating Media Lunch.&lt;ref name=canned /&gt;

Escorted tours are also known as ''Guided tours'' or ''[[Package tour|Package Tours]]''.

Escorted tours are normally conducted by a [[Tour guide|tour]] director who takes care of all services from the beginning to end of the tour. Escorted tours also normally include the flights, hotels, [[transportation]], transfers to the [[airport]]/[[hotel]], most meals and some [[sightseeing]]. Escorted tours are often conducted by motor coach and usually no more than three nights are spent in each location visited. They are usually fast-paced and prices include most everything.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1612">'''Ethnostatistics''' is the study of the social activity of producing and using [[statistics]]. The premise of the area of study is that statistics are themselves not neutral facts, but are themselves influenced by the social biases of the persons involved in their production. The concept was suggested in [[John Kitsuse]] or [[Aaron Cicourel]] in their 1962 article, "A Note on Official Statistics", published in ''[[Social Problems]]'', where they suggested that "criminal statistics" are indicative of the social organization of the agencies responsible for assembling them. The concept was developed by sociologist Robert Gephart in his 1988 book, ''Ethnostatistics''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Marshall, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Sociology'' (1994), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of study "uses concepts from ethnomethodology to study sensemaking practices that social scientists employ in the production, [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], and display of statistics created in social research".&lt;ref name="Sage"&gt;Michael Lewis-Beck, Alan E Bryman, Tim Futing Liao, ''The SAGE Encyclopedia of Social Science Research Methods'' (2003), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; As of the early 2000s, there were three "levels" of ethnostatistics, the first examining the social production of statistics, the second using [[computer simulation]]s to examine the degree to which methods of gathering statistics may distort data, and third examining the persuasive effect of statistics on their end consumer.&lt;ref name="Sage"/&gt;

[[File:Faddan More Psalter cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of the psalter, after conservation]]
The '''Faddan More Psalter''' ({{lang-ga|Saltair an Fheadáin Mhóir}}) (also '''Irish Bog Psalter''' or "Faddan Mor Psalter") is an [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] Christian [[psalter]] or text of the [[book of Psalms]], discovered in a [[peat bog]] in July 2006, in the townland of [[Faddan More]] ({{lang-ga|Feadán Mór}}) in north [[County Tipperary]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=IOL&gt;[http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/story.asp?j=191201038&amp;p=y9yzxy744&amp;n=191201798 Location of 'Ireland's Dead Sea Scrolls' revealed]- IOL news 05/08/2006 – 09:50:08&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was probably written in about 800 in one of a number of monasteries in the area.  A unique feature is that the inside of the leather cover is lined with [[papyrus]], probably as a stiffening, an indication of the links between the Irish and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic church]]es at the time.  After several years of conservation work, the psalter went on display at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Kildare St, Dublin in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;NMI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cunningham|first=Grainne|title=Public gets first look at ancient book of psalms|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/public-gets-first-look-at-ancient-book-of-psalms-2668780.html|accessdate=9 June 2011|newspaper=The Irish Independent|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery was hailed by the National Museum of Ireland as one of the most significant Irish [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds in decades.&lt;ref name=RTE&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0725/manuscript.html Ancient manuscript discovered in the Midlands] – RTÉ News&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Meehan of the [[Trinity College Library]], who was called in to advise on the discovery, said that he believed the psalter was the first discovery of an Irish early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[manuscript]] in two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Meehan cited in the [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/psalms-emerge-from-irish-bog/2006/07/26/1153816254848.html Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt; During the conservation process, in the period 2006–2010, the lining of the binding was found to have elements of [[papyrus]], adding further evidence to the known links between Irish [[Celtic Christianity]] and the Egyptian [[Coptic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/manuscript-dug-from-bog-rates-among-our-top-10-biggest-finds-2325341.html ''Manuscript dug from bog rates among our top 10 biggest finds'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The psalter joins the very small number of very early Western books that have survived fully intact with their original [[bookbinding]]s.  These mostly have their origins in the monastic [[Insular art]] of Britain and Ireland, and the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missions to Europe.  The earliest is the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] of about 700 ([[British Library]]), and other examples probably of the mid-8th century are at [[Fulda]] on the continent. However the wallet-like style of the Faddan More binding, and the fact that it does not seem to have been physically attached to the sewn-together pages, make it unique among surviving covers.

==Description==
The psalter contains the Latin text of the Psalms, complete on 60 sheets of [[vellum]] in five gatherings or [[Paper quire|quire]]s. The text is a [[Latin_Psalters#Versio_Gallicana|Gallican]] version of the [[Vulgate]], written in [[Insular majuscule]] letters in a single column.  The first letter of each psalm has a capital and, as is often the case, the opening words of psalms 1, 51 and 101 are decorated, using black, red, and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;NMI&lt;/ref&gt;

The original leather binding has a fold-over flap with three horn buttons that were probably used to secure a thong or straps, now missing, that tied the cover up; it does not seem to have been physically attached to the gathered and sewn-together pages inside, forming what we might call today a folder or wallet.  Similar covers seem to be shown in some images in manuscripts, but no comparable covers have survived.  The outside of the cover was "painted with black carbon-based pigment".&lt;ref&gt;NMI PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The leather seems to have been used as a trial piece or sketchpad for composing patterns of [[interlace (art)|interlace]] for other objects. On the inside there is a sheet of papyrus, presumably used as a liner to stiffen the cover somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, and NMI PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Low oxygen levels in the bog provide unusual preservation conditions, and bogs were often used by Irish monks as hiding places for valuables in the face of [[Viking]] raids. In addition to low oxygen levels, [[sphagnum]] moss, of which the peat bog is composed, produces an antibiotic substance called [[sphagnan]] that binds with proteins on the surface of microorganisms, immobilising them. Its highly reactive carbonyl groups can alter chemicals and nutrients that would otherwise decompose organic matter. And above all the sphagnum moss causes organic material to undergo chemical changes itself that make it impervious to rot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2146638/ How do bogs keep things fresh?] by Daniel Engber, Slate, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
It was uncovered by bulldozer driver Eddie Fogarty,&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt; a worker extracting [[peat]] with a [[backhoe]]. Dr. Patrick Wallace, director of the National Museum, praised Fogarty for immediately having covered the book with damp soil, as exposure to dry air after so many centuries of dampness might have destroyed it.  The book was initially stored in refrigeration at the National Museum. Identifying the safest way to pry open the pages without damaging or destroying them was expected to take months, and conservation work to take two years.  The area around Faddan More Bog is rich in medieval history. Monastic foundations such as [[Lorrha]] and [[Terryglass]] in County Tipperary and [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] and Seirkieran in County Offaly are located nearby.&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt;

The bog is owned by local brothers Kevin and Patrick Leonard. Six years before the psalter find, a leather satchel was found that, by [[radiocarbon dating]], was estimated to originate from between the seventh and ninth centuries. This was located just 100m from the psalter findspot and is of a similar date suggesting that the satchel may have originally contained the book.  Additionally, in the years prior to 2006, two ancient wooden vessels were also found in the same bog.&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt;

==Misreported prophecy==
When found, the book was opened to a page displaying [[Psalms|Psalm]] [[s:la:The Old Testament (Vulgate)/Psalmi#83|83]] (in the [[Septuagint]] numbering), which corresponds with [[s:en:Bible (King James)/Psalms#84|Psalm 84]] in the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] numbering used in most English-language translations.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5584495 Ancient Psalms Found Preserved in Irish Bog] – NPR&lt;/ref&gt; Due to confusion regarding differences in numbering the Psalms, some news sites implied that the Psalter was open at the [[s:en:Bible (King James)/Psalms#83|Masoretic Psalm 83]]. That psalm contains such lines as "They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance"; this reference to the attempted destruction of [[Israel]] connected the find in some people's minds with the contemporaneous [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]. The matter was clarified by the director of the [[National Museum of Ireland]], who pointed out the difference in [[Septuagint]] vs. [[Masoretic]] numbering and that the displayed psalm contains no reference to the destruction of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2006/0728/1153813832813.html Museum plays diplomatic role on psalm's 'warning to Israel' – Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The National Museum of Ireland consulted with specialists in archaeological conservation and book conservation about the best way to conserve the psalter, and received partly conflicting advice. Ultimately a multi-phase conservation plan was determined. The first phase involved non-destructive examination of the psalter in the form in which it was discovered – e.g., photography, MRI scanning, and examination of the binding by book-binding specialists. In the second phase, experiments were done on 18th century parchments to determine the best way of drying waterlogged parchment. The most effective method involved soaking the parchment in ethanol to replace the water, placing it between blotting sheets, and vacuum-packing it. In the third phase, this technique was tested on small fragments of the psalter, and found to be effective. Conservators then began applying this method to larger sections of the psalter, and found they could consistently achieve shrinkage of only 2–5%, against 75% on a small fragment that was air-dried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=432d9d81-909c-4921-a86c-0992c01b4194 The Faddan More Psalter: a progress update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153450/http://www.museum.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=432d9d81-909c-4921-a86c-0992c01b4194 |date=15 June 2011 }}, by John Gillis and Anthony Read

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7875">In [[fiction]], a '''false protagonist''' is a [[literary technique]], often used to make  the plot more jarring or more memorable by fooling the audience's preconceptions, that constructs a character who the audience assumes is the [[protagonist]] but is later revealed not to be.

A false protagonist is presented at the start of the fictional work as the main character, but then is eradicated, often by killing them (usually for [[shock value]] or as a [[plot twist]]) or changed in terms of their role in the story (i.e. making them a lesser character, a character who leaves the story, or revealing them to actually be the [[antagonist]]).&lt;ref name="Tindale2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher W. Tindale|title=Fallacies and Argument Appraisal|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84208-2|pages=28–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In film, a character can be made to seem like the main protagonist based on a number of techniques (beyond just simply focusing the plot on their role). [[Bankable star|Star power]] is a very effective method; audience members generally assume that the biggest "name" in a movie will have a significant part to play. An abundance of [[close-up]]s can also be used as a subliminal method. Generally, the star of a film will get longer-lasting and more frequent close-ups than any other character, but this is rarely immediately apparent to viewers during the film. Alternatively, the false protagonist can serve as a narrator to the movie, encouraging the audience to assume that the character survives to tell their tale later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The antihero in popular culture: Life history theory and the dark triad personality traits.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0027914|journal = Review of General Psychology|pages = 192–199|volume = 16|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/a0027914|first = Peter K.|last = Jonason|first2 = Gregory D.|last2 = Webster|first3 = David P.|last3 = Schmitt|first4 = Norman P.|last4 = Li|first5 = Laura|last5 = Crysel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the same techniques used in film can also apply to [[television series|television]], but the episodic nature adds an additional possibility. By ending one or more [[television episode|episodes]] with the false protagonist still in place, the show can reinforce the viewers' belief in the character's protagonist status. Also, because TV shows often have changes of cast between seasons, some series can have unintentional false protagonists: characters who begin the series as the main character but then are replaced early in the show's run by another character entirely. When the series is viewed as a whole, this can lead to the appearance of a false protagonist.

In [[video game]]s, a false protagonist may initially be a playable character, only to be killed or revealed to be the antagonist. One key way in which video games employ the method that differs from uses in non-[[interactive]] [[fiction]] is by granting the player direct [[Game controller|control]] over the false protagonist. Since most video games allow a player to control only the main characters (and their success or failure is based on playing skill, not pre-determined story), the sudden demise of the character that is being controlled serves to surprise the player.

==Examples==
===Literature===
[[File:Hannah VICTORS, Jan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Book of Samuel'' starts with Samuel as a young boy. He was the main focus in the first few chapters until he eventually becomes a [[supporting character|minor character]].]]
*The ''[[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]]'' begins with [[Samuel]]'s birth and [[Yahweh|God]]'s call to him as a boy. At this point, the readers are led to believe that Samuel is the central figure in the book. Though by the sixteenth chapter, the book starts to primarily focus on [[King David|David]].{{sfn|Gordon|1986|p=18}}
*[[George R. R. Martin]]'s novel ''[[A Game of Thrones]]'', the first entry in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' epic fantasy series, features chapters told from the point of view of numerous characters, though the most prominent is [[Ned Stark]], who is generally assumed to be the novel's main protagonist until the final chapters where he is unexpectedly executed.&lt;ref name="EW 109 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/game-of-thrones-episode-9/ |title=''Game of Thrones'' recap: The Killing |first=James |last=Hibberd |page=1 |date=June 12, 2011|accessdate=August 17, 2014 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/06/13/game-of-thrones-watch-its-all-in-the-execution-2/ |title=''Game of Thrones'' Watch: The Unkindest Cut |first=James  |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |date=June 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
*[[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' opens with [[Marion Crane]] as the main character.  However, she is killed partway through the film, making the murder far more unexpected and shocking. Hitchcock felt that the opening scenes with Marion as the false protagonist were so important to the film that when it was released in theaters, he compelled theater owners to enforce a "no late admission" policy.&lt;ref name="Leigh"&gt;Leigh, Janet. ''Psycho : Behind the Scenes of the Classic Thriller''. Harmony Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-517-70112-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The film ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'' opens with [[Mark L. Taylor]]'s character, nature photographer Jerry Manley, as its focus. However, he is killed a mere ten minutes into the film by a seizure caused by a spider bite, after which the focus shifts to [[Jeff Daniels]]'s character, Dr. Ross Jennings.
*''[[Halloween: Resurrection]]'' opens with [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]'s character, [[Laurie Strode]], who was the main protagonist in the previous ''Halloween'' films, only to be murdered by the antagonist (Michael Myers) ten minutes into the film.

===Video Games===
*In ''[[Star Fox Adventures: Dinosaur Planet]]'', the games opens with the character [[Krystal (Star Fox)|Krystal]].  However, she is ambushed and sealed in a crystal just minutes into the game, at which point the game shifts to protagonist [[Fox McCloud]].
*The game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' begins with the character [[Roxas (Kingdom Hearts)|Roxas]] as its focal character.  However, more than an hour into the game, he finds the pods containing [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]] and vanishes immediately after (as he is actually a part of Sora), prompting the shift to focusing on Sora for the remainder of the game.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'', the game starts with series protagonist [[Solid Snake]]. But after the opening chapter, the game shifts to protagonist [[Raiden (Metal Gear)|Raiden]].  Players were unaware of this shift at the time, as developers kept it a secret by only showing Solid Snake in the trailers.
*In ''[[Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony]]'', the Prologue and Chapter 01 of the game is played from the view of Kaede Akamatsu, the Ultimate Pianist. However, after she is voted as the culprit and then executed at the End of Chapter 1's Class Trial, the rest of the Game is played from the view of Shuichi Saihara, the Ultimate Detective.
*In “[[Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War]]”, the first half of the game is played as the character Sigurd. However, halfway through the game, Sigurd is killed, and his son Seliph inherits the role of protagonist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2981">The '''female epic''' is a concept in [[literary criticism]] that seeks to expand generic boundaries by identifying ways in which women authors have adapted the masculine epic tradition to express their own heroic visions.

Historically, [[Epic poetry|epic]] literature has been considered an exclusively male domain, to the extent that "epic and masculinity appear to be almost coterminous." &lt;ref name="appanglo1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Schweizer | first = Bernard | title = Approaches to the Anglo and American Female Epic, 1621-1982 | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7546-5486-9 |page =1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]] to [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', the epic canon has been defined by works authored by men, and the characteristic subject matter and diction of the epic have carried connotations of masculinity. Recently, however, [[feminist]] literary critics have identified a number of texts written by women which, they argue, deserve to be considered epics, as they have many of the required qualities: emphasis on [[hero]]ism, [[Nation-building|nation building]], religious authority, a strong [[quest]] motif, and significant length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schweizer | first = Bernard | title = Rebecca West: Heroism, Rebellion, and the Female Epic | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-313-32360-7 | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these texts post-date Milton's ''Paradise Lost'' &amp;ndash; conventionally considered to be the last authentic epic in the Western tradition &amp;ndash;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler | first = Alastair | title =Kinds of Literature: An Introduction to the Theory of Genres and Modes| page = 167 | publisher=Harvard University Press | year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are by default "modern epics".
However, argue these critics, this is by no means a contradiction. The epic remains an authentic and vital literary genre, and one to which women have made valuable contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer (2006), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The breadth of these studies is indicated by the essays in [[Bernard Schweizer]]'s ''Approaches to the Anglo and American Female Epic, 1621-1982'' (2006), which features studies of, among others, [[Lady Mary Wroth]]’s ''The Countesse of Montgomeries Urania'', [[Mary Tighe]]’s ''Psyche'', [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]’s ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'', [[Sharon Doubiago]]’s ''Hard Country'', and [[Rebecca West]]’s ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]''.

'''Sir Galahad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|l|ə|h|æ|d}}; sometimes referred to as '''Galeas''' {{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|l|iː|ə|s}} or '''Galath''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|l|ə|θ}}), in [[Arthurian legend]], is a [[Knights of the Round Table|knight]] of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]] and one of the three achievers of the [[Holy Grail]]. He is the illegitimate son of Sir [[Lancelot]] and [[Elaine of Corbenic]], and is renowned for his gallantry and purity as the most perfect of all knights. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the [[Lancelot–Grail]] cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the [[Post-Vulgate Cycle]] and Sir [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. His name should not be mistaken with [[Galehaut]], a different knight from Arthurian legend.

==Origins==
The story of Galahad and his quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is a relatively late addition to the Arthurian legend. Galahad does not feature in any romance by [[Chrétien de Troyes]], or in [[Robert de Boron]]'s ''Perceval'', or in any of the continuations of Chrétien's story of the mysterious castle of the [[Fisher King]]. He first appears in a 13th-century [[Old French]] Arthurian epic, the interconnected set of romances known as the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate Cycle]]. 

The original conception of Galahad, whose adult exploits are first recounted in the fourth book of the Vulgate Cycle, may derive from the [[Cistercian Order]]. According to some interpreters, the philosophical inspiration of the celibate, otherworldly character of the monastic knight Galahad came from this monastic order set up by [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Matarasso, ''The Redemption of Chivalry''. Geneva, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cistercian-Bernardine concept of [[Catholic]] warrior-asceticism that so distinguishes the character of Galahad also informs St. Bernard's projection of ideal chivalry in his work on the [[Knights Templar]], ''De laude novae militiae''. Significantly, in the narratives, Galahad is associated with a white shield with a vermilion cross, the very same emblem given to the [[Knights Templar]] by [[Pope Eugene III]].

==Life==
===Conception and birth===
The circumstances surrounding the conception of the boy Galahad are explained by Sir [[Thomas Malory]] and derive from the Gareth-Grail cycle. It happens when [[King Arthur]]'s greatest knight, [[Lancelot]], mistakes [[Elaine of Corbenic]] for his secret mistress, Queen [[Guinevere]]. According to Malory, [[King Pelles]] has already received magical foreknowledge that Lancelot will give his daughter a child and that this little boy will grow to become the greatest knight in the world, the knight chosen by God to discover the [[Holy Grail]]. Pelles also knows that Lancelot will only lie with his one true love, Guinevere. Destiny will have to be helped along a little; therefore, a conclusion which prompts Pelles to seek out "one of the greatest enchantresses of the time," Dame Brusen, who gives Pelles a magic ring that will make Elaine take on the appearance of Guinevere. Lancelot and Elaine sleep together, but on discovering the deception, Lancelot then gets his clothes on and runs, leaving Elaine, but when he finds out that they have conceived a son together, he is immediately forgiving; however, he does not marry Elaine or even wish to be with her anymore and returns to Arthur's court. The young Galahad is born and placed in the care of a great aunt, who is an abbess at a nunnery, to be raised there.

According to the 13th-century Old French [[Prose Lancelot]] (part of the Vulgate Cycle), "Galahad" was Lancelot's original name, but it was changed when he was a child. At his birth, therefore, Galahad is given his father's own original name. [[Merlin]] prophesies that Galahad will surpass his father in valor and be successful in his search for the Holy Grail. Pelles, Galahad's maternal grandfather, is portrayed as a descendant of Bron, [[Joseph of Arimathea]]'s brother-in-law, whose line was entrusted with the Grail by Joseph.

===Knighthood and the Grail Quest===
[[File:Galahad grail detail.jpg|thumb|Sir Galahad in a tapestry by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] (c. 1894)|208x208px|left]]
[[File:326 The Romance of King Arthur.jpg|thumb|"How Galahad drew out the sword from the floating stone at Camelot." [[Arthur Rackham]]'s illustration for [[Alfred W. Pollard]]'s ''The Romance of King Arthur'' (1917)]]

Upon reaching adulthood, Galahad is reunited with his father Lancelot, who knights him. Galahad is then brought to King Arthur's court at [[Camelot]] during [[Pentecost]], where he is accompanied by a very old knight who immediately leads him over to the [[Round Table]] and unveils his seat at the [[Siege Perilous]], an unused chair that has been kept vacant for the sole person who will succeed in the quest of the Holy Grail. For all others who have aspired to sit there, it has proved to be immediately fatal. Galahad survives this test, witnessed by Arthur who, upon realizing the greatness of this new knight, leads him out to the river where a sword lies in a stone with an inscription reading "Never shall man take me hence but only he by whose side I ought to hang; and he shall be the best knight of the world." (The embedding of a sword in a stone is also an element of the legends of Arthur's original sword, [[Excalibur|the sword in the stone]].) Galahad accomplishes this test with ease, and Arthur swiftly proclaims him to be the greatest knight ever. Galahad is promptly invited to become a Knight of the Round Table, and soon afterwards, Arthur's court witnesses an ethereal vision of the Grail. The quest to seek out this holy object is begun at once.

All of the Knights of the Round Table set out to find the Grail.&lt;ref&gt;Vinaver, Eugene, 1971. ''Malory: Works''. Oxford University Press. ''The Tale of the Sankgreal, Briefly Drawn out of French, which is a Tale Chronicled for One of the Truest and one of the Holiest that is in this World''. 1. "The Departure". pp. 515–524.&lt;/ref&gt; It is Galahad who takes the initiative to begin the search for the Grail; the rest of the knights follow him. Arthur is sorrowful that all the knights have embarked thus, for he discerns that many will never be seen again, dying in their quest. Arthur fears that it is the beginning of the end of the Round Table. This might be seen as a theological statement that concludes that earthly endeavors must take second place to the pursuit of the holy. Galahad, in some ways, mirrors Arthur, drawing a sword from a stone in the way that Arthur did. In this manner, Galahad is declared to be the chosen one.

Galahad for the most part travels alone, smiting his enemies, rescuing [[Percival]] from twenty knights and saving maidens in distress, until he is finally reunited with [[Sir Bors|Bors]] and Percival. These three knights then come across Percival's sister, who leads them to the grail ship. They cross the sea in this ship and when they arrive on a distant shore, Percival's sister is forced to die to save another. Bors departs from the company in order to take her body back to her own country for a proper burial. 

===Ascension to Heaven===
[[File:Edwin Austin Abbey 01.jpg|thumb|Sir Galahad discovers the [[Holy Grail|Grail]] in a 1895 painting by [[Edwin Austin Abbey]] |220x220px|left]]
[[File:Joseph Noel Paton Sir Galahad JKAM.jpg|thumb|''Sir Galahad'' by [[Joseph Noel Paton]]|331x331px]]

After many adventures, Galahad and Percival find themselves at the court of Pelles and Eliazar, his son. These men bring Galahad into a room where he is finally allowed to see the Holy Grail. Galahad is asked to take the vessel to the holy island [[Sarras]]. After seeing the Grail, Galahad, however, makes the request that he may die at the time of his choosing. So it is, while making his way back to Arthur's court, Galahad is visited by Joseph of Arimathea, and thus experiences such glorious rapture that he makes his request to die. Galahad bids Percival and Bors farewell, and angels take him to Heaven, an [[Ascension (mystical)|ascension]] witnessed by Bors and Percival. While it is not explicit that the Holy Grail is never to be seen again on earth, it is stated (in Malory's ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'') that there has since then been no knight capable of obtaining it.

Galahad's success in the high religious endeavor that was the search for the Holy Grail was predicted before his birth, not only by Pelles but by Merlin: Merlin had told [[Uther Pendragon]] that there was one who would fill the place at the “table of Joseph”, but that he was not yet born. At first this knight was believed to be Perceval; however it is later discovered to be Galahad. Galahad's conception is later glossed by Malory: "And so by enchantment [Elaine] won the love of Lancelot, and certainly she loved him again passing well.” Galahad was conceived for the divine purpose of seeking the Holy Grail.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Arthur. The Holy Grail: The Galahad Quest in the Arthurian Literature. New York: University Books, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; But Galahad's conception happened through pure deceit; under a cloak of deception that was very similar, in fact, to that which led to the conception of Arthur and of Merlin himself. Despite this, Galahad is the knight who is chosen to find the Holy Grail. Galahad, in the ''Lancelot-Grail cycle'' and in Malory's retelling, is exalted above all the other knights; he is the one worthy enough to have the Holy Grail revealed to him and to be taken into heaven.

==Victorian portrayals==
===Alfred, Lord Tennyson===
[[File:Sir Galahad Victoria College Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Galahad by [[Alfred Turner (sculptor)|Alfred Turner]] with quotation from [[Tennyson]] and list of fallen [[Old Victorians]]; [[World War I]] memorial at [[Victoria College, Jersey]]]]

In Sir Thomas Malory's ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Galahad's incredible prowess and fortune in the quest for the Holy Grail are traced back to his piety. According to the legend, only pure knights may achieve the Grail. While in a specific sense, this "purity" refers to chastity, Galahad appears to have lived a generally sinless life and so as a result, he lives and thinks on a level entirely apart from the other knights around him. This quality is reflected in [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s poem "Sir Galahad":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;My good blade carves the casques of men,
My tough lance thrusteth sure,
My strength is as the strength of ten,
Because my heart is pure.&lt;ref name=Tennysonpp181-2&gt;Tennyson, Alfred Lord: Wordsworth Poetry Library, 1994. ''The Works of Alfred Lord Tennyson''. Wordsworth Editions Limited. ''Sir Galahad'', published 1834. pp. 181–182. Beginning of the first stanza. [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/Galahad.htm Camelot Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Galahad is able to conquer all of his enemies because he is pure. In the next verse of this poem, Tennyson continues to glorify Galahad for remaining pure at heart, by putting these words into his mouth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I never felt the kiss of love,
Nor maiden's hand in mine.&lt;ref name=Tennysonpp181-2/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sir Galahad pursues a single-minded and lonely course, sacrificing much in his determination to aspire to a higher ideal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Then move the trees, the copses nod,
Wings flutter, voices hover clear
"O just and faithful knight of God!
Ride on! the prize is near."&lt;ref name=Tennysonpp181-2/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tennyson's poem follows Galahad's journey to find the Holy Grail but ends while he is still riding, still seeking, still dreaming; as if to say that the quest for the Holy Grail is an ongoing task. Unlike many other portrayals of the legend of Sir Galahad, Tennyson has Sir Galahad speak in the first person, gives the reader his thoughts and feelings as he rides on his quest, rather than just the details of his battles, as in Malory.

===William Morris===
Sir Galahad's thoughts and aspirations have been explored as well by William Morris in his poem ''Sir Galahad, a Christmas Mystery'',&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Galahad, a Christmas Mystery'' [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/morrgal.htm Camelot Project]&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1858. In this poem, written more than twenty years after Tennyson's ''Sir Galahad'', Galahad is "fighting an internal battle between the ideal and the human," believing that he is like God and that he is able to be a "saviour capable of imparting grace,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevenson |first1=Catherine Barnes |last2=Hale |first2=Virginia |year=2000 |title=Medieval Drama and Courtly Romance in William Morris' 'Sir Galahad, A Christmas Mystery' |journal=Victorian Poetry |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=383–91 |doi=10.1353/vp.2000.0038}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a dream in which he saves a dying knight with a kiss. Galahad isolates himself because he is a “self-centred figure".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Morris’ poem places this emotional conflict at centre stage, rather than concentrating upon Galahad’s prowess for defeating external enemies, and the cold and the frost of a Christmas period serve to reinforce his "chilly isolation".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The poem opens on midwinter's night; Sir Galahad has been sitting for six hours in a chapel, staring at the floor. He muses to himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Night after night your horse treads down alone
The sere damp fern, night after night you sit
Holding the bridle like a man of stone,
Dismal, unfriended: what thing comes of it?&lt;ref&gt;Morris, William. 1858. ''Sir Galahad, A Christmas Mystery''. [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/morrgal.htm Camelot Project] Sixth stanza.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Twentieth century and later==
===Literature===
* A poem by Thomas de Beverly published in 1925, "The Birth of Sir Galahad", tells of the events leading up to the conception of Sir Galahad, his birth and a visit soon afterwards by Sir Bors, to see Elaine and the baby Galahad. Sir Bors sees a vision of the Holy Grail whilst in a chapel with the baby and his mother. Of the three knights who are untainted by sin – Sir Perceval, Sir Bors, and Sir Galahad – Galahad is the only one predestined to achieve this honor of attaining the Holy Grail. &lt;ref&gt;Thomas de Beverly. 1925. ''The Birth of Galahad''. [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/TDGalahad.htm Camelot Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Alec Warner noted the similarity with God declaring that [[King David]] had shed much blood and was not worthy of building the [[Jerusalem Temple]], this honour falling only to his son [[King Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]], Ch. 22, 8, - quoted in Alec G. Warner, ''Biblical Motives in Twentieth Century Literature" in Barbara Kid (ed.) "New Essays on British and American Literature", New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Edmund Wilson's story "Galahad", published in 1927, presents a humorous story about the attempted seduction of a virginal high school student by a debutante.
* In [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]]'s novel ''Galahad: Enough of His Life to Explain His Reputation'', Galahad’s main tutor for his knightly training is not his father Lancelot or King Arthur, but in fact Queen Guinevere. Erskine follows Malory’s text through Galahad’s childhood. Just as in ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', Galahad grows up in the court of his mother Elaine and travels to King Arthur’s court to be reunited with his father and to become a knight. When Galahad arrives at the court, Guinevere is upset with Lancelot because he does not want to be her lover anymore and she takes an interest in the young knight, persuading him to go above and beyond regular knightly duties. At first Galahad seems content with just being an ordinary Knight of the Round Table, going out on quests and saving maidens in distress. Guinivere is the main contributor to Galahad’s destiny in this work. She says “you’ll waste your life if you don’t accomplish something new, something entirely your own".&lt;ref&gt;Erskine 192&lt;/ref&gt; This is Galahad’s motivation to seek the Grail.
* [[Matt Cohen (writer)|Matt Cohen]] satirises Galahad’s virtuous character in his short story ''Too Bad Galahad''. Cohen describes Galahad as the “perfect knight” who does no harm. In part, “Galahad’s virtue is a compensation for Lancelot’s indiscretion". However, Cohen, instead of glorifying Galahad's virtuous character, makes it into a weakness. He writes that Galahad tried to “swear and kill and wench with the rest of the knights but he could never really get into it". Cohen's Galahad is not well liked by the other knights because he is so perfect and seems unapproachable. Cohen pokes fun at Galahad's “calling” by saying that his life would be wasted if he failed to remain pure and holy in order to be the bearer of the Holy Grail.
* [[Thomas Berger (novelist)|Thomas Berger's]] ''Arthur Rex'' portrays Galahad differently. In most works, Galahad is depicted as an emblem of perfection. Berger shows Galahad’s arrival to court in a more satirical light. [[Gawain]] comments that he cannot tell whether he is male or female. Berger shows that even though Galahad is in fact the greatest knight in the world, he does not appear to be. Appearance versus reality is a common theme throughout this novel. In most versions of the story of Sir Galahad, Galahad's death comes about after his greatest achievement, that of the Holy Grail. In ''Arthur Rex'', however, Galahad is killed in a battle where he mistakes his own father Lancelot for a Saxon. Galahad is too weak and sleeps through most of the battle and, when he does wake up, he kills his father as well as being killed himself. Just like the Grail, perfection is unattainable; only glimpses of the Grail and of perfection can be seen.
* In the ''[[Everworld]]'' fantasy novel series written by [[K. A. Applegate]], the character David Levin fights with the Sword of Galahad, after witnessing Sir Galahad's death. David is the self-appointed leader of the protagonists and takes on all the burdens of the group, being troubled by his past in which he was cowardly and feeling he must prove himself to be a man - in which could be seen some parallels with Galahad's life.
* In [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel ''[[We the Living]]'' the character Andrei Taganov, an honest and idealistic revolutionary Communist, sacrifices his career and resorts to blackmail in order to save the life of Leo, the lover of Kira—the woman that Andrei loves; though hating Leo and intensely jealous of him, Andrei puts Kira's happiness before his own. The villain Pavel Syerov calls Andrei in derision "Sir Galahad of the blackmail sword";&lt;ref&gt;[[Ayn Rand]], ''[[We the Living]]'', Part Two, Ch. KIV.&lt;/ref&gt; thereupon, Andrei accepts the comparison as appropriate.
* Knight Galaad of Caer Benic, working for King Arthur, appears in ''[[The Lady of the Lake (Sapkowski novel)|The Lady of the Lake]]'', the final last book of ''[[The Witcher]]'' saga by [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]. At the very beginning of the story, as a denizen of a parallel world, encounters Cirilla of Cintra and calls her the Lady of the Lake.

===Music===
* [[Joan Baez]] uses the legend metaphorically in her song "[[Sweet Sir Galahad]]", which is about the courtship of her sister.
* The band [[America (band)|America]] mentions Galahad ("... or the tropic of Sir Galahad") in the chorus for the song "[[Tin Man (America song)|Tin Man]]".
* On his EP ''[[To the Yet Unknowing World (EP)|To the Yet Unknowing World]]'', [[Josh Ritter]] has a song titled "Galahad", which jokes about Galahad's chastity and the 'virtue' of his supposed purity.

===Film and television===
* Galahad is portrayed by [[Michael Palin]] in ''[[Monty Python and The Holy Grail]]''. His chastity and purity is put to the test when he finds a castle full of sexually charged nuns.
* Galahad is portrayed by [[Hugh Dancy]] in the 2004 action adventure ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.
* [[John Larroquette]] played an elderly, yet immortal Galahad (now known as Jenkins) in the TV series ''[[The Librarians (2014 TV series)|The Librarians]]''.
* A Knightmare frame that is piloted by the Knight of One, Bismarck Waldstein, is named Galahad from the anime ''[[Code Geass]]''.
* In the film ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]'' Galahad is the code name of [[Colin Firth]]'s character Harry Hart.

===Games===
* In the video game ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]'', Galahad is a Heroic Spirit that was fused with a girl, making the Demi-Servant Mash Kyrielight, under the class of Shielder.
* In the 2015 video game ''[[The Order: 1886]]'', the main character is an heir to the title of Sir Galahad, and is therefore referred to as such.
* The living card game ''[[Android: Netrunner]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/06011 Fantasy Flight Games]&lt;/ref&gt; features a card named Galahad. It belongs to a sub-category of [[Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics]] called "Grail," to which [[Lancelot]], [[Merlin]], and [[Excalibur]] also belong.
* The board game ''Shadows Over Camelot'' features Sir Galahad as one of the characters players can select. 
* He is also represented by [[Silver the Hedgehog]] in ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]''.

The '''{{lang|de|Gesellschaft der Freunde alter Musikinstrumente}}''' ('''GEFAM''') (''Society of friends of old [[musical instruments]]'') was founded in 1951 in [[Zurich]], Switzerland, by a number of music lovers and collectors of historical musical instruments. It is still the only society in the German speaking part of Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Lichtenstein) that is concerned mainly with old musical instruments. Thanks to its base in Switzerland it has a multicultural and multilanguage profile, visual in its international list of members. Today there are around 200 members (individuals and institutions), mainly in Europe, but also on other parts of the globe. The spectrum includes specialised museums and collections of old musical instruments, researchers and instrument makers as well as private collectors and enthusiasts.

The society is a forum in which public and private collections of musical instruments are visited and aspects of conservation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/musik-und-artenschutz-im-clinch-1.18435496&lt;/ref&gt; are discussed, whereby the history of the musical instruments is given special consideration. Occasionally extra-European instruments are regarded as well. In addition to these aspects the society also contributes to discussions between [[museum]] "[[Expert|specialists]]"&lt;!-- what is being quoted here? --&gt;{{cn|date=August 2015}}, [[Musical instrument|instrument makers]], [[universities]] and [[Music school|conservatories]] on the one hand and [[Private collection|private collectors]] and others interested in old musical instruments on the other.

==Publications==

The society publishes the biannual bulletin ''[[Glareana]]'' ([http://www.gefam.ch/en/glareana_en/ eJournal])&lt;ref&gt;Imogen Fellinger, et al. "Periodicals." Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 12 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/21338pg41&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with society news and articles on subjects pertaining to instruments. It has also published several [[monograph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gefam.ch/en/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

“Grade retention” or “grade repetition” is the process of a kindergarten through twelfth grade student repeating the same grade due to failing it the previous year, these students are referred to as "repeaters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/repeater] Definition of repeater, accessed January 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Repeaters can also be referred to as having been "held back". Students do not necessarily repeat in the same [[classroom]], only the same grade.

The alternative to grade retention due to failing is a policy of [[social promotion]], with the idea that staying within their same age group is important. Social promotion is the obligatory advancement of all students regardless of achievements and absences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/social%20promotion.html social promotion definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta], accessed June 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Social promotion is used more in countries which use [[tracking (education)|tracking]] to group students according to academic ability. Academic scholars believe that underperformance must be addressed with intensive remedial help, such as [[summer school]] programs in contrast to failing and retaining the student.

In most countries, grade retention has been banned or strongly discouraged. In the [[United States]], grade retention can be used in kindergarten through twelfth grade, however, students in grades seven through twelve are usually only retained in the specific failed subject due to each subject having its own specific classroom rather than staying in one classroom with all subjects taught for the entire school day as it is in grades kindergarten through sixth grade. For example, in grades seven through twelve, a student can be promoted in a math class but retained in a language class. Single classroom grades kindergarten through sixth grade are confined to one room for the whole day, being taught all subjects in the same classroom usually by one teacher with the exception of art and gymnastics conducted in the art room and the gymnasium respectively. In these grades the student must generally fail or score well below the accepted level in most or all areas within the entire curriculum to be retained. The student will then again repeat the entire school year within a single classroom and repeating the same subject matter as the previous year.

Where it is permitted, grade retention is most common among students in early elementary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6807(199707)34:3%3C219::AID-PITS4%3E3.0.CO;2-J/abstract|title = Predicting early school success with developmental and social skills screeners|last = McKee Agostin|first = Tracy|date = July 1997|journal = Psychology in the Schools|doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-6807(199707)34:3&lt;219::AID-PITS4&gt;3.0.CO;2-J|pmid = |access-date =|volume=34|pages=219–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students with [[intellectual disabilities]] are only retained when parents and school officials agree to do so. Children who are relatively young in their age cohort are four times more likely to be retained.&lt;ref name="RAdutch"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jeronimus B.F.|author2=Stavrakakis, N.|author3=Veenstra, R.|author4= Oldehinkel, A.J.| year = 2015 | title = Relative Age Effects in Dutch Adolescents: Concurrent and Prospective Analyses | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e0128856 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128856 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0128856 | pmid=26076384 | pmc=4468064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Different schools have used different approaches throughout history. Grade retention or repetition was essentially meaningless in the [[one-room school]]houses of more than a century ago due to limited access to outside standards and the small scale of the school with only a few students in each age group, was conducive to individualized instruction. With the proliferation of larger, graded schools in the middle of the nineteenth century, retention became a common practice and only one century ago, about half of all American students were retained at least once before the age of thirteen.&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rose |first=Janet S. |title=A Fresh Look at the Retention-Promotion Controversy |journal=Journal of School Psychology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=201–211 |year=1983 |doi=10.1016/0022-4405(83)90015-8 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social promotion]] began to spread in the 1930s with concerns about the psychosocial effects of retention.&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;  Social promotion is the promoting of [[underachiever|underperforming]] students under the ideological principle that staying with their same age peers is important to success. This trend reversed in the 1980s as concerns about slipping academic standards rose, and the practice of grade retention in the United States has been climbing steadily ever since.&lt;ref name="Leckrone &amp; Griffith"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leckrone |first=M. J. |first2=B. G. |last2=Griffith |year=2006 |title=Retention Realities and Educational Standards |journal=Children &amp; Schools |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=53–58 |doi=10.1093/cs/28.1.53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of making retention decisions on the basis of the results of a single test called [[high-stakes testing]] is widely condemned by professional educators.&lt;ref name="Goldberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldberg |first=M. |year=2005 |title=Losing Students to High-Stakes Testing |journal=Education Digest |volume=70 |issue=7 |pages=10–19 |issn=0013-127X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=National Association of School Psychologists |year=2002 |title=Large scale assessments and high stakes decisions: Facts, cautions, and guidelines |url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/factsheets/highstakes_fs.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; Test authors generally advise that their tests are not adequate for high stakes decisions, and that decisions should be made based on all the facts and circumstances.&lt;ref name="Goldberg" /&gt;

==Research==
{{refimprove section|reason=“Only one source is used, and it’s really outdated.”|date=December 2018}}
There is conclusive evidence that grade retention is significantly helpful, and much of the existing research has been methodologically invalid &lt;ref name="titleGrade Retention and Promotion"/&gt;due to the selection bias in the group allocation phase.  The three different types of studies that exist or have been proposed have inherent pitfalls to overcome before the resulting data can be deemed as accurate.
# Studies that compare students who were retained with students who were only considered for retention and were eventually promoted, concluded that social promotion is beneficial to the students. The students that were selected for promotion were often viewed as “better”, or “less weak” than the students that were retained, and the “better” students were selected for promotion “because the school believed them to be stronger or more personally mature students”, whereas the students that were selected for retention were viewed as “weaker” students and were retained as a result of this.&lt;ref name="titleGrade Retention and Promotion"/&gt;
# Studies that compare retained students with their own prior performance seem to favor grade retention, however, these studies are inaccurate because they do not adequately compensate for personal growth, or stressful changes at home like abusive living conditions, or drastic environmental issues such as living in poverty; all of which will have a definitive impact on the students performance.&lt;ref name="titleGrade Retention and Promotion"/&gt;
# Studies which randomly assign a large pool of borderline students to promotion or retention is the most methodologically sound type of research of this topic. It is imperative that the research is provided with sufficiently detailed information on a large enough scale in order to provide valuable or possibly even definitive information. Although this method can potentially provide the most accurate results, schools and parents are unwilling to have a childs future determined by random assignment, therefore, due to institutional and parental opposition, along with other ethical reasons, these types of studies are not utilized.&lt;ref name="titleGrade Retention and Promotion"/&gt;

'”Non-academic outcomes:”'
Retention is commonly associated with poor social adjustment, disruptive behavior, negative attitudes towards school and low academic attendance."&lt;ref&gt;Mims, K., R. Stock, &amp; C. Phinizy (2001) "Beyond grade retention." In “eJournal of education policy”. At http://jep.csus.edu/journal2001/journals.aspx?id=101 ¶2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Mims refers to a paper by Amy Wells at http://www.ericdigests.org/pre-9213/middle.htm, who cites "Before It's Too Late" by Anne Wheelock at Massachusetts Advocacy Center for her information.  Wheelock read the actual studies. --&gt; Retention is a "stronger predictor of delinquency than socioeconomic status, race, or ethnicity," and is also a strong predictor of drug and alcohol use and teenage pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Leckrone &amp; Griffith"/&gt;{{rp|54–55}}

==International==

===Australia and New Zealand===
[[Australia]] uses grade retention, although in 2010 the [[New South Wales Department of Education and Training]] enacted a policy that states that student retention will no longer be allowed at any school. For example, as of 2010, students will not be repeating [[Eleventh grade|eleventh grade]] or [[Twelfth grade|twelfth grade]] due to the abundance of post school services available to them after they complete twelfth grade, services such as [[TAFE]]s or [[University|college universities]].

In [[New Zealand]], secondary schools commonly use a system of internal academic streaming in which children of the same age are subdivided on the basis of ability, and lower achieving students (those who would be retained under the North American system) are taught in different classes, and at a different rate, from higher achieving students, but are kept within their own age group. This system has largely rendered grade retention obsolete in all but the most exceptional circumstances. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In most cases where academic streaming is insufficient, additional special services are viewed as being preferential to grade retention, particularly when behavioral challenges are involved.

===Argentina===
Argentina contemplates grade retention in all grades except first grade and the last course of high school. In Elementary school students are retained when they fail one of the basic areas: math, language and social sciences. In secondary school, students are allowed a maximum of two courses failed in order to be promoted. If they fail three or more, they should repeat.

===Asia===
[[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Malaysia]] and [[North Korea]] do not practice grade retention.

[[Singapore]] practices grade retention in secondary schools if a student is unsuccessful in achieving a satisfactory accumulated percentage grade. The school authorities may also decide that it would be more appropriate for the student to advance to a higher level in a lower stream such as in the cases of Express and Normal (Academic) students. Grade retention is most common in Junior Colleges where a promotional criteria is set in place. [[Hong Kong]] practices grade retention in elementary and secondary school if the student obtains a failing grade even after taking a retest, though grade retention is very rare.

===Europe===
[[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] do not allow grade retention during elementary school and junior high school (1-10th grade)

In the [[United Kingdom]], a similar streaming system to [[New Zealand]]'s is used (see above).

[[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Austria]], [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Finland]] and [[Switzerland]] use grade retention.

[[Greece]] allows grade retention if a student fails more than 5 final exams, or 5 or less both in May examinations and in September examination. A student who has missed more than 114 periods of class can also repeat a grade.

===North America===
The United States and Canada both use grade retention.

In the U.S., six year old students are most likely to be retained, with another spike around the age of 12.&lt;ref name="titleGrade Retention and Promotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ericae.net/edo/ED267899.htm |title=Grade Retention and Promotion., Steiner, Karen |accessdate=2008-01-28 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some large schools have a transitional classroom, sometimes called "Kindergarten 2", for six year olds who are not reading ready.

School officials in some US states have the authority to allow students to be held back if they do not attend [[summer school]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/nyregion/11summer.html?ref=education |title=More New York City Students to Face Summer School - NYTimes.com | work=The New York Times | first=Jennifer | last=Medina | date=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common arguments==
The following are common arguments regarding this practice.

===Arguments against===
Opponents of "no social promotion" policies do not defend social promotion so much as say that retention is even worse.  They argue that retention is not a cost effective response to poor performance when compared to cheaper or more effective interventions, such as additional tutoring and summer school.  They point to a wide range of research findings that show no advantage to, or even harm from, retention, and the tendency for gains from retention to wash out.

Harm from retention cited by these critics include:
* May lower the [[self esteem]] of the student and make them feel as if they were mentally inferior and in turn cause them to give up on their academics. It may also cause them to be the subject of [[Ridiculous|ridicule]] and [[bullying]] by other students.
* Increased drop out rates of retained students over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bridgeland, J., DiIulio, Jr., J. J., &amp; Balfanz, R. (2009).  Perspectives of teachers and principals on the high school dropout problem. Washington, DC: Civic Enterprises, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;
* No evidence of long term academic benefit for retained students.
* Increased rates of dangerous behaviors such as drinking, drug abuse, crime, sexual promiscuity, teenage pregnancy, depression, and suicide among retained students as compared with similarly performing promoted students.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
* Danger to normally progressing younger students in the class which the older student is required to repeat, when the intellectually challenged older student is likely to possess a great level of physical development.

Critics of retention also note that retention is expensive for school systems: requiring a student to repeat a grade is essentially to add one student for a year to the school system, assuming that the student does not drop out.

The possibility of grade retention has been shown to be a significant source of stress for students. In one study of childhood fears performed in the 1980s, the top three{{clarify|reason=As determined how?:  From a list of selected items?  By open ended response without options or prompts?|date=December 2016}}   fears for US sixth graders were a parent's death, going blind, and being retained. After two decades of increasing retention practices, a repeat of the study in 2001 found that grade retention was the single greatest fear, higher than loss of a parent or going blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.naspcenter.org/principals/nasp_retent.pdf|author1=Shane R. Jimerson |author2=Sarah M. Woehr |author3=Amber M. Kaufman | year=2002 |title= Grade retention: Achievement and mental health outcomes |format=PDF | work= National Association of School Psychologists}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This change likely reflects the students correct perception that they were statistically far more likely to repeat the sixth grade than to suffer the death of a parent or the loss of their vision.

===Arguments for===
Opponents of social promotion argue that passing a child who did not learn the necessary material cheats the child of an education.  As a result, when the child gets older, the student will likely fail classes or be forced to attend summer school. Opponents of social promotion argue that some children would benefit from an additional year, especially in Kindergarten, to mature and develop social and emotional skills. This additional time will assist students with improved academic performance.
Opponents of social promotion argue that it has the following negative impacts:
* Students who are promoted cannot do the work in the next grade, and so are being set up for further failure.
* Students will have many failures in the high school years, which will most likely lead to dropping out.
* It sends the message to all students that they can get by without working hard.
* It forces teachers to deal with under prepared students while trying to teach the prepared.
* It gives parents a false sense of their childrens progress.
* It will not get them the help they need.
* Florida, the first state to end social promotion in third grade, now has the highest reading scores in the nation for disadvantaged fourth grade students according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

'''''Hollow Man 2''''' is a 2006 American [[science fiction]] [[Horror film|horror]] film directed by [[Claudio Fäh]] and starring [[Peter Facinelli]], [[Laura Regan]] and [[Christian Slater]]. It is the stand-alone sequel to the film ''[[Hollow Man]]''. It was released [[direct-to-video]] on May 23, 2006.

==Plot==
The movie opens at a cocktail party at the Reisner Institute, a Washington [[think tank]], some time after the events of the first movie. An invisible force drags a scientist named Dylan into a nearby bathroom, where the force (implied to be a person) brutally throws Dylan around for information. Dylan mentions another scientist, Maggie Dalton, who knows the "formula" the invisible person is looking for. Apparently accepting this, the invisible person releases him, warning him not to tell anyone he was there. As soon as the invisible man leaves (or rather, pretends to leave),  Dylan attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man smashes the phone and slashes Dylan's throat. The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct a murder investigation, but the laboratory's military supervisor, Colonel Gavin Bishop, insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction. Fearing attacks on the remaining scientists, the lab's owner, Dr. William Reisner, employs Frank Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez, to protect Maggie, but refuses to divulge any information on the nature of his work.

The two detectives stand guard outside Maggie's house. When Lisa opens the door to let the cat in, the invisible man sneaks past her into the house. Just as he reaches the study where Maggie is, Lisa tracks him down, and he kills her with a lamp's power cord. Suddenly, armed military commandos appear and storm the house, using thermal goggles to target and corner the invisible man. Outside, Turner confronts Bishop, realizing that they used him and Lisa to lure the invisible man to the house. Several [[stun grenades]] go off around the house, incapacitating the soldiers and allowing the invisible man to escape in pursuit of Turner and Maggie. He almost catches up to them, but is struck and badly injured by a car, and flees.

Maggie is taken into protective custody by the police, where Turner's superior and friend, Captain Tom Harrison, has received orders to have her transferred to military custody. Frank helps Maggie escape from the police station and they flee in a stolen car. Bishop and Reisner, knowing their careers would end if Maggie talks, declare them fugitives.

Maggie later tells Turner that [[Hollow Man|five years prior, a team of scientists figured out how to make humans invisible, but something went wrong, leaving only two survivors]]. A year after the original project was scrapped, the Reisner Institute restarted the experiments as a covertly [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]-funded operation to create the perfect soldier, codenamed "Silent Knight", which attempts to render humans invisible. The resulting [[drug|serum]] ''does'' turn human tissue invisible, but with [[adverse effect]]s: as it allows light to pass directly through the subject, the [[radiation]] damages the cells and causes physical and mental degradation, slowly killing the person. Maggie developed a compound called the "Buffer" to counteract the effects of that particular radiation. A soldier named Michael Griffin volunteered, and the serum succeeded, but the Buffer failed and Griffin seemingly died, which in turn got Maggie fired. Maggie believes that Griffin faked his death so he could use his powers without restraint, but now needs the [[antidote]] to the radiation before he dies.

Maggie receives a message from a man named Ludlow, who has been in contact with her for weeks. Turner uses his contacts to find Ludlow, a soldier enlisted into the program after [[Hollow Man#Cast|Sebastian Caine]] (the original guinea pig), but before Griffin. He had gone into hiding, but is now slowly dying from radiation. Ludlow has also been tracking Griffin, and reveals the true story to his supposed "death" and the program itself: Operation Silent Knight was ''never'' about national security, and neither was Griffin given the Buffer, since they{{who|date=May 2014}} used him to assassinate their political enemies.

Meanwhile, Griffin infiltrates Bishop's office and both get into a fight. The latter attempts to reason with him and then, getting desperate, stabs him with a pen (non-fatally). Griffin impales Bishop with the same pen, and uses his computer to locate Ludlow. Arriving at the hideout, Griffin attacks Turner, but Ludlow intervenes, sacrificing himself to allow Turner and Maggie to escape. Griffin decides to make them return by capturing Maggie's sister. When they meet at the train station where he is hiding, Griffin silently catches Maggie and tries to turn her invisible so he can take her unnoticed, but Turner intervenes. After a short fight, Griffin escapes with Maggie, leaving Turner with the arriving Reisner and his guards. A short time later, Reisner pursues an invisible man, but is soon captured and held by him. Believing him to be Griffin, he offers to send for the Buffer. The figure, however, is ''Turner'', who used Griffin's discarded syringe to become invisible as well. Reisner, backing away, is hit and killed by a speeding car.

Griffin takes Maggie to her old college laboratory to create the Buffer for him. Griffin forces her to inject herself with it first, then injects himself with another dose. With his survival seemingly assured, Griffin tries to kill Maggie, but Turner intervenes and knocks him out of the laboratory window. Turner runs outside, where Griffin renders him unconscious. As Griffin slowly turns visible, Maggie reveals that he has been poisoned, as the vial contained [[rat poison]]; she loses consciousness. Enraged, Griffin takes a shovel and attempts to kill her, but Turner, having recovered, stops him and kills him with the shovel. He then carries Maggie away for medical attention, leaving Griffin's body outside in the rain.

A few days later, Maggie is recovering in hospital and is poised to be released. Heather tells her that Turner has not been found. Maggie insists that he will come back to her, as she knows he needs her. Outside, they are being watched by a hooded invisible man, presumably Turner, who then walks away.

==Production==
===Writing===
''Hollow Man 2'' is based on the very first draft of the Paul Verhoeven film.

The script includes a lot of references to the novel ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]], including the naming of Griffin, which is the same as Wells' invisible man. Also during the final battle between the two Hollow Men, Turner kills Griffin with a shovel, in H. G. Wells' ''The Invisible Man'', Griffin is beaten to death with objects also including a shovel.

===Special effects===
There were only 250 visual effects shots in the whole film, and 80 of them were simply wire removals.

==Release==
The film was released direct-to-video on May 23, 2006. Along with the film, the DVD also included the "Inside Hollow Man 2" featurette, a visual effects featurette and storyboards.
In 2013 [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] released the film for the first time on Blu-ray in a 2 pack set along with the original ''Hollow Man''; all extras were dropped for the Blu-ray release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millcreekent.com/hollow-man-hollow-man-2-bd-double-feature.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213032911/http://www.millcreekent.com/hollow-man-hollow-man-2-bd-double-feature.html |archivedate=2014-12-13 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and reviews==
''Hollow Man 2'', as a direct-to-video release, had lower expectations than its preceding film. Its reviews have been almost uniformly negative; some reviews at best indicate it as average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackasscritics.com/movie.php?movie_key=852|title=Jackass Critics - Hollow Man 2|website=Jackasscritics.com|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] chronicles only a few reviews, all of which designate the film as "rotten".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hollow_man_ii/|title=Hollow Man 2|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard Richards''' (born June 10, 1938) is a [[philosophy|philosopher]] of [[Social Science]] who works with the concepts of ''basic cultural structures''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Richards [http://www.howardri.org/Let60.html What the World Needs Now]. Cultural action to transform the basic structures of the modern world is a general concept that unites most of Richards' writing - see: Richards (2014): [http://unboundedorganization.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Chapter-One-Rosario.pdf Unbounded Organization] p. 1 and 8. ''Methods for Transforming the  Structures of the Modern World'' is the subtitle of Vol.II of {{harvnb|Richards|1994}}  ''Letters from Quebec''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''constitutive rules''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;
Constitutive rule, a key concept rooted in the work of [[John Searle]] and [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and in Richards' Oxford tutor [[Rom Harré]]'s rules-oriented approach to the explanation of social behavior. One can find a good description of what Prof Richards understands by ''Constitutive Rules'' in his 2010 speech at the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA)  [http://howardrichards.org/peace4us/humanizing-methodologies-in-transformation/ Humanizing Methodologies in Transformation].&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the title of Research Professor of Philosophy at [[Earlham College]], a [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]], United States, the Quaker School where he taught for thirty years. He officially retired from Earlham College, together with his wife Caroline Higgins in 2007, but retained the title of Research Professor of Philosophy. He has a PhD in Philosophy from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1974}} (Santa Barbara PhD Dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) from the [[Stanford Law School]], an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) from [[Oxford University]] (UK) and a PhD in Educational Planning &lt;ref&gt;With a first field in Curriculum Planning and a second field in [[Applied Psychology]] and [[Moral Education]] with a doctoral thesis on the Chilean PPH (Parents and Children) Project, published as "''The Evaluation of Cultural Action''" ({{harvnb|Richards|1984}}).&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] (OISE), [[University of Toronto]], Canada. He now teaches at the [[University of Santiago, Chile]],&lt;ref&gt;On the doctoral program in [[Management Science]] and the undergraduate program in Ingeneria Comercial (Economics).&lt;/ref&gt; and has ongoing roles at the [[University of South Africa]] (UNISA) &lt;ref&gt;

He is founder of the Peace and Global Studies Program&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The name of the Program has varied over the years from Peace Studies to Peace and Conflict Studies and then, continuing until now, Peace and Global Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of the Business and Nonprofit Management Program at Earlham.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pascalobservatory.org/users/howard-richards Howard Richards] profile.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Howard Richards was born in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. [[California]], United States, the eldest child of Kenneth F. Richards, a truck mechanic, originally from [[Connecticut]], and his wife Donna.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;(McCune)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his mother's intellectual interest in philosophers such as [[Henri Bergson]] which prompted the family to break its ties with [[mormon]]ism. His paternal grandparents fell into unemployment in Connecticut during the [[Great Depression]] and moved to Pasadena in 1932. It was his uncle Jack from his mother's side, who died during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;p 257 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq=howard+richards+uncle+Jack&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b12zT_qO9A&amp;sig=1WNK9Bn5ot8Sft8kvdofeKXL80&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAGoVChMIx8Kol5GyxwIVCTnbCh3KMgfV#v=onepage&amp;q=howard%20richards%20uncle%20Jack&amp;f=false Understanding the Global Economy] and under "The Holocaust" in [http://www.howardri.org/logicalpeaceplan.html Richards], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and especially his mother who fostered his early intellectual interest.&lt;ref&gt;see eg [http://lists.topica.com/lists/CERJ/read/message.html?sort=d&amp;mid=1721114650&amp;start=0 TOPICA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic background==
After graduating from [[Redlands High School]], CA, in June 1956, Richards enrolled in the same year as a Philosophy undergraduate at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Being a top student, he was allowed to skip one year of the normal three year Major in Philosophy course. Afterwards he was admitted  to [[Stanford Law School]] in 1958, graduating with a Juris Doctor ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) degree in 1961. Later in that year he enrolled in graduate school at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], earning an M.A. in Philosophy there in 1964 with a thesis on [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1963}} (MA Philosophy Thesis).&lt;/ref&gt;  Simultaneously he worked at the [[Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions]] think tank where he contributed several articles to the in-house Center Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;a.o. an article entitled  "A normative Economics" - see [http://www.howardri.org/Bib.html Richards Bibliography] Articles.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 he left for Chile, where they ultimately would settle in the town of [[Limache]]. Soon after their arrival, Howard took up the post of Dean of Studies at the [[Santiago College]], (a college in Chile is a secondary school). While in [[Santiago]], Howard joined the Chilean Ministry of Education as an advisor to President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]]'s Educational Reform, working on a Secondary Curriculum influenced by the ideas of the Brazilian Educator [[Paulo Freire]]&lt;ref&gt;CPEIP-MINEDUC -  Centro de Perfeccionamiento, Experimentación e Investigaciones Pedagógicas. Ministerio de la Educación.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1970 Richards and his family left for the UK where Richards enrolled for an Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) at [[Oxford University]], simultaneously doing one on one tutorials and attending seminars by the philosophers [[Rom Harré]] and [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref&gt;See eg [https://books.google.com/books?id=c14UNW298sAC&amp;pg=PA438&amp;lpg=PA438&amp;dq=howard+richards+rom+harre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pmbiSC7QsD&amp;sig=fjosYk8zOkT4JROztTd4-cl2LYU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9qqiVabWHa3d7QacvYOADA&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=howard%20richards%20rom%20harre&amp;f=false Harré], who had a strong influence on Richards' thinking.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with an honors thesis on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;"''The Concept of Causality in the Light of Piaget's Research on the Scientific Thinking of Children''" Thesis, Oxford University, 1973.

Richards and his family left Chile in 1974, after [[Pinochet]]'s 1973 [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|coup d'état]], but not before having helped friends and colleagues escape Pinochet's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] police.&lt;ref&gt;As described in [http://www.biblio.com/sweet-country-by-richards-caroline/work/378047  Sweet Country], a book authored by Howard's wife Caroline and which was later (1987) turned into a [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/23/movies/film-sweet-country.html film of the same name]  (re: ''[[Sweet Country (1987 film)|Sweet Country]]'') by the Greek director [[Michael Cacoyannis]].&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy curriculum Richards had helped develop was repealed shortly after the coup, but was adopted in several other Latin American countries. In September 1974 Richards and his family returned to the USA where he started work at [[Earlham College]] in [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], [[Indiana]]. Later that year he successfully defended his doctoral thesis in Philosophy at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], having done the preparatory work when still in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1974}}  ''Distributive Justice'' Doctoral Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt; While based in Richmond, he attended the [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] Summer School on Moral Education at [[Harvard University]]. Richards became a professor at Earlham College and was the founding director of its [http://www.earlham.edu/peace-and-global-studies/the-program/ Peace and Global Studies] program until 1989 and part-time Director until 2004. Between 1981 and 1985, Richards combined commitments in Richmond with those at [http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise/Home/ OISE, Toronto], with the occasional stay in [[Quebec]] where their daughters were studying at a French-speaking school, he enrolled in another PhD program in Education, with a first field in curriculum planning and a second field in [[applied psychology]] and moral education, at the [[University of Toronto]]'s Institute for Studies in Education (UT/OISE), which he successfully completed with a doctoral thesis based on the Chilean PPH program.&lt;ref&gt;This OISE thesis was published as {{harvnb|Richards|1982}} and translated into English as {{harvnb|Richards|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Beatrice"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0738059385900124|title= The Evaluation of Cultural Action|first=Beatrice|last=Avalos|year=1985|publisher= Int.

==Law practice==
Richards was the first volunteer attorney for [[Cesar Chavez]]'s [[United Farm Workers of America]], protecting the union's funds against grower lawsuits.&lt;ref name="Journal Labor"/&gt;   In 1983 he became member of the American Bankruptcy Institute.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1989 he  started practicing law in Santa Barbara, joining the [http://www.lafsbc.org/ Legal Aid Foundation] and specializing in bankruptcy,&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.nacba.org/ National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys](NACBA).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 he also was a voluntary attorney at the [http://www.lafla.org/ Los Angeles Free Clinic],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justia.com/lawyers/california/goleta?page=2 Justicia] members.&lt;/ref&gt; a practice he wound up in 2004, when he moved back to [[Limache]], Chile.

==Major works and ideas==
* In his first major work, ''The Evaluation of Cultural Action'' (1984),&lt;ref name="RichardsEs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RichardsEn"/&gt; Richards ''"unveils throughout the text the rationale for using an 'illuminative' approach (Parlett and Hamilton, 1974) rather than a conventional 'systems' assessment"''.&lt;ref name="Beatrice"/&gt; The long dialogue with a "reasonable social scientist" gravitates around how to evaluate education and community development efforts inspired by the Brazilian adult educationist [[Paulo Freire]]'s philosophy, combined with an empirical study of one such effort, namely PPH (Parents and Children Program) that flourished among peasants in the south of Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
* Richards' two-volume ''Letters from Quebec: a Philosophy for Peace and Justice'' (1994)  &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1994}}, Bloomberg books, also published by [http://www.gamutbooks.org/cf71y_letters-from-quebec-a-philosophy-for-peace-and-justice-pdf.pdf International Scholars Press, 1996]. ''Letters from Quebec Vol 1 &amp; 2'' can be read online on [https://www.scribd.com/doc/184024951/Howard-Richards-Letters-From-Quebec-vols-1-2-pdf#scribd Scribd].&lt;/ref&gt; aspires to be both literary entertainment and a history of [[rationality]] in western culture and philosophy, illuminating the possibilities for transformative and humanistic action. The subtitle of volume Two of ''Letters from Quebec'' is  'Methods for Transforming the  Structures of the Modern World'. Taking leads from [[Paulo Freire]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], the philosopher is seen - borrowing a phrase from [[Paulo Freire]] - as a 'cultural activist' who invents rationalities.
*  Building on the premise that standards of [[rationality]] are historically [[social construct|constructed]] social norms, he went on, in ''Understanding the Global Economy'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|2004}} (Peace Education Books) was originally published by [https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_the_global_economy.html?id=8yQPAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Maadhyam] in 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; to argue that causal explanations in economics invariably rely, as premises, on cultural norms, and particularly on constitutive rules &lt;ref&gt;"Constitutive rules constitute (and also regulate) an activity the existence of which is logically dependent on the rules." [http://howardrichards.org/peace4us/humanizing-methodologies-in-transformation/ Richards, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; Richards proposes to understand institutions by following out the consequences of the rules that organize them. ''Understanding the Global Economy'' reviews the principal schools of economic thought with respect to the causal explanations they offer of the phenomena of today's global economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Betty Reardon]], ([http://www.howardri.org/reardon.html foreword]).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Dilemmas of Social Democracies: Overcoming Obstacles to a More Just World'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|Swanger|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with Joanna Swanger, applies the philosophical ideas of Richards' earlier works,  particularly a concept of  basic cultural structure,&lt;ref&gt;Basic cultural structure: see eg Richards [http://www.howardri.org/Let60.html What the World Needs Now].&lt;/ref&gt; - where 'basic' identifies those cultural structures that govern the satisfaction of the [[basic needs]] of life  - to historical case studies of Spain,  Sweden,  Austria,  South Africa, Indonesia, Venezuela, and the World Bank. The upshot is that [[social democracy]] is not feasible with the framework provided by the [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kw5vLbYq-4C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=constitutive+rules+richards+howard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b12xUSpKeA&amp;sig=u909sw7jg_vICvEW5_ExayXE9gU&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAmoVChMI1NTNibz4xgIVqZbbCh1ZJQvj#v=onepage&amp;q=constitutive%20rules%20richards%20howard&amp;f=false constitutive rules] of modernity. Social democracy can only become feasible by adopting an approach Richards and another co-author, Gavin Andersson, will later call [http://www.seriti.org.za/index.php/unbounded-organization unbounded organization].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|Richards|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Gandhi and the Future of Economics'' (2011) &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|Swanger|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "makes a case for incorporating [[Gandhi]]'s insights into mainstream economics. ''Gandhi and the Future of Economics'' is not meant to be a research study of Gandhian economics. It is rather that kind of felicitous publication that breathes new life into a known theme, and, in doing so, brings out its implications for [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. It does all this in dialogue with a set of contemporary thinkers and actors from the Indian sub-continent: [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], [[Tariq Ali]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Amartya Sen]], [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Manmohan Singh]]." ([http://liveencounters.net/?page_id=6537 Ivo Coelho]).
*  ''The Nurturing of Time Future'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines itself as "a short book about everything", addressed to educated people of good will who see the need for paradigmatic change. It proposes a philosophy in the old-fashioned sense of articulating a synthesis of the social and natural sciences that provides an overall framework for deciding what to do. It is a '[[belles lettres]]' exercise written in the style of [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smirkingchimp.com/thread/jane-stillwater/43241/america-losing-its-true-moral-compass Jane Stillwater] (review)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rethinking Thinking: Modernity's "Other" and the transformation of the University'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoppers|Richards|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  co-authored with [http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=27341 Catherine Hoppers], further develops  a theme found in early works – that modernity has much to learn from pre-modernity. It includes an account of how the constitutive rules of markets presupposed by economics developed in [[Roman Law]].  They are contrasted with indigenous African cultural norms. ''Rethinking'' also argues that bringing modernity's "other" into the curriculum of the university will transform the curriculum, transform research and transform [[community engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/cpi/article/download/22935/17082 T. Pilay] and [http://www.litnet.co.za/rethinking-thinking-modernitys-other-and-the-transformation-of-the-university/ van der Westhuizen] (reviews).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Richards' most recent book ''Unbounded Organizing in Community'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|Richards|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with Gavin Andersson of South Africa's [http://www.seriti.org.za/ Seriti Institute], offers a combination of a down to earth, practical guide to doing community organizing inspired by the [[Organization Workshop]]s of [[Clodomir Santos de Morais]], with an elementary introduction to Andersson's theory of  [http://www.seriti.org.za/index.php/unbounded-organization unbounded organization]. Emphasis is on practical examples and guidelines for organizers and participants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="913">The '''human dartboard''' is a contemporary [[sideshow]] act in which one person throws [[Dart (missile)|darts]] at another person.  Usually the thrower is the target's assistant or a member of the [[audience]].  This act was popularized by the [[Jim Rose Circus]], where it was performed by Jim, in the role of the target, and his wife Bebe, who threw the darts.  Usually darts are thrown into the back of the target, and the [[vertebral column|spine]] is protected by a board or other long object stuck into the waistband.

'''Leonard Alfred Schneider''' (October 13, 1925 – August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name '''Lenny Bruce''', was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, and satirist. He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an [[obscenity]] trial was followed by a [[Posthumous recognition|posthumous]] pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor [[George Pataki]] in 2003.

Bruce is renowned for paving the way for future outspoken [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture-era]] comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for [[freedom of speech in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/ |title=Lenny Bruce |website=nndb.com |year=2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/nyregion/no-joke-37-years-after-death-lenny-bruce-receives-pardon.html |title=No Joke! 37 Years After Death Lenny Bruce Receives Pardon - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=December 24, 2003 |accessdate=December 5, 2013 |first1=John |last1=Kifner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html |title=Lenny Bruce, Uninhibited Comic, Found Dead in Hollywood Home |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=August 4, 1966 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/arts/24carlin.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Mel | last1=Watkins | first2=Bruce | last2=Weber | title=George Carlin, Comic Who Chafed at Society and Its Constraints, Dies at 71 | date=June 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him third (behind disciples [[Richard Pryor]] and [[George Carlin]]) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

==Early life==
Lenny Bruce was born Leonard Alfred Schneider to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Mineola, New York]], grew up in nearby [[Bellmore, New York|Bellmore]], and attended [[Wellington C. Mepham High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Ly8IAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=lenny+bruce+Wellington+C.+Mepham+High+School&amp;q=Wellington+C.+Mepham+#search_anchor |title=Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!! |page=107 |author1=Albert Goldman |author2=Lawrence Schiller |publisher=Penguin Books |year= 1991 |accessdate=March 31, 2012|isbn=9780140133622 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents divorced before he turned 10 years old, and Lenny lived with various relatives over the next decade. His British-born father, Myron (Mickey) Schneider, was a shoe clerk and Lenny saw him very infrequently. Bruce's mother, [[Sally Marr]] (legal name Sadie Schneider, born Sadie Kitchenberg), was a stage performer and had an enormous influence on Bruce's career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=i3ZcAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Lenny+Bruce%3A+the+making+of+a+prophet&amp;q=Sally+Marr#search_anchor |title=Lenny Bruce: the making of a prophet|page=47 |first=William Karl |last= Thomas |publisher=Archon Books |date= December 1, 1989 |accessdate=March 31, 2012|isbn=9780208022370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After spending time working on a farm, Bruce joined the [[United States Navy]] at the age of 16 in 1942, and saw active duty during [[World War II]] aboard the {{USS|Brooklyn|CL-40}} fighting in Northern Africa; [[Palermo]], Italy, in 1943; and [[Operation Shingle|Anzio]], Italy, in 1944. In May 1945, after a comedic performance for his shipmates in which he was dressed in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]], his commanding officers became upset. He defiantly convinced his ship's medical officer that he was experiencing homosexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;A.H. Goldman. ''Ladies and Gentlemen: Lenny Bruce!!'' (New York: Random House, 1971), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his undesirable discharge in July 1945. However, he had not admitted to or been found guilty of any breach of naval regulations and successfully applied to have his discharge changed to [[Military discharge|"Under Honorable Conditions ... by reason of unsuitability for the naval service"]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/lenny-bruce-navy-records?page=10 "Lenny Bruce's Gay Naval Ruse: Unearthed documents detail comedian's discharge"], [[TheSmokingGun.com]], August 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, while taping the first episode of [[Hugh Hefner]]'s ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'', Bruce talked about his Navy experience and showed a tattoo he received in [[Malta]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0675481/|title="Playboy's Penthouse" Episode #1.1 (TV Episode 1959)|publisher=|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short stint in California spent living with his father, Bruce settled in New York City, hoping to establish himself as a comedian. However, he found it difficult to differentiate himself from the thousands of other show business hopefuls who populated the city. One locale where they congregated was Hanson's, the diner where Bruce first met the comedian Joe Ancis,&lt;ref name="Joe Acis: A Brief Biography"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Driven|first1=Joey|title=Joe Acis: A Brief Biography|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_blogs/artist_893835|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had a profound influence on his approach to comedy. Many of Bruce's later routines reflected his meticulous schooling at the hands of Ancis.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bruce's biographer [[Albert Goldman]], Ancis's humor involved stream-of-consciousness sexual fantasies and references to jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 105-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenny took the stage as "Lenny Marsalle" one evening at the Victory Club, as a stand-in master of ceremonies for one of his mother's shows. His ad-libs earned him some laughs. Soon afterward, in 1947, just after changing his last name to Bruce, he earned $12 and a free spaghetti dinner for his first stand-up performance in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/lenny+bruce|website=Reference.com|accessdate=February 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092400/http://www.reference.com/browse/lenny+bruce|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later a guest—and was introduced by his mother, who called herself "Sally Bruce"—on the ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' radio program. Lenny did a bit inspired by [[Sid Caesar]], "The [[Bavaria]]n Mimic", featuring impressions of American movie stars (e.g., [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], and [[Edward G. Robinson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Ben|title=The Comedy Behind the Tragedy|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-comedy-behind-the-tragedy/Content?oid=917393|website=Chicago Reader|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bruce's early comedy career included writing the screenplays for ''[[Dance Hall Racket]]'' in 1953, which featured Bruce, his wife Honey Harlow, and mother Sally Marr in roles; ''[[Dream Follies]]'' in 1954, a low-budget [[American burlesque|burlesque]] romp; and a children's film, ''[[The Rocket Man (film)|The Rocket Man]]'', in 1954. In 1956 [[Frank Ray Perilli]], a fellow nightclub comedian who eventually became a screenwriter of two dozen successful films and plays, became a mentor and part-time manager of Lenny Bruce.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/candybutcher.htm The Candy Butcher (2016)] p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Perilli, Bruce met and collaborated with photojournalist William Karl Thomas on three screenplays (''Leather Jacket'', ''Killer's Grave'' and ''The Degenerate''), none of which made it to the screen, and the comedy material on the first three albums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/prophet.htm Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet (1989)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 54-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce was a roommate of [[Buddy Hackett]] in the 1950s, they appeared on the ''[[Patrice Munsel|Patrice Munsel Show]]'' (1957–1958), calling their comedy duo the "Not Ready for Prime Time Players,"&lt;ref name="WTF"&gt;{{cite web |title=Episode 966: Sandy Hackett |url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-966-sandy-hackett |website=[[WTF with Marc Maron]] |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20 years before the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live cast members|Saturday Night Live]]'' used the same name. In 1957 Thomas booked Bruce into The Slate Brothers nightclub, where Bruce was fired the first night for what ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' headlined as "blue material"; this led to the theme of Bruce's first solo album on [[Fantasy Records]], ''The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamaestro.net/prophet.htm Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet (1989)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} p. 276-229.&lt;/ref&gt; for which Thomas shot the album cover. Thomas also shot other album covers, acted as cinematographer on abortive attempts to film their screenplays, and in 1989 authored a memoir of their ten-year collaboration titled ''Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamaestro.net/lenny.htm|title=Lenny Bruce: The Making of a Prophet|first=meta tags by William Karl Thomas; web design by William Karl|last=Thomas|website=www.mediamaestro.net|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 biography of Frank Ray Perilli titled ''The Candy Butcher'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamaestro.net/candybutcher.htm|title=The Candy Butcher (2016)|publisher=|accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; devotes a chapter to Perilli's ten-year collaboration with Bruce.

Bruce released a total of four albums of original material on Berkeley-based Fantasy Records, with rants, comic routines, and satirical interviews on the themes that made him famous: [[jazz]], [[Ethics|moral philosophy]], politics, patriotism, religion, law, [[Race (human categorization)|race]], abortion, [[psychoactive drug|drugs]], the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and [[Jewish peoplehood|Jewishness]]. These albums were later compiled and re-released as ''The Lenny Bruce Originals''. Two later records were produced and sold by Bruce himself, including a 10-inch album of the 1961 San Francisco performances that started his legal troubles. Starting in the late 1950s, other unissued Bruce material was released by [[Alan Douglas (record producer)|Alan Douglas]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Phil Spector]], as well as Fantasy. Bruce developed the complexity and tone of his material in [[Enrico Banducci]]'s [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] nightclub, the "[[hungry i]]", where [[Mort Sahl]] had earlier made a name for himself.

Branded a "sick comic"—though it was the perceived "sickness" of modern society that he was railing about—Bruce was essentially blacklisted from television, and when he did appear thanks to sympathetic fans like [[Steve Allen]] or Hugh Hefner, it was with great concessions to [[Broadcast Standards and Practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of Television &amp; Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=The Paley Center for Media|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes that might offend, like a bit on airplane [[inhalant|glue-sniffing]] teenagers that was done live for ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]'' in 1959, had to be typed out and pre-approved by network officials.

His growing fame led to appearances on the nationally televised ''Steve Allen Show'', where he made his debut with an unscripted comment on the recent marriage of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] to [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]], wondering, "will Elizabeth Taylor become [[bar and bat mitzvah|bar mitzvahed]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=oCplnUga0hU?t=1m45s|title=Lenny Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--San Francisco columnist [[Herb Caen]], however, was an early and enthusiastic supporter, writing in 1959:
&lt;blockquote&gt;They call Lenny Bruce a [[sick comic]], and sick he is. Sick of all the pretentious phoniness of a generation that makes his vicious humor meaningful. He is a rebel, but not without a cause, for there are shirts that need un-stuffing, egos that need deflating. Sometimes you feel guilty laughing at some of Lenny's mordant jabs, but that disappears a second later when your inner voice tells you with pleased surprise, 'but that's true.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;
--&gt;
On February 3, 1961, in the midst of a severe blizzard, he gave a famous performance at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York. It was recorded and later released as a three-disc set, titled ''The Carnegie Hall Concert''.{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}} In the liner notes, Albert Goldman described it as follows:{{cite quote|date=June 2016}}

{{quote|This was the moment that an obscure yet rapidly rising young comedian named Lenny Bruce chose to give one of the greatest performances of his career. ... The performance contained in this album is that of a child of the jazz age. Lenny worshiped the gods of Spontaneity, Candor and [[Free association (psychology)|Free Association]]. He fancied himself an oral jazzman. His ideal was to walk out there like [[Charlie Parker]], take that mike in his hand like a horn and blow, blow, blow everything that came into his head just as it came into his head with nothing censored, nothing translated, nothing mediated, until he was pure mind, pure head sending out brainwaves like radio waves into the heads of every man and woman seated in that vast hall. Sending, sending, sending, he would finally reach a point of [[clairvoyance]] where he was no longer a performer but rather a medium transmitting messages that just came to him from out there—from recall, fantasy, prophecy.

A point at which, like the practitioners of [[automatic writing]], his tongue would outrun his mind and he would be saying things he didn't plan to say, things that surprised, delighted him, cracked him up—as if he were a spectator at his own performance!}}

==Personal life==
In 1951, Bruce met [[Honey Bruce|Honey Harlow]], a [[stripper]] from [[Manila, Arkansas]]. They were married that same year, and Bruce was determined she end her work as a stripper.&lt;ref&gt;Kottler, Jeffrey A., ''Divine Madness: Ten Stories of Creative Struggle'' (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass, 2006), 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce and Harlow eventually left New York City in 1953 for the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where they got work as a double act at the Cup and Saucer in Los Angeles, California. Bruce then went on to join the bill at the club Strip City. Harlow found employment at the Colony Club, which was widely known to be the best burlesque club in Los Angeles at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce left Strip City in late 1954 and found work within the [[San Fernando Valley]] at a variety of strip clubs. As the master of ceremonies, he introduced the strippers while performing his own ever-evolving material. The clubs of the Valley provided the perfect environment for Bruce to create new routines: According to Bruce's primary biographer, Albert Goldman, it was "precisely at the moment when he sank to the bottom of the barrel and started working the places that were the lowest of the low" that he suddenly broke free of "all the restraints and inhibitions and disabilities that formerly had kept him just mediocre and began to blow with a spontaneous freedom and resourcefulness that resembled the style and inspiration of his new friends and admirers, the jazz musicians of the modernist school."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Honey and Lenny's daughter Kitty Bruce was born in 1955.&lt;ref name="Ofiicial Lenny Bruce site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology – The 50s|url=http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-50s/|website=The Official Lenny Bruce Site|publisher=Mystic Liquid|accessdate=November 28, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113122849/http://www.lennybruceofficial.com/the-life-of-lenny-bruce/chronology-the-50s/|archive-date=November 13, 2011|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an affair with the jazz singer [[Annie Ross]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/03/movies/pop-music-a-free-spirited-survivor-lands-on-her-feet.html|title=A Free-Spirited Survivor Lands on Her Feet|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 3, 1993|first=James|last=Gavin|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Lenny's divorce from Honey was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lenny Bruce|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/406/000022340/|website=NNDB|accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal troubles==
[[File:Lenny Bruce arrest.jpg|thumb|upright|Bruce at his arrest in 1961]]
Bruce's desire to end his wife's stripper days led him to pursue schemes that were designed to make as much money as possible. The most notable was the Brother Mathias Foundation scam, which resulted in Bruce's arrest in Miami, Florida in 1951 for impersonating a priest. He had been soliciting donations for a [[leprosy|leper]] colony in [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]) under the auspices of the "Brother Mathias Foundation", which he had legally chartered—the name was his own invention, but possibly referred to the actual Brother Matthias who had befriended [[Babe Ruth]] at the Baltimore orphanage to which Ruth had been confined as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatterfromthedugout.com/babe_and_brother_matthias.htm |title=Babe Ruth and Brother Matthias |publisher=Chatterfromthedugout.com |date= |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce had stolen several priests' clergy shirts and a clerical collar while posing as a laundry man. He was found not guilty because of the legality of the New York state-chartered foundation, the actual existence of the Guiana [[leper colony]], and the inability of the local clergy to expose him as an impostor. Later, in his semifictional autobiography ''[[How to Talk Dirty and Influence People]]'', Bruce said that he had made about $8,000 in three weeks, sending $2,500 to the leper colony and keeping the rest.

===Obscenity arrests===
On October 4, 1961, Bruce was arrested for obscenity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/lennybruce/chronology.htm#1961|title=Lenny Bruce – Chronology|access-date=June 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613155335/http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/lennybruce/chronology.htm#1961|archive-date=June 13, 2007|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Jazz Workshop]] in San Francisco; he had used the word ''[[wikt:cocksucker|cocksucker]]'' and riffed that "''to'' is a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]], ''come'' is a [[verb]]", that the sexual context of ''[[orgasm|come]]'' is so common that it bears no weight, and that if someone hearing it becomes upset, he "probably can't come".&lt;ref name=UMKC&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Lenny|title=To is a Preposition, Come is a Verb|website=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the jury acquitted him, other law enforcement agencies began monitoring his appearances, resulting in frequent arrests under charges of obscenity.
[[File:Lenny Bruce Mugshot 4-27-63.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce in 1963, after having been arrested in San Francisco]]
Bruce was arrested again in 1961, in [[Philadelphia]], for [[drug possession]] and again in Los Angeles, two years later. The Los Angeles arrest took place in then-unincorporated [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], and the arresting officer was a young deputy named [[Sherman Block]], who later became County Sheriff. The specification this time was that the comedian had used the word ''[[Schmuck (pejorative)|schmuck]]'', an insulting [[Yiddish]] term that is an obscene term for penis. The Hollywood charges were later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, David C.

In April 1964, he appeared twice at the [[Cafe Au Go Go]] in [[Greenwich Village]], with undercover police detectives in the audience. He was arrested along with the club owners, Howard and Elly Solomon, who were arrested for allowing an obscene performance to take place. On both occasions, he was arrested after leaving the stage, the complaints again pertaining to his use of various obscenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linder|first1=Doug|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/bruce/bruceaccount.html|website=Famous Trials: The Lenny Bruce Trial 1964|accessdate=February 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A three-judge panel presided over his widely publicized six-month trial, prosecuted by Manhattan Assistant D.A. [[Richard Kuh]], with [[Ephraim London]] and Martin Garbus as the defense attorneys. Bruce and club owner Howard Solomon were both found guilty of obscenity on November 4, 1964. The conviction was announced despite positive testimony and petitions of support from—among other artists, writers and educators—[[Woody Allen]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jules Feiffer]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[William Styron]], and [[James Baldwin]], and Manhattan journalist and television personality [[Dorothy Kilgallen]] and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Herbert J.

==Later years==
[[File:Lenny Bruce at the Fillmore.jpg|thumb|Poster for Bruce's last series of performances, which took place at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco on June 24 and 25, 1966]]

Despite his prominence as a comedian, Bruce appeared on network television only six times in his life.&lt;ref name=paley&gt;{{cite web |title=The Museum of Television &amp; Radio Presents Two Five-Letter Words: Lenny Bruce |url=http://www.paleycenter.org/pressrelease-2004-lenny-bruce|website=[[The Paley Center for Media]] |accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later club performances, Bruce was known for relating the details of his encounters with the police directly in his comedy routine. These performances often included rants about his court battles over obscenity charges, tirades against fascism and complaints that he was being denied his right to [[freedom of speech]].

Bruce was banned outright from several U.S. cities, and in September 1962, his only visit to Australia caused a media storm—although, contrary to popular belief, he was not banned, nor was he forced to leave the country. Bruce was booked for a two-week engagement at Aaron's Exchange Hotel, a small pub in central Sydney by the American-born, Australian-based promoter [[Lee Gordon (promoter)|Lee Gordon]], who was by then deeply in debt, nearing the end of his formerly successful career, and desperate to save his business.

Bruce's first show at 9&amp;nbsp;p.m. on September&amp;nbsp;6 was uneventful, but his second show at 11&amp;nbsp;p.m. led to a major public controversy. Bruce was heckled by audience members during his performance, and when local actress, Barbara Wyndon, stood up and complained that Bruce was only talking about America, and asked him to talk about something different, a clearly annoyed Bruce responded, "Fuck you, madam. That's different, isn't it?" His remark shocked some members of the audience and several walked out. By the next day the local press had blown the incident up into a major controversy, with several Sydney papers denouncing Bruce as "sick" and one even illustrating their story with a retouched photograph appearing to show Bruce giving a fascist salute. The venue owners immediately cancelled the rest of Bruce's performances, and he retreated to his Kings Cross hotel room. Local university students (including future [[OZ (magazine)|''OZ'']] magazine editor [[Richard Neville (writer)|Richard Neville]]) who were fans of Bruce's humour tried to arrange a performance at the Roundhouse at the [[University of New South Wales]], but at the last minute the university's Vice-Chancellor rescinded permission to use the venue, with no reason given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Neville |title=Hippie Hippie Shake |publisher=William Heinemann |location=Australia |year=1995 |ISBN=085615230 |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an interview he was scheduled to give on Australian television was cancelled in advance by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce remained largely confined to his hotel, but eight days later Bruce gave his third and last Australian concert at the [[Wintergarden Theatre]] in Sydney's eastern suburbs. Although the theatre had a capacity of 2,100, only 200 people attended, including a strong police presence, and in the event Bruce gave what was described as a "subdued" performance. It was long rumoured that a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC05aUlFXOE|tape recording] of Bruce's historic performance was made by police, but it was, in fact, recorded by a local jazz saxophonist, Sid Powell, who brought a portable tape recorder to the show. The tape was rediscovered in 2011 in the possession of Australian singer [[Sammy Gaha]], who had acted as Bruce's chauffeur during his visit, and it was subsequently donated to the Lenny Bruce audio collection at [[Brandeis University]]. Bruce left the country a few days later and spoke little about the experience afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.revolve.com.au/pdfs/lennybruce.pdf |author=Derek Strahan |title=When I opened for Lenny Bruce in Australia |website=revolve.com |publisher= |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/lenny_bruces_visit_to_sydney_1962 |title=Lenny Bruce's visit to Sydney 1962 |website=dictionaryofsydney.org |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://michaeladamswrites.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/lenny-bruce.pdf |author=Michael Adams |title=When Lenny Met Sydney |website=michaeladamswrites wordpress site |accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/lenny-bruce-and-his-ill-fated-sydney-tour/4636758 |title=Lenny Bruce and his ill-fated Sydney tour |date=April 18, 2013 |accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing drug use also affected his health. By 1966, he had been [[Blacklisting|blacklisted]] by nearly every nightclub in the United States, as owners feared prosecution for obscenity. Bruce gave a famous performance at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]] in December 1965. It was recorded and became his last live album, titled ''The Berkeley Concert''; his performance here has been described as lucid, clear and calm, and one of his best. His last performance took place on June 25, 1966, at The Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, on a bill with [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]].&lt;ref name="graham"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=wnZ0qL3QdkgC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Lenny+Bruce+fillmore+%22whacked+out+on+amphetamines#v=onepage&amp;q=%22whacked%20out%20on%20amphetamines%22 | title=Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out | publisher=Da Capo Press | date=2004 | accessdate=November 18, 2014 |author1=Graham, Bill | author1link = Bill Graham (promoter)|author2=Greenfield, Robert| author2link =Robert Greenfield| page=156 | isbn=978-0306813498}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was not remembered fondly by [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]], whose memoir describes Bruce as "whacked out on [[amphetamines|amphetamine]]";&lt;ref&gt;Graham, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Graham thought that Bruce finished his set emotionally disturbed. Zappa asked Bruce to sign his [[draft card]], but the suspicious Bruce refused.&lt;ref name="zappa"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=FB0O_HCpBy0C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Zappa+asked+lenny+bruce+to+sign+his+draft+card#v=onepage&amp;q=Zappa%20asked%20lenny%20bruce%20to%20sign%20his%20draft%20card | title=The Real Frank Zappa Book | publisher=Simon and Schuster |author1=Zappa, Frank |author2=Occhiogrosso, Peter | year=1989 | page=69 | isbn=9780671705725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of Hugh Hefner and with the aid of [[Paul Krassner]], Bruce wrote an autobiography. Serialized in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1964 and 1965, this material was later published as the book ''How to Talk Dirty and Influence People''.&lt;ref name=watts&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watts |first1=Steven |title=Mr Playboy: Hugh Hefner and the American dream |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780470501375 |page=190 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m5b_eM3twmEC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq=how+to+talk+dirty+and+influence+people+lenny+bruce+hefner+serialized+in+playboy#v=onepage&amp;q=how%20to%20talk%20dirty%20and%20influence%20people%20lenny%20bruce%20hefner%20serialized%20in%20playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hefner had long assisted Bruce's career, featuring him in the television debut of ''[[Playboy's Penthouse]]'' in October 1959.

During this time, Bruce also contributed a number of articles to Paul Krassner's satirical magazine ''[[The Realist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Realist Archive Project |url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/index.html |at=Issues 15, 41, 48, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and posthumous pardon==
[[File:LennyBruce Grave.JPG|thumb|Bruce's grave at [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]]]]
On August 3, 1966, a bearded Lenny Bruce was found dead in the bathroom of his [[Hollywood Hills]] home at 8825 W. Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite news|last=AP|title=Obituary|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1013.html|accessdate=November 28, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 4, 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official photo, taken at the scene, showed Bruce lying naked on the floor, a syringe and burned bottle cap nearby, along with various other [[narcotic]]s paraphernalia. Record producer [[Phil Spector]], a friend of Bruce, bought the negatives of the photographs "to keep them from the press." The official cause of death was "acute [[morphine]] poisoning caused by an overdose."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Trials of Lenny Bruce: The Fall and Rise of an American Icon|last1=Collins|first1=Ronald|last2=Skover |first2=David|year=2002|publisher=Sourcebooks Mediafusion|isbn=978-1-57071-986-8|page=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His remains were interred in [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]], but an unconventional memorial on August 21 was controversial enough to keep his name in the spotlight. The service saw over 500 people pay their respects, led by Spector. Cemetery officials had tried to block the ceremony after advertisements for the event encouraged attendees to bring box lunches and noisemakers. [[Dick Schaap]] eulogized Bruce in ''Playboy'', with the memorable last line: "One last four-letter word for Lenny: Dead. At forty. ''That's'' obscene."

His epitaph reads: "Beloved father – devoted son/Peace at last."

Bruce has one daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Honey Bruce Friedman, 78, Entertainer and 'Lenny's Shady Lady'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/arts/20friedman.html|work=New York Times|date=September 20, 2005|page=A27|access-date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pd&gt;{{cite news |author=O'Malley, Ryan, |url=http://www.timesleader.com/pittstondispatch/news/Lenny_Bruce_rsquo_s_daughter_reaching_out_10-04-2009.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123024059/http://www.timesleader.com/pittstondispatch/news/Lenny_Bruce_rsquo_s_daughter_reaching_out_10-04-2009.html |archivedate=November 23, 2011 |title=Lenny Bruce's daughter reaching out: Pittston resident Kitty Bruce hopes to help women in recovery with "Lenny's House"|newspaper=Pittston Dispatch|location=[[Pittston, Pennsylvania]] |accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2003, thirty-seven years after Bruce's death, [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] George Pataki granted him a posthumous [[pardon]] for his obscenity conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Minnis, Glenn [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/23/entertainment/main590005.shtml "Lenny Bruce Pardoned"], [[CBS News]]/[[Associated Press]], December 23, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="totn-hentoff"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;br&gt;

Never popular himself—because he was too cryptic and too scatological for popular taste—he nevertheless influenced a whole generation of comics, just as Stein influenced Hemingway and that generation of writers.

Bruce was the subject of the 1974 biographical film ''[[Lenny (film)|Lenny]]'', directed by [[Bob Fosse]] and starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] (in an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award-nominated Best Actor]] role), and based on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage play of the same name written by [[Julian Barry]] and starring [[Cliff Gorman]] in his 1972 [[Tony Award]]-winning role. In addition, the main character's editing of a fictionalized film version of ''Lenny'' was a major part of Fosse's own biopic, the 1979 Academy Award-nominated ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]].

The documentary ''Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth'', directed by [[Robert B. Weide]] and narrated by [[Robert De Niro]], was released in 1998. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]]

In 2004, [[Comedy Central]] listed Bruce at number three on its list of the 100 greatest stand-ups of all time, placing above Woody Allen (4th) and below Richard Pryor (1st) and George Carlin (2nd).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listology.com/list/comedy-central-100-greatest-standups-all-time |title=List of Comedy Central's 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time |publisher=listology.com |date= |accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both comedians who ranked higher than Bruce considered him a major influence; Pryor said that hearing Bruce for the first time "changed my life,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/richard-pryor/news/pryor.-i-owe-it-all-to-lenny-bruce|title=Pryor: I Owe It All To Lenny Bruce|date=May 21, 2004|work=Contactmusic.com|access-date=April 22, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Carlin was arrested along with Bruce after refusing to provide identification when police raided a Bruce performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Profanity|series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|season=2|number=10|episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes|serieslink=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|airdate=August 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Libya, Libya, Libya'''" ({{lang-ar|ليبيا ليبيا ليبيا}} ''Lībiyā, Lībiyā, Lībiyā''), also known as "'''Ya Beladi'''", "''O my country!''", is the [[national anthem]] of [[Libya]], and was previously the [[national anthem]] of the [[Kingdom of Libya]], from 1951 to 1969. It was composed by [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]], in 1951, with the lyrics themselves being written by [[Al Bashir Al Arebi]]. The Anthem is also used as the theme song for a Belgium television show named "FC De kampioenen"

==History==

===Kingdom of Libya===
"Libya, Libya, Libya" was composed by [[Mohammed Abdel Wahab]] in 1951 and was originally the [[national anthem]] of the [[Kingdom of Libya]], from its independence in 1951 until 1969 when [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] was overthrown by a bloodless [[coup d'état]] led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. The lyrics themselves were written by Al Bashir Al Arebi.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=26&amp;ParentID=20&amp;LangID=1|title = About Libya: Libyan National Anthem|publisher = [[National Transitional Council]] of Libya website|accessdate = August 23, 2011|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721231231/http://www.ntclibya.com/InnerPage.aspx?SSID=26&amp;ParentID=20&amp;LangID=1|archivedate = July 21, 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libyan Arab Republic===
In 1969, [[Muammar Gaddafi]] adopted the [[Egyptian Armed Forces|Egyptian military]] marching song "[[Allahu Akbar (anthem)|Allahu Akbar]]" as the national anthem of the newly proclaimed [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Libyan Arab Republic (1969–1977)|Libyan Arab Republic]], and later, the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–2011)|Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalanthems.info/ly-11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libyan civil war===
In 2011, "Libya, Libya, Libya" was declared as the new [[national anthem]] of [[Libya]] by the [[National Transitional Council]]. "Libya, Libya, Libya" ultimately did become the [[national anthem]] of [[Libya]] once again, following the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] and the [[death of Muammar Gaddafi]]. The Anthem now does not contain the verse that glorifies King Idris (shown in italics).

:Libya, Libya, Libya!

O my country, You're the heritage of my ancestors&lt;br&gt;
May [[Allah]] not bless any hand that tries to harm you&lt;br&gt;
Be saved, we are for ever [[Libyan National Army|your soldiers]]&lt;br&gt;
No matter the death toll if you've been saved&lt;br&gt;
Take from us the most credential oaths, we won't let you down, Libya&lt;br&gt;
We will never be enchained again&lt;br&gt;
We are free and have freed our homeland&lt;br&gt;
Libya, Libya, Libya!

:''Chorus''

[[Senussi|Our grandfathers]] stripped a fine determination when the call for struggle was made&lt;br&gt;
They marched carrying [[Qur'an]] in one hand,&lt;br&gt;
and their weapons by the other hand&lt;br&gt;
The universe is then full of faith and purity&lt;br&gt;
The world is then a place of goodness and godliness&lt;br&gt;
Eternity is for our grandfathers&lt;br&gt;
They have honoured this homeland&lt;br&gt;
Libya, Libya, Libya!

:''Chorus''

(''verse abolished'')&lt;br&gt;
''Extend on [[Idris I of Libya|Idris]] the honour, the descendant of the conqueror''&lt;br&gt;
''He is the symbol of struggle and [[Jihad]]''&lt;br&gt;
''He raises [[Flag of Libya|our flag]] high''&lt;br&gt;
''And we follow him, freeing our homeland,''&lt;br&gt;
''He allows praise of his throne''&lt;br&gt;
''And raises hope for Libya in [[Jannah|heaven]],''&lt;br&gt;
''A free flag''&lt;br&gt;
''Over a rich country,''&lt;br&gt;
''Libya, Libya, Libya.''

O son of Libya, O son of lions of the wild&lt;br&gt;
We're for honour and the honours are for us&lt;br&gt;
Since the time of us being honoured, people thanked our generosity and honourableness&lt;br&gt;
May Allah bless our Independence&lt;br&gt;
O Libyans, seek the dizzy heights as a position in mankind&lt;br&gt;
Our cubs, be prepared for the foreseen battles&lt;br&gt;
[[Libyan nationalism|Our youths, to prevail]]&lt;br&gt;
Life is only a struggle for homeland&lt;br&gt;
Libya, Libya, Libya!

{{distinguish|loan line sheet}}

A line sheet is a sheet used by a manufacturer in the garment/[[fashion]] industry providing information on a product for [[wholesale]] sales.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=MoGlCUnIXT4C&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;ots=RJynBaTw2K&amp;dq=line%20sheet%20fashion&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q=line%20sheet&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; It allows a garment to be listed with the sizes in its size range, great for [[inventory]] tracking. It typically includes a line drawing or photograph of the product (possibly computer generated), its identification or [[Stock keeping unit|SKU]] number, the style, and perhaps a [[Textile sample|swatch]] showing color and [[fabric]]. In lieu of swatches industry color standards such as Pantone numbers may be used. Price, minimum order amounts, order cutoff dates, contact and delivery information are also included. In the Internet era, these paper copies are being replaced by online resources like [[Joor and iVendix]].

'''''Mahoor Scores By Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh''''' is a book by [[Saman Pourisa]] about an old notation of [[Persian traditional music|Persian Music]]. It was published in 2011 by [[Iranian Academy of Arts]]. The title of the book is inspired of the name of the original writer of the notation [[Mehdi Qoli Hedayat]] (Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh). It consists of 5 chapters, and was nominated for the Winter 2012 Iran’s season National Book award.

== Background ==
Persian (Iranian) music had been merely handed down orally from one generation to the other, and [[Abjad]] system of notation was only been used in musical theories, not for the practical use. 
Modern staff notation entered to Iran about 1850AD. After that, some of Iranian musicians efforted to write the [[radif]] of Persian music using this method. 
Among those musicians, two of them managed to write a comprehensive notation. The first one was [[Alinaghi Vaziri]], but his recordings have been lost.  
The second one which is actually the first preserved comprehensive notation of the radif has been written by Mehdi Qoli Hedayat known as Mokhber-Al-Saltaneh.

'''Molly-house''' was a term used in 18th- and 19th-century [[England]] for a meeting place for [[homosexual men]].

Even if these clubs tended to display a heavy sexual connotation, some critics are reluctant to classify them as [[brothel]]s. 
[[Rictor Norton]], for example, argues that the regular customers could have been in fact mutual friends, at least at the beginning, since consistent evidence concerning male [[prostitution]] seems to be insufficient until the 1780s.&lt;ref name="Clap, Margaret fl. 1710–1726"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rictor Norton|title=The Gay Subculture in Early Eighteenth-Century London|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/molly2.htm|website=Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook.|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At that time homosexual sexual activities were [[Buggery Act 1533|illegal]] and were heavily prosecuted; they remained [[capital offence]]s until 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Homosexuality in Great Britain Section Two: Legislation|url=http://www.banap.net/spip.php?article156|website=banap.net|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, particularly during the 1720s, molly-houses came to be the scenes of raids and arrests,&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; and their customers the ideal target for [[blackmail]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rictor Norton|authorlink1= Rictor Norton|editor1-last=Robert Aldrich|editor1-first=Garry Wotherspoon|title=Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History Vol.1:From antiquity to World War II|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-15982-2|page=212|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molly-houses can be considered a precursor to some types of contemporary meeting places for the [[gay community]].&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/74949|title = Clap, Margaret [known as Mother Clap] (fl. 1710–1726), 'molly house' keeper|date = 2004|accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = Oford DNB|publisher = OUP|last = Norton|first = Rictor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''molly'' (also spelt as ''molley'', ''mollie'', ''mally'') is a pet-form of the female forename [[Mary (name)|Mary]], and had two main connotations in 18th century English.&lt;ref name="molly"&gt;{{cite web|title=molly|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/120943#eid36196008|website=OED|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one is close to the word [[moll (slang)|moll]], designating a lower-class girl or woman, occasionally a prostitute. The second one is classified as slang, defining an effeminate, usually homosexual, male.&lt;ref name="molly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grose1796"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grose |first=Francis |year=1796 |title=A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue |edition=3 |publisher=Printed for Hooper and Wigstead |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbJKAAAAMAAJ |quote=MOLLY, a miss Molly, an effeminate fellow, a sodomite.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/molly2.htm The Gay subculture in eighteenth century England] Rictor Norton Quote: However, I think we have to exercise some caution and avoid jumping to the conclusion that just because we do not hear of the molly subculture or effeminate queens before 1700, therefore they did not exist until 1700.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the possible perception of intrinsic female features deriving from the association with the name Mary, another possible origin of this denomination for a homosexual man could be found in the [[Latin]] form ''mollis'', indicating the supposed passive-effeminate partner in male homosexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mollis|url=http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Mollis.pdf|website=Encyclopedia of Homosexuality|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 1762 Swedish/English dictionary by [[Jacob Serenius]] and in a 1767 French/English dictionary by [[Thomas Nugent (lexicographer)|Thomas Nugent]] the word was present, but simply defined a [[sodomy|sodomite]], without effeminate connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=Rictor|title=Homosexual Terms in 18th-century Dictionaries|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/diction.htm|website=Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses of the word can be seen in the verb ''to molly'' (to have a homosexual intercourse),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=to molly|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/120945|website=OED|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the expressions ''mollycot'' (a British regional expression indicating man interested in activities traditionally associated with women)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mollycot|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/120949#eid36197040|website=OED|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Miss Molly''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Molly|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/252752#eid11540353|website=OED|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (referring to an effeminate or homosexual male).

===Gender issues in 18th century London ===
According to several critics, the English society of the time was giving an increasing importance to the concepts of [[family]] and [[household]] as fundamental units for reproduction, subsistence and interaction between generations:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Shoemaker|first1 = Robert B.|title = Gender in English society, 1650–1850 : the emergence of separate spheres?|date = 1998|publisher = Longman|location = London|isbn = 0-582-10315-0|pages = 61, 85|edition = 1. publ., [Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this context, male and female roles evolved into more static forms. Men were associated with an active, assertive role both in sexual behaviour and in managing the household,&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=Anthony|title=Gender, sex and subordination in England, 1500–1800|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-07650-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; while women were ''defined in terms of their maternal functions,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shoemaker|first1=Robert B.|title=Gender in English society, 1650–1850 : the emergence of separate spheres?|date=1998|publisher=Longman|location=London|isbn=0-582-10315-0|page=85|edition=1. publ., [Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrarily to a tradition common at the start of the century, attributing them features related to lustfulness and aggressiveness in sexual matters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is possible to see that the notion of ''molly-house'' seems to be deeply rooted in the developing of a distinctive identity according to [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]], a peculiar social phenomenon considered crucial by some critics in [[gender studies]].&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=43233 Sex and the Gender Revolution, Volume 1, Heterosexuality and the Third Gender in Enlightenment London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090719214414/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=43233 |date=2009-07-19 }} Randolph Trumbach; Quote: A revolution in gender relations occurred in London around 1700, resulting in a sexual system that endured in many aspects until the sexual revolution of the 1960s. For the first time in European history, there emerged three genders: men, women, and a third gender of adult effeminate sodomites, or homosexuals.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=Anthony|title=Gender, sex and subordination in England, 1500–1800|date=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-07650-9|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shoemaker|first1=Robert B.|title=Gender in English society, 1650–1850 : the emergence of separate spheres?|date=1998|publisher=Longman|location=London|isbn=0-582-10315-0|page=59|edition=1. publ., [Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As stated by Robert Shoemaker,''...&amp;nbsp;any activity (such as homosexual intercourse), in which [men] could be seen as acting passively was further marginalised.''

In fact, some of the activities popular among the homosexual community, that were seemingly taking place in molly-houses (by nature, marginalised meeting places), were often associated both to female roles and to a family environment (i.e. [[cross-dressing]], ''marriage'' and ''mock birth'' [[ritual]]s, as described in a [[satire]] work of the time, Edward Ward's ''Satyrical Reflections on Clubs, Chapter XXV Of the Mollies Club'').&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Edward|title=Of the Mollies Club|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/nedward.htm|website=Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molly-houses and the homosexual subculture in London ===
[[File:The Covt. Garden morning frolick. Gaillardise du Commun Jardin LCCN2006682110.tif|alt=Covent Garden in 1747, on a satirical print The Covt. Garden morning frolick. Gaillardise du Commun Jardin by Louis Peter Boitard.|left|thumb|361x361px|[[Covent Garden]] in 1747, in [[Louise Peter Boitard]]'s [[Satire|satirical]] print ''The Covt. Garden morning frolick. Gaillardise du Commun Jardin''.]]
As sodomy was a capital offense, the organisation of homosexual men and their activities had to be a crucial point, in order to keep the community as safe as possible from prosecution. As a consequence, molly districts seemed to appear, and eventually grow, in areas in which their business could be acknowledged and tolerated at the same time: such connivance could be often found in areas with a high rate of criminal acts such as theft and prostitution.&lt;ref name="The Sodomites' Walk in Moorfields"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=Rictor|title=The Sodomites' Walk in Moorfields|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/moorfiel.htm|website=The Gay Subculture in Georgian England|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in ''[[The London Journal]]'' singled out a number of areas:&lt;ref name="The Sodomites' Walk in Moorfields" /&gt; 
* The arcades of [[Covent Garden]] and the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]];&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* [[Moorfields]] (the path crossing the middle of these fields was known as the Sodomites' Walk);&lt;ref name="The Sodomites' Walk in Moorfields" /&gt;
* [[Lincoln's Inn]] and its [[Public toilet|bog-house]], as recorded in trials.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* The south side of [[St James's Park]], a popular [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] ground frequented by soldiers from the nearby barracks and homosexual habitués.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
The presence of [[pillory|pillories]] punishing sodomitical offenses, ironically, identified the sites where such acts frequently took place. Pillories were often organised near the crime locations attributed to the accused.&lt;ref name="The Sodomites' Walk in Moorfields" /&gt;

Molly-houses could be considered the most organised phenomenon of London 18th century [[homosexual subculture]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=Rictor|title=Homosexuality - Mother Clap's Molly-House &amp; Deputy Marshall Hitchin|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/gu16.htm|website=The Georgian Underworld by Rictor Norton|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were enclosed, private spaces gathering individuals with a common purpose, that is to say, socializing and seeking pleasure with partners of the same sex.

=== Law enforcement and sources of information ===
Before 1533, the "unnatural sin" (also defined "detestable crime" in trial records&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Gay.jsp#prosecutions|title = Homosexuality - Search strategies|date = |accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = Old Bailey Proceedings Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;) of sodomy or ''[[buggery]]'', (a specific common law offence, meaning anal intercourse between a man and another man or woman, or anal or vaginal intercourse with a beast &amp;ndash; in this way encompassing both sodomy and bestiality) was dealt with by the [[ecclesiastical court]]s. From that year however, the country's first civil sodomy law was introduced as ''An Acte for the punishment of the vice of Buggerie'' ([[Buggery Act 1533]]), and also criminal courts could prosecute individuals accused of such "crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#sexualoffences|title = Crimes Tried at the Old Bailey|date = |accessdate = |website = Old Bailey Proceedings Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Old Bailey Online Proceedings site:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Crimes.jsp#sodomy|title = Crimes tried at the Old Bailey - Sexual Offences - Sodomy|date = |accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = Old Bailey Proceedings Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to obtain a conviction, it was necessary to prove that both penetration and ejaculation had occurred, and two witnesses were required to prove the crime. Both the "active" and "passive" partner could be found guilty of this offence. But due to the difficulty of proving this actual penetration and ejaculation many men were prosecuted with the reduced charge of assault with sodomitical intent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;From the late 1690s to the early 1710s, the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners|Societies for the Reformation of Manners]] (organizations born after the Revolution in 1688, seeking to eliminate immorality and disrespect for religion from public life)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; actively pursued prostitutes, Sabbath breakers and also homosexual men, through the means of spies and ''provocateurs'' to dismantle molly houses and prosecute individuals. In the 1720s and 30s thief-takers like [[Charles Hitchen]] and [[Jonathan Wild]] stimulated the Societies' activities. The peak of this wave of prosecution is to be recognized in the late 1720s with a raid on the most famous molly house, Mother Clap's.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to [[Rictor Norton]]:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{cquote|The organized molly subculture was effectively suppressed by the mid-1730s. However, molly houses began to reappear again after 1750.}}

Molly-houses at that time were evidently and intrinsically related to since they gathered sodomites being a [[capital offence]], so most of the information concerning molly-houses and the community around them is available through an indirect form, that is, mostly through newspaper reports and  the accounts given during the Old Bailey trials relating to sexual offences, such as ''sodomy, assault with sodomitical intent'' and ''keeping a brothel'', or sometimes the ones related to theft cases (for example, in cases with men caught stealing during a sexual encounter).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The trial of Thomas Gordon|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t17320705-30&amp;div=t17320705-30|website=The Proceedings of the Old Bailey|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The trial of Stephen Margrove and John Wood|url = http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t17190514-42&amp;div=t17190514-42|website = The Proceedings of the Old Bailey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important sources are [[satires]] and [[pamphlets]], such as ''An Answer To A Late Insolent Libel'' by [[Jonathan Wild]], [[Ned Ward|Edward Ward]]'s ''Satyrical Reflections on Clubs'', Chapter XXV ''Of the Mollies Club'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=Rictor|title=The Mollies Clubs, 1709–10|url=http://www.rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/nedward.htm|website=Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dunton]]'s ''The He-Strumpets. A Satyr on the Sodomite-Club'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=Rictor|title=The He-Strumpets, 1707–10|url=http://www.rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/dunton.htm|website=Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Dalton's  ''A Genuine Narrative of all the Street Robberies Committed since October last'' and as well as other works.

Later in the eighteenth century, waves of prosecutions can be identified in the 1750s and 1770s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However most of the details concerning sexual offences trials came to be more and more rare due to an increasing need of a strait-laced morality, but fraud and extortion cases seemed to continue in giving ''retail at length detailed accounts of alleged sexual encounters between men''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Activities ===
The adoption of specific codes and rituals in relating to each other seemed to be another feature allowing cohesion in the group. These peculiarities were often described in trials and libels, often to be put on public display and disapproval. Some of the uses seemed to be:
* the use of  Female Dialect, and the assumption of female names, the Maiden Name tradition:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/maiden.htm|title = Maiden Names and Little Sport|date = |accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = The Gay Subculture in Georgian England|publisher = |last = Norton|first = Rictor}}&lt;/ref&gt; the controversial figure of [[Charles Hitchen]] (alternative spelling: ''Hitchin'') member of the [[Society for the Reformation of Manners]], notable [[thief-taker]], former Under City Marshal in London, was described as a regular in molly-houses according to a libel written by [[Jonathan Wild]] and also to be referred by using female names.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/hitchin2.htm|title = Jonathan Wild Exposes Charles Hitchin, 1718|date = |accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook.|publisher = |last = Norton|first = Rictor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the ''Marshal'' was complimented by the Company with the Titles of ''Madam'' and ''Ladyship''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;From James Dalton's ''A Genuine Narrative of all the Street Robberies Committed since October last'':&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1728dalt.htm|title = A Genuine Narrative of all the Street Robberies Committed since October last|date = |accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook.|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Their chief Names are as follows. ''Ellinor Roden'', ''China Mary'', ''Flying Horse Moll'', ''Smal Coal Mary'', J''ohannah the Ox-cheek Woman, Tub Nan,' Sukey Pisquill, Garter Mary, Hardward Nan, Prety Criss'', a Soldier of the 2d Regiment, ''Aunt England'', a noted Soap Boyler, ''Pomegranate Molly, Orange Mary'', an Orange Merchant near London-Bridge'','Old Fish Hannah,'Kate Hutton'' an old Man that never wears a Shirt, ''Thumbs and Waste Jenny, Queen Irons'', alias ''Pippin Mary'', ''Hanover Kate'', spouse to Pippin Mary'',Miss Kitten (Oviat), Rose Gudger, 'Black Moll, &amp;c''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/center&gt;They could take on a female persona, have a female name, and affect [[effeminate|feminine]] mannerisms and speech. Again from Jonathan Wild:&lt;blockquote&gt;The men calling one another ''my Dear'', and hugging, kissing, and tickling each other, as if they were a Mixture of wanton Males and Females, and assuming effeminate Voices and Airs&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* [[Cross-dressing]], from Jonathan Wild:&lt;blockquote&gt;At the expected Time several of the sporting Youngsters were seized in Women's Apparel, and convey'd to the ''Compter''. Next Morning they were carried before the Lord-Mayor in the same Dress they were taken in. Some were compleatly rigg'd in Gowns, Petticoats, Head-cloths, fine lac'd Shoes, furbelow'd Scarves and Marks; some had Riding-hoods; some were dressed like Milk-Maids, others like Shepheardesses with green Hats, Waistcoats and Petticoats; and others had their Faces patch'd and painted, and wore very extensive Hoop-petticoats, which had been very lately introduced.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Marriage ceremonies: often a euphemism for sexual intercourse but sometimes actual ceremonies between a Mollie and his male lover, enacted to symbolise their partnership and commitment to each other.&lt;ref name="Norton1992"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mother Clap's molly house : the gay subculture in England, 1700–1830 |last=Norton |first=Rictor |year=1992 |publisher=GMP |isbn=978-0-85449-188-9 |oclc=27100305 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m8-GAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Mock-birth" rituals: during which a man dressed in a nightgown pretended to be a woman giving birth to a baby assisted by fellow Mollies as "midwives"  — a fact confirmed by other sources including trials.This ritual almost certainly originated as a [[couvade]], designated to collectively relieve the extreme stress this particular social group was forced to live under. The ceremonies described by Ned Ward took place in specific periods called "Festival Nights", which other sources indicate took place towards the end of December.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Mother Clap's molly-house ===
[[File:Rocque Map of London 1746 058.jpg|thumb|Field Lane, [[Holborn]], the location of [[Mother Clap]]'s molly-house on the left side of the picture, Rocque Map of London, 1746.|left|368x368px]]
The most known molly-house in 18th century London was the one owned by [[Margaret Clap|Mother Clap]], which had been open from 1724 until 1726, when a raid sustained by the [[Societies for the Reformation of Manners]] had it dismantled. It was located in Field Lane, near to another tavern ''The Bunch of Grapes'' in [[Holborn]], a suburban parish of [[Middlesex]] a short distance from the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=Rictor|title=The Raid on Mother Clap's Molly House|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/mother.htm|website=The Gay Subculture in Georgian England|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/maiden.htm|title=Homosexualitiy in Eighteenth-Century England: Maiden Names and Little Sports|author=|date=|website=rictornorton.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area came to be renowned as a [[rookery (slum)|rookery]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lichtenstein|first1=Rachel|title=Diamond Street: The Hidden World of Hatton Garden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tT8TqZfFJYAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0141911522&amp;pg=PT133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=Penguin Books|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the next decades, and described as ''a sort of distinct town, or district calculated for the reception of the darkest and most dangerous enemies to society; in which when pursued for the commission of crimes they easily conceal themselves and readily escape''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Place Papers vol. XXXVIII|location=British Library|page=fol.139|edition=Add. MS, 27826}}&lt;/ref&gt; A literary example can be interpreted as a sort of confirmation of the reputation of this lane, since [[Charles Dickens]] placed here [[Fagin]]'s den, an old [[Jewish]] man earning a living as a [[fence (criminal)|fence]], in his 1837 [[novel]] ''[[Oliver Twist]]''. &lt;br /&gt;This peculiar homosexual meeting place, however, became well known to the public during the 1720s through the trial of its keeper, [[Margaret Clap]], indicted for keeping a disorderly house and for encouraging her customers to commit sodomy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The trial of Margaret Clap|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t17260711-54-defend317&amp;div=t17260711-54#highlight|website=The Old Bailey Proceedings Online|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, particularly, through the account given by an agent provocateur, Samuel Stevens.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Shoemaker|first1 = Robert|last2 = Hitchcock|first2 = Tim|title = Tales from the hanging court|date = 2010|publisher = Bloomsbury Academic|location = London|isbn = 978-0-340-91375-8|page = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Sunday Night the 14th of November. I went to the Prisoners House in Field-Lane, Holbourn. I found near Men Fifty there, making Love to one another as they call'd it. Sometimes they'd sit in one anothers Laps, use their Hands indecently Dance and make Curtsies and mimick the Language of Women - O Sir! - Pray Sir! - Dear Sir! Lord how can ye serve me so! - Ah ye little dear Toad! Then they'd go by Couples, into a Room on the same Floor to be marry'd as they call'd it. The Door at that Room was kept by - Ecclestone to prevent any body from balking their Diversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t17260711-54&amp;div=t17260711-54&amp;|title=The trial of Margaret Clap|last=|first=|date=|website=Old Bailey Online Proceedings|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She and half a dozen of her customers were also put into the pillory, fined, and imprisoned for periods of up to two years. Three of her customers were hanged for sodomy: Gabriel Lawrence, a 43-year-old milkman; William Griffin, a 43 year old furniture upholsterer; and Thomas Wright, who was a molly house keeper.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Trials and personalities related to molly-houses ===
In the eighteenth century according to the Old Bailey Proceedings, only two individuals were formally arrested for keeping a molly-house: Margaret Clap and Julius Cesar Taylor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t17281016-60-off269&amp;div=t17281016-60#highlight|title = The trial of Julius Cesar Taylor|date = |accessdate = 29 November 2015|website = Old Bailey Online Proceedings|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  but several accused of sodomitical practices seems to be reported as brothel keepers as well (i.e. Thomas Wright).

On 9 May 1726, three men (Gabriel Lawrence, William Griffin, and Thomas Wright) were hanged at [[Tyburn]] for buggery following a raid of [[Margaret Clap]]'s molly-house. Their trials are fundamental since they provide important details for the descriptions of the gay community surroundings. On 12 April 1727 Charles Hitchin was convicted of assault with sodomitical intent .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=Rictor|title=The Trial of Charles Hitchin|url=http://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/hitchin1.htm|website=Homosexuality in Eighteenth-Century England: A Sourcebook|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The trial of Charles Hitchin; sodomy, attemped sodomy.|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t17270412-41&amp;div=t17270412-41|website=The Old Bailey Proceedings Online|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nibelungenlied manuscript-c f1r.jpg|250px|thumb|First page from Manuscript C (ca. 1230)]]
The '''''Nibelungenlied''''' ([[Middle High German]]: '''''Der Nibelunge liet''''' or '''''Der Nibelunge nôt'''''), translated as '''''The Song of the Nibelungs''''', is an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] from around 1200 written in [[Middle High German]]. Its anonymous poet was likely from the region of [[Passau]]. The ''Nibelungenlied'' is based on an oral tradition that has some of its origin in historic events and individuals of the 5th and 6th centuries and that spread throughout almost all of [[Germanic languages|Germanic-speaking]] Europe. Parallels to the German poem from Scandinavia are found especially in the [[heroic lay]]s of the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and in the ''[[Völsunga saga]]''.

The poem is split into two parts: in the first part, [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] comes to [[Worms]] to acquire the hand of the [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] princess [[Kriemhild]] from her brother King [[Gunther]]. Gunther agrees to let Siegfried marry Kriemhild if Siegfried helps Gunther acquire the warrior-queen [[Brünhild]] as his wife. Siegfried does this and marries Kriemhild; however Brünhild and Kriemhild become rivals, leading eventually to Siegfried's murder by the Burgundian vassal [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen]] with Gunther's involvement. In the second part, the widow Kriemhild is married to [[Attila the Hun|Etzel]], king of the [[Huns]]. She later invites her brother and his court to visit Etzel's kingdom intending to kill Hagen. Her revenge results in the death of all the Burgundians who came to Etzel's court as well as the destruction of Etzel's kingdom and the death of Kriemhild herself.

The ''Nibelungenlied'' was the first heroic epic put into writing in Germany, helping to found a larger genre of written heroic poetry. The poem's tragedy appears to have bothered its medieval audience, and very early on a sequel was written, the ''[[Nibelungenklage]]'', which made the tragedy less final. The poem was forgotten after around 1500, but was rediscovered in 1755. Dubbed the "German ''Iliad''", the ''Nibelungenlied'' began a new life as the German national epic. The poem was appropriated for nationalist purposes and was heavily used in anti-democratic, reactionary, and [[Nazi party|National-Socialist]] propaganda before and during the [[Second World War]]. Its legacy today is most visible in [[Richard Wagner]]'s operatic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', which, however, is mostly based on Old Norse sources. In 2009, the three main manuscripts of the ''Nibelungenlied'' were inscribed in [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]] in recognition of their historical significance.{{sfn|UNESCO|2009}} It has been called "one of the most impressive, and certainly the most powerful, of the German epics of the Middle Ages."{{sfn|Garland|Garland|1997}}

==Manuscript sources==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Berlin fragm 44.jpg|thumb|''Nibelungenlied'' Fragment, Berlin, SB, Fragm. 44]]

The poem in its various written forms was lost by the end of the 16th century, but [[manuscript]]s from as early as the 13th century were re-discovered during the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Savage|first1=Bryn|title=Creating Germany's National Myth|url=http://brbl-archive.library.yale.edu/exhibitions/nibelungenlied/essay.html|website=yale.edu|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=July 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are thirty-five known manuscripts of the ''Nibelungenlied'' and its variant versions. Eleven of these manuscripts are essentially complete.&lt;ref&gt;the [[Donaueschingen]] manuscript C can be considered as the longest version, although some pages are missing {{cite web |url=http://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/blb/blbhtml/nib/uebersicht.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616084614/http://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/blb/blbhtml/nib/uebersicht.html |archivedate=2006-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest version seems to be the one preserved in manuscript "B". Twenty-four manuscripts are in various fragmentary states of completion, including one version in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (manuscript 'T'). The text contains approximately 2,400 stanzas in 39 ''Aventiuren''. The title under which the poem has been known since its discovery is derived from the final line of one of the three main versions, "hie hât daz mære ein ende: daz ist der Nibelunge liet" ("here the story takes an end: this is the lay of the Nibelungs"). ''Liet'' here means ''lay'', ''tale'' or ''epic'' rather than simply ''song'', as it would in [[German language|Modern German]].

The manuscripts' sources deviate considerably from one another. [[Philology|Philologists]] and literary scholars usually designate three main genealogical groups for the entire range of available manuscripts, with two primary versions comprising the oldest known copies: *AB and *C. This categorization derives from the signatures on the *A, *B, and *C manuscripts as well as the wording of the last verse in each source: "daz ist der Nibelunge liet" or "daz ist der Nibelunge nôt". Nineteenth-century philologist [[Karl Lachmann]] developed this categorisation of the manuscript sources in ''Der Nibelunge Noth und die Klage nach der ältesten Überlieferung mit Bezeichnung des Unechten und mit den Abweichungen der gemeinen Lesart'' (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1826).

==Synopsis==
The famous opening of the ''Nibelungenlied'' is actually thought to be an addition by the redactor of the "C" version of the ''Nibelungenlied'', as it does not appear in the oldest manuscripts. It may have been inspired by the prologue of the ''Nibelungenklage''.{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1036}}

The original version instead began with the introduction of Kriemhild, the protagonist of the work.

The epic is divided into two parts, the first dealing with the story of Siegfried and Kriemhild, the wooing of Brünhild and the death of Siegfried at the hands of Hagen, and Hagen's hiding of the Nibelung treasure in the Rhine (Chapters 1–19). The second part deals with Kriemhild's marriage to Etzel, her plans for revenge, the journey of the Burgundians to the court of Etzel, and their last stand in Etzel's hall (Chapters 20–39).

===Siegfried and Kriemhild===
[[File:Siegfried and Kriemhild.jpg|220px|thumb|Siegfried and Kriemhild]]
[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 003.jpg|220px|thumb|Gunther's wedding night ([[Johann Heinrich Füssli]] 1807)]]

The first chapter introduces the court of [[Burgundians|Burgundy]]. [[Kriemhild]] (the virgin sister of King [[Gunther]], and his brothers [[Gernot]] and [[Giselher of Burgundy|Giselher]]) has a dream of a falcon that is killed by two eagles. Her mother interprets this to mean that Kriemhild's future husband will die a violent death, and Kriemhild consequently resolves to remain unmarried.

The second chapter tells of the background of [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], crown prince of [[Xanten]]. His youth is narrated with little room for the adventures later attributed to him. In the third chapter, Siegfried arrives in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] with the hopes of wooing Kriemhild. Upon his arrival, [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen von Tronje]], one of King Gunther's vassals, tells Gunther about Siegfried's youthful exploits that involved winning a treasure and lands from a pair of brothers, Nibelung and Schilbung, whom Siegfried had killed when he was unable to divide the treasure between them and, almost incidentally, the killing of a dragon. Siegfried leaves his treasure in the charge of a dwarf named Alberich.

After killing the dragon, Siegfried then bathed in its blood, which rendered him invulnerable. Unfortunately for Siegfried, a leaf fell onto his back from a [[Tilia|linden tree]], and the small patch of skin that the leaf covered did not come into contact with the dragon's blood, leaving Siegfried vulnerable in that single spot. In spite of Hagen's threatening stories about his youth, the Burgundians welcome him, but do not allow him to meet the princess. Disappointed, he nonetheless remains in Worms and helps Gunther defeat the invading [[Saxons]].

In Chapter 5, Siegfried finally meets Kriemhild. Gunther requests Siegfried to sail with him to the fictional city of Isenstein in Iceland to win the hand of Iceland's Queen, [[Brünhild]]. Siegfried agrees, though only if Gunther allows him to marry Gunther's sister, Kriemhild, whom Siegfried pines for. Gunther, Siegfried and a group of Burgundians set sail for Iceland with Siegfried pretending to be Gunther's vassal. Upon their arrival, Brünhild challenges Gunther to a trial of strength with her hand in marriage as a reward. If they lose, however, they will be sentenced to death. She challenges Gunther to three athletic contests, throwing a javelin, tossing a boulder, and a leap. After seeing the boulder and javelin, it becomes apparent to the group that Brünhild is immensely strong and they fear for their lives.
[[File:Niebelung genealogy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Genealogy]]

Siegfried quietly returns to the boat on which his group had sailed and retrieves his special [[cloak]], which renders him invisible and gives him the strength of 12 men (Chapters 6–8). Siegfried, with his immense strength, invisibly leads Gunther through the trials. Unknowingly deceived, the impressed Brünhild thinks King Gunther, not Siegfried, defeated her and agrees to marry Gunther. Gunther becomes afraid that Brünhild may yet be planning to kill them, so Siegfried goes to Nibelungenland and single-handedly conquers the kingdom. Siegfried makes them his vassals and returns with a thousand of them, himself going ahead as messenger. The group of Burgundians, Gunther and Gunther's new wife-to-be Brünhild return to Worms, where a grand reception awaits them and they marry to much fanfare. Siegfried and Kriemhild are also then married with Gunther's blessings.

[[File:Siegfrieds Tod.jpg|thumb|220px|"Siegfried's Death" ([[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]], 1847)]]
[[File:Peter von Cornelius Hagen versenkt den Nibelungenhort 1859.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Hagen (legend)|Hagen]] orders servants to sink the hoard in the Rhine ([[Peter von Cornelius]], 1859)]]

However, on their wedding night, Brünhild suspects something is amiss with her situation, particularly suspecting Siegfried as a potential cause. Gunther attempts to sleep with her and, with her great strength, she easily ties him up and leaves him that way all night. After he tells Siegfried of this, Siegfried again offers his help, proposing that he slip into their chamber at night with his invisibility cloak and silently beat Brünhild into submission. Gunther agrees but says that Siegfried must not sleep with Brünhild. Siegfried slips into the room according to plan and after a difficult and violent struggle, an invisible Siegfried defeats Brünhild. Siegfried then takes her ring and belt, which are symbols of [[defloration]]. Here it is implied that Siegfried sleeps with Brünhild, despite Gunther's request. Afterwards, Brünhild no longer possesses her once-great strength and says she will no longer refuse Gunther. Siegfried gives the ring and belt to his own newly wed, Kriemhild, in Chapter 10.

Years later, Brünhild, still feeling as if she had been lied to, goads Gunther into inviting Siegfried and Kriemhild to their kingdom. Brünhild does this because she is still under the impression that Gunther married off his sister to a low-ranking [[vassal]] (while Gunther and Siegfried are in reality of equal rank) yet the normal procedures are not being followed between the two ranks combined with her lingering feelings of suspicion. Both Siegfried and Kriemhild come to Worms and all is friendly between the two until, before entering [[Worms Cathedral]], Kriemhild and Brünhild argue over who should have precedence according to their husbands' perceived ranks.

Having been earlier deceived about the relationship between Siegfried and Gunther, Brünhild thinks it is obvious that she should go first, through custom of her perceived social rank. Kriemhild, unaware of the deception involved in Brünhild's wooing, insists that they are of equal rank and the dispute escalates. Severely angered, Kriemhild shows Brünhild first the ring and then the belt that Siegfried took from Brünhild on her wedding night, and then calls her Siegfried's ''kebse'' (mistress or concubine). Brünhild feels greatly distressed and humiliated, and bursts into tears.

The argument between the queens is both a risk for the marriage of Gunther and Brünhild and a potential cause for a lethal rivalry between Gunther and Siegfried, which both Gunther and Siegfried attempt to avoid. Gunther acquits Siegfried of the charges. Despite this, [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen von Tronje]] decides to kill Siegfried to protect the honor and reign of his king. Although it is Hagen who does the deed, Gunther – who at first objects to the plot – along with his brothers knows of the plan and quietly assents. Hagen contrives a false military threat to Gunther, and Siegfried, considering Gunther a great friend, volunteers to help Gunther once again.

Under the pretext of this threat of war, Hagen persuades Kriemhild, who still trusts Hagen, to mark Siegfried's single vulnerable point on his clothing with a cross under the premise of protecting him. Now knowing Siegfried's weakness, the fake campaign is called off and Hagen then uses the cross as a target on a hunting trip, killing Siegfried with a javelin as he is drinking from a brook (Chapter 16). Kriemhild becomes aware of Hagen's deed when, in Hagen's presence, the corpse of Siegfried bleeds from the wound ([[cruentation]]). This perfidious murder is particularly dishonorable in medieval thought, as ''throwing'' a javelin is the manner in which one might slaughter a wild beast, not a knight. We see this in other literature of the period, such as with Parsifal's unwittingly dishonorable crime of combatting and slaying knights with a javelin (transformed into a swan in Wagner's opera).&lt;ref&gt;This interpretation however is contradicted both by internal evidence in later parts of the Nibelungenlied, which describe knights casting spears at each other, and independently by evidence from mediaeval sources such as Talhoffer's illustrated "Fechtbuch" which clearly shows the casting of javelins s an element of knightly combat on foot, e.g. tafeln 70 &amp; 71 of the 1467 edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Further dishonoring Siegfried, Hagen steals the hoard from Kriemhild and throws it into the [[Rhine]] (Rheingold), to prevent Kriemhild from using it to establish an army of her own.&lt;ref&gt;An alternative interpretation of Hagen's act is that he is just prudentially forestalling Kriemhild's anticipated revenge, which is of a piece with his overall stance of care to preserve the Burgundian dynasty.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kriemhild's revenge===
Kriemhild swears to take revenge for the murder of her husband and the theft of her treasure. Many years later, King Etzel of the Huns ([[Attila the Hun]]) proposes to Kriemhild, she journeys to the land of the Huns, and they are married. For the baptism of their son, she invites her brothers, the [[Burgundians]], to a feast at Etzel's castle in [[Hungary]]. Hagen does not want to go, suspecting that it is a trick by Kriemhild in order to take revenge and kill them all, but is taunted until he does. As the Burgundians cross the [[Danube]], this fate is confirmed by [[Neck (water spirit)|Nixes]], who predict that all but one monk will die. Hagen tries to drown the monk in order to render the prophecy futile, but he survives.

[[File:Johann Heinrich Füssli 048.jpg|thumb|220px|Kriemhild showing Gunther's head to Hagen (Johann Heinrich Füssli, ca. 1805)]]

The Burgundians arrive at Etzel's castle and are welcomed by Kriemhild "with lying smiles and graces." But the lord [[Theodoric the Great|Dietrich of Bern]], an ally of Etzel's, advises the Burgundians to keep their weapons with them at all times, which is normally not allowed. The tragedy unfolds as Kriemhild comes before Hagen, reproaching him for her husband Siegfried's death, and demands that he return her ''Nibelungenschatz''. Not only did Hagen humiliate her right from arrival by openly carrying [[Balmung]], Siegfried's sword stolen right away from his corpse. He also answers her boldly, admits he killed Siegfried and that he sank the Nibelungen treasure into the Rhine. The culprit, however, blames all these acts on Kriemhild's own behavior.

King Etzel then welcomes his wife's brothers warmly. But outside a tense feast in the great hall, a fight breaks out between Huns and Burgundians, and soon there is general mayhem. When word of the fight arrives at the feast, Hagen decapitates the young son of Kriemhild and Etzel before their eyes. The Burgundians take control of the hall, which is besieged by Etzel's warriors. Kriemhild offers her brothers their lives if they hand over Hagen, but they refuse. The battle lasts all day, until the queen orders the hall to be burned with the Burgundians inside.

All of the Burgundians are killed except for Hagen and Gunther, who are bound and held prisoner by Dietrich of Bern. Kriemhild has the men brought before her and orders her brother Gunther to be killed. Even after seeing Gunther's head, Hagen refuses to tell the queen what he has done with the Nibelungen treasure. Furious, Kriemhild herself cuts off Hagen's head. Old [[Hildebrand]], the mentor of Dietrich of Bern, is infuriated by the shameful deaths of the Burgundian guests. He hews Kriemhild to pieces with his sword. In a fifteenth-century manuscript, he is said to strike Kriemhild a single clean blow to the waist; she feels no pain, however, and declares that his sword is useless. Hildebrand then drops a ring and commands Kriemhild to pick it up. As she bends down, her body falls into pieces. Dietrich and Etzel and all the people of the court lament the deaths of so many heroes.

==Authorship and dating==
The ''Nibelunglied'', like other Middle High German heroic epics, is anonymous.{{sfn|Curschmann|1987|p=935|ps=, "gattungtypisch anonym".}} This anonymity extends to discussions of literature in other Middle High German works: although it is common practice to judge or praise the poems of others, no other poet refers to the author of the ''Nibelungenlied''.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=185}} Attempts to identify the ''Nibelungenlied''-poet with known authors, such as [[Bligger von Steinach]], to whom a lost epic is attributed by [[Gottfried von Strassburg]], have not found wide acceptance.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=45}} The poem is nevertheless believed to have had a single author, possibly working in a "Nibelungen workshop" ("Nibelungenwerkstatt") together with the author of the ''[[Nibelungenklage]]''.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=33}}{{sfn|Bumke|1996|pp=559, 590-595}} The latter work identifies a "meister Konrad" as the author of an original Latin version of the ''Nibelungenlied'', but this is generally taken for a fiction.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=58}} Although a single ''Nibelungenlied''-poet is often posited, the degree of variance in the text and its background in an amorphous oral tradition mean that ideas of authorial intention must be applied with caution.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=55}} It is also possible that there were several poets involved, perhaps under the direction of a single "leader" who could be considered the "''Nibelungenlied''-poet".{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1001}}

The ''Nibelungenlied'' is conventionally dated to around 1200: [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] references the cook Rumolt, usually taken as an invention of the ''Nibelungenlied''-poet, in his ''[[Parzival]]'' (c. 1204/5), giving a date by which the epic must have been composed. Additionally, the poem's rhyming technique most closely resembles that used between 1190 and 1205.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=185}} Attempts to show that the poem alludes to various historical events have generally not been convincing.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|pp=32-33}}

The current theory of the creation of the poem emphasizes the poet's concentration on the region of [[Passau]]: the poem highlights the relatively unimportant figure of bishop Pilgrim of Passau, and the poet's geographical knowledge appears much more firm for this area than for elsewhere. These facts, combined with the dating, have led scholars to believe that [[Wolfger von Erla]], bishop of Passau (reigned 1191-1204) was the patron of the poem. Wolfger is known to have patronized other literary figures, such as [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and [[Thomasin von Zirclaere]].{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=45-46}}The attention paid to bishop Pilgrim, who represents the real historical figure bishop [[Pilgrim of Passau]], would thus be an indirect homage to Wolfger. Wolfger was, moreover, attempting to establish the sainthood of Pilgrim at the time of the poem's composition, giving an additional reason for his prominence.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=186-187}}{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=33}}

Some debate exists as to whether the poem is an entirely new creation or whether there was a previous version. Jan-Dirk Müller is of the opinion that the poem in its written form is entirely new, although he admits the possibility that an orally transmitted epic with relatively consistent contents could have proceeded it.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=54}} Elisabeth Lienert, on the other hand, posits an earlier version of the text from around 1150 due to the ''Nibelungenlied's'' use of a stanzaic form current around that time (see [[#Form and style]]).{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=36}}

Whoever the poet may have been, he appears to have had a knowledge of German [[Minnesang]] and of [[chivalric romance]]. The poem's concentration on love (''minne'') and its depiction of Siegfried as engaging in [[love service]] for Kriemhild is in line with courtly romances of the time, with [[Heinrich von Veldeke]]'s ''Eneasroman'' perhaps providing concrete models. Another possible influence is [[Hartmann von Aue]]'s ''[[Iwein]]'',{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=32}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=201}}{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=81-87}} as well as ''[[Erec (poem)|Erec]]''. These courtly elements are described by Jan-Dirk Müller as something of a façade, under which the older heroic ethos of the poem remains.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=87-89}} Additionally, the poet seems to have known Latin literature. The role given to Kriemhild in the second (originally first) stanza is suggestive of [[Helen of Troy]], and the poem appears to have taken a number of elements from [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''.{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1012}} There is some debate as to whether the poet was acquainted with [[Old French]] ''[[chanson de geste]]''.{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1013}}

==Form and style==
The language of the ''Nibelungenlied'' is characterized by its formulaic nature, a feature of [[oral formulaic composition|oral poetry]]: this means that similar or identical words, epithets, phrases, even lines can be found in various positions throughout the poem. These elements can be used flexibly for different purposes in the poem. As the ''Nibelungenlied'' is generally thought to have been conceived as a written work, these elements are typically taken as signs of "fictive orality" ("fingierte Mündlichkeit") that underscore the connection of the poem to its traditionally oral subject matter.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=57-59}}

The ''Nibelungenlied'' is written in four-line stanzas. Although no melody has survived for the text, melodies for similar stanzas in other German heroic poems have, so that it is certain that the text was meant to be sung.{{snf|Millet|2008|p=191}} The stanza consists of three "Langzeilen" (long lines), which consist of three metrical feet, a [[caesura]], and three metrical feet following the caesura. The fourth line adds an additional foot following the caesura, making it longer than the other three and marking the end of the stanza. The final word before the caesura is typically female (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable), whereas the final word of a line is typical male (a stressed syllable). The lines rhyme in pairs, and occasionally there are internal rhymes between the words at the end of the caesura, as in the first stanza (see [[#Synopsis]]).{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=190-191}} Victor Millet prints the poem's sixth stanza as an example of the metrical form. An acute accent indicates the stressed beat of a metrical foot, and || indicates the caesura:

:Ze Wórmez bí dem Ríne || si wónten mít ir kráft.
:in díente vón ir lánden || vil stólziu ríterscáft
:mit lóbelíchen éren || unz án ir éndes zít.
:si stúrben sit jǽmerlíche || von zwéier édelen fróuwen nít.

Many stanzas of the poem are constructed in a much less regular manner.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=60}} It is likely that the ''Nibelungenlied'' cites an oral story-telling tradition in using singable stanzas; however, the longer final line is generally thought to belong to a more refined artistic milieu, as later heroic epics typically use a stanza without this longer final line (the so-called [[Jüngeres Hildebrandslied|"Hildebrandston"]]). The stanzaic form of the ''Nibelungenlied'', on the other hand, is shared with the Danubian [[Minnesang|minnesinger]] known as [[Der von Kürenberg]] who flourished in the 1150s and 1160s. The ''Nibelungenlied''-poet may have been inspired by this lyrical stanza. His use of the stanza would thus cite an oral story-telling tradition while at the same time creating some distance to it.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=191-192}} Andreas Heusler supposed that the poet had taken some earlier orally transmitted stanzas and added a fourth foot to their final line: these supposedly older stanzas are characterized by a more archaic vocabulary as well. Jan-Dirk Müller notes that while it would be typical of a medieval poet to incorporate lines from other works in his own, no stanza of the ''Nibelungenlied'' can be proven to have come from an older poem.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=61}}

The nature of the stanza creates a structure whereby the narrative progresses in blocks: the first three lines carry the story forward, while the fourth introduces foreshadowing of the disaster at the end or comments on events. The fourth line is thus often the most formulaic of the stanza.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=61}} Stanzas often seem to have been placed after each other without necessarily being causally or narratively connected; for instance, two consecutive stanzas might portray two different reactions to an event by the same figure. Often, the same reaction is given to multiple figures in different stanzas, so that the impression of collective rather than individual reactions is created.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=66-67}} [[Enjambment]] between stanzas is very rare.{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=194}} The epic frequently creates multiple motivations for events, some of which may contradict each other.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=67-68}} This style of narration also causes the events within the poem to come to a frequent halt, which can last for years within the time portrayed in the poem. The division of the epic into ''âventiuren'' ("books", literally "adventures") underlines the disconnect between the various episodes.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=194-195}} The connection between the first half (Siegfried's murder) and the second half of the epic (Kriemhild's marriage to Etzel) is especially loose. The epic nevertheless maintains the causal and narrative connection between episodes through the commentary of the narrator, who frequently reminds the poem's audience of the coming catastrophe, while the manner in which the epic is told serves to delay the inevitable disaster. The action becomes more and more intense as the epic nears its end.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=73-80}}

==Origins==
===Historical origins and development of the saga===
{{See also|Nibelung}}
Behind ''Nibelungenlied'' stands a large oral tradition, the so-called Nibelungen saga. This oral tradition, moreover, continued to exist following the composition of the ''Nibelungenlied'', as proven by the ''[[Rosengarten zu Worms]]'' and ''[[Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid]]'', both of which were written later than the ''Nibelungenlied'' but contain elements of the saga that are absent in it.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=32}} These oral traditions have, at least in some cases, a historical core. However, various historical events and figures have been melded together into a single plot in such a way that the original historical context has been lost. The epic, and presumably the oral traditions that provided its material, have transformed historical events into relatively simple narrative schemas that can be compared with other, similar (originally) oral narratives from other cultures.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=196-198}} What had originally been political motivations have been "personalized," so that political events are explained through personal preferences, likes, dislikes, and feuds rather than purely by Realpolitik.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=24-25}} Various historical personages, moreover, appear to be contemporaries despite not having lived at the same time historically.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|pp=18-19}}

The Nibelungen saga also seems to have had an early reception in Scandinavia,{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1010}} so that parallel stories are found among the [[heroic lay]]s of the [[Poetic Edda#Heroic lays|Poetic Edda]] (written down in 1270, but containing at least some much older material) and in the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' (second half of the thirteenth century). While the Norse texts were once usually considered to contain a more original version of the Nibelungen saga, newer scholarship has called this into question and notes that the connections made to [[Norse mythology]] and [[Germanic paganism]], such as the semi-divine origin of the Nibelungen hoard, are likely more recent developments that are therefore unique to the Scandinavian tradition.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=31}}{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1011}} Some elements of the Norse tradition, however, are assuredly older.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|pp=31-32}}

The death of the Burgundians finds its origins in the destruction of the historical [[Burgundians|Burgundian]] kingdom on the Rhine. This kingdom, under the rule of king [[Gundaharius]] was destroyed by the Roman general [[Flavius Aetius]] in 436/437, with survivors resettled in what later became the [[Franche-Comté]] of [[Burgundy]]. The ''[[Lex Burgundionum]]'', codified by the Burgundian king [[Gundobad]] at the end of the sixth century, contains many names that can be connected with the Nibelungen saga, including, besides Gundaharius, [[Gislaharius]] (Giselher), Gundomaris (possibly the historical figure behind the Old Norse Gothorm, who is replaced by Gernot in the German tradition), and [[Gibica]] (attested in Germany as Gibich but not found in the ''Nibelungenlied'').{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=19-20}} Although the Burgundian kingdom on the Rhine is thus historically attested, the saga locates its destruction at the court of [[Attila]] (Etzel), king of the [[Huns]]. The destruction of Attila's kingdom itself is likely inspired by Attila's sudden death following his wedding in 453, which was popularly blamed on his wife, a Germanic woman named Hildico. Her name, containing the element ''hild'' may have inspired that of Kriemhild.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=20}} Kriemhild most likely originally killed Etzel and avenged her relatives rather than her husband, but this change had already taken place some time before the creation of the ''Nibelungenlied''.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=35}} Jan-Dirk Müller doubts that we can be certain which version is more original given that in both cases Kriemhild brings about the destruction of the Hunnish kingdom. The differences may be because the continental saga is more favorable to Attila than the Norse, and so Attila could not be held directly responsible for the treacherous invitation of the Burgundians.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=33-34}}

Unlike the Burgundians, Siegfried cannot be firmly identified with a historical figure. He may have his origins in the [[Merovingian]] dynasty, where names beginning with the element ''Sigi-'' were common and where there was also a famous and violent queen [[Brunhilda of Austrasia|Brunhilda]] (543–613). The feud between this historical Brunhilda and the rival queen [[Fredegund]] may have provided the origin of the feud between Brünhild and Kriemhild.{{sfn|Haymes|Samples|1996|pp=21-22}} The name ''Siegfried'' itself is a relatively recent one, only being attested from the seventh century onward, meaning that the original name may have been equivalent to the Old Norse ''Sigurd''.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=22}} Scholars such as Otto Höfler have speculated that Siegfried and his slaying of the dragon may be a mythologized reflection of [[Arminius]] and his defeat of the Roman legions in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] in 9 AD. Jan-Dirk Müller suggests that Siegfried likely has a more mythological origin.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=22-23}} The story of the destruction of the Burgundians and Siegfried appear to have been originally unconnected. The Old Norse ''[[Atlakviða]]'', a poem likely originally from the ninth century that has been reworked as part of the Poetic Edda, tells the story of the death of the Burgundians without any mention of Sigurd (Siegfried) and can be taken as an attestation for an older tradition.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=31}}{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=48-52}} In fact, the earliest attested work to connect Siegfried explicitly with the destruction of the Burgundians is the ''Nibelungenlied'' itself, though Old Norse parallels make it clear that this tradition must have existed orally for some time.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=195-196}}

===The ''Nibelungenlied''-poet's reworking of the saga===
When composing the ''Nibelungenlied'', its poet was faced with setting an oral tradition down into a definitive version although that tradition was by its very nature amorphous. In choosing which elements of the saga to include in his version, the poet therefore often incorporated two versions of an event that were likely not combined in the oral tradition. An example is the beginning of the fighting in Etzel's hall, which is motivated both by 1) an attack on the Burgundians' supplies; 2) Hagen's killing of prince Ortlieb. The Old Norse ''[[Thidrekssaga]]'', which is based on German sources, contains only the second element, meaning that the two motivations were likely variants that were hardly ever combined in practice.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=37-40}} Victor Millet concludes that the poet deliberately doubles the motivations or occurrences of various events, including Siegfried's wooing of Kriemhild, the deception of Brünhild, Hagen's humiliation of Kriemhild, and Kriemhild's demand for the return of Nibelungen treasure.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=199-200}}

The poet also appears to have significantly altered various aspects of the saga. Most significantly, the poet has suppressed the mythological or fantastical elements of Siegfried's story. When these elements are introduced, it is in a retrospective tale narrated by Hagen that reduces the slaying of the dragon to a single stanza. Hagen's story, moreover, does not accord with Siegfried's youth as the narrator of the ''Nibelungenlied'' has portrayed it, in which he receives a courtly education in Xanten.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=202-203}} More elaborate stories about Siegfried's youth are found in the ''Thidrekssaga'' and in the later heroic ballad ''[[Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid]]'', both of which appear to preserve German oral traditions about the hero that the ''Nibelungenlied''-poet decided to suppress for his poem.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=23, 157-158}}

The portrayal of Kriemhild, particularly in the first half of the romance, as a courtly lady is likely an invention of the ''Nibelungenlied''-poet. Earlier (and many later) attestations of Kriemhild outside of the ''Nibelungenlied'' portray her as obsessed with power and highlight her treachery to her brothers rather than her love for her husband as her motivation for betraying them.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=201-202}} The poet still uses images from this traditional picture, but given the new motivation of the poem's Kriemhild, their meaning has changed. For instance, when Kriemhild demands that Hagen give back what he has taken from her, a traditional motif known from the Norse versions, she could mean the stolen hoard, but she could also mean her murdered husband. Hagen, similarly, in demanding that Gunther first be killed before he reveals the hoard's location, even though the hoard is at the bottom of the Rhine and cannot be retrieved, reveals Kriemhild's mercilessness while also showing his own duplicity. It is unclear which figure is in the right and which in the wrong.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=222-223}}

==Medieval influence and reception==
With 36 manuscripts, the ''Nibelungenlied'' appears to have been one of the most popular works of the German Middle Ages and seems to have found a very broad audience.{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1021}} The poem is quoted by [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] in his ''[[Parzival]]'' and ''[[Willehalm]]'', and likely inspired his use of stanzas in his unfinished ''[[Titurel]]''.{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|pp=1021-1022}} The manuscript witnesses and medieval references to the ''Nibelungenlied'' show that medieval recipients were most interested in the ''Nibelungenlied'' as the story of the destruction of the Burgundians; the first half of the poem was often shortened or otherwise summarized.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=49}} The [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]] titles its copy of the ''Nibelungenlied'' with "Ditz Puech heysset Chrimhilt" (this book is named "Kriemhild"), showing that she was seen as the most important character.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=91}}

The areas of medieval interest seem in particular to have been the inescapability of the slaughter at the end of the poem and Kriemhild and Hagen's culpability or innocence. The earliest attested reception of the ''Nibelungenlied'', the ''[[Nibelungenklage]]'', which was likely written only shortly afterwards, shows an attempt both to make sense of the horror of the destruction and to absolve Kriemhild of blame. The C version of the ''Nibelungenlied'', redacted around the same time as the ''Klage'', shows a similar strategy.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|pp=56-57}} The presence of the ''Nibelungenklage'' in all manuscripts of the ''Nibelungenlied'' shows that the ending of the ''Nibelungenlied'' itself was evidently unsatisfying to its primary audience without some attempt to explain these two "scandalous" elements.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=169}} The ''[[Rosengarten zu Worms]]'', on the other hand, demonizes Kriemhild thoroughly, while the late-medieval [[Das Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid|''Lied vom Hürnen Seyfrid'']] takes her side even more strongly.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=56, 69}}

As the first Middle High German heroic poem to be written, the ''Nibelungenlied'' can be said to have founded an entire genre of Middle High German literature. As a result, other Middle High German heroic poems are sometimes described as "post-Nibelungian" ("nachnibelungisch").{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=23}} The majority of these epics revolve around the hero [[Dietrich von Bern]], who plays a secondary role in the ''Nibelungenlied'': it is likely that his presence there inspired these new poems.{{sfn|Heinzle|2013|p=1022}} Many of the following heroic epics appear to respond to aspects of the ''Nibelungenlied'': the ''[[Kudrun]]'' (c. 1250), for instance, has been described as a reply to the ''Nibelungenlied'' that reverses the heroic tragedy of the previous poem. Kudrun herself is sometimes seen as a direct reversal of Kriemhild, as she makes peace among warring factions rather than driving them to their deaths.{{sfn|Millet|2008|pp=249-251}} No Middle High German heroic epic after the ''Nibelungenlied'' maintains the tragic heroic atmosphere that characterized earlier Germanic heroic poetry, and the later poems are often further hybridized with elements of [[chivalric romance]].{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=14, 57}}

Reception of the ''Nibelungenlied'' ceases after the fifteenth century: the work is last copied in manuscript as part of the [[Ambraser Heldenbuch]] around 1508, and its last mention is by the Viennese historian [[Wolfgang Lazius]] in two works from 1554 and 1557 respectively.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=179}} It was not printed and appears to have been forgotten. The Nibelungen saga, however, was not forgotten completely; the ''Rosengarten zu Worms'' was printed as part of the printed [[Heldenbuch]] until 1590 and inspired several plays in the early seventeenth century, while ''Hürnen Seyfrid'' continued to be printed into the nineteenth century in a prose version.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=67, 138}}

==Modern reception==

After having been forgotten for two hundred years, the ''Nibelungenlied'' manuscript C was rediscovered by Jacob Hermann Obereit in 1755.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=189}} That same year, [[Johann Jacob Bodmer]] publicized the discovery, publishing excerpts and his own reworkings of the poem. Bodmer dubbed the ''Nibelungenlied'' the "German ''[[Iliad]]''" ("deutsche Ilias"), a comparison that skewed the reception of the poem by comparing it to the poetics of classical epic. Bodmer attempted to make the ''Nibelungenlied'' conform more closely to these principles in his own reworkings of the poem, leaving off the first part in his edition, titled ''Chriemhilden Rache'', in order to imitate the ''[[in medias res]]'' technique of [[Homer]]. He later rewrote the second part in [[dactylic hexameter]] under the title ''Die Rache der Schwester'' (1767).{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=179-180}} Bodmer's placement of the ''Nibelungenlied'' in the tradition of classical epic had a detrimental effect on its early reception: when presented with a full edition of the medieval poem by Christoph Heinrich Myller, king [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] famously called the ''Nibelungenlied'' "not worth a shot of powder" ("nicht einen Schuß Pulver werth").{{sfn|Millet|2008|p=492}} [[Goethe]] was similarly unimpressed, and [[Hegel]] compared the epic unfavorably to Homer.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=180}} The epic nevertheless had its supporters, such as [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], who called it a "great tragedy" ("große Tragödie") in a series of lectures from 1802/3.{{sfn|Heinzle|1999|p=197}} Many early supporters sought to distance German literature from [[French Classicism]] and belonged to artistic movements such as ''[[Sturm und Drang]]''.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=181}}

As a consequence of the comparison of the ''Nibelungenlied'' to the ''Iliad'', the ''Nibelungenlied'' came to be seen as the German national epic in the earlier nineteenth century, particularly in the context of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The ''Nibelungenlied'' was supposed to embody German bourgeois virtues that the French were seen as lacking. This interpretation of the epic continued during the [[Biedermeier]] period, during which the heroic elements of the poem were mostly ignored in favor of those that could more easily be integrated into a bourgeois understanding of German virtue.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=180-182}} The translation of [[Karl Simrock]] into modern German in 1827 was especially influential in popularizing the epic and remains influential today.{{sfn|Whorbey|2018|p=vii}}{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=226}} Also notable from this period is the three-part dramatic tragedy ''Die Nibelungen'' by [[Friedrich Hebbel]].

Following the [[founding of the German Empire]], recipients began to focus more on the heroic aspects of the poem, with the figure of Siegfried in particular becoming an identifying figure for German nationalism. Especially important for this new understanding of the poem was [[Richard Wagner]]'s operatic cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', which, however, was based almost entirely on the Old Norse versions of the Nibelung saga. Wagner's preference for the Old Norse versions followed a popular judgment of the time period: the Nordic versions were seen as being more "original" than the courtly story portrayed in the German poem.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=32}} In the [[First World War]], the alliance between Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]] came to be described as possessing ''Nibelungen-Treue'' (Nibelungen loyalty), referring to the loyalty to death between Hagen and the Burgundians. While militaristic, the use of imagery from the ''Nibelungenlied'' remained optimistic in this period rather than focusing on the doom at the end of the epic.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=183}}

The interwar period saw the ''Nibelungenlied'' enter the world of cinema in [[Fritz Lang]]'s two part film ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924/1925), which tells the entire story of the poem. At the same time, the ''Nibelungenlied'' was heavily employed in anti-democratic propaganda following the defeat of Germany and Austria-Hungary: the epic supposedly showed that the German people were more well suited to a heroic, aristocratic form of life than democracy. The betrayal and murder of Siegfried was explicitly compared to the [[stab-in-the-back myth|"stab in the back"]] that the German army had supposedly received. At the same time, Hagen and his willingness to sacrifice himself and fight to the death made him into a central figure in the reception of the poem.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=183}} During the [[Second World War]], [[Hermann Göring]] would explicitly use this aspect of the ''Nibelungenlied'' to celebrate the sacrifice of the German army at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and compare the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] to Etzel's Asiatic Huns.{{sfn|Müller|2009|pp=183-184}}

Postwar reception and adaptation of the poem, reacting to its misuse by the Nazis, is often parodic. At the same time, the poem continues to play a role in regional culture and history, particularly in Worms and other places mentioned in the ''Nibelungenlied''. Much discussion has centered on whether and how the epic ought to be taught in schools.{{sfn|Müller|2009|p=184}} The material of the Nibelungen saga has continued to inspire new adaptations. These include ''[[Die Nibelungen (1966-67 film)|Die Nibelungen]]'', a German remake of Fritz Lang's film from 1966/67, and the television film ''[[Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King]]'' from 2004. However, the majority of popular adaptations of the material today in film, computer games, comic books, etc., are not based on the medieval epic directly.{{sfn|Lienert|2015|p=190}}

Outside of Germany, most reception of the Nibelungen material has taken place via Wagner, although the epic has been translated into English numerous times.{{sfn|Gentry|McConnell|Müller|Wunderlich|2011|p=222}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5370">In [[mathematics education]], '''number sense''' can refer to "an intuitive understanding of numbers, their magnitude, relationships, and how they are affected by operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnnc.org/glossary/number+sense|title=number sense}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of number sense emphasize an ability to work outside of the traditionally taught algorithms, e.g., "a well organised conceptual framework of number information that enables a person to understand numbers and number relationships and to solve mathematical problems that are not bound by traditional algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=2477&amp;part=index|title=What is number sense?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists believe that the number sense in humans can be differentiated into the [[approximate number system]], a system that supports the estimation of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], and the [[parallel individuation system]], which allows the tracking of individual objects, typically for quantities below 4.&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M.|title=Neurocognitive start-up tools for symbolic number representations|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.008|pages=542–551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some differences in how number sense is defined in math [[cognition]]. For example, Gersten and Chard say number sense "refers to a child's fluidity and flexibility with numbers, the sense of what numbers mean and an ability to perform mental mathematics and to look at the world and make comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/article/5838|title=Number Sense: Rethinking Arithmetic Instruction for Students with Mathematical Disabilities }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ695626|title=Making Sense of Number Sense: Implications for Children With Mathematical Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edletter.org/insights/stages.shtml|title=Stages in Development of Number Sense - Harvard Education Letter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-human animals, number sense is not the ability to count, but the ability to perceive changes in the number of things in a collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.twsu.edu/history/topics/num-sys.html#sense|title=Number Systems|website=www.math.twsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All mammals, and most birds, will notice if there is a change in the number of their young nearby. Many birds can distinguish two from three.&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, Tobias. Number: The Language of Science. New York: Macmillan Company, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;
In humans, small children around fourteen months of age are also able to notice something that is missing from a group that they are familiar with.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Researchers consider number sense to be of prime importance for children in early [[elementary education]], and the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] has made number sense a focus area of pre-K through 2nd grade mathematics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fayar.net/east/teacher.web/math/Illuminations/reflections/prek2/E_NumberSense/index.html|title=Understanding a Child's Development of Number Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An active area of research is to create and test teaching strategies to develop children's number sense. Number sense also refers to the contest hosted by the [[University Interscholastic League]].  This contest is a ten-minute test where contestants solve math problems mentally—no calculators, scratch-work, or mark-outs are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uiltexas.org/academics/number-sense|title=UIL Number Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts involved in number sense==
The term ''"number sense"'' involves several concepts of [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[ranking]], [[Comparison (mathematics)|comparison]], [[measurement]], [[rounding]], [[percent]]s, and [[estimation]], including:&lt;ref name="stpsb"&gt;"Unit 1: Number and Number Sense" (20-day lesson),
  STPSB.org, St. Tammany Parish School Board,
  [[Covington, LA]] (USA), 2009, overview webpage:
  [http://www.stpsb.org/files/MathGrade7Unit1090120034917.htm ST-MathGrade7Unit-topics].
&lt;/ref&gt;
* estimating with large numbers to provide reasonable approximations;
* judging the degree of precision appropriate to a situation;
* rounding (understanding reasons for rounding large numbers and limitations in comparisons);
* choosing measurement units to make sense for a given situation;
* solving real-life problems involving percentages and decimal portions;
* comparing physical measurements within and between the U.S. and [[metric system]]s; and
* comparing degrees [[Fahrenheit]] and [[Celsius]] in real-life situations.&lt;ref name=stpsb/&gt;
Those concepts are taught in elementary-level education.

'''''Persona 3'''''{{refn|{{nihongo|'''''Persona 3'''''|ペルソナ3|Perusona Surī}}}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Atlus]], and chronologically the fourth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, a subseries of the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. ''Persona 3'' was originally published in 2006 on the [[PlayStation 2]] by Atlus in Japan; the North American release of the game was delayed until 2007 due to issues with the publication of the official art book. ''[[Persona 3 FES]]'', a director's cut version containing a new playable [[epilogue]] among other changes, was released in Japan in 2007 and worldwide the following year.

In ''Persona 3'', the player takes the role of a [[Protagonist (Persona 3)|male high-school student]] who joins the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a group of students investigating the Dark Hour, a time period between one day and the next that few people are aware of. During the Dark Hour, the player enters Tartarus, a large tower containing Shadows, creatures that feed on the minds of humans. To fight the Shadows, each member of SEES is able to summon a Persona, a manifestation of a person's inner self. The game's most iconic feature is the method by which the members of SEES release their Personas: by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head. In addition to the standard elements of role-playing games, ''Persona 3'' includes elements of [[Simulation video game|simulation games]], as the game's protagonist progresses day by day through a school year, making friends and forming relationships that improve the strength of his Personas in battle.

Reception of ''Persona 3'' was mainly positive; critics enjoyed the game's social elements, while some found its combat and environments repetitive. ''Persona 3 FES''{{'s}} epilogue was said to give narrative closure to the original game, although it was criticized for not featuring the simulation aspect of ''Persona 3''. A [[PlayStation Portable]] version of ''Persona 3'', titled ''[[Persona 3 Portable]]'' was released in Japan in November 2009, in North America in July 2010, and in Europe in April 2011. The [[Video game remake|remake]] adds the ability to play as a female protagonist, new story elements and music, and a new interface designed for the PSP. Two [[fighting game]]s that continued the storyline of select members of SEES, ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'' and ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]'', were released in the early 2010s. ''Persona 3'' has also seen related forms of media released, including a rhythm game spinoff, multiple soundtrack albums, musical concerts and [[Radio drama in Japan|radio dramas]], a [[manga]] adaption, an [[Persona: Trinity Soul|anime series]], and an [[Persona 3 The Movie: No. 1, Spring of Birth|episodic animated film series]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Persona3library.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|The Protagonist gains academic skills by studying in the school library. The upper-right area of the screen indicates the current date, time period, and phase of the moon.|alt=A teenage boy with blue hair sits at a desk in his school's library, studying. The dialogue box in the lower-third of the screen reads "You managed to solve a difficult problem!" The top-right area of the screen denotes that the date is June 8, the current time period is "After School", and the moon is full.]]

''Persona 3'' combines elements of traditional role-playing games and [[simulation video game|simulation games]]. The game follows the protagonist character, balancing their daily life of going to school and building relationships with other people with fighting evil beings known as Shadows during the mysterious Dark Hour. Each day is divided up between various time zones, the most common of which are "After School/Daytime" and "Evening". With the exception of scripted events, such as plot progression or special events, the player is free to choose how each day is spent, with most activities causing time to pass on. The types of activities and characters that can be interacted with vary depending on the day of the week and time of day. Additionally, some activities are limited by the protagonist's three attributes; Academics, Charm, and Courage, which can be built by performing various activities or making certain correct choices.&lt;ref name="manual28"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |page=28 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manual25"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |page=25 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the evening, players can choose to visit Tartarus, the game's main dungeon, where they can build their party's experience and gain new items. On the day of the full moon, players will participate in a boss battle in order to progress the story.&lt;ref name="1UP-Persona 3 Preview"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ray |last=Barnholt |title=Previews: Persona 3 |url=http://www.1up.com/previews/persona-3 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=May 8, 2007 |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018004736/http://www.1up.com/previews/persona-3 |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personas and Social Links===
The main element of the game are the Personas, various creatures and monsters which are associated with the [[Major Arcana]] of the [[Tarot]].&lt;ref name="Gamespot-Persona 3 Review" /&gt; Each Persona has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, and possess various abilities, ranging from offensive and support abilities, to passive abilities that support the character. Whereas each of the game's main characters has their own Persona, some of which change form as the story progresses,&lt;!-- If you can, cite this: The Persona of each character (excluding the Protagonist) will change to a new, more powerful Persona during key game events.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} --&gt; the protagonist is capable of wielding multiple Personas, which can be switched between during battles.&lt;ref name="manual2627"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |pages=26–27 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Personas can be created by visiting the Velvet Room and fusing together multiple Personas, passing along certain moves from the Personas used. The Personas that a player can create are limited by the current level of the protagonist.&lt;ref name="manual2627" /&gt;&lt;ref name="manual3839" /&gt; Personas can also be obtained from Shuffle Time following battles, and previously obtained Personas can be summoned from the Persona Compendium for a fee.&lt;ref name="manual3839"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |pages=38–39 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Velvet Room additionally allows players to take on quests, such as retrieving certain items, in order to obtain a reward.

New to the series are {{nihongo|Social Links|コミュ|komyu, lit. "commu", short for "community"}}, bonds that are formed with several of the game's characters, with each Social Link representing a specific Major Arcana. By spending time with these characters, these Social Links increase in rank. When creating a Persona of a particular Arcana, an experience bonus will be granted if that Arcana possesses a Social Link, with greater bonuses awarded depending on the rank. Performing certain activities or carrying a Persona of a respective Arcana can help bring a Social Link closer to increasing in Rank. Maxing out a Social Link gives players the ability to create specific Personas of each Arcana. Conversely, negative actions, such as incorrect dialogue choices or dating multiple characters, can result in a Reversed Social Link, which can prevent players from summoning Personas of that Arcana until fixed. In the worst-case scenario, a Reversed Social Link can break, effectively removing all Personas of that Arcana from the game.

===Tartarus and Combat===
[[File:Persona 3 battle screen.png|thumb|200px|right|A typical battle in ''Persona 3''. The portraits on the right-hand side of the screen indicate the status of the player's party.|alt=Four of the game's playable characters surround a group of three enemies. The camera is centered behind the Protagonist, who is wielding a sword. A wheel-shaped menu of icons in the lower-left corner of the screen indicate available battle commands.]]
Tartarus is the game's main dungeon, which can be visited during the evening, provided the conditions allow it (e.g. the absence of some characters may prevent the player from visiting Tartarus that night).&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 Review"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Haynes |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Review |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/807/807769p1.html |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=July 24, 2007 |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012014902/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/807/807769p1.html |archivedate=October 12, 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player may order the other party members to split up to explore the area, or automatically attack Shadows on sight. Players will eventually come across boss floors, in which the player must defeat powerful Shadows in order to continue their progress. Additionally, certain floors halt further progress through the tower until the story progresses.&lt;ref name="manual2021"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |pages=20–21 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, innocent civilians will wander into Tartarus, winding up on certain floors. Rescuing these civilians safely before a full moon appears grants bonus rewards obtained from the police station. Spending too much time in Tartarus may cause characters to become "Tired" or "Sick", which can affect their performance during battle. Additionally, if the protagonist becomes Tired or Sick, some activities, such as studying at night, may be hampered. Players can recover their status by taking certain items, visiting the infirmary, or going to bed early.&lt;ref name="manual2021" /&gt;

Battle occurs when the player comes into contact with a Shadow roaming the floor, with the battle party consisting of whoever is in close proximity. Attacking the Shadow without being noticed will give the player an advantage, whilst the enemy gains an advantage if the player is attacked first.&lt;ref name="manual22"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |page=22 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battles use the "Press Turn" system, in which both allies and enemies take turns to attack using weapons, items, or Persona abilities.&lt;ref name="Gamespot-Persona 3 Review"&gt;{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=VanOrd |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3/1900-6175580/ |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=July 24, 2007 |accessdate=December 16, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141201180049/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3/1900-6175580/ |archivedate=December 1, 2014 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Tactics option, the player can assign specific battle AI to each party member (in ''Persona 3 Portable'', they may also choose to issue direct commands).&lt;ref name="manual3132"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |pages=31–32 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offensive attacks are divided into three physical types; Strike, Slash, and Pierce, and six elements; Fire, Ice, Electricity, Wind, Light, and Dark, attributes of which both Personas and Shadows may possess strengths and weaknesses against. Physical abilities use up HP whilst elemental and support magic use SP. By exploiting an enemy's weakness or performing a critical attack, characters can knock the opponent down, granting that character an extra turn, though enemies can also take advantage of an ally's weakness to gain an additional turn.&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 Review"/&gt; If the player manages to knock all opponents down, they may be granted the opportunity to perform an All-Out Attack, in which all able party members assault the enemies for massive damage.&lt;ref name="Gamespot-Persona 3 Review"/&gt; Allies who lose all of their HP can be revived using revival items and abilities, but if the protagonist loses all of their HP, the game will end.

When a battle is won, players gain experience points which are divided amongst the party members. Earning enough experience allows Personas to increase in level, granting improved stats and new abilities.&lt;ref name="manual2627" /&gt; Some Personas may also grant Skill Cards, which can be given to other Personas to teach them new abilities. Raising the protagonist's level will allow higher level Personas to be summoned in the Velvet Room, as well as allow the player to carry more Personas. At the end of certain battles, a minigame known as Shuffle Time may appear, in which players select a card from a set that is shuffled around. These can grant bonuses, such as additional experience points, cash, or restored health, or give the player new Personas. However, selecting a cursed card will cause an extremely powerful monster, Death or better known as the Reaper, to appear on the current floor.

==Plot==

===Setting===
The story of ''Persona 3'' takes place in a 2009 Japanese city called {{nihongo|Iwatodai|巖戸台}}, built and funded by the Kirijo Corporation. Several experiments carried out ten years ago created the {{nihongo|Dark Hour|影時間|kage jikan, lit. "Shadow Hour"}}, a period of time that exists between one day and the next.&lt;ref name="manual0405"&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES North American instruction manual |publisher=[[Atlus|Atlus U.S.A, Inc.]] |pages=04–05 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, most people turned into coffins and they are not aware of the Dark Hour; however, there is a select group of people who are.&lt;ref name="manual0405" /&gt;  The Dark Hour bends reality; Gekkoukan High School, where most of the characters attend school during the day, becomes a huge labyrinthine tower called Tartarus, and beasts known as Shadows roam the area, preying on the minds of those still conscious.&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 Review" /&gt; The Shadows leave their victims in near-catatonic states outside of the Dark Hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title='''Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3''' |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Mitsuru:''' A Shadow feeds on the mind of its prey; the victim becomes a living corpse. They're responsible for most of the incidents on the news, if not all of them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To investigate and learn about the Dark Hour, Shadows, and Tartarus, the "Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad", or SEES, was created.  SEES is a group of high-schoolers capable of summoning beings known as Personas to combat Shadows.&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 Review" /&gt;  The ''Persona 3'' instruction manual describes Persona's being "a second soul that dwells deep within a person's heart.  It is an entirely different personality that emerges when a person is confronted with something from outside this world."&lt;ref name="manual0405" /&gt;  Persona-users usually summon their Persona by firing a gun-like object called an Evoker at their head.&lt;ref name="1UP-Persona 3 Preview" /&gt;

===Story===
Persona 3 begins with the Protagonist transferring to Gekkoukan High School, and moving into a dorm in the city.&lt;ref name="manual0405" /&gt; After learning of his ability to summon a Persona, he is asked to join SEES, and is eventually elected its leader in combat. Additional members join SEES over time, all students attending Gekkoukan: Junpei, who had only recently discovered his ability to summon a Persona; Akihiko, whose arm injury prevented him from fighting; and Fuuka, who replaces Mitsuru as the team's support member. After awakening to his Persona ability, the Protagonist is transported to the Velvet Room, which its proprietor, Igor, says is a realm between "dream and reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Igor:''' This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter...

It's like the number zero... It's empty, but at the same time holds infinite possibilities. You, my boy, are able to possess multiple Personas, and summon them as needed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In-game, the Velvet Room is where the player may fuse two or more Personas to create a new one. Igor also encourages the Protagonist to meet people and form bonds with them, known as Social Links.  According to Igor, the power of his Social Links will determine his potential in combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Igor:''' The ability evolves as you develop your Social Links--your emotional ties with others.

On nights when the moon is full, the city is attacked by a Shadow more powerful than the ones found in Tartarus. After several of these incidents, Mitsuru is forced to reveal to the team the origin of Tartarus and the Dark Hour.  Ten years earlier, the Kirijo Group, a research company founded by Mitsuru's grandfather, began amassing and containing Shadows. They studied and performed experiments on them, in order to harness their power. However, the experiments went awry, allowing the Shadows to escape and assemble into twelve larger creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Mitsuru:''' My grandfather was obsessed with Shadows. He wanted to harness their power, and create something extraordinary. / '''Fuuka:''' Harness their power? / '''Mitsuru:''' He assembled a team of scientists, and over several years collected a significant number of Shadows. / '''Junpei:''' He what!? Damn, that's freaking crazy! / '''Mitsuru:''' However... Ten years ago, during the final stages of the experiment, they lost control of the Shadows' power. Consequently, the nature of the world was altered. / '''Fuuka:''' You mean... / '''Mitsuru:''' Yes... Tartarus and the Dark Hour... By their account, the mass of Shadows they collected split into several large ones that then dispersed. These are the Shadows we've been encountering on nights when the moon is full.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each is affiliated with one of the twelve [[Major Arcana]].  SEES's leader, Shuji Ikutsuki, informs them that, if they were to defeat all twelve of the greater Shadows, Tartarus and the Dark Hour would disappear forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Shuji Ikutsuki:''' What if I told you that those twelve Shadows are the cause of everything? / '''Akihiko:''' Then, if we defeat them all, Tartarus and the Dark Hour will disappear...? / '''Shuji Ikutsuki:''' Exactly! That's what I was going to tell you earlier. See, it's good news, isn't it?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the year continues, the group adds two more Persona-users to their team: Ken and Koromaru. While vacationing in [[Yakushima]], Junpei, Akihiko, and the Protagonist encounter Aigis, who had recently escaped the laboratory where she was kept, despite having been deactivated for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Shuji Ikutsuki:''' She suffered major damage in combat and has remained in the lab ever since.

After defeating the twelfth and final Shadow, SEES learns that they had been misled by Shuji Ikutsuki. By destroying the greater Shadows, they have freed parts of a being known as Nyx, which will bring about the end of the world if it is fully restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Akihiko:''' You said the Dark Hour and Tartarus would disappear if we defeated the 12 Shadows.

Unfortunately, your realization has come too late. / '''Yukari:''' No... / '''Ken:''' ...You tricked us!? / '''Shuji Ikutsuki:''' Everything is as I planned... It is not unexpected that the Dark Hour and Tartarus remain. In fact, I never intended for you to rid the world of them. Quite the opposite, actually. / '''Fuuka:''' What do you mean? / '''Shuji Ikutsuki:''' The 12 Shadows were parts of a whole... They were destined to be reunited. ...And that was accomplished in no small part, thanks to your efforts. Soon, Death, the almighty, shall arise and bring forth the Fall...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nyx, or the "maternal being", is the creator of Shadows; she is drawn to Earth by The Appriser, or "Death", a Shadow of the Death arcanum. SEES encounters The Appriser disguised as Ryoji Mochizuki, a recent transfer student to Gekkoukan High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Mitsuru:''' ...You know the "truth" about Shadows? / '''Ryoji:''' Yes.

The Shadow experiments performed ten years earlier created the Death Shadow, albeit in an incomplete state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Ryoji:''' Ten years ago, a man collected a great number of Shadows and contained them in a laboratory...

Its purpose is to usher Nyx into the world, who will bring about the extinction of all life on Earth. Ryoji insists that Nyx cannot be defeated; however, he offers SEES an alternative. If they were to kill him, their memories of the Dark Hour and Tartarus would vanish, allowing them to continue life unaware of their impending death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Ryoji:''' Nyx's coming cannot be avoided.

You won't remember anything.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aigis, who now realizes why she wanted to protect the Protagonist, begins to believe that she is useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Aigis:''' Why...?

Through encouragement from her friends, however, she gains the resolve to join with SEES as they attempt to fight Nyx.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Aigis:''' This is the promise I've made to myself.

I will be with you all... no matter what happens...!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, [[New Year's Eve]], the player must decide whether to kill Ryoji or spare his life. If the protagonist kills him, the game cuts to Graduation Day, with the entirety of SEES (barring Aigis) losing their memories of the Dark Hour and the Shadows, ending on a dark note as they prepare to celebrate in blissful ignorance until Nyx inevitably brings about The Fall and all of humanity dies. If he is spared, then the game continues, and on January 31, SEES ascends to the roof of Tartarus to face Ryoji, who has transformed into the Nyx Avatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Aigis:''' You are... / '''Yukari:''' Ryoji-kun...!? / '''Nyx Avatar:''' That was my name for a time...

Although, Nyx and myself are now {{sic|one in}} the same.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they are able to defeat him, Nyx continues to descend to Earth. As this is happening, the Protagonist is summoned to the Velvet Room, where Igor reminds him that the power of his Social Links would determine his potential.  The Protagonist hears the voices of his friends encouraging him.  The strength of his Social Links grants him the power of the "Universe", allowing him to seal away Nyx from humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Igor:''' Behold the last power you and I shall unveil...

Nothing is outside the realm of possibility for you now.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The world returns to normal, though the memories of the past year related to the Dark Hour are lost to the members of SEES. However, Aigis and the Protagonist do remember. On Graduation Day, the two go to the roof of the school, where the members of SEES had promised to meet should they stop Nyx and live to see their graduation. As Mitsuru gives her graduation speech, she and the rest of SEES suddenly regain their memories, and the group rush to the roof to fulfill the promise they all made. It is here that Aigis thanks the Protagonist for giving her a purpose in life: protecting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |developer=[[Atlus]] |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Aigis:''' When I thought I might never see you again, something else became clear to me--what I wanted most.

My life will be worth living if it's for this reason... Thank you...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Answer====
The events of The Answer begin on March 31, shortly after the end of the original game.  During the opening sequence, it is revealed that the Protagonist has died;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://g4tv.com/games/ps2/43629/Shin-Megami-Tensei-Persona-3-FES/review/ |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Fes Review |publisher=[[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] |accessdate=August 30, 2009 |date=April 7, 2008 |time=0:30 |quote=The new adventure is called "Episode Aegis."

It just seemed like he fell asleep, didn't it? /'''Fuuka:''' He must've used up all his power to protect us...at that last battle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school year has ended, and the dorm is to be closed down soon. Aigis reveals to the group that she will not be attending school next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Fuuka:''' Huh? The lab...? Are you planning to commute to school from there next semester? / '''Aigis:''' Oh... No, I... / '''Mitsuru:''' Aigis is returning herself to the lab tomorrow. She...won't be enrolled as a senior.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their last dinner party, the SEES members discover that they are trapped in their dorm, and that the day March 31 is repeating itself.&lt;ref name="Gamespot-Persona 3 FES Review" /&gt;  Later, a large door-like hole opens in the floor of the dorm, and SEES is attacked by Metis, an anti-shadow weapon similar to Aigis.  In the midst of fighting Metis to protect her friends, Aigis's Persona, [[Athena]], transforms into [[Orpheus]], the original Persona of the Protagonist. She also gains the Protagonist's Wild Card ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Igor:''' In awakening to the power of the Wild Card, you are now bound to a contract. From this moment forth, you are our guest in the Velvet Room. / '''Aigis:''' Wild Card...? / '''Igor:''' Surely you know of which I speak: the ability to hold multiple Personas and wield their powers. Until recently, a young man with the same talent [the Protagonist of ''Persona 3''] was our guest here. / '''Aigis:''' ''[standing up in surprise]'' You...know of him? / '''Igor:''' Indeed I do.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aigis is able to subdue Metis, whose actions were an attempt to end the time skip and save Aigis, who she calls her "sister".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Metis:''' The only way to survive is to somehow find a way to eradicate the Abyss of Time. / '''Ken:''' Eradicate it? How're we supposed to do that...? /'''Metis:''' I've already tried the simplest, most direct way: eliminating all of you. The Abyss of Time connected to this dorm, as if drawn to it. That, together with the way you can all perceive the time skips...it seems clear to me that you have a lot to do with the reason for this happening.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Metis:''' Um...Aigis? I promise to listen to what you say, so...could I...call you Sister...? / '''Aigis:''' Go right ahead. / '''Metis:''' Thank you...Sister!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underneath the dorm is the Abyss of Time, the cause of the time skip. The Abyss contains seven doors, the insides of which contain multi-floor dungeons, similar in design to Tartarus; it is in these areas that the game's combat takes place.&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 FES Review" /&gt;  At the top of each dungeon, the characters witness an event from the past of a member of SEES.  After seeing several of these [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], the characters discern that the event shown in each door relates to how that person had awakened to their Persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Yukari:''' Ken-kun's story, Akihiko-senpai's story...Junpei's and Koromaru's, too.

I'm not following you here... / '''Yukari:''' What we've seen is each of our reasons for awakening to our Persona.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the top of the seventh and final door, SEES fights a Shadow-like version of the Protagonist. After defeating it, each of them obtain a key. By combining the keys, they would be able to end the time skip and leave the dorm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Metis:''' You should be able to leave using those keys. Once you make it outside, the Abyss of Time should disappear on its own.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Metis presents SEES with an alternative: instead of unlocking the front door of the dorm, they may also use the keys to travel back in time, to before the fight against Nyx and the death of the Protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Junpei:''' You're all about the here and now, right, Yuka-tan?

We're never gonna reach an agreement. So if no one gives in...we'll have to settle this another way. / '''Fuuka:''' Another way...? Yukari-chan...you don't mean—!? / '''Yukari:''' Taking the keys by force... That'll work too, right?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aigis, Fuuka and Metis claim all eight keys, which fuse into the Final Key. After debating on what to do now, they discover a third, new door in the Abyss of Time, which the group uses (without the Final Key) to travel to the moment the Protagonist sealed Nyx from the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Aigis:''' So this...is the miracle he performed. / '''Fuuka:''' What... What is this? /'''Metis:''' ...This is his life essence. As you can see, this is what happened. He himself became the Great Seal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metis explains that the purpose of the seal created by the Protagonist was not to seal away Nyx herself (who is not inherently evil), but to prevent humanity's despair from calling out to Nyx and bringing about the Fall once more. The subconscious will of mankind to despair and wish for death constantly rebirths a monster called Erebus that summons Nyx to destroy the world; Metis implies that Erebus's contact with Nyx is what caused the Fall (that was prevented by SEES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Fuuka:'''  This...isn't a Shadow... So many... All those people's... /'''Metis:''' As I thought: the seal's real purpose. It wasn't to hold back Nyx; it was a seal so that it couldn't be touched. / '''Mitsuru:''' What do you mean? / '''Fuuka:''' That monster...isn't a Shadow. It's the accumulated malice that came from the hearts of countless living people. All of them...deep down are calling Nyx!}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEES realizes that the wishes that created Erebus also came from them, and so they fight it, and are able to defeat it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Metis:''' Don't tell me you're going to fight that thing!

Because I couldn't accept reality, I foolishly sought solace in a past filled with death and strife. There's no mistaking it: this monster is the reason for all our troubles. / '''Akihiko:''' You got that right. If we run away from this, we're off to a lousy start for our future. / '''Ken:''' That's what I think too... This was already a battle against myself.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsuru points out that Erebus will return, as humans will never stop wishing for death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Mitsuru:''' To stop the heart's yearning for destruction...it's a formidable task.

It may be that there's no way to fully eliminate this monster.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After breaking the time skip and exiting through the front door of the dorm with the Final Key, Metis, Aigis, and the rest of SEES are summoned to the Velvet Room, much to Igor's (pleasant) surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game |developer=[[Atlus]] |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |date=August 14, 2007 |quote='''Junpei:''' Hey, wait a second!

It also profiled three characters—the Protagonist, Junpei, and Yukari—as well as their respective Personas: Orpheus, Hermes and Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2006/031706a.html |title=New Details, New Story for the Newest Persona |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |last=Sloderbeck |first=Matt |author2=Adrienne Beck |date=March 17, 2006 |publisher=RPGamer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206173021/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q1-2006/031706a.html |archivedate=February 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main character artist and art director for ''Persona 3'' was [[Shigenori Soejima]].&lt;ref name="SoejimaInterview"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Shigenori Soejima Interview |title=Shigenori Soejima Art Works 2004-2010 |publisher=Udon Entertainment |isbn=978-1926778327 |pages=145–153 |date=July 1, 2010}} [https://megatengaku.wordpress.com/readings/artbooks/shigenori-soejima-art-works-2004-2010/ Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621210120/https://megatengaku.wordpress.com/readings/artbooks/shigenori-soejima-art-works-2004-2010/ |date=June 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Character artist for the previous ''Persona'' titles, [[Kazuma Kaneko]], gave the job to Soejima so he could gain more experience.&lt;ref name="OtakuKaneko"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kemps, Heidi |date=August 2008 |title=Game King: An Interview with Kazuma Kaneko |journal=[[Otaku USA]] |issue=Vol. 2, Issue 1 |pages=120–123 |publisher=Sovereign Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soejima felt a degree of pressure when designing the characters as he did not want to disappoint the series' fanbase. The goal was to make players of the ''Megami Tensei'' series feel gratified that they had supported the ''Persona'' series. In an interview, Soejima compared the game's aesthetic and style to a fantastical [[manga]], citing its use of mecha-like Persona and Mitsuru's flamboyant styling. Soejima returned to design the character Metis for ''FES''.&lt;ref name="SoejimaInterview"/&gt; The user interface was designed to stand out during the game's marketing, with its blue-colored design intended to evoke a cool and stylish atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/13/atlus-reveals-design-secrets-behind-persona-5s-distinctive-ui/ |title=Atlus Reveals The Design Secrets Behind Persona 5's Distinctive UI |author=Wong, Alistair |publisher=Siliconera |date=November 13, 2017 |accessdate=November 13, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113195500/http://www.siliconera.com/2017/11/13/atlus-reveals-design-secrets-behind-persona-5s-distinctive-ui/ |archivedate=November 13, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anime cutscenes for ''Persona 3'' and ''FES'' were animated by animation production company Point Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.point-p.jp/record/ |script-title=ja:アニメーション制作スタジオ ポイント・ピクチャーズ – Point Pictures |publisher=Point Pictures |accessdate=July 31, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731224443/http://www.point-p.jp/record/ |archivedate=July 31, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the magazine ''[[Play (US magazine)|Play]]'', lead director for ''Persona 3'' [[Katsura Hashino]] discussed why the decision was made to have party members be directed by an [[artificial intelligence]]: "I think it's more fun to have the party members controlled by their AI, so each member's characteristics and personality are on vivid display. There were no objections raised among the Persona 3 development team, either."  He also notes that the system "wasn't well received" by players of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.Content&amp;contentid=1413 |title=Interview – Katsura Hashino |publisher=[[Play (US magazine)|Play]] |accessdate=August 22, 2009 |date=March 5, 2009 |last=Patterson |first=Eric |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328002518/http://mag.gomorning.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.Content&amp;contentid=1413 |archivedate=March 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the use of AI for the secondary party members was described as a stylistic choice representing the game's theme of conquering the fear of death through "bonds": each character was their own person, and the player could only influence things by interacting with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 The Official Strategy Guide |publisher=DoubleJump Publishing |isbn=978-0979884863 |pages=302–303 |date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Persona 3'' does not include the negotiation elements of previous ''Persona'' or ''Megami Tensei'' games, which allowed players to talk to enemies during a battle to recruit them, earn money, or obtain items.  However, the social elements of ''Persona 3'' (and its successor, ''[[Persona 4]]'') are considered the equivalent of the negotiation system by the development team. Maragos said in a [[1UP.com]] interview that "negotiation isn't gone...And [it] still factors into Persona Fusion; it's still a big part of the game. I feel like it's disguised, but it's there."&lt;ref name="1UP-p4localinterview" /&gt;

===Localization===
The [[Language localisation|localization]] of ''Persona 3'' was handled by Yu Namba and Nich Maragos. During this process, the team worked to leave as much of the original Japanese content intact, continuing a trend started with ''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]''. One of the ideas had by the team for ''Persona 3'' was to use it as a medium for introducing Japanese culture to a western audience.&lt;ref name="DesPanel"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "SMTnamba"/&gt; While localizing ''Persona 3'' for English-speaking countries, the [[Japanese honorifics|honorifics]] used by the characters in the original Japanese script were retained. According to Maragos, their use "[added] so much more meaning to the text".&lt;ref name="1UP-p4localinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/anime-expo-atlus-talks-persona |title=Anime Expo: Atlus Talks Persona 4, Trauma Center's Future |last=Fitch |first=Andrew |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |date=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6JOrE1tSh?url=http://www.1up.com/news/anime-expo-atlus-talks-persona |archivedate=September 5, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview with RPGamer, project editor Yu Namba explained that during the process of translation, some of the Japanese humor, "things that made absolutely no sense in western culture…were replaced with jokes that at least somewhat parallel the originals."&lt;ref name="RPGamer-p3interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q2-2007/060307b.html |title=Run to the Sun – Atlus Interview |publisher=RPGamer |date=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112123124/http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q2-2007/060307b.html |archivedate=January 12, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the changes that needed to be made was to the school tests, which were based around questions on the English language. A similar change was Mitsuru's second language: in the original version it was English, but for the localized version her second language was changed to French. This choice was influenced by her cultured appearance. In addition, in-game references to the original ''[[Shin Megami Tensei]]'' were altered to references to ''[[Revelations: Persona]]''.&lt;ref name="DesPanel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/anime-expo-08-atlus-shin-megami-tensei-panel-94038.phtml |title=Anime Expo '08: Atlus' Shin Megami Tensei panel |author=North, Dale |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=July 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172351/http://www.destructoid.com/anime-expo-08-atlus-shin-megami-tensei-panel-94038.phtml |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "SMTnamba"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/20/localizing-persona-an-interview-with-atluss-yu-namba/ |title=Localizing Persona: An Interview With Atlus's Yu Namba |author=Ward, Robert |publisher=Siliconera |date=July 20, 2015 |accessdate=July 20, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720213530/http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/20/localizing-persona-an-interview-with-atluss-yu-namba/ |archivedate=July 20, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The soundtrack for ''Persona 3'' was composed entirely by [[Shoji Meguro]], with the sole exception of "Adventured Act", which was composed by Yosuke Uda.&lt;ref name="semo-p3japan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/p/persona3.shtml |title=Persona 3 Original Soundtrack (Japan) |publisher=[[Square Enix]] Music Online |accessdate=August 15, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817103342/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/p/persona3.shtml |archivedate=August 17, 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as a two disc soundtrack in Japan by [[Aniplex]] on July 19, 2006. A selection of tracks from the full soundtrack was bundled with the North American release of the game.&lt;ref name="semo-p3us"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/p/persona3us.shtml |title=Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 Original Soundtrack (Japan) |publisher=[[Square Enix]] Music Online |accessdate=August 15, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817103508/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/p/persona3us.shtml |archivedate=August 17, 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An arranged album, titled ''Burn My Dread -Reincarnation: Persona 3-'', was also released in Japan by Aniplex on April 18, 2007. It contains eleven arrangements of tracks from ''Persona 3'', as well as an extended version of the song "Burn My Dread."&lt;ref name="semo-bmdr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/p/persona3arr.shtml |title=Burn My Dread -Reincarnation: Persona 3- |publisher=[[Square Enix]] Music Online |accessdate=August 15, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817103349/http://www.squareenixmusic.com/albums/p/persona3arr.shtml |archivedate=August 17, 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meguro stated that the development of ''Persona 3'' was one of his first opportunities to fully realize his music in video games. The soundtrack features a high use of vocals, though Meguro did not consider this as special or exceptional. A tune from previous ''Persona'' titles he rearranged was "Aria of the Soul", the theme of the Velvet Room. The game's battle theme, "Mass Destruction", was originally just a prototype, but the reception to it was so positive that it went into the final game.&lt;ref name="Persona3Liners"&gt;Meguro, Shoji.

The move to the [[PlayStation 2]] allowed for real-time [[Streaming media|streaming]] of music. Meguro considers this "the point at which [he] was finally able to express [his] music without making any compromises". He was also worried about the pronunciation of the English lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patterson, Eric L. |author2=Kohama, Dai |date=2008 |title=The horrors of reality TV...

''Persona 3'' received positive reviews upon its release, earning a Metacritic score of 86.&lt;ref name="Metacritic-original" /&gt; Shane Bettenhausen of [[1UP.com]] called the game a "refreshingly new take on the ''MegaTen'' [''Megami Tensei''] concept", and "the best RPG hitting the PS2 this year."  He praised the "excellent" AI created to direct the actions of party members during battle, which he felt created "the series' speediest and most dynamic battle system to date."&lt;ref name="1UP-Persona 3 Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/persona-3 |title=Persona 3 Review |last=Bettenhausen |first=Shane |accessdate=August 22, 2009 |date=August 14, 2007 |publisher=[[1UP.com]]. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018004841/http://www.1up.com/reviews/persona-3 |archivedate=October 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Haynes from [[IGN]] criticized the system, finding that it would occasionally result in the death of the player's character, which causes a [[game over]].&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 Review" /&gt;

GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.0, calling it "a rare supernatural delicacy" stating it is an RPG that fans of the genre shouldn't miss out on. [[GameSpy]]'s Patrick Joynt praised the social elements of ''Persona 3'', calling the game's Social Links "almost universally fascinating."  While he suspected the simulation elements would "probably be the biggest hurdle" for fans of role-playing or ''Megami Tensei'' games, in his review he wrote that he "can't stress enough how well-done it is."&lt;ref name="Gamespy-Persona 3 Review" /&gt;  Heidi Kemps of [[GamesRadar]] found the game's teenage themes to be "a refreshing change" from those of other games in the genre, as they touch on "the social awkwardness common at that point in life."&lt;ref name="GamesRadar-Persona 3 Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/ps2/review/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3/a-2007081511577988075/p-2 |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 |last=Kemps |first=Heidi |accessdate=August 22, 2009 |publisher=[[GamesRadar]]. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616051126/http://www.gamesradar.com/ps2/review/shin-megami-tensei-persona-3/a-2007081511577988075/p-2 |archivedate=June 16, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'''s Joe Juba found the game's environments to be weak, as "most of the game takes place within one tower [Tartarus]."  He also in his review noted that the game's roots in the ''Megami Tensei'' series would come across as foreign to new players.  "If you don't know anything about fusing Personas, or simply that 'bufu' means 'ice attack,' you have some catching up to do."&lt;ref name="GI-Persona 3 FES Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200708/R07.0724.1124.03675.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610133556/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200708/R07.0724.1124.03675.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2008 |title=Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 Special Edition review |first=Joe |last=Juba |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |publisher=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeff Haynes commented that the change "harkens back to a classic, more hardcore RPG experience of fighting and grinding", while done at the expense of what "made ''Persona 3'' so intriguing in the first place."&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 FES Review" /&gt;  The reviews of GameSpy and IGN reiterated issues found with the original game, such as the inability to directly control party members in battle.&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 FES Review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamespy-Persona 3 FES Review" /&gt;

Shane Bettenhausen considered the inclusion of Evokers "a ballsy and shocking move" on the part of Atlus, but felt their inclusion created "an edgy sensibility that fits perfectly with the overall dark tone" of the game.&lt;ref name="1UP-Persona 3 Review" /&gt;  Similarly, Joe Juba thought the concept fit "perfectly" with the game's "dark tone".&lt;ref name="GI-Persona 3 FES Review" /&gt;  Jeff Haynes found the animations of characters using their Evokers to be "intriguing and shocking at the same time".&lt;ref name="IGN-Persona 3 Review" /&gt;  While previewing ''Persona 3'' for GameSpot, Kevin VanOrd said that the continued use of Evokers "never gets old and it never gets any less awesome to watch, and considering that you could play this for fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty hours or more, that's saying something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Gallup, Rich; Gerstmann, Jeff; VanOrd, Kevin |title=On the Spot – 07/26/07 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/shows/on-the-spot/?series=on-the-spot&amp;event=on_the_spot20070726 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |time=39:50 |accessdate=November 12, 2009 |date=July 26, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106020921/http://www.gamespot.com/shows/on-the-spot/?series=on-the-spot&amp;event=on_the_spot20070726 |archivedate=November 6, 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atlus U.S.A. did not remove the Evokers from ''Persona 3'' for its worldwide release, despite the possible controversy.

===''Persona 3 FES''===
{{nihongo|''Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3 FES''|ペルソナ3フェス|Perusona Surī Fesu}} is an add-on disc for ''Persona 3'' containing updates to the original game, as well as a new [[epilogue]] in which the player controls [[List of Persona 3 characters#Aigis|Aigis]].  ''FES'' was released in Japan on April 19, 2007, as both a stand-alone game, and with the "director's cut" version of ''Persona 3''.  Overseas, the combined edition was published in North America by [[Atlus#Atlus USA|Atlus U.S.A.]] on April 22, 2008, and in Europe by [[Koei]] on October 17, 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  According to the game's director, Katsura Hashino, the subtitle "Fes" is derived from the word "festival".&lt;ref name="RPGFan Persona 3 FES"&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Winkler |title=Atlus Announces Persona 3 Director's Cut |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2006/1585.html |publisher=RPGFan |date=December 7, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024123226/http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2006/1585.html |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the game was re-released as a PS2 Classic on PSN for the [[PS3]] in 2012. Players of the original Persona 3 are given the option of transferring certain data from the original version's save file, such as the player's compendium, social-related stats, and maxed Social Link items.

The expansion to ''Persona 3'', in addition to adding new content to the main game (referred to as "The Journey", or "Episode Yourself" in the Japanese version), includes an epilogue to the original story titled "The Answer" ("Episode Aegis" in the Japanese version).  The core gameplay of The Answer is similar to that of The Journey, although the Social Link system has been removed, and the player does not attend school.&lt;ref name="Gamespot-Persona 3 FES Review" /&gt;

The announcement in ''[[Famitsū]]'' revealed that the player would have the option to play as a female character. This selection alters some aspects of the story: the first Persona gained by the Protagonist, Orpheus, has a different appearance; Igor's assistant in the Velvet Room, Elizabeth, can be replaced with a male equivalent named Theodore.&lt;ref name="Famitsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/1227161_1407.html | script-title = ja:『ペルソナ3ポータブル』謎の敵"シャドウ"に挑む特別課外活動部 |publisher=[[Famitsū]] |date=September 5, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |language=ja |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303214723/http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/1227161_1407.html |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gender choice also alters some aspects of the Social Link stories. In addition to the new playable character, there are two new [[difficulty level]]s to select from alongside the original game's three. ''Persona 3 Portable'' only includes the story of the original ''Persona 3'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlus.com/p3p/home.html Atlus.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123131338/http://www.atlus.com/p3p/home.html |date=January 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, general changes have been made to the plot, regardless of character choice.&lt;ref name="P3P-1UP" /&gt;

The game's revised battle system draws on elements added in ''Persona 3'''s successor, ''[[Persona 4]]''.  In combat, the player is able to directly control every character, as an alternative to utilizing the game's artificial intelligence.  The ability to guard has been added, and allies will take fatal attacks for the Protagonist, preventing his or her death.&lt;ref name="Famitsu" /&gt;  Outside of Tartarus, instead of navigating the game world by directly controlling the Protagonist, the player guides an on-screen cursor around an area, allowing interaction with characters and objects.  The game includes the voice acting of the original game, although characters are not shown in the world, instead being represented by on-screen portraits.  In addition, the anime [[cutscene]]s seen in the original ''Persona 3'' were replaced to feature in-game graphics.&lt;ref name="P3P-Upgrades"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Persona_3_Portable/index.html |title=RPGFan Reviews – Persona 3 Portable |publisher=RPGFan |date=December 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |author=James Quentin Clark |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708203135/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/Persona_3_Portable/index.html |archivedate=July 8, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shoji Meguro]] composed 10 new musical tracks for ''Persona 3 Portable''; with the majority of them being written for the female protagonist's playthrough.&lt;ref name="P3P-Upgrades" /&gt; Several [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] of characters from ''Persona 4'' have been added to ''Persona 3 Portable'', including [[List of Persona 4 characters#Yukiko Amagi|Yukiko Amagi]], a playable character from ''Persona 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/1228533_1407.html |script-title=ja:『ペルソナ3ポータブル』天城雪子が登場 |publisher=[[Famitsū]] |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |language=ja |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325064558/http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/1228533_1407.html |archivedate=March 25, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features a cameo from Vincent Brooks, the protagonist of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2010/08/18/catherines-connection-to-persona-3-portable/ |title=Catherine's Connection To Persona 3 Portable |publisher=Siliconera |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=December 15, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312103341/http://www.siliconera.com/2010/08/18/catherines-connection-to-persona-3-portable/ |archivedate=March 12, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''pH7CMS''' (formerly known as '''pH7 Social Dating CMS''') is an open source Social Dating software that allows creation of online communities and social dating services.

pH7CMS is written in PHP 5.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://ph7cms.com/doc/en/requirements |title=Requirements for the pH7 "Dating Community Social" software}}&lt;/ref&gt; is object-oriented and uses the [[Model–view–controller|MVC pattern]] (Model-View-Controller).

The software is based on the homemade ''pH7Framework'' and is designed with the [[KISS principle]] in mind. For better flexibility, the software uses [[PHP Data Objects|PDO]] (PHP Data Objects) abstraction which allows the choice of the database. The principle of development is [[Don't repeat yourself|DRY]] (Don't Repeat Yourself) aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds (not duplicate code).

It also wants to be fast, low-resource-intensive, extremely powerful and very secure.

pH7CMS is distributed in two distinct packages. One free with less features, no update/upgrade script and only for personal sites and another one sold for commercial sites, including premium features and update/upgrade scripts.

'''Rhetorical modes''' (also known as '''modes of discourse''') describe the variety, conventions, and purposes of the major kinds of [[language]]-based [[communication]], particularly [[writing]] and [[speaking]]. Four of the most common rhetorical modes and their purpose are [[Narrative mode|narration]], [[description]], [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]], and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]].{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}  The first codification of these rhetorical modes was by Samuel P. Newman in ''A Practical System of Rhetoric'' in 1827.{{sfn|Connors|1981|p=445}} 

==Narration==
{{further|Exposition (narrative)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of [[narrative mode|narration]] is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. Narration is an especially useful tool for sequencing or putting details and information into some kind of logical order, usually chronological. Working with narration helps us see clear sequences separate from all other mental functions. Examples include:
*[[Anecdote]]s
*[[Autobiography]]
*[[Biography]]
*[[Novel]]s
*[[Oral history]]
*[[Short story]]

==Description==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The  purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that which is being described. Descriptive writing can be found in the other rhetorical modes.  Examples include:
*[[Personal journal|Journal writing]]
*[[Poetry]]

==Exposition==
Expository writing is a type of [[writing]] where the purpose is to explain, inform, or even describe.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite web|last=Ball|first=Arnetha F.|title=Expository Writing|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~arnetha/expowrite/info.html|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of the four most common rhetorical modes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|title=Expository Writing|url=http://grammar.about.com/od/e/g/Expository-Writing-term.htm|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of expository writing is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. In [[narrative]] contexts (such as [[history]] and [[fiction]]), [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]] provides background information to teach or entertain. In other [[nonfiction]] contexts (such as [[technical communication]]), the purpose is to teach and inform. Examples include:{{sfn|Rozakis|2003|p=271}}
* Business
**[[Business letter]]s
**[[Report]]s
**[[News release|Press releases]]
* Journalism
**[[How-to|How-to essays, such as recipes and other instructions]]
**[[Article (publishing)|News article]]
* Personal
**[[Personal letter]]s
**[[Will (law)|Wills]]
* Academic and [[technical communication]]
**[[Scientific writing]]
***[[Scientific report]]s
***[[Scientific journal]] articles
**[[Academic writing]]
***[[Term paper]]s
***[[Textbook]]s
***General [[reference work]]s
****[[Encyclopedia|Encyclopedia articles]]
**[[Technical writing]]
***[[User guide]]s
***[[Technical standard]]s

==Argumentation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
The purpose of argumentation (also called ''[[persuasive writing]]'') is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument to thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing/Persuasion is a type of argumentation with the additional aim to urge the reader to take some form of action.  Examples include:
*[[Copywriting|Advertising copy]]
*[[review|Critical review]]
*[[Editorial]]s
*[[Job evaluation]]
*[[Job application]] letter
*[[Letter of recommendation]]
*[[Letter to the editor|Letters to the editor]]
*[[Résumé]]s

Another form of persuasive rhetoric is satirical rhetoric, or using humor in order to make a point about some aspect of life or society. Perhaps the most famous example is [[Jonathan Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]".

==Fiction-writing modes==
Each [[fiction-writing mode]] has its own purposes and conventions. Agent and author Evan Marshall identifies five fiction-writing modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt| Marshall | 1998 | pp = 143–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and writing-instructor [[Jessica Page Morrell]] lists six delivery modes for fiction-writing: action, exposition, description, dialogue, summary, and transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Morrell | 2006 | p = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Peter Selgin]] refers to ''methods'', including action, dialogue, thoughts, summary, scene, and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt | Selgin | 2007 | p = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{merge from|The Haunter of the Dark#Robert Blake|date=October 2017}}
[[File:The Haunter of the Dark by Jarkko Naas.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Robert Blake]]
'''Robert Harrison Blake''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. The character is the creation of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and appears in his [[short story]] "[[The Haunter of the Dark]]" ([[1935 in literature|1935]]).

==Summary==
In Lovecraft's tale, Robert Blake is a young author and painter from [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. He comes to [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and moves into an apartment on College Street. While there, he completes five short stories: "The Burrower Beneath", "The Feaster from the Stars", "In the Vale of Pnath", "Shaggai", and "The Stairs in the Crypt". He becomes obsessed with a deserted church on Federal Hill that he can see from his window. He later learns of a cult that was once active there, the [[Cthulhu Mythos cults#Church of Starry Wisdom|Church of Starry Wisdom]]. His investigation of this cult inevitably leads to his death.

==Origin==
Lovecraft based Robert Blake on one of his correspondents, the teenage [[Robert Bloch]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bloch (1917&amp;ndash;1994) is best known as the author of the novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'', on which the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film is based.&lt;/ref&gt; who had just begun his career as a writer of [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[science fiction]]. In the story, Lovecraft even had Blake residing at Bloch's real-life address at the time: 620 E. Knapp Street, [[Milwaukee]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearsall, "Blake, Robert Harrison", ''The Lovecraft Lexicon'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the Blake character has a notable backstory. The character first appeared as the unnamed narrator of Bloch's "The Shambler from the Stars" ([[1935 in literature|1935]]). Before he wrote the tale, Bloch thought it would be amusing to kill off a character based on Lovecraft. Lovecraft consented to the idea and gave his permission in the form of a satirical letter, signed by Lovecraft himself and "attested" by several of his creations: [[Abdul Alhazred]], [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Du Nord, Gespard|Gespard du Nord]], [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Von Junzt, Friedrich Wilheim|Frederich von Juntz]], and the "Tcho-Tcho Lama of Leng" (possibly referring to the [[High Priest Not to Be Described]]). The body of the letter appears as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is to certify that Robert Bloch, Esq., of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A.&amp;mdash;reincarnation of Meinheer [[Cthulhu Mythos biographies#Prinn, Ludwig|Ludvig Prinn]], author of [[De Vermis Mysteriis]]&amp;mdash;is fully authorised to portray, murder, annihilate, disintegrate, transfigure, metamorphose, or otherwise manhandle the undersigned in the tale entitled ''The Shambler from the Stars''.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, ''Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos'', pp. 116&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Bloch's story, the Lovecraft-based character becomes the ill-fated victim of an [[star vampire|invisible, vampiric monster]] summoned from the depths of outer space. Lovecraft was delighted by the story and returned the favor by killing off Robert Bloch, a.k.a. Robert Blake, in "The Haunter of the Dark".&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Bloch wrote a sequel to "The Haunter of the Dark" entitled "The Shadow from the Steeple" ([[1950 in literature|1950]]) in which Robert Blake's death is investigated by his friend Edmund Fiske.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert M. Price]] believes that Robert Blake is not merely a counterpart to Robert Bloch, but is actually a combination of three different people: Bloch, Lovecraft himself, and [[Clark Ashton Smith]]. As one example, Price notes that the dwelling that Blake occupies in Providence parallels Lovecraft's own apartment. Furthermore, Blake, like Smith, is a skilled painter and produces bizarre "studies of nameless, unhuman monsters, and profoundly alien, non-terrestrial landscapes."&lt;ref&gt;Lovecraft, "[[The Haunter of the Dark]]", ''The Dunwich Horror and Others'', p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovecraft sometimes mentioned Smith's art in his own stories whenever he wanted to feature a weird setting or the reproduction of one. In "The Haunter of the Dark", however, Price believes that Lovecraft took the notion one step further and depicted Smith himself as one of the three aspects of Robert Blake.&lt;ref&gt;Price, "The Works of Robert Blake", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #80'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short story titles==
Other Mythos authors have attempted to supply text for Blake's fictional titles, perhaps writing them as Blake himself might have. Robert M. Price argues that at least three of these titles have already been written. First, "The Feaster from the Stars" is obviously a parallel to Bloch's "The Shambler from the Stars" (a title Lovecraft suggested to Bloch). Second, "The Stairs in the Crypt" appears to be a cross between two of Bloch's short stories: "The Grinning Ghoul" and "The Secret in the Crypt". Lastly, "The Burrower Beneath" is similar to "The Blasphemy Beneath", an early story that Bloch sent to Lovecraft for review.&lt;ref&gt;Price, "About 'The Burrower Beneath'", ''The Book of Eibon'', p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Price believes that Blake's "In the Vale of Pnath" is another name for Lovecraft's &lt;!--NOTE, THIS IS A NOVELLA, HENCE ITALICS--&gt;''[[The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath]]'' ([[1926 in literature|1926]]), since in the story [[Randolph Carter]] is carried to the [[Underworld (Dreamlands)|Underworld]] and soon realizes that he is "in the vale of Pnath".

"Shaggai" may parallel Lovecraft's "The Whisperer in Darkness" ([[1931 in literature|1931]]). Since in "The Haunter of the Dark" Lovecraft says that [[Cthulhu Mythos celestial bodies#Shaggai|Shaggai]]&lt;ref&gt;For [[Ramsey Campbell]]'s take on Shaggai, see [[Insect from Shaggai]].&lt;/ref&gt; lies beyond Yuggoth, he is adding yet another planet to the [[solar system]], essentially a new version of Yuggoth. Since Lovecraft often repackaged his Mythos creations in the revision stories he wrote for other authors, Price believes that "Shaggai" is the kind of story that Lovecraft would have ghostwritten if "Robert Blake" had been his client.&lt;ref&gt;Price, "The Works of Robert Blake", p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual misconduct''' is an [[umbrella term]] for any [[misconduct]] of a sexual nature that is of lesser offense than felony [[sexual assault]] (such as [[rape]] and [[child molestation|molestation]]), particularly where the situation is normally non-sexual and therefore unusual for sexual behavior, or where there is some aspect of personal power or authority that makes sexual behavior inappropriate. A common theme, and the reason for the term ''misconduct'', is that these violations occur during work or in a situation of a power imbalance. It is a legal concept to frame offenses which are non-criminal but nevertheless violating of another person's personal boundary in the area of sexuality and intimate personal relationships. 

Sexual misconduct is often perpetrated against an individual without their consent or where the power dynamics of the relationship are being challenged in an effort to redefine the nature or form of consent necessary in a given circumstance. The alleged misconduct can be of various degrees, such as exposure, assault, aggressive come-ons, pleading, or even inattentiveness to nonverbal cues of discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Ethical and Legal Terms and Issues'', by Len Sperry, 2007 – Routledge, pages 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt; The "definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear"  and it is a "lay term, sometimes used in institutional policies or by professional bodies", to deal with cases marked by power imbalance, coercion, and predatory behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly?

==Definitions==
In legal sense, for a person in a position of authority it includes in particular any [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] between them and one of their subordinates. This commonly includes teachers and their students, [[clergy]] and their congregants, doctors and their patients, and employers and their employees. While such activity is usually not explicitly illegal, it is often against professional [[ethical code]]s. For example, a teacher may be fired and a doctor may have their medical license revoked because of sexual misconduct. In addition, the person in the subordinate position may allege [[sexual harassment]]. The University of Iowa defines sexual misconduct as "...unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that is committed without consent or by force, intimidation, coercion, or manipulation." &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/students/sexual-misconduct-datingdomestic-violence-or-stalking-involving-students/definitions-and-1 |title=Operations Manual |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=opsmanual.uiowa.edu |publisher= University of Iowa|access-date=9 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entering a sexual relationship with a subordinate, even when the contact is initiated by the latter, is considered unethical by some because of the subordinate's vulnerability to the superior and the inequality of power that characterizes the relationship. In the case of the [[doctor-patient relationship]], having a sexual relationship with the patient even after the professional relationship has concluded is considered problematic for the physician because of the potential for the patient's continuing dependence on and [[transference]] towards the physician. Therefore, sexual relationships with former patients are considered unethical by the medical profession when physicians “use or exploit the [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[knowledge]], [[emotion]]s or influence derived from the previous professional relationship” in any way.{{sfn|JAMA|1991}} By contrast, legal ethics permit sexual relations with former client and, in California, with current clients as well so long as the sex is consensual and is not rendered in exchange for legal services. 

Some activities which are not strictly erotic, e.g. [[mooning]] (exposing the buttocks), [[streaking]] (running naked through a public area) and [[skinny dipping]] (swimming naked), are sometimes also categorized as sexual misconduct. Despite these opinions, others believe that sexual relations in workplace settings is not unethical including between boss and employee.{{fact|date=June 2018}} Many companies do not prohibit so-called fraternization but instead recognize the difference between consensual dating and improper behavior.

According to Joanne Laucius from the ''Ottawa Citizen'', the "definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear" and the "word ‘misconduct’ also lacks precision — it can be used as a catch-all for all kinds of behaviour, often obscuring what actually happened". Laucius states that the terms "sexual violence or sexual harassment and assault are much more specific terms that convey the nature of the allegations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly?

It covers an array of problematic sexual behaviour including sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual abuse. Two of these terms have specific (and different) legal meanings: Sexual assault has a specific meaning in the criminal law context, unlike sexual misconduct, which may cover both criminal and non-criminal conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly?

Elizabeth Sheehy, the Shirley Greenberg Chair for Women and the Legal Profession at the University of Ottawa, states that "[s]exual misconduct is a social issue and not a fixed line — it shifts as women gain access to economic and political equality. It’s not found under criminal law, in human rights codes, or collective agreements. It might be found under professional disciplinary codes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly?

First, a power imbalance. Second, coercion, whether implicit or explicit. Third, predatory behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly?

It could be any number of things — someone is made to feel uncomfortable, or they feel they are being watched or looked at in a certain way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/what-is-sexual-misconduct-exactly-depends-on-who-you-ask |title=What is sexual misconduct, exactly?

Michelle Cottle wrote in ''The Atlantic'' that the "...almost infinite shades of creepy misbehavior on display are challenging the legal and cultural categories used to describe them", as this issue is, in "...some ways, uncharted territory", making it "...hard to tell how the new lines will be drawn, much less where."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/what-does-sexual-misconduct-actually-mean/548807/ |title=What Does 'Sexual Misconduct' Actually Mean?

==Among educators==
[[File:Suzuki Harunobu - Sexual Misconduct, From the book Fashionable, Lusty Mane’emon 1770.jpg|thumb|[[Suzuki Harunobu]] - "Sexual Misconduct", from the book ''Fashionable, Lusty Mane’emon'', 1770]]

A literature review of educator sexual misconduct published by the US Department of Education found that 9.6% of high school students have experienced some form of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/research/pubs/misconductreview/report.pdf, the actual 9.6% figure was for 8th-11th grades. Author Charol Shakeshaft extrapolated it to K-12th, which is questionable.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 4% to 43% of cases, the abusers were women. Black, Hispanic, and Native American Indian children are at greatest risk for [[sexual abuse]]. Also at increased risk are children with disabilities; the reason for this may be their greater need for individual attention and their possible problems with communicating.{{sfn|West|Hatters-Friedman|Knoll|2010|pp=9–10}}

Children who have been victims of educator sexual misconduct usually have low [[self-esteem]], and they are likely to develop suicidal ideation and depression. Because the abuser was a person the child was encouraged to trust, they may experience a sense of betrayal.{{sfn|West|Hatters-Friedman|Knoll|2010|pp=9–10}}

The '''Solomon curve''' is a [[graphical representation]] of the collision rate of automobiles as a function of their speed compared to the average vehicle speed on the same road. The curve was based on [[research]] conducted by David Solomon in the late 1950s and published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Solomon | title=Accidents on main rural highways related to speed, driver, and vehicle | date=July 1964, Reprinted 1974 | publisher=Technical report, U.S. Department of Commerce/Bureau of Public Roads (precursor to Federal Highway Administration)| work = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research suggests significant biases in the Solomon study, which may cast doubt on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Travelling Speed and the Risk of Crash Involvement on Rural Roads | date=July 2001 | publisher=Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University | url=http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/ruralspeed/RURALSPEED.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original research ==
In 1964, Solomon researched the relationship between [[average]] [[speed]] and the [[collision]] [[Rate (mathematics)|rates]] of [[automobile]]s and plotted the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Meyer | first = John Robert | authorlink = |author2=José A.

== Subsequent research ==
In 1968, Julie Cirillo conducted a similar study of 2,000 vehicles on interstate highways that addressed speed variation’s impact on crashes that involved two or more vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cirillo |first=J. A.|title = Interstate System Accident Research Study II, Interim Report II, Public Roads, 35 (3) |year = 1968|pages = 71–75 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cirillo data produced a U-shaped curve similar to the Solomon curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cost-Benefit Evaluation of Large Truck- Automobile Speed Limit Differentials on Rural Interstate Highways|journal=University of Arkansas, Department of Industrial Engineering|date=November 2005|first=Steven L.|last=Johnson|author2=Naveen Pawar|volume=|issue=|pages=Page 25|id=|url=http://ww2.mackblackwell.org/web/research/ALL_RESEARCH_PROJECTS/2000s/2048/Final%20MBTC%20Report%202048%2011-8.doc|format=MS Word|accessdate=2009-03-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727051900/http://ww2.mackblackwell.org/web/research/ALL_RESEARCH_PROJECTS/2000s/2048/Final%20MBTC%20Report%202048%2011-8.doc|archivedate=2011-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Research Triangle Institute]] conducted a study in 1970 where data was collected on 114 crashes involving 216 vehicles on a state highway in Indiana to address these concerns by (1) combining automated, embedded speed-monitoring stations with trained on-scene crash investigators, and (2) distinguishing data on vehicles slowing to negotiate a turn from vehicles moving slowly in the flow of traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Research Triangle Institute, "Speed and Accident, Volume II," Report No. FH-11-6965, National Highway Safety Bureau, June 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on these results in 1971, academics West and Dunn confirmed the findings of Solomon and Cirillo,&lt;ref name="Impacts and Issues Related to Proposed Changes in Oregon’s Interstate Speed Limits"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.its.pdx.edu/speedlimits/final%20interstate%20speed%20review%20report%20(9.12).pdf | title=Impacts and Issues Related to Proposed Changes in Oregon’s Interstate Speed Limits | accessdate=3-1-2009 | author=Monsere, C.

B., Jr. and Dunn, J. W. (1971). "Accidents, Speed Deviation and Speed Limits." Traffic Engineering. 41 (10), 52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Fildes, Rumbold, and Leening collected self-reported crash data from 707 motorists in Australia with fewer than 200 reporting that they had been in a collision but, unlike Solomon and Cirillo, the researchers found no relationship between slower speeds and increased crash involvement.&lt;ref name="Speed Behaviour and Drivers’ Attitude to Speeding"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.monash.edu.au/muarc/reports/muarc016.html | title=Speed Behaviour and Drivers’ Attitude to Speeding | accessdate=3-2-2009 |vauthors=Fildes BN, Rumbold G, Leening A | date=June 1991 | location = Monash University Accident Research Centre, Victoria Australia, | quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding the many studies over the years, in testimony before the Ohio Senate Highways and Transportation Committee on June 10, 2003, Julie Cirillo, Former Assistant Administrator and Chief Safety Officer for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ([[FMCSA]]), testified that "up to the present time there has been no evidence to alter Solomon’s original finding that variance from the mean operating speed is a major contributor to accidents".&lt;ref name="Testimonyof2003"&gt;{{cite news|title=Testimony of Julie Anna Cirillo |date=2003-06-10 |publisher=OOIDA |url=http://www.landlinemag.com/Special_Reports/2003/June03/Cirillo_Testimony.htm |work=Land Line Magazine |pages= |accessdate=2009-03-02 |language= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040816035301/http://www.landlinemag.com/Special_Reports/2003/June03/Cirillo_Testimony.htm |archivedate=August 16, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2001, Kloeden CN, Ponte G and McLean AJ of the Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University quantified the relationship, "... between free travelling speed and the risk of involvement in a casualty crash in 80 km/h or greater speed limit zones in rural South Australia" using a case control study design. They found, "..the risk of involvement in a casualty crash increased more than exponentially with increasing free travelling speed above the mean traffic speed and that travelling speeds below the mean traffic speed were associated with a lower risk of being involved in a casualty crash." Outlining past research in this area, they suggest that, in the Solomon research, "Both the numerator (number of crashes in a particular speed band) and the denominator (number of vehicle-miles travelled in that same speed band) may have been quite inaccurate for relatively low speeds." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Travelling Speed and the Risk of Crash Involvement on Rural Roads | date=July 2001 | publisher=Road Accident Research Unit, Adelaide University | url=http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/ruralspeed/RURALSPEED.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical foundation ==
Hauer provided a theoretical foundation for the Solomon curve in 1971—“for example, if I drive at 45 mph, while the [[median]] of the pack is 60 mph, how many cars will pass me in an hour and hence have a chance to collide with me?”—that showed that the theoretical [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] was nearly identical to the Solomon curve.&lt;ref name="Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFhkehz-Ky0C&amp;pg=PA276&amp;lpg=PA276&amp;dq=%22The+Solomon+Curve%22 | title=Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy | accessdate=3-1-2009 |author1=John Robert Meyer |author2=José A. Gómez-Ibáñez |author3=William B. Tye |author4=Clifford Winston | pages=Page 276 | isbn=978-0-8157-3181-8 | date=1999-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical implications ==
While Solomon’s research focused on speed deviation, and not speed per se, some commentators have cited Solomon’s research to support the conclusion that raw speed and crash risk are not directly related.&lt;ref name="Is speed killing us?"/&gt; On the other hand, while recognizing Solomon's research reveals the importance to safety of variability around average speed, Leonard Evans concludes in ''[[Traffic Safety and the Driver]]'' that control of absolute driver speed, and not variability, should be the primary focus of traffic safety regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Leonard| title = Traffic Safety and the Driver | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | year = 1991 | location = New York, New York | pages = 155–56 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=OyuGJJ6rKQ0C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=%22Traffic+Safety+and+the+Driver%22+Solomon| isbn = 0-442-00163-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both views support the fact that the seminal research underlying the Solomon curve shows that the greater the difference between a driver’s speed and the average speed of traffic—both above and below that average speed—the greater the likelihood of involvement in a crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Transportation Research Board | first = Committee for Guidance on Setting and Enforcing Speed Limits | title = Managing Speed | publisher = National Research Council (U.S.) | year = 1998 | location = | pages = 46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pARs53U6NAQC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=%22drive+with+the+flow+of+traffic”+Solomon | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-309-06502-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many states and safety organizations advise drivers to “drive with the flow of traffic”.&lt;ref name="Testimonyof2003" /&gt;

[[File:Summer dress (5634765615).jpg|thumb|Model wearing a sundress at a fashion show.]]

A '''sundress''' is a [[dress]] intended to be worn in warm weather. Typically, it is an informal or casual dress in a lightweight [[fabric]], most commonly [[cotton]], and usually loose-fitting. It is a sleeveless dress, typically with a wide neckline and thin shoulder straps. A sundress is typically worn without a layering top and is not typically worn over a blouse, sweater or t-shirt. 

The sundress was popularized by [[Lilly Pulitzer]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Chattanooga: Light clothes still heavy on style |author=  Karen Nazor Hill|url= http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jun/20/chattanooga-light-clothes-still-heavy-style/|newspaper= Chattanooga Times Free Press |date= 20 June 2008|accessdate=25 June 2012|archive-url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2008/jun/20/chattanooga-light-clothes-still-heavy-style/||archive-date=2018-09-02|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Coming Race''''' is a novel by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], published anonymously in 1871. It has also been published as '''''Vril, the Power of the Coming Race'''''.
 
Some readers have believed the account of a superior subterranean [[master race]] and the energy-form called "Vril", at least in part; some [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]], notably [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[William Scott-Elliot]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]], accepted the book as based on occult truth, in part.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–123.&lt;/ref&gt; One 1960 book, ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', suggested that a [[Secret society|secret]] '''Vril Society''' existed in [[Weimar_Republic|Weimar]] [[Berlin]]. However, there is no evidence for the existence of such a society.

==History==
The original, British edition of ''The Coming Race'' was published anonymously in May 1871, by Blackwood and Sons of Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref name=newsUK/&gt; (Blackwood published four more "editions" in 1871.)&lt;ref name="editions"/&gt; Anonymous American and Canadian editions were published in August, as ''The Coming Race, or The New Utopia'', by Francis B. Felt &amp; Co. in New York and by Copp, Clark &amp; Co. in Toronto.&lt;ref name=newsUS/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsCA/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Late in 1871 Bulwer-Lytton was known to be the author.{{cn|date=December 2017}} [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' was also published anonymously, in March 1872, and Butler suspected that its initial success was due to being taken as a ''Coming Race'' sequel by Bulwer-Lytton. It was revealed that Butler was the writer in the 25 May 1872 issue of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''; as Butler was unknown at the time, sales dropped by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Redfield | first = Marc | title = Phantom Formations: Aesthetic Ideology and the Bildungsroman | publisher = Cornell University Press | date = 1996 | page = 170 | isbn = 0-8014-3236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel centres on a young, independent, unnamed, wealthy traveller (the narrator), who visits a friend,  a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city  that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host's wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift [[dictionary]] during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language. His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who they are and how they function.

The hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to [[Telepathy|transmit information]], [[Analgesic|get rid of pain]], and [[Hypnosis|put others to sleep.]] The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.

The narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an [[antediluvian]] civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they had fled underground thousands of years ago to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended housed 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society was a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an "all-permeating fluid" called "Vril", a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depended on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gave them access to an extraordinary force that could be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employed to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril included the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular were powerful, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.

Men (called An, pronounced "Arn") and women (called Gy, pronounced "Gee") have equal rights. The women are stronger and larger than the men. The women are also the pursuing party of romantic relationships. They marry for just three years, after which the men choose whether to remain married, or be single. The female may then pursue a new husband. However, they seldom make the choice to remarry.

Their religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form.

The narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. Zee falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Taee to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taee and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bulwer Lytton|first1=Edward|title=Vril: The Power of the Coming Race|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Vril:_The_Power_of_the_Coming_Race;_The_New_Utopia|website=wikisource.com|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vril in the novel===

The uses of Vril in the novel amongst the Vril-ya vary from destruction to healing. According to Zee, the daughter of the narrator's host, Vril can be changed into the mightiest agency over all types of matter, both animate and inanimate. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration.

A Vril staff is an object in the shape of a wand or a staff which is used as a channel for Vril. The narrator describes it as hollow with "stops", "keys", or "springs" in which Vril can be altered, modified, or directed to either destroy or heal. The staff is about the size of a walking stick but can be lengthened or shortened according to the user's preferences. The appearance and function of the Vril staff differs according to gender, age, etc. Some staves are more potent for destruction; others, for healing. The staves of children are said to be much simpler than those of sages; in those of wives and mothers, the destructive part is removed while the healing aspects are emphasised.

==Literary significance and reception==

The book was quite popular in the late 19th century, and for a time the word "Vril" came to be associated with "life-giving elixirs".&lt;ref name = "dav"&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Seed | origyear = 1870 | title = The Coming Race | first2 = Sir Edward | last2 = Bulwer‐Lytton | publisher = Wesleyan University Press | date = 2007 | pages = xvii, 159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known use of "Vril" in this context is in the name of [[Bovril]] (a [[blend word]] of Bovine and Vril).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Hadley | title = A History of Bovril Advertising | place = London | publisher = Bovril | date = 1972 | page = 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 5 to 7 March 1891, there was even a "Vril-ya Bazaar" held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has shown that Bulwer-Lytton developed his ideas about "Vril" against the background of his long preoccupation with occult natural forces, which were widely discussed at that time, especially in relation to [[animal magnetism]] or, later, [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 13–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In his earlier novels ''[[Zanoni]]'' (1842) and ''A Strange Story'' (1862), Bulwer-Lytton had discussed electricity and other "material agents" as the possible natural causes for occult phenomena. In ''The Coming Race'', those ideas are continued in the context of a satirical critique of contemporary philosophical, scientific, and political currents. In a letter to his friend John Forster, Bulwer-Lytton explained his motives:

{{bq|1=I did not mean Vril for mesmerism, but for electricity, developed into uses as yet only dimly guessed, and including whatever there may be genuine in mesmerism, which I hold to be a mere branch current of the one great fluid pervading all nature. I am by no means, however, wedded to Vril, if you can suggest anything else to carry out this meaning namely, that the coming race, though akin to us, has nevertheless acquired by hereditary transmission, etc., certain distinctions which make it a different species, and contains powers which we could not attain to through a slow growth of time; so that this race would not amalgamate with, but destroy us. [...]

Now, as some bodies are charged with electricity like the torpedo or electric eel, and never can communicate that power to other bodies, so I suppose the existence of a race charged with that electricity and having acquired the art to concentre and direct it in a word, to be conductors of its lightnings. If you can suggest any other idea of carrying out that idea of a destroying race, I should be glad. Probably even the notion of Vril might be more cleared from mysticism or mesmerism by being simply defined to be electricity and conducted by those staves or rods, omitting all about mesmeric passes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Victor Alexander Robert | last = Lytton | title = The Life of Edward Bulwer Lytton, First Lord Lytton, vol. 1 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofedwardbulw00lyttuoft| place = London | publisher = Macmillan and Co. | date = 1913 | page = 466f.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bulwer-Lytton has been regarded as an "initiate" or "adept" by esotericists, especially because of his [[Rosicrucian]] novel ''Zanoni'' (1842). However, there is no historical evidence that suggests that Bulwer-Lytton can be seen as an occultist, or that he has been the member of any kind of esoteric association. Instead, it has been shown that Bulwer-Lytton has been "esotericized" since the 1870s. In 1870, the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] appointed Bulwer-Lytton as her "Grand Patron." Although Bulwer-Lytton complained about this by letter in 1872, the claim has never been revoked. Other claims, such as his membership in a German [[masonic]] lodge ''Zur aufgehenden Morgenröthe'', have been proven wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those claims, as well as the recurrent esoteric topics in Bulwer-Lytton's works, convinced some commentators that the fictionalised Vril was based on a real magical force. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], endorsed this view in her book ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877) and again in ''The Secret Doctrine'' (1888). In Blavatsky, the Vril power and its attainment by a superhuman elite are worked into a mystical doctrine of race. However, the character of the subterranean people was transformed. Instead of potential conquerors, they were benevolent (if mysterious) spiritual guides. Blavatsky's recurrent homage to Bulwer-Lytton and the Vril force has exerted a lasting influence on other esoteric authors.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 69ff., 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[William Scott-Elliot]] describes life in [[Atlantis]] in {{Citation | title = The Story of Atlantis &amp; The Lost Lemuria | edition = first | date = 1896}}, the aircraft of the Atlanteans are propelled by Vril-force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L Sprague | last = de Camp | title = [[Lost Continents]] | date = 1954 | edition = first | page = 67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His books are still published by the [[Theosophical Society]]. Scott-Elliot's description of Atlantean aircraft has been identified as an early inspiration for authors who have related the Vril force to [[UFO]]s after World War II.

[[George Bernard Shaw]] read the book and was attracted to the idea of Vril, according to [[Michael Holroyd]]'s biography of him.

French writer [[Jules Lermina]] included a Vril-powered flying machine in his {{Citation | language = French | date = 1910 | type = novel | title = L'Effrayante Aventure | trans-title = Panic in Paris}}.

==Stage adaptation==

A stage adaptation of the book was written by journalist [[David Christie Murray]] and magician [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]]. The production premiered at [[St. George's Hall, London|Saint George's Hall]] in London on 2 January 1905. Both Nevil Maskelyne and his father [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] collaborated on the special effects for the play. The play did not meet with success and closed after a run of eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jim | last = Steinmeyer | author-link = Jim Steinmeyer | title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible and Learned to Disappear | publisher = Carrol &amp; Graf | type = trade paperback | date = 2004 | pages = 184–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vril Society==

===Willy Ley===
[[Image:Heinz Haber Wernher von Braun Willy Ley (1954).jpg|thumb|190px|[[Willy Ley]] (right) in a discussion with [[Heinz Haber]] and [[Wernher von Braun|Wernher v. Braun]], 1954]]
[[Willy Ley]] was a German rocket engineer who had emigrated to the United States in 1937.&lt;!-- or 1933 or 1935; 1937 says the German wiki-article on him--&gt; In 1947, he published an article titled "Pseudoscience in Naziland" in the magazine ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Willy | last = Ley |date=May 1947 | title = Pseudoscience in Naziland | journal = Astounding Science Fiction | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 90–98 | url = http://www.alpenfestung.com/ley_pseudoscience.htm | publisher = Alpenfestung}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the high popularity of irrational convictions in Germany at that time explained how National Socialism could have fallen on such fertile ground. Among various pseudoscientific groups he mentions one that looked for the Vril: 
"The next group was literally founded upon a novel. That group which I think called itself 'Wahrheitsgesellschaft'&amp;nbsp;— Society for Truth&amp;nbsp;—and which was more or less localised in Berlin, devoted its spare time looking for Vril."

===Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels===
The existence of a Vril Society was alleged in 1960 by [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In their book ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi [[Berlin]] that was a sort of inner circle of the [[Thule Society]]. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Monsieur Gurdjieff'', Louis Pauwels&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Amazon | title = Monsieur Gurdjieff | first = Louis | last = Pauwels | language = French | place = [[France|FR]]| id =  {{ASIN|2226081968|country=fr}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that a Vril Society had been founded by General [[Karl Haushofer]], a student of [[Russia]]n magician and metaphysician [[George Gurdjieff|Georges Gurdjieff]].

===Publications on the Vril Society in German===
The book of [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]] was published in [[German language|German]] with the title: ''Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft'' (literally ''Departure into the Third Millennium: The Future of the Fantastic Reason'') in 1969.

In his book [[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|''Black Sun'']], [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] refers to the research of the German author Peter Bahn. Bahn writes in his 1996 essay, "Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie" ("The Secret of Vril Energy"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Peter |last= Bahn |title= Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie: Berichte und Erfahrungen zu einer mächtigen Naturkraft |editor1-first= Adolf | editor1-last = Schneider |editor2-first= Inge |editor2-last= Schneider |work= Vorträge des Kongresses 1995 im Gwatt-Zentrum am Thunersee &lt;!-- Duplicate parameter --&gt;|place= Bern |publisher= Jupiter-Verlag A.+l. Schneider |date= 1996 |isbn= 3-906571-14-9 |pages= 137–46 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of his discovery of an obscure esoteric group calling itself the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft", which revealed itself in a rare 1930 publication ''Vril. Die Kosmische Urkraft'' (Vril, the cosmic elementary power) written by a member of this Berlin-based group, under the pseudonym "Johannes Täufer" (German: "John [the] Baptist"). Published by the influential astrological publisher, Otto Wilhelm Barth (whom Bahn believes was "Täufer"), the 60-page pamphlet says little of the group other than that it was founded in 1925 to study the uses of Vril energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Johannes | last = Täufer | contribution = "Vril" Die Kosmische Urkraft Wiedergeburt von Atlantis | language = German | title = Herausgegeben im Auftrage der Reichsarbeitgemeinschaft "Das kommende Deutschland" Zentralbüro | place = Berlin W 57, Pallasstr. 7 | publisher = Astrologischer Verlag Wilhelm Becker: Berlin Steglitz, Schloßstraße 69 | date = 1930}}. [[:de:Datei:Vril Urkraft Einband.jpg|See image in German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German historian Julian Strube has argued that the historical existence of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft" can be regarded as irrelevant to the post-war invention of the Vril Society, as Pauwels and Bergier have developed their ideas without any knowledge of that actual association.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Strube has also shown that the Vril force has been irrelevant to the other members of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft," who were supporters of the theories of the Austrian inventor Karl Schappeller (1875–1947).&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 98–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric neo-Nazism===
After World War II, a group referred to by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke as the [[Landig Group|Vienna Circle]] elaborated an esoteric neo-Nazism that contributed to the circulation of the Vril topos in a new context.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In their writings, Vril is associated with [[Nazi UFOs]] and the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] concept. Julian Strube wrote that a younger generation related to the [[Neo-völkisch movements#Tempelhofgesellschaft|Tempelhofgesellschaft]], has continued the work of the Vienna Circle and exerts a continuous influence on the most common notions of Vril. Those notions are not only popular in neo-Nazi circles but also in movies or computer games, such as ''[[Iron Sky]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''weight machine''' is an [[exercise machine]] used for [[weight training]] that uses gravity as the primary source of resistance and a combination of [[simple machine]]s to convey that resistance to the person using the machine. Each of the simple machines (pulley, lever, wheel, incline) changes the [[mechanical advantage]] of the overall machine relative to the weight.

==Stack machines==
{{see also|Cable machine}}
[[Image:WeightStack.JPG|thumb|175px|The weight stack from a [[cable machine]]: each plate weighs 6&amp;nbsp;[[kg]].]]
A ''stack machine''&amp;mdash;also called a ''stack'' or ''rack''&amp;mdash;has a set of rectangular plates that are pierced by a vertical bar which has holes drilled in it to accept a pin.  Each of the plates has a channel on its underside (or a hole through the middle, as visible in the picture) that aligns with one of the holes.  When the pin is inserted through the channel into the hole, all of the plates above the pin rest upon it, and are lifted when the bar rises.  The plates below do not rise.  This allows the same machine to provide several levels of resistance over the same range of motion with an adjustment that requires very little force to accomplish in itself.

The means of lifting the bar varies.  Some machines have a roller at the top of the bar that sits on a lever.  When the lever is raised the bar can go up and the roller moves along the lever, allowing the bar to stay vertical.  On some machines the bar is attached to a hinge on the lever, which causes swaying in the bar and the plates as the lever goes up and down.  On other machines the bar is attached to a cable or belt, which runs through pulleys or over a wheel.  The other end of the cable will either be a handle or strap that the user holds or wraps around some body part, or will be attached to a lever, adding further simple machines to the mechanical chain.

Usually, each plate is marked with a number.  On some machines these numbers give the actual weight of the plate and those above it.  On some, the number gives the force at the user's actuation point with the machine.  And on some machines the number is simply an index counting the number of plates being lifted.

The early [[Nautilus, Inc.|Nautilus]] machines were a combination of lever and cable machines.  They also had optional, fixed elements such as a chinning bar.  [[Universal Gym Equipment]] pioneered the multi-station style of machines.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/24/local/me-zinkin24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plate-loaded machines==
''Plate-loaded machines'' (such as the [[Smith machine]] or sled-type [[leg press]]) use standard [[barbell plate]]s instead of captive stacks of plates.  They combine a bar-end on which to hang the plates with a number of simple machines to convey the force to the user.

The plate-loaded machines will often have a very high mechanical advantage, due to the need to make room for large plates over a large [[range of motion]] following a path that causes them to converge at one end or the other.  Also, the motion will generally not be vertical, and the net resistance is equal to the cosine of the angle at which it is moving relative to vertical.

For example, consider an incline press machine that is a single-lever machine that has the plates halfway up the lever from the handles to the [[Lever|fulcrum]], and begins moving the plates at a 45-[[Degree (angle)|degree]] angle from vertical.  The lever will provide a leverage advantage of 2:1, and the incline will have an advantage of 1:√2/2, for a net mechanical advantage of {{nowrap|(4/√2):1 ≈ 2.8:1}}.  Thus {{nowrap|50 [[Kilogram|kg]]}} ({{nowrap|~491 [[Newton (unit)|N]]}}) of plates will apply to the user only an equaling weight of {{nowrap|18 kg}} or a force of {{nowrap|~174 N}} at the beginning of the motion.

On the other end of the spectrum may be a bent-over-row machine that is designed with the user's grip between the plates and the fulcrum.  This amplifies the force needed by the user relative to the weight of the plates.

'''Witkey''' (威客; ''Wei Ke'' in [[Pinyin]]) is a web-based system whereby users can exchange and purchase services and information, [[Sharing knowledge|share knowledge]] and experience in order to save time and money.
 
Generally, requests posted are of the type not easily answered on a general internet [[search engine]] and can be of either a personal or professional nature. Students and professionals alike post requests for help with research and even answers to homework. More and more of these requests are being posted on one of the ever-growing number of Witkey websites. There are 338 million internet users (or ''netizens'') in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and this is increasing.  The number of recorded Witkey users in [[People's Republic of China|China]] is estimated at 600,000 and is set to increase to 9 million by 2007 according to the [[Beijing]]-based [[CCID Consulting]] Co.

The requests are usually answered for a small fee which is worked out in points through the company running the Witkey website itself,  which in turn are exchangeable for cash.  From [[RMB]] 50 for a quick know-how answer to a small technological query to around RMB 1,000 to help a company come up with a logo design, with even higher amounts being paid out for more diverse services such as scientific research and analysis.

The Witkey industry is predicted to grow as it proves popular with providers and clients alike, results are generally good and although the work can be demanding it can be done from home and the hours are flexible and, since you only need an internet connection to take on work as a Witkey, even those in remote areas are able to get in on the action as all of the services provided are carried out over the internet.

There are of course some negative points to the system which relies heavily on trust between providers and clients and provisions are seen to be taken to allow for a more comprehensive monitoring of the Witkey system in the future.

A latest research by CCW Research shows that 51.2% interviewees think that the most important task for Witkey sites presently is to improve consumer experience, facilitating customer activities of task publication and worker/works’ match, as well as securing personal privacy etc. Analyst CCW Research points out that Witkey site operators have to treat this problem seriously and work out a series of high-level service on customers’ stand. It is believed that the improvement of consumer experience will help to build a good fame of Witkey website and new customers and Witkey workers will be gathered nonstoply. 
 
There are 9.7 percent interviewees expect a better clustering and more detailed classification of Witkey websites as skilled workers are not willing to participate in an irrelevant working project while customers doubt about abilities of Witkey workers.

witkey(威客; Wei Ke in Pinyin) is a synthesis of word, its literal translation is the key to open the wisdom. Translation is to use the wisdom of the masses to solve the difficulties of a person or a difficult matter, so that the parties out of the woods, get the correct answer in an effective way.
