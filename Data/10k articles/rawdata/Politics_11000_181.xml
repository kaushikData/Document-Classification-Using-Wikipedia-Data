'''Anglican Mainstream''' is a conservative [[Anglican]] organization from the [[Church of England]]. It describes itself as "a community within the [[Anglican Communion]] committed to promote, teach and maintain the Scriptural truths on which the Anglican Church was founded".{{cn|date=July 2012}} It is best known through its website, which posts items of interest or concern to its constituency. The convenor of the organization's UK steering committee is [[Philip Giddings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/anglican-mainstream-who-we-are/ Anglican Mainstream: Who we are]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain and Ireland==
It brings together Anglicans in the British Isles who are concerned to maintain a traditional position on controversial issues. Participating organisations include evangelical groups in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, such as [[Reform (Anglican)|Reform]], [[Church Society]], the Church of England Evangelical Council, the New Wine network, the Scottish Anglican Network and mission agencies. It has close links with similar groups in North America and South Africa.

==Anglican realignment==
Anglican Mainstream is also involved in partnering with growing churches in the developing world through Anglican International Development (AID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interanglicanaid.org/ |title=International Anglican Aid |publisher=Interanglicanaid.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has strong links with the [[Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fca.net/ |title=Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans |publisher=Fca.net |date=2008-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supports the [[Anglican realignment]] and the [[Global Anglican Future Conference]] (GAFCON).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gafcon.org/ |title=Global Anglican Future |publisher=GAFCON |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social conservatism==
{{Main|Homosexuality and Anglicanism}}
Anglican Mainstream is concerned about a number of social issues including abortion and end of life issues, the status of marriage and family, evangelism, the cultural challenge of secular society and general Anglican church life in Britain and overseas. Of all the issues with which it is concerned, its stance on issues of sexuality has drawn controversy, particularly its support for sexual abstinence for homosexual people and the [[ex-gay movement]], which it considers to be a minority group often ignored or silenced. Liberal pro-homosexuality groups such as Changing Attitude have been particularly opposed to Anglican Mainstream, especially over their view that homosexual orientation is an unalterable fact of human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=January 30th, 2012 |url=http://changingattitude.org.uk/archives/5057 |title=The shocking failure of Anglican Mainstream’s cure for homosexual ‘lepers’ |publisher=Changing Attitude |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The
Royal College of Psychiatrists believes strongly in evidence based treatment. There is no sound scientific evidence that sexual orientation can be changed. Furthermore,
so-called treatments of homosexuality create a setting in which prejudice and discrimination flourish." http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/rcpsychposstatementsexorientation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Anglican Mainstream was part of a coalition of Christian groups intending to run a two-week campaign in which some [[London]] buses would carry an advertisement reading “Not gay! Post-gay, ex-gay and proud. Get over it!” in the same style as adverts produced by [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], the gay rights group. The intention was to draw attention to the existence of ex-gays and the possibility of change, a claim which is contradicted by some mainstream psychologists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/2012/04/12/london-bus-campaign-challenges-stonewalls-claim-that-gay-is-innate/ |title=Blog Archive » London bus campaign challenges Stonewall’s claim that “gay” is innate |publisher=Anglican Mainstream |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving appropriate permissions the campaign was then prohibited by London's mayor, [[Boris Johnson]], because of the offence he believed it would cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pippa Crerar, City Hall Editor |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/mayor/boris-johnson-why-i-banned-gay-cure-bus-ads-7660738.html?origin=internalSearch |title=Boris Johnson: 'Why I banned gay cure bus ads' - Mayor - News - Evening Standard |publisher=Thisislondon.co.uk |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/2012/04/19/anglican-mainstream-accuses-london-mayor-of-censorship/ |title=Blog Archive » Anglican Mainstream accuses London Mayor of Censorship |publisher=Anglican Mainstream |date=2012-04-19 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase '''bellum se ipsum alet''' ({{lang-en|The war will feed itself}}) or '''bellum se ipsum alit'''&lt;ref&gt;Cooper (1979), p.402&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-en|The war feeds itself}}, {{lang-fr|La guerre doit se nourrir elle-même}}),&lt;ref name=Cadiou579580&gt;Cadiou (2008), pp.579–580&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[German language|German]] rendering ''Der Krieg ernährt den Krieg''&lt;ref name=Kudla221&gt;Kudla (2001), p.221&lt;/ref&gt; describe the [[military strategy]] of feeding and funding armies primarily with the resources of occupied territories. The phrase, coined by [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] statesman [[Cato the Elder]], is primarily associated with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648).

==The phrase==
[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Cato the Elder|Cato]], coined the phrase in 195 BC]]

The phrase ''bellum se ipsum alit'' was first mentioned in ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab urbe condita libri]]'' XXXIV,9,12, written by [[Roman Empire|Roman historian]] [[Livy|Titus Livius (Livy)]] (59 BC-17 AD), who attributed it to [[Cato the Elder|Cato Marcus Porcius ("the Elder", 234–149 BC)]], a statesman in [[Ancient Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauterbach (2002), p.101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Demandt (1978), p.60&lt;/ref&gt; According to Livy, Cato in 195 BC used the phrase during the [[Roman_Conquest_of_Hispania#The_wars_of_conquest|conquest of Hispania]] when he refused to buy additional supplies for his army in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]] ([[Hispania]], modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]).&lt;ref name=Cadiou579580/&gt;

The slogan became prominent in reference to the [[Thirty Years' War]]. [[Friedrich Schiller]] in his retrospect, semi-historical drama [[Wallenstein (play)|Wallenstein]] (I/2, ''The [[Piccolomini]]''),&lt;ref name=Kudla221/&gt; has [[Johann Ludwig Hektor von Isolani]], a general in [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]]'s army, say these words in a conversation with other commanders:&lt;ref&gt;Schiller (1798) in Alt (2004), p.319&lt;/ref&gt;

==The strategy==
===Thirty Years' War===
{{further|Raubwirtschaft}}
Prior to the [[Thirty Years' War]], the laws of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] provided for funding armies by raising special war taxes.&lt;ref name=Krueger37&gt;Krüger (2005), p.37&lt;/ref&gt; The funds needed for the large armies raised during the war however exceeded the income of the respective warlords from those taxes, and forced them to resort to additional, unfavourable measures such as borrowing of money and currency depreciation.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; In the course of the war, the principle of ''bellum se ipsum alet'' was applied in two phases: First, the food supplies needed for the army were derived directly from the territory occupied by this army.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; Later, the pay for the soldiers was derived from the occupied territory as well.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt;

[[File:Johann Tserclaes Tilly.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly|Tilly]],  the first to implement ''bellum se ipsum alet'' on occupied enemy territory in 1623]]

In 1623, the principle was implemented by the [[Upper Saxon Circle]] on its own territory, and by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], commander of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]]'s army, on occupied enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; The Upper Saxon Circle had raised an army for its defense, and dispersed it over its territory.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; The territory was divided into ''Kontributionsbezirke'' ("contribution districts"), each of which had to provide certain amounts of food for the soldiers as well as the horses.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; The soldiers were quartered in the houses of ordinary people, who had to provide shelter, food and ''Servisgeld'', a defined sum to allow the soldier to buy firewood and salt.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; 

These measures were self-imposed by the circle's nobility, and the local authorities were given the task of their implementation.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; In contrast, Tilly imposed analogous measures in the same year on a territory he had just conquered, [[Hersfeld]].&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt; The contributions he demanded were unreasonably high, and were collected with military means.&lt;ref name=Krueger37/&gt;

In 1625, [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] had promised [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] to raise an army and fund it himself.&lt;ref name=Beier151&gt;Beier (1997), p.151&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand II allowed Wallenstein to exploit occupied territory&lt;ref group=nb name=fii&gt;Ferdinand II: "[...] in den eroberten Orten und Landschaften zur Erhaltung der Soldatesca leidliche Contributiones und Anlagen zu machen." Krüger (1995), pp.37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; with the caveat that money should not be collected by force without his approval.&lt;ref name=Krueger38&gt;Krüger (2005), p.38&lt;/ref&gt; This caveat was however neglected,&lt;ref name=Krueger38/&gt; and the army was fed and paid entirely by contributions and war loot.&lt;ref name=Beier151/&gt; Subsequently, all armies participating in the war adapted the ''bellum se ipsum alet'' principle.&lt;ref name=Krueger38/&gt; 

Contributions from occupied territories, divided into ''Kontributionsbezirke'', were collected by military force and by local authorities forced to cooperate.&lt;ref name=Krueger38/&gt; The affected territories were thereby ruined.&lt;ref name=Krueger38/&gt; The need to borrow money to satisfy the military demands during the Thirty Years' War resulted in an indebtedness that many German communities bore until the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Krueger38/&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Goeringcaptivity2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Hermann Göring|Göring]] applied ''bellum se ipsum alet'' on occupied Soviet territory in 1942]]

During [[World War II]] [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941. The conquered territories did not return as many resources as the Nazis had expected, due to previous shortfalls of the Soviet [[planned economy]] and the devastations during the conquest.&lt;ref name=Neumaerker144&gt;Neumärker (2007), p.144&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Reichsmarschall'' [[Hermann Göring]] implemented restrictions on the local population to prevent the [[Altreich (pre-1938 Nazi Germany)|Altreich]] and the army from falling short of food supplies.&lt;ref name=Neumaerker144/&gt; 

Aware of the consequences of these measures, Göring in September 1941 foretold "the largest starvation since the Thirty Years' War" in the occupied areas.&lt;ref group=nb name=hg1&gt;Göring: "[...] das größte Sterben seit dem Dreißigjährigen Krieg." Neumärker (2007), p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neumaerker144/&gt; In 1942, he explicitly described the Nazi strategy in these territories as ''bellum se ipsum alet''.&lt;ref group=nb name=hg&gt;Göring: "Der Krieg ernährt den Krieg. Das wird jetzt ganz groß geschrieben." Neumärker (2007), p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neumaerker144/&gt;

'''Bento Gonçalves''' (September 23, 1788 in [[Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul|Triunfo]] &amp;ndash; July 18, 1847 in [[Guaíba|Pedras Brancas]]), was an army officer, politician, monarchist and rebel leader of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. He was the first President of the [[Riograndense Republic]] and is considered by many to be one of the most important figures in the history of [[Rio Grande do Sul]].

Although a staunch monarchist,{{sfn|Rodrigues|1990|p=380}} Gonçalves led the rebel forces in the [[Ragamuffin War]]. Radicals within the rebel ranks forced the rebellion to become republican, something that Gonçalves opposed.{{sfn|Rodrigues|1990|p=372}} Still, even though he fought against the Empire, Gonçalves and his troops celebrated the birthday of the young Emperor Dom [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].{{sfn|Rodrigues|1990|p=382}} After the conflict ended with the victory of the Empire, Gonçalves paid his respect to Pedro II by kissing his hand during the latter's trip to Rio Grande do Sul in December 1845.{{sfn|Rodrigues|1990|p=382}} 

His main companions in arms during the rebellion were [[Antônio de Souza Neto]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

'''''Case No. 111-97-TC''''' is a [[landmark decision]] by the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Ecuador]] on November 25, 1997, regarding the country's [[sodomy laws]]. The newly created tribunal unanimously overturned as unconstitutional the first paragraph of Article 516 of the Penal Code, which criminalized sexual activities between persons of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Diario Hoy. [http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/parcial-despenalizacion-de-la-homosexualidad-112723.html ''Parcial Despenalizacion De La Homosexualidad''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204225436/http://www.explored.com.ec/noticias-ecuador/parcial-despenalizacion-de-la-homosexualidad-112723.html |date=December 4, 2014 }}. Retrieved on 27 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The case was the first step towards increasing recognition of [[LGBT rights in Ecuador]]. The following year, Ecuador became the first country in the [[Americas]] (and only the third in the world after [[South Africa]] and [[Fiji]]){{citation needed|date=April 2013}} to include sexual orientation as a protected category in its constitution.

The tribunal's decision was not wholeheartedly received by LGBT rights activists, who criticized its characterization of homosexuality as "abnormal conduct" that should be treated medically rather than penally sanctioned. The tribunal was accused of being traditional-minded for stating that "it is clear that even though [homosexuality] should not be a judicially punishable conduct, the protection of the family and of minors requires that it not be a socially exalted conduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salgado |first=Judith |title=Análisis de la interpretación de inconstitucionalidad de la penalización de la homosexualidad en el Ecuador |journal=Aportes Andinos |issue=11 |publisher=Universidad Andina Simón Bolívar |location=Quito |date=October 2004 |url=http://www.uasb.edu.ec/padh/revista11/articulos/judith%20salgado.htm |accessdate=March 26, 2008 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327122227/http://www.uasb.edu.ec/padh/revista11/articulos/judith%20salgado.htm |archivedate=March 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision was also criticized by [[social conservatives]] opposed to the decriminalization of homosexuality altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ab.

{{Main article|Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid}}
This article attempts to summarize and illustrate selected notable representative critical reaction to and commentary on the book '''''Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid''''' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2006) by former president [[Jimmy Carter]], which has been highly controversial.  The reception of the book has itself raised further controversy, occasioning Carter's own subsequent responses to such criticism.

==Critical reaction and commentary: brief summary==
{{Main article|Palestine Peace Not Apartheid}}
Critical response to ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' has been mixed. Some journalists and academics have praised what they regard as Carter's courage for speaking honestly about the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] in a media environment which is hostile to opponents of Israel's policies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=538063&amp;agid=16&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, have been more negative. According to Julie Bosman, criticism of the book "has escalated to a full-scale furor", much of which has focused on Carter's use of the word ''[[apartheid]]'' in the subtitle.&lt;ref name=Bosman&gt;Julie Bosman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/books/14cart.html?fta=y "Carter View of Israeli 'Apartheid' Stirs Furor,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' December 12, 2006, accessed March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the book's critics, including several leaders of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of [[American Jew]]ish organizations, have interpreted the subtitle as an [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|allegation of Israeli apartheid]], which they believe to be inflammatory and unsubstantiated.&lt;ref name=BrandeisNews&gt;[http://my.brandeis.edu/news/item?news_item_id=7816 "Brandeis News: Full coverage of the Historic Jan. 23rd Visit by Former President Jimmy Carter"], [[Brandeis University]], January 24, 2007, accessed January 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selected notable representative positive reactions to the book===

====Journalists and other media commentators====
In his review published on October 15, 2006, Brad Hooper, editor at ''[[Booklist]]'', concludes: "The former president's ideas are expressed with perfect clarity; his book, of course, represents a personal point of view, but one that is certainly grounded in both knowledge and wisdom. His outlook on the problem not only contributes to the literature of debate surrounding it but also, just as importantly, delivers a worthy game plan for clearing up the dilemma."&lt;ref&gt;Brad Hooper, Review of ''Palestine: Peace, Not Apartheid'', ''[[Booklist]]'' ([[American Library Association]]), October 15, 2006, accessed January 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Israeli historian and author [[Tom Segev]] believes his principal argument is "well-founded".&lt;ref name=Segev&gt;[[Tom Segev]], [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/801270.html "Memoir of a Great Friend"], ''[[Haaretz]]'' December 12, 2006, accessed January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raja Shehadeh]], a lawyer and author, including of ''Occupier’s Law: Israel and the West Bank'', regards ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' as a "fresh debate" on [[Israel]]'s policies in the [[West Bank]]. Shehadeh believes that "With his well documented book and its provocative title, Carter is working to achieve 'one of the major goals of [his] life' as he makes clear at the outset of his book: 'to help ensure a lasting peace for Israelis and others in the Middle East.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Raja Shehadeh]], [http://www.calitreview.com/Reviews/palestine_107.htm "Fresh Debate on Israel's West Bank Policies"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509190232/http://www.calitreview.com/Reviews/palestine_107.htm |date=May 9, 2007}}, ''[[California Literary Review]]'' December 19, 2006, accessed May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fisk]] declares that the book is "a good, strong read by the only American president approaching sainthood", adding: "Needless to say, the American press and television largely ignored the appearance of this eminently sensible book – until the usual Israeli lobbyists began to scream abuse at poor old Jimmy Carter, albeit that he was the architect of the longest lasting peace treaty between Israel and an Arab neighbour – Egypt – secured with the famous 1978 Camp David accords."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Fisk]], [http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/article2097774.ece "Banality and Bare Faced Lies,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115040408/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/fisk/article2097774.ece |date=January 15, 2007}} ''[[The Independent]]'' December 23, 2006, accessed January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl L. Brown in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' writes: "This book offers a historical overview in the form of a personal memoir, tracing developments since the 1970s as Carter experienced and understood them. He may thus be said to be both a source for the historian and himself a historian of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israeli–Palestinian confrontation]]. This little book merits a reading on both counts. Carter concludes that "Israel's continued control and colonization of Palestinian land have been the primary obstacles to a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land." That statement, so out of line with the way mainstream American political figures (even those retired from public office) frame the issue, ensures that the book will be attacked by many. Perhaps it will be read as well."&lt;ref name=LCBrown&gt;L.

[[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]], Middle East editor at ''[[The Guardian]]'', writes "Controversy about the book flows largely from the word "apartheid" in the title: it is wrong if applied to Israel within its pre-1967 borders, where there is discrimination but not institutionalised racism. In the West Bank, with its confiscated land, unequal allocation of water resources, fortress-like settlements, security fence and segregated roads, it is fitting enough. No one who has seen subjugated Palestinians struggling with everyday life alongside armed Jewish settlers can quarrel with it".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/17/politics Divided loyalties], ''The Guardian'' (17 February 2007), accessed September 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In his blog, [[Tony Karon]], a senior editor at [[TIME.com]] and a former anti-apartheid activist for the [[ANC]], states "The point being that Jimmy Carter had to write this book precisely because Palestinian life and history is not accorded equal value in American discourse, far from it. And his use of the word apartheid is not only morally valid; it is essential, because it shakes the moral stupor that allows many liberals to rationalize away the daily, grinding horror being inflicted on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza".&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonykaron.com/2006/12/22/israel-and-apartheid-in-defense-of-jimmy-carter/ Israel and Apartheid: In Defense of Jimmy Carter], (December 22, 2006) retrieved September 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Nation]]'', Michael F.

He continues: "We know that critique is often an essential part of love and caring. That is precisely what Jimmy Carter is trying to do for Israel and the Jewish people in his new book".

[[Ali Abunimah]], editor of the ''[[Electronic Intifada]]'', writing in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', concludes "President Carter has done what few American politicians have dared to do: speak frankly about the Israel–Palestine conflict. He has done this nation, and the cause of peace, an enormous service by focusing attention on what he calls "the abominable oppression and persecution in the occupied Palestinian territories, with a rigid system of required passes and strict segregation between Palestine's citizens and Jewish settlers in the West Bank." Calling Carter "the most successful Arab-Israeli peace negotiator to date", Abunimah praises him for having "braved a storm of criticism, including the insinuation from the [[pro-Israel]] [[Anti-Defamation League]] that his arguments are [[antisemitic|anti-Semitic.]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali Abunimah]], [http://www.opinionsource.com/article.jsp?articleidentifier=16093&amp;password=1167114105453 A Palestinian View of Jimmy Carter's Book]{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 28, 2006, editorial (required subscription for online access); rpt. in [http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=11729 ''Z Magazine''] {{webarchive|url=https://swap.stanford.edu/20081218205259/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=11729 |date=December 18, 2008}} (part of ''[[Z Communications]]'') December 28, 2006, accessed January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Academics====
South African professor of international law [[John Dugard]] observes that while Carter's book "is igniting controversy for its Israel and the apartheid analogy" he understands the deeper rationale for Carter's analogy as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since 1967 [[Israel]] has imposed its control over the Palestinian territories in the manner of a colonizing power, under the guise of occupation. It has permanently seized the territories' most desirable parts—the holy sites in [[East Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]] and [[Bethlehem]] and the fertile agricultural lands along the western border and in the [[Jordan River|Jordan Valley]]—and settled its own Jewish "colonists" throughout the land. Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories has many features of [[colonization]]. At the same time it has many of the worst characteristics of apartheid. ... Many aspects of Israel's occupation surpass those of the apartheid regime. Israel's large-scale destruction of Palestinian homes, leveling of agricultural lands, military incursions and targeted assassinations of Palestinians far exceed any similar practices in [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid South Africa]]. No wall was ever built to separate blacks and whites.&lt;ref name=Dugard&gt;[[John Dugard]], [http://www.ajc.com/search/content/opinion/stories/2006/11/29/1129edcarter.html "Israelis Adopt What South Africa Dropped,"] ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' November 29, 2006.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], former [[National Security Adviser]] to President Carter, agrees with the main thesis of the book: President Carter, in my judgement, is correct in fearing that the absence of a fair and mutually acceptable resolution of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] is likely to produce a situation which de facto will resemble apartheid: i.e., two communities living side by side but repressively separated, with one enjoying prosperity and seizing the lands of the other, and the other living in poverty and deprivation. That is an outcome which must be avoided and I interpret his book as a strong plea for accommodation, which needs to be actively promoted by morally responsible engagement especially by America. Brzezinski also condemns the "abusive reactions directed at Carter, including some newspaper ads" for being "objectionable and designed to intimidate an open public discussion."&lt;ref name=Brzezinski&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/a2be2f0e-83c4-11db-9e95-0000779e2340.html Ask the Expert: US policy in the Middle East], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], London ''[[The Financial Times|Financial Times]]'' December 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] professor of English literature [[Saree Makdisi]] writes in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' that "Carter's apartheid charge rings true", observing: "Israel maintains two sets of rules and regulations in the West Bank: one for Jews, one for non-Jews. The only thing wrong with using the word 'apartheid' to describe such a repugnant system is that the South African version of [[institutionalized discrimination]] was never as elaborate as its Israeli counterpart—nor did it have such a vocal chorus of defenders among otherwise liberal Americans."&lt;ref&gt;Saree Makdisi, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/12/20/EDGOULJ69N1.DTL "On the New Book 'Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid'"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an essay published in ''[[The Nation]]'', [[Henry Siegman]], former executive director of the [[American Jewish Congress]], and visiting professor at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]], begins by observing that the "book's title more than its content" caused an "uproar" even prior to publication, because it "seemed to suggest that the avatar of [[democracy in the Middle East]] may be on its way to creating a political order that resembles South Africa's apartheid model of discrimination and repression, albeit on ethnic-religious rather than racial grounds" and provoked such controversy due to "the ignorance of the American political establishment, both Democrat and Republican, on the subject of the Israel-Palestine conflict"; in Siegman's view: "Carter's harsh condemnation of Israeli policies in the occupied territories is not the consequence of ideology or of an anti-Israel bias."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Siegman, [http://www.thenation.com/article/hurricane-carter "Hurricane Carter,"] online posting, ''[[The Nation]]'' January 4, 2007 (issue of January 22, 2007), accessed January 5, 2007 (4 pages).

[[Norman Finkelstein]], an assistant professor of political science at [[DePaul University]], defends Carter's analysis in ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' as both historically accurate and non-controversial outside the United States: "After four decades of Israeli occupation, the infrastructure and superstructure of apartheid have been put in place. Outside the never-never land of mainstream American Jewry and U.S. media[,] this reality is barely disputed."&lt;ref name=FinkelsteinCP&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein]], [http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein12282006.html The Ludicrous Attacks on Jimmy Carter's Book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112184427/http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein12282006.html |date=2007-01-12}}, ''[[CounterPunch]]'' December 28, 2006, accessed January 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In several subsequent [http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/content.php?pg=9 "Speaking engagements"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227104210/http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/content.php?pg=9 |date=February 27, 2007}} as these are featured on his website (accessed February 13, 2007), Finkelstein has apparently been focusing on the subject of Carter's book ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

George Bisharat, a professor at the [[University of California, Hastings College of Law]], begins his "Commentary" on the book in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' of January 2, 2007: "Americans owe a debt to former President Jimmy Carter for speaking long hidden but vital truths. His book ''Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid'' breaks the taboo barring criticism in the United States of Israel's discriminatory treatment of Palestinians.

===Selected notable representative negative reactions to the book===

====Journalists and other media commentators====
In "It's Not Apartheid", published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', columnist [[Michael Kinsley]] states that Carter "makes no attempt to explain [the use of the word 'apartheid']" which he calls "a foolish and unfair comparison, unworthy of the man who won – and deserved – the Nobel Peace Prize." To start with, no one has yet thought to accuse Israel of creating a phony country in finally acquiescing to the creation of a Palestinian state. Palestine is no [[Bantustan]]. Furthermore, Israel has always had Arab citizens. No doubt many Israelis have racist attitudes toward Arabs, but the official philosophy of the government is quite the opposite, and sincere efforts are made to, for example, instill humanitarian and egalitarian attitudes in children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kinsley]]. [http://www.slate.com/id/2155277/fr/rss/ "It's Not Apartheid"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' December 11, 2006, accessed March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kinsley, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/11/AR2006121101225.html "It's Not Apartheid"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' December 12, 2006, accessed March 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[National Review]]'' editor [[Rich Lowry]] says that "Carter always finds a way to point a finger at Israel." Yes, there are two sides to every dispute, and heaven knows the Palestinian people have suffered throughout the past six decades, but Carter apes the Palestinian position and calls it evenhandedness. Lowry feels the "book marks Carter's further disgraceful descent from ineffectual president and international do-gooder to apologist for the worst Arab tendencies", citing a passage from the book.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rich Lowry]].

In "Jews, Arabs and Jimmy Carter", deputy foreign editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Ethan Bronner]] draws attention to what he describes as "the narrowness of Carter’s perspective" and argues that Carter fails to highlight legitimate objections to Israel's current policies in the course of "simply offer[ing] a narrative that is largely unsympathetic to Israel" while engaging in some "misrepresentations ... [which] are a shame because most of what Carter focuses on is well worth reading about." To Bronner, "Carter's picture feels like yesterday's story, especially since Israel's departures from southern [[Lebanon]] and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] have not stopped anti-Israel violence from those areas. ... This book has something of a [[Rip van Winkle]] feel to it, as if little had changed since Carter diagnosed the problem in the 1970s." Despite his own disagreements with aspects of the book and his acknowledgment that Carter overstates his case in it, Bronner finds that others have criticized the book "unfairly": "Their biggest complaint against the book—a legitimate one—is the word "[[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]]" in the title, with its false echo of the racist policies of the old South Africa. But [[hyperbole|overstatement]] hardly adds up to [[antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]."

''[[The Economist]]'' reviewed ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'' and found it to be "a weak one, simplistic and one-sided ...

In "What Would Jimmy Do?", published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' Book World, [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] describes Carter as a "partisan of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]" who has offered a "notably benign view of [[Hamas]]" and who, he alleges, creates "sins to hang around the necks of [[Jews]] when no sins have actually been committed" as Carter "blames Israel almost entirely for perpetuating the hundred-year war between Arab and Jew."&lt;ref name=goldberg&gt;[[Jeffrey Goldberg]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/07/AR2006120701835.html?referrer=emailarticle "What Would Jimmy Do?"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' December 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Question of Carter's Cash", [[Claudia Rosett]] writes, "Even in Carter's long history of post-presidential grandstanding, this book sets fresh standards of irresponsibility. Purporting to give a balanced view of the Palestinian–Israeli conflict, Carter effectively shrugs off such highly germane matters as Palestinian terrorism.

====Representatives of organizations====
Prior to the book's publication, during the [[U.S. midterm election]] campaign period in the third week of October 2006, several prominent Democrats criticized both the book and the author, a fellow Democrat.

In an "Op-Ed" published on December 4 in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', David A. Harris, executive director of the [[American Jewish Committee]] (AJC), says that he finds it "startling that a former president who prides himself on his ongoing contribution to world peace would write a crude polemic that compromises any pretense to objectivity and fairness": "Carter leaves out what any reasonable observer, even those that share his basic views of the conflict, would consider obvious facts, but does include stunning distortions".;&lt;ref name=Harris1&gt;David A.

The second "manifest distortion," according to Harris, is that "Carter states that Israel plans to build a security fence 'along the Jordan River, which is now planned as the eastern leg of the encirclement of the Palestinians'"; whereas well-informed observers know that "Israel has modified the projected route of the security fence on numerous occasions (the current route roughly tracks the parameters that Clinton advanced to the parties in negotiations) and that there is no plan to hem the Palestinians in on the eastern border." In omitting "these well-known developments," Harris argues, Carter is "leaving readers to think that a route that was once contemplated in proposed maps but never adopted or acted upon represents current reality."&lt;ref name=Harris2/&gt;

In an unsolicited handwritten letter replying to Harris, former President [[Bill Clinton]] expresses gratitude for Harris' articles on behalf of the [[American Jewish Committee]] critiquing the book: "Dear David, Thanks so much for your articles about President Carter's book.

This is not a matter of interpretation."&lt;ref name=ross/&gt; Ross concluded: "President Carter made a major contribution to peace in the Middle East. That's the reality.

[[Alan Dershowitz]], a professor of law at [[Harvard Law School]], claims that Carter's book is "riddled with errors and bias."&lt;ref name=DershowitzGlobe&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz]], [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/12/21/why_wont_carter_debate_his_book/ "Why Won't Carter Debate His Book?"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' December 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz argues that there are factual inaccuracies in ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'', including its statement that "Israel launched a preemptive attack on Jordan", observing that, in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], "Jordan attacked Israel first, Israel tried desperately to persuade Jordan to remain out of the war, and Israel counterattacked after the Jordanian army surrounded Jerusalem, firing missiles into the center of the city."&lt;ref name=Dershowitz&gt;[[Alan Dershowitz]], [http://www.nysun.com/article/43958 "The World According to Carter,"] ''[[The New York Sun|New York Sun]]'', November 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an open letter published in ''[[The New York Sun]]'', [[Kenneth Stein|Kenneth W. Stein]], Director of the [[Institute for the Study of Modern Israel]] of [[Emory University]], who was the founder of the Middle East program at the [[Carter Center]] and the Center's first director (February 1984 – 1986), presents criticisms of the book as follows: "President Carter's book on the Middle East, a title too inflammatory to even print, is not based on unvarnished analysis; it is replete with factual errors, copied materials not cited, superficialities, glaring omissions, and simply invented segments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|title=President Carter's New Book Spurs Aide To Resign|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/44869|work=[[The New York Sun|New York Sun]]|date=December 8, 2006|accessdate=December 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter sent to President Carter and others, Stein also observes: "Aside from the one-sided nature of the book, meant to provoke, there are recollections cited from meetings where I was the third person in the room, and my notes of those meetings show little similarity to points claimed in the book." He adds: "Being a former President does not give one a unique privilege to invent information or to unpack it with cuts, deftly slanted to provide a particular outlook.

Rebecca Trounson reports in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'': Stein presented details of the book's perceived errors; among the most serious, Stein says that Carter misrepresented [[UN Resolution 242]] and gave a false account of a meeting held with former Syrian President [[Hafez Assad]] in 1990, which Stein attended and has the transcript of.&lt;ref name=Trounson&gt;Rebecca Trounson, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-carter13jan13,1,5006028.story "Former Aide Criticizes Carter Over Mideast Book:] In L.A., Kenneth Stein Says 'falsehoods' in Book on Mideast Prompted His Resignation," ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', January 13, 2007, accessed January 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gil Troy]], professor of history at [[McGill University]], opines: "[I]f Carter is so innocent as to be unaware of the resonance that term has [apartheid], [then] he is not the expert on the Middle East or world affairs he purports to be." He elaborates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sadly, Israelis and Palestinians do not enjoy the kind of harmony the Israeli Declaration of Independence envisioned. Carter and his comrades use "Apartheid" as shorthand to condemn some of the security measures improvised recently. ... Israel built a security fence to protect its citizens and separate Palestinian enclaves from Israeli cities. Ironically, that barrier marks Israel's most dramatic recognition of Palestinian aspirations to independence since Israel signed the Oslo Accords in 1993. ... Applying the Apartheid label tries to ostracize Israel by misrepresenting some of the difficult decisions Israel has felt forced to make in fighting Palestinian terror.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gil Troy]], [http://hnn.us/articles/32916.html "On Jimmy Carter's False Apartheid Analogy,"] [[History News Network]] December 18, 2006, accessed January 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published on January 20, 2007, in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Deborah Lipstadt]], the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at [[Emory University]], criticized Carter for what she calls his "Jewish Problem", complaining that, now "facing a storm of criticism, he has relied on anti-Semitic stereotypes in defense."&lt;ref name=Lipstadt&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011901541.html "Jimmy Carter's Jewish Problem,"] ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 20, 2007, accessed February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more-recent public appearance at a rally in London, in the first week of February 2007, Lipstadt charged that, in this book, Carter engages in what she terms "soft-core [[Holocaust denial|denial]]".&lt;ref name=Paul2&gt;Qtd. by Jonny Paul, [https://archive.is/20130706010413/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359797134&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/Printer "Jerusalem Post Holocaust Scholar Warns of New 'soft-core' Denial"], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', February 6, 2007, accessed February 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul, "She received huge applause when she asked how former US President Jimmy Carter could omit the years 1939–1947 from a chronology in his book"; referring to him and to ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'', she said: "'When a former president of the United States writes a book on the Israeli–Palestinian crisis and writes a chronology at the beginning of the book in order to help them understand the emergence of the situation and in that chronology lists nothing of importance between 1939 and 1947, that is soft-core denial.'"&lt;ref name=Paul2/&gt;

==Carter's response to criticism of the book==
Carter has responded to negative reviews in the mainstream [[news media]] in an op-ed published in the ''[[The Los Angeles Times|Los Angeles Times]]'' (which was excerpted in the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' and elsewhere): &lt;blockquote&gt;Book reviews in the mainstream media have been written mostly by representatives of [[Jew]]ish organizations who would be unlikely to visit the occupied territories, and their primary criticism is that the book is anti-Israel. Two members of Congress have been publicly critical. Incoming House [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] for instance, issued a statement (before the book was published) saying that "he does not speak for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] on [[Israel]]." Some reviews posted on [[Amazon.com]] call me "[[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]]," and others accuse the book of "lies" and "distortions." A former [[Carter Center]] fellow has taken issue with it, and [[Alan Dershowitz]] called the book's title "indecent."

Out in the real world, however, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. I've signed books in five stores, with more than 1,000 buyers at each site. I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on [[C-SPAN]] said that I was an [[antisemitic|anti-Semite]]. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have thanked me privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[[Jimmy Carter]], [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-carter8dec08,0,7544738.story "Speaking Frankly about Israel and Palestine"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times|Los Angeles Times]]'' December 8, 2006, accessed December 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;[[Jimmy Carter]], [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/story/0,,1970058,00.html "Israel, Palestine, Peace and Apartheid,"] London ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' December 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Greg Bluestein of the [[Associated Press]] observes, Carter replied generally to charges by Ross, Dershowitz, Stein, and others that his book contains errors and inaccuracies by pointing out that the Carter Center staff as well as an "unnamed 'distinguished' reporter" fact-checked it.&lt;ref name="CarterJV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/120806/D8LSR7J03.shtml |title=Carter defends his book's criticism of Israeli policy |work=[[The Florida Times-Union]] |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in late November 2006, Larry King quoted [[Alan Dershowitz]]'s saying that Carter's "use of the loaded word 'apartheid'[,] suggesting an analogy to [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|the hated policies of South Africa]][,] is especially outrageous" and asked the former president: "What's the analogy? Why use the word apartheid?" Carter replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, he [Dershowitz] has to go to the first word in the title, which is "''Palestine''," not "''Israel''." He should go to the second word in the title, which is "''Peace''."  And then the last two words [are] "''Not Apartheid''."  I never have alleged in the book or otherwise that Israel, as a nation, was guilty of apartheid. But there is a clear distinction between the policies within the [[Israel|nation of Israel]] and within the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]] that Israel controls[,] and the oppression of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] by [[Israeli Defense Forces|Israeli forces]] in the occupied territories is horrendous. And it's not something that has been acknowledged or even discussed in this country. ...

With regard to the criticisms of Kenneth W. Stein, Carter has also pointed out "that Stein hadn't played a role in the [[Carter Center]] in 13 years and that his post as a fellow was an honorary title. 'When I decided to write this book, I didn't even think about involving Ken, from ancient times, to come in and help.'"&lt;ref name="CarterJV"/&gt; Carter's biographer [[Douglas Brinkley]] has observed that Stein and Carter have a "passionate, up-and-down relationship" and that Stein has criticized some of Carter's previous statements about Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christian Boone|url=http://www.ajc.com/search/content/metro/stories/2006/12/06/1206natcarter.html|title=Adviser Breaks with Carter on Mideast Book|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=December 6, 2006

As cited in various news accounts, "Carter has consistently defended his book's accuracy against Stein and other critics"; in a prepared statement, Carter's press secretary Deanna Congileo responds "that Carter had his book reviewed for accuracy throughout the writing process" and that "[a]s with all of President Carter's previous books, any detected errors will be corrected in later editions."&lt;ref name=Zelkowitz&gt;Rachel Zelkowitz, [http://www.emorywheel.com/media/storage/paper919/news/2006/12/12/News/Professor.Describes.Carter.inaccuracies-2532452.shtml?norewrite200701122132&amp;sourcedomain=www.emorywheel.com  "Professor Describes Carter 'Inaccuracies',"]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[The Emory Wheel]]'' December 12, 2006, accessed January 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[Associated Press]]'s request for a comment on the aforementioned resignations of Stein and fourteen other members of the Center's Board of Councilors, speaking on behalf of both Carter and the [[Carter Center]], Ms. Congileo also provided a statement from its executive director John Hardman, who, according to Zelkowitz, "also fact checked ''Palestine'', saying that the members of that board "'are not engaged in implementing the work of the Center.'"&lt;ref name=AccessNoGa /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zelkowitz /&gt;

After receiving 25,000 petitions against his book presented to him by the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], former President Carter sent a hand-written one-sentence note dated January 26, 2007, to the Center's dean and founder, Rabbi [[Marvin Hier]], which the organization posted on its website, in which Carter states: "I don't believe that [[Simon Wiesenthal]] would have resorted to falsehood and slander to raise funds."&lt;ref name="Wiesenthal"&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=fwLYKnN8LzH&amp;b=245494&amp;ct=3525205 "Update: Your Activism At Work:] In Response to 25,000 Petitions, Former President Jimmy Carter Criticizes Wiesenthal Center; Rabbi Hier Responds," press release, [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] January 26, 2007 and February 2, 2007, accessed February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Associated Press]] reports that, "facing continuing controversy over his new book on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]," former President Jimmy Carter "issued a letter ... to American Jews explaining his use of the term '[[apartheid]]' and sympathizing with Israelis who fear [[terrorism]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/16/america/NA_GEN_US_Jimmy_Carter_Criticism.php "Carter Explains Apartheid Reference in Letter to US Jews,"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', December 15, 2006, accessed March 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Carter's "A Letter to Jewish Citizens of America" is posted on the website of the [[Carter Center]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/carter_letter_121506.html "Jimmy Carter Issues Letter to Jewish Community] on ''Palestine Peace Not Apartheid'': A Letter to Jewish Citizens of America," press release, [[Carter Center]], December 15, 2006, accessed December 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further commentaries based on this letter are quoted by John Kelly in his article "The Middle East: Are Critics of Israel Stifled?" in ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' of December 17, 2006.

In an op-ed published on December 20, 2006, in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'',  Carter rejects critics of his book as not actually having addressed the major points contained in it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not surprisingly, an examination of the book reviews and published comments reveals that these points have rarely if ever been mentioned by detractors of the book, much less denied or refuted. Instead, there has been a pattern of ad hominem statements, alleging that I am a liar, plagiarist, anti-Semite, racist, bigot, ignorant, etc. There are frequent denunciations of fabricated "[[straw man]]" accusations: that I have claimed that apartheid exists within Israel; that the system of apartheid in Palestine is based on racism; and that Jews control and manipulate the news media of America.&lt;ref name=reiterating&gt;[[Jimmy Carter]], [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/12/20/reiterating_the_keys_to_peace/ "Reiterating the Keys to Peace,"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' December 20, 2006, accessed May 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter concludes:As recommended by the [[Iraq Study Group Report|Hamilton-Baker report]], renewed negotiations between [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]] are a prime factor in promoting peace in the region.  Although my book concentrates on the [[Palestinian territories]], I noted that the report also recommended peace talks with [[Syria]] concerning the [[Golan Heights]].  Both recommendations have been rejected by Israel's prime minister.
It is practically impossible for bitter antagonists to arrange a time, place, agenda, and procedures that are mutually acceptable, so an outside instigator/promoter is necessary. Successful peace talks were orchestrated by the [[Camp David Accords|United States in 1978–79]] and by [[Oslo Accords|Norway in 1993]]. If the American government is reluctant to assume such a unilateral responsibility, then an alternative is the [[Quartet on the Middle East|International Quartet]] (United States, Russia, the [[United Nations]], and the [[European Union]])—still with American leadership. An overwhelming majority of citizens of [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], and [[Palestinian territories|Palestine]] want peace, with justice for all who live in the [[Holy Land]].  It will be a shame if the world community fails to help them reach this goal.&lt;ref name=reiterating/&gt;{{Further|Palestine Peace Not Apartheid#News accounts, editorials, and letters by others}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)''' is a political group which publishes the ''[[Weekly Worker]]'' newspaper. The party claims to have "an internationalist duty to uphold the principle, 'One state, one party'. To the extent that the [[European Union]] becomes a state then that necessitates EU-wide trade unions and a Communist Party of the EU."&lt;ref name="What we fight for"&gt;{{cite web|title=What we fight for|url=http://cpgb.org.uk/pages/what-we-fight-for/|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it is in favour of the unification of the entire [[working class]] under a new [[Communist International]].&lt;ref name="What we fight for" /&gt;

It is not to be confused with the former [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist–Leninist)]], or the current [[Communist Party of Britain]].

==Formation==
{{Communist Parties}}
The origins of the CPGB (PCC) lie in the [[New Communist Party of Britain]] which split from the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) in 1977. Under the influence of a faction of the [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]], a handful led by NCP youth section leader John Chamberlain (who uses the pseudonym Jack Conrad) attempted to rejoin the then CPGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kick Inside - Revolutionary Opposition in the CPGB, 1945-1991|last=Parker|first=Lawrence|publisher=November Publications|year=2012|isbn=9781291196092|location=London|pages=96-97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few actually regained party cards but the grouping began to publish ''[[The Leninist]]'', first as a journal, then as a more or less monthly paper. Initially ''The Leninist'' appeared to some to be a Stalinist publication in its politics, but over time it mutated into something very different. This may be due to their interaction with various [[Trotskyist]] groups including a series of exchanges with the [[International Communist League (Fourth Internationalist)|Spartacist League]]. The faction developed a critique of the Stalinist states as well as the bureaucratism and political liquidationism of the old CPGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kick Inside - Revolutionary Opposition in the CPGB, 1945-1991|last=Parker|first=Lawrence|publisher=November Publications|year=2012|isbn=9781291196092|location=London|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post CPGB dissolution==
After the dissolution of the 'official' CPGB in 1991, and its relaunch as the [[Democratic Left (UK)|Democratic Left]], the group declared their intention to reforge the party on what they declared to be "firm Leninist principles".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ProSocialism|title=The End of the Party (CPGB)|date=2018-04-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeU4Hn_EcUc|access-date=2018-07-16}}. The 'Leninist' faction is shown picketing the last conference of the CPGB in 1991 that voted to form the Democratic Left.  &lt;/ref&gt; They organised an "emergency conference", at which they claimed the CPGB name, but not its assets. They also changed the name of their paper, increasing its regularity to weekly.

By the early 1990s the group was working closely with the tiny Trotskyist [[Revolutionary Democratic Group]] and the discussion magazine ''Open Polemic''. It also sought to deepen its links with a group of recent ex-members of other Trotskyist groups such as the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] who called themselves the International Socialist Group. The CPGB (PCC) described this process as "Communist rapprochement". The attempt failed as the ISG collapsed and ''Open Polemic'' briefly enrolled a few of its supporters in the CPGB (PCC), only for them to quit in a row over money.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

During the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|general election]] campaign in 1992 [[Ken Livingstone]] claimed that the members of the CPGB (PCC) were "[[MI5]] agents".&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Ford [http://www.cpgb.org.uk/article.php?article_id=1002486 "Ken Livingstone: A man for all seasons"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608062255/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/article.php?article_id=1002486 |date=June 8, 2011 }}, ''Weekly Worker'', 548, 14 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
The group was for a short while embedded in the [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]], but left to join the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]], in which they came to work closely with the [[Alliance for Workers' Liberty]], and proposed a merger of their papers, rejected by the AWL. The two have since politically drifted apart.

In 2004 the group affiliated to the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]]. A minority disagreed with the tactic of working within Respect and formed a faction called the Red Platform. The new faction called instead for the CPGB (PCC) to rejoin a Socialist Alliance reform current called the [[Socialist Alliance Democracy Platform]]. The Red Platform won their aim but the CPGB (PCC) majority continued to work within Respect. Members of the Red Platform subsequently left to create the [[Red Party (UK)|Red Party]] in August 2004 over a disagreement about their views being published in the paper.

The group was active in the [[Campaign for a Marxist Party]] (2006 - 2008) and is critical of the [[Campaign for a New Workers' Party]] and the [[Convention of the Left]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strafford |first1=Chris |title=Left doesn't unite |url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/738/left-doesnt-unite/ |accessdate=25 October 2015 |work=Weekly Worker |issue=738 |date=24 September 2008 |publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001082846/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/738/leftdoesnt.html |archivedate=1 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPGB (PCC) was heavily involved in founding the [[Hands Off the People of Iran]] (HOPI) campaign; [[Mark Fischer (activist)|Mark Fischer]], formerly National Organiser of the CPGB (PCC), is HOPI secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopoi.org/committee.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728203130/http://www.hopoi.org/committee.html|date=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPGB (PCC) also enjoys close links with [[Communist Students (Young Communist League)|Communist Students]].

The CPGB (PCC) endorsed the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|June 2009 European Parliament elections]] and criticised the [[No to EU – Yes to Democracy]] coalition as "[[left-wing nationalism|left-wing nationalist]]."

Non-members such as former Soviet dissident [[Boris Kagarlitsky]], [[Matzpen]] founder [[Moshé Machover]] and Professor [[Hillel Ticktin]] — editor of ''[[Critique (Journal of Socialist Theory)|Critique]]'' and chairman of the ''Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements'', [[University of Glasgow]] — have spoken at CPGB (PCC) events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/cu/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321175539/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/cu/|date=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign for a Marxist Party===
The Campaign for a Marxist Party was a campaign (founded 4 November 2006) run by the CPGB-PCC and other organisations on the [[British left]] for a political party with explicitly Marxist goals as part of a rebuilt workers' international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of the founding principles!|url=http://www.marxistparty.org/index.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20080529093642/http://www.marxistparty.org/index.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 May 2008|website=Marxist Party|accessdate=25 October 2015|date=7 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members were ''[[Critique (Journal of Socialist Theory)|Critique]]'' (who proposed the campaign initially), Communist Party of Great Britain (PCC), and the [[Democratic Socialist Alliance]]. The Irish [[Socialist Democracy (Ireland)|Socialist Democracy]] group welcomed the CMP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Difficult but refreshing alternative|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/650/difficult-but-refreshing-alternative/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=650|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=23 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar socialist campaign groups include [[Campaign for a New Workers' Party]] and [[Convention of the Left]].

The Campaign agreed three founding political principles at the founding conference: 1. We are in favour of a planned, democratic socialist society and against the market; 2. Socialism will be achieved in a single step when the working class seizes power over society, there are no intermediate “democratic” or other stages; 3. The Campaign is against the destructive incubus of Stalinism and will seek to make clear the counter revolutionary and anti-human nature of the Stalinist regimes and Parties. Stalinism was responsible for mass slaughter, brutal incarceration and the atomisation of the people of the countries under its control. In addition the Stalinists were responsible for the most cynical and costly betrayals of the working class everywhere from Germany to South Africa – no Party which has as its aim the liberation of humanity can do other than condemn the Stalinist current and seek to undo the damage done to Marxism by it.

Its seven-member executive mainly consisted of members of the CPGB (PCC) and the ''Democratic Socialist Alliance'' criticised the party for its "hijacking" of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pearson|first1=John|title=Campaign for a Marxist Party – defeat the CPGB hijackers|url=http://www.sademocracy.org.uk/Defeat%20the%20hijackers.htm|website=SadDemocracy.org|publisher=Democratic Socialist Alliance|accessdate=25 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322201345/http://www.sademocracy.org.uk/Defeat%20the%20hijackers.htm|archivedate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of members became known as the Trotskyist Tendency. The campaign published ''Marxist Voice''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxistparty.org/MVoice/MarxistVoicev2i1.pdf] {{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008 it was announced that the CPGB would move to wind up the campaign at its December AGM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conrad|first1=Jack|title=Exploring agreements and disagreements|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/745/exploring-agreements-and-disagreements/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=745|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having done so, it claimed it will establish a new committee to promote "unity of Marxists as Marxists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Godwin|first1=Mary|title=Something serious needed|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/749/something-serious-needed/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=749|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=11 December 2008|quote=The 2008 annual general meeting, held in London on December 6, agreed a motion proposed by the national committee to dissolve the campaign. As the motion explains, some members of the CMP intend to establish a committee in the new year with the aim of promoting the study of Marxism and the unity of Marxists as Marxists. Not the unity of Marxists in  yet another crazy halfway house project.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of members objected to the dissolution of the campaign including in published articles by Dave Spencer,&lt;ref&gt;The Commune, 28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Phil Sharpe&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;New Interventions&lt;/ref&gt; and Steve Freeman.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Communist Platform of Left Unity===
In 2013, the CPGB (PCC) intervened in the campaign for a new left party initiated by film director [[Ken Loach]]. They accused the campaign's initial appeal of making "[[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] platitudes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Left unity appeal: Realise potential, avoid pitfalls|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/956/left-unity-appeal-realise-potential-avoid-pitfalls/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=946|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=4 April 2013|quote=When that strategy was abandoned, so was the 'socialism' of social democracy. Its material support had disappeared. Thus the Keynesian platitudes offered up by Hudson, Loach ''et al'' are ''fantasy politics''. No objective basis exists for them.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for a new formation on the left to have an explicitly Marxist programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conrad|first1=Jack|title=Left Unity: The spirit of '45?|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/961/left-unity-the-spirit-of-45/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=961|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPGB (PCC) described the "politically decrepit" [[Socialist Resistance]] as "the one 'insider' group" in the campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Becker|first1=Tina|title=Left unity: Anti-sectarian sectarianism|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/962/left-unity-anti-sectarian-sectarianism/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=962|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=16 March 2015|quote=Kate Hudson and Andrew Burgin (important driving forces) would have liked the proceedings to have gone differently. After all, the Stop the War Coalition and Respect – organisations both comrades were prominent in – were far more choreographed. But, ironically, bureaucratic coherence in fronts like these was provided by the likes of the Socialist Workers Party, part of the organised left to which LU is to a great extent a reaction. The politically decrepit Socialist Resistance – the one 'insider' group – is no substitute.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused the group of attempting "to relive old Labour-style Keynesian welfarism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Manson|first1=Peter|title=Sectarian left: Svengalis of Left Unity block unity|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/962/sectarian-left-svengalis-of-left-unity-block-unity/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=962|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=16 March 2015|quote=Comrade Thornett is effusive in his praise for Ken Loach's film ''The spirit of '45'', which is "a big defence of socialist and collectivist ideas, and in particular public ownership and public services". That just about sums up SR's attitude and what kind of party it hopes will emerge – one that forlornly attempts to relive old Labour-style Keynesian welfarism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run up to the [[Left Unity (UK)|Left Unity]] (LU) founding conference in November 2013, the CPGB (PCC) launched the Communist Platform in response to the Socialist Platform "[obscuring] the differences between Marxism and a left reading of [[clause four]]-type politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fischer|first1=Mark|title=Left Unity: Communist Platform formed|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/981/left-unity-communist-platform-formed/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=981|publisher=Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=10 October 2013|quote=Logically therefore, the original drafting committee does not believe in these politics and have presumably framed the original text in a way that would obscure the differences between Marxism and a left reading of clause four-type politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They launched the Communist Platform as a permanent tendency in Left Unity on 8 February 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://communistplatform.org.uk/?page_id=16|title=Platform|work=communist platform|accessdate=23 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622191722/http://communistplatform.org.uk/?page_id=16|archivedate=22 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 March 2014, CPGB member Yassamine Mather was elected to Left Unity's National Council at the party's first policy conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leftunity.org/internal-elections-results/|title=Internal elections results|publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the CPGB (PCC) dissolved their Platform and left LU.&lt;ref&gt;http://cpgb.org.uk/pages/news/100/why-were-out-of-left-unity/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour Party===
In 2015, the CPGB (PCC) supported [[Jeremy Corbyn]] in his successful campaign to be elected leader of the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=James Lyons|author2=Robin Henry|title=Hard left plot to infiltrate Labour race|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1585822.ece|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=[[Sunday Times]]|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Labour Leadership Race 'Should Be Halted'|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1525332/labour-leadership-race-should-be-halted|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=[[Sky News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPGB (PCC) has been a supporter of [http://labourpartymarxists.org.uk Labour Party Marxists] (LPM), which promotes many of the ideas of the ''Weekly Worker'' to a Labour Party audience through its website and occasional print bulletins. Stan Keable, secretary of Labour Party Marxists, was expelled from the Labour Party in June 2017 for his association with LPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1174/no-case-to-answer/|title=No case to answer - Weekly Worker|website=weeklyworker.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPGB (PCC) has also promoted the work of another Labour Party organisation, [http://www.labouragainstthewitchhunt.org/ Labour against the witch-hunt], in the ''Weekly Worker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1208/step-up-the-campaign/|title=Step up the campaign - Weekly Worker|website=weeklyworker.co.uk|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policies==
The party has been involved in a rethinking of the class nature of the former USSR. Despite its origins in the [[New Communist Party of Britain|NCP]], ''The Leninist'' advanced sharp criticisms of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern bloc]] countries, while strongly opposing movements it considered to be in support of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Conrad, ''From October to August'', November Publications 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Today, leading member Jack Conrad calls these societies forms of "bureaucratic socialism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conrad|first1=Jack|title=Marxism, nature, and proposition one|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/825/marxism-nature-and-proposition-one/|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=825|date=8 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813083817/http://www.cpgb.org.uk//article.php?article_id=1004005|archivedate=13 August 2011|quote=Socialism and communism do not raise the workers to the position where they own the planet and stand over it like a conqueror.

During the [[Kosovo War]] of the late 1990s, the party supported the ethnic-Albanian [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA) and supports the complete secession of [[Kosovo]] from [[Serbia]]. The party refers to the Serbian province as "Kosova", the Albanian and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] name for Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Independence for Kosova|url=http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/273/indkosova.html|accessdate=25 October 2015|work=Weekly Worker|issue=273|publisher=Conmmunist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)|date=28 January 1999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010307125745/http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/273/indkosova.html|archivedate=7 March 2001|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party lists abolition of age-of-consent laws among its immediate demands as well as alternative legislation to protect children from sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 3.

'''General elections''' were held in the [[Cook Islands]] on 20 April 1965 to elect 22 MPs to the [[Parliament of the Cook Islands|Cook Islands Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php |title=Voyage to Statehood |publisher=Cook Islands Government |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326003510/http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The elections were won by the [[Cook Islands Party]] and saw [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] become the Cook Islands' first [[Prime Minister of the Cook Islands|Prime Minister]].

Because the election had the potential to result in removing the Cook Islands from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], the election was observed by representatives of the UN. The holding of an election was necessary prior to the [[Constitution of the Cook Islands]] coming into force and the constitution, if approved by the elected Legislature, would institute self-government for the Cook Islands. After the election, the Legislative Assembly approved the constitution and the Cook Islands became self-governing on 4 August 1965. As a result, the UN removed the Cook Islands from its list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.

[[File:Sverigekarta-Landskap_Småland.svg|thumb|150px|A map of Småland.]]
The '''Dacke War''' ({{lang-sv|Dackefejden}}) was a [[peasant uprising]] led by [[Nils Dacke]] in [[Småland]], [[Sweden]], in 1542 against the rule of [[Gustav Vasa]]. Dacke and his followers were dissatisfied with the heavy tax burden, the introduction of [[Lutheranism]] and the confiscation of Church property (the confiscation and taxes were introduced to pay for the [[Swedish War of Liberation]] that had brought Gustav Vasa to power). In 1543 the uprising was defeated, and Nils Dacke was killed.

[[Image:Gustav Vasa triumphs 4.jpg|thumb|400px|The army of [[Gustav Vasa]] on its way to defeat [[Nils Dacke]].]]

== Background ==
{{See also|Early Vasa era}}

[[Nils Dacke]] and his peasants were dissatisfied with the policies of the Swedish king [[Gustav Vasa]]. In his effort to modernize Sweden and gain more power, the king had instituted a more efficient system for [[tax]] collection. The heavy tax burden angered many peasants.

Gustav Vasa had also broken relations with [[Rome]] and promoted [[Lutheranism]] instead of [[Catholicism]] in order to confiscate the property of the church (including land), effected by the laws of the [[Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden]]. In 1541 the king's men had confiscated many of the belongings of the churches in [[Småland]], such as the church silver and even the [[church bell]]s, to finance the army. Dacke criticized the new church order and promoted the old faith. He was also supported by many local [[priest]]s.

The rebellion was one of many rebellions during the rule of Gustav Vasa. In contrast with other contemporary rebellions in Sweden, this one was led by peasants, and not supported by the local [[nobility]].

== The uprising ==
The uprising began in the summer of 1542 when the king's [[bailiff]]s were attacked and killed when they came to collect taxes. Gustav Vasa responded by sending a military force led by his own father-in-law [[:sv:Gustaf Olofsson till Torpa|Gustav Olofsson Stenbock the Younger]]. He was defeated by Dacke's constantly growing army of peasants. Other attempts to defeat Dacke militarily also failed.

Next, the Swedish government stopped all supplies of provisions and other necessities to the region. This weakened the rebellions considerably. Defaming propaganda about Dacke was also spread by the government, labeling him a traitor and a heretic.

In March 1543 Gustav Vasa ordered his army of Swedish recruits and German [[landsknecht]] mercenaries to attack Småland. This time larger forces were deployed, and Dacke's forces were attacked from two directions - from [[Östergötland]] and [[Västergötland]]. The uprising was defeated, and Dacke was wounded but managed to flee.

== Aftermath ==
The king's revenge on the instigators of the rebellion was hard. The leaders that were caught were executed together with the priests who had supported Dacke. Peasants who had supported the rebellion were deported to [[Finland]], where they had to serve in the army, and the counties where the rebellion had taken place had to pay a large fine to the king.

Dacke himself was caught and killed in August 1543 when trying to escape the country. According to legend, his body was taken to [[Kalmar]], where his head was publicly displayed wearing a crown of copper, as a warning to others.

The rebellion was the most serious threat to the rule of Gustav Vasa, but after having defeated it he managed to consolidate his power, concentrating more and more power in the hands of the monarch.

== Idiom ==
In the Swedish language, the [[idiom]] &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;"[something]&lt;/span&gt; hasn't happened since the Dacke War" is used to mean "[something] hasn't happened for a long time". This expression is especially common in the southern parts of Sweden but is also used elsewhere.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Elmarbrandt.jpg|thumb|200px|Elmar Brandt with Gerhard Schröder puppet]] --&gt;
'''''Die Gerd-Show''''' ([[English language|en]]: '''''The Gerd Show''''') was a [[Germany|German]] [[satire|satirical]] radio show broadcast by [[Eins Live]] ([[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]). Reaching over nine million listeners at its peak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tax Song hits out|first=Eric|last=Culp|publisher=[[The Business (magazine)|The Business]]|date=17 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; it generated several Top 20 hits in the music charts in Germany, thanks to the [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] talents of its creator, [[Elmar Brandt]], as well as enough controversy over the show's good taste for it to receive newspaper coverage around the globe, despite the limited international appeal of German political humour.

==History==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Steuersong.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the ''Der Steuersong'' single]] --&gt;
The programme began in 1999, and was broadcast as a short daily comedy on various radio programmes. The most famous segments of these programmes were Elmar Brandt's rewrites of well-known tunes with new, satirical lyrics, which he sang in an imitation of the voice of [[Gerhard Schröder]], who at that time was [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]]. These parodies generated six hits in the Top 20 in Germany, and were also popular in Switzerland and Austria. 

The most successful of these was ''Der Steuersong'' (en: ''The Tax Song''), which reached the number one spot in Germany and Austria in 2002, and went double platinum in 2004, having sold over a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doppel-Platin für die «Gerd-Show» - «Steuer-Song» über eine Million Mal verkauft|publisher=ddp Landesdienste|date=8 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[Las Ketchup]]'s summer dance hit ''[[Aserejé]]'', the song lampooned Schröder's tax policy, listing a number of perceived absurd [[indirect tax]]es (such as an tax on [[dog]]s) and suggesting new ones on breathing and bad weather, and depicting the Chancellor as a cheat and a promise breaker. The song was accompanied by a video, in which an unflattering ''[[Spitting Image]]'' style puppet of Schröder stole coins from a charity collection tin, and medicine from the sick.&lt;ref name="Mocking"&gt;{{cite news|title=Song mocking Schröder tops German pop charts|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=20 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song generated political controversy. Reports suggested that Schröder might take legal action, as he notoriously did—successfully—to stop a news agency printing claims that he dyed his hair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder's good hair day in court|first=Toby|last=Helm|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a spokesman for Schröder's Social Democrats saying ''"There are limits even to political satire... We will take a look at the video, and the chancellor will have to examine what steps to take."''&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hit Song Taxes German's Patience; Parody Mocks Schroeder on Economy|first=Peter|last=Finn|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=17 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Schröder did not in the end take legal action, but did call Brandt a ''"parasite"'' and ''"freeloader"'' for building a career on someone else's voice, to which Brandt rebutted ''"Freeloaders usually attach themselves to people who are successful"''.&lt;ref name="Spars"&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder spars with comedian over spoof song|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=5 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' voiced indignation, asking ''"Can the chancellor be mocked like this?"'', though most thought that the song reflected genuine discontent with Schröder's tax policies and that Schröder took the song too seriously.&lt;ref name="Mocking"/&gt;

In 2003, Brandt took part in the German auditions for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]] with the song ''Alles wird gut'' (en: ''Everything's Going To Be Alright''). The act, which featured another puppet of Schröder simulating sex with the four backing singers, the "Gerdnerinnen" (Gerdettes, a word play on the German word for gardener), received 30% of the German vote, taking third place and losing out to [[Lou (singer)|Lou]]'s feel good anthem ''[[Let's Get Happy]]'' with 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder's blushes are spared as comic fails at Eurovision|first=Ruth|last=Elkins|publisher=[[The Independent on Sunday]]|date=9 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Die Vorzeichen sind wieder dieselben|first=Bibiana|last=Holzhey|publisher=General-Anzeiger|date=10 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005, [[Anne Onken]] imitated [[Angela Merkel]] on ''The Gerd Show'', who would later beat Schröder to become chancellor. During the run-up to the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 German federal elections]], a duet was released between Brandt as Schröder and Onken as Merkel, entitled ''Im Wahlkampf vor mir (Zonenmädchen)'' (en: ''Ahead of Me in the Polls (Girl from the East'')) and set to the tune of ''Im Wagen vor mir fährt ein junges Mädchen'' by [[Hans Blum (musician)|Hans Blum]]. Despite speculation that it would reach the top spot as ''Der Steuersong'' did before it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder ballad challenges Crazy Frog for No 1 spot|first=Roger|last=Boyes|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=8 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; it only reached 25th place in the German charts.

In October 2005, ''The Gerd Show'' was cancelled with 1,300 episodes. Its place was taken by the radio serial ''Schicksalsjahre einer Kanzlerin – Angela – eine Frau geht seinen Weg'' (en: ''A Female Chancellor's Years of Destiny – Angela – A Woman Follows His &lt;!-- ***NOTE***: 'Her' in German is 'ihren', 'his' is correct --&gt; Path'', alluding to the [[Sissi_–_Fateful_Years_of_an_Empress|Sissi film trilogy]]), with Angela Merkel played by Anne Onken, and her male colleagues played by Elmar Brandt.

The '''Feminist Art Program''' (FAP) was a college-level art program for women developed in 1970 by artist [[Judy Chicago]] and continued by artists Rita Yokoi, [[Miriam Schapiro]], and others. The FAP began at Fresno State College, as a way to address gender inequities in art education, and the art world in general. In 1971, [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]] brought the FAP to the newly formed [[California Institute of the Arts]], leaving Rita Yokoi to run the Fresno FAP until her retirement in 1992. The FAP at [[California Institute of the Arts]] was active until 1976. The students in the Feminist Art Program read women writers, studied women artists, and made art about being a woman based on group consciousness raising sessions. Often, the program was separate from the rest of the art school to allow the women to develop in a greenhouse-like environment and away from discerning critiques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the separatist ideology has been critiqued as reinforcing gender, the FAP has made a lasting impression on feminist art which can be seen in retrospectives, group exhibitions, and creative re-workings of the original projects.

== Fresno Feminist Art Program ==
The original Feminist Art Program was developed by artist [[Judy Chicago]]. The first such program was launched in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now [[California State University, Fresno]]. In the spring of 1971, It became a full 15-unit program. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"/&gt; Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art.

The Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as [[Womanhouse]], a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the California Institute of the Arts in the fall of 1971. [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville|Sheila de Bretteville]] and [[Arlene Raven]] also taught in that program. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art.&lt;ref name="Fresno1" /&gt;

After Chicago left for [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]], the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{#tag:ref|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] Gallery 25 with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}}

==Feminist Art Program (FAP) at CalArts==
Later, Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the Feminist Art Program (FAP) at [[California Institute of the Arts]].

The Feminist Art Program (FAP) was created by Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] at the California Institute of the Arts in [[Valencia, California]], in 1971. Building on the "radical educational techniques" that she had first tried out in her classes for women in 1970{{ndash}}1971, when she worked at Fresno State, Chicago and Schapiro made the program, the first of its kind accessible to women only. Chicago in particular felt she had to "redo" her education as an art historian, since she had been taught by men exclusively and considered that this background forced a male perspective on her as an artist and disallowed her from developing her "own forms, artistic language, and subject matter".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Paula|year=1985|title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=10|issue=4|pages=762–81|jstor=3174313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Studio Workshop==
The Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by Judy Chicago, [[Arlene Raven]], and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the [[Woman's Building]], the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39882">A '''fragile state''' is a [[developing country]] characterized by weak state capacity or weak state legitimacy leaving citizens vulnerable to a range of shocks. The World Bank, for example, deems a country to be ‘fragile’ if it (a) is eligible for assistance (i.e., a grant) from the International Development Association (IDA) (b) has had a UN peacekeeping mission in the last three years, and (c) has received a ‘governance’ score of less than 3.2 (as per the Country Performance and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index of The World Bank).

While many countries are making progress toward achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], a group of 35 to 50 countries (depending on the measure used) are falling behind. It is estimated that out of the world's seven billion people, 26% live in fragile states, and this is where one-third of all people surviving on less than US$1.25 per day live, half of the world's children who die before the age of five, and one-third of maternal deaths occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20153855~menuPK:435040~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis|author=World Bank|accessdate=2009-01-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125125850/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0%2C%2CcontentMDK%3A20153855~menuPK%3A435040~pagePK%3A148956~piPK%3A216618~theSitePK%3A430367%2C00.html|archivedate=2009-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only are they falling behind, but the gap with other developing countries is widening since the 1970s. In 2006, per capita [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] grew only at 2% in fragile states, whereas it reached 6% in other low-income countries. Projections (for example, World Bank, 2008) that fragile states will constitute an even larger share of low-income countries in the future given that many better performing low-income countries graduate to middle-income status. This is a major challenge for development efforts and it has been argued by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] that fragile states require fundamentally different approaches from the development models exercised in more resilient countries, because of the different context of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manuel|first=Marcus|title=Getting better results from assistance to fragile states|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5961&amp;title=budget-strengthening-fragile-states-conflict-g7|work=ODI Briefing Papers|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common measure of state fragility is to use the World Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment index,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IQ.CPA.PUBS.XQ/countries|title= Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Index|author=World Bank|accessdate=2015-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but more complex indexes, for example including the security dimension, are increasingly being used.

==Definition==
Country contexts vary widely in this group of countries ranging from Haiti to Nepal, from Uzbekistan to Burundi. Some are trapped in a vicious cycle of violent conflict and poverty or suffer from a natural resource "curse"; others face a legacy of poor [[governance]]; many emerging from crisis cannot deliver even the most basic services to their citizens, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo. In terms of dynamics, fragile states include:

* post-conflict/crisis or political transition situations 
* deteriorating [[governance]]  environments
* situations of gradual improvement and
* situations of prolonged crisis or impasse

A fragile state is significantly susceptible to [[crisis]] in one or more of its sub-systems. It is a state that is particularly vulnerable to internal and external shocks and domestic and international conflicts. In a fragile state, institutional arrangements embody and perhaps preserve the conditions of crisis: in [[economics|economic]] terms, this could be institutions (importantly, [[property right]]s) that reinforce stagnation or low [[Economic growth|growth rates]], or embody extreme inequality (in wealth, in access to property and land ownership, in access to the means to make a living); in social terms institutions may embody extreme inequality or lack of access altogether to health or education; in political terms, institutions may entrench exclusionary coalitions in power (in ethnic, religious, or perhaps regional terms), or extreme factionalism or significantly fragmented security organisations. In fragile states, statutory institutional arrangements are vulnerable to challenges by rival institutional systems be they derived from traditional authorities, devised by communities under conditions of stress that see little of the state (in terms of security, development or welfare), or be they derived from [[warlord]]s, or other non-state power brokers.

The opposite of a "fragile state" is a "stable state"{{snd}} one where dominant or statutory institutional arrangements appear able to withstand internal and external shocks and contestation remains within the boundaries of reigning institutional arrangements. With the right conditions, some countries{{snd}} such as Mozambique and Burundi{{snd}} have so far demonstrated a remarkable turn-around. To address the challenge of these countries falling behind, the international spotlight must be kept on countries where the [[Millennium Development Goals]] are hardest to achieve, using common principles for action; making the international aid architecture more rational; improving the organisational response of the wide range of actors involved (including "the 3Ds": diplomacy, defense and development); and measuring results.

While there are no universal criteria to determine state fragility, the World Bank, through its LICUS programme (Low Income Countries Under Stress) and its Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Index, has been able to establish a preeminent frame of reference for donor countries and other institutional partners. Based on four clusters (including economic management, structural policies, policies for social inclusion/equity and Public Sector Management and institutions) as well as 16 indicators, the CPIA index rates state performance, with those countries scoring under 3.2 out of a total of 6 qualifying as "fragile". Such low performing countries may then be, in turn, suitable for the allocation of financial assistance from a variety of international actors such as the International Development Association and other, similar bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IQ.CPA.PUBS.XQ/countries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nay, Olivier. "International Organisations and the Production of Hegemonic Knowledge: How the World Bank and The helped Invent the Fragile State Concept." Third World Quarterly 35.2 (2014): 210–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of the term and discussion===
Fragile states, similar to failed, weak or collapsed states, is an analytical category that gained prominence from the mid 1990s onwards and gained further traction after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Background is the belief held by many policy-makers and academics alike that the potential for contemporary conflict is harboured within, not between, states. Low capacity and low-income states of the Global South are thought to pose direct threats not only to their own populations, but by extension also to their neighboring Western countries. Following this logic, fragile states are in need of development in order to be able to provide security and basic services to its citizens, decreasing vulnerability and increasing resilience to internal and external shocks.

Followed by many donor countries and international organisations and institutions, this approach has led to a spirited debate within academia and beyond. While on the one hand, some scholars deem the categorisation of states as fragile as useful, highlighting the potential to predict state collapse and assess the many possibilities to prevent it, a more critical-minded literature disputes this. Two main criticisms emerge, challenging on one side the potential of abuse of the category of state fragility, legitimising external intervention at the expense of the local agency. On the other, the analytical utility of the categorization effort itself is disputed; the state-centric grouping together of a wide range of diverse countries leads to highly standardised development responses that cannot take into account often highly divergent political, economic and social conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nay Olivier.

* Massive internal and external displacement of refugees, creating severe [[humanitarian crisis|humanitarian emergencies]].
* Widespread vengeance-seeking group grievances.
* Chronic and sustained [[emigration|human flight]].

===Economic===
* Widespread [[corruption]]
* High [[economic inequality]]
* Uneven economic development along group lines.
* Severe economic decline.

===Political===
* Delegitimization of the state.
* Deterioration of public services.

* [[Security forces]] operating as a "[[state within a state]]" often with impunity.
* Rise of factionalized elites.
* Intervention of external political agents and foreign states.

==Intergovernmental organisations==
Fragile states and post-conflict countries have participated in many intergovernmental groups and associations since the [[Second World War]], including the [[Group of 77]] and regional groups such as [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] and the [[African Union]]. However until recently countries affected by conflict had no dedicated international platform. In 2010 the [[g7+]] was founded by a group of post-conflict countries to better represent their interests on the international stage. The g7+ is an intergovernmental organisation bringing together countries that have recent experience of conflict. The group aims to draw attention to the special challenges faced by fragile states, provides a platform for conflict-affected countries to come together to discuss their shared development challenges, and advocates for better international policies to address the needs of conflict-affected countries. The g7+ has embarked on its very own index for measuring state fragility, identifying five clusters (political legitimacy, justice, security, economic foundation, revenue and services), which are located on a fragility- ”spectrum” containing five stages. Main differences to other indices are constituted by privileged role of individual, state-specific characteristics and self- rather than external assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Siqueira, Isabel Rocha De. "Measuring and Managing ‘state Fragility’: The Production of Statistics by the World Bank, Timor-Leste and the G7." Third World Quarterly 35.2 (2014): 268-83&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 20 member countries: Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Liberia, Papua New Guinea, São Tomé e Príncipe, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Solomon Islands, South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo and Yemen. [[Sierra Leone]]'s Minister of Finance and Development, Dr [[Kaifala Marah]], is the current Chair, taking over the role in May 2014. The role of Chair was previously held by Minister Emilia Pires of Timor-Leste who oversaw the development of the forum in its earliest years. The g7+ Secretariat was established in 2010 and is based in Dili, Timor-Leste.

== Origins  ==

=== Lack of Social Control ===

Though governments for most of the countries seem to be functioning well and representing their people on the world stage, [[Joel S. Migdal|Joel Migdal]] looked into the relationship between state and society, where there is a disparity between the officially announced policies and the actual distribution of state resources. The list of countries included [[India]], [[Mexico]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sierra Leone]] etc. He traced this disparity to the lack of social control by the government - “the actual ability to make the operative rules of the game for people in the society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societes and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=261|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; This not only includes existence of government agencies over the territory and extraction of resources but also the ability to appropriate resources and to regulate people's behavior.

Migdal stated the expansion of European economy and world trade in the 19th century led to drastic changes in people's strategies of survival in countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societes and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=57–84|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt; State policies enforced by Europeans, including land tenure laws, taxation and new modes of transportation, changed people's life situation and needs in these countries rapidly and deeply.  Old rewards, sanctions and symbols became irrelevant under the new situation and previous social control and institutions were eroded.

However, unlike western Europe in the earlier centuries, these countries did not establish a new concentration of social control as the base of a strong and capable state. This is because although these countries had the necessary condition for creating a strong state - old social control weakened by the world trade before [[World War I]] - they did not have the sufficient conditions: 1) world historical timing that encourages concentrated social control; 2) military threat either from outside or within the country; 3) the basis for an independent bureaucracy; 4) skillful top leadership that would take advantage of all the above conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/876100982|title=Strong societes and weak states : state-society relations and state capabilities in the third world|last=Migdal|first=Joel S.|date=1988|publisher=Princeton University press|year=|isbn=9780691010731|location=|pages=269–275|oclc=876100982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic services provision==
There is a relationship between state fragility and [[Social security|service delivery]] and they are both seen as interrelated and mutually reinforcing, yet some also suggest that the provision of basic services can reduce state fragility.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Sara Pavanello and James Darcy (2008) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2758&amp;title=provision-basic-services-poor-fragile-environments-synthesis Improving the provision of basic services for the poor in fragile environments: International Literature Review Synthesis Paper] [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; In fragile states service delivery may be impacted by financial constraints, limited expertise and a lack of information&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Long and protracted violence leads to the neglect and subsequent decay of the infrastructure required for provision.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Governance and the breakdown of social order can also heighten the [[social exclusion]] of specific groups along ethnic, religious, political and gender lines.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Such violence can be political, including conflict and terrorism, but can also be social or criminal, leading to a broad combination of security-based obstacles to effective service provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Alexandra|title=Violence in Yemen: Thinking About Violence in Fragile States Beyond the Confines of Conflict and Terrorism|journal=Stability: International Journal of Security and Development|date=14 May 2013|volume=2|issue=1|url=http://www.stabilityjournal.org/article/view/sta.az/56|doi=10.5334/sta_az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education, health, access to water and adequate sanitation are important not only for survival, but are also recognised [[International human rights|human rights]] whose provision is demonstrated to be necessary for a transition away from conflict.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; States can develop trust and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] over the long term through the provision of these basic services (known as the "[[peace dividend]]").&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; [[Education]], for instance, can protect children and non-combatants during conflict, facilitate intergenerational change and lead to the [[socialisation]] of children and youth, be a catalyst for broader transformation, as well as provide a sense of normalcy and continuity.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Furthermore, the delivery of some of these services can be seen as more neutral, such as immunisation, and can lead to conflicting groups uniting on specific issues and further result in increased legitimacy.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

However, how support is given to fragile states to provide these services is not so simple.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; Aid agencies who act independently of the state and provide parallel services risk undermining state legitimacy and capacity.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt; On the other hand, supporting the state's own provision can be problematic as the state itself may be the cause of social divisions and a source of conflict.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

Limited evidence of varying quality on basic services and [[social protection]] in conflicted affected situations has been found. Research into the gaps in provision, delivery and access of basic services has queried whether social protection interventions have contributed to state-building processes. It highlighted that this assumption has already significantly begun shaping policy and programmes and that state-building outcomes in policy may outweigh other outcomes like better water, healthcare and education.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, R. Mallett, R. and Carpenter, October 2012, Social protection and basic services in fragile and conflict-affected situations, Researching livelihoods and 
services affected by conflict http://www.securelivelihoods.org/publications_details.aspx?ResourceID=145&lt;/ref&gt;

==State building and peacebuilding==
Whether or not to provide services in parallel is often framed as a debate between [[state building]] and peacebuilding.&lt;ref name=ODI3&gt;Alina Rocha Menocal (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3673&amp;title=fragile-state-building-peace-conflict 'State-building for peace': navigating an arena of contradictions], [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; State building is argued to lead to peace when it involves seeking to develop an inclusive state, where legitimacy is built as the result of the state responding to the demands of all of society and providing [[public goods]] and [[Public services|services]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; However, supporting the state in this direction is not a simple task, especially for the following reasons:&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

* State-building may not automatically lead to peace as it is an inherently political process and will not automatically be inclusive or democratic. 
* [[Political settlement]]s that seek to appease those that threaten peace can strengthen the rule of repressive rulers.
* [[Political settlement]]s that create power sharing agreements can weaken the state and lead to further entrenching divides.
* Focussing on state institutions may lead to overlooking domestic non-state actors, including traditional local leaders, and prevent the long term of a [[civil society]].

Equally, peacebuilding efforts that do not include the state can undermine its ability to function.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] emphasise the need for NGOs and other development actors to deepen knowledge of the context and maintain a constant awareness of the relationship between state- and peace-building.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

===Case study: Sierra Leone===
The correct balance of [[state-building]] and peacebuilding has been argued to be highly elusive, even when peacebuilding and security have been achieved through the development of the state's own capacity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Vicki Metcalfe, Ellen Martin and Sara Pantuliano 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5415&amp;title=stability-humanitarian-action-security-development-fragile-states Risk in humanitarian action: towards a common approach?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UK]] government supported reforms in [[Sierra Leone]] along the principle of "security first" over the last decade, which is believed to have improved security, increased access to and the quality of justice, decreased corruption and positively reformed public service.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Since the end of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war in 2002]], there has been no major violence, [[Sierra Leone election, 2007|peaceful elections]] were held in 2007 and there has been enough stability to help build sustainable institutions.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Yet Sierra Leone suffers severe underdevelopment and ranked third to last on the [[UN Human Development Index]] for 2010. This in turn has created frustration and disappointment amongst the younger generation and poses a significant risk of a return to violence.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

=== International intervention or autonomous recovery ===
Debates have been among scholars if post-conflict reconstruction intervention is the best strategy for state-building in fragile states. It is widely believed that [[Interventionism (politics)|multilateral intervention]] can interrupt the conflict trap of fragile states and set countries on a path toward postwar economic and political development. Responding to the failure of governance in fragile states, scholars have proposed new models of intervention, including neo-trusteeship and [[Sovereignty|shared sovereignty]]. Supporters of International intervention encourage interventions led by the major powers or regional actors with the greatest national security or economic interest in restoring stability and democracy to the fragile state. They support developing agreements that authorize international intervention whereby the costs of third-party peacekeeping and state-building would increasingly be borne by the state being reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon, James D, and David D Laitin|first=|date=2004|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States.|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/0162288041588296|journal=International Security|volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another kind of opinion has been the autonomous recovery - fragile states can recover from a conflict in the absence of intervention and may be able to develop effective institutions of government out of warfare. Supporters of autonomous recovery argue that international assistance and external support undermines the self-sustaining nature of the compact between rulers and constituents. Examples of [[Uganda]], [[Eritrean War of Independence|Eritrea]], and [[Somali Civil War|Somalia]] support the theory of autonomous recovery, where these weak states successfully achieved a lasting peace, a systematic reduction in violence, and post-war political and economic development in the absence of international intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgdev.org/publication/autonomous-recovery-and-international-intervention-comparative-perspective-working-paper|title=Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective - Working Paper 57|work=Center For Global Development|access-date=2017-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Promoting Democracy ===
According to Samuel Huntington,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Order in Changing Societies|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1973|isbn=0-300-01171-7|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The most important political distinction among countries concerns, not their form of government but their degree of government.” The purpose of democratization and institutional development in fragile states is to help them improve both [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft5g50071k&amp;chunk.id=d0e3492&amp;toc.depth=100&amp;brand=ucpress state capacity] and development of inclusive institutions. Knutsen and Nygard (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knutsen|first=Carl|last2=Nygard|first2=Havard|date=July 2015|title=Institutional Characteristics and Regime Survival: Why Are Semi-Democracies Less Durable Than Autocracies and Democracies?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12168/full|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=59|issue=3|pages=656–670|doi=10.1111/ajps.12168}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize that semi-democracies (fragile states in our discussion) are less stable than both autocracies and democracies. In other words, once the process of [[democratization]] begins, it is dangerous to stop midway.

The purpose of [[democratization]] itself though is of concern before thinking about the means to achieve it. Ake (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feasibility of Democracy in Africa|last=Ake|first=Claude|publisher=Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa|year=2000|isbn=2-86978-093-1|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; says that democracy has mostly been analyzed in the context of its propensity to foster economic development. But in the context of its feasibility in Africa, the utility of democracy as measured by the “values, concerns and priorities of African peoples”, will determine to a considerable extent how far they will accept democracy. In general, the process of democratization is strongly mediated by [[Normative|normative values]] of the population of concern.

In order to design interventions aimed at promoting inclusive institutions when the status quo witnesses prevalently weak state structures, tractability of theoretically analyzing regime transitions is critical. But according to Geddes (1999),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geddes|first=Barbara|date=1999|title=What Do We Know About Democratization After Twenty Years?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=2|issue=1|pages=115–144|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.2.1.115}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is because different kinds of [[authoritarianism]] differ from each other as much they differ from democracy. To facilitate the analysis of these differences, she classifies authoritarian regimes as 'personalist', military, single-party, or amalgams of the pure types. It is important to note that all of them can be conceptualized from the perspective of “Limited Access Order” societies (North 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-4359|title=Limited Access Orders In The Developing World :A New Approach To The Problems Of Development|last=North|first=Douglass C. Wallis, John Joseph Webb, Steven B. Weingast, Barry R.|date=2007-11-09|publisher=The World Bank|series=Policy Research Working Papers|doi=10.1596/1813-9450-4359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [https://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/papers/PromotingDemocracy0905.htm Larry Diamond], in many of the fragile states promoting democracy is difficult simply because they lack the classic facilitating conditions for democracy—more developed levels of per capita income, civil society, independent mass media, political parties, mass democratic attitudes and values, and so on—but because they lack as well the more basic conditions of a viable political order. In these states, the challenge is not only (or in some cases, even at all) to pressure authoritarian state leaders to surrender power but rather to figure out how to regenerate legitimate power in the first place.  The imperative is not only to empower citizens and their independent organizations but to endow state institutions as well with resources, training, organization, and a sense of a common mission.

One point of caution is that progress in democratization in fragile states are vulnerable. According to Samuels (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Comparative_Politics.html?id=tGnOygAACAAJ|title=Comparative Politics|last=Samuels|first=David|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780321449740|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; history has witnessed [[regime change]]s from democracy to autocracy during the periods of 1925-1945 [e.g. Germany (1933) ] and 1960-1974 [e.g. Brazil (1964), Chile (1973)]. What he identifies as domestic causes of regime change are also the factors to be mitigated through [[Institution|institutional design]]. Some of these factors are civic culture, class conflicts arising from the unequal distribution of economic gains and military identity. Some of the international causes are the foreign policy of superpowers, the degree of participation in multilateral institutions, the extent of globalization and supranational impact of religious institutions on domestic political institutions.

==Non-state actors==
Individuals in fragile states often rely on [[non-state actors]] such as chiefs, tribal elders, secret societies, gangs, militias, insurgents or religious leaders to meet their justice and security needs. Lisa Denney, of the [[Overseas Development Institute]], therefore stresses the need for development donors to engage with these non-state actors when attempting to reform justice and security services in fragile states.&lt;ref&gt;Denney, L. (2012) Non-state security and justice in fragile states: Lessons from Sierra Leone. Overseas Development Institute Briefing Paper http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7640.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests four rules of engagement:

# Accept that non-state actors are risky, but no more than many state partners 
# Be fit for purpose &amp;ndash; non-state support needs different skills and procedures 
# Understand context 
# Only engage when it adds value

==Private sector development==
Researchers found little evidence in literature on the impact of [[private sector development]] on state society relations and whether  PSD and state relations meet public expectations. They thought one reason could be the lack of empirical data gathered from interviews and public surveys on the ground. The interlinkage of PSD on state society relations therefore definitely remain an area for further exploration and should receive greater attention in academic circles and among practitioners in respective publications.&lt;ref name="partnerplatform.org"&gt;Simone Datzberger and Mike Denison, [http://www.partnerplatform.org/?w7g496qv Private Sector Development in Fragile States], September 2013, ECONOMIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PROFESSIONAL EVIDENCE AND APPLIED KNOWLEDGE SERVICES&lt;/ref&gt; Key findings include:&lt;ref name="partnerplatform.org"/&gt;

* Legal reform requirements in fragile states' legal frameworks to boost Private sector Development are underestimated and deserve greater attention in development assistance. However, law-making is a long-term process and shouldn't violate tenets of representation and legitimacy.
* Although connections between economic growth and infrastructure are well established in literature, infrastructure project impact assessments that look beyond the first few years after a project are rare.
* Apart from the success in Cambodia the importance of instituting a solid labour rights regime in fragile states needs to be further explored. It's a balancing act to create labour rights and protect workers while maintaining flexibility to bring efficient levels of employment to foster PSD and for business.
* Microfinance isn't a one-stop solution to poverty reduction and depends on the fragile state in question.
* CSR interventions can potentially do more harm than good and should not substitute government services or any other forms of development assistance.
* Lack of access to capital to launch business and a dearth of local financial institutions like reliable central banks remain a major constraints to PSD especially in sub-Saharan African fragile states.
* The literature reveals a mixed picture of the effects of [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] on conflict and stability as success relies on context and environment.

== Relationships with other factors ==

===Economic performance===
A 2012 study by EPS-PEAKS investigated the relationship between state fragility, [[conflict (process)|conflict]] and economic performance.&lt;ref&gt;Holden, J. and Pagel, J. (2012) [http://partnerplatform.org/?0t40vy3t Fragile states' economices: What does fragility mean for economic performance?] [http://partnerplatform.org/eps-peaks EPS-PEAKS] query response.&lt;/ref&gt; It describes a large degree of variation among countries' experiences of conflict and [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI), with conflict accompanied by high levels of FDI in some countries and low levels of FDI in others. The study suggests that the majority of FDI in fragile states is driven by the motives of resource-seeking multinationals. While this investment can lead to economic growth, this potential is often not realised, and receiving investment solely for resource extraction can lead to further conflict: a phenomenon known as the [[resource curse]].

If a state cannot tax reasonably or spend responsibly a key element of statehood is missing, claim researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[World Bank]]. They explain that substantial progress can be made in [[public financial management]] in fragile states, with most progress made on budget execution, though critical gaps remain in knowledge of the relationship between PFM, [[Sovereign state|statehood]] and [[economic development|development]] progress.&lt;ref&gt;Hedger, E.
Krause, P. and Tavakoli, H. [http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7840.pdf Public financial management reform in fragile states: Grounds for cautious optimism?] ODI briefing paper 77, October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important economic component for failed states is reintegrating ex-fighters into society and the economy. Blattman and Annan conducted a study on how employment reduced risk of returning to violence for high-risk men after the Second Liberian [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil]] War.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blattman1 Annan2|first=Christopher1 Jeannie2|date=2015|title="Can Employment Reduce Lawlessness and Rebellion? A Field Experiment with High-Risk Men in a Fragile State"|ssrn=2431293|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=110|pages=1–17|doi=10.1017/s0003055415000520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was on a program that provided agricultural training and capital inputs to the ex-fighters who still own rubber plantations or participated in illicit mining for precious minerals or logging. They found that the men responded well to agricultural training, reduced their illicit extraction of materials by roughly 20%, and about a quarter were less likely to be willing to fight in the election crisis in Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the illicit activity did not stop completely. They also found that a promise of future returns was crucial in deterring men from fighting.

=== Climate change ===
A 2015 study, commissioned by the [[Group of Seven|G7]] member states, identifies seven climate-fragility risks that pose threats to the stability of states and societies in the decades ahead.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Climate For Peace|last=Rüttinger, Lukas; Gerald Stang, Dan Smith, Dennis Tänzler, Janani Vivekananda et al.|first=|publisher=adelphi, International Alert, The Wilson Center, EUISS.|year=2015|isbn=|location=Berlin/London/ Washington/Paris|pages=109|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report finds that in fragile regions, where inequality persists and the government is unable to respond to stresses, the impacts of [[Global warming|climate change]] on water, food and land will multiply existing pressures. It suggests that dynamics of state fragility, social and political fragility, may be exacerbated by climate change impacts and that the consequence of this is reduced [[Climate change adaptation|adaptation]] capacity. A downward spiral of fragility or 'vicious climate-fragility cycle' begins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The report also describes how one can measure the capacity of states and societies to meet the challenges of environmental change along a 'spectrum of fragility', from 'most fragile' to 'most [[Resilience (organizational)|resilient]]'. In fragile situations, where the government lacks ability to carry out basic functions, the state is more vulnerable to and less able to cope with climate change pressures such as natural resource scarcity, land use change, extreme weather events or volatile food prices, and hence more at risk from further instability.

'''Gerald Burton Winrod''' (March 7, 1900 – November 11, 1957) was a pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]], author, and political activist.&lt;ref name=adl/&gt; He was charged with [[sedition]] during [[World War II]].

==Biography==
He was born on March 7, 1900 to Mable E. (1881–1971), originally from Illinois, and John W. Winrod (1873–1945), originally from Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Winrod in the [[1910 US census]] living in [[Wichita, Kansas]]&lt;/ref&gt;
His father, John, was a former bartender whose saloon was attacked by [[Carrie Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Juhnke|first=James C.|year=1975|title=A People of Two Kingdoms: the Political Acculturation of the Kansas Mennonites|publisher=Faith and Life Press|isbn=0-87303-662-X|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 he was the chief clerk at the Kansas Gas and Electric Company in [[El Dorado, Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[World War I]] draft registration; September 12, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 he formed the [[Defenders of the Faith (Puerto Rico)|Defenders of the Christian Faith]], a [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] organization that opposed teaching [[evolution]] in public schools and supported [[Prohibition]] and [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1939_1940_4_YRUS.pdf ''American Jewish Yearbook'', covering the period from July 1, 1938 to June 30, 1939, pg. 216]&lt;/ref&gt;

Winrod professed strongly [[Anti-Semitism|antisemitic]] views, earning him the nickname "The [[wikt:Jayhawk|Jayhawk]] [[Nazism|Nazi]]" ("Jayhawk" being a nickname for a [[Kansas|Kansan]]). Winrod offered the following defense of his views in the introduction to his book ''The Truth About the Protocols'' which proclaimed the veracity of ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'': "After observing the title of this book, some will accuse me of being anti-Semitic. If by this they mean that I am opposed to the Jews as a race or as a religion, I deny the allegation. But if they mean that I am opposed to a coterie of international Jewish bankers ruling the Gentile world by the power of gold, if they mean that I am opposed to international Jewish Communism, then I plead guilty to the charge." Winrod believed the United States to be the chosen land of [[God]] and, when the [[Great Depression]] struck, publicly stated that it was the work of [[Satan]]. He believed [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was a "devil" linked with the [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish-Communist conspiracy]] and that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] would save Europe from [[Communism]].&lt;ref name="Juhnke, p. 138"&gt;Juhnke, pg. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

Winrod spread these views through his newspaper, ''The Defender'', which by 1937 achieved a 100,000 monthly circulation.&lt;ref name="Juhnke, p. 139"&gt;Juhnke, pg. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the articles reproduced materials from the pro-[[Nazi]] and virulently [[antisemitic]] international [[Ulrich Fleischhauer|''Welt-Dienst''/''World-Service''/''Service Mondial'']] [[news agency]] founded in 1933 by [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]].

Winrod ran for a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat from Kansas in the [[United States Senate elections, 1938|1938 elections]], but was defeated in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[primary election|primary]] when a popular former [[governor of Kansas|governor]], [[Clyde M. Reed]], was lured out of retirement by the party establishment to run against him. With 21.4% of the vote, Winrod was a distant third after Reed and Dallas Knapp of [[Coffeyville, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Juhnke, p. 140"&gt;Juhnke, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winrod developed a strong following among [[German language|German]]-speaking Kansas [[Mennonite]]s who identified with his religious, anti-World War II, and pro-Germany views. ''The Defender'' was printed by Mennonite-owned Herald Publishing Company of [[Newton, Kansas]] from 1931-42.&lt;ref name="Juhnke, p. 139"/&gt; Winrod found support in [[Bethel College (Kansas)|Bethel College]] and [[Tabor College, Kansas|Tabor College]]&lt;ref name="Juhnke, p. 138"/&gt; and from editors of local Mennonite papers, and some Mennonite precincts voted predominantly for Winrod in the 1938 Senate primary.&lt;ref name="Juhnke, p. 140"/&gt;

According to the 1941 ''Theologue'', the yearbook of Practical Bible Training School (now [[Davis College (New York)|Davis College]]) located just outside [[Binghamton, New York]], Winrod was a member of the school's administration. No details are given as to what Winrod's duties were. In 1942 the federal government indicted Winrod for [[sedition]], alleging conspiracy against the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="Juhnke, p. 140"/&gt; The political aspect in attempting to suppress [[free speech]] troubled [[civil libertarians]] in what critics derided as the [[Smith Act#Washington 1944|Great Sedition Trial]]. The death of the judge ended the trial in 1944. The government decided not to renew the prosecution, so Winrod and his fellow defendants were freed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

He died on November 11, 1957 in [[Wichita, Kansas]] of [[pneumonia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=November 13, 1957|title=Gerald B. Winrod, Wichita Minister.

The '''Haldane Reforms''' were a series of far-ranging reforms of the [[British Army]] made from 1906 to 1912, and named after the [[Secretary of State for War]], [[Richard Burdon Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|Richard Burdon Haldane]]. They were the first major reforms since the "[[Childers Reforms]]" of the early 1880s, and were made in the light of lessons newly learned in the [[Second Boer War]].

The major element of the reforms was the creation of an [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]], specifically prepared and trained for intervening in a major war. This had existed before, but it had not been well-prepared for overseas service, and the newly organised force would have a permanent peacetime organisation and a full complement of supporting troops. At the same time, the reserve forces were restructured and expanded to ensure that the overseas forces could be efficiently reinforced and supplied with new recruits. To ensure that home defence would not suffer from sending the regular forces overseas, the Militia formed the [[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]] and the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Volunteer Force]] and the [[Yeomanry]] were reorganised into a new [[Territorial Force]]; these latter two reforms were grouped together in the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]]. To encourage the development of military skills, an [[Officer Training Corps]] was established in [[Public school (UK)|public schools]] and universities. Military strategy was revitalised by a new [[Imperial General Staff]], which would ensure a common doctrine and common strategic aims among the various military forces of the [[British Empire]], including the [[British Dominions|Dominions]] as well as [[British India]]. Finally, the Regular Army itself would be reformed by the development of a new operational and training doctrine, laid down in [[Douglas Haig|Douglas Haig's]] new ''Field Service Pocket Book''.

The outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August 1914 saw the bulk of the changes put to the test; the Expeditionary Force was quickly sent to the Continent, whilst the Territorial Force and Reserves were mobilised as planned to provide a second line.

==Background==
{{Main|Cardwell Reforms|Childers Reforms|Esher Report}}

In the middle of the 19th century, the British Army had seen two major operations in close succession - the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Indian Mutiny]] - and it had become apparent that the existing organisation of the forces was not sufficient for large-scale modern warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of reforms was from 1858 to 1860. This period saw the creation of the [[Staff College]], which helped to turn officers in the upper reaches of the Army into professional soldiers; the transformation of the old [[East India Company]] army into the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] to better control the forces in India; and the creation of the [[Volunteer Force]] to help with home defence whilst the [[Regular Army]] was overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, pp. 216-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The second wave was from 1868 to 1872, comprising a collection of administrative changes popularly known as the "[[Cardwell Reforms]]" after the then Secretary of State for War, [[Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell|Edward Cardwell]]. The [[purchase of commissions]] by officers was abolished, and recruits were now taken on for a short enlistment in a specified [[regiment]] or corps rather than the (unpopular) system of twenty-one-year general service enlistments. These measures at a stroke increased the quality of the manpower of the Army, and provided for a trained and efficient reserve of veterans which could be recalled to the [[Colours, standards and guidons|colours]] in an emergency. A further part of the reforms was the reorganisation of the regimental system, linking "territorial" (line) regiments in paired regimental depots with a territory based recruiting area for simplified recruitment and training.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, pp. 217-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The third set of reforms was the "[[Childers Reforms]]" (again named after the Secretary of State who carried them out) of the early 1880s, which carried through the Cardwell regimental reorganisations to their logical end by completing the amalgamation of linked regiments into single two-battalion regiments along with the local units of militia and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of these reforms was to provide a sizable, well-trained force in the British Isles, which could be sent overseas in time of crisis, with a system of [[reservist]]s and home-service volunteers to support it. However, with the outbreak of the [[South African War]] in October 1899, the system immediately began to show some strain; by the end of the first year of fighting, the reserves had been entirely exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; Various novel measures, including the extensive use of auxiliary forces, were experimented with for the remainder of the war; the Militia provided garrison units to free up regulars,&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 90-1&lt;/ref&gt; the Volunteers sent service companies to be attached to regular battalions,&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 97-102&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Imperial Yeomanry]] was created to supply much-needed mounted infantry.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 104-8&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of half-hearted attempts were made at reform during the war and in its immediate aftermath, but with little effect. Two important [[Royal Commission]]s were established in 1902 - the Esher Committee and the Norfolk Commission&lt;ref&gt;named after the [[Duke of Norfolk]]&lt;/ref&gt; - and reported in 1904. The [[Esher Report]] called for wide-ranging reforms in the administration of the Army and the War Office, whilst the Norfolk Commission, which had studied the auxiliary forces, declared them "unfit for service" and recommended various practical reforms alongside the much more sensational suggestion of [[universal military service]].&lt;ref name="Sheppard, p. 292"&gt;Sheppard, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reforms were instituted under the Conservative Secretary of State for War, [[Hugh Arnold-Forster]], in 1904-5, but the broad thrust of his reform plans were strongly opposed.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 179-83, 193-4&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to reorganise the home forces into six Army Corps had begun, but only one of these had actually been organised,&lt;ref name="Sheppard, p. 292"/&gt; and even that lacked many of its support units and staff.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 158-60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haldane's reforms==

In December 1905, the [[Arthur Balfour|Balfour]] government collapsed, and Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] became Prime Minister, leading a [[minority government|minority]] [[Liberal Party (United Kingdom)|Liberal]] government. [[Richard Haldane]] was appointed Secretary of State for War, an almost accidental selection &amp;mdash; he himself had been aiming to be [[Lord Chancellor]], whilst Campbell-Bannerman offered him the post of [[Attorney-General]], then the [[Home Office]], and had offered the [[War Office]] to two other men before Haldane offered to take it. Despite this inauspicious beginning, he would become, in the words of [[Douglas Haig]], "the greatest Secretary of State for War England has ever had".&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 231-2&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane took the post with well hidden preconceived ideas as to the role of the Army having realised that the reform-weary Generals in the War Office, after [[St John Brodrick]], would not want another Secretary of State for War who was intent on changing things yet again.  Haldane's success was that he got the Generals on side having gained their trust and respect, then expunged the War Office of those officers who did not support his reforms and with the support of Lord Esher, Maj Gen Haig and Colonel Ellison, finally designed and implemented a set of reforms that would go some way to preparing the British Army for the opening salvos of the First World War.

===Creation of an Expeditionary Force===
{{main|British Expeditionary Force (World War I)}}

[[Image:4th Bn Royal Fusiliers 22 August 1914.jpg|thumb|left|The Expeditionary Force on service: men of 4th/[[Royal Fusiliers]] resting before the [[Battle of Mons]], August 22, 1914]]
After a brief hiatus during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|1906 general election]], which the Liberals won by a landslide, obtaining a majority of 126 seats in the House of Commons, Haldane turned his attention to the [[First Moroccan Crisis|Tangier Crisis]], which had almost brought [[France]] and [[Germany]] to war in December. Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France, if attacked, and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 236-41&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]], specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; The question now became how to provide this force, and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units. They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom, as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Army was now geared to a specific purpose, it could be reorganised to fit this role; any elements which did not fit could be discarded to help pay for the changes;&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; this was to include the disbandment of ten infantry battalions and a number of surplus artillery batteries, and the withdrawal of some overseas garrisons.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 255-257. The disbanded battalions would be the 3rd Battalions of the [[Coldstream Guards]] and 3rd [[Scots Guards]], and the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the [[Northumberland Fusiliers]], the [[Royal Warwickshire Regiment]], the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], and the [[Manchester Regiment]]. These eight line battalions were all recent creations, and an average of 150 men under nominal strength.&lt;/ref&gt; The Army at home was reorganised into six divisions by a Special Army Order dated 1 January 1907, with one "heavy" four-brigade Cavalry Division and two mounted brigades for reconnaissance, along with some Army troops.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 261-2. Two divisions were based at Aldershot, one in the Eastern Command, two in Ireland, and one in Southern Command.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1907, Haldane announced the coming year's spending estimates; despite the creation of the new force, the disbanded units and other minor efficiencies had managed to reduce overall spending by two to three million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 264-5. The actual figure was a year-on-year decrease of £2,036,000. Coupled with this, however, Haldane had organised matters so that all Army funding would now be paid for in that year's Estimates, rather than with money borrowed during the year, so the total spending reductions were perhaps a million more.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the Territorial Force===
{{main|Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907|Territorial Force}}

[[Image:E Company Liverpool Scottish HU 57197.jpg|thumb|right|A company of the [[Liverpool Scottish]], a Territorial unit, on parade after mobilisation in September 1914]]
Once the Regular Army had been organised as a continental Expeditionary Force, it would be necessary to provide forces for home defence. Haldane's proposal anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Army - the Regular Army, the Volunteers/[[Yeomanry]] and the [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] - should be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence [[Territorial Force]] administered by [[County Territorial Association]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

These changes were embodied in the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]], which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 280-5&lt;/ref&gt; It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry, and used them to create a new Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions, fourteen cavalry brigades, and a large number of support units, all raised, organised and financed by local organisations but liable for service under War Office command. The Militia provided the [[Special Reserve]], which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be liable for service with the regular forces in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training and doctrine===

In November 1906, [[Douglas Haig]] was appointed Director of Staff Duties at the War Office, and took up the task of providing a new training doctrine for the Army. The Esher Report had suggested a new scheme for two sets of training manuals, but these had not been fully implemented. In 1907, the new provisional "Field Service Pocket Book" was produced, revised the following year, and finally standardised as "Field Service Regulations, Part I - Operations" in 1909. This was to serve as the training manual for all branches of the service, and was the synthesis of the generally agreed tactical and strategic principles which had emerged from the South African War.&lt;ref name="Dunlop, pp. 292-3"&gt;Dunlop, pp. 292-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Part II, "Administration", however, was more contentious. Haig was strongly in favour of an entirely new system, where the manual would cover the whole organisation of a field army, including base and lines-of-communication troops as well as field units. This was strongly opposed by the Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General staff, who felt that it was unnecessary, and resented such an imposition on their 'territory' by what they saw as an outsider. However, with Haldane's support, Haig was able to push this through and ensure its adoption.&lt;ref name="Dunlop, pp. 292-3"/&gt;

===Officer Training Corps===

{{main|Officers' Training Corps#History|l1=Officer's Training Corps}}

One issue that was foreseen as a potential problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under [[Sir Edward Ward, 1st Baronet, of Wilbraham Place|Sir Edward Ward]] to study the matter. It issued two reports, one focusing on university and school corps, and one on the Special Reserve. The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an ad-hoc basis as part of the broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Army Order 160 of 1908, contingents of the "Senior Division" were established in universities, and contingents of the "Junior Division" in [[Public school (England)|public schools]]. Army Order 178, later the same year, provided a standard set of regulations, stating that the scheme was intended to provide "a standardized degree of elementary military training with a view to providing candidates for commissions".&lt;ref name="Dunlop2945"&gt;Dunlop, p. 294-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme was popular; by the end of 1910, there were 19 contingents of the "Senior Division" and 152 of the "Junior Division", and one year later, at the start of 1912, this had risen to 55 and 155 respectively. A total of 23,700 cadets were enrolled as of 1 January 1912, with 630 officers, and 830 former cadets had already gone on to take commissions in the auxiliary forces.&lt;ref name="Dunlop2945"/&gt;

===Imperial General Staff===

In the later part of the nineteenth century, the emphasis of Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions&lt;ref&gt;A [[Dominion]] was a self-governing quasi-independent part of the British Empire; at this point, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and later South Africa.&lt;/ref&gt; began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin to take responsibility for strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. The culmination of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries had played a significant role.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

However, whilst the forces were developing locally, the goals of a comprehensive Imperial defence policy remained constant. A proposal was made to a conference of Dominion leaders in 1907, which recommended that all Imperial forces be organised along a standard model, similar to the recent divisional reorganisation of the British Army and the [[Army in India]] (the combined British Army units in India and the Indian Army units). The conference approved this concept, but carried the idea further, and recommended the creation of a general staff drawn from the forces of the entire Empire. This [[Imperial General Staff]] would serve as a common link between the national forces, and could oversee the development of a single uniform defence scheme. It would also be able to help ensure greater consistency between the forces, though it was carefully laid down that the Imperial General Staff could only offer "guidance" to the local government and General Staff, and would not have any binding authority over the national forces.&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, pp. 295-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The new system was approved by an [[Imperial Defence Conference|Imperial conference in July 1909]], which confirmed the support for the new structure, and the principle of standardisation, as well as emphasising that it was not to limit "the autonomy of the self-governing Dominions".&lt;ref&gt;Dunlop, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914 saw the bulk of the changes put to the test; the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|Expeditionary Force]] of six divisions was quickly sent to the Continent, whilst a Territorial Force of 14 divisions and Reserves were mobilised as planned to provide a second line.&lt;ref name=ensor&gt;Ensor (1936), pp. 525&amp;ndash;526.&lt;/ref&gt; The mobilisation was carried out punctually and the divisions were armed.&lt;ref name=ensor/&gt;

The '''Hebrew Socialist Union in London''' ({{lang-he|Agudas HaSozialistim Holvrim BeLondon}}) was a [[Jew]]ish [[socialist]] organisation in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. Although the membership of the organisation never exceeded forty, it played a significant role in mobilizing Jewish labour activism during its short span of existence. It was the first Jewish socialist organisation in England and its journal ''HaEmes'' ('The Truth') was the first Jewish socialist periodical.&lt;ref name="j1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Lawrence. ''[http://www.jewishcurrents.org/2007-sept-bush.htm Judaism as a Counterculture - Jewish Values Versus Conservative America]&lt;/ref&gt;

The association was founded by ten Jewish immigrants from [[Russia]] on May 9, 1876. The founding meeting took place at 40, Gun Street, [[Spitalfields]]. The group was led by Aaron Liebermann, who became the secretary of the organisation.&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;Alderman, Geoffrey. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MKWEwUxMSQEC Modern British Jewry]''. Oxford [England]: Clarendon Press, 1998. pp. 169-171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tai"&gt;Kershen, Anne J. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ifEhGLVe-VEC Uniting the Tailors: Trade Unionism Amongst the Tailoring Workers of London and Leeds, 1870-1939]''. Ilford, Essex, England: F. Cass, 1995. pp. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt; Other founding members included Lazar Goldenberg (who, along with Liebermann, had worked with the Russian publication ''[[Vpered!]]'') and Isaac Stoune.&lt;ref name="fra"&gt;Frankel, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917]''. Cambridge [England]: Cambridge University Press, 1984. pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt;

In total the Hebrew Socialist Union held 26 meetings during 1876. Meetings were held in [[Yiddish]]. The statues of the organisation, edited by Liebermann, were published in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="fra"/&gt;

Liebermann, who himself was a former [[orthodox Jew]] and a drop-out of the rabbinical college of [[Vilna]], adopted a staunchly [[proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] and anti-religious approach. He sought to build a movement which would unite Jewish workers around a socialist, not religious, identity. Furthermore, the Hebrew Socialist Union sought to propaganize for socialism amongst non-Jews as well. For example, Liebermann hoped to build unity between [[Irish migration to Great Britain|Irish]] and Jewish immigrant workers.&lt;ref name="j1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai"/&gt;

The group began holding public meetings across Spitalfields in the year of its foundation. Hundreds of workers attended a meeting held at Goodman's Fields on August 26, 1876.&lt;ref name="j1"/&gt; After the August 26 meeting, a Jewish tailors [[trade union|union]] was formed as an offshoot of the Hebrew Socialist Union. This was the second time a Jewish tailors' union had been formed in London.&lt;ref name="tai"/&gt; The tailors' union had 80 members at its peak.&lt;ref name="fra"/&gt;

Some demands of the Hebrew Socialist Union, such as a call for a ten-hour working day, were well received amongst the Jewish community. But the organisation found itself at loggerheads with the leaders of the Jewish community once it had begun to protest high fees for synangogue marriages.&lt;ref name="j1"/&gt; The ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'', an organ of the Anglo-Jewish establishment, called the representatives of the Hebrew Socialist Union as non-Jews, 'missionaries' and 'enemies'.&lt;ref name="tai"/&gt;

In September 1876 tensions between its socialist core and religious minded workers erupted inside the tailors' union. The union declared itself independent from the Hebrew Socialist Union. At the a meeting of the union, Liebermann was physically assaulted by the religious unionists. Later, the treasurer of the tailors' union disappeared, along with the union funds. Verbal attacks against the Hebrew Socialist Union on behalf of local rabbis persisted, and splits emerged between the founders of the organisation. In December 1876, Liebermann left England. By that time the organisation had disappeared.&lt;ref name="j1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fra"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1664">The '''Historic Sites Act''' of 1935 was enacted by the [[United States Congress]] largely to organize the myriad federally own parks, monuments, and historic sites under the [[National Park Service]] and the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]].  However, it is also significant in that it declared for the first time "...that it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/local-law/FHPL_HistSites.pdf ''Historic Sites Act of 1935''], 49 Stat. 666; 16 U.S.C. sections 461-467.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is the first assertion of historic preservation as a government duty, which was only hinted at in the 1906 [[Antiquities Act]].

Section 462 of the act enumerates a wide range of powers and responsibilities given to the National Park Service and the Secretary of the Interior, including:
*codification and institutionalization of the temporary [[Historic American Buildings Survey]]
*authorization to survey and note significant sites and buildings (this became National Historic Landmark program, which was integrated into the National Register after the 1966 [[National Historic Preservation Act]])
*authorization to actually perform preservation work
Section 463 established the National Park System Advisory Board to assist the Secretary of the Interior with administration.

The local police did not intervene in the massacre, pursue a [[First information report]] filed by survivors or help resettle the survivors. The mass graves at the massacre were rediscovered in January 2011. A similar massacre occurred in nearby [[Pataudi]].

==Background==
During the [[Partition of India]], Hondh village was settled by 16 families who migrated from [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="ranjan1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/321626/Chillar-tears-lost-to-wind-as-cops-%E2%80%98lose%E2%80%99-FIR.html|title=Chillar tears lost to wind as cops ‘lose’ FIR|last=Ranjan|first=Rakesh|date=10 March 2011|work=The Pioneer|accessdate=9 March 2011|location=Rewari district}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hondh was a "dhani", or cluster of farmhouses, outside the main village of Chillar.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt; The families were influential and prior to the massacre the [[Sarpanch]], or mayor, of Chillar had been one of the residents of Hondh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-23/india/28626109_1_sikhs-hondh-chillar-village-ludhianabased-manwinder-singh-giaspur|title='Evidence of abominable crime against Sikhs' – Times Of India|last=Bhatia|first=Ramaninder K|date=23 Feb 2011|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the October 1984 [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi]], thousands of Sikhs were killed in the [[1984 Anti-Sikh pogroms]] by Indian National Congress mobs being aided by government officials who provided "trucks and state busses" as well as "weapons-including oil, kerosene, and other flammable materials".&lt;ref name="Charny1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Charny|first=Israel W.|title=Encyclopedia of genocide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Q30HcvCVuIC&amp;pg=PA516|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-87436-928-1|pages=516–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack happened in two waves. On 1 November 1984 a Hindu attempted to storm the village but the Sikh villagers were able to fend them off.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main49.asp?filename=Ne120311EXCLUSIVE.asp|title=1984. Genocide in Pataudi. Not a whisper escaped|date=12 March 2011|work=[[Tehelka]]|publisher=Tehelka|accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at 10&amp;nbsp;AM on 2 November, a truck and a bus carrying "200-250" Congress young men arrived at the village.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt; They began attacking the Sikhs armed with rods, [[Fighting stick|lathis]], diesel, kerosene, and matches as well as chanting slogans in favor of the [[Congress (I)]] party.&lt;ref name="ranjan1"/&gt; For four hours the Congress members mob beat to death and burned alive 31 Sikh villagers.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt; They continued to burn down the Sikhs' bungalows and [[Gurdwara]] until the villagers who were able to escape the initial attack tried to  find shelter in three different houses. The mob then set two of the houses on fire by pouring kerosene through the roof.&lt;ref name="ranjan1"/&gt; One villager, Balwant Singh, retaliated by killing one of the rioters with a sword and another group of villagers ran out of their burning house to fight back.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ranjan1"/&gt; Once the villagers started fighting back the massacre "came to an abrupt halt".&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt;

On the night of 2 November, the 32 surviving Sikhs found shelter in a nearby village.&lt;ref name="ranjan1"/&gt; Under the cover of night they escaped to [[Rewari]] in a tractor trolley.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt; Once the villagers started fighting back the massacre "came to an abrupt halt".&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt; The survivors now reside in [[Ludhiana]] and [[Bathinda]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] &lt;ref&gt;ਰੋਜਾਨਾ ਅਜੀਤ (ਜਲੰਧਰ), ਅੰਕ: 18 ਫਰਵਰੀ, 2011. ਵੇਖੋ: ਐਸ. ਐਸ. ਬਾਵਾ ਦੀ ਵਿਸ਼ੇਸ਼ ਰਿਪੋਰਟ; ਪੰਨਾ: 1 ਅਤੇ 2&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[First information report|FIR]] was filed by Dhanpat Singh, the then [[sarpanch]], or mayor, of Chillar at police station Jatusana in [[Mahendragarh district]], which is now in [[Rewari district]].&lt;ref name="bhatia1"/&gt; It reveals the killers first came from Hali Mandi{{#tag:ref|Also referred to as Haily Mandi. It is right next to Pautadi.|group=note}} around 11&amp;nbsp;AM but were persuaded by the villagers to turn around.&lt;ref name="bhatia1"/&gt; When they came in the evening they had several more trucks of reinforcements and a group of three Hindus had tried to persuade the killers to leave the village but were intimidated into leaving.&lt;ref name="bhatia1"/&gt; It reports that 20 of the dead Sikh villagers' bodies were burned beyond recognition.&lt;ref name="bhatia1"/&gt;

On 23 February 2011, the local police claimed to have lost the First information report, however ''[[The Times of India]]'' was able to find a signed copy of the report which had been obtained from the same police station just days earlier.&lt;ref name="bhatia1"/&gt;

==Pataudi massacre==

{{Quote box |quote=The media, the Sikh organizations, the politicians had all labeled the riots as the ‘Delhi riots’...We were scared and alone, what could we do? We did not have the time, resources or support to fight against the system. And to be honest, when you lose your whole world, your will to fight dies. -Survivor quoted by [[Tehelka]]&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt;
|width  = 50% |align  = right}}
At 6&amp;nbsp;PM on 1 November 1984 after Indira Gandhi was shot, a  mob under the guidance of Congress leader [[Lalit Maken]] set fire to [[Pataudi]]'s [[Gurdwara]] which created a panic in the city.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt; As the armed mob rampaged through the town and set fire to Sikh homes in the city, one group of Sikhs escaped to the outskirts while another found shelter in local [[Hindu]] [[Ashram]].&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt;

On 2 November, the Sikhs returned to the city to see the damage done to their homes. Left tired and crying in front of their homes, they became separated from each other, and at 10&amp;nbsp;AM the mob returned and began burning people alive. Many of the Sikhs were able to escape but the Congress mob captured 17 of them, murdered them, and burned their remains to remove evidence.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt;

Although the survivors filed multiple FIRs with the police, none of the assailants were captured or prosecuted. After the massacre many Sikh families fled and only five families remain out of thirty that were settled prior to the massacre.&lt;ref name="tehelka1984"/&gt;

==Rediscovery==
On 22 January 2011, an engineer in [[Gurgaon]], [[Haryana]], Manwinder Singh Giaspur, struck up a conversation with a delivery boy who talked about a "deserted village of Sardars{{#tag:ref|[[Sardar]] is a title commonly used for Sikhs in India.|group=note}}" near his own village.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt; When the boy began talking about [[arson]], Giaspur realized he was talking about the [[1984 anti-Sikh pogroms]].&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt; The boy further told him that recently people had begun to steal wood and bricks from the site so on 23 January Giaspur drove to Chillar and found the site of the massacre.&lt;ref name="indiatimes1"/&gt; After seeing bones inside a building and quotations from the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] on the walls he realized the building was a [[Gurdwara]]. Giaspur then uploaded "50-60" pictures of the village onto [[Facebook]] and sent appeals to various [[Punjabi language]] newspapers to investigate and preserve the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-02-23/india/28626109_1_sikhs-hondh-chillar-village-ludhianabased-manwinder-singh-giaspur|title='Evidence of abominable crime against Sikhs' – Times Of India|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=9 March 2011|date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After not receiving help from the [[SGPC]], Giaspur contacted the [[All India Sikh Students Federation]] and [[Sikhs for Justice]]. On 13 March, the man who discovered the site of the massacre was asked to resign from his position as [[general manager]] of V&amp;S International Pvt Ltd, allegedly for his role in exposing the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-13/india/28685890_1_manwinder-singh-giaspur-garment-exports-judicial-probe|title=Man who exposed Hondh Chillar loses job – Times Of India|last=Singh|first=IP|date=13 March 2011|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
On 2 March 2011 members of [[Akali Dal]], the main Sikh political party in India, demanded that the [[Lok Sabha]], India's parliament, form a probe to look into the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1501655.ece|title=Alleged killing of Sikhs disrupts proceedings|last=KUMAR|first=VINAY|date=2 March 2011|work=[[The Hindu]]|accessdate=12 March 2011|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Robertson''' (3 February 1913 &amp;ndash; May 1987) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] politician, who sat as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] before co-founding the [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party]] (SLP) in 1976.

Robertson was a toolmaker and engineer and was assistant divisional organiser of the [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]] 1954-61 and secretary of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] Iron and Steel Trades Joint Committee. He served as a councillor on [[Lanarkshire]] [[County Council]] and [[Motherwell and Wishaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell and Wishaw]] Council from 1946.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]] Robertson stood as the Labour candidate in the marginal Conservative-held seat of [[Glasgow Scotstoun (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Scotstoun]], losing by 625 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge51/i09.htm Not updated: UK General Election results: October 1951&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] ten years later at the [[Paisley by-election, 1961|1961 by-election]] in the [[Paisley (UK Parliament constituency)|Paisley]] constituency, following the appointment of sitting MP [[Douglas Johnston, Lord Johnston|Douglas Johnston]] as a judge in the [[Court of Session]]. He was re-elected at five subsequent general elections, sitting as a Labour MP until 1976, and for the SLP between 1976 and 1979. He did not contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].

On 18 January 1976 Robertson, along with another Labour MP, [[Jim Sillars]] and Labour's senior Scottish researcher, [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]], officially established the Scottish Labour Party (SLP).
The formation of the SLP was prompted as a left-wing split from the mainstream Labour Party over distrust about how strong the then Labour government's stated commitment to Scottish [[devolution]] was in reality.  Robertson was a leading figure in the SLP, along with Sillars, but unlike Sillars he stood down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], deciding not to contest his Paisley seat. The Scottish Labour Party was officially disbanded in 1981, after failing to win any seats at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].

The [[Glossary of Nazi Germany|Nazi terms]]  '''''judenfrei''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjuːdn̩ˌfʁaɪ|lang}}, "free of Jews") and '''''judenrein''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjuːdn̩ˌʁaɪn|lang}}, "clean of Jews") designated an area that was "[[ethnic cleansing|cleansed]]" of Jews during [[The Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopaedia Judaica |chapter=Judenrein |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Scheffler |chapterurl=http://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/judenrein |date=2007 |edition=2 |oclc= |publisher=Thomson Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''judenfrei'' referred merely to "freeing" an area of all of its Jewish inhabitants, the term ''judenrein'' (literally "clean of Jews") was also used. This had the stronger connotation that any trace of Jewish blood had been removed as an impurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shoaheducation.judahsglory.com/aryan.html |title=Aryanization: Judenrein &amp; Judenfrei |work=shoaheducation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in Israeli–Palestinian conflict==
In the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a fear among many Israelis which has been reflected by Israeli government officials such as [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/09/us-israel-palestinians-judenrein-idUSTRE5685LP20090709|title = Judenrein!

On July 9, 2009, Benjamin Netanyahu, in a discussion with the German foreign minister [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] is reported to have said, using the Israeli terms of the area, "Judea and Samaria cannot be ''judenrein''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Reuters and DPA |date=July 9, 2009 |title=German FM: Settlements Remain Obstacle to Peace; Frank-Walter Steinmeier says is encouraged by Israel's acceptance of a two-state solution |newspaper=Haaretz |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/german-fm-settlements-remain-obstacle-to-peace-1.279664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land reforms were attempted in Sicily Since the 18th century. Their goal was to free the peasants from the bondages of [[feudalism]], but currently they are regarded as one of the main causes for the rise of the [[Sicilian Mafia]].

== In the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] ==
Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land. They enforced law and order through their private armies, which were also used to keep unruly workers and tenants in line.

In 1773, in the [[Palermo]] revolt, guilds (maestranza) urged peasants to apply for the nationalized lands of the [[Jesuits]]. in 1781-1786, Viceroy [[Caracciolo]] ruled that the [[fief]]s of nobles now belong to the king. He also declared that private armies are illegal. Peasant obligations to lords were reduced.&lt;ref name="powelson"&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0899462189 | title = The Story of Land - | trans-title = A World History of Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform | last1 = Powelson | first1 = John | year = 1987 | publisher = [[Lincoln Institute of Land Policy]] | location = Cambridge, MA, USA| pages = 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1789, an edict called for enclosure of common lands, to be distributed to the poor in [[copyhold]] in exchange for yielding some of their feudal rights. However, most peasants were too poor to buy their rights, and the laws could be interpreted and enforced only by local magistrates. As a result, the rich became richer and the poor became poorer. A rural [[proletariat]] was created.&lt;ref name=powelson/&gt;

After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. [[Primogeniture]] was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land was to become private property of the peasants.&lt;ref name=sardell&gt;Jason Sardell, [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-103313/unrestricted/JSardellMafia.pdf Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the [[Kingdom of Italy]] ==
In the 1860s, After Italy annexed Sicily in the [[Italian unification]] wars, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens.

Some scholars claim that the unification forces did not favor land reform, and with little benefit to them, the peasants rebelled. The insurrection was put down in 1865, killing 5000 peasants.&lt;ref name=powelson/&gt;

Other scholars claim that, on the contrary, the redistribution resulted in a huge boom in landowners: from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861.&lt;ref name=bandiera&gt;[[Oriana Bandiera]], [http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025549/http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf |date=2012-03-19 }}, 2001, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism.&lt;ref name="Gambetta1993"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gambetta | first = Diego | title = The Sicilian Mafia : the business of private protection | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, Mass | year = 1996 | isbn = 0674807421|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of manpower was also a problem: there were often less than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity from the law in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mack Smith. ''A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713''. p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding these problems was banditry: rising food prices,&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt; the loss of public and church lands,&lt;ref name=sardell/&gt; and the loss of feudal [[common rights|commons]] pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors.  These extralegal protectors would eventually organize themselves into the first [[Sicilian Mafia]] clans.&lt;ref&gt;The last paragraph was copied from [[Sicilian Mafia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Portuguese Legion''' ({{lang-pt|Legião Portuguesa}}) was a Portuguese paramilitary state organization founded in 1936 during the Portuguese President of the Council´s [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s right-wing regime, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]]. It was dissolved in 1974.

Its stated objectives were to "''defend the spiritual heritage [of Portugal]''" and to "''fight the [[communist]] threat and [[anarchism]]''".

The Portuguese Legion was under the control of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] and [[Ministry of War|War]], and was responsible for coordinating [[civil defense]] in Portuguese territory, including in the [[Portuguese Empire]]. It was deeply involved in multiple collaborations with [[PIDE]], the political police. They used the [[Roman salute]] and also used to shout the name of Salazar in their parades.

==Membership==
Membership in the Portuguese Legion was open to any height person over 18 years of age.

Members of the Portuguese Legion were divided into three levels:&lt;br&gt;
''Escalão das Actividade Militares:''  included legionaries from the ages of 18 to 45.&lt;br&gt;
''Escalão Privativo da DCT'': Members 45 and older.&lt;br&gt;
''Escalão de Serviços Moderados'': Only open to members over the age of 60.

==Organisation==
===Naval Brigade===
The ''Brigada Naval da LP'' was established on 5 December 1938, with the aim to revive maritime traditions of Portugal. With a strong connection to the [[Portuguese Navy]]. The Naval Brigade had a large amount of autonomy in relation to the rest of the Legion, having its own command and wearing a different uniform.

With the Naval Brigade as a reserve force for the Navy, its militia officers formed the ''Reserva Legionária (Reserva L)'' of the Navy.

The Naval Brigade was based at the Marinheiros Barracks in [[Alcântara, Lisbon]] – where it had a battalion and a band – and had detachments in [[Porto]], [[Ponta Delgada]] and [[Angra do Heroísmo]].

==Oath==
The official oath of the Portuguese Legion was:
{|cellspacing="0" rules="cols"
!Portuguese Text !! English translation
|-
|
Como legionário, juro obediência aos meus chefes na defesa da Pátria e da ordem social&lt;br&gt;
e afirmo solenemente pela minha honra que tudo sacrificarei, incluindo a própria vida, se tanto for necessário,&lt;br&gt;
ao serviço da Nação, do seu património espiritual, da moral cristã e da liberdade da terra portuguesa.
|
As a Legionnaire, I swear obedience to my leaders in the defense of the Fatherland and of the social order&lt;br&gt;
and solemnly affirm on my honor that I will sacrifice everything, including my life, if necessary,&lt;br&gt;
for the service of the Nation, its spiritual heritage, of the Christian morality and freedom of the Portuguese land.&lt;br&gt;
|-
|}

In addition to the legionnaires, there were subscribers who were not members of the LP, but contributed to its financing.

==Uniform==

The uniform of the Portuguese Legion consisted of brown pants and a [[Dolman|dolmã]], a traditional Portuguese military tunic, a green shirt, and tie. In the ''Brigada Naval'' of the LP the trousers and dolmã were dark blue.

==War Cry==
The official war cry of the Portuguese Legion was:
{|cellspacing="0" rules="cols"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''Ligestillingsrådet''' or the '''Danish Equal Opportunities Council''' was attached to the [[Ministry of the State of Denmark|Danish Ministry of State]] (prime-minister's office) from 1975 to 2000. It coordinated legislation and claims in connection with the government's [[equal opportunities]] work. The Council ceased to exist with the establishment of a [[Minister for Gender Equality (Denmark)|Ministry for Gender Equality]] or ''Ligestillingsministeriet'' in 2000. Since October 2011, its interests have been undertaken by the [[Minister for Ecclesiastical Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry for Equal Opportunities and Ecclesiastical Affairs]].&lt;ref name=dh&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/ligestillingsraadet/|title=Ligestillingsrådet, 1975-2000|publisher=DanmarksHistorien|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Kvindesagen/Ligestillingsr%C3%A5det|title=Ligestillingsrådet|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=3 May 2017 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council consisted of a chairmen and eight permanent members representing the [[social partners]], [[women's organisations]] and [[gender studies|gender researchers]]. By far its most important concern was equality in the [[labour market]], especially the problem of [[equal pay]]. Workload increased as the Council dealt with more complex legislation from the [[Folketing]] and the [[European Union]], in addition to demands on global orientations.&lt;ref name=dh/&gt;

The Council was increasingly criticized for its lack of impact, particularly in the 1999 report on ''Det fremtidige ligestillingsarbejde'' (Future Gender Equality Work). Under the leadership of [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], the government therefore decided in 2000 that the Council should be abolished in favour of an independent ministry charged with priorities for future work on gender equality.&lt;ref name=dh/&gt; A new parliamentary standing committee ''Ligebehandlingsnævnet'' (The Gender Equality Committee) was established in 2009 to deal with cases involving national and international gender equality issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Samfund%2c_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Ministerier%2c_styrelser%2c_udvalg_og_r%c3%a5d/Ligebehandlingsn%c3%a6vnet|title=Ligebehandlingsnævnet|publisher=''Den Store Danske''|accessdate=3 May 2017|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22090">The '''literary inquisition'''  ({{zh|s=文字獄|p=wénzìyù|l=imprisonment due to writings}}) or '''speech crime''' ({{zh|c=以言入罪|links=no}}) refers to official persecution of intellectuals for their writings in [[China]]. The ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' defines it as "the ruler deliberately extracts words or phrases from intellectual's writings and arbitrarily accuse him in order to persecute him" ("旧时谓统治者为迫害知识分子，故意从其著作中摘取字句，罗织成罪").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Han yu da ci dian|date=(2003 printing)|publisher=Han yu da ci dian chu ban she|others=Luo, Zhufeng., 罗竹风., Han yu da ci dian bian ji wei yuan hui., Han yu da ci dian bian zuan chu., 汉语大词典编辑委員会., 汉语大词典编纂处.|isbn=978-7543200166|edition=Di 2 ban|location=Shanghai|oclc=48854704}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Inquisition took place under each of the dynasties ruling China, although the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] was particularly notorious for the practice. In general, there are two ways a literary inquisition could be carried out. First is that the conviction came from the writing itself. That is, the writing was the direct cause of the persecution. The second is that the writing was used as a tool to provide legitimate evidence for a predetermined conviction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Zhongguo wen huo shi|last=Qiguang.|first=Hu|last2=胡奇光.|date=1993|publisher=Shanghai ren min chu ban she|isbn=978-7208015852|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Shanghai|oclc=31125076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such persecutions could owe even to a single phrase or word which the ruler considered offensive. Some of these were due to [[naming taboo]], such as writing a Chinese character that is part of the emperor's personal name. In the most serious cases, not only the writer, but also his immediate and extended families, as well as those close to him, would also be implicated and killed.

==Before Song dynasty==
The earliest recorded literary inquisition occurred in 548 BC in the state of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. Recorded in the ''[[Zuo zhuan]]'', the powerful minister Cui Zhu (崔杼), who had murdered the ruler [[Duke Zhuang II of Qi|Duke Zhuang]], killed three court historians (Taishi, 太史) because they insisted on recording the event in the official history. The [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]] in [[Qin dynasty]] is also considered a form of literary inquisition by some Chinese scholars.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/276910255|title=Zhi ming wen zi : Zhongguo gu dai wen huo zhen xiang|last=Zhongqin.|first=Li,|last2=李钟琴.|date=2008|publisher=Anhui ren min chu ban she|isbn=9787212032289|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Hefei Shi|oclc=276910255}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/192095474|title=Zhongguo wen zi yu|last=Yelin.|first=Wang,|last2=王业霖.|date=2007|publisher=Hua cheng chu ban she|isbn=9787536049109|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Guangzhou Shi|oclc=192095474}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is uncertain how frequently the persecutions occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ku|Goodrich|1938|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, compared to [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty]], literary inquisition before [[Song dynasty]] happened less frequently due to the lack of printing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Han Dynasty ===

One major case in [[Han dynasty]] was the case of Yang Yun (杨恽). Emperor Xuan first discharged him from his position in the government under the accusation of defamation. In 54 BC, he was sentenced to death through [[waist chop]] because of his complaints on his unfair treatment written in a letter for his friend Sun, which was considered disrespectful and outrageous to the Emperor. Affected by this, his friends who were still in court, were also discharged from their positions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Kong Rong]], a lead figure of the [[Seven Scholars of Jian'an]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;in late [[Eastern Han dynasty]], was killed by warlord [[Cao Cao]] for his letters to Cao disagreeing and criticizing his rule and practice, including Cao's ban on alcohol for its potential negative impact on the nation. His wife and two sons were also killed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In [[Three Kingdoms]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;period, the death of [[Ji Kang]] was also related to his writing. In response to [[Sima Zhao]]'s offer of a position as civil official, Ji Kang wrote a letter (“与山巨源绝交书”) expressing his refusal of pursuing any political career. This letter, however, later provided justification for the advice of [[Zhong Hui]], the official who conveyed the offer for Sima Zhao to Ji Kang, to sentence Ji Kang to death.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29495277|title=San qian nian wen huo|last=Canglin.|first=Xie,|last2=谢苍霖.|date=1991|publisher=Jiangxi gao xiao chu ban she|others=Wan, Fangzhen., 万芳珍.|isbn=7810331175|edition=Di 1 ban|location=Nanchang Shi|oclc=29495277}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Southern and Northern Dynasties ===
During [[Northern Wei]] dynasty, prime minister [[Cui Hao]] carved ''Guo Shu''("国书"), which records the history of the ruling [[Tuoba]] clan and of which he was assigned as the lead editor, into stone monuments and located them on the side of a major road in suburb of the capital. The Xianbei bureaucrats found exposing their ancestor's history to the public was offensive and inappropriate. Thus, Cui Hao was accused of defaming the state and thus sentenced to death in 450. Along with Cui Hao, his whole clan, his wives' clans and 128 officials participated in the editing work were all sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sui Dynasty ===
In 609, Xue Daoheng, the grandfather of [[Xue Yuanchao]], was sentenced to death [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]] of [[Sui dynasty|Sui Dynasty]]. In response to Emperor Yang's attempt to keep Xue from retiring, Xue wrote an essay praising the previous [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]]. Emperor Yang considered this response as a mockery and found it offensive. The direct cause of Xue's death was his saying in reminiscence of Gao Jiong (高熲), who supported Emperor Yang's competitor and was sentenced to death. However, there is also evidence for that the underlying cause of his death was Emperor Yang's jealousy of his talent on poetry as the author of the famous poem "XiXiYan" (“昔昔盐”) from Sui dynasty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In this case, Xue's death could also be considered as a literary inquisition on poem (诗祸, shihuo).

== Song Dynasty ==
During [[Song dynasty]], the concept of literary inquisition started to take formal shape. Unlike isolated cases in previous dynasties, literary inquisition in Song dynasty became a tool in political struggles, consciously and purposefully used by opposing political parties to suppress and eliminate opponents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; However, because the founding emperor of Song dynasty, Emperor Taizu, vowed to not kill any scholar or intellectuals who wrote to comment or address on political issues, intellectuals involved in literary inquisition in Song dynasty were often exiled instead of sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Northern Song ===
In 1079, the poet [[Su Shi]] of [[Song dynasty]] was jailed for several months and later exiled by the Emperor Shenzong due to an accusation of writing and disseminating poems alleged to slander the court.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartman|first=Charles|date=1993|title=The Inquisition against Su Shih: His Sentence as an Example of Sung Legal Practice|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/603027|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=113|issue=2|pages=228–243|doi=10.2307/603027}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was also related to the political context at that time. The state was undergoing socioeconomic reform, [[New Policies (Song dynasty)|New Policies]], led by Chancellor [[Wang Anshi]]. Su Shi as a conservative at the time, however, had expressed his disagreement with certain practices of this reform. Such action triggered the anger of people in support of the reform, which included several persons from the Censorate (yushitai, 御史台) responsible for surveilling officials and fact-finding in the case of legal procedure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48764337|title=Censorship : a world encyclopedia|date=2001|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|others=Jones, Derek.|isbn=1579581358|location=London|oclc=48764337}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the censorates, Li Ding, initiated the case by writing to the Emperor and accusing Su Shi for defamation. Under his effort, the Censorate pointed out more than 60 spots of evidence across more than 10 of Su Shi's poems and identified more than 20 people who have communicated with Su Shi through writings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Southern Song ===
Southern Song, especially during [[Qin Hui]]'s tenure as the Chancellor, marked the rise of extensive and systematic use of literary inquisition for political purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartman|first=Charles|date=2003|title=The Misfortunes of Poetry Literary Inquisitions under Ch'in Kuei (1090-1155)|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3594281|journal=Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews (CLEAR)|volume=25|pages=25–57|doi=10.2307/3594281}}&lt;/ref&gt; In face of invasion from [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Dynasty]] to northern part of China, the debate in the court was between the "pro-war party" led by [[Yue Fei]] and "anti-war party" advocating peace treaties with Jin. As the leader of "anti-war party", Qin Hui used literary inquisition as a tool to intimidate or eliminate his political opponents in order to reach political conformity on the threat of Jin invasion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Qin Hui targeted specifically on the leading figures of "pro-war party", Zhao Ding (赵鼎), Hu Quan (胡铨) and Li Guang (李光). In 1138, in response to Jin's humiliating terms in their peace negotiation that would render Song as subservient state, both Zhao Ding and Hu Quan expressed strong objections. As a result, Zhao Ding was removed by Qin Hui from his position as Great Councilor in the fall of 1138.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; He was later exiled to todays [[Hainan]] where he committed suicide in 1147 when Qin Hui took action against his writing declaring again his determination against peace negotiation with Jin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Meanwhile, Hu Quan wrote in his memorial in 1138 that accepting these terms would be "[taking] the Empire of Your ancestors and [turning] it into the Empire of these dog barbarians".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; While these phrases spoke out for the public sentiment toward the peace negotiation, Qin Hui took it as rebellious and called for severe punishment of Hu as an example to stop other officials from doing the same. Therefore, Hu was dismissed from office, exiled to Zhaochou (昭州) and forbidden from reinstatement.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;

Li Guang was also punished for his outspoken criticism of Qin Hui being a traitor. Qin Hui thus accused Li of resentment and ill will, and exiled him to today's [[Guangxi]] province in 1141. In 1150, he was further exiled to Hainan because of his attempt to compose a "private history" (野史), which was forbidden and alleged slanderous by the Emperor and Qin Hui due to their fear of potential negative record of their doings. Li Guang's case involved several other officials associated to him. One of them was Wu Yuanmei (吴元美), who was demoted as a result of Li's case. He then wrote "Tale of Two Sons of Xia" ("夏二子传") expressing his feelings toward his current situation. In this writing, Wu used words "Xia" (夏) and "Shang" (商), which could be seasons as well as dynasties, and thus could be interpreted as the change of seasons from summer to autumn or the decay of dynasty. Wu also mentioned "flies and mosquitos", which were insects active in the season yet also often served as allegory with despicable person in Chinese culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Therefore, these words provided evidence for Qin Hui to accuse him of defamation and further exiled Hu to today's [[Guangdong]] province, where Hu died. 

==Ming dynasty==
There are records of literary persecutions during the [[Ming dynasty]] and the beginning of the period saw the most severe persecutions. Before he became emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang (the [[Hongwu Emperor]]), the Ming dynasty's founder, was illiterate and had been a beggar. While he established his empire, he surrounded himself with scholars, treating them with respect while he learnt to read and familiarise himself with history. He sent out requests to scholars for their presence, and while many agreed others declined for fear of the repercussions if they made a mistake. On occasion the emperor, who was learning to read, would order the execution of someone who had written something he misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ku|Goodrich|1938|pp=255–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qing dynasty==
The rulers of the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] are particularly notorious for their use of literary inquisitions. The Manchus were an ethnic minority who had defeated the [[Han Chinese]]-led [[Ming dynasty]]; as such, they were sensitive to public sentiments towards them.&lt;ref name="Gu 126"&gt;{{harvnb|Gu|2003|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers and officials usually took the stance of drawing distinctions between the Han Chinese and the Manchus; the latter were traditionally viewed as barbarians in Han Chinese culture. However, while the Manchus were in charge, writers resorted to veiled satire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ku|Goodrich|1938|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gu Mingdong, a specialist in Chinese literature and intellectual thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://www.utdallas.edu/ah/people/faculty_detail.php?faculty_id=381 |title = Faculty: Gu, Ming Dong |publisher=[[University of Texas at Dallas]] |accessdate=2010-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Manchus became almost paranoid about the meanings associated with the Chinese characters for 'bright' and 'clear', 'Ming' and 'Qing' respectively.&lt;ref name="Gu 126"/&gt;
One inquisition was the "[[Zhuang Tinglong Case|Case of the ''History of the Ming Dynasty'']]" (明史案) in 1661–1662 under the direction of [[regent]]s (before the [[Kangxi Emperor]] came in power in 1669) in which about 70 were killed and more exiled.{{efn|The [[wuxia]] writer [[Jin Yong|Louis Cha]] used this case as a prologue for his novel ''[[The Deer and the Cauldron]]''.}}

Under the Qing dynasty, literary inquisition began with isolated cases during the reigns of the [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzhi]] and Kangxi emperors, and then evolved into a pattern. There were 53&amp;nbsp;cases of literary persecution during the reign of the [[Qianlong Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wong|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1772 and 1793, there was an effort by the Qianlong Emperor to purge "evil" books, poems, and plays. He set out to get rid of works by Ming loyalists who he believed were writing subversive anti-Qing histories of the Manchu conquest. The scale of the destruction cause by this "literary holocaust" is uncertain due to gaps in the imperial archives, however as many as 3,000&amp;nbsp;works may have been lost. An estimated 151,723&amp;nbsp;volumes were destroyed by the inquisition in this period. Amongst the works subject to this treatment were books considered disrespectful towards the Qing emperors or previous ethnic minority dynasties that could be viewed as analogous to the Qing. From 1780 onwards, plays could also be destroyed if they were vulgar or contained anti-Manchu material. Writers who criticised the Qing dynasty could expect to have their entire work erased, regardless of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodside|2002|pp=289–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquisition was often used to express local ambitions and rivalries that had little to do with the ruler's own political interests. It thus generated interclass, as well as intraclass, warfare. For example, commoners could lay charges against scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Woodside|2002|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1753: The Qianlong Emperor's frequent tours of [[Jiangnan]] were partly funded by local governments, and therefore indirectly by the local people. One local official by the name of Lu Lusen, using a higher ranking minister's name, Sun Jiajin, sent a memorial to the emperor, pleading with him to stop the tour for the sake of the local people. The text achieved widespread popular support. Eventually Lu Lusen was sentenced to death by [[slow slicing]] for sedition, his two sons were beheaded, and more than a thousand relatives and acquaintances were either executed, exiled, or thrown into jail according to the notion of "collective responsibility" that automatically applied in cases of sedition.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://big5.china.com.cn/city/txt/2007-03/08/content_7927803.htm 'Kang-Qian shengshi' de wenhua zhuanzhi yu wenziyu]" “康乾盛世”的文化專制與文字獄 [Cultural despotism and literary inquisitions in the 'Kangxi-Qianlong golden age'], in ''Guoshi shiliujiang'' 國史十六講 [Sixteen lectures on the history of China]. Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 2006. Retrieved on 10 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1755: A Provincial Education Commissioner named Hu Zhongzao (胡中藻) wrote a poem in which the character ''qing'' 清, the name of the dynasty, was preceded by ''zhuo'' (浊), which means "murky" or "muddy". The Qianlong Emperor saw this and many other formulations as the taking of a position in the factional struggle that was taking place at the time between the Han Chinese official [[Zhang Tingyu]] and the Manchu official [[Ertai]], who had been Hu's mentor.

The family name of the Ming emperors is  ''Zhū'' (朱), which also means 'red' in Chinese. The Qianlong Emperor then accused Cai Xian of attempting to attack the Manchus by innuendo and ordered Cai's execution.

{{refimprove|date=July 2011}}
A '''make-work job''' is a job that has less immediate financial benefit to the economy than the job costs to support. Make-work jobs are similar to [[workfare]], but are publicly offered on the job market and have otherwise normal employment requirements (workfare jobs, in contrast, may be handed out to a randomly selected applicant or have special requirements such as continuing to search for a non-workfare job).
 
==Criticism and analysis==
Some consider make-work jobs to be harmful when they provide very little practical experience or training for future careers.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Doeringer, B. Vermeulen, ''Jobs and Training in the 1980s'', Boston Studies in Applied Economics, Springer, 1981, {{ISBN|9780898380620}}, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a part of the [[New Deal]], the CWA ([[Civil Works Administration]]) was created as a stopgap measure to boost the economic relief provided by the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] and [[Public Works Administration]].  At its peak, the CWA employed 4,230,000 people; however, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] was wary of the specter of corruption and accusations of [[boondoggling]], and shut the CWA down after less than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Edwin Harrell|title=Unto A Good Land: A History Of The American People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ssSHokISMd8C&amp;pg=PA902|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans |pages=902–|isbn=0802837182|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists like [[Milton Friedman]] considered the programs like the CCC and WPA as justified as a temporary response to an emergency. Friedman gave Roosevelt considerable credit for relieving immediate distress and restoring confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Milton Friedman|author2=Rose D. Friedman|title=Free to Choose|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5z1B5SwGUEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=free+to+choose&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2u8fUqDDHYirsQTF-4DQAQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=free%20to%20choose&amp;f=false|year=1981|publisher=Avon Books|page=85|isbn=0-380-52548-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a socialist nationalized economy, several of the nationalized sectors of work can be considered as make-work jobs, such as when an industry does not make a profit, but is considered essential by the state to the national interest.

==Examples==
Make-work jobs have been introduced during periods of high unemployment to provide as substitutes for regular jobs. In many European countries, social [[welfare]] systems provide cash transfers to those who are unable to secure employment. These programs often require the recipient to undertake job training, internships, or job rotations. Make-work jobs can have the benefit of giving workers the chance of meeting new people and learning how to work with others. Such jobs can also help workers learn the importance of coming to work on time and taking responsibility for their actions.

Many of the skills learned while doing make-work jobs help workers when applying for and doing regular jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE6358042/nyttejob-arbejdsloese-skal-fjerne-hundelorte-og-taelle-biler/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several make-work jobs that were created in Denmark in 2014 were gardening, cleaning up beaches and sidewalks, reading to the elderly or disabled, washing toys at day cares, working with local bike programs, and counting cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyllands-posten.dk/premium/indland/article6416669.ece/ALTERNATES/h-free/Nyttejob-wilke_adw.eps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In the novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (novel)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', Bob Ewell loses his New Deal make-work job, and blames [[Atticus Finch]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5150">In [[voting theory]], the '''micromega rule''' holds that, when [[political party|political parties]] choose [[electoral systems]], "the large prefer the small and the small prefer the large". The term "micromega" references ''[[Micromégas]]'', a tale by [[Voltaire]] in which dwarfs and giants dialogue.

==Party preferences==
For electoral rules, it is postulated that a few large parties tend to prefer small assemblies, small [[district magnitude]]s (the smallest being one), and rules based on small quotas of votes for allocating seats (the smallest being [[Plurality voting system|simple plurality]], which does not require any specific threshold), while multiple small parties tend to prefer large assemblies, large district magnitudes, and large quotas (like those of proportional representation: within [[proportional representation]] systems, given the same number of seats, systems with a higher quota such as [[Hare quota|Hare]] or [[Sainte-Laguë method|Sainte-Laguë]] favour smaller parties, while systems with a lower quota such as [[Droop quota|Droop]] or [[D'Hondt method|D'Hondt]] favour larger parties). Large parties may prefer small [[Political institution|institutions]] in order to exclude others from competition, while small parties prefer large institutions able to include them within. More specifically, political configurations in which there is a single dominant party or two rather balanced parties tend to produce choices in favor of rather restrictive or exclusionary electoral systems, such as those based on plurality rule in single-member districts, while settings with multiple parties tend to support choices in favor of more inclusive electoral formulas, such as those using rules of proportional representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Colomer|first=Josep M.|title=Handbook of electoral system choice|year=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=1-4039-0454-5|edition=1. publ.|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In comparison with Duverger's laws==
This has been seen as an upside-down reading of [[Duverger's law]]s holding that a plurality rule election systems tend to favor a two-party system, while proportional representation tends to multipartism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duverger|first=Maurice|title=Party Politics and Pressure Groups|year=1972|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell|location=New York|pages=23–32|url=http://janda.org/c24/Readings/Duverger/Duverger.htm|chapter=Factors in a Two-Party and Multiparty System}}&lt;/ref&gt; By suggesting, in contrast, that electoral systems are an effect of party systems rather than a cause, it has been shown that changes from a plurality system to a proportional system are typically preceded by the emergence of more than two parties, and are typically not followed by a substantial increase in the number of parties. Existing parties tend, thus, to choose electoral systems that are able to crystallize or consolidate the previously existing party configurations and systems. More generally, electoral systems and other prominent political institutions can be seen as a consequence of already existing political party systems in assemblies and governments, each of which tends to prefer those institutional formulas and procedures that can consolidate, reinforce or increase their relative strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colomer|first=Josep|title=It's the Parties that Choose Electoral Systems, or Duverger's Laws Upside Down|journal=Political Studies|year=2005|volume=53|issue=1|pages=1–21|url=http://works.bepress.com/josep_colomer/2/|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.2005.00514.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Calculating assembly size==
Inspired by the micromega rule, [[Rein Taagepera]] presented the seat product of simple electoral systems, which is obtained by multiplying some transformation of the assembly size by the number of seats in the average district magnitude, in order to predict the number of parties in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taagepera|first=Rein|title=Predicting party sizes : the logic of simple electoral systems|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-928774-0|pages=314|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he acknowledges, the relationship between party systems and electoral systems accepts two-direction lines of [[causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benoit|first=Kenneth|title=Electoral Laws as Political Consequences: Explaining the Origins and Change of Electoral Institutions|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=June 2007|volume=10|issue=1|pages=363–390|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.10.072805.101608}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relevant implication of Taagepera’s equation for political practitioners of institutional design is that if the size of the assembly is rather stable and depends on the country's size, for a small country with a small assembly just a few parties can be sufficient to produce a change of electoral system in favor of proportional representation, while, for a large country and a large assembly, many parties would be necessary to produce such a result.

The '''Ministry of Defence''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Manatū Kaupapa Waonga'') is the public service department of New Zealand responsible for advising the [[Government of New Zealand|government]] on strategic defence policy, acquiring military equipment to meet defence capability and conducting audits and assessments of  [[New Zealand Defence Force|the New Zealand Defence Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ssc.govt.nz/sites/all/files/pif-mod-review-sept12.pdf|title=Performance Improvement Framework: Formal Review of the Ministry of Defence – September 2012|last=SSC|first=|date=September 2012|website=www.ssc.govt.nz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The Defence Act, passed on 17 November 1964, established a new Ministry of Defence. Under the Act the three Service departments were combined into the new Ministry. The central core of the new Ministry of Defence was the central Defence Office.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarters New Zealand Defence Force, [http://archives.govt.nz/sites/default/files/iod/app_id_289_appraisal_report_1.pdf Appraisal Report: New Zealand Army Disposal Schedule], accessed via Archives New Zealand, July 2014. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811141247/http://archives.govt.nz/sites/default/files/iod/app_id_289_appraisal_report_1.pdf |date=11 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Defence Council was established which consisted of:
*Minister of Defence
*Chief of Defence Staff
*Secretary of Defence
*Chiefs of Staff from the three Services
*Co-opted members if required (especially the Secretaries of External Affairs and Treasury)

The Defence Council was responsible for:
*Administering and commanding the Services
*Advising the Minister on defence policy
*Integrating common functions where desirable and practical

The boards for each service continued to exist, but they acted under delegated power from the Defence Council. The Chiefs of Staff Committee was retained, but as a committee of the Defence Council. (The Defence Council was later abolished under the Defence Act 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1990/0028/latest/DLM204973.html| title=Defence Act 1990| work=New Zealand Legislation| publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969-71 moves were implemented to provide a fully centralised administration in control of all non-operational functions previously within the responsibility of the three services. These changes were embodied in a further Defence Act that came into effect on 1 April 1972. The Service Boards were abolished and their functions divided between the Chiefs of Staff and a central Defence Headquarters that replaced the Defence Office. The disadvantage of the continued existence of the Service Boards had been one that the one Service could still express its views to the Minister independently of the other Services. Policy formation and planning, logistics and supply, personnel, administration, finance, civil management, and management services were transferred to the central Defence Headquarters. Each Chief of Staff and their separate Headquarters were now only concerned with operational matters.

In 1989 Defence was separated into two separate bodies – the Ministry of Defence headed by the [[Secretary of Defence]], the senior civilian officer and the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] headed by the [[Chief of Defence Force (New Zealand)|Chief of Defence Force]] (CDF), the senior military officer. Both are equally answerable to the Minister of Defence for their individual elements.

Under the CDF are the three service chiefs who, as the senior officers of their individual services, act as advisors to CDF and provide forces as required.

In 1999 James Rolfe described in ''The Armed Forces of New Zealand'' the then structure of the Ministry of Defence. It numbered only about 70 people in total, with three divisions involved in policy: Policy Division, Acquisition Division, and Evaluation Division. Also part of the structure were Corporate Services Division and Corporate Finance Division.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe, James Grant. The armed forces of New Zealand. St Leonards: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1999, 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Ministry is responsible for the following functions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defence.govt.nz/about-us.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206053452/http://www.defence.govt.nz/about-us.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-02-06 |title=About Us [Ministry of Defence NZ&amp;#93; |publisher=Defence.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7803">The '''National Defense Mediation Board (NDMB)''' was a United States [[Regulatory agency|federal agency]] established by Executive Order 8716 on March 19, 1941, that settled disputes between labor and management during the prewar defense period.&lt;ref name="Atleson"&gt;Atleson, 1998: 30&lt;/ref&gt;  The executive order established the NDMB as a tripartite agency of eleven representatives, four each from labor and industry and three from the public.&lt;ref name="Bernstein"&gt;Bernstein&lt;/ref&gt;  The order vested in the agency the power to “exert every possible effort to assure that all work necessary for national defense shall proceed without interruption and with all possible speed.”&lt;ref name="Atleson" /&gt;  The Board could use either [[mediation]] or voluntary [[arbitration]] to resolve disputes between management and labor in defense industries.&lt;ref name="Atleson_a"&gt;Atleson, 1998: 20&lt;/ref&gt;  If these methods failed, the Board was empowered to investigate controversies, conduct fact-finding, and formulate recommendations.&lt;ref name="Atleson" /&gt;

During the ten months of its existence, the Board received a total of 118 cases of labor disputes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  Since strikes were usually in progress when the Board received its cases, the NDMB’s basic policy was to persuade unions to call off strikes in return for wage retroactivity and a promise of a hearing.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  This was successful in most cases, but, in the rare instances when parties did not heed Board recommendations, the Board forwarded matters to the White House.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  The NDMB ultimately collapsed because of a dispute involving the “captive mines,” during which the Board refused to grant union shop to the [[United Mine Workers]] (UMW).&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;

== History and Creation ==
The NDMB was created largely in response to the high incidence of strikes during the defense-related production boom, which began in 1940.&lt;ref name="Atleson_a" /&gt;  In 1941, more than two million workers participated in more than 4,000 work stoppages, some of which directly disturbed defense production.&lt;ref&gt;Atleson, 1998: 20; Bernstein&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, several antistrike bills were pending in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Atleson, 1998: 21&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sidney Hillman]], a member of the National Defense Advisory Commission, recommended a tripartite mediation board to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] because it might be more acceptable to union leaders than antistrike legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Atleson, 1998: 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) quickly endorsed the proposal, labor’s second major arm, the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), was reluctant to support the creation of the tripartite board.&lt;ref&gt;Atleson, 1998: 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;  CIO’s president, [[Philip Murray]], realized that in preventing and ending strikes, the mediation board would “find its attention directed against labor in order to maintain the status quo.”&lt;ref name="Atleson" /&gt;  Nevertheless, Murray did not oppose the proposal.&lt;ref name="Atleson_a" /&gt;  Shortly thereafter, President Roosevelt issued an executive order creating the NDMB.&lt;ref name="Atleson" /&gt;

== Power and Policies ==
The powers of the NDMB were severely limited by its inability to issue “directive orders” with regard to labor disputes.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  Under Roosevelt’s executive order, only the secretary of labor could certify the NDMB to rule on disputes threatening defense production.&lt;ref name="Atleson_b"&gt;Atleson, 1998: 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Such certification only occurred during disputes that the federal conciliation service could not resolve.&lt;ref name="Atleson_b" /&gt;  Thus, partly because of its inability to render final decision, the NDMB emphasized [[collective bargaining]] and voluntarism, rather than federal determination, in settling labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Atleson, 1998: 31; U.S., 1950: 5&lt;/ref&gt;  In the two cases where voluntary arbitration and mediation had failed and management refused to accept Board recommendations, the president seized the plants by executive order.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, 1994: 285; Atleson, 1998: 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, although the NDMB was often criticized for lacking formal powers of arbitration, the threat of governmental seizure and public pressure to comply with its recommendations gave the Board substantial authority in dispute mediation.&lt;ref name="Atleson_b" /&gt;

The Defense Mediation Board also established precedents in union security agreements. Union security agreements are contracts between labor and industry that determine to what extent unions may compel employees to join unions as a requirement for working.  As James B. Atleson writes, mediation is a difficult model to apply unless parties can reach a compromise on conceptual principles.&lt;ref name="Atleson_c"&gt;Atleson, 1998: 32&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus arose the need for the NDMB to create common ground between labor and industry on union security.  The NDMB enacted the “maintenance of membership clause,” a compromise between labor and management that would be adopted by its successor, the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)National War Labor Board]].&lt;ref name="Atleson_c" /&gt;  Under the clause, employees who were already union members were required to maintain membership with the union for the life of the contract.&lt;ref name="Atleson_d"&gt;Atleson, 1998: 31; Freidin, 1943: 82-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Because employees were not forced to join unions, the policy prevented a closed shop but also avoided the complete disintegration of unions in the wartime economy.&lt;ref name="Atleson_d" /&gt;

== Collapse ==
The NDMB successfully mediated labor disputes for eight months but broke down during the “captive mines” conflict between the steel industry and the United Mine Workers.&lt;ref&gt;U.S., 1950: 6&lt;/ref&gt;  At the heart of the conflict were labor’s demands for union shop in the commercial mines.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  After the UMW called out 50,000 miners in its first strike, the NDMB convinced workers to go back to work while it mediated a settlement.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  However, these attempts at mediation were unsuccessful, and the UMW called a second strike in spite of Roosevelt’s exhortations to not strike again.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;   On November 10, 1941, the NDMB voted nine-to-two against union shop.&lt;ref name="Bernstein" /&gt;  Two labor members of the NDMB, both from the CIO, resigned from the Board, resulting in its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein; Workman, 2000: 250&lt;/ref&gt;  However, shortly following the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt created the [[National War Labor Board (1942–1945)|National War Labor Board]], a similar tripartite agency with expanded powers.&lt;ref&gt;Freidin, 1943: 81&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Walk Free Foundation]] joined with [http://humanityunited.org/ Humanity United] and the [[Legatum|Legatum Foundation]] to establish the [[Freedom Fund]],&lt;ref name="Legatum website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legatum|url=http://www.legatum.org/article/Nick-Grono-Appointed-as-Inaugural-CEO-of-the-100-Million-Freedom-Fund|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the world’s first philanthropic fund dedicated to identifying and investing in the most effective frontline efforts to end [[Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]].&lt;ref name="Freedom Fund" /&gt;
The Freedom Fund was announced by President [[Bill Clinton]] at the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] in September 2013, who declared, “This is a huge deal and we should all support this.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinton Foundation|url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/president-clinton-former-secretary-clinton-and-chelsea-clinton-conclude-2013-cgi|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Fund focuses its work on areas where slavery is prevalent using a “hotspot” funding model. It identifies effective local anti-slavery initiatives and invests to improve their effectiveness and impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Human Rights Funders Group: Founder Directory|url=https://ihrfg.org/funder-directory/freedom-fund|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Global initiatives, which coordinate efforts and resources around industries where slavery is common, are also used. The Fund also strives to strengthen the global movement of activists, experts and donors by providing the platform, knowledge and tools for them to connect and work together more effectively.

The Fund has worked with some 100 frontline partners around the world to directly liberate 16,047 people from slavery and return over 36,231 at risk children back to school. Overall, its programs have positively impacted the lives of over 390,663 of those most vulnerable to exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://freedomfund.org/impact/overview/|title=Our Impact {{!}} The Freedom Fund|work=Freedom Fund|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of the Auditor General of Norway''' ({{lang-no|Riksrevisjonen}}) is the state [[auditor]] of the [[Government of Norway]] and directly subordinate of the [[Parliament of Norway]]. It is responsible for [[auditing]], monitoring and advising all state economic activities, including [[financial audit]]s, [[performance audit]]s and [[corporate governance|corporate control]]. Located in Oslo, it is led by a [[board of directors|board]] of five auditor generals elected for four years and from 2014 it has been led by [[Per-Kristian Foss]]. It is regulated by the ''Auditor General Act of June 1, 2005''.

The office has about 460 employees, mostly recruited among [[economist]]s, [[lawyer]]s and [[social scientist]]s.

==History==
The office dates back to 1814 when the [[Constitution of Norway]] §75 stated that there were to be appointed five auditors by the Parliament of Norway with the first auditors being appointed in 1816. In 1822 the Ministry of Auditing (''Revisjonsdepartementet'') was created as a supplement to the office that originally bore the name ''Statsrevisjonen'' (lit. ''the State Auditing''). When the current [[Parliament of Norway Building]] opened in 1866 the office followed along and stayed in the building until 1890. In 1918 the system is changed and all state auditing is taken over by the office, removing the ministry. In 1938, with 64 against 63 votes, the Parliament of Norway changed the office's name to the current ''Riksrevisjonen'' (lit. ''the National Auditing''). In 1962 the auditing of the [[Norwegian State Railways]], [[Televerket (Norway)|Telegrafverket]] and the [[Posten (Norway)|Postal Service]] were included in the office.

The Auditor General is the head of the Office.

A '''Podyachy''' or '''podyachiy''' ({{Lang-ru|подьячий, sometimes подъячий}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''hypodiakonos,'' "assistant servant") was an [[office]] ([[bureaucratic]]) [[profession|occupation]] in ''[[prikaz]]es'' (local and upper governmental offices) and lesser local offices of [[Russia]] in 15th-18th centuries.

As an anachronism, it may be loosely translated as [[clerk (position)|clerk]] the Latin word equally derived from a clerical title, and generically used.

''Podyachyes'' were classified into junior, middle and senior. A senior ''podyachy'' (Старший подьячий) was a councillor to a ''[[dyak (clerk)|dyak]]''.

[[File:Denge acoustic mirrors-10July2005 (2).jpg|thumb|The acoustic mirrors at Denge. Left to right, the 200 foot, 20 foot and 30 foot mirrors.]]
'''Denge''' is a former [[Royal Air Force]] site near [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]], in [[Kent]], England. It is best known for the early experimental [[acoustic mirror]]s which remain there.

The acoustic mirrors, known colloquially as 'listening ears', at Denge are located between [[Greatstone-on-Sea]] and [[Lydd]] airfield, on the banks of a now disused gravel pit. The mirrors were built in the late 1920s and early 1930s as an experimental early warning system for incoming aircraft, developed by Dr [[William Sansome Tucker]]. Several were built along the south and east coasts, but the complex at Denge is the best preserved, and are protected as scheduled monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num= 1005119 |desc=|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denge complex==
There are three acoustic mirrors in the complex, each consisting of a single [[concrete]] hemispherical reflector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title       = Sound Mirrors on the South Coast

 | url = http://www.andrewgrantham.co.uk/soundmirrors/locations/denge/
 | title = Denge sound mirrors
 | accessdate = 8 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''200 foot mirror''' is a near vertical, curved wall, 200 feet (60m) long. It is one of only two similar acoustic mirrors in the world, the other being in [[Magħtab]], [[Malta]].

[[File:200 ft Acoustic mirror at Denge.jpg|thumb|200 ft Acoustic mirror at Denge]]

*The '''30 foot mirror''' is a circular dish, similar to a deeply curved satellite dish, 9&amp;nbsp;m (30&amp;nbsp;ft) across, supported on concrete buttresses. This mirror still retains the metal microphone pole at its centre.
*The '''20 foot mirror''' is similar to the 30 foot mirror, with a smaller, shallower dish 6&amp;nbsp;m (20&amp;nbsp;ft) across. The design is close to that of an acoustic mirror in [[Kilnsea]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]].

[[File:ListeningEars(PaulRusson)Mar2005.jpg|right|thumb|View of all three mirrors]]
Acoustic mirrors did work, and could effectively be used to detect slow moving enemy aircraft before they came into sight. They worked by concentrating sound waves towards a central point, where a microphone would have been located. However, their use was limited as aircraft became faster. Operators also found it difficult to distinguish between aircraft and seagoing vessels. In any case, they quickly became obsolete due to the invention of [[radar]] in 1932. The experiment was abandoned, and the mirrors left to decay. The gravel extraction works caused some undermining of at least one of the structures.

[[File:Denge acoustic mirrors -bridge -water-10July2005.jpg|right|thumb|The mirrors with the swing bridge visible in the foreground]]
The striking forms of the sound mirrors have attracted artists and photographers. British artist [[Tacita Dean]] created a film inspired by the complex. The band [[Turin Brakes]] featured the mirrors on some of their album covers. The object appeared in the [[music video]] for [[Blank &amp; Jones]]' "A Forest".The mirrors have also been featured in the music videos for ''Invaders Must Die by The Prodigy'' &amp; ''Young Kato - Something Real''.

==Restoration==
In 2003, [[English Heritage]] secured £500,000 from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and from the EU's Interreg programme under the Historic Fortifications Network, as administered by [[Kent County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.culture24.org.uk/science+%26+nature/technology/art17649
 | title = Britain's Concrete Ears To Be Saved By English Heritage
 | accessdate = 12 December 2008 | date = 29 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This money was spent to restore the damage caused by the gravel works, as well as to install a swing bridge which now is the only means of access, reducing the monument's exposure to vandalism. The mirrors are situated on an island within an [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds|RSPB]] nature reserve, and can only be accessed on open days as the designated site (which has both [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] and [[Special Protection Area]] status) is sensitive to disturbance.

'''Salva Kiir Mayardit''' (born 13 September 1951) is a [[Dinka people|Dinka]] [[South Sudan]]ese politician who has been [[List of Presidents of South Sudan|President of South Sudan]] since its independence in 2011. Prior to independence, he was President of the Government of Southern Sudan, as well as [[Vice President of Sudan|First Vice President of Sudan]], from 2005 to 2011.

== Early life ==
Kiir was born in 1951 into a pastoral Dinka family in village of Akon in the Awan-Chan Dinka community in [[Gogrial]] District, [[Warrap (state)|Warrap state]] as the eighth of nine children (six boys and three girls) in the family.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; His father,  Kuethpiny Thiik Atem (d. 2007), was a cattle herder who belongs to the Payum clan.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; Atem had three wives, Awiei Rou Wol, Adut Makuei Piol and Awien Akoon Deng, along with 16 children.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; Mayaardit's mother, Awiei Rou Wol Tong was a farmer, who belongs to the Payii clan.&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paanluelwel.com/2016/02/14/salva-kiir-mayaardit-the-joshua-of-south-sudan/|title=Salva Kiir Mayardit: The Joshua of South Sudan|author=Wël, PaanLuel|date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sudanese civil wars ==
[[File:Salva Kiir-3, by Stein Ove Korneliussen.jpg|thumb|left|Salva Kiir Mayardit in [[military uniform]]]]

In the late 1960s, Kiir joined the [[Anyanya]] battalion in the [[First Sudanese Civil War]]. By the time of the 1972 [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]], he was a low-ranking officer.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4738295.stm|title=Profile: Salva Kiir|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''|date=2 August 2005|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, when [[John Garang|Dr John Garang]] joined an army [[mutiny]] he had been sent to put down, Kiir and other Southern leaders joined the rebel [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement]] (SPLM) in the [[Second Sudanese Civil War|second civil war]]. Dr. Garang De Mabior had advanced military knowledge and experience from both the [[United States]] and the Sudan. Kiir was his Deputy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Douglas H.|authorlink=Douglas H. Johnson|year=2003|title=The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=|isbn=0-253-21584-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-PuCbRr4tcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Root+Causes+of+Sudan%27s+Civil+Wars&amp;ei=bRwhS92hF4jMlQSrtq3MCQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kiir eventually rose to head the SPLA, the SPLM's military wing when Dr. John Garang was killed in a helicopter crash. Rumours to remove Kiir from his post as SPLA Chief of Staff in 2004 nearly caused the organization to split.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==South Sudanese politics==
Following the signing of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] formally ending the war in January 2005, Dr. John Garang was sworn in as the Vice President of the Republic of Sudan. After the death of Dr. John Garang in a helicopter crash on 30 July 2005, Kiir was chosen to succeed to the post of First [[Vice President of Sudan]] and President of Southern Sudan. Before independence, Kiir was popular among the military wing of the SPLA/M for his loyalty to the vision of the SPLA/M throughout the liberation struggle and among those who do not trust the successive governments that have come and gone in the Sudan.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Comments by Kiir in October 2009 that the forthcoming independence referendum was a choice between being "a second class in your own country" or "a free person in your independent state" were expected to further strain political tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE59U1FT20091031|title=S. Sudan president makes first call for independence|publisher=''[[Reuters]]''|date=31 October 2009|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports in January 2010 that Kiir would not contest April elections for Sudanese president, but would focus on re-election as president of Southern Sudan were interpreted to mean that the SPLM priority was independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8468760.stm|title=Sudan would accept separation, says President Bashir|publisher=''BBC News|date=19 January 2010|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiir was re-elected with 93% of the vote in the [[Sudanese general election, 2010|2010 Sudanese election]]. Although the vote on both the national and sub-national level was criticized by democratic activists and international observers, the overwhelming margin of Kiir's re-election was noted by some media as being "Step One" in the process of secession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/world/africa/27sudan.html?hp|work=The New York Times|title=Bashir Wins Election as Sudan Edges Toward Split|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman|date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his re-election, [[Omar al-Bashir]] reappointed Kiir as the First Vice President of Sudan in accordance with the interim constitution.&lt;ref name="sudantribune"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article35230|title=Salva Kiir and Ali Osman appointed deputies of Sudan’s President|publisher=Sudan Tribune|date=29 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Sudanese voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence from [[Sudan]] in January 2011, with 98.83% of voters reportedly preferring to split from the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/01/30/pct-southern-sudan-vote-secession/|agency=FOX News|date=30 January 2011|accessdate=25 August 2011|title=Over 99 Percent in Southern Sudan Vote for Secession}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 July 2011, [[South Sudan]] became an independent state, with Kiir as its first president. Kiir positioned himself as a reformer, using his inaugural address to call for the South Sudanese people "to forgive, though we shall not forget" perceived injustices at the hands of the northern Sudanese over the preceding decades&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201107090061.html|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=25 August 2011|title=South Sudan: Salva Kiir Calls for Forgiveness As South Gains Independence}}&lt;/ref&gt; and announce a general amnesty for South Sudanese groups that had warred against the SPLM in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/Salva-Kiir-takes-oath-grants,39479|agency=Sudan Tribune|date=9 July 2011|accessdate=25 August 2011|title=Salva Kiir takes oath, grants amnesty to rebels}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, he publicly addressed members of the military and police to warn them that [[rape]], [[torture]], and other [[human rights violation]]s carried out by armed personnel would be considered criminal acts and prosecuted aggressively by the Ministry of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oyetimes.com/news/africa/12875-salva-kiir-warns-armed-south-sudan-forces-over-human-rights-abuse|title=Salva Kiir Warns Armed South Sudan Forces Over Human Rights Abuse|first=Waakhe Simon|last=Wadu|date=1 August 2011|accessdate=18 August 2011|agency=Oye! Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His presidency was characterized as a period of reconstruction, albeit one marred by with internal and foreign disputes. Among these were the [[Heglig Crisis]], which caused a border war with [[Sudan]], and an internal political crisis in which attempts were made to overthrow him.

===Domestic policy===
On 18 June 2013, Kiir issued an order lifting the immunity of two ministers in the national government pending investigations into an alleged corruption case in which they appeared to be implicated. He also issued an order suspending Cabinet Affairs Minister [[Deng Alor Kuol]] and Finance Minister [[Kosti Manibe Ngai]] from their duties during the entire duration of the probe. In July 2013, Kiir sacked his entire cabinet, including his vice president, [[Riek Machar]], ostensibly to reduce the size of government. However, Machar said that it was a step towards [[dictatorship]] and that he would challenge Kiir for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2013/07/20137287019670555.html|title=South Sudan gripped by power struggle - Africa|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also dismissed [[Taban Deng Gai]] as Governor of Unity State.
 
Kiir told Radio Netherlands Worldwide that [[homosexuality]] is not in the "character" of Southern Sudanese people. "It is not even something that anybody can talk about here in southern Sudan in particular. It is not there and if anybody wants to import or to export it to Sudan, it will not get the support and it will always be condemned by everybody," he said. He then went on the refer to homosexuality as a "mental disease" and a "bastion of Western immorality" &lt;ref name="RNW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.africanactivist.org/2010/08/south-sudan-president-condemns.html|title=South Sudan President Condemns Homosexuality|publisher=African Activist News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In December 2011, 6,000 [[Nuer people|Lou Nuer]] armed [[Child Soldiers|child soldiers]] attacked [[Murle people|Murle]] communities. According to investigations carried out by the UN, 800 people from both ethnic groups were killed between December 2011 and February 2012, while [[Woman|women]] and [[child]]ren were abducted and property was looted and destroyed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/south-sudan|title=World Report 2013: South Sudan|last=|first=|date=2013-01-10|website=Human Rights Watch|series=World Report 2013|publisher=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to large numbers of or the entire child soldier population, Kiir planned and had decided to agree to warlike stipends from the Obama administration beginning in 2012, regardless of an American law prohibiting aid to nations utilizing child soldiers created and passed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/06/09/hillary-clintons-state-department-gave-south-sudans-military-a-pass-for-its-child-soldiers/|title=Hillary Clinton's State Department Gave South Sudan's Military a Pass for Its Child Soldiers|last=Turse|first=Nick|date=June 9, 2016|website=The Intercept|series=New Nation, Long War|publisher=First Look Media|access-date=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A lack of [[accountability]] and [[justice]] pertaining to the [[Criminal investigation|investigation]], [[arrest]] and prosecution of the individuals who carried out the violence against [[civilian]]s of both the Nuer and Murle ethnic groups is widely believed to have contributed massively to, if not categorically, the  [[mass murder]]s, as well as the continued perpetration of the ethnic violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kiir established a [[figurehead]] "Investigation Committee" with an ostentatious [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] to investigate those responsible for the mass murders and [[murder]]s, but as of January 2013 no finances had been allocated to the "Investigation Committee" or any of its members sworn in to commence the investigation and bring those to [[justice]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Throughout the [[Jonglei]] [[disarmament]] "Operation Restore Peace" which began in March 2012 and continued throughout the year, soldiers were ordered to and assumed the responsibility of [[extrajudicial killing]]s, severe [[battery (crime)|beatings]], binding people with rope, and torture to [[Forced confession|extract "information"]] regarding the [[Misinformation|whereabouts of weapons]].

==== Consolidation of power ====

After rumors about a planned coup surfaced in Juba in late 2012, Kiir began reorganizing the senior leadership of his government, party and military on an unprecedented scale. In January 2013, he replaced the inspector general of the national police service with a lieutenant from the army, and dismissed six deputy chiefs of staff and 29 major generals in the army. In February 2013 Kiir retired an additional 117 army generals but this was viewed
as troublesome in regards to a power grab by others. Kiir had also suggested that his rivals were trying to revive the rifts that had provoked infighting in the 1990s.

==== Murder and torture of journalists ====
Moi Peter Julius, who was a political [[Journalist|reporter]] for a South Sudanese newspaper The Corporate, was found murdered late on the night of August 19, 2015 in a residential area of [[Juba]] after being shot twice from behind. His murder was committed three days after Kiir publicly and officially threatened journalists, stating that “freedom of the press does not mean that you work against your country. If anybody does not know that this country will kill people, we will demonstrate on them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globaljournalist.org/2015/08/south-sudan-reporter-killed-in-apparent-targeted-attack/|title=South Sudan reporter killed in apparent targeted attack - Global Journalist|last=Raskauskite|first=Zivile|date=2015-08-26|website=Global Journalist|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in 2015, five journalists by the names of Musa Mohamed (the director of the state-run radio station Raja FM), Adam Juma (reporter and presenter for Raja FM), Dalia Marko and Randa George (reporters for Raja FM), and Boutros Martin (a cameraman for the Western Bahr el Ghazal of South Sudan Television) had been murdered while traveling as part of a convoy, along with six other people. Tom Rhodes of the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] stated after the murders that "The murder of five journalists is a devastating attack on South Sudan's already beleaguered press corps," and that "We urge Western Bahr el Ghazal authorities to do their utmost to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice, and to ensure journalists are allowed to carry out their duties safely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2015/01/five-journalists-killed-when-gunmen-ambush-convoy-.php|title=Five journalists killed when gunmen ambush convoy in South Sudan - Committee to Protect Journalists|last=|first=|date=January 27, 2015|website=cpj.org|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists|access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, none of the parties responsible for ordering the murders or perpetrators of the crimes have been arrested, charged, or convicted.

===Foreign policy===

In mid-October 2011, Kiir announced South Sudan had applied for accession to the [[East African Community]]. He declared the EAC to be "at the centre of our hearts" due to its members' support of the South during the Sudanese civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busiweek.com/11/the-eac-issues/eac-news/1891-south-sudan-readies-for-eac-membership|title=South Sudan readies for EAC membership which was later rejected|publisher=Busiweek.com|date=2011-10-17|accessdate=2011-12-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021011844/http://www.busiweek.com/11/the-eac-issues/eac-news/1891-south-sudan-readies-for-eac-membership|archivedate=2011-10-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2011, Kiir [[Israel-South Sudan relations|visited]] Israel to thank it for its support during the [[First Sudanese Civil War]] in 1956–1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/12/20/183573.html|title=Al Arabiya, 12/20/2011|publisher=Alarabiya.net|date=|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and met with Israeli president [[Shimon Peres]] to discuss establishing an embassy in [[Jerusalem]], which would make South Sudan the only country to have one in that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Pipes|url=http://www.danielpipes.org/10486/south-sudan-israel-allies|title=South Sudan, Israel's New Ally|publisher=Daniel Pipes|date=|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the outbreak of the South Sudanese civil war, Salva Kiir delivered a speech in January 2014 lashing out at the United Nations and “so-called humanitarian organizations,” accusing them of supporting Riek Machar to try to overthrow him. He accused the UN of sheltering his enemies on their bases adding, “There is a problem with the international community, and it is something that people will have to thrash out with them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCJ9YWChiB0|accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Kiir's government organized a rally accusing the United Nations of colluding with anti-government forces. Protesters carried signs accusing the UN of arming anti-government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/south-sudan-peace-protesters-against-un/1868885.html|title=South Sudan Peace Protesters Rail Against UN|last=Rwakaringi|first=Mugume Davis|date=2014-03-14|work=Voice of America|access-date=2015-10-15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between Kiir's government and some erstwhile supporters deteriorated since the start of the civil war. He disclosed in an op-ed published in his name in the Washington Times in October 2015 that unnamed "international partners in peace" had threatened his government with sanctions, the withdrawal of aid support, and referrals to the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/11/salva-kiir-mayardit-south-sudan-worlds-youngest-na/|title=South Sudan: the world's youngest nation strives to build democracy|last=Kiir Mayardit|first=Salva|date=2015-10-11|work=Washington Times|access-date=2015-10-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heglig crisis and war with Sudan====
On 26 March 2012, the South Sudanese army attacked the [[Heglig]] oilfield, which is known also to the Dinka of the Unity state as [[Panthou]] a Dinka word for Heglig in Arabic, located between the border of the Sudanese state of [[South Kordofan]] and the South Sudanese state of [[Unity State|Unity]], triggering the [[Heglig Crisis]]. On 27 September, Kiir met Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and signed eight agreements in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia, which led the way to resume important oil exports and create a {{convert|6|mi|km|0|order=flip|adj=on}} demilitarised zone along their border. The agreements allow for the return of {{convert|350,000|oilbbl|L|order=flip|abbr=off}} of South Sudanese oil to the world market. In addition, the agreements include an understanding of the parameters to follow in regards to demarcating their border, an economic cooperation agreement and a deal to protect each other's citizens. Certain issues remain unsolved and future talks are scheduled to resolve them.

On 25 November 2012, South Sudan launched a formal complaint to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) against Sudan in the wake of aerial bombings carried out by the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) in parts of South Sudan's northern Bahr el Ghazal state, killing at least eight people and injuring an equal number. South Sudan treated the attack as a gross violation of the cooperation agreement the two country's leaders signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 27 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=25 November 2012|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201211250310.html|title=South Sudan: Juba to File Complaint to UN Security Council Over Khartoum Aggression|publisher=allAfrica.com|date=2012-11-25|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political crisis===
Tensions rose between Kiir and his former vice president [[Riek Machar]] in December 2013 in the lead-up to a meeting of the National Liberation Council (NLC) of the ruling SPLM party. After two days of NLC meetings, on the night of 15 December 2013 shooting erupted within Salva Kiir's Presidential Guards. The next day, Kiir denounced Machar and other senior SPLM officials for staging a failed coup against his government, a claim later denied by Machar and others. These events marked the start of the [[South Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name="southsudannation.com"&gt;{{Citation |title=It wasn’t a coup: Salva Kiir shot himself in the foot|url=http://www.southsudannation.com/it-wasnt-a-coup-salva-kiir-shot-himself-in-the-foot/|newspaper=South Sudan nation|accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy of alleged marriage to daughter of William Nyuon===
In a politically charged social issue, it has been claimed that Kiir secretly married the daughter of former comrade, the late  [[William Nyuon Bany]], an ethic Nuer and former leader of the SPLA. Allegedly, a traditional Dinka ceremony was conducted by his brothers. This led to strife between Kiir's eldest daughter and Aluel William Nyuon Bany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Nairobian|title=Battles rock Salva Kiir family in Nairobi|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/thenairobian/article/4998/battles-rock-salva-kiir-family-in-nairobi?pageNo=2|publisher=Standard Media Group|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kiir has not publicly commented on the allegation. According to media reports in Kenya, "Kiir's in-laws" have requested privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Nairobian|title="Our family life is private" Kiirs in-law says|url=http://newskenya.co.ke/news/latest/the-standard/-our-family-life-is-private-kiirs-in-law-says/ebl9k.465347|publisher=Standard Media|accessdate=2014-04-21|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422233128/http://newskenya.co.ke/news/latest/the-standard/-our-family-life-is-private-kiirs-in-law-says/ebl9k.465347|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assassination plot===
According to a Saudi Arabian diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks in June 2015, the Saudi Arabian embassy in Khartoum had previously alerted the Saudi government of an assassination plot against President Kiir by members of the Egyptian and Sudanese intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sudan Tribune|title=Egyptian intelligence coordinated with Khartoum to assassinate South Sudan's Kiir: cable|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article55401|accessdate=20 June 2015|publisher=Sudan Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business interests ===
Kiir is reported to be the owner or part-owner of ABMC Thai-South Sudan Construction Company Limited. According to a report by Radio Tamazuj, however, Kiir's shares are not held directly but may be concealed in the name of a close associate. Ties between Kiir and the company were denied by Kiir's spokesman Ateny Wek. The company was awarded at least $161 million in government roads contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/special-investigation-president-kiir-linked-multi-million-dollar-roads-contracts|title=Special investigation: President Kiir linked to multi-million dollar roads contracts|last=Radio Tamazuj|first=|date=2015-06-16|work=|access-date=2015-10-15|via=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112203546/https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/special-investigation-president-kiir-linked-multi-million-dollar-roads-contracts|archive-date=2016-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president's wife previously held shares in Yanyyom Mineral Water and Beverage Factory located in Juba. The factory took its name from Lake Yanyyom, located near the president's hometown Akon in Warrap State. Another owner of the factory was Garang Deng Aguer, a business magnate and former Governor of Northern Bahr al Ghazal State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/special-investigation-kiir-did-business-ex-ncp-governor|title=Special investigation: Kiir did business with ex-NCP governor|last=Radio Tamazuj|first=|date=2015-06-24|work=|access-date=2015-10-15|via=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131015539/https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/special-investigation-kiir-did-business-ex-ncp-governor|archive-date=2016-01-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stetson hat==
In 2006, when visiting the [[White House]], Kiir received a black [[stetson]] as a gift from the then-U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]. He reportedly liked it so much that he purchased several. He now seldom makes public appearances without his hat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foreign Policy|title=Where did Kiir get his ten-gallon hat?|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2011/09/26/where-did-kiir-get-his-ten-gallon-hat/|accessdate=2016-07-11|publisher=Foreign Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seniors Solidarity''' was a minor political party in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It was founded in November 2008, by John Wolfe following the Medical Card changes in the [[Fallout of the 2009 Irish government budget|2009 Budget]].

It announced it would stand candidates at the [[Irish local elections, 2009|2009 local elections]], all candidates being over the age of 60. John Wolfe stood in the [[Howth]]-[[Malahide]] local electoral area in [[Fingal County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fingal-independent.ie/news/john-wolfe-senior-solidarity-party-1744130.html|title=John Wolfe, Senior Solidarity Party|work=Fingal Independent|date=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 1,319 votes (5.9%) but was not elected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=2009L&amp;cons=1979|title=Local elections: 2009 – Howth-Malahide|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had hoped to run candidates at the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 general election]], but did not register to take part in national elections.

It was registered to contest local elections in [[Dublin]] including [[County Dublin]]. It has not contested any elections since 2009.

As of 2015, it is no longer a registered political party.

'''Socialist feminism''' rose in the 1960s and 1970s as an offshoot of the [[feminism|feminist movement]] and [[New Left]] that focuses upon the interconnectivity of the patriarchy and capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapovsky Kennedy|first=Elizabeth|year=2008|title=Socialist Feminism: What Difference Did It Make to the History of Women's Studies?|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7fa751b2-dc67-4a88-90cf-28338f91acf0@sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=102|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=34|issue=3|pages=|via=}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist feminists argue that [[Women's liberation|liberation]] can only be achieved by working to end both the [[economy|economic]] and [[culture|cultural]] sources of women's [[oppression]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Socialist-Feminism.html What is Socialist Feminism?], retrieved on May 28th 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Socialist feminism is a two-pronged theory that broadens [[Marxist feminism]]'s argument for the role of [[capitalism]] in the oppression of women and [[radical feminism]]'s theory of the role of [[gender]] and the [[patriarchy]]. Socialist feminists reject radical feminism's main claim that patriarchy is the only or primary source of oppression of women.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Ian. "Socialist Feminism."  ''A Dictionary of Critical Theory.'' Oxford Reference Online.  Oxford University Press.  Web. 20 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, socialist feminists assert that women are unable to be free due to their financial dependence on males. Women are subjects to the male rulers in capitalism due to an uneven balance in wealth.  They see economic dependence as the driving force of women's subjugation to men.  Further, socialist feminists see women's liberation as a necessary part of larger quest for social, economic and political justice. Socialist feminists attempted to integrate the fight for women's liberation with the struggle against other oppressive systems based on race, class or economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/socialist-feminism-vs-other-feminism-3528987|title=Socialist Feminism vs. Other Types of Feminism|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist feminism draws upon many concepts found in Marxism; such as a [[historical materialism|historical materialist]] point of view, which means that they relate their ideas to the material and historical conditions of people's lives. Socialist feminists thus consider how the sexism and gendered division of labor of each historical era is determined by the economic system of the time. Those conditions are largely expressed through capitalist and patriarchal relations. Socialist feminists, thus reject the Marxist notion that class and class struggle are the only defining aspects of history and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harriss|first=Kathryn|date=1989-01-01|title=New Alliances: Socialist-Feminism in the Eighties|jstor=1395089|journal=Feminist Review|issue=31|pages=34–54|doi=10.2307/1395089}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Marx asserted that when class oppression was overcome, gender oppression would vanish as well. According to socialist feminists, this view of gender oppression as a sub-class of class oppression is naive and much of the work of socialist feminists has gone towards specifying how gender and class work together to create distinct forms of oppression and privilege for women and men of each class. For example, they observe that women's class status is generally derivative of her husband's class or occupational status, e.g., a secretary that marries her boss assumes his class status.

In 1972, "[http://www.historyisaweapon.org/defcon1/chisocfem.html Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women's Movement]", which is believed to be the first publication to use the term "socialist feminism", was published; it was by the Hyde Park Chapter of the [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]] ([[Heather Booth]], Day Creamer, Susan Davis, Deb Dobbin, Robin Kaufman, and Tobey Klass).&lt;ref name="CWLUOver"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Margeret "Peg" Strobel |author2=Sue Davenport |year=1999 |title=The Chicago Women's Liberation Union: An Introduction |work=The CWLU Herstory Website |publisher=University of Illinois |url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUAbout/abdoc1.html |accessdate=25 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104090301/http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUAbout/abdoc1.html |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other socialist feminists, notably two long-lived [[United States|American]] organizations [[Radical Women]] and the [[Freedom Socialist Party]], point to the classic Marxist writings of [[Frederick Engels]] (''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'') and [[August Bebel]] (''Woman and Socialism'') as a powerful explanation of the link between gender oppression and class exploitation.

In the decades following the [[Cold War]], feminist writer and scholar Sarah Evans says that the socialist feminist movement has lost traction in the West due to a common narrative that associates socialism with totalitarianism and dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Elizabeth Lapovsky|date=2008|title=Socialist Feminism: What Difference Did It Make to the History of Women's Studies?|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20459218|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=34|issue=3|pages=497–525}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Anarcha-feminism ==
[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines [[anarchism]] with [[feminism]]. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary [[Coercion|coercive]] hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralized]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the [[anarchism|anarchist]] struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]]. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, L. Susan (1995). "Beyond Feminism: Anarchism and Human Freedom". Reinventing Anarchy, Again. San Francisco: AK Press. pp. 149–154. {{ISBN|978-1-873176-88-7}}. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]] opposed [[patriarchy]] and the way the law "subjects [women] to the absolute domination of the man". He argued that "[e]qual rights must belong to men and women" so that women can "become independent and be free to forge their own way of life". Bakunin foresaw the end of "the [[authoritarian]] [[juridical]] [[family]]" and "the full sexual freedom of women".&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;An Anarchist FAQ. [http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html What is Anarcha-Feminism?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002070938/http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html |date=October 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcha-feminism began with late 19th and early 20th century authors and theorists such as anarchist feminists [[Emma Goldman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] and [[Lucy Parsons]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar-Ortiz, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Spanish Civil War]], an anarcha-feminist group, {{lang|es|[[Mujeres Libres]]}} ("Free Women") linked to the {{lang|es|[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]]}}, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas,&lt;ref&gt;Ackelsberg.&lt;/ref&gt; while the prominent Spanish anarchist and feminist leader [[Federica Montseny]] held that the "emancipation of women would lead to a quicker realization of the social revolution" and that "the revolution against sexism would have to come from intellectual and militant 'future-women.' According to this Nietzschean concept of Federica Montseny's, women could realize through art and literature the need to revise their own roles."&lt;ref name="anarchonietzche"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://radicalarchives.org/2010/05/18/nietzsche-and-the-anarchists/ |title=Spencer Sunshine: "Nietzsche and the Anarchists" (2005) |work=Fifth Estate |volume=367 |pages=36–37 |publisher=radicalarchives.org |date=Winter 2004–2005 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Argentina [[Virginia Bolten]] is responsible for the publication of a newspaper called ''{{lang|es|[[La Voz de la Mujer]]}}'' ({{lang-en|The Woman's Voice}}), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901. A similar paper with the same name was reportedly published later in [[Montevideo]], which suggests that Bolten may also have founded and edited it  after her deportation.&lt;ref name="molyneux"&gt;{{cite book|last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "La Voz de la Mujer described itself as "dedicated to the advancement of Communist Anarchism". Its central theme was that of the multiple nature of women's oppression. An editorial asserted, "We believe that in present-day society nothing and nobody has a more wretched situation than unfortunate women." Women, they said, were doubly oppressed—by bourgeois society and by men. Its feminism can be seen from its attack on marriage and upon male power over women. Its contributors, like anarchist feminists elsewhere, developed a concept of oppression that focused on gender oppression. Marriage was a bourgeois institution which restricted women's freedom, including their sexual freedom. Marriages entered into without love, fidelity maintained through fear rather than desire, oppression of women by men they hated—all were seen as symptomatic of the coercion implied by the marriage contract. It was this alienation of the individual's will that the anarchist feminists deplored and sought to remedy, initially through free love and then, and more thoroughly, through social revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/no-god-no-boss-no-husband-world%E2%80%99s-first-anarcha-feminist-group |title=No God, No Boss, No Husband: The world's first Anarcha-Feminist group |publisher=Libcom.org |date=January 3, 2012 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], [[Mercedes Comaposada]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organization was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and [[social revolution]] and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. Flying day-care centres were set up in efforts to involve more women in union activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Aileen |last=O'Carroll |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html |title=Mujeres Libres: Women anarchists in the Spanish Revolution |publisher=Workers Solidarity |issue=54 |date=June 1998 |accessdate=2012-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926095452/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html |archivedate=2015-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] poet, militant [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[feminism|feminist]]. She is best known as one of the founders of ''[[Mujeres Libres]]'' and served in the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista]] (SIA). By 1919, she had been published in a variety of journals, including ''Los Quijotes'', ''Tableros'', ''Plural'', ''Manantial'' and ''La Gaceta Literaria''. Working under a male [[pen name]], she was able to explore [[lesbian]] themes&lt;ref&gt;"R. Fue una época transgresora, emergió el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero.

Writing in anarchist publications such as ''Earth and Freedom'', the ''White Magazine'' and ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Workers' Solidarity]]'', Lucía outlined her perspective as a feminist.

In the past decades two films have been produced about anarcha-feminism. ''[[Libertarias]]'' is a historical drama made in 1996 about the Spanish anarcha-feminist organization [[Mujeres Libres]]. In 2010 the Argentinian film ''Ni dios, ni patrón, ni marido'' was released which is centered on the story of anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] and her publishing of the newspaper ''La Voz de la Mujer'' (English: The Woman's Voice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinenacional.com/peliculas/index.php?pelicula=7005 |title="Ni Dios, Ni Patrón, Ni Marido" (2009) by Laura Mañá |publisher=Cinenacional.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLh8AX0tcY0 |title=Ni Dios, Ni Patron, Ni Marido - Trailer |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marxist feminism ==
[[File:Zetkin luxemburg1910.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Socialist feminist]] [[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], 1910]][[Marxist feminism]] is a sub-type of '''[[feminist theory]]''' which focuses on the social institutions of [[private property]] and [[capitalism]] to explain and criticize gender inequality and oppression. According to Marxist feminists, private property gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political and domestic struggle between the sexes, and is the root of women's oppression in the current social context.

Marxist feminism's foundation is laid by [[Friedrich Engels]] in his analysis of gender oppression in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State]]'' (1884). He argues that a woman's subordination is not a result of her biological disposition but of social relations, and that men's efforts to achieve their demands for control of women's labor and sexual faculties have gradually solidified and become institutionalized in the [[nuclear family]]. Through a Marxist [[historical materialism|historical]] perspective, Engels analyzes the widespread social phenomena associated with female sexual morality, such as fixation on [[virginity]] and sexual purity, incrimination and violent punishment of women who commit [[infidelity|adultery]], and demands that women be submissive to their husbands. Ultimately, Engels traces these phenomena to the recent development of exclusive  control of private property by the patriarchs of the rising slaveowner class in the ancient mode of production, and the attendant desire to ensure that their inheritance is passed only to their own offspring: chastity and fidelity are rewarded, says Engels, because they guarantee exclusive access to the sexual and reproductive faculty of women possessed by men from the property-owning class.

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, both [[Clara Zetkin]] and [[Eleanor Marx]] were against the [[demonization]] of men and supported a [[Proletarian|proletariat]] revolution that would overcome as many male&amp;ndash;female inequalities as possible.&lt;ref name=Stokes&gt;{{cite book |author=Stokes, John |title=Eleanor Marx (1855&amp;ndash;1898): Life, Work, Contacts |year=2000 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-0113-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their movement already had the most radical demands in women's equality, most Marxist leaders, including Clara Zetkin&lt;ref&gt;Zetkin, Clara, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1976/women/3-zetkin.html ''On a Bourgeois Feminist Petition''] (1895).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zetkin, Clara, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm ''Lenin On the Women's Question''].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexandra Kollontai]],&lt;ref&gt;Kollontai, Alexandra, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1909/social-basis.htm ''The Social Basis of the Woman Question''] (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kollontai, Alexandra, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1919/women-workers/ch01.htm ''Women Workers Struggle For Their Rights''] (1919).&lt;/ref&gt; counterposed Marxism against bourgeois feminism, rather than trying to combine them.

Orthodox Marxists argue that most Marxist forerunners claimed by feminists or "Marxist feminists" including Clara Zetkin&lt;ref&gt;Zetkin, Clara [http://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1976/women/3-zetkin.html On a Bourgeois Feminist Petition] 1895&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zetlen"&gt;Zetkin, Clara [http://www.marxists.org/archive/zetkin/1920/lenin/zetkin1.htm Lenin on the Women's Question]&lt;/ref&gt; and Alexandra Kollontai&lt;ref name="kol1"&gt;Kollontai, Alexandra [http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1909/social-basis.htm The Social Basis of the Woman Question] 1909&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kollontai, Alexandra [http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1919/women-workers/ch01.htm Women Workers Struggle For Their Rights] 1919&lt;/ref&gt; were against capitalist forms of feminism. They agreed with the main Marxist movement that feminism was a bourgeois ideology counterposed to Marxism and against the working class. Instead of feminism, the Marxists supported the more radical political program of liberating women through socialist revolution, with a special emphasis on work among women and in materially changing their conditions after the revolution. Orthodox Marxists view the later attempt to combine Marxism and feminism as a liberal creation of academics and reformist leftists who want to make alliances with bourgeois feminists. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For what reason, then, should the woman worker seek a union with the bourgeois feminists? Who, in actual fact, would stand to gain in the event of such an alliance? Certainly not the woman worker. —Alexandra Kollontai, 1909&lt;ref name="kol1"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A pioneering Marxist and feminist, [[Mary Inman]] of the [[Communist Party USA]] challenged the party's orthodox position by arguing that the home is a center of production and housewives carry out productive labor. Her writings include ''In Woman's Defense'' (1940) and ''Woman-Power'' (1942).&lt;ref name=Weigand30&gt;{{cite book |last= Weigand|first= Kate|date= 2001|title= Red Feminism: American Communism and the Making of Women's Liberation|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2S-a6fBuNsEC&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=%22mary%20inman%22&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= Baltimore, Maryland|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|page= 30|isbn= 9780801871115|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inman's work was at first warmly received by several top Communist women leaders, including [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] and [[Ella Reeve Bloor]], but the CPUSA leadership began an official attack on Inman's work for purported ideological deviation in 1941.&lt;ref name="EAL"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Gluck|first= Sherna Berger|author-link= |editor1-last= Buhle|editor1-first= Mari Jo|editor1-link= Mari Jo Buhle|editor2-last= Buhle|editor2-first= Paul|editor2-link= Paul Buhle|editor3-last= Georgakas|editor3-first= Dan|editor3-link= Dan Georgakas|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of the American Left|title= Mary Inman (1894–1985)|trans-title= |url= |access-date= |language= |edition= 1st|date= 1990|year= |publisher= Garland Publishing Co.|series= |volume= |location= New York|id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages= 361–362|quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of articles written against Inman's ideas appeared in the party's literary monthly, ''[[The New Masses]],'' and the polemic was extended with the publication of a pamphlet by A. Landy, ''Marxism and the Woman Question.''&lt;ref name="EAL"/&gt;

[[Radical Women]], a major Marxist-feminist organization, bases its theory on Marx' and Engels' analysis that the enslavement of women was the first building block of an economic system based on private property. They contend that elimination of the capitalist profit-driven economy will remove the motivation for sexism, racism, homophobia, and other forms of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;''The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure''[http://www.redletterpress.org/rwmanifesto.html], Red Letter Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-932323-11-1}}, pages 2–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Legacies of the insurgent sociologist'' in ''Enriching the Sociological Imagination: How Radical Sociology Changed the Discipline'', Brill Press, 2004, 978-9004139923, p8&lt;/ref&gt; Levine goes on to describe the book as "one of the earliest statements of how a [[Marxist]] [[class analysis]] can combine with a [[feminist analysis]] of [[patriarchy]] to produce a theory of how gender and class intersect as systems of inequality".&lt;ref name="Levine, Rhonda F. 2004, p8"/&gt;

"Eisenstein defines the term 'capitalist patriarchy' as descriptive of the 'mutually reinforcing dialectical relationship between capitalist class structure and hierarchical sexual structuring."&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, Deborah L. ''Feminist Theory and Literary Practice'', Pluto Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7453-1601-8}}, p193&lt;/ref&gt;

She believes that "The recognition of women as a sexual class lays the subversive quality of feminism for [[liberalism]] because liberalism is premised upon women's exclusion from public life on this very class basis. The demand for real equality of women with men, if taken to its logical conclusion, would dislodge the [[patriarchal]] structure necessary to a liberal society."&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein, ''Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism'', cited in ''Feminism and Philosophy: Essential Readings in Theory, Reinterpretation, and Application'', eds: Nancy Tuana, Rosemarie Tong, Westview Press 1995, {{ISBN|0-8133-2213-8}}, p5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Donna Haraway and "A Cyborg Manifesto"===
In 1985, Donna Haraway published the essay "[[A Cyborg Manifesto]]: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" in ''[[Socialist Review (US)|Socialist Review]]''. Although most of Haraway's earlier work was focused on emphasizing the masculine bias in scientific culture, she has also contributed greatly to feminist narratives of the twentieth century. For Haraway, the Manifesto came at a critical juncture at which feminists, in order to have any real-world significance, had to acknowledge their situatedness within what she terms the "informatics of domination".&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"&gt;Haraway, Donna. "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century." Stanford University. {{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html |archivedate=2012-02-14 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists must, she proclaims, unite behind "an ironic dream of a common language for women in the integrated circuit".&lt;ref name="stanford.edu"/&gt; Women were no longer on the outside along a hierarchy of privileged binaries but rather deeply imbued, exploited by and complicit within networked hegemony, and had to form their politics as such.&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, Sara L. "[http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T001&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchResultsType=MultiTab&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;docId=GALE%7CA207324511&amp;docType=Critical+essay&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;contentSegment=&amp;prodId=GLS&amp;contentSet=GALE%7 The cyborg coyote: generating theory in the borderlands]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}." ''Southwestern American Literature'', vol. 34, no. 2, 2009, p. 9+. ''Literature Resource Center''. Accessed 16 Mar. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Haraway's "Manifesto", "there is nothing about being female that naturally binds women together into a unified category. There is not even such a state as '[[being]]' female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices" (p.&amp;nbsp;155). A cyborg does not require a stable, essentialist identity, argues Haraway, and feminists should consider creating coalitions based on "affinity" instead of identity. To ground her argument, Haraway analyzes the phrase "women of color", suggesting it as one possible example of affinity politics. Using a term coined by theorist Chela Sandoval, Haraway writes that "oppositional consciousness" is comparable with a cyborg politics, because rather than identity it stresses how affinity comes as a result of "otherness, difference, and specificity" (p.&amp;nbsp;156).

=== Autonomist feminism ===
[[Leopoldina Fortunati]] is the author of ''The Arcane of Reproduction: Housework, Prostitution, Labor and Capital'' (''L'arcano della riproduzione: Casalinghe, prostitute, operai e capitale''), a feminist critique of Marx. Fortunati is the author of several books, including ''The Arcane of Reproduction'' (Autonomedia, 1995) and ''I mostri nell'immaginario'' (Angeli, 1995), and is the editor of ''Gli Italiani al telefono'' (Angeli, 1995) and ''Telecomunicando in Europa'' (1998), and with J. Katz and R. Riccini ''Mediating the Human Body. Technology, Communication and Fashion'' (2003).  Her influences include [[Mariarosa Dalla Costa]], [[Antonio Negri]], and [[Karl Marx]].

[[Silvia Federici]] is an Italian scholar, teacher, and activist from the radical [[Autonomism|autonomist]] [[feminist]] Marxist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=05/10/06/1324235&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=9 Silvia Frederici biography at ''Interactivist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000811/http://info.interactivist.net/article.pl?sid=05%2F10%2F06%2F1324235&amp;mode=nested&amp;tid=9 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federici's best known work, ''[[Caliban]] and the [[Sycorax|Witch]]: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation'', expands on the work of [[Leopoldina Fortunati]]. In it, she argues against [[Karl Marx]]'s claim that [[primitive accumulation]] is a necessary precursor for [[capitalism]]. Instead, she posits that primitive accumulation is a fundamental characteristic of capitalism itself—that capitalism, in order to perpetuate itself, requires a constant infusion of expropriated capital.

Federici connects this expropriation to women's unpaid labour, both connected to reproduction and otherwise, which she frames as a historical precondition to the rise of a capitalist economy predicated upon wage labor. Related to this, she outlines the historical struggle for [[the commons]] and the struggle for [[communalism]]. Instead of seeing capitalism as a liberatory defeat of [[feudalism]], Federici interprets the ascent of capitalism as a reactionary move to subvert the rising tide of communalism and to retain the basic social contract.

She situates the institutionalization of [[rape]] and [[prostitution]], as well as the [[Heresy|heretic]] and [[witch-hunt]] trials, burnings, and torture at the center of a methodical subjugation of women and appropriation of their labor. This is tied into colonial expropriation and provides a framework for understanding the work of the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[World Bank]], and other proxy institutions as engaging in a renewed cycle of primitive accumulation, by which everything held in common—from water, to seeds, to our genetic code—becomes privatized in what amounts to a new round of [[Field (agriculture)|enclosures]].

=== Material feminism ===

[[Material feminism]] highlights [[capitalism]] and [[patriarchy]] as central in understanding women's oppression. The theory centers on social change rather than seeking transformation within the capitalist system.&lt;ref name="Possible"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Jackson | first = Stevi | author-link = Stevi Jackson | title = Why a materialist feminism is (Still) Possible—and necessary | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]], special issue: Local/Global IDs: Materialist Discursive Feminism | volume = 24 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 283–293 | publisher = [[ScienceDirect]] | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(01)00187-X| date = May–August 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0277-5395(01)00187-X | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Wicke, defines Materialist Feminism as "a feminism that insists on examining the material conditions under which social arrangements, including those of [[gender]] hierarchy, develop... materialist feminism avoids seeing this gender hierarchy as the effect of a singular... patriarchy and instead gauges the web of social and psychic relations that make up a material, historical moment".&lt;ref name="Wicke, Jennifer 1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferguson | first = Margaret | title = Feminism and postmodernism | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham, NC | year = 1994 | isbn = 0822314886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that "...materialist feminism argues that material conditions of all sorts play a vital role in the social production of gender and assays the different ways in which women collaborate and participate in these productions".&lt;ref name="Wicke, Jennifer 1994"/&gt; Material feminism also considers how women and men of various races and ethnicities are kept in their lower economic status due to an imbalance of power that privileges those who already have privilege, thereby protecting the status quo.

The term Material feminism was first used in 1975 by [[Christine Delphy]].&lt;ref name="Chrys Ingraham p. 7"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hennessy | first = Rosemary | title = Materialist feminism : a reader in class, difference, and women's lives | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780415916349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current concept has its roots in socialist and [[Marxist feminism]]; Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham, editors of ''Materialist Feminism: A Reader in Class, Difference, and Women's Lives'', describe material feminism as the "conjuncture of several discourses—[[historical materialism]], Marxist and [[radical feminism]], as well as postmodernist and psychoanalytic theories of meaning and subjectivity".&lt;ref name="Chrys Ingraham p. 7"/&gt; he term materialist feminism emerged in the late 1970s and is associated with key thinkers, such as [[Rosemary Hennessy]], [[Stevi Jackson]] and [[Christine Delphy]].&lt;ref name="Possible" /&gt; Rosemary Hennessy traces the history of Materialist Feminism in the work of British and French feminists who preferred the term materialist feminism to [[Marxist feminism]].&lt;ref name="Discourse"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hennessy | first = Rosemary | title = Materialist feminism and the politics of discourse | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780415904803 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, Marxism had to be altered to be able to explain the sexual division of labor. Marxism was inadequate to the task because of its class bias and focus on production. [[Feminism]] was also problematic due to its essentialist and idealist concept of woman. Material Feminism then emerged as a positive substitute to both Marxism and feminism.&lt;ref name="Discourse" /&gt; Material Feminism partly originated from the work of French feminists, particularly [[Christine Delphy]]. She argued that materialism is the only theory of history that views [[oppression]] as a basic reality of women's lives. Christine Delphy states that this is why women and all oppressed groups need materialism to investigate their situation. For Christine Delphy "to start from oppression defines a materialist approach, oppression is a materialist concept."&lt;ref name="FemReview"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Delphy | first1 = Christine | last2 = Leonard | first2 = Diana | title = A Materialist Feminism is Possible | journal = Feminist Review | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–105 | doi = 10.1057/fr.1980.8 | date = March 1980 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/fr.1980.8 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She states that the domestic mode of production was the site of patriarchal exploitation and the material basis of the oppression of women. Christine Delphy further argued that [[marriage]] is a labor contract that gives men the right to exploit women.&lt;ref name="FemReview" /&gt; ''The Grand Domestic Revolution'' by [[Dolores Hayden]] is a reference. Hayden describes Material feminism at that time as reconceptualizing the relationship between the private household space and public space by presenting collective options to take the "burden" off women in regard to [[Homemaking|housework]], [[cooking]], and other traditional female domestic jobs.&lt;ref name="Spender"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kramarae | first1 = Cheris | last2 = Spender | first2 = Dale |

==Praxis==

Socialist feminists believe that women's liberation must be sought in conjunction with the social and economic justice of all people.  They see the fight to end male supremacy as key to social justice, but not the only issue, rather one of many forms of oppression that are mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Elizabeth Lapovsky|title=Socialist Feminism: What Difference Did It Make To The History Of Women's Studies?|journal=Feminist Studies|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicago Women's Liberation Union ===
The [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]], known colloquially as CWLU, was formed in 1969 after a founding conference in Palatine, Illinois. [[Naomi Weisstein]], [[Vivian Rothstein]], [[Heather Booth]], and Ruth Surgal were among the founders of it. The main goal of the organization was to end gender inequality and sexism, which the CWLU defined as "the systematic keeping down of women for the benefit of people in power".&lt;ref name="cwluherstory.org"&gt;[http://www.cwluherstory.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose statement of the organization expressed that "Changing women's position in society isn't going to be easy. It's going to require changes in expectations, jobs, child care, and education. It's going to change the distribution of power over the rest of us to all people sharing power and sharing in the decisions that affect our lives."&lt;ref name="cwluherstory.org"/&gt; The CWLU spent almost a decade organizing to challenge both sexism and class oppression.  The group is best known for the 1972 pamphlet "[http://www.historyisaweapon.org/defcon1/chisocfem.html Socialist Feminism: A Strategy for the Women's Movement]". Nationally circulated, the publication is believed to be the first to use the term socialist feminism.

The CWLU was organized as an umbrella organization to unite a wide range of work groups and discussion groups. A representative from each work group went to monthly meetings of the Steering Committee to reach consensus on organizational policy and strategy. They addressed a myriad of issues including women's health, reproductive rights, education, economic rights, visual arts and music, sports, lesbian liberation, and much more.

=== Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell ===
[[Women's International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell]] (W.I.T.C.H.) was the name of many related but independent [[Feminism|feminist]] groups formed in the [[United States]] during 1968 and 1969 and who were important in the development of socialist feminism. The name W.I.T.C.H. was also sometimes expanded as "Women Inspired to Tell their Collective History", "Women Interested in Toppling Consumer Holidays", and many other variations.&lt;ref name=brownmiller&gt;{{cite book|last=Brownmiller|first=Susan|authorlink=Susan Brownmiller|title=In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution |year=1999 |isbn=0-385-31486-8 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no centralized organization; each W.I.T.C.H. group was formed independently by women inspired by the ideas and example of previous actions. Their activism mainly took the form of "zaps", a form of [[guerrilla theater]] mixing [[street theatre]] and [[protest]], where they used attention-catching and humorous public actions to highlight political and economic complaints against companies and government agencies, frequently involving the use of [[witch]] costumes and the chanting of [[curse|hex]]es. Witches often appeared as stock characters in feminist Left theatre, representing the misogynist [[crone]] stereotype.

On [[Halloween]] 1968, women from W.I.T.C.H. staged a "[[curse|hex]]" of [[Wall Street]] at a branch of [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], wearing rags and fright makeup; [[Robin Morgan]] stated that the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] declined sharply the next day.&lt;ref name=brownmiller /&gt; The DJIA did not decline sharply, and experienced a rise over the next several days and weeks.&lt;ref name=dow&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Dow Jones Closing Prices 1961-1970|url=http://www.automationinformation.com/DJIA/dow_jones_closing_prices_1961_to_1970.htm|work=Automation Information|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731013723/http://www.automationinformation.com/DJIA/dow_jones_closing_prices_1961_to_1970.htm|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1968 W.I.T.C.H targeted both the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] and the [[Chicago Eight]], saying that they conspired to treat only men as "leaders" of the [[antiwar movement]]. In 1969, W.I.T.C.H. held a protest at a "Bridal Fair" at Madison Square Garden. Members wore black veils. They handed out pamphlets titled "Confront the Whoremakers", chanted "Here come the slaves/Off to their graves", and had a mock "unwedding" ceremony. The protests also involved turning loose several white mice at the event, which Fair attendees began scooping up off the ground. The event resulted in negative media coverage for W.I.T.C.H., and some dissention among members over goals and tactics.&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradley|first=Patricia|title=Mass Media and the Shaping of American Feminism, 1963-1975|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=9781578066131|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1970, the Washington [[coven]] (W.I.T.C.H. chapters were called "covens") held a protest during a Senate hearing on population control. They interrupted Texas Senator [[Ralph Yarborough]]'s testimony by chanting and throwing pills at panel members and people in the audience galleries.&lt;ref name="Bradley"/&gt; Spin-off "covens" were founded in [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref name=brownmiller /&gt; and W.I.T.C.H. zaps continued until roughly the beginning of 1970. The "zap" protests used by W.I.T.C.H. may have helped inspire the [[Zap (action)|zap action]] protest tactics adopted shortly afterwards by LGBT activists, and still in use.

=== Big Flame ===
[[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]] was "a revolutionary socialist feminist organisation with a working-class orientation"&lt;ref&gt;Archive Archie [http://bigflameuk.wordpress.com/about/ Big Flame 1970-1984: Who We Were] at wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sojourner"&gt;[http://www.sojournertruth.net/thompson.html Review of 'Reflections on Organising']&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United Kingdom]]. Founded in [[Liverpool]] in 1970, the group initially grew rapidly, with branches appearing in some other cities. Its publications emphasised that "a revolutionary party is necessary but Big Flame is not that party, nor is it the embryo of that party". The group was influenced by the Italian [[Lotta Continua]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Widgery]] ''The Left In Britain, 1956-1968'' Penguin,1976 (p. 479)&lt;/ref&gt;

The group published a magazine, ''Big Flame'', and a journal, ''Revolutionary Socialism''.&lt;ref name="moorhouse"&gt;John Moorhouse, ''A Historical Glossary of British Marxism'' (Pauper's Press, 1987) {{ISBN|0-946650-06-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were active at the Ford plants at [[Halewood]]  and [[Dagenham]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} and  devoted a great deal of time to self-analysis and considering their relationship with the larger [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] groups.  In time, they came to describe their politics as "[[libertarian Marxist]]".  In 1978 they joined the [[Socialist Unity (United Kingdom)|Socialist Unity]] [[electoral coalition]], led by the Trotskyist [[International Marxist Group]]. In 1980, the  [[anarchist]]s of the [[Libertarian Communist Group]] joined Big Flame.  The Revolutionary Marxist Current also joined at about this time.  However, as more members of the group defected to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], the journal ceased to appear in 1982,&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt; and the group was wound up in about 1984. Ex-members of the group were involved in the launch of the mass-market tabloid newspaper the ''[[News on Sunday]]'' in 1987, which folded the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Chippindale, Chris Horrie. Disaster: The Rise And Fall of News On Sunday - Anatomy of a Business Failure. 1988 {{ISBN|978-0747402305}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the group was taken from a television play, ''[[The Big Flame]]'' (1969), written by [[Jim Allen (playwright)|Jim Allen]] and directed by [[Ken Loach]] for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Wednesday Play]]'' season. It dealt with a fictional strike and [[work-in]] at the [[Liverpool]] Docks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/557251/ Big Flame, The (1969)] at Screenonline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intersectionality ==
Feminist historian [[Linda Gordon]] asserts that socialist feminism is inherently intersectional, at least to a certain degree, because it takes into account both gender and class. Gordon says that because the foundation of socialist feminism rests on multiple axes, socialist feminism has a history of intersectionality that can be traced back to a period decades before Dr. Kimberlé Crenshaw first articulated the concept of intersectionality in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Linda|date=2016-07-12|title=‘Intersectionality’, Socialist Feminism and Contemporary Activism: Musings by a Second-Wave Socialist Feminist|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0424.12211|journal=Gender &amp; History|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=340–357|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12211|issn=0953-5233}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gordon, socialist feminism of the 1980’s expanded upon the concept of intersectionality by examining the overlapping structures that instantiate oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Linda|date=2013|title=Socialist Feminism: The Legacy of the "Second Wave"|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24718484|journal=New Labor Forum|volume=22|issue=3|pages=20–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholar and women’s studies professor [[Elizabeth Lapovsky Kennedy]] says that this broader analysis of societal structures began with socialist feminism and served as a catalyst for feminist scholarship. Kennedy says that many of the first women’s studies programs were established by socialist feminist theorists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Despite the supposed presence of intersectionality in socialist feminism, many feminists, particularly women of color, critique the movement for perceived deficiencies in regards to racial equity. In Kennedy’s account of socialist feminism’s impact on women’s studies, she says that a lack of Black voices in feminist academia contributed to whitewashing of women’s studies programs and courses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Kum-Kum Bhavnani|Kum-Kum Bhavani]], a professor at University of California Santa Barbara, and Margaret Coulson, a socialist feminist scholar, assert that racism in the socialist feminist movement stems from the failure of many white feminists to recognize the institutional nature of racism. According to Bhavani and Coulson, race, class, and gender are inextricably linked, and the exclusion of any one of these factors from one’s worldview would result in an incomplete understanding of the systems of privilege and oppression they say constitute our society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhavnani|first=Kum-Kum|last2=Coulson|first2=Margaret|date=2005|title=Transforming Socialist-Feminism: The Challenge of Racism|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3874366|journal=Feminist Review|issue=80|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Harriss, a feminist scholar from the United Kingdom, describes what she sees as the shortcomings of the socialist feminist movement of the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Harriss describes marginalized women’s grievances with the [[Women's liberation movement|Women’s Liberation Movement]], a large socialist feminist group. She says many lesbian women criticized the movement for its domination by heterosexual feminists who perpetuated heterosexism in the movement. Similarly, Black women asserted that they were deprived a voice due to the overwhelming majority of white women in the WLM advocating widely held views regarding violence against women, the family, and reproductive rights that failed to account for the distinct struggles faced by women of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harriss|first=Kathryn|date=1989|title=New Alliances: Socialist-Feminism in the Eighties|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1395089|journal=Feminist Review|issue=31|pages=34–54|doi=10.2307/1395089}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Motherhood and the private sphere==

Socialist feminists highlight how motherhood and the gendered division of labor many assert grows "naturally" from women's role as mothers is the source of women's exclusion from the public sphere and creates women's economic dependence on men. They assert that there is nothing natural about the gendered division of labor and show that the expectation that women perform all or most [[reproductive labor]], i.e., labor associated with birthing and raising children but also the cleaning, cooking, and other tasks necessary to support human life, deny women the capacity to participate fully in economic activity outside the home.  
In order to free themselves from the conditions of work as a mother and housekeeper, socialist feminists such as [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] saw the professionalization of housework as key. This would be done by hiring professional nannies and housekeepers to take the load of domestic work away from the woman in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Perkins Gilman|first=Charlotte|title=Women and Economics|year=1898|publisher=Small, Maynard &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Perkins Gilman also recommended the redesign of homes in ways that would maximize their potential for creativity and leisure for women as well as men, i.e., emphasizing the need for rooms like studios and studies and eliminating kitchens and dining rooms.  These changes would necessitate the communalization of meal preparation and consumption outside the home and free women from their burden of providing meals on a house-by-house scale.

The '''socialist fraternal kiss''' or '''socialist fraternal embrace''' is a special form of greeting between the statesmen of [[Communist countries]]. This act demonstrates the special connection that exists between [[Socialist states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Photos: A History of Lip-Locking in Russia, Home of the "Socialist Fraternal Kiss"|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/lgbt/photos-a-history-of-kissing-in-russia/|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=Vocativ|date=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''socialist fraternal kiss'' consisted of an embrace, combined with a series of three kisses on alternate cheeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smale|first1=Alison|title=Romania Cool Toward Gorbachev's First Visit|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Romania-Cool-Toward-Gorbachev-s-First-Visit/id-15574d333fa314a1ed157fbeed22c097|agency=Associated Press|date=25 May 1987|quote=Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and President Nicolae Ceausescu, who has openly attacked recent Kremlin reforms, greeted each other warmly today as Gorbachev began his first visit to this maverick East bloc nation. The two leaders embraced and kissed each other three times on both cheeks.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, when the two leaders considered themselves exceptionally close, the kisses were given on the mouth rather than on the cheeks.&lt;ref name="New Statesman" /&gt;

The ''socialist fraternal embrace'' consists of a series of three deep hugs, alternating between the left and right sides of the body, without kissing.&lt;ref name=reuters2013&gt;{{cite av media| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbp_6Cau61I|title=Chinese Premier Li Keqiang begins Vietnam visit|agency=Reuters|date=13 October 2013|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; This modified greeting was adopted by Communist leaders in Asia, which lacks a tradition of [[cheek kissing]] as greeting. During the Cold War, Communist leaders in Asia consented to receive kisses from Europeans and Cubans, but they themselves omitted the kiss.

Since the end of Communism in eastern Europe, the socialist fraternal kiss has died out. However, the socialist fraternal embrace continues to be exchanged between Communist leaders in Asia. In addition, Cuba has also adopted the Asian form of the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese President Xi Jinping awarded Cuba's Jose Marti Medal|url=http://english.cntv.cn/2014/07/23/ARTI1406104195656906.shtml|agency=Xinhua|publisher=CCTV.com English|date=23 July 2014|quote=Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) hugs Cuban President Raul Castro after being awarded Cuba's Jose Marti Medal in Havana, capital of Cuba, July 22, 2014.

==History==

This ritual originated in the European practice of [[cheek kissing]] as a greeting between family members or close friends. It has also been associated with the [[Kiss#In_religion|Eastern Orthodox Fraternal- or Easter Kiss]],&lt;ref name="New Statesman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belton|first1=Padraig|last2=Citron|first2=Lana|title=The Politics of the Kiss|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2016/02/politics-kiss|accessdate=4 June 2017|work=New Statesman|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which through its entrenchment in the rites of the Orthodox Church carried a substantial strength of expression and so found use in daily life.

As a symbol of equality, fraternity and solidarity, the socialist fraternal kiss was the expression of the pathos and enthusiasm of the emergent [[Workers' movement]] between the middle and end of the 19th century. In the years after the [[October Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Communist International]], a ritualisation of the so far spontaneous gesture succeeded into an official greeting between Communist comrades. The symbolic reinforcement of the feeling of camaraderie also gained success through the fact that many Communists and Socialists had to make long, arduous and dangerous trips to then the isolated [[Bolshevik Russia]]. That way the much-experienced international Solidarity found expression in stormy embraces and kisses.

With the expansion of Communism after World War II, the Soviet Union was no longer isolated as the only Communist country.  The fraternal socialist kiss became a ritualised greeting among the leaders of Communist countries.  The greeting was also adopted by socialist leaders in the [[Third World]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Russian President Podgorny Greeted by President Kaunda | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8JVGg8poE0 | publisher=AP Archive | date=27 March 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez meets Chinese President Jiang Zemin | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiChC8TxLhw | publisher=AP Archive | date=24 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the leaders of socialist-aligned [[liberation movements]] such as the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]] and the [[African National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Forrest|title=Yasser Arafat &amp; Deng Xiaoping|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/chmn-deng-xiaoping-embracing-plo-chmn-yasser-arafat-during-news-photo/50460113|agency=Getty Images|date=5 October 1989|quote=Chmn.

==Kremlinology==

Some [[Kremlinology|Kremlinologists]] studying the USSR paid close attention to whether the fraternal embrace was exchanged between Communist leaders. The omission of the customary embrace is taken to indicate a lower level of relations between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Biers|first=Dan|title=Summit Stumper: Will Deng Hug Gorbachev?|agency=Associated Press|date=15 May 1989|quote=Will they or won't they? The big question when the tightly orchestrated Soviet-Chinese summit between Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping begins is whether the leaders will embrace to symbolically end 30 years of strained relations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, after the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the Chinese refused to embrace their Soviet counterparts or to address them as "comrade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Biers|first=Dan|title=Summit Stumper: Will Deng Hug Gorbachev?|agency=Associated Press|date=15 May 1989|quote=When Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visited Deng in Shanghai last February he received a warm and lengthy handshake, but no hug. Schevardnadze referred to the Chinese leader as "comrade," but the socialist honorific was not returned.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the normalization of relations in 1989, the Chinese continued to omit the fraternal embrace when greeting Soviet leaders, even as they exchanged the fraternal embrace with leaders from other Communist countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=National Technical Information Service|title=Daily Report: People's Republic of China|journal=United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service|date=1989|issue=20-29|quote=But the Chinese leader did not embrace Mr. Shevardnadze, as he usually does with visiting personalities from communist nations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to emphasize that Sino-Soviet relations were not returning to the level that they were in the 1950s, prior to the split; Chinese [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] specifically insisted on "handshake, no embrace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Radchenko|first1=Sergey|title=Unwanted visionaries: the Soviet failure in Asia at the end of the Cold War|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780199938773|page=166|quote=The main question of protocol, mulled over by the media, was whether Deng would bear-hug Gorbachev or offer him a handshake. This came under careful scrutiny of policy makers at the highest level. "Embracing might shock the world," Deng said with an eye to the West's reaction. Therefore, the Chinese protocol specifically provided for "handshake, no embrace" to highlight the new character of Sino-Soviet relations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reuters2013/&gt;

Because of its symbolic significance, Communist leaders will often exchange the fraternal embrace even if serious disagreements exist, to avoid giving the public impression that relations are strained. For example, although China and Vietnam dispute the ownership of the [[Spratly Islands]], Chinese and Vietnamese leaders continue to exchange the socialist fraternal embrace.&lt;ref name=reuters2013/&gt;

==Cheek kissing==

The socialist fraternal kiss should not be confused with ordinary [[cheek kissing]] between world leaders. For example, it is traditional for the President of France to greet world leaders by kissing them on both cheeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube | id=Ojy6HhrR90k | title= Arrivée en France du président Hu Jintao}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sarkozy and Merkel inject new life into alliance|url=http://www1.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/122/article_6760.asp|agency=Reuters|publisher=RFI English|date=4 February 2010|quote=French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel kissing at the Elysee Palace in Paris on 4 February}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a socialist fraternal kiss because there are only two kisses, and it carries no ideological meaning.  It is practiced by [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] presidents as well as [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] presidents.

==In popular culture==

The fraternal kiss became famous via [[Erich Honecker]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]], who were photographed exercising the ritual. The photograph became widespread and it was subsequently transformed into a graffiti painting on the [[Berlin Wall]] named ''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7650">The '''Songsuradet rebellion''' ([[Thai language|Thai:]] กบฏพระยาทรงสุรเดช; [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|RTGS:]] Kabot Phraya Songsuradet) also known as the '''Rebellion of 18 corpses''' ([[Thai language|Thai:]] กบฏ 18 ศพ) was an important [[Thailand|Thai]] historical event in 1939. '''Phraya Songsuradet''' ([[Thai language|Thai:]] พระยาทรงสุรเดช) actually did not instigate the [[rebellion]] or [[coup]] in any way yet it was named after him. The coup was in truth carried out by '''[[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Luang Phibulsonggram]]''' ([[Thai language|Thai:]] หลวงพิบูลสงคราม) or "Phibul" on 29 January 1939 to [[purge]] the country of his political enemies and former rivals (one of whom happened to be Songsuradet).

==Background ==
[[Image:Phraya Sonsuradet.jpg|thumb|left|Phraya Songsuradet, the Rebellion's namesake]]

Born in 1892 as '''Thep Panthumasen''' ([[Thai language|Thai:]] เทพ พันธุมเสน), Songsuradet was commissioned in the [[Royal Thai Army]] as an [[artillery]] [[lieutenant]] after graduating from the [[Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy]] and furthering his studies in [[Germany]] where he studied at the [[engineer]] school. He returned to [[Thailand]] in 1915. From then on he was given many responsibilities, especially in the construction of [[railway]]s. In 1932 he was given the title of '''Phraya Songsuradet''' by King [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII). He played a crucial role in the [[1932 Siamese coup d'état|Revolution of 1932]] and subsequently became an important member of the new Thai [[constitutional government]].

The roots of the [[rebellion]] began during the [[Siamese coup d'état of 1933|coup d'état of June 1933]], when [[Phot Phahonyothin|Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena]] ousted [[Phraya Manopakorn Nititada]] and replaced him as [[Prime Minister of Thailand|prime minister]]. Phraya Songsuradet a supporter of Phraya Mano, and many of his companions were barred from politics for life by the new premier. Songsuradet was exiled to [[Sri Lanka]] for two years. 

During, before, and after the coup, conflicts arose between Songsuradet and Phibulsonggram, who were both [[ministers of state]] and members of the [[Cabinet of Thailand|People’s Committee.]]

When Luang Phibulsonggram succeeded Phraya Phahon as [[Prime Minister of Thailand]] on 11 September 1938, there was much resistance to his premiership due to his [[dictator]]ial style and [[cronyism]]. This, coupled with his role in suppressing the [[Boworadet Rebellion]], resulted in three [[assassination]] attempts, two by gunmen and one by poisoning.

==The purge==
In 1938, Songsuradet, by then having retired from [[politics]] for five years (but not yet from the [[army]]) was commander of the military school in [[Chiang Mai]]. On 16 December he was commanding a military exercise by his students in [[Ratchaburi Province]], west of the capital. On that date he received orders from [[Bangkok]] stripping him of his command of all units as well as his rank and titles and forcing him to retire from the army without [[pension]]. He was also expelled from the country. Fearing death, Songsuradet complied, and with his [[aide-de-camp]], Captain Samruad Kanjonsit ([[Thai language|Thai:]] ร้อยเอกสำรวจ กาญจนสิทธิ์), he escaped to [[Cambodia]].&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed:  [[Image:Prince-Rangsit1.jpg|thumb|150px|Prince Rangsit of Chainat, one of the 'suspects']] --&gt;

The "rebellion", however, did not end there. In the early hours of 29 January 1939 Phibul, with the help of his [[minister of the interior]] and director of the [[Royal Thai Police]], ordered the arrest of a further 51 suspects (suspected of being Songsuradet sympathizers). The persons arrested included ''inter alia'' [[Rangsit, Prince of Chainat|Prince Rangsit, Prince of Chainat]] ([[Thai language|Thai:]] พระองค์เจ้ารังสิตประยูรศักดิ์) (a son of King [[Chulalongkorn]]), General [[Phraya Thepahatsadin]] ([[Thai language|Thai:]] พระยาเทพหัสดิน) (a 62-year-old former commander of the [[Siamese Expeditionary Force]] during the [[First World War]]), and [[Phraya Udom Pongphensawad]] ([[Thai language|Thai:]] พระยาอุดมพงศ์เพ็ญสวัสดิ์ ), a former minister of state. Others arrested included [[politicians]] such as members of the [[National Assembly of Thailand|People's Assembly]] and many were military officers and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s. A further 20 suspects were arrested by the end of the day, including one of Phibul's servants. 

A special [[tribunal]] was created by Phibul to try those purportedly involved in the so-called "rebellion" and the assassination attempts on Phibul. Seven were released for lack of evidence, 25 were imprisoned for life, and 21 were to be [[execution|executed]] by [[firing squad]]. However, three were [[pardon]]ed due to their honorable records and services to the nation. The three included Prince Rangsit and Phraya Thepahatsadin, who were instead imprisoned for life. The other 18, however did not share that fate. They were incarcerated at [[Bang Kwang Central Prison]]. Eventually they were executed by firing squad in installments of four prisoners a day.

==Aftermath==
Songsuradet, having escaped to [[Cambodia]], lived the rest of his life in abject poverty, making a living by selling [[confectionery]] in the streets of [[Phnom Penh]]. He died in 1944. Many of the other suspects who were imprisoned by Phibul were eventually pardoned by [[Khuang Abhaiwongse]] when he became prime minister in 1944.

The rebellion was in effect Phibul's own version of [[the Night of the Long Knives]]. By 1938 he had consolidated his power to such an extent that he had become virtual dictator of the country, changing the name of the country from "Siam" to "Thailand" in June 1938. He was able to accomplish this using brutal tactics and the absence of any credible opposition. [[Prajadhipok]] had by then been succeeded to the throne by [[Ananda Mahidol]], who was only 13 years old and studying in [[Switzerland]]. The tribunal which Phibul had set up to try the suspects was packed with judges appointed by he and his government. There were no lawyers present and no witnesses were called. Historians{{Who|date=July 2011}} agree today that the men executed were mostly innocent and were not a part of real plot to kill Phibul or overthrow his government. Phibul was eventually removed in 1944. Four years later he returned as prime minister from 1948–1957. He died in 1964.

'''''The Real Fidel Castro''''' is a biography of the Cuban revolutionary and politician [[Fidel Castro]], written by the British diplomat [[Leycester Coltman|Sir Leycester Coltman]] (1938–2003) and first published by [[Yale University Press]] in 2003. A diplomat for the government of the United Kingdom, Coltman had been appointed to the position of [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Cuba|British ambassador to Cuba]] from 1991 through to 1994, during which time he got to know Castro personally. He died shortly before his biography's publication.

The biography looks at Castro's life from its beginning up until the start of the 21st century, when Castro was in his final years of the presidency, a position that he would relinquish in 2008. The book is accompanied by anecdotes about Castro and his relationship with other politicians, supplied by Coltman from his years in the diplomatic service.

''The Real Fidel Castro'' was reviewed in the mainstream press in both the United Kingdom and United States.

He remains a figure from all our yesterdays, grey-bearded but eternally youthful, a man who effortlessly changed his slogan from "Socialism or death", suitable for the violent 20th century, to the more emollient "A better world is possible", appropriate for the more pacifistic revolutionaries of the present era."

}}
In a review published in the British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'', the journalist and historian [[Richard Gott]] noted that Coltman "has a good eye for detail and the telling anecdote" but at the same time, Gott felt that he "devotes rather too much space to Castro's early life, galloping though the 1990s about which his personal experience and insights might have been better deployed at greater length." Believing that the "stock-in-trade" of diplomats like Coltman was gossip, Gott felt that Coltman's work "repeats more stories about the love-lives of senior revolutionaries than I found interesting".&lt;ref name="Gott 2004"/&gt; Gott went on to compare Coltman's biography with one published around the same time, written by the German reporter Volker Skierka; he notes that "For the first time, we now have two full-length studies of the Cuban leader that reflect a European view. It makes a salutary change, and both diplomat and reporter have original things to say. Coltman's book is more measured, Skierka's more timely, yet neither strays far outside their specialist expertise."&lt;ref name="Gott 2004"/&gt;

| Semi-presidential republic
| style="text-align:center;"|2000&lt;ref group="note" name="C"&gt;Formerly a semi-presidential republic, it is now a parliamentary republic according to David Arter, First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University. In his "Scandinavian Politics Today" (Manchester University Press, revised 2008 {{ISBN|9780719078538}}), he quotes {{Cite journal | last = Nousiainen | first = Jaakko | title = From semi-presidentialism to parliamentary government: political and constitutional developments in Finland | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 95–109 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9477.00048 | date = June 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9477.00048 | ref = harv }} as follows: "There are hardly any grounds for the epithet 'semi-presidential'." Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: "The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitution reduced the powers of the president even further.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5194">'''Upward Spiral''' is a term used by [[Paul Kennedy]] in his book ''The Rise and Fall of Great Powers'' to describe the continually rising cost of military equipment relative to civilian manufactured goods. According to Kennedy there is an upward spiral at work in "all areas" of military production which is "becoming increasingly divergent from the commercial". The desire for state-of-the-art weaponry is meant to be pushing up the cost.&lt;ref name=Kennedy570-1&gt;Kennedy, 1989, pp. 570-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Writing in the late 1980s he said it was reasonable to assume that the next few decades would witness "the spiralling cost of the arms race, which is fuelled by the sheer expensiveness of newer weapons systems as well as by international rivalries."&lt;ref name=Kennedy570/&gt; Quoting the comment of [[Peter Mathias]] that "One of the few constancies in history... is that the scale of commitment on military spending has always risen"&lt;ref&gt;Mathias, 1969, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy argues that this has become more important with time. According to Kennedy, "if that was true for the wars and arms races of the eighteenth century, when weapons technology changed only slowly, it is much truer of the present century [20th], when each new generation of aircraft, warships and tanks is vastly more expensive than preceding ones, even when allowance is made for inflation."&lt;ref name=Kennedy570&gt;Kennedy, 1989, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy uses several examples. While a pre-1914 [[battleship]] cost the British [[admiralty]] 2.5 million pounds ( Taking inflation into account this would be approximately 56 million pounds in 1980 terms), by the 1980s 120 million pounds was needed to buy a replacement [[frigate]]. Another is that of the [[American Air Force|American]] [[B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit Stealth bomber]] whose cost rose into the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Kennedy570/&gt;

==Possible reasons==
Various possible reasons exist why military technology continues to rise in price. As military technologies are seldom if ever shared, each generation of technology requires each nation or group of nations to undertake long-term research programs independent of each other with no concrete knowledge of the weapons systems they will be expected to compete against, but with the knowledge that completing a project before competing nations will provide a considerable advantage, while falling behind could be disastrous. These factors combine to encourage very extensive research spending, even if results are never delivered. 

Secondly, military technologies are expected to have a long service life and to remain technologically competitive over the course of a decade or more. To achieve 'cutting-edge' technology at time of delivery (and thus technology that will still be relevant in some years time), the advances used are rarely mature technologies; this necessitates the use of custom-machined parts instead of off-the-shelf solutions. Within a few years, formerly cutting-edge solutions mature to become readily available at greatly reduced cost, but by this stage a system has already been delivered, and the next iteration of a system seeks to be more advanced than the currently available off-the-shelf systems. 

Thirdly, there are numerous technologies that are extremely expensive to develop and deploy, but once they are deployed by all nations, the relative value of the technology is significantly lowered. Advancements are extremely valuable when only one nation or power block possesses them, but once all nations have access to similar technologies, there is a requirement to deploy weapons that can defeat the original advance. This leaves the parties in much the same position as they were initially, while the cost of the platform will nevertheless have increased. This forms a cyclical arms race where unit prices continue to increase but the balance of power remains the same. Reactive tank armor resulted in a number of different advanced anti-tank munition (top attack, tandem charge, deplete uranium penetrators) with the end result that all new tanks are required to have both advanced armor and advanced munitions, but relative to each other are no more powerful.

Finally, many advancements increase the cost of a system but reduce the risk to platform and human lives. This increases costs in monetary terms, but provides very significant value that is not seen by observers. Technologies like stealth aircraft have been extremely expensive to develop and they only deploy the same munitions as conventional aircraft, which to observers can imply that the system cost is wasted. However, as they allow for missions to be successfully flown with far reduced risk to the aircraft, the net result can be better overall value even at higher cost.

The '''Vice-President of Zimbabwe''' is the second highest political position obtainable in [[Zimbabwe]]. Currently there is a provision for two Vice-Presidents, who are appointed by the [[President of Zimbabwe]]. The Vice-Presidents are designated as "First" and "Second" in the Constitution of Zimbabwe; the designation reflects their position in the presidential order of succession.

Under the ruling [[Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front|ZANU–PF]] party, the vice-presidential post ranked first in the order of succession has traditionally been reserved for a representative of the party's historical [[Zimbabwe African National Union|ZANU]] wing (mainly ethnic [[Shona people|Shona]]), while the other vice-presidential post has gone to a representative of the party's historical [[Zimbabwe African People's Union|ZAPU]] wing (mainly ethnic [[Northern Ndebele people|Northern Ndebele]]).
