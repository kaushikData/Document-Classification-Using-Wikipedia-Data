The '''Association of Moving Image Archivists''' ('''AMIA''') is a [[501(c)(3)]] [[Nonprofit#USA|not-for-profit]] organization established to advance the field of [[Film preservation|moving image archiving]] by fostering cooperation among individuals and organizations concerned with the acquisition, description, preservation, exhibition and use of moving image materials.

==History==
[[File:AMPAS PickfordCenter.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]'s [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]], 1313 N. [[Vine Street|Vine St.]], [[Hollywood]] - Home to the AMIA Office]]

Since the late 1960s, representatives from moving image archives have recognized the value of regular meetings to exchange practical information and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;For further information on the emergence of formal representation for the audiovisual preservation sector in the United States, see Anthony Slide, ''Nitrate Won't Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States'', Jefferson, NC, McFarland (1992), pp. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, this group of archivists originally known as the Film and Television Archives Advisory Committee (F/TAAC) expanded from a handful of participants to several hundred archivists from over 100 national, regional and local institutions. In 1990, the name of the group was changed to the Association of Moving Image Archivists. In 1991, AMIA voted to formalize as an individual-based member-based [[professional association]], the only one of its kind in the moving image archival field. Although AMIA's office is based in the US, its membership is now drawn from across the world.  Further information on the origins and history of AMIA can be found [http://www.amianet.org/about/mission here].&lt;ref&gt;See also Tom McGreevey and Joanne L. Yeck, ''Our Movie Heritage'', New Brunswick, NJ, Rutgers University Press (1997), pp. 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership is open to anyone who has an interest in the [[film preservation|preservation of moving images]] and associated sound recordings: in practice, most of the membership are professional [[archivist]]s (both [[public sector]] and [[Business|commercial]]) and people working in associated professions, e.g. [[librarian]]ship, the [[Film industry|film]] and [[television]] industry or [[Academia|academics]] in related fields.  AMIA offers both individual and institutional membership.

==Governing structure==
AMIA is governed by a [[Board of Directors]], which is elected by the membership on a two-year cycle, and chaired by a [[President#Non-governmental presidents|president]].  The Board oversees and ratifies the work of the sub-groups through which the work of the organization is undertaken.  The last significant changes to the governing structure were undertaken in 2009, when the present structure of committees and task forces was introduced.

===Current President===
* 2016-2017: Andrea Kalas

===Former Presidents===
* 2012-2015: Caroline Frick
* 2009-2011: Wendy Shay
* 2005-2009: Janice L. Simpson
* 2003-2005: [[Milt Shefter]]
* 1999-2003: Sam Kula
* 1997-1999: Linda Tadic
* 1996-1997: Andrea Kalas

* 1994-1995: Eddie Richmond
* 1993-1994: Ernest Dick
* 1992-1993: Chris Horak
* 1991-1992: Bill Murphy

===Committees and Task Forces===

AMIA is a volunteer based organization and projects rely on work done by its members in Committees and Task Forces.  More information about AMIA's Committees [http://www.amianet.org/community/committees can be found here].

* '''[[Committee]]s of the Board''' carry out the core management and policymaking functions of AMIA, e.g. running elections and organizing the conference.  Chairs are appointed directly by the Board of Directors, and although their members are volunteers drawn from within the wider AMIA membership, the rosters of Committees of the Board have to be approved by the Board.
* '''Committees of the Membership''' are the bodies through which AMIA's professional presence in the field exists.  They develop expertise, advocacy and education in the different topics and activities related to moving image archiving, e.g. preservation, copyright and cataloguing.  Their rosters are volunteers from within the AMIA membership, and they elect their chairs directly.
* '''[[task force|Task Forces]]''' are created by the Board of Directors to carry out a specific projects which does not fall squarely within the remit of an existing committee, and are dissolved on completion of that task.

==Activities==
[[File:AMIA conference 2006 audience.jpg|thumb|right|Delegates at the 2006 AMIA annual conference, held in [[Anchorage, Alaska]]]]

===Annual Conference===

AMIA's Festival of the Archives celebrates the work done by media archives in their efforts to preserve history and cultural heritage.  The festival offers attendees quality films that highlight preservation and restoration efforts a wide spectrum of archival materials - feature films, documentaries, animation, historical footage, and commercial video.  The inaugural festival was held in December, 2012 in conjunction with the SIFF Cinema Uptown in Seattle, Washington.

===E-mail Discussion List and Online Forum===
AMIA operates an [http://www.amianet.org/community/list-serv E-mail discussion list], known as AMIA-L to facilitate professional communication within the field.  Subscription is open to AMIA members and non-members, and is free of charge.  Topics that frequently arise in online discussion include [[News media|news stories]] and media coverage related to moving image archiving, technical issues, requests for information about specific films or [[Footage|archive footage]] for re-use in TV productions, [[copyright]] and media history in general.

'''Blason populaire''' is an umbrella [[genre]] in the field of [[folkloristics]] used to designate any item of any genre which makes use of [[stereotype]]s, usually, but not always, negative stereotypes, of a particular group.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Lindahl, John McNamara, John Lindow, eds. Medieval Folklore: A Guide to Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs. Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;"These stereotypes are manifested in a wide array of folkloric genres, including proverbs, other traditional sayings, nicknames, jokes, songs, rhymes, and football chants. All share a common function in that they are invoked to highlight positive aspects of the in-group by explicit auto-stereotyping or, alternatively, to identify the negative characteristics of out-groups. The explicit positive stereotyping of an in-group may often implicitly suggest negative characteristics of a rival out-group."&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. 'The Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material'. ''Folklore'' 124, 2 (2013): 157-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''blasons populaires''  nations are homogeneous and have national characteristics.

Items such as [[joke#ethnic jokes|ethnic jokes]] or [[joke#blonde jokes|blonde jokes]] are very common examples of blason populaire.

== ''Blasons Populaires'' in Irish Proverbial Material ==

The Irish proverbial material is almost devoid of any national blasons populaires, with the possible exception of the multi-group international comparison. These comparisons are often manifested in epigrammatic form in European languages, with the most salient and representative stereotypical trait being attributed to the nations involved (what Billig (1995) refers to as ‘banal nationalism’). Enumerative structures, usually tri- or quadripartite formulas, are the favoured apparatus. The syntactic and semantic juxtaposition of negative traits for comparative purposes is then counter-balanced by the positive representation of one nation, usually in final position, most commonly the in-group that invokes the comparison. Below is a nineteenth-century German example (Reinsberg-Düringsfeld 1863, 5) in which there is no apparent in-group.

::''Die Italiener fluchen, Die Franzosen schreien, Die Engländer essen, Die Spanier trotzen, Und die Deutschen betrinken sich.''	
:::( The Italians curse, the French scream, the English eat, the Spanish defy, and the Germans get drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Marcas Mac Coinnigh. An Blason Populaire: Slurs and Stereotypes in Irish Proverbial Material’. Folklore 125  (2013): 1&lt;/ref&gt; )

==''Blasons populaires'' in Wallonia and Luxembourg &lt;ref&gt;http://belgique-sud-surnoms-des-habitants.skynetblogs.be/&lt;/ref&gt;==

In [[Wallonia]] ([[Belgium]]) and [[Luxembourg]], the concept of "blason populaire" refers to a [[demonym]]-like [[nickname]] of the inhabitants of a village or a city.

''Blasons populaire'' come from the traditional languages ([[Walloon language|Walloon]], [[Luxembourgish]]). They are never translated in French, as opposed to the [[demonym]]s which exist in [[French language|French]] and in Walloon, often in two different constructions.

Some, which have lost their pejorative meaning, are now used to name restaurants, theater groups, communal houses, etc. They are also used in [[pseudonym]]s of writers in Walloon.

==''Blasons populaires'' in Picardie and Nord-Pas-de-Calais==

The inhabitants of all villages or cities in these regions have a ''blason populaire'' (in [[Picard language]]: ''surpitchet'').&lt;ref&gt;(in French):  André Accart, ''Les sobriquets des habitants du Pas-de-Calais'', 456  pages, ( 2006 ) {{ISBN|2-915800-05-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, for the town of [[Amiens]] the blason is ''chés Maqueus d'gueugues d'Anmien'' ('the Eaters of Walnuts of Amiens').  In 1597, Spanish soldiers mounted [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|a surprise attack]]. They were disguised as peasants and put walnuts at the doors of the town. The inhabitants were famished and opened the doors, following which the Spanish soldiers entered the city; with deadly consequences for the inhabitants.

'''''Bulfinch's Mythology''''' is a collection of [[general audience]] works by American [[Latinist]] and banker [[Thomas Bulfinch]], named after him and published after his death in 1867. The work was a highly successful popularization of [[Greek mythology]] for English-speaking readers. Carl J. Richard comments that it was "one of the most popular books ever published in the United States and the standard work on [[classical mythology]] for nearly a century," until the release of classicist [[Edith Hamilton]]'s 1942 ''[[Mythology (book)|Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0qAY29cYNxsC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=bulfinch’s+mythology+by+thomas+bulfinch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ew9fTYqwB8iCgAfYmuWKDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=bulfinch’s%20mythology%20by%20thomas%20bulfinch&amp;f=false Richard, Carl J., ''The Golden Age of the Classics in America,''] Harvard University Press, 2009, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a prose recounting of [[myth]]s and stories from three eras: Greek and [[Roman mythology]], [[King Arthur]] legends and [[chivalric romance|medieval romances]]. Bulfinch intersperses the stories with his own commentary, and with quotations from writings by his contemporaries that refer to the story under discussion. This combination of classical elements and modern literature was novel for his time.&lt;ref name="Miscuit"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060720010620/http://www.fivecolleges.edu/mcleary/cl-world.html Miscuit utile dulci: ''Bulfinch's Mythology'' as a pedagogical prototype] ''Classical World'', Vol. 78, No. 6 (1985), page 591, accessed 19 August 2015 via Wayback Machine&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulfinch expressly intended his work for the general reader. In the preface to ''The Age of Fable'' he states "Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation."&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, Thomas. 1934. ''The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes'', p. vii. Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulfinch originally published his work as three volumes: ''The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes'', published in 1855; ''The Age of Chivalry, or Legends of King Arthur'', published in 1858; and ''Legends of Charlemagne, or Romance of the Middle Ages,'' published in 1863. The original three volumes were later combined into a single volume titled ''Bulfinch's Mythology'', published in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sgg2AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=bulfinch’s+mythology+by+thomas+bulfinch&amp;dq=bulfinch’s+mythology+by+thomas+bulfinch&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kRBfTcurA83qgQeX-NyJDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgo ''Guide to Reference Books'', 1929, page 89]&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the [[public domain]], multiple editions of the combined work are still in print more than 150 years after the three books were published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5812">'''DanceAbility International''' is a dance company that trains inclusive dance teachers worldwide, as well as offering Youth Outreach and education programs, and performances. DanceAbility promotes [[contemporary dance]] performance that mixes able and disabled dancers in the same performances. This dance genre is often called "inclusive dance", "MixedAbility" or "[[physically integrated dance]]".

According to the Mission Statement of DanceAbility International, "The work of DanceAbility International helps decrease prejudice and misconceptions about diversity in the field of dance, and by extension in society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.danceability.com/index.php|publisher=DanceAbility International|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
DanceAbility trains its dancers using improvisation techniques, mainly [[Contact Improvisation]]. This is "a forum in which able and disabled dancers learn to move together".&lt;ref name="Bertens-1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Postmodernism: Theory and Literary Practice|year=1997|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027234452|pages=154–5|editor=Bertens, Johannes Willem and Douwe Fokkema}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alessi has described Contact Improvisation as a technique that evolved 

{{quote|from an experiment to a method with a very specific approach for any combination of people [...] At first, I thought inclusion was the issue, but the real problem for people with most kinds of disabilities is not inclusion but isolation. So we teach that every person can make movement and any part of a person’s body can express emotion—this form of dance is a heightened ability to communicate. It’s about not labeling, about creating language.&lt;ref name="Bjornstad-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bjornstad |first=Randi |title=Freedom to Move, Oregon Life |url=http://projects.registerguard.com/web/livinglifestyles/27111172-41/dance-alessi-alito-danceability-dancing.html.csp |accessdate=July 16, 2012 |newspaper=The Register Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |date=November 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527172659/http://projects.registerguard.com/web/livinglifestyles/27111172-41/dance-alessi-alito-danceability-dancing.html.csp |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alessi has said that he was greatly influenced in his career by the experience of growing up with family members with disabilities: "I have three immediate relatives with disabilities—my mother was quadriplegic following a traffic accident when I was 7, my sister had polio, and my uncle had what I call 'unique mental capabilities'". Alessi was also influenced by the dance cultures of the various [[inner city|inner cities]] he was exposed to while moving often as a child.&lt;ref name="Bjornstad-2011"/&gt;

==Programmes==
Dancers who have worked with DanceAbility include Alito Alessi, Emery Blackwell, Karen Nelson, Scott Smith, and Charlene Curtis.&lt;ref name="Bertens-1997"/&gt; Alessi launched DanceAbility with Karen Nelson in 1987, after reading an article about Contact Improvisation in [[Contact Quarterly]] dance and improvisation journal. DanceAbility began as a project of the [[Joint Forces Dance Company]], giving a workshop on Contact Improvisation. DanceAbility became an international project beginning with workshops in Germany in 1991; teachers of inclusive and contemporary dance from several countries participated in DanceAbility gatherings annually during the early 1990s in [[Eugene, Oregon]].&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.danceability.com/history.php|publisher=DanceAbility International|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of DanceAbility, the majority of inclusive dance teachers were self-taught. DanceAbility offered teacher certification in 1997. Teacher training remains one of its core projects. Teacher training is now given in several countries, including:
* the United States ([[Eugene, Oregon]])
* [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]
* [[Milan, Italy]]
* [[Amsterdam, Netherlands]]
* [[Trier, Germany]]
* [[Vienna, Austria]] (at ImPulsTanz Festival)
* [[Helsinki, Finland]]

Following a major donation in 2007 from Marisa De Leon, founder of a school for children with disabilities in [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], DanceAbility International has expanded into Latin America. Workshops have been held in [[Mexico City]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Puerto Madryn]], [[São Paulo]], and [[Montevideo]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

DanceAbility International has been the subject of three documentaries:
* ''Common Ground''
* ''All Bodies Speak''
* ''Joy Lab Research''
Alessi's writing on the topic of Contact Improvisation has appeared in [[Contact Quarterly]] dance journal, and in ''Dance, Human Rights, and Social Justice—Dignity in Motion'', edited by Naomi Jackson and Toni Shapiro-Phim.&lt;ref name="JFD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artistic Director Biography|url=http://www.jointforcesdance.com/bioAlito.php|publisher=Joint Forces Dance|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth Outreach==
Alessi has performed with a partner in a wheelchair since 1995, exposing tens of thousands of children to physically integrated dance. Performances have been held in North, Central, and South America, Europe and Asia.&lt;ref name="JFD"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1571">'''Diffuse design''' refers to the designing capability of individuals who are not formally trained as [[Designer|designers]]. Drawing on the natural human ability to adopt a design approach, nonexpert designers bring diffuse design into the world via a combination of [[Critical thinking|critical sense]], [[creativity]], and [[Pragmatism|practical sense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manzini|first=Ezio|date=2015-01-02|title=Design in the transition phase: a new design culture for the emerging design|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F14487136.2015.1085683|journal=Design Philosophy Papers|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=57–62|doi=10.1080/14487136.2015.1085683|issn=1448-7136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diffuse design was coined by Italian design scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] and was a central theme of his 2015 book ''Design, When Everybody Designs''. Manzini asserts that everybody is endowed with the ability to design, though not everyone is a competent designer and fewer still become professional designers. He also suggests it is the role of expert designers in [[social innovation]] contexts to improve the conditions by which different [[social actors]] can take part in [[co-design]] processes in a more expert fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2012}}
'''Ecstasy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ἔκστασις ''ekstasis'', "to be or stand outside oneself, a removal to elsewhere" from ''ek-'' "out," and ''stasis'' "a stand, or a standoff of forces") is a term used in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]], [[Christian philosophy|Christian]] and [[Existential philosophy|Existential]] philosophy. The different traditions using the concept have radically different perspectives.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
According to [[Plotinus]], ecstasy is the culmination of human possibility. He contrasted emanation (πρόοδος, ''prohodos'') from the [[Henology|One]]—on the one hand—with ecstasy or reversion (ἐπιστροφή, ''epistrophe'') back to the One—on the other.

This is a form of ecstasy described as the vision of, or union with, some otherworldly entity (see [[religious ecstasy]])—a form of ecstasy that pertains to an individual trancelike experience of the sacred or of God.

==Christian mysticism==
[[File:Estasi di Santa Teresa.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Ecstasy of Saint Teresa'', 1652, by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]]]]
Among the [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystics]], [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], [[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Teresa of Ávila]] had mystical experiences of ecstasy, or talked about ecstatic visions of God.

==Existential philosophy==

The term is currently used in philosophy usually to mean "outside-itself". One's consciousness, for example, is not self-enclosed, as  one can be conscious of an [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] person, who falls well outside one's own self. In a sense consciousness is usually, "outside itself," in that its object (what it thinks about, or perceives) is not itself. This is in contrast to the term '''[[wiktionary:enstasis|enstasis]]''' which means from "standing-within-oneself" which relates to [[theoria|contemplation]] from the perspective of a speculator.&lt;ref&gt;J. Glenn Friesen, [http://www.members.shaw.ca/aevum/Enstasy.pdf "Enstasy, Ecstasy and Religious Self-reflection"], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of enstasis gives way to the example of the use of the "ecstasy" as that one can be "outside of oneself" with time. In temporalizing, each of the following: the past (the 'having-been'), the future (the 'not-yet') and the present (the 'making-present') are the "outside of itself" of each other. The term ecstasy ({{lang-de|Ekstase}}) has been used in this sense by [[Martin Heidegger]] who, in his ''[[Being and Time]]'' of 1927, argued that our [[being-in-the-world]] is usually focused toward some person, task, or the past (see also [[existence]] and ''[[Dasein]]''). Telling someone to "remain in the present" could then be self-contradictory, if the present only emerged as the "outside itself" of future possibilities (our projection; ''{{lang|de|Entwurf}}'') and past facts (our [[Facticity#Heidegger|thrownness]]; ''{{lang|de|Geworfenheit}}'').&lt;ref&gt;As [[existentialist]] scholar [[Alphonso Lingis]] writes: "Existential philosophy defined the new concepts of ecstasy or of transcendence to fix a distinct kind of being that is by casting itself out of its own given place and time, without dissipating, because at each moment it projects itself — or, more exactly, a variant of itself — into another place and time. Such a being is not ideality, defined as intuitable or reconstitutable anywhere and at any moment. ''Ex-istence,'' understood etymologically, is not so much a state or a stance as a movement, which is by conceiving a divergence from itself or a potentiality of itself and casting itself into that divergence with all that it is." —Lingis, Alphonso. "The Imperative," Indiana University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emmanuel Levinas]] disagreed with Heidegger's position regarding ecstasy and existential temporality from the perspective of the experience of insomnia.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin, Dachun Yang, Linyu Gu (eds), [https://books.google.com/books?id=p3y64bw5kr8C&amp;dq= ''Levinas: Chinese and Western Perspectives''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Levinas talked of the Other in terms of 'insomnia' and 'wakefulness'.&lt;ref&gt;A-T. Tymieniecka (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iGONF4dUwOwC&amp;dq= ''Phenomenology World Wide''], Springer, 2003, p. 421.&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized the absolute otherness of the Other and established a social relationship between the Other and one's self.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin ''et al'' (eds), 2009, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he asserted that ecstasy, or exteriority toward the Other, forever remains beyond any attempt at full capture; this otherness is interminable or infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Sociality is a "relation ... to the infinite" (E. Levinas, ''Le temps et l'autre'', Presses universitaires de France, 1991, p. 8). The "relation with the Other" [''rapport à autrui''] is one among the "inevitable articulations of the transcendence of time" [''articulations ... inévitables de la transcendance du temps''] which are "neither ecstasy where the Same is absorbed in(to) the Other nor knowledge where the Other belongs to the Same" [''ni extase où le Même s'absorbe dans l'Autre ni savoir où l'Autre appartient au Même''] (''ibid''., p. 13).&lt;/ref&gt; This "infiniteness" of the Other would allow Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy as secondary to this ethic. Levinas writes:
{{quote|text=The others that obsess me in the other do not affect me as examples of the same genus united with my neighbor by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block... The others concern me from the first. Here fraternity precedes the commonness of a [[genus]]. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others.&lt;ref&gt;E. Levinas, ''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'', 1981, Springer, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other uses of the term==
The term 'ecstasy' is also used concomitantly by philosophers to refer to a heightened state of pleasure or area of consciousness that may have been ignored by other theorists; to sexual experiences with another person, or as a general state of intense emotional [[ecstasy (emotion)|rapture]]. These may include [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], intense consciousness toward another, or extraordinary physical connections to others.

'''Elisabeth Thuillier''' (fl. 1890s-1920s) was a French colourist who ran a workshop in Paris where her employees [[Film colorization#Hand colorization|hand-coloured]] early films and photographic slides using her plans and colour choices. She is remembered especially for the work she did for the director [[Georges Méliès]].

== Colourist ==
Thuillier had experience in colouring slides for [[magic lantern]]s, and in other kinds of photographic and colour work. Her workforce had started colouring film by 1897.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; This cinematic work was still new and it was given last place in the following description of her exhibit for the Paris ''[[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]'' in 1900. Its length reflects the importance of Thuillier's business.&lt;ref name=Toulet&gt;{{citation|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5446181q/f8.image|language=French|first=Emmanuelle|last=Toulet|title=Le cinéma à l'Exposition universelle de 1900|journal=Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine|volume=XXXIII|date=April 1986|pages=182–183|quote=Couleurs et coloris. Matières premières colorantes. Photographies négatives et positives, sur papier, sur verre, sur soie, sur cuir, sur parchemin celluloïd. Épreuves stéréoscopiques sur verres, et vues à projections en couleurs. Photochromie et photographies artistiques en couleurs. Coloris de films pour cinématographe.|jstor=20529217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Colours and colouring. Raw materials for tinting. Negative and positive photographs, on paper, on glass, on silk, on leather, on celluloid parchment. Stereoscopic prints on glass, coloured slides. Photochromy and artistic colour photographs. Film colouring for cinematography.''&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Exposition'' jury awarded her a bronze medal.&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt;

Thuillier hired more than 200 employees, all women, to handle the film commissions her workshop undertook. In a 1929 interview, she recollected spending her nights selecting colours and trying out samples.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Thuillier described her colours for film as "fine" [[aniline dye]]s, creating transparent and luminous tones. These dyes were dissolved first in water and then in alcohol. Each colourist was assigned a single tone, tinting specific parts of each frame before passing the film on to the next worker, in [[assembly line]] fashion.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Some areas to be coloured were so small that a paintbrush containing only a single horsehair was used.&lt;ref name=Kizirian/&gt;

Thuillier and her workers probably used four basic dyes: orange, a cyan-like blue-green, magenta, and bright yellow. These could be mixed to create other colours. The tones produced also changed depending the shade of grey of the film underneath.&lt;ref name=Essai&gt;{{citation|chapter=Avertissement|last1=Malthête-Méliès|first1=Madeleine|last2=Quévrain|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Malthête|first3=Jacques|pages=5–11|title=Essai de reconstitution du catalogue français de la Star-Film; suivi d'une analyse catalographique des films de Georges Méliès recensés en France|location=Bois d'Arcy|publisher=Service des archives du film du Centre national de la cinématographie|year=1981|isbn=2903053073|oclc=10506429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some films used more than twenty distinct colours, and all the work was done by hand.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{citation|first=François|last=Mazeline|journal=L'Ami du Peuple|date=13 December 1929|title=Mme Thullier nous rappelle… le temps où le cinéma ne manquait pas de couleurs}}. Quoted in {{citation|first=Georges|last=Mélies|title=Allocution au gala Méliès|date=October 1982|journal=Les dossiers de la cinémathèque|pages=34–36|url=http://collections.cinematheque.qc.ca/en/articles/allocution-au-gala-melies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop was at 87 Rue du Bac, Paris.&lt;ref name=Images&gt;{{citation|first1=André|last1=Gaudreault|first2=Germain|last2=Lacasse|first3=Jean-Pierre|last3=Sirois-Trahan|journal=24 images|issue=78-79|pages=79-84|year=1995|title=À Montréal, des sujets hauts en couleur, dès 1897...|url=https://www.erudit.org/culture/images1058019/images1082512/24302ac.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thuillier's recollections, her studio typically produced about 60 coloured copies of each film they took on. For 300 metres of hand-coloured film, the cost was about 6 or 7 thousand francs per copy.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

== Clients ==
[[File:Trip to the Moon Selenite on Shell.jpg|thumb|Restoration of original hand-coloured frame from Méliès' ''Trip to the Moon'']]
Thuillier handled all colouring work on Méliès' films from 1897 to 1912.&lt;ref name=Yumibe/&gt; Thuillier's work on Méliès's films was international; for example, the American distribution company [[Selig Polyscope]] negotiated with Méliès to have its prints shipped to France to be coloured by Thuillier's workers.&lt;ref name=Kizirian&gt;{{citation|title=The Color of Silents|first=Shari|last=Kizirian|work=Keyframe|publisher=[[Fandor.com]]|url=https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/the-color-of-silents|accessdate=17 June 2016|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her business was also used by [[Pathé]], but she called off an agreement to work exclusively for them when she realised she would have to share authority with a Mme. Florimond whose husband was a key employee there.&lt;ref name=Yumibe&gt;{{citation|last=Yumibe|first=Joshua|title=Moving Color: Early Film, Mass Culture, Modernism|location=New Brunswick, NJ|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2012|pages=84, 166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpvymkXtt1AC&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another customer was experimental film-maker [[Raoul Grimoin-Sanson]].&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

The pioneering director [[Segundo de Chomón]] was not a client but was introduced to Thuillier's techniques of hand-colouring through his wife [[Julienne Mathieu]]. Mathieu (Mme. Chaumont or Chomón) had worked in the Thuillier workshop, as a supervisor according to some sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.larevuedesressources.org/des-tresors-de-films-dans-le-domaine-public-europa-film-treasures,2479.html|title=Des trésors de films dans le domaine public. Europa Film Treasures|work=La Revue des Ressources|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as acting in silent movies. Chomón soon moved on to adding colour with stencils.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

== Later life ==
Thuillier's hand-painting proved to be a slow, expensive way of colouring reels of film, and the world of cinema moved towards using stencils instead of freehand colouring; this was more efficient for multiple copies.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{citation|last=Yumibe|first=Joshua|chapter=French Film Colorists|editor-first1=Jane|editor-last1=Gaines|editor-first2=Radha|editor-last2=Vatsal|editor-first3=Monica|editor-last3=Dall'Asta|title=Women Film Pioneers Project|publisher=Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, Columbia University Libraries|year=2013|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/essay/french-film-colorists|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last client for Thuillier's colouring techniques was [[Georges Dufayel]],&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; whose impressive department store ''Grands Magasins Dufayel'' housed a cinema and other attractions. In her 1929 interview, Thuillier expressed regrets about the disappearance of her craft.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

In December 1929, she was invited to a gala given in Méliès' honour at [[Salle Pleyel]].&lt;ref name=Melies/&gt; Several films were shown, including ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. For this event, "extremely delicate" colour restoration work was undertaken by two of Thuillier's "pupils", according to ''Cinéa'' magazine. Since the original negatives had been destroyed, the women removed the colour from old positive copies of the films, made new negatives, then new positives, and re-coloured those.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=L'Activité cinégraphique|journal=Cinéa|date=15 December 1929|page=26|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5739062d/f25.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Thuillier remarked to the press that if she had had sufficient time, she would have done the work herself.)&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Méliès introduced her in his speech at the gala as an "eminent artist" who did her work with a "remarkable talent".&lt;ref name=Melies&gt;{{citation|first=Georges|last=Mélies|title=Allocution au gala Méliès|date=October 1982|journal=Les dossiers de la cinémathèque|pages=34–36|url=http://collections.cinematheque.qc.ca/en/articles/allocution-au-gala-melies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The audience applauded and called "bravo".&lt;ref name=mage&gt;{{citation|first1=Maurice|last1=Bessy|first2=Lo|last2=Duca|title=Georges Méliès, mage|location=Paris|publisher=Prisma|year=1945|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Thuillier's non-professional life. On her business letterheads she was Mme. B. Thuillier,&lt;ref name=Images/&gt; and was described as a widow around 1900.&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt; In the 1920s she withdrew from Paris to "the provinces".&lt;ref name=mage/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}
'''Etiology''' ({{IPAc-en|iː|t|i|ˈ|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}; alternatively '''aetiology''' or '''ætiology''') is the study of [[Causality|causation]], or origination. The word is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|αἰτιολογία}}, ''aitiología'', "giving a reason for" ({{lang|grc|αἰτία}}, ''aitía'', "cause"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logía]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Aetiology | work = Oxford English Dictionary | edition = 2nd | year = 2002 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-521942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More completely, etiology is the study of the causes, origins, or reasons behind the way that things are, or the way they function, or it can refer to the causes themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{AHDict|etiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is commonly used in [[medicine]], (where it is a branch of medicine studying causes of disease) and in [[philosophy]], but also in [[physics]], [[psychology]], [[Forms of government|government]], [[geography]], [[spatial analysis]], [[theology]], and [[biology]], in reference to the causes or origins of various [[phenomena]].

In the past, when many physical phenomena were not well understood or when histories were not recorded, [[myth]]s often arose to provide etiologies. Thus, an etiological myth, or [[origin myth]], is a myth that has arisen, been told over time or written to explain the origins of various social or natural phenomena. For example, [[Virgil]]'s [[Aenead]] is a [[national myth]] written to explain and glorify the origins of the [[Roman Empire]]. In [[theology]], many religions have [[creation myths]] explaining the origins of the world or its relationship to believers.

==Medicine==
{{Main|Cause (medicine)}}
In medicine, the etiology of an illness or condition refers to the frequent studies to determine one or more  factors that come together to cause the illness. Relatedly, when disease is widespread, [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies investigate what associated factors, such as location, sex, exposure to chemicals, and many others, make a population more or less likely to have an illness, condition, or disease, thus helping determine its etiology. Sometimes determining etiology is an imprecise process. In the past, the etiology of a common sailor's disease, [[scurvy]] was long unknown. When large, ocean-going ships were built, sailors began to put to sea for long periods of time, and often lacked fresh fruit and vegetables. Without knowing the precise cause, [[Captain Cook|Captain James Cook]] suspected scurvy was caused by the lack of vegetables in the diet.  Based on his suspicion, he forced his crew to eat [[sauerkraut]], a cabbage preparation, every day, and based upon the positive outcomes, he [[inferred]] that it prevented scurvy, even though he did not know precisely why. It took about another two hundred years to discover the precise etiology: the lack of [[vitamin C]] in a sailor's diet.

== Mythology ==
{{Main|Origin myth}}
An etiological myth, or origin myth, is a [[mythology|myth]] intended to explain the origins of cult practices, natural phenomena, proper names and the like. For example, the name [[Delphi]] and its associated deity, ''[[Apollo|Apollon Delphinios]]'', are explained in the [[Homeric Hymn]] which tells of how Apollo, in the shape of a [[dolphin]] (''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphis}}''),  propelled [[Crete|Cretans]] over the seas to make them his priests. While Delphi is actually related to the word ''{{lang|grc-Latn|delphus}}'' ("womb"), many etiological myths are similarly based on [[folk etymology]] (the term "[[Amazons|Amazon]]", for example). In the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (published circa 17 BC), [[Virgil]] claims the descent of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Julian clan]] from the hero [[Aeneas]] through his son [[Ascanius]], also called Iulus. The story of [[Prometheus]]' sacrifice [[trick at Mecone]] in [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' relates how Prometheus tricked [[Zeus]] into choosing the bones and fat of the first sacrificial animal rather than the meat to justify why, after a sacrifice, the Greeks offered the bones wrapped in fat to the gods while keeping the meat for themselves. In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Pyramus and Thisbe]]'', the origin of the color of mulberries is explained, as the white berries become stained red from the blood gushing forth from their double suicide.

'''George Eugeniou''' (born June 1931) is a Cypriot actor, director and writer. He is the founder and artistic director of Theatro Technis in London, England, which was established in 1957.

==Early life and career==

George Eugeniou was born in [[Limassol]], [[Cyprus]]. He came to London in 1950 to study theatre with the support of his eldest sister, Loula Ionnides, and her family.

He trained at [[Morley College]], where he met Frank Drew, who gave him free lessons in diction and voice. With Drew's help, Eugeniou received a scholarship at the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]], where he won a Spotlight and a Webber Cup awards for his acting abilities.

In 1954 he joined [[Dundee Repertory Theatre]] company in Scotland as assistant stage manager, while also performing small parts. Then, he returned to London and joined a Cypriot amateur group under the auspices of The Cypriot Brotherhood with Paul Stasino, Anna Koutayiar and Theo Moreas. One year later he joined Sir [[Donald Wolfit]]'s company which was performing the play ''The Strong are Lonely'', touring all the major cities of England ending at [[Piccadilly Theatre]] first and then at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]. In 1956, he joined [[Joan Littlewood]]'s Theatre Workshop in [[Stratford East]] with several productions, including ''[[The Quare Fellow]]'' by [[Brendan Behan]].

==Theatro Technis==

In 1957, Eugeniou founded Theatro Technis, which was neither commercial nor subsidised, with the help of a group of actors, workers and students, including Andreas Markou, Stelios Kyriacou, Medea O'Brennon, Andy Lysandrou and [[Spyros Kyprianou]]. Theatro Technis can be defined as a "radical and total" theatre as Eugeniou's philosophy is to break barriers between nationalities, religions, genders, sexual orientations, classes, ages and languages.

Eugeniou has totally dedicated himself to Theatro Technis, abandoning his career as a mainstream actor, apart from a few movies in the 1950s and '60s. As Theatro Technis' artistic director he devised, directed and acted in numerous productions, often inspired by Cypriot or Greek artists and events. He was among the first to produce plays written or acted by black personalities such as Mark Heath, Harcourt Nichols, and Peter Blackman. Eugeniou has helped hundreds of student from all over London and abroad, proposing work-experiences or internships, free of charge. His passion for alternative theatre remains a common thread in his work as he always believes that the creative spirit is not for sale.
[[File:Theatro Technis, Crowndale Road - geograph.org.uk - 675198.jpg|thumb|Theatro Technis, Crowndale Road - geograph.org.uk - 675198]]
Still marked by his Cypriot accent, Eugeniou staged a production of [[Aristophanes]]' famous satires, as ''Women in Parliament'', in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/women-in-parlia-theatre-technis-8907 Howard Loxton, "Women in Parliament – Aristophanes, translated by G Theodorides, Theatro Technis, Camden", British Theatre Guide.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Help to the Cypriot community==

In 1967, he initiated the Cyprus Week, an annual festival to highlight the Cypriot culture and way of life in the United Kingdom and to create a greater awareness of the struggle of [[Cyprus]] against British colonialism and [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]]. He is also one of the founders of the [[National Federation of Cypriots]] in England, an umbrella organisation of more than one hundred Cypriot organisations.

In 1968, he created the first Cypriot Advisory Service in the United Kingdoms, which has helped thousands of Cypriot migrants and refugees receive welfare benefits, education, or housing. He also instigated and helped build the Cyprus Villages Housing in partnership with St Pancras Housing Association in the late 1980s. This "from life to art to life" philosophy is a cornerstone of his work.

==Personal life==

In 1969, George Eugeniou married Maroulla Sekkides, who became an actress with Theatro Technis. They have a son Aris, who is also dedicated to the theatre.

[[File:Del sarto Battesimo della gente.jpg|thumb|270px|''Battesimo della gente'', one of [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s gray and brown grisaille [[fresco]]es in the Chiostro dello Scalzo, [[Florence]] (1511-26).]]

A '''grisaille''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|aɪ}} or {{IPAc-en|ɡ|r|ᵻ|ˈ|z|eɪ|l}}; {{lang-fr|gris}} {{IPA-fr|ɡʁizaj|}} 'grey') is a [[painting]] executed entirely in shades of grey or of another neutral greyish colour.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'', 3rd edition, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly used in large decorative schemes in imitation of sculpture. Many grisailles include a slightly wider colour range, like the [[Andrea del Sarto]] fresco illustrated. Paintings executed in brown are referred to as [[brunaille]], and paintings executed in green are called [[verdaille]].&lt;ref&gt;Christie’s, ''Sale 1380, Old Master Paintings'', lot 49, New York, Christie’s, 17 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A grisaille may be executed for its own sake, as [[underpainting]] for an [[oil painting]] (in preparation for glazing layers of colour over it), or as a [[Physical model|model]] for an [[engraver]] to work from. "Rubens and his school sometimes use monochrome techniques in sketching compositions for engravers."&lt;ref&gt;'''Oxford Companion to Art.''' Ed. Harold Osborne; Clarendon Press. Oxford, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Full colouring of a subject makes many more demands of an artist, and working in grisaille was often chosen as being quicker and cheaper, although the effect was sometimes deliberately chosen for aesthetic reasons. Grisaille paintings resemble the [[drawing]]s, normally in monochrome, that artists from the Renaissance on were trained to produce; like drawings they can also betray the hand of a less talented assistant more easily than a fully coloured painting.

==History==
[[File:Hans Memling 016.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Hans Memling]] wing, with [[donor portrait]] in colour below grisaille Madonna imitating sculpture.]]
[[Giotto]] used grisaille in the lower registers of his frescoes in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], and [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]] and their successors painted grisaille figures on the outsides of the wings of [[triptych]]s, including the [[Ghent Altarpiece]]. Originally these were the sides on display for most of the time, as the doors were normally kept closed except on feast days or at the (paid) request of tourists. However today these images are often invisible in museums when the tryptych is displayed open and flat against a wall. In these cases imitation of sculpture was intended; sculpture was still more expensive than a painting even by a top master.

[[Illuminated manuscript]]s had often been produced in pen and [[watercolour|wash]] with a very limited colour range, and many artists such as [[Jean Pucelle]] and [[Matthew Paris]] specialised in such work, which had been especially common in England since [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] times. Renaissance artists such as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]] often used grisaille as a classicising effect, either in imitation of the effect of a classical [[sculpture]]d relief, or of [[Ancient Roman art|Roman painting]].

In the Low Countries a continuous tradition of grisaille paintings can be traced from [[Early Netherlandish painting]] to [[Martin Heemskerck]], [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] (''[[Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery (Bruegel)|Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery]]'') and [[Hendrik Goltzius]], and through the copious output of [[Adriaen van de Venne]], to the circle of [[Rembrandt]], and [[Jan van Goyen]].

The ceiling [[fresco]]es of the [[Sistine Chapel]] have portions of the design in grisaille, as does the lower part of the great staircase decoration by [[Antonio Verrio]] at [[Hampton Court]].

=== Modern examples ===

Grisaille, while less widespread in the 20th Century, continues as an artistic technique. [[Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso's]] painting ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' is one contemporary example.

[[Hugo Bastidas]] is a contemporary American painter known for black and white paintings that imitate the effect of grisaille and often resemble black and white photographs.&lt;ref name = carvalho&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Carvalho|first1=Denise|title=Hugo Bastidas at Nohra Haime|magazine=Art in America|date=April 2008|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bastidas’ paintings frequently reference architecture, water, vegetation and art history, and reflect his concern about [[The Human Condition|the human condition]], [[globalization]], and their effect on the Earth’s well-being.&lt;ref name = gallerybio&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.nohrahaimegallery.com/hugo-bastidas.html|publisher=Nohra Haime Gallery|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to New York from a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] in his native Ecuador in the early 1990s, Bastidas began using a restricted color palette of black and white.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt; His medium- and large-scale paintings allude to black-and-white photography, and feature contrasting zones of high and low detail.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dawson|first1=Jessica|title=Without Hue: A Rainbow of Grays|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/12/14/without-hue-a-rainbow-of-grays/23de1b30-cba4-4f12-bb05-bd11f9fda6ac/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making thousands of marks with a size No. 1 hog's bristle brush on linen primed with rabbit-skin glue, Bastidas achieves a high level of image definition.&lt;ref name = carvalho/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bardier|first1=Laura|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=http://www.artealdia.com/International/Contents/Reviews/Hugo_Bastidas|publisher=Arte Al Dia|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also works in digital photography, which informs his subject matter without rendering a [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hugo Bastidas|url=https://www.mattmuseum.org/exhibition/hugo-bastidas/|publisher=Mattatuck Museum|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic study==
With the 20th century's emphasis on direct (''[[alla prima]]'') painting, the grisaille technique lost favour with artists of the period. This historic method is still incorporated into the curriculum of some private [[studio|ateliers]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, at The Contemporary Realist Academy, in Memphis, Tennessee, The Ryder Studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico and Ecole Albert Defois in France.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In enamel and stained glass==
[[File:Magi Herod MNMA Cl23532.jpg|thumb|140px|Grisaille stained glass (15th century)]]
The term is also applied to monochrome painting in other media such as [[vitreous enamel|enamels]], where an effect similar to a [[relief]] in silver may be intended. It is common in [[stained glass]], where the need for sections in different colours was thereby greatly reduced. Portions of a window may be done in grisaille — using, for example, [[silver stain]] or vitreous paint — while other sections are done in coloured glass.

'''Halsted Church''' stands in the little village of Halsted some 6&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Nakskov]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]]. Dating from the second half of the 12th century, the church has a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[chancel]] and [[nave]], a large burial chapel from 1636 and a tower from 1877. The church was closely associated with [[Halsted Priory]], which has not survived.&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://www.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_0593-0620.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Halsted Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt'', Volume 8 (Nationalmuseet, 1951), pages 593-620. {{da icon}} Retrieved 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The granite church is first mentioned in 1177. It is therefore older than Halsted Kloster, the [[Benedictine]] priory with which it was associated from the 13th century until 1536. The church was dedicated to [[Sampson the Hospitable|St Samson of Constantinople]]. In 1177, the Crown's clerical appointment rights were transferred by [[Valdemar I of Denmark|King Valdemar]] to [[Ringsted Abbey]], which continued to have responsibility over Halsted Priory. At the time of the [[Danish Reformation|Reformation]], ownership returned to the Crown, which retained it until 1719 when it was transferred to ]]Jens Juel-Vind]] in exchange for [[Juellinge]] on [[Zealand]]. It was subsequently owned by members of the Juel-Vind family. After the barony was dissolved in 1921, the church came under ownership of the adjoining main building, named Halsted Kloster.&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt; In 1987, Mogens-Krag-Juel-Vind-Frijs returned ownership to the church itself.&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

==Architecture==
The church was originally a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building with a [[nave]], [[chancel]], [[apse]] and possibly a tower. Remains of the chancel and nave survive in the masonry of today's structure. When it became the priory church at the end of the 13th century, the chancel was extended to the east, its three-sided gable replacing the former apse. The church formed the northern wing of a four-winged priory of which nothing remains today. In 1510, the [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeckers]] burnt down the abbey, probably also destroying the church's Romanesque tower. During the 16th century the church was extended towards the west. A low tower was built at the west end and was rebuilt in the 1870s. In 1636, Borkvard Rud obtained rights to build the north chapel as a burial chapel for the owners of nearly [[Sæbyholm]]. The church was fully restored from 1868 to 1877.&lt;ref name=nk&gt;[http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/Halsted_kirke/Halsted_kirke.htm "Halsted klosterkirke"], ''Nordens kirker''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 25 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=beskrivelse&gt;[http://halsted-kirke.dk/?location=2&amp;page=164&amp;subpage=78 "Beskrivelse"], Halsted Kirke. {{da icon}} Retrieved 25 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Halsted Kirke interior02.jpg|thumb|The 15th-century triptych altarpiece]]
[[File:Halsted Kirke interior05.jpg|thumb|Jørgen Ringnis auricular pulpit (1636)]]
Vaults were introduced at the beginning of the 16th century, with three cross-vaults in the nave, two star-shaped vaults in the chancel and a five-sectioned vault at the end of the chancel. The late 15th-century [[altarpiece]] is a Gothic [[triptych]] with a scene of the crucifixion in the centre and saints and apostles on the two wings. The [[auricular style|auricular]] chancel screen from 1671 with the 11 apostles and Christ's baptism was probably crafted by [[Henrik Werner]]. A Baroque altarpiece which crowned the altar from 1750 to 1877, when it was replaced by the 15th-century work, can now be seen on the north wall of the chancel. The auricular [[pulpit]] (1636), displaying representations of [[Saints Faith, Hope and Charity|Faith, Hope and Charity]] as well as the arms of [[Christian V of Denmark|Prince Christian]] and Princess Magdalene Sibylle, is the work of [[Jørgen Ringnis]]. The font from c. 1750 is probably from the same workshop as the Baroque altarpiece.&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;&lt;ref name=beskrivelse/&gt;

'''Henrietta Hodson''' (26 March 1841 – 30 October 1910) was an English actress and theatre manager best known for her portrayal of comedy roles in the [[Victorian era]].  She had a long affair with the journalist-turned-politician [[Henry Labouchère]], later marrying him.

==Biography==
Hodson was born at Upper Marsh in St Mary's parish, [[Westminster]], London. She was the eldest daughter of George Alfred Hodson (1822–1869), an Irish-born comedian, singer and innkeeper, and Henrietta Elizabeth Noel, an actress and singer. Her two sisters, Kate (later Mrs Charles Henry Fenton, but known on stage as Kate Gordon) and Sylvia (Mrs J. Stripling Blythe), were also actresses. Hodson's cousin was the theatre producer [[George Musgrove]].&lt;ref&gt;Gittins, Jean. [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogMu-My.html#musgrove1 "Musgrove, George (1854–1916)"], Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1974, accessed 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===
Hodson made her first professional stage appearance at the Theatre Royal, [[Glasgow]], in 1858. In 1860, she and [[Henry Irving]] worked together in [[Manchester]] in ''The Spy, or, A Government Appointment''.  She joined J. H. Chute's Bath and Bristol companies in 1861 and built a reputation as a popular soubrette and [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] actress.  An 1883 ''[[New York Times]]'' article calls her "the cleverest [[Aladdin]] in [[H. J. Byron]]'s piece I remember to have seen."&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/01/17/106245396.pdf "London Facts and Gossips"], ''The New York Times'', 17 January 1883&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, at the Theatre Royal in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, she played the role of [[Oberon]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' under the management of [[Madge Kendal|Madge Robertson]] (later Mrs Kendal), who also starred in the play, and [[Ellen Terry]].  There she also played the title role in the burlesque ''Endymion''.  In 1864, she married Richard Walter Pigeon, a solicitor and widower from [[Bristol]], England, who had several children, and left the stage.  They had one child, George Walter Noel Pigeon, born in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k104/samesizedfeet/Picture2-1.png Baptisim record from International Genealogical Index v. 5.0, British Isles], FamilySearch&lt;/ref&gt; Hodson left her husband, amid rumours of abuse, and returned to acting, using her maiden name.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k104/samesizedfeet/freemandsDecember191871.png Information from the ''Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser'' (Dublin, Ireland, December 19, 1871, p. 4, col. 5) about an 1870 lawsuit in which Hodson's husband attempted to wrest control from her of the Royalty Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Hodson made her London début at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] under the management of [[Marie Wilton]] (later Lady Bancroft) and H. J. Byron, as Prometheus in Byron's Christmas show, ''Pandora's Box, or, The Young Spark and the Old Flame''.&lt;ref name=Pascoe&gt;Pascoe, Charles E. (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jm0BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 "Hodson, Henrietta."], ''Our actors and actresses. The dramatic list'' (1880), pp. 180–81, David Bogue, London, accessed 25 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], Irving, [[J. L. Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]] and Terry, Hodson joined a new company at [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]], and opened with [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Double Marriage'', in which Hodson played the small role of Jacintha.  About 1868, she moved in with [[Henry Labouchère]],&lt;ref name=Genealogy&gt;[http://www.labouchere.co.uk/linkpages/labbyanddora.htm "Labby and Dora"]. labouchere.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; a member of parliament and later a journalist and playwright, who was one of the founders of Queen's Theatre, but they could not marry until years later when her first husband died.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Other roles that season included Arabella Fotheringay in ''The First Night'', Lucy in Byron's ''Dearer than Life'' and in the same author's ''The Lancashire Lass'', and the title role in ''Oliver Twist''.  In addition to roles in other Byron pieces, she acted at Queen's in various [[extravaganza]]s and burlesques, including ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''The Stranger'' by [[Robert Reece]], ''The Gnome King'' by William Brough, the successful ''The Turn of the Tide'' by [[F. C. Burnand]], and ''Twixt Axe and Crown'' by [[Tom Taylor]].  She stayed with that company for three years.&lt;ref name=Pascoe/&gt;

=== Later years ===
In 1870, she managed the [[Royalty Theatre]] for a season, playing in many of its pieces.  She starred in Reece's ''Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat'' and other burlesques.  Back at Queen's Theatre, she played [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] in ''[[The Tempest]]'' and Imogen in ''[[Cymbeline]]''.  In 1871 she began to manage the Royalty again, starring there in ''The Honeymoon'' as Juliana.  She instituted the innovation of using a hidden orchestra below the stage.  Also in 1871, she played Lady Amaranth in [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keefe's]] ''Wild Oats'', followed by such roles as Nydia the blind girl in [[John Oxenford]]'s version of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton's]] ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1872), Dick Wastrell in ''Old London'', adapted from ''Les Chevaliers du Brouillard'' (1873; a French dramatisation of ''[[Jack Sheppard]]''), and Jane Theobald in Gilbert's ''Ought We to Visit Her?'' (1874).&lt;ref name=Pascoe/&gt; During that play, she quarrelled with Gilbert, threatened him with legal action when he described the quarrel to others, and demanded a written apology, which she then made public.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 104–05&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 in [[Liverpool]], Hodson created the title character of Clytie in [[Joseph Hatton]]'s dramatisation of his novel of the same name.  That year she also created the lead role of Eliza Smith in [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Zoo]]'' in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/zoo/html/zoo_home.html G&amp;S Archive page on ''The Zoo'']&lt;/ref&gt; She repeated the role at the [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1876.  In 1877, she became the leading actress with the [[Haymarket Theatre]], then managed by [[John Baldwin Buckstone]].  There she played Cynisca in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]''.  Gilbert did not wish to cast her, but under her contract with the Haymarket, she insisted on taking the role and again threatened legal action.&lt;ref name=Ainger125&gt;Ainger, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The next Gilbert piece at the theatre was a revival of ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'', and Hodson insisted on playing a different role than the one Gilbert and Buckstone wished.&lt;ref name=Ainger125/&gt; Buckstone gave the actress notice that she would not be needed the next season.  Hodson blamed Gilbert and consulted her solicitor.  When he told her that she had no case, she instead complained of Gilbert's "persecution" of her and criticised his demanding directing methods in a pamphlet-letter circulated among theatre professionals.  Gilbert responded quickly with an open letter, setting forth a series of letters and references that showed inaccuracies in Hodson's statements.  This was published on 27 May 1877 in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', along with Hodson's rebuttal.  In the end, she did not appear in ''The Palace of Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=3 May 2011 }}, Retrieved on 12 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Hodson returned to Queen's Theatre as Dolores, Countess Rysoor, in Labouchère's ''Fatherland'', an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Patrie!''.  She retired from acting soon afterwards and lived in comfort at [[Alexander Pope]]'s Villa at Cross Deep [[Twickenham]], near London, with Labouchère.  However, in 1881, she tutored and mentored [[Lillie Langtry]] in her early stage work, accompanying Langtry to America the next year, although the two soon fell out, and Hodson returned to England.

In 1887, she finally married Labouchère, with whom she already had a daughter, Mary Dorothea (1884–1944).  In 1903 Hodson and her husband moved to Villa Christina, near [[Florence, Italy]].  She died there at the age of 69.  Her daughter, Mary Dorothea, married Carlo Emanuele Starabba, 2nd Marchese di Rudinì (the son of [[Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudinì]], prime minister of Italy) in 1903, then the Prince Gyalma Odescalchi De Szerem, and finally Don Eugenio [[Ruspoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Princess Eugene Ruspoli Obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 4 December 1944; p. 6, col.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">[[File:His Majesty's Theatre, Montreal.jpeg|thumb|His Majesty's Theatre, circa 1910.]]
'''Her Majesty's Theatre''' (also known as '''His Majesty's Theatre''') was a theatre located on [[Guy Street]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. For nearly 65 years it was one of the most important venues for [[orchestra]]l [[concert]]s, [[recital]]s, [[play (theatre)|plays]], [[opera]]s, and [[ballet]]s in that city.

[[File:Social. At His Majesty's Theatre BAnQ P48S1P05923.jpg|thumb|left|Spectators at a [[premiere]], His Majesty's Theatre, 1940.]]

Built in 1897-1898 during the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], the theatre was in continual operation until it was demolished in 1963. As the name of the theatre changed with the sex of the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]], the theatre was known as His Majesty's Theatre from 1901 to 1952, and then reverted to the title of Her Majesty's Theatre upon the accession of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] in 1952.

It was the home of the [[Montreal Opera Company]] (1910-1913), the [[National Opera Company of Canada]] (1914), the [[Montreal Orchestra]] (1930-1941), and the [[Opera Guild of Montreal]] (1942-1963). The theatre was the main venue for the [[Montreal Festivals]] from 1940-1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001602 |title=Her Majesty's Theatre |work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608234759/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0001602 |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ikat''' is a dyeing technique used to pattern textiles that employs [[resist dyeing]] on the yarns prior to dyeing and weaving the fabric.

In ikat the resist is formed by binding individual yarns or bundles of yarns with a tight wrapping applied in the desired pattern (''ikat'' means "to bind" in the Indonesian language). The yarns are then dyed. The bindings may then be altered to create a new pattern and the yarns dyed again with another colour. This process may be repeated multiple times to produce elaborate, multicolored patterns. When the dyeing is finished all the bindings are removed and the yarns are woven into cloth. In other resist-dyeing techniques such as [[tie-dye]] and [[batik]] the resist is applied to the woven cloth, whereas in ikat the resist is applied to the yarns before they are woven into cloth. Because the surface design is created in the yarns rather than on the finished cloth, in ikat both fabric faces are patterned.

A characteristic of ikat textiles is an apparent "blurriness" to the design. The blurriness is a result of the extreme difficulty the weaver has lining up the dyed yarns so that the pattern comes out perfectly in the finished cloth. The blurriness can be reduced by using finer yarns or by the skill of the craftsperson. Ikats with little blurriness, multiple colours and complicated patterns are more difficult to create and therefore often more expensive. However, the blurriness that is so characteristic of ikat is often prized by textile collectors.

Ikat is produced in many traditional textile centres around the world, from India to Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Japan (where it is called [[kasuri]]), Africa and Latin America. Double ikats—in which both the [[Warp_and_weft | warp and weft]] yarns are tied and dyed before being woven into a single textile—are relatively rare because of the intensive skilled labour required to produce them. They are produced in [[Okinawa]] islands of Japan, the village of [[Tenganan]] in [[Indonesia]], and the villages of [[Puttapaka Saree|Puttapaka]]&lt;ref name="hindu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/19/stories/2008121953352000.htm|title=Weaving a Puttapaka tradition - The Hindu|publisher=hindu.com|accessdate=30 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304180204/http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/19/stories/2008121953352000.htm|archivedate=4 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bhoodan Pochampally]] in Telangana in India. In fact, many other parts of India have their indigenous Ikat weaving techniques.

The latter, known as Patan Patola, is one of the rarest forms of double Ikat, which takes a lot of time and effort in dyeing and weaving. A different form of Patola ikat is made in Rajkot, Gujarat. Telia Rumal made in Andhra, Pasapalli&lt;ref name="OdishaHandloom" /&gt; from Odisha and Puttapaka from Telangana are other Indian Ikats. &lt;ref&gt;''{{cite web|url=https://www.saree.com/about-ikkat-sarees|title=Other parts of India have their indigenous Ikat weaving techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Gujarat patola.jpg|thumb|Detail of a classic Gujarati ''patola'' of double ikat from the early 19th century. [[LACMA]] textile collections.]]
In '''warp ikat''' it is only the warp yarns that are dyed using the ikat technique. The weft yarns are dyed a solid colour. The ikat pattern is clearly visible in the warp yarns wound onto the loom even before the weft is woven in. Warp ikat is, amongst others, produced in Indonesia; more specifically in [[Kalimantan]], [[Sulawesi]], and [[Sumatra]] by respectively the [[Dayak people|Dayaks]], [[Torajan]]s and [[Batak]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bali by Michael Möbius, Annette Ster&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''weft ikat''' it is the weaving or weft yarn that carries the dyed patterns.  Therefore, the pattern only appears as the weaving proceeds.  Weft ikats are much slower to weave than warp ikat because the weft yarns must be carefully adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to maintain the clarity of the design.

'''Double Ikat''' is a technique in which both warp and the weft are resist-dyed prior to weaving.  Obviously it is the most difficult to make and the most expensive. Double ikat is only produced in three countries: [[India]], [[Japan]] and [[Indonesia]]. The double ikat made in [[Patan, Gujarat]] in India is the most complicated.  Called "patola," it is made using fine [[silk]] yarns and many colours.  It may be patterned with a small motif that is repeated many times across the length of a six-meter sari.  Sometimes the Patan double ikat is pictorial with no repeats across its length.  That is, each small design element in each colour was individually tied in the warp and weft yarns.  It's an extraordinary achievement in the textile arts.  These much sought after textiles were traded by the Dutch East Indies company for exclusive spice trading rights with the sultanates of Indonesia.  The double ikat woven in the small [[Bali Aga]] village, [[Tenganan]] in east Bali&lt;ref name="Balinese Textiles p.117"&gt;Balinese Textiles; Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin, Marie-Louise Nabhollz-kartaschoff, Urs Ramseyer. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|0-7141-2505-9}} p.117&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Indonesia]] reflects the influence of these prized textiles.  Some of the Tenganan double ikat motifs are taken directly from the patola tradition.  In India double ikat is also woven in Puttapaka, [[Nalgonda District]] and is called ''[[Puttapaka Saree]].''&lt;ref name="aponline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/arts_ikat.html|title=APonline - History and Culture-Arts and Crafts - Ikat|publisher=aponline.gov.in|accessdate=30 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119164655/http://www.aponline.gov.in/Quick%20links/HIST-CULT/arts_ikat.html|archivedate=19 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Japan, double ikat is woven in the Okinawa islands where it is called ''tate-yoko gasuri''.&lt;ref name="Tomito J p.7"&gt;Tomito J &amp; N.

'''Pasapalli Ikat''' is one of the Ikkat saree and Pasapalli ikat saree made in Odisha. The word Pasapalli comes from 'Pasa' which means a board game with four clear parts (much like Ludo). Each pasapalli ikat saree or material - which is made with the same technique as the Sambalpuri Ikat - has some or the other form of this chequered design. &lt;ref&gt;''{{cite web|url=https://www.saree.com/about-ikkat-sarees|title=About Pasapalli Ikat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Ikat'' is an [[Indonesian language]] word, which depending on context, can be the [[noun]]s: [[cord (sewing)|cord]], [[yarn|thread]], [[knot]] and the finished ''ikat'' fabric as well as the [[verb]]s "to tie" or "to bind". It has a direct etymological relation to [[Javanese language]] of the same word. Thus, the name of the finished ''ikat'' woven fabric originates from the ''tali'' (threads, ropes) being ''ikat'' (tied, bound, knotted) before they are being put in ''celupan'' (dyed by way of dipping), then ''berjalin'' (woven, intertwined) resulting in a ''berjalin ikat''- reduced to ''ikat''.

The introduction of the term ''ikat'' into European language is attributed to Rouffaer.&lt;ref&gt;Umesh Charan Patnaik, Aswini Kumar Mishra, 1997. ''Handloom industry in action''. 1997. pp38. G. K. Ghosh, Shukla Ghosh, 2000. ''Ikat textiles of India''. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ikat'' is now a generic English loanword used to describe the process and the cloth itself regardless of where the fabric was produced or how it is patterned.

In Indonesian the plural of ''ikat'' remains ''ikat''. However, in English a suffix plural 's' is commonly added, as in ''ikats.''  This is true in other some other languages. All are correct.

==Distribution==
[[File:Jewish Children with their Teacher in Samarkand.jpg|right|thumb|A child wearing an ikat robe, Samarkand 19th century. Children often wore small versions of adult clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/child.html "Dress Codes: Revealing the Jewish Wardrobe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023916/http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/child.html |date=3 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ikat is a weaving style common to many world cultures. It is probably one of the oldest forms of textile decoration. However, it is most prevalent in Indonesia, India and Japan. In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], ''ikat'' is still common in [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Mexico]].

In the 19th century, the [[Silk Road]] desert oases of [[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]], [[Hotan]] and [[Kashgar]] (in what is now [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Xinjiang]] in [[Central Asia]]) were famous for their fine silk Uzbek/Uyghur ikat.

India, Japan, Indonesia and many other [[Southeast Asia]]n nations including [[Cambodia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines]] and [[Thailand]] have weaving cultures with long histories of ikat production.

Double ikat weaving is still found in India, Japan and Indonesia. In Indonesia, it is still woven in [[Bali]], [[Java]], [[Kalimantan]] or [[Borneo]] and [[Sumatra]].
Another country that has been weaving Ikat is Iran.
The name of this technique in yazd is Daraee.Daraee means wealth,the reason of this naming is that in wedding ceremonies, There were these fabrics in the bride’s dowry, and the people who had bought these fabrics were rich.

==History==

As textiles do not last well through history, scholars have so far been unable to determine where the technique of ikat originated. Nevertheless, some parts of Asia demonstrates strong ikat traditions which suggest its possible origin; they are [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="Love2know"&gt;{{cite web | title = Ikat | author = Ruth Barnes | work = Love to Know | url = http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fabrics-fibers/ikat | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161114231155/http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/fabrics-fibers/ikat | archivedate = 14 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it probably developed in several different locations independently, since ikat was known to be produced in several [[pre-Columbian]] Central and South American cultures.

The term "ikat" has [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesian]] origin, and it was introduced into European textile vocabulary back in early 20th century, when the Dutch scholars begin to study the rich textile traditions of [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]] archipelago (today Indonesia).&lt;ref name="Love2know"/&gt;

[[Uyghurs]] call it atlas (in IPA [ɛtlɛs]) and use it only for woman's clothing. The historical record indicates that there were 27 types of atlas during [[Qing]] occupation. Now there are only four types of Uyghur atlas remaining: Qara-atlas (Darayi, black ikat used for older women's clothing), Khoja'e-atlas (yellow, blue, purple ikat used for married women), Qizil-atlas (red ikat used for girls) and [[Yarkant County|Yarkant]]-atlas (Khan-atlas). Yarkant-atlas has more diverse styles; during Yarkant Khanate (16th century), there ten different styles of Yarkant-atlas.&lt;ref&gt;Abdukerim Raxman, Reweydulla Hemdulla, Sherip Xushtar, ''Uyghur Örp-Adetliri'', Urumqi, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warp ikat===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}

Ikat created by [[dye]]ing the warp are simpler to make than either weft ikat or double ikat. First the yarns--[[cotton]], [[silk]], [[wool]] or other fibres—are wound onto a frame.  Then they are tied into bundles. The bundles may be covered with wax, as in [[batik]].   (However, in making batik, the craftsperson applies the resist to the finished cloth rather than to the yarns to be woven.)   The warp yarns are then wrapped tightly with thread or some other dye-resistant material to prevent unwanted dye permeation. The procedure is repeated, depending on the number of colours required to complete the design. Multiple coloration is common, requiring multiple rounds of tying and dyeing. The newly dyed and thoroughly washed bundles are wound onto the loom to produce the warp (longitudinal yarns).  Warp threads are adjusted for the desired alignment for precise motifs.

Some ikat traditions, such as Central Asia's, embrace a blurred aesthetic in the design. Other traditions favour a more precise and more difficult to achieve refinement in the placement of the ikat yarns.  South American and Indonesian ikat are known for a high degree of warp alignment. Weavers must adjust the warp repeatedly to maintain pattern alignment.

Patterns result from a combination of the warp dye and the [[weft]] thread colour.  Some warp ikat traditions are designed with vertical-axis symmetry or have a "mirror-image" running along their long centre line.   That is, whatever pattern or design is woven on the right is duplicated on the left in reverse order about a central warp thread group. Patterns can be created in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.

===Weft ikat===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Weft]] ikat uses resist-dyeing for the [[weft]] yarns. The movement of the weft yarns in the weaving process means precisely delineated patterns are more difficult to weave.  The weft yarn must be adjusted after each passing of the shuttle to preserve the pattern.

Nevertheless, highly skilled artisans can produce precise weft ikat. Japanese weavers produce very accurate indigo and white weft ikat with small scale motifs in cotton.  Weavers in Odisha, India have replicated fine Urdu script in weft ikat. In Thailand, weavers make silk sarongs depicting birds and complex geometrical designs in seven colour weft ikat.

In some precise weft ikat traditions (Gujarat, India), two artisans weave the cloth: one passes the shuttle and the other adjusts the way the yarn lies in the shed.

As the weft is commonly a continuous strand, aberrations or variation in coloration are cumulative. Some weft ikat traditions incorporate this affect into their aesthetic. Patterns become transformed by the weaving process into irregular and erratic designs.  Guatemalan ikat is well-noted for its beautiful "blurs."

==Double ikat==

Double ikat is created by resist-dyeing both the [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[weft]] prior to weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, John. ''Indian Textiles in the East''. London, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2009, pp. 10, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sources use the term double ikat only when the warp and weft patterning overlap to form common, identical motifs.  If they do not, the result is referred to as compound ikat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dyer's Art ikat, batik, plangi|last=Larsen|first=Jack Lenor|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold|year=1976|isbn=0442246854|location=New York|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of weaving requires the most skill for precise patterns to be woven and is considered the premiere form of ikat. The amount of labour and skill required also make it the most expensive, and many poor quality cloths flood the tourist markets. Indian and Indonesian examples typify highly precise double ikat. Especially prized are the double ikats woven in silk known in India as ''patola''  (singular: ''patolu''). These are from Gujarat (Cambay).  During the colonial era, Dutch merchants used patola as prestigious trade cloths during the peak of the spice trade.&lt;ref&gt;Balinese Textiles; Brigitta Hauser-Schaublin, Marie-Louise Nabhollz-kartaschoff, Urs Ramseyer.

[[File:Sambalpuri Ikat weaving loom (Tanta) from Odisha.jpg|thumb|left|Sambalpuri double ikat weaving loom (''Tanta'') from [[Odisha]], also known as [[Orissa Ikat]].]]
In Indonesia double ikat is only woven in the [[Bali Aga]] village of [[Tenganan]]. These cloths have high spiritual significance. In Tenganan they are still worn for specific ceremonies. Outside Tenganan, [[geringsing]] are treasured as they are purported to have magical powers.&lt;ref name="Balinese Textiles p.117"/&gt;

The double ikat of Japan is woven in the Okinawa islands and is called ''tate-yoko gasuri''.&lt;ref name="Tomito J p.7"/&gt;

The [[Puttapaka Saree]]&lt;ref name="indiaheritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaheritage.org/creative/craft/textiles.htm|title=Textiles|publisher=indiaheritage.org|accessdate=30 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143231/http://www.indiaheritage.org/creative/craft/textiles.htm|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is made in Puttapaka village, Samsthan Narayanpuram mandal in Nalgonda district, India. It is known for its unique style of silk saris. The symmetric design is over 200 years old. The Ikat is warp-based. The Puttapaka Saree is a double ikat.

Before the weaving is done, a manual winding of yarn, called Asu, needs to be performed. This process takes up to 5 hours per sari and is usually done by the womenfolk, who suffer physical strain through constantly moving their hands back and forth over 9000 times for each sari. In 1999, a young weaver C Mallesham developed a machine which automated Asu, thus developing a technological solution for a decades-old unsolved problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/asu-machine-to-aid-weaverstiedye-sarees/341893/ Asu machine to aid weavers of tie and dye sarees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011174029/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/asu-machine-to-aid-weaverstiedye-sarees/341893/ |date=11 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oshima===
Oshima ikat is a uniquely Japanese ikat. In Oshima, the warp and weft threads are both used as warp to weave stiff fabric, upon which the thread for the ikat weaving is spot-dyed. Then the mats are unravelled and the dyed thread is woven into oshima cloth.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The Oshima process is duplicated in Java and Bali, and is reserved for ruling royalty, notably ''Klungkung'' and ''Ubud'': most especially the ''dodot'' cloth semi-[[cummerbund]] of Javanese court attire.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Other countries==
[[File:Ikat 2006.10.jpg|thumb|Ikat ''abr'', silk and cotton, mid-19th century, [[Uzbekistan]]. [[Smithsonian]] collections.]]
===Cambodia===
The [[Cambodia]]n ikat is a weft ikat woven of silk on a multi-shaft loom with an uneven [[twill]] weave, which results in the weft threads showing more prominently on the front of the fabric than the back.&lt;ref&gt;[Mattiebelle Gittinger and H. Leedom Lefforts,''Textiles and the Thai Experience in South-East Asia'', Washington, DC 1992, PP38–39]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill Green,"The Cambodia Weaving Tradition: Little Known Weaving and Loom Artifacts,"''Arts of Asia'', vold.27, no. 5, Hong Kong, 199, pp.&amp;nbsp;86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, Cambodian ikat was considered among the finest textiles of the world. When the King of Thailand came to the US in 1856, he brought as a gift for President [[Franklin Pierce]] fine Cambodian ikat cloth.&lt;ref&gt;''Gettinger, op.cit., pp 149. 167''&lt;/ref&gt; The most intricately patterned of the Cambodian fabrics are the ''sampot hol''—skirts worn by the women—and the ''pidans''—wall hangings used to decorate the pagoda or the home for special ceremonies.

Unfortunately, Cambodian culture suffered massive disruption and destruction during the mid-20th century Indochina wars but most especially during the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime. Most weavers were killed and the whole art of Cambodian ikat was in danger of disappearing.

[[Kikuo Morimoto]] is a prominent pioneer in re-introducing ikat to Cambodia. In 1995, he moved from Japan and located one or two elderly weavers and Khmer Rouge survivors who knew the art and have taught it to a new generation.

===Thailand===

In Thailand, the local weft ikat type of woven cloth is known as '''Matmi''' (also spelled 'Mudmee' or 'Mudmi').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surin.go.th/web_eng/web_eng/silk.htm Silk at Ban Sawai] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719102131/http://www.surin.go.th/web_eng/web_eng/silk.htm |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Traditional Mudmi cloth was woven for daily use among the nobility. Other uses included ceremonial costumes. Warp ikat in cotton is also produced by the Karen and Lawa tribal peoples in northern Thailand.

This type of cloth is the favourite silk item woven by ethnic [[Khmer people|Khmer]] people living in southern [[Isaan]], mainly in [[Surin Province|Surin]], [[Sisaket Province|Sisaket]] and [[Buriram Province|Buriram]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://icmr.cru.in.th/journal/133255110254.pdf Chusak Sukaranandana - ''Woven cloth, an exquisite handicraft of Thai-Lao-Khmer ethnic groups in Thailand''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818070110/http://icmr.cru.in.th/journal/133255110254.pdf |date=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
In Iran, Ikat  which is called Darayee has  been carried out in different areas and now in Yazd there are  some workshops to produce it. it is  said that  this kind of cloth has been used in the dowry, as a bride's property in the old days. in  popular belief, there is a quote that people who bought this type of cloth were wealthy.&lt;ref&gt;http://donya-e-eqtesad.com/بخش-بیشتر-26/472405-دارایی-بافته-ای-از-ابریشم-رنگ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208045845/http://donya-e-eqtesad.com/%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%B4-%D8%A8%DB%8C%D8%B4%D8%AA%D8%B1-26/472405-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%B4%D9%85-%D8%B1%D9%86%DA%AF |date=8 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ikat patterns are common among the [[Andes]] peoples, and native people of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], and [[Venezuela]]. The [[Mapuche]] shawl or poncho of the [[Huaso]] cowboys of Chile is perhaps the item best known in the West. Wool and ''[[Fique|cabuya]]'' fibre are the most commonly used. 

The Mexican [[rebozo]]s can be made from silk, wool or cotton and are frequently ikat dyed. These shawls are seen as a part of the Mexican national identity and most women own at least one.

Latin American ''ikat'' (Jaspe, as it is known to [[Maya people|Maya]] weavers) textiles are commonly woven on a back-strap [[loom]]. Pre-dyed [[warp (weaving)|warp]] threads are a common item in traditional markets- saving the weaver much mess, expense, time and labour.&lt;ref name=Waddington&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Waddingtons|Waddington]] | url=http://backstrapweaving.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/backstrap-weaving-cross-knit-looping-tutorial-and-ikathttp://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/Ikat/index.html | title=South American Ikat | work=South America | accessdate= 3 May 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Latin American innovation which may also be employed elsewhere is to employ a round stick around which warp threads are wrapped in groups, thus allowing more precise control of the desired design.&lt;ref name=Waddington/&gt; The "corte" is the typical wrap skirt used worn by Guatemalan women.

==Accreditation==
As of 2010, the government of the Republic of Indonesia announced it would pursue UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage accreditation for its ikat weaving, along with ''songket'', and [[gamelan]] having successfully attained this UNESCO recognition for its [[wayang]], [[batik]] and the [[keris|kris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher= [[Antara News Indonesia]] | url= http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1265353577/batik-wayang-keris-jadi-warisan-budaya-dunia | title= ''Batik, Wayang, Keris: Jadi Warisan Budaya Dunia'' | work= Indonesian | accessdate= 3 May 2010 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100523121325/http://www.antaranews.com/berita/1265353577/batik-wayang-keris-jadi-warisan-budaya-dunia | archivedate= 23 May 2010 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1597">'''The University of Arts of Cuba / Instituto Superior de Arte''' ('''ISA''') was established on September 1, 1976, by the Cuban government as a school for the arts.  Its original structure had three schools: [[Music]], [[Visual Arts]], and [[Performing Arts]].

At present the ISA has four schools, the previous three and one for Arts and Audiovisual Communication Media. There are also four teaching schools in the provinces, one in [[Camagüey]], two in [[Holguín]] and one in [[Santiago de Cuba]].

ISA offers pre-degree and post-degree courses, as well as a wide spectrum of brief and extension courses, including preparation for Cuban and foreign professors for a degree of Doctor on Sciences in Art.

Predegree education has increased to five careers: Music, Visual Arts, Theatre Arts, Dance Arts and Arts and Audiovisual Communication Media.

In 1996, the ISA established the ''National Award of Artistic Teaching'', conceived for recognizing a lifework devoted to arts teaching.

[[File:Master Mohammad Seirafian, Isfahan, Iran (2013).JPG|thumb|Master Mohammad Seirafian, Isfahan, Iran (2013)]]

The [[Iran]]ian city of '''[[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]''' (also spelt Esfahan) has long been one of the centres for production of the famous '''[[Persian carpet]]''' (or '''rug'''). Isfahani carpets are known for their high quality. The most famous workshop in Isfahan is ''Seirafian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizsan.hu/en/rugopedia-page/87|title=rugopedia_page {{!}} Bizsan|website=www.bizsan.hu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isfahan==
Isfahan rugs are knotted on either silk or cotton foundations, with up to 1.000.000 Persian knots/sqm(there have been pieces created by Seyrafian master workshop with higher [[knot count]]), using exceptionally good quality (referred to as kork wool in Iran) wool for the pile, which is normally clipped quite low.  In the beginning of the renewal of Isfahan as the carpet center of high quality rugs, most rugs used traditional motifs inspired by the architectural motifs and tiles that decorated the historical buildings of this great city. Designers were further inspired by the poets of Persia (Rumi, Hafez, Attar), nature, and religious spiritual intimations that are deeply ingrained in the culture. In contemporary items the palette has become more pastel, utilizing the technical perfection and artistic flair of this "City of Art". Both Classical and contemporary Isfahan’s are extremely attractive, and the subduing of the palette, particularly the elimination of strong reds, makes them more compatible with Western decorative schemes.

A range of traditional designs are still used including allover Shah Abbas, Vase, Tree of Life and Pictorial schemes but by far the most popular composition is based on a circular central medallion (Derived from the famous mosque of Shah Lutf Allah in Isfahan) set against an elegantly sculpted field decorated with intricately purling vine palmette and flor motifs.

Antique/ semi-Antique rugs of Isfahan are more colorful and richer in tone than that of Nain, a nearby city renowned for its exceptional handmade rugs. Antique Isfahans are quite sought after since production had been almost completely been halted since 1722, during which the Afghan invasion occurred. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that it was firmly reestablished.

Shah Abbas the Great was an inspired King of the Safavid dynasty, and in consequence not only moved the capital of Persia to Isfahan from Qazvin but also started an artistic renaissance within the capital of his court. Under his vision and guidance carpet weaving in Isfahan flourished. However the Afghan invasion dealt a serious blow to this industry which it never recovered from until the beginning of the 20th century. Some early pieces created in the last century can be found which consist of 500.000 knots-1.000.000 knots/m2, however these are rare and few in number. World war I brought a change in “modern” Isfahan which was the center of weaving for the fashion industry of Iran. The change of fashion in the world also influenced Iran, causing Isfahan to lose its lucrative fabric industry. However, the shrewd businessman of Isfahan decided to utilize the fine quality wool in fabrics and Aba’s into high quality Persian rugs which again reestablished Isfahan as a base for one of the finest and most beautiful carpets of Iran.

Some Isfahani rugs became known in Western Europe as '''"Polish rugs"'''or "Polonese rugs". This name refers to carpets woven with silk, golden and silver threads in Persia during the 16th-18th centuries and exported to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. They were commissioned by wealthy [[szlachta|Polish noblemen]] and decorated with their coats of arms. Some of them were later resold to West European buyers who were often convinced of their Polish origin, hence their name.&lt;ref name=PWN&gt;{{pl icon}} [[Wielka Encyklopedia Powszechna PWN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Juma Mosque of Shamakhi''' or '''Friday Mosque of Shamakhi''' ({{lang-az|Şamaxı Cümə Məscidi}}) is a [[mosque]] in the city of [[Shamakhi]], [[Azerbaijan]].

==History of establishment==
Construction date of the mosque- 743-744 relies on research of a geological commission coming from [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]], which was led by prince Shahgulu [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]]. This date was defined with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ligature on the facade of the Friday Mosque, stating the year 126 according to [[Islamic calendar]] as the establishment year.&lt;ref&gt;''Fatullayev.S.S.''. Джума-мечеть в Шемахе. — Baku:National Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Just in this period the construction of new religious buildings – mosques – was begun in the territory of Azerbaijan. Historical appearance of ancient [[Islam]]ic architectural monuments was related to Arabs’ governance and spreading of [[Islam]] in the territory of Azerbaijan. Friday Mosque of Shamakhi is considered the first mosque in the [[Caucasus]] after cathedral Friday Mosque of [[Derbent]], which was constructed in 734. 

The construction date of the mosque is dated from the governance period of [[Caliphate]]’s vicar in the Caucasus and [[Dagestan]], Arabic commander Maslam ibn Abd-al Melik, brother of [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] Valil I (705-715), by whom Shamakhi was chosen as the residence. In these years Arab governors, strengthening towers of this ancient city with the rich cultural heritage, began the construction of new structures in its territory. Arabs attached the great importance to Shamakhi, which is visible from the great architectural appearance of Friday Mosque.

==Reconstructions==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:Mezquita del Viernes, Shamakhi, Azerbaiyán, 2016-09-27, DD 22-36 HDR PAN.jpg|thumb|350px|Panoramic night view]]
Considerable demolitions and damages of Friday Mosque during the battles and earthquakes were the reason of restorative reconstructions of the mosque’s building. According to information of [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani|Imadeddin Isfahani]] - a chronicler of Seljuq’s epoch, beginning from 1123, [[Shirvanshah]] rulers resorted to [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]]’s sultan Mahmud (1118-1131), for defense from forays of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]ns. The chronicle says that “the assailants demolished the mosque, knocked down the minaret, plundered in the city” at that time in Shamakhi. 

The first construction of Friday Mosque was begun at the end of the 12th century and was related to the considerable damage of Friday Mosque’s building suffered from partial forays and was conditioned by the strengthening of Shirvanshakh’s power during the reign of the ruler [[Manuchehr (name)|Manuchehr]] III, by whom were built new constructions and strengthened the city walls. Historian-archeologist Jiddi, relying on historical sources and books about construction reported about a sobriquet “The Great [[Khagan]]”, how Manuchehr II was called due his great merits. At that time, the eminent [[Persian people|Persian]] poet [[Khaqani]], native of Shamakhi, wrote that “the glory of his city overshadowed the glory of [[Bukhara]]”. Archeological excavations, held in 1970, in the territory of the mosque confirmed the considerable constructional and architectural changes, dated from that epoch. Considerable amount of [[madrasah]], cell-huts and graves were found during the archeological excavations. 

The second construction of the mosque was made in the 17th century, during the reign of Safavid Dynasty. [[Evliya Çelebi]]-[[Turkey|Turkish]] scientist-traveler visiting Shamakhi in 1656, said that Friday Mosque is the largest religious construction of the city among others. In his work Evliya Chelebi reports about some structural changes of Friday Mosque during the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]]’ epoch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vostlit.info/Texts/rus10/Celebi4/frametext7.htm ''Evliya Chelebi''. Book of travels. «Seyahetname». Земли Закавказья и сопредельных областей Малой Азии и Ирана. Глава VII. — Moscow, Наука, 1983]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The third reconstruction of the mosque was made in 1860 by province architect Hajibababeyov after the great damage of the building by the earthquake in 1859. This reconstruction was made on the basis of draft images of Russian artist [[Grigory Gagarin]]. 

The fourth reconstruction was begun after the strongest earthquake in 1902, which was demolished and damaged a lot of buildings of Shamakhi. For complete reconstruction of the mosque were gathered donations by philanthropists and was created a special committee. Primarily, the reconstruction of the mosque was charged to the eminent Azerbaijani architect of that time-[[Ziverbey Ahmadbeyov]], a native of Shamakhi city. One of the conditions of the architect was preservation of external of the mosque, but the committee didn’t agree with that, which became the reason of the architect’s discharge from the subsequent works of the mosque’s reconstruction. Continuation of the work in the mosque was offered to the architect Józef Plośko.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polonia-baku.org/ru/ploszko.phtml '' Фатуллаев-Фигаров Ш.''. Юзеф Плошко. Общество «Полония-Азербайджан».]&lt;/ref&gt; Variation of the project, presented by Józef Plośko in 1909, provided considerable change of façade and external look of the mosque. The project was based on the foundation of elder plan and results of the uncompleted construction, but there appeared orderly flanking minarets on it and open balconies with light pavilions, symmetric-axial composition of the mosques with pair [[minaret]]s was completed by a great central cupola. Such planning was used in the 15th century in construction of [[Tabriz]] school of architecture for the first time and also adopted architectural features of [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshahs’ Palace]] ensemble in [[Baku]]. Construction of the mosque based on Józef Plośko’s project was charged to D.Sadykhbeyov, but such important elements as central cupola, side minarets, gallery, portal and central stair platform were deleted from the project during the work because of the deficiency of financial resources.

In 1918, Friday Mosque, which was not fully constructed, again was suffered from fire, made by armed units of [[Armenia]]n party “[[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaktsutiun]]” under the guidance of Stepan Lalayan, whose attack to Shamakhi began nearly simultaneously with [[March Days|bloody events]] in Baku.&lt;ref name ="archive"&gt;[http://karabakh-doc.azerall.info/ru/arxdoc/ad029.php Данные архивных материалов о зверствах армян в Шемахинском уезде (1918 г.)]&lt;/ref&gt; According to petition of Shamakhi people living in Baku to general Thompson – Commander-in-Chief of the [[Union Army]] “the city was completely destroyed, and then-burned, none of the mosques could escape destruction”. As a result of the fire, 1800 residents-women, children, old men, who were forcibly driven away to the mosque were burned alive by dashnaks. Rare manuscripts and books were also destroyed. Today, everybody can see tracks of fire on the walls of the mosque.

In December 2009, the order about the restoration of the state historical-architectural monument Friday mosque of Shamakhi was written by [[Ilham Aliyev]]-the President of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The Friday Mosque Complex always distinguished with its volume and silhouette among cultic and civil monuments of Azerbaijan because of the correlation with earlier monuments of [[Islamic architecture]], keeping its composition centre. The only extant sketch of Friday Mosque was made in 1847, by Russian architect G.Gagarin from life, who portrayed architectural monuments and other cities of Azerbaijan in his pictures. Just these pictures make an idea about the external look and internal ornamentation of old Friday Mosque. The ancient internal planning organization of the mosque has been kept till now, in spite of the multiple reconstructions. Three-hall structure of the mosque, three-section internal area covered with central and not great side cupolas are seen on G.Gagarin’s pictures. The central pointed dome, pillars of side sections and oblong interior of the main hall of warship makes Friday Mosque similar with Friday Mosque of Derbent. Plan of the mosque is rectangular, sizes of the mosque’s are 46 meters length and 28 meters width, the mosque has a large warship hall, divided into three separated quadratic sections related with each other by open and large apertures.&lt;ref&gt;''Fatullayev S.S.''. Градостроительство и архитектура Азербайджана XIX - нач. XX веков. — Л:1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Each prt of the mosque has separate mihrab and aperture for entrance. Friday Mosque is called three-hall mosque because of a such plan. Such kind of planning reminds of planning organization of the well-known Great mosque of Umayyads in Damask, which was built in 708.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakililar.az/ca/history/khristark.html ''Салимова А.Т'', Аз.ГУСиА. Влияние христианства на архитектуру Азербайджана.]&lt;/ref&gt; Friday Mosque of the 8th century in [[Agsu (city)|Aghsu]], which was destroyed during the fire in 1918, was differed with analogical planning. The frequent constructions enabled to keep initial internal outlines and foundation of the mosque in whole, though the internal ornamentation and some details of external façade suffered definite modifications. Archeological researches showed that, plan of the building remained invariable, in spite of the multiple reconstructions. 

Most considerable modifications on the architectural structure of the mosque were made on Józef Plośko’s project. The architect added elements of the Eastern architecture, taking traditions of Islamic architecture as a principle of that time to his project. Planning structure of Friday Mosque should be supplemented with dynamic content and special picturesqueness in Józef Plośko’s interpretation. Eliminating side abutments of the warship hall, the architect tried to create most solid and monumental interior. For creating the same size of three halls of the mosque, the architect with specific artistic-plastic expressiveness conceived non-traditional construction, the metallic carcasses of which were produced in Warsaw for Shirvan zone of the cupola. For strengthening significance of the composition, Plośko developed high multiple-window lodgement to which the central cupola leaned on. There should be four decorative minarets around it. Ornamental decorations, shebeke (window frameworks with gashed patterns) and decorative pillars were also intended to be in the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">'''Laboratoire Agit'Art''' was an art collective founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1973 by writer and performer [[Youssouf John]] with goal of revitalising artistic production and critique institutional frameworks and the philosophy of [[Negritude]] in particular. John soon left for Martinique and the group/workshop was handed on to [[Issa Samb]].&lt;ref&gt;p.106, In Senghor′s Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960–1995. Author(s): Elizabeth Harney: Published: 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Other key members included {{Interlanguage link multi|El Hadj Sy|fr}} (El Sy), {{Interlanguage link multi|Bouna Medoune Seye|fr}}, [[Djibril Diop Mambéty]], and Youssoupha Dione.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary |title=Glossary of art terms |publisher= [[Tate]] |location=UK |accessdate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MMA-afu11&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11&amp;region=afu#/Key-Events |title= Western and Central Sudan, 1900 A.D.–present: Key Events |work= Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |location=New York |accessdate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group consisting of artists, writers, film-makers, performance artists and musicians. The group was based at Dakar's squatted [[Village des Arts]] until the squatted village was evicted by the army ion 23 September 1983&lt;ref&gt;p. 143, In Senghor′s Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960–1995. Author(s): Elizabeth Harney: Published: 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective made work in a variety of medium, including paint, found objects, sculpture, performance art and street art. Their exhibitions were organised around satyrical theatrical productions of [[Leopold Senghor]] and [[Aime Cesaire]]'s works. The collective marked a move away from [[Negritude]] philosophy of Senghor and Cesaire and towards a more avant-garde critique of both modernism and traditional ideas while still drawing from both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">A '''leading actor''', '''leading actress''', '''star''', or simply '''lead''', plays the role of the [[protagonist]] of a film, television show or play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/lead_10 |title=lead noun (ACTOR) - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2014-04-28 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''lead'' may also refer to the largest role in the piece and ''leading actor'' may refer to a person who typically plays such parts or an actor with a respected body of work. Some [[actor]]s are [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as leads, but most play the lead in some performances and [[supporting actor|supporting]] or [[character actor|character]] roles in others.

Sometimes there is more than one significant leading role in a dramatic piece, and the actors are said to play ''co-leads''; a large [[supporting actor|supporting role]] may be considered a ''secondary lead''. Award nominations for acting often reflect such ambiguities.  Thus, sometimes two actors in the same performance piece are nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] or [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] -- categories traditionally reserved for leads. For example, in 1935 [[Clark Gable]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Franchot Tone]] were each nominated for the Best Actor [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. There can even be controversy over whether a particular performance should be nominated in the Best Actor/Actress or [[Best Supporting Actor]]/[[Best Supporting Actress|Actress]] category.

A [[title role]] is often but not necessarily the lead. A lead role must also be differentiated from a starring role, which means that an actor is credited as a part of the main cast, but not that he necessarily plays the main character.

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}
[[libertarianism|Libertarians]] have differing opinions on the validity of [[intellectual property]].

==Political parties==
The [[Libertarian Party of Canada]] takes "a moderate approach to patents and copyrights", calling for "a careful review of existing and proposed legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111131447/https://www.libertarian.ca/platform-libertarian-party-canada |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anarcho-capitalist views ==

Since [[anarcho-capitalist]]s oppose the existence of even a minimal state, this ideological framework requires that any functions served by intellectual property law promulgation and enforcement be provided through private sector institutions.

[[Murray Rothbard]] argues for allowing contractually arising infinite copyright terms and against the need for any government role in protecting intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap15d.asp |title=Chapter 3 – Triangular Intervention |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that government's involvement in defining arbitrary limits on the duration, scope, etc. of intellectual property in order to "promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" is inherently problematic, since "By what standard do you judge that research expenditures are 'too much,' 'too little,' or just about enough?" He argues that intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation, since competitors can be indefinitely discouraged from further research expenditures in the general area covered by the patent because the courts may hold their improvements as infringements on the previous patent, and the patent holder is discouraged from engaging in further research in this field because the privilege discourages his improvement of his invention for the entire period of the patent, with the assurance that no competitor can trespass on his domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap10e.asp#7._Patents_Copyrights |title=Chapter 10 – Monopoly and Competition (continued) |publisher=Mises.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Morris and Linda Tannehill]] propose that ideas in the form of inventions could be registered in a privately owned "data bank"; the inventor could then buy insurance against the theft and unauthorized commercial use of the invention, and the insurance company would guarantee to not only compensate the inventor for any losses suffered due to such infringement but to stop such unauthorized use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Market for Liberty|pages=58–59|author=Tannehill, Morris and Linda|isbn=0-930073-08-8|chapter=Property – The Great Problem Solver|year=1993|publisher=Fox &amp; Wilkes|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents to intellectual property rights include [[Wendy McElroy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McElroy |first=Wendy |year=2011 |title=Contra Copyright, Again |url=http://libertarianpapers.org/wp-content/uploads/article/2011/lp-3-12.pdf |journal=Libertarian Papers |volume=3 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom G. Palmer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palmer |first=Tom G. |year=1990 |title=Are Patents and Copyrights Morally Justified? The Philosophy of Property Rights and Ideal Objects |url=http://tomgpalmer.com/wp-content/uploads/papers/palmer-morallyjustified-harvard-v13n3.pdf |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy |volume=13 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Lepage (economist)|Henri Lepage]], [[Boudewijn Bouckaert]], [[Jeffrey Tucker]], and [[N. Stephan Kinsella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bouillon |first=Hardy|editor-link1=Jörg Guido Hülsmann |editor1-first=Jörg Guido |editor1-last=Hülsmann |editor2-first=Stephan |editor2-last=Kinsella |title=Property, Freedom, and Society: Essays in Honor of Hans-Hermann Hoppe |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |year=2009 |page=157 |chapter=A Note on Intellectual Property and Externalities |isbn=978-1-933550-52-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella points out in ''Against Intellectual Property'' that patents may be inefficient since they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits. He notices that theoretical research can not be patented as easily as practical research and thus theoretical research is relatively underfunded. Moreover, he argues that property rights can only apply to resources that are scarce, which intellectual property is not. Kinsella also claims that the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kinsella |first=N. Stephan |year=2008 |title=Against Intellectual Property |url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Stephan%20Kinsella/Against%20Intellectual%20Property.pdf |publisher=Ludvig von Mises Institute |isbn=978-1-933550-32-9 |accessdate=2014-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David D. Friedman]] takes a neutral stance on intellectual property, claiming "there are good arguments on both sides of that question".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybell.com/exclusive-interviews/3771/Anthony-Wile-David-D-Friedman-on/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left-libertarian views ==

[[Roderick T. Long]] argues that the concept of intellectual property is not libertarian. He holds that prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]], and that since information exists in people's minds and other people's property, one cannot own information without owning other people. Claiming that authors and publishers will continue to produce absent copyright protection, he cites the fact that hundreds of thousands of articles are uploaded onto the Internet by their authors every day, available to anyone in the world for free and that nearly all works written before the 20th century are in the public domain, yet pre-1900 works are still published and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |title=The Libertarian Case Against Intellectual Property Rights |publisher=Libertariannation.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020914233356/http%3A//libertariannation.org/a/f31l1.html |archivedate=2002-09-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Tucker]], opposing intellectual property, writes, "...the patent monopoly...consists in protecting inventors...against competition for a period long enough to extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their services,{{spaced ndash}}in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a term of years in laws and facts of Nature, and the power to exact tribute from others for the use of this natural wealth, which should be open to all."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Tucker, ''Instead of a Book, By a Man Too Busy to Write One: A Fragmentary Exposition of Philosophical Anarchism'' (New York: Tucker, 1893), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ayn Rand's views ==

[[Ayn Rand]], founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], supported copyrights and patents, noting in ''[[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |authorlink=Ayn Rand |year=1966 |title=Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all property rights: a man's right to the product of his mind. Every type of productive work involves a combination of mental and of physical effort: of thought and of physical action to translate that thought into a material form. The proportion of these two elements varies in different types of work. At the lowest end of the scale, the mental effort required to perform unskilled manual labor is minimal. At the other end, what the patent and copyright laws acknowledge is the paramount role of mental effort in the production of material values; these laws protect the mind's contribution in its purest form the origination of an ''idea''. The subject of patents and copyrights is ''intellectual'' property. ... Thus the law establishes the property right of a mind to that which it has brought in existence.}}
She held that patent should be granted for limited terms only: 
{{cquote|If it were held in perpetuity, it would lead to the opposite of the very principle on which it is based: it would lead, not to the earned reward of achievement, but to the unearned support of parasitism.  It would become a cumulative lien on the production of unborn generations, which would ultimately paralyze them. Consider what would happen if, in producing an automobile, we had to pay royalties to the descendants of all the inventors involved, starting with the inventor of the wheel and on up.  Apart from the impossibility of keeping such records, consider the accidental status of such descendants and the unreality of their unearned claims.}}

== Other libertarian and anarcho-libertarian views ==

Anarchists such as [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[J. Neil Schulman]] have also argued for forms of intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;See: Kinsella, [http://c4sif.org/2015/10/classical-liberals-and-anarchists-on-intellectual-property/ Classical Liberals and Anarchists on Intellectual Property], which also lists other classical liberals and anarchists and their positions on intellectual property. Kinsella's post [http://c4sif.org/2015/04/pro-ip-anarchists-and-anti-ip-patent-attorneys/ Pro-IP “Anarchists” and anti-IP Patent Attorneys] lists some more recent anarchist libertarians in favor of intellectual property. For further discussion of the views of various libertarians on this matter, see his [http://c4sif.org/resources/ Anti-IP Resources], [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-four-historical-phases-of-ip-abolitionism/ The Four Historical Phases of IP Abolitionism], and [http://c4sif.org/2011/04/the-origins-of-libertarian-ip-abolitionism/ The Origins of Libertarian IP Abolitionism].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Improvisational theatre companies''', also known as '''improv troupes''' or '''improv groups''', are the primary practitioners of [[improvisational theater]]. Modern companies exist around the world and at a range of skill levels. Most groups make little or no money, while a few, well-established groups are profitable.

Although improvisational theater has existed in some form or another since the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gordon, ''Lazzi: The Comic Routines of the Commedia dell'Arte'' 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-933826-69-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern improv began with the teachings of [[Viola Spolin]] in Chicago, Illinois, USA and [[Keith Johnstone]] during the 1940-50s in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Improvisation for the Theater {{ISBN|0-8101-4008-X}} (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reddick, Grant. "Keith Johnstone," Theatre 100. Calgary: [[Alberta Playwrights Network]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Spolin's teachings led to the creation of [[The Compass Players]], the first modern improvisational theater company, in 1955. The presence of [[The Compass Players]], [[The Second City]], and [[ImprovOlympic]] in Chicago created a strength in the form within the city that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, David (September 3, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/03/arts/03impr.html "In Chicago, Honoring Athletes of Improv"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved January 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York City, New York|New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], and [[Toronto]] are other major hubs of improvisational theater in the [[North America]].

Many companies host [[List of improvisational theater festivals|improvisational theatre festivals]] or give improvisational theatre classes. Professional groups often perform a regular stage show acted by the most senior members. Along with this, they host "house" improv teams made up of improv students or graduates from their classes. In the past decade, professional improvisational theater groups have gradually started working more with corporate clients, using improvisational games to improve productivity and communication in the workplace.

'''Major Professional''' companies have branches in more than one city, have touring groups, and/or host large-scale improvisational comedy schools. '''Professional''' troupes are those not affiliated with a [[university]] or [[secondary school]]. '''Collegiate''' groups are those associated with a post-secondary educational institution. If a company performs more than one type of improvisational comedy, they are defined as using '''Multiple''' improvisational comedy types. If it is unclear what particular kind of improvisational comedy a group performs, they are defined as '''Improvisational'''. Those marked '''Semi-improvisational''' generally perform shows that are partially improvised and partially scripted.

The following is a '''list of noteworthy improvisational theatre companies'''&lt;ref group="nb" name="noteworthy"/&gt; from around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6684">The occult (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; In common [[English language|English]] usage, ''occult'' refers to "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]", as opposed to "knowledge of the [[measurable]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism'', Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; usually referred to as [[science]]. The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond [[Speculative reason|pure reason]] and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1888). ''The Secret Doctrine''. Whitefish, MT: [[Kessinger Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can also be used to describe the occult,&lt;ref&gt;Houghton Mifflin Company. (2004). ''The American Heritage College Thesaurus''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. Page 530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, C. F. (1895). An outline of the principles of modern theosophy. Boston: New England Theosophical Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural.

It also describes a number of [[magical organization]]s or orders, the teachings and practices taught by them, and to a large body of current and historical literature and spiritual philosophy related to this subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17029">'''Literary criticism''' ({{lang-fa|نقد ادبی}}) is a relatively young discipline in [[Iran]] since there had been no comparable tradition of [[literary criticism]] before the nineteenth century, when European influence first began to penetrate the country.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_13"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical tradition ==

[[Literary criticism]] in the [[Europe]]an sense never existed 

=== Pre-Islamic period ===

No text devoted to literary criticism has survived from the period before Islam. However, there is tantalizing mention of the titles of such works, such as ''Karvand''.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_13"/&gt; There is the possibility that Iranian elites were familiar with [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek literature]] and [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. Greek culture was cultivated during the [[philhellenism|philhellenic]] [[Parthia|Arsacid dynasty]], so much so that "in the courts of Arsacid kings Greek plays were performed in the original language".&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_13"/&gt; Even as late as the [[Sassanid Empire]], Greek philosophers took refuge in Iran in the academy at [[Gundeshapur]]. However, it remains a matter for speculation how much influence Greek ideas had on the literature of the period before [[Islam]].

=== Samanid period ===

The oldest surviving work of Persian literary criticism is the ''Muqaddamah-i Shāhnāmah-i Abū Manṣūrī'' (Introduction to Abū Manṣūr's ''Shāhnāmah''). "This work deals with the myths and legends of the ''Shāhnāmah'' and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During much of this period, commentary on poetry would take the form of either slander or excessive praise, that is "sophistry or exaggeration of trivial errors in the poetry of rivals."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The sarcastic remarks occasionally encountered in the poetry books... relating to rival poets are slanderous in nature and not genuinely critical. Conversely, when poets wrote favorably about each other, they merely exchanged flattery. Shahīd and [[Rudaki|Rūdakī]] admired one another and Rūdakī was praised by Kasā'ī, [[Abu-Mansur Daqiqi|Daqīqī]], Farrukhī, and ʿUnsurī; ʿUnsurī and Ghazā'irī, however, belittled each other's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Seljuq period ===

During the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq period]], with the growing influence of [[Arabic literature]] a more technical style of literary criticism (''naqd-i fannī'') became predominant.

''Tarjumān al-Balāghah'' by Muḥammad b. ʿUmar Rādūyānī "illustrates seventy-three types of rhetorical figures with Persian poems cited as examples in each case."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_16"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashīd al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Muḥammad Vaṭvāṭ in his ''Ḥadā'iq al-Siḥr'' gives "different definitions of rhetorical figures."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_16"/&gt; Kaykāvūs b. Iskandar in his ''Qābūs'nāmah'' says this of prose style: "In [[Arabic]] letters rhymed prose is a sign of distinction, whereas it is disapproved in letters written in Persian, and much better omitted. Let all the language you use be elevated, metaphorical, mellifluous and terse."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|pp=16–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most well-known classical works on literary criticism is ''Chahār Maqālah'' ("Four Essays") by [[Nizami Aruzi|Nizāmī ʿArūzī Samarqandī]], in which the author treats the "definition, essence, and purpose" of poetry.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_17"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mongol period ===

During [[Ilkhanate|this period]], the compilation of ''tazkirāt'' (anthologies sg. ''tazkirah'') produced "criticism of taste (''naqd-i zawqī'')"&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_17"/&gt; which really represented a return to the ''ad hominem'' attacks and rival name-calling which characterize much of what passes for literary criticism during most of Iranian history. "As with earlier periods, the practitioners of the criticism of taste belittled their predecessors in order to aggrandize themselves."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_17"/&gt; Muḥammad ʿAwfī wrote two of the most notable: ''Jawāmiʿ al-hikāyat'' and ''Lubāb al-albāb''.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_18"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawlatshāh Samarqandī's ''Tazkirāt al-shuʿarā'' "can be called the first true anthology of Persian poetry."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_19"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other ''tazkirāt'' of this period:

* ''Miʿyār al-ashʿār'', Khwājih Nāṣir al-Din Ṭūsī
* ''Ḥadā'iq al-ḥaqā'iq'' and ''Anīs al-ʿushshāq'', Sharaf al-Dīn Muḥammad b. Ḥasan Rāmī
* Essays by ʿAbd al-Rahmān Jāmī "noteworthy only for their vulgarity"&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_19"/&gt;

Some critics went against this trend. Shams-i Qays Rāzī wrote ''al-Muʿjam fī maʿāyir ashʿār al-ʿajam'' which is "the most comprehensive text of its kind to that date" and treats [[Prosody (poetry)|prosodic]] technique and terminology and poetic feet, rhyme, and criticism in two volumes.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_18"/&gt; 

=== Safavid period ===

The poetry of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid period]] is characteristic of what has since come to be known as ''[[sabk-i hindī]]'' ("Indian style,"&lt;ref&gt;See [[Amir Khusro|Amīr Khusraw Dihlavī]]&lt;/ref&gt; also called ''Ṣafavī'' or ''Iṣfahānī'' after the dynasty which nurtured it and its capital, respectively), marked by innovative and complex metaphor (as opposed to the simpler ''ʿIrāqī'' or ''[[Khorasani style (poetry)|Khurāsānī]]'' style of the earliest Persian poetry). Then, too, the primary literary critical works were ''tazkirāt'', most prominently ''Tuḥfah-i Sāmī'' by Sām Mīrzā.

A sharp rebuke to the ''sabk-i hindī'' occurred in the eighteenth century when some poets urged a return to the "purer, simpler, and more lucid diction" of earlier poets.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_21"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more prominent members of this group was Luṭf ʿAlī b. Āqā Khān Āzar Baygdilī, who compiled ''Ātashkadah''.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_21"/&gt; This reaction against Indian-style Persian poetry has continued to the present century, when even Western scholars such as [[Edward Granville Browne|E.G. Browne]] have dismissed this tradition. Riza Qulī Khān Hidāyat (born 1800) in the introduction to his ''Majmaʿ al-Fuṣaḥā'', writes the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Under the Turkomans and the Safavids, reprehensible styles appeared ... and since there were not binding rules for lyrics, the poets, following their sick natures and distorted tastes, began to write confused, vain, and nonsensical poems. They placed in their poetry insipid meanings instead of inspired truths, ugly contents ... instead of fine rhetorical devices and attractive innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Yarshater, Ehsan. "Safavid Literature: Progress or Decline," ''Iranian Studies'', vol. 7, 1974, pp. 240-242. Citing Hedayat, ''Majmaʿ al-Fusahā''. ed. Mazaher Mossafa, Tehran, 1336 Sh./1957, vol. 1, pp. 9-10, qtd. in {{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Qajar period ===

The [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]] is not known for any contributions to the ''classical'' tradition of literary criticism in Iran, but rather for the appearance of liberal social critics who are better treated in the context of the Iranian reform movement.

== Modern literary criticism ==

Starting in the nineteenth century, criticism of literature became bound up with criticism of all the "entrenched political and economic institutions".&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_23"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due largely to the encroachment of European political and cultural influence which undermined the traditional society of Iran.&lt;reference needed&gt;

=== Historical background ===

During the nineteenth century, Iranians for the first time felt the impact of the [[Industrialization|industrializing]] European powers. [[Russia]] incurred the first serious defeat against Iran by a European power during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)|Russo-Persian War]]. The [[Treaty of Gulistan]] ceded large parts of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to the [[Russian Empire]]. In [[Central Asia]], Russia and [[Great Britain]] were waging a [[Great Game|contest]] for influence and concessions. British interests in [[India]] compelled them to create the buffer state of [[Afghanistan]]. Iranian ambitions to recapture [[Herat]], were constantly frustrated during the [[Anglo-Persian War]] and the city has remained a part of Afghanistan ever since. At the same time, European sea-traffic had bypassed the ancient [[Silk Road]], which had been the backbone of Iran's economy since time immemorial. Traditional craftsmen could no longer compete with a flood of cheap, industrially produced goods from Europe. The nineteenth century was a traumatic period for much of the world as European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers stretched their possessions over the globe, and Iran was no exception.

In the midst of all these setbacks, many Iranians awoke to an urgent sense of the need for reform. More and more Iranians left Iran to study in Europe. Translations into Persian of Western works began to appear with greater frequency. Even the Qajar princes themselves, who were most threatened by these changes, attempted stillborn reforms of their own (usually military or industrial) in an attempt to "catch up" with the West. It is therefore no surprise that the criticism of literature at this time assumed a strongly social-reformist dimension.

=== Rationalism ===

The intellectual underpinning of the new criticism was possible because of the rise of rational, critical thought. The European thinkers most popular to the growing class of reformist intellectuals were those of the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[René Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton]]&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_23"/&gt; 

The [[Iranian reform movement]] can be seen in the context of the earlier movements in Europe and North America whereby "philosophers and thinkers arose ... who, through their criticism, challenged deeply seated superstition, ignorance and injustice."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_24"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An element common to these is the imagery of light (cf. [[Persian language|Persian]]: ''rawshan'fikr'' "enlightened") and dark:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The movement these thinkers set in motion stood as a bulwark in defense of knowledge, learning, and reform, and, through the promotion of understanding and wisdom, sought to dispel the ''darkness'' of superstition and ignorance.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_24"/&gt;[emphasis added]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Literary Critics ===

In the late Qajar period, from the late 19th century until the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]], several themes are common among the new literary critics.

# ''[[Realism (arts)|Realism]]'', or "social critical realism";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics discouraged imaginative or fanciful works and urged the production of literature which reflected real life.
# ''Patriotism''; critics appealed for the establishment of a strong national literature which would inspire patriotism in Iranians. Patriotism was considered a moral virtue and critics saw Iran's troubles grandly as the result of the decline in moral values.&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_33"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''"Protest"'';&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_33"/&gt; by this term what is meant is the graphic, vitriolic language used by these critics in their attacks. In this sense the modern critics really continue the classical critical tradition, if it could be so called, based on slandering rivals.
# ''Simplicity'', that is, "rejection of affectation and abstruseness [of] language";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics encouraged simple, clear prose and verse styles. 

For this generation of thinkers, Iranian backwardness was the result of its culture's decay. They sought to place attention on the shortcomings of Iran's literature, because they thought that by revitalizing it they could lay the ground for the revitalization of their society. "Such an approach, of course, ignores the fact that illiteracy and ignorance are the outward manifestations of a poor, backward, medieval economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mīrzā Fatḥ ʿAlī Ākhūnd'zādah ====

{{See also|Mirza Fath Ali Akhundzadeh}}

Considered  the "founder of modern literary criticism in Iran,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mīrzā Fatḥ ʿAlī Ākhūnd'zādah used literary criticism as "the vehicle for his reformist impulse."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_56"&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ākhund'zādah, because of his unfamiliarity with the Persian language and its prosody, made technical errors in some of his criticism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was just as verbose and incoherent as those he attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was the first critic in the modern tradition. He emphasized "realistic content in prose and poetry"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacked the "decadence of Persian literature — a literature that failed to address the social needs of its time."&lt;ref name="Parsinejad_56"/&gt; 

He published many works on literary criticism:
* ''Qirītīkah'' ("Criticism")
* ''Risālah-i īrād'' ("Fault-finding treatise")
* ''Fann-i kirītīkah'' ("Art of criticism")
* ''Darbārah-i Mullā-yi Rūmī va tasnīf-i ū'' ("On Rumi and his work")
* ''Darbārah-i nazm va nasr'' ("On verse and prose")
* ''Fihrist-i kitāb'' ("Preface to the book")
* ''Maktūb bih Mīrzā Āqā Tabrīzī'' ("Letter to Mīrzā Āqā Tabrīzī")
* ''Uṣūl-i nigārish'' ("Principles of writing")

Kirmānī emphasized "that it is meaning, not the mode of expression, that exerts the real influence on the reader,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus discouraged the "destruction of the natural clarity of language ... by means of complicated metaphors, difficult words, long sentences, and complex expressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Parsinejad|2003|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mīrzā Malkum Khān's [[Armenia]]n background and [[Christianity|Christian]] religion may have played a part in the simplicity of his Persian prose. In his most important literary-critical work, ''Firqah-i Kaj'bīnān'' ("the squint-eyed sect"), Malkum Khān lampooned the language of various classes of society and encouraged a more concise prose style.

The '''Mary Schenley Memorial Fountain''', also known as '''''A Song to Nature''''', is a 1918 landmark public sculpture in bronze and granite by [[Victor David Brenner]]. It sits in [[Schenley Plaza]] at the entrance to [[Schenley Park]] and directly in front of the [[University of Pittsburgh]]'s [[Frick Fine Arts Building]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]].  The fountain is designated as a contributing property to the [[Schenley Farms Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3a%3aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=bellefield%20hall&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=38544&amp;-find= University Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628170337/http://mac10.umc.pitt.edu/u/FMPro?-db=ustory&amp;-format=d.html&amp;-lay=a&amp;-sortfield=issueid%3A%3Aissuedate&amp;-sortorder=descend&amp;keywords=bellefield%20hall&amp;-max=50&amp;-recid=38544&amp;-find= |date=2009-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of art comprises two major figures: a reclining [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the [[Greek god]] of shepherds, and above him a female singer playing a [[lyre]]. From crevices along the fountain's rim four turtles spew water into the basin. An inscription on the pedestal reads, "A Song of Nature, Pan the Earth God Answers to the Harmony and Magic Tones Sung to the Lyre by Sweet Humanity." The basin of the fountain is 15 feet high, above which the figures rise another 15 feet.

The fountain honors [[Mary Schenley]]. In 1889, after intensive lobbying by [[Edward Manning Bigelow]], director of parks for the City of Pittsburgh, Schenley donated the land for the park named in her honor. Upon her death, Pittsburgh City Council sponsored a national competition for the memorial. The judges selected this design by Brenner, who is famous today for his design of the [[Penny (United States coin)|Lincoln cent]], which is still in circulation.

In June 2008, restoration efforts were begun that include repairs, cleaning, plumbing, paving, and landscaping.  A gift from the Benter Foundation will provide lighting for the fountain and plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/search/s_580089.html | title=Repairs under way on Schenley fountain | publisher = Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2008-07-30 | accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mind and Cosmos: Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature is Almost Certainly False''''' is a 2012 book by the philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]].

==Summary==
Nagel argues that the [[Materialism|materialist]] version of [[evolutionary biology]] is unable to account for the existence of [[mind]] and [[consciousness]], and is therefore at best incomplete. He writes that mind is a basic aspect of nature, and that any philosophy of nature that cannot account for it is fundamentally misguided.&lt;ref&gt;For the argument that mind is a basic aspect of nature, see {{harvnb|Nagel|2012|p=16ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the standard physico-chemical [[reductionist]] account of [[Abiogenesis|the emergence of life]] – that it emerged from a series of accidents, acted upon by the mechanism of [[natural selection]] – flies in the face of common sense.{{sfn|Nagel|2012|pp=5–6}}

Nagel's position is that principles of an entirely different kind may account for the emergence of life, and in particular conscious life, and that those principles may be [[Teleology|teleological]], rather than materialist or mechanistic. He stresses that his argument is not a religious one (he is an atheist), and that it is not based on the theory of [[intelligent design]] (ID), though he also writes that ID proponents such as [[Michael Behe]], [[Stephen C. Meyer]], and [[David Berlinski]] do not deserve the scorn with which their ideas have been met by the overwhelming majority of the scientific establishment.{{sfn|Nagel|2012|p=10}}

==Reception==

The book generated significant criticism, including from [[Steven Pinker]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Elliott Sober]].&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael|title=Where Thomas Nagel Went Wrong|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Where-Thomas-Nagel-Went-Wrong/139129/|website=The Chronicle Review|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliot. (2012). [http://bostonreview.net/books-ideas/remarkable-facts "Remarkable Facts: Ending Science as We Know It"]. ''[[Boston Review]]''. Retrieved July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Chorost]] wrote that Nagel raised valid criticisms but did not sufficiently engage with the large – though not dominant – body of scientific literature related to natural teleology. Chorost also suggests the book would have received less criticism had Nagel not endorsed criticisms raised by proponents of intelligent design, despite Nagel's not having endorsed intelligent design as a solution.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] negatively reviewed the book concluding "he advocates overthrowing things that are precisely defined, extremely robust, and impressively well-tested (the known laws of physics, natural selection) on the basis of ideas that are rather vague and much less well-supported (a conviction that consciousness can’t be explained physically, a demand for intelligibility, moral realism)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/08/22/mind-and-cosmos/ "Mind and Cosmos"]. Retrieved July 1, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13830">{{other uses|Motif (disambiguation)}}

'''Motif''' is a word used by folklorists who analyze, interpret, and describe the traditional elements found in the lore of particular [[folkloristics|folk groups]] and compare the folklore of various regions and cultures of the world based on these motif patterns. Ultimately, folklorists identify motifs in folklore to interpret where, how, and why these motifs are used, so they can understand the values, customs, and ways of life of unique cultures.

In cultural anthropology and [[folkloristics]], the meaning of ''motif'' encompasses the meanings of ''motif'' used in the areas of [[Motif (music)|music]], [[Motif (narrative)|literary criticism]], [[Motif (visual arts)|visual arts]], and [[Motif (textile arts)|textile arts]] because folklorists study motifs (i.e., recurring elements) in each of these areas, motifs that create recognizable patterns in [[folkloristics|folklore]] and folk-art traditions.

==Thompson’s ''Motif-Index''==

Folklorists also use ''motif'' to refer to the recognizable and consistently repeated [[Motif (narrative)|story elements]] (e.g., common characters, objects, actions, and events) that are used in the traditional plot structures, or [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|tale types]], of many stories and folktales. These motifs, which Dr. Margaret Read Macdonald calls “each small part of a tale,”&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"&gt;Read MacDonald, Margaret. 1982. The Storyteller’s Sourcebook: A Subject, Title, and Motif Index for Folklore Collections for Children (First Edition). Detroit: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; were indexed in 1932 by [[Stith Thompson]] and published as the ''Motif-Index of Folk-Literature''.&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"/&gt;

Thompson built upon the research of [[Antti Aarne]] (and the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|tale type index]] he created) when he compiled, classified, and numbered the traditional motifs of the mostly European folktale types in Aarne’s index and then cross referenced those motifs with Aarne’s tale types (Dundes).&lt;ref name="Dundes"&gt;Dundes, Alan. 1997. “The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique.” ''[[Journal of Folklore Research]]'' 34(3): 195–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklorist Alan Dundes explains that Stith Thompson’s “six-volume ''Motif-Index of Folk-Literature'' and the Aarne-Thompson tale type index constitute two of the most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis”.&lt;ref name="Dundes"/&gt;

Below is a sample of the index's headings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thompson|1946|loc=''The Folktale'', p.488-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparing motifs with tale types==

In the book ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_folktale.html?id=WKN44RtM_loC The Folktale]'', folklorist [[Stith Thompson]] explains how motifs and tale types are interrelated as he describes the role of one type of character found in many folk narratives, the helper:

:The '''chain of circumstances''' by which this helper joins the hero '''and certain details of his later experience''' are so uniform and well articulated as to '''form an easily recognizable motif, or rather cluster of motifs.''' This fact has caused some confusion to scholars who have not sufficiently distinguished between such a motif and the entire tale of which it forms only an important part. (emphasis added, 1977, 50)&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Stith. 1977. ''The Folktale''. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The same is true for any character or other motif. In fact, Thompson also explains that a single motif may be found in numerous folktales “from all parts of the earth” (383).&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

Thompson’s explanations show that the sequential order of motifs is also an important factor for folklorists to consider as they interpret individual motifs found in various folktale types used internationally.

==Accessing Thompson's ''Motif-Index''==

Many of the source texts in Thompson's ''Motif-Index'' are no longer currently in print. Dr. Margaret Read McDonald's ''Storytellers Sourcebook''&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"/&gt;  refers readers to stories in current books that also use motifs of folk literature. For example, Disney’s ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' contains many of the same traditional motifs that Read MacDonald points out in her preface to ''The Storyteller’s Sourcebook'' (e.g., Glass slipper, Cruel Stepmother, and Three-fold flight from ball) (x).&lt;ref name="Read Macdonald"/&gt;

==Other motif indices==
Many folklorists have produced extensive motif and tale-type indices for culture areas not covered by Thompson, or covered only to a limited extent. For surveys, see

==Special usage==
According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED''), folkloristic use of ''motif'' is not summed up in the definition for literary criticism (“Motif,” def. 3a), but deserves its own separate sense of this definition (“Motif,” def. 3b).&lt;ref&gt;“Motif.” Def. 3a and 3b. 2008. ''Oxford English Dictionary Online Database''. 3rd ed. Oxford,  Oxford UP, 1989. Brigham Young University. Web. 10 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the compound word ''motif index'' is used in [[cultural anthropology]] to denote “an index of standard motifs, esp. those found in folk tales” (''OED'', “Motif Index,” def. C2).&lt;ref&gt;“Motif Index.” Def. C2. 2008. Oxford English Dictionary Online Database. 3rd ed. Oxford,  Oxford UP. Brigham Young University. Web. 10 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Early Native American culture was rich with ceremonies, rituals and storytelling. These ceremonies had theatrical elements, but whether or not these traditions are early forms of modern-day theatre or are independent cultural practices is not clear. According to Henry Schafer, “A variety of rituals and ceremonies could be considered early forms of theatre….Others see this interpretation as a devaluation of sacred rituals as simply a pre-form of secular theatre.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Däwes | first=Birgit | title=Indigenous North American drama : a multivocal history | publisher=SUNY Press | publication-place=Albany | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4384-4660-8 | language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first practitioners of Native Theatre was a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; poet named [[E. Pauline Johnson|Emily Pauline Johnson]], who performed dramatic readings of her poems in the late nineteenth century. Other early contributors to the Native Canadian Theatre scene included a non-native named Anthony Walsh who directed the “Can-Oos-Sez Skay-loo Drama Group,” from 1934 to 1942, and Emily General (Cayuga), who established a series of annual plays to be performed at the Great Pine Forest Theatre on the Six Nations Reserve in 1949.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; In 1950, two non-Natives, Frank Morrison and Cecil West wrote and directed the opera ''Tzinquaw: The Thunderbird and the Killer Whale'', which premiered in Duncan, BC, performed by purely Native people. In Canada, playwrights James Reaney, John Herbert, and George Ryga made their contribution to Native theatre with ''The Ecstasy of Rita Joe'' (1970). Margo Kane (Saulteaux/Cree/Blackfoot) joined the production of ''The Ecstasy of Rita Joe'' in 1978 and became the first Native American actor to play the part of Rita Joe in 1981.

According to Henry Schafer, 1985-1995 was the “Golden Age” of Native Theatre.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; Many Native Theatre companies and playwrights emerged during this period. Tomson Highway (Cree) joined the Native Earth Performing Arts (NEPA), starting as a musical director and performer.  In 1985, Ondinnok Mythological Theatre was founded in Montreal by French-speaking Native playwright Yves Sioui Durand. Other Native Theatre companies that emerged during this period were: Tunooniq Theater, Awasikan Theatre, Urban Shaman and Native Youth Theatre R-Street Vision. In 1987, on the Hobbema Reserve, Four Winds Theatre Group was founded by Darrel and Lori Wildcat (Cree), along with cofounders Rosa and Melvin John. After the Four Winds Theatre Group closed in 1991, the Johns went on to form Kehewin Native Performance Resource Network (KNPRN). “KNPRN concentrates on traditional theatre, storytelling, and dance and works with young people, touring all over Canada and internationally.” (1) In 1992, Margo Kane founded Full Circle: First Nations Performance in British Columbia. Two of the most recent Native Theatre companies to emerge are Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company (1999) and Red Sky Performance in Toronto (2000). From 1995 to present day Native Theatre has struggled to maintain its size and popularity. One major issue the Native Theatre scene faced was lack of funding. Although some of the theatre companies closed and some still struggle to survive, the Native Theatre scene is continuing to develop and mature. “Even though Native theatre is a relatively recent phenomenon in Canada, it is by now an integral part of the Canadian cultural landscape. It takes on many forms and draws from various traditions like storytelling, European theatre, traditional dance, and multimedia. It resists any clear-cut definition and is constantly exploring new forms of expression.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt;

The stories that inspire Native American Theatre have been around for hundreds of years, but did not gain formal recognition by colonial America.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; This lack of recognition lasted until the 1930s when [[Lynn Riggs]], a playwright of [[Cherokee]] descent, brought Native Theatre into the spotlight through the Six Nations Reserve Forest Theatre in Ontario. Through these events, Native Theatre has been introduced to mainstream society and contemporary Native American Theater was born. Canadian playwright Drew Hayden Taylor explains how Native American theatre has been around for centuries, but has only recently been highlighted in North American mainstream media: “Native Theatre is much older than the scant few years. It is as old as this country, as old as the people who have been here for thousands of years, as old as the stories that are still told today. It is merely the presentation that has changed.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt;

Since the creation of contemporary Native American Theater, there have been plays available for publishing: “There are currently over 250 published and far over 600 unpublished plays by some 250 Native American and [[First Nations]] playwrights and theatre groups on the North American market.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; These numbers do not include the plays inside the ''North American Indian Drama'' collection as of 2006. Even though there is a large amount of plays available for production or analysis, the Native American drama genre is often overlooked by not only the general public, but also by universities. Shari Huhndorf states “drama remains the most overlooked genre in Native American literature.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; There needs to be more research and appreciation for Native American drama and its background. The lack of connection between plays from reservations and urban areas needs to improve in order for there to be more information from different angles and perspectives presented through dramatic literature. This can provide increased appreciation for Native American Theatre.

Contemporary Native American theater began in the 20th century and developed from oral culture and literature. These stories were used to “educate, entertain, and preserve” the new generations of the Native Americans. “However, indigenous theater was absent in Native writing during this period and the multiple reasons given for this nonexistence usually reflect a long history of silencing, discrimination, oppression, and displacement exercised in the genre.”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIDONÍ LÓPEZ and HANANE BENALI|first=|date=2016|title=NATIVE AMERICAN THEATER: A CONCISE HISTORY|url=|journal=miscelánea: a journal of english and american studies|volume=54|pages=93–111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories were usually told orally in a way accompanied by dancing, music, and other performances while the storyteller gets close to the audience to give them an immersive encounter of the story and the storyteller. These stories were usually exaggerated to give more drama for the audience. “This existence of this vibrant oral literature contrasts with the traditional Western conception that Native American cultures did not have history.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A non-Western historical record gave the misconception of Native Americans having no history before the arrival of European immigrants. Many Native American traditions and customs were suppressed due to colonization which prevented many from being able to tell their stories while they were oppressed. “The rise of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1960s and the 1970s also contributed to this reawakening of Native cultures since it appeared as a movement in which minorities demanded an end to discrimination and the right to speak for themselves.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This gave pride and encouraged many to seek inspiration from history and ancestral roots. Today there are many theater productions performing Native American works.

== Characteristics ==
According to Rolland Meinholtz, who is an “instructor and artistic director of drama and dance at the Institute of American Indian Arts,” youth must understand the struggles of Native American culture through contemporary plays.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous North American Drama|last=Meinholtz|first=Rolland|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=77–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; “They needed to know it, understand it, deal with it, struggle with it, hopefully integrate it, and lastly, build upon it.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to produce a play to convey a Native American themed message, you need dance, verse, drums, masks, facial painting. Even when the play consisted of non-Native Americans, Native American drama is all about the story and presentation, not about those who play the roles. “Nevertheless, there could be absolutely no question whose theatre we were witnessing. The spare setting, the drumming, the chanting and singing, the dancing, its episodic nature, and its wry point of view all proudly proclaimed this was Indian Theatre.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coyote is a metaphor to describe the character of Native American theater. Native American Theater production that does not fit into western conventions cannot easily be categorized as comedy or tragedy. Thus, the coyote trickster represents the shape shifting nature of Native Theater itself. “For Indian theatre, there is no clear division of comedy and tragedy as found, for example, in ancient Greek drama. Comedy and tragedy are one: one extreme transforming into the other. Everything humans perceive as fixed is actually transitory and subject to transformation.” According to Meinholtz Japanese Noh drama is a guide to achieving the spiritual goals he intended for Native American drama. Meinholtz is inspired by ancient Native American architecture to create contemporary theater spaces. “The Great Kivas were not the only examples of theatrical structures among Native Americans. The Zuni people build specifically designed rooms onto their houses in which to house the annual Shalako Ceremony.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenging Stereotypes ==
[[Geraldine Keams]] (Navajo Nation TV and film actress) disrupts Native American stereotypes in her work. Keams has challenges stereotypes through writing and creating plays that include Native American history, such as ''Flight of The Army Worm'', first performed in 1976 at [[Navajo Community College]]. ''Flight of the Army Worm'' is one of the first contemporary published plays that was done by a Native American Woman. Through ''Flight of The Army'' ''Worm'' Keams was able to educate others about the Navajo Nation. “The character of the announcer gives the audience factual information about historical events, while through song, the Guitar Player urges revolution. This combination of modes of presentation aims to sharpen spectator’s analysis of the historical events they see and hear about. Keams combines Western and Indigenous pedagogies by moving the story from the intellectual account by the announcer to the personal account of Grandmother.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drama by Contemporary Native American Women|last=Sullivan|first=Sharon|publisher=ProQuest|year=2004|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor|pages=34–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native Theater Movement was built from several theaters, like the American Indian theatre Ensemble, Thunderbird Theater, and [[Spiderwoman Theater]].&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"&gt;{{cite book | last=Haugo | first=Ann | title=A Companion to Twentieth-Century American Drama | chapter=Native American Drama | publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd | publication-place=Oxford, UK | date=November 21, 2007 | isbn=978-0-470-99680-5 | doi=10.1002/9780470996805.ch21 | pages=334–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theater companies helped consolidate a nationwide Native Theatre movement across the United States and Canada. Native American drama had to fight against indifference and lack of knowledge on the part of some mainstream audiences. Native American playwrights write for a larger audiences who may not be aware that Native Americans are a significant demographic. This creates a double burden on the need to educate as well as to create drama. The “Three Miguel sisters" founded the Spiderwoman Theater (1975); their drama has raised the public profile of figures and themes of traditional Native American stories. As more anthologies of contemporary Native American drama are published, the variety and creativity of the contemporary scene has become more apparent. “Just the fact that you’re on the stage telling these stories is political, just the fact that you’re there…it is a public act claiming one's native identity is a political act.”&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt; The Native American Theatre Ensemble (1973) presented Native Americans on their own terms to combat stereotypical Indian misrepresentations.

Native American playwrights challenge centuries of stereotypes to create realistic characters conceived from their own personal experiences. The American Indian Theater Ensemble resolved to not only to rectify the cultural image of the Native American, but also to produce a body of drama intended primarily for the Indian community. “The purpose of making the company pan-tribal was to deconstruct stereotypes.”&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt; [[Hanay Geiogamah]] was active in the founding years of the American Indian Theatre Ensemble, which produced his one-act play ''Body Indian''. ''Body Indian'' is pan-tribal work that demonstrates the problems Native American playwrights face in creating realistic drama based on contemporary Native American life. While Native people have been performing on the stages of the American theatre since the nineteenth century, at the turn of the twenty-first century, only a handful of articles on Native Theatre have been published, and most appeared in magazines rather than academic journals. Scholars in Canada embraced First Nations theatre more quickly, with much of the scholarship during the 1990s appearing in Canadian journals and published by Canadian presses. Now, twenty years later, Native and non-Native scholars seek to redefine the place of Indigenous theatre within the history of "American" theatre or, more accurately, the theatre of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt;

== Influence ==
Indigenous American cultures have been a major aspect of Chicano drama.&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilmer | first=S. E. | title=Native American performance and representation | publisher=University of Arizona Press | publication-place=Tucson | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-8165-0240-0 | pages=155–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicano/playwrights have been inspired by [[Native American mythology]] and history through the use of symbolism and characters to represent Chicano/as, who are considered to be descendants of indigenous Mexico. Before the end of the Mexican War (1848), Mexico consisted of both Texas and California. The use of symbols in Chicano/a plays range from the use of characters being in the play on stage or “at other times the Indio is imagined through the use of Indigenous music, flutes, and drums.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; These symbols provide information that is not easily seen and influence the action of the play and were influenced by the Chicano/an’s indigenous roots.

In the play Day of the Swallows, Estela Portillo Trambley uses an Indigenous male character to represent the protagonist’s Native American roots. The main character appears as the “noble savage” who represents the Indio in the play and Eduardo is paired with a contrasting character, Josefa, who is connected to her heritage and is traditionally feminine. Josefa’s connection to her heritage in this play “is through images that only she can see and feel.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; This play uses these visions as symbols that are influenced by their indigenous heritage. “Eduardo symbolizes the best and the worst of humanity in Josefa’s world, for he is Nature personified as Man.” ''Mummified Deer'' was written in 1984 by Luis Valdez. His character Cajeme, a deer dancer named after a famous Yaqui who fought against the Mexican government, is portrayed through different elements in the play. “Cajeme represents her inner thoughts, her fears, her Yaqui blood and being.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; These plays were written to reconnect Chicanos with their Native American roots.

Estela Portillo Trambley and Luis Valdez were the most well-known authors of the Indigenous Chicano drama. They were the early proponents of bringing indigenous roots into Chicano/a plays. Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; Trambley is “regarded by most Chicano/critics and scholars as the author who inspired and opened the doors for all the Chicana writers who followed her.” Both of these playwrights used their own style while writing their individual plays. Trambley focused more on writing in the style of realism, which was more general with no indication of specific indigenous people, while Valdez wrote and produced in more specifics communities as well as by using “a surreal vision of the Chicano’s distorted postmodern, internally colonized condition.” Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt;

[[File:The Nativity Robert Campin.jpg|thumb|420px|[[Robert Campin]], c. 1420, ''Nativity''. [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]]]]

'''''Nativity''''' is a 1420 panel painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Robert Campin]]. The work is noted for distilling three episodes from the life of Christ into a single panel, rather than presenting them in [[triptych]] format. The scenes are, from left to right, the birth of Christ, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the [[adoration of the shepherds]]. The painting is harshly realistic; the Child Jesus and his parents are shown in poverty; the figures crowd within a single space shared with animals, in a room with a thatched roof with a hole and broken-down walls. In this Campin abandons the traditional narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin]] is presented as in her teens, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] as a much older man. Four angels hover above them, holding gifts. Two of them hold a banner with lettering addressed to midwives in the lower portion of the panel; it reads "Tangue puerum et sanabaris" (''touch the child and you shall be healed''). From the little record we have of Campin, he was a major pioneer and innovator of painting, and here his appeal to the poverty of the Holy Family. His skill with oil paint is reflected in the positioning of the central figures in the extreme foreground, giving the panel a very tight and focused feel, despite the highly detailed background details and landscape.&lt;ref name="r24"&gt;Rothstein, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The hut is slanted compared to the outline of the frame, a device later adopted by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] in his [[Bladelin Altarpiece]].&lt;ref name="b18"&gt;Blum, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Campin places a landscape complete with a view of a lake beyond of the stable, just above the two midwives. Reinforcing the idea of redemption, [[Salome]] is given a prominent position, facing outwards towards the viewer in the mid foreground.&lt;ref name="r24"/&gt;

The panel is housed in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]].

'''''Nautilus''''' is a black-and-white photograph taken by [[Edward Weston]] in 1927 of a single [[nautilus]] shell standing on its end against a dark background. It has been called "one of the most famous photographs ever made" and "a benchmark of modernism in the history of photography."&lt;ref name=Sotheby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?sale_number=N08624&amp;live_lot_id=122 |title=Sotheby's: Edward Weston - Nautilus|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
In February, 1927, Weston visited the studio of local [[Carmel-by-the-Sea|Carmel]] artist [[Henrietta Shore]] and noticed several paintings she had made of sea shells. Only one of these paintings is known to still exist (as of January, 2011), and it shows a stark and solitary nautilus on a dark field, not unlike Weston's resulting photographs.&lt;ref name=Aiken&gt;{{cite journal|first =Roger |last=Aikin  |date=Winter 1992 | title =Henrietta Shore and Edward Weston| journal =American Art | volume =6 | issue =1  | pages =42–61 | doi=10.1086/424140}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it clear in his writings that the paintings had a profound effect on him:

{{quote|I was awakened to shells by the painting of Henry [Henrietta Shore]. I never saw a Chambered Nautilus before. If I had, my response would have been immediate. If I merely copy Henry's expression, my work will not live. If I am stimulated and work with real ecstasy it will live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward |last=Weston|editor=Nancy Newhall |title= The Daybooks of Edward Weston, Volume II|publisher=NY: Horizon Press |year=1961| pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Photographing==
Within a month he began photographing several different large chambered nautiluses, either whole or cut in half to reveal their inner structure.  He used his Ansco 8 × 10 Commercial view camera with a Rapid Rectilinear lens stopped down to US256 (equivalent to f/64) . Notations he made about his exposures during this period indicate that the film he used would be rated approximately equivalent to 16 on today's [[Film speed|ISO scale]].&lt;ref name=Newhall&gt;{{cite book| first=Beaumont |last=Newhall|title=" Edward Weston's Technique", in Edward Weston Omibus|publisher=Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith|year=1984|ISBN=0-87905-131-0|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the technical limitations of the film and the camera he used, he was forced to make extremely long exposures that were easily ruined by vibrations. Weston's grandson [[Kim Weston]] said his grandfather propped up the shell on the end of an oil drum (the arc of the drum can barely be seen in the background of the image),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.beautiful-landscape.com/Thoughts24.html |title=Notes on Photographing a - Nautilus|accessdate=2011-01-05|first=Brian |last=Pawlowski}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the thin metal oil drum head was sensitive to the slightest movement. Weston expressed his frustrations in his 'Daybooks'':

:Wednesday, June 15: "Yesterday I tried again: result, movement! The exposure was 4{{fraction|1|2}} hours, so to repeat was no joy, with all the preoccupation of keeping quiet children and cat, ‒ but I went ahead and await development."

:The next day: "The shells again moved! It must be the heavy trucks that pass jar the building ever so slightly. Anyway, I have quit trying: I can afford no more film." &lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p28&lt;/ref&gt;

He recorded that over the next several months he made fourteen negatives of shells. It's not known exactly when he took this particular image, but it had to have been made between April 1 and June 8, 1927, when he recorded in his journal "Last evening I had printed, and am ready to show all shell negatives…".&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

''Nautilus'' is now recognized as one of Weston's greatest photographs, but all of his images of shells have a greater-than-life quality to them. Weston biographer Ben Maddow has said that what is so remarkable about them "is not in the closeness nor in the monumentality of the forms; or at least, not in these alone. It is instead in the particular light, almost an inward luminescence, that he saw implicit in them before he put them before the lens. Glowing with an interior life . .. one is seeing more than form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Den |last=Maddow |title= Edward Weston: Fifty Years|publisher=NY: Aperture|year=1973| page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One historian wrote "The nautilus shells proved a turning point in Weston’s career and marked a critical phase in his development as one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century, a pioneering modernist whose stunning simplicity and technical mastery are often imitated but never quite equaled." &lt;ref name=Sotheby2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photoinduced.com/144/edward-weston-exhibit/ |title=Debunking the Myth of Edward Weston |first=Deborah |last=Hornblow |accessdate=2011-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113135932/http://www.photoinduced.com/144/edward-weston-exhibit/ |archivedate=2011-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Much has been said about Weston's intentions in photographing shells.  He recorded that some of the first people to see them had intensely erotic reactions:

:[[Tina Modotti]]: Edward ‒ nothing in art has affected like these photographs. I cannot look at them very long without feeling exceedingly perturbed, they disturb me not only mentally but physically. There is something so pure and at the same time so perverse about them…, They are mystical and erotic."&lt;ref name="DB II 31"&gt;Daybooks, II, p31&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Diego Rivera]] (as described by Tina Modotti): "These photographs are biological, beside the aesthetic emotion they disturb me physically, ‒ see my forehead is sweating. Then ‒ 'Is W. very sensual?'"&lt;ref name="DB II 31"/&gt;

:[[Rene d'Harnoncourt]] (as described by Tina Modotti): "Without my saying a word he used 'erotic' also. Like me, he expressed the disturbance these prints caused in him. He felt 'weak at the knees'."&lt;ref name="DB II 31"/&gt;

At the same time, Weston strongly denied in his writings that he had any thought, much less intention, of recording erotic symbolism:

:"No! I had no physical thoughts, ‒ never have. I worked with clearer decision of sheer aesthetic form. I knew I was recording from within, my feeling for life as I never has before. Or better, when the negatives were actually developed, I realized what I felt, ‒ for when I worked, I was never more unconscious of what I was doing.

:No! The Shells are too much a sublimation of all of my works and life to be pigeon-holed. Others must get from them what they bring to them: evidently they do!"&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p32&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, in another entry about one of his nude images he said "I saw the repeated curves of thigh and calf, ‒ the shin bone, knee and thigh lines forming shapes not unlike great sea shells…"&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Weston wrote that he made twenty-eights prints of this image on at least four different types of paper,&lt;ref name=Conger&gt;{{cite book|first=Amy |last=Conger|title= Edward Weston: Photographs from the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Tucson: Center for Creative Photography |year=1992| pages=Fig. 544}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a matte Kodak Azo and a semi-gloss Agfa Convira. In a few early versions he extended the bottom margin of the image down to the notches on the film negative.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, Fig. 544&lt;/ref&gt; Most prints measure approximately 9{{fraction|1|2}} by 7{{fraction|1|2}} in. (24 by 19&amp;nbsp;cm.)

On April 13, 2010, a print of this image made by Weston in year it was taken sold for $1,082,500 at an auction in New York. As of January, 2013, it was the fourteenth [[List of most expensive photographs|most expensive photograph]] ever sold. Weston originally sold it for $10.

Prints of this image are now in the collections of the [[Center for Creative Photography]], the [[George Eastman House]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21275">'''One City One Book''' (also '''One Book One City''', '''''[City]'' Reads''', '''On the Same Page''' and other variations) is a generic name for a community reading program that attempts to get everyone in a city to read and discuss the same book. The name of the program is often reversed to One Book One City, or is customized to name the city where it occurs. Popular book picks have been [[Harper Lee]]'s ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', [[Ernest Gaines]]'s ''[[A Lesson Before Dying]]'', [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', and [[Rudolfo Anaya]]'s ''[[Bless Me, Ultima]]''.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html |title="One Book" Reading Promotion Projects |accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher=Library of Congress - Center for the Book |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501024447/http://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;
The book chosen for the program was 'The Sweet Hereafter' by [[Russell Banks]], written in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting On The Same Page -- Library's 'If All Of Seattle Read The Same Book' Program Hopes To Get The City Reading - And Talking - Together |first=Ferdinand M. |last=De Leon |newspaper=Seattle TImes |date=November 5, 1998 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981105&amp;slug=2781661 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities copied the idea, and the Library of Congress listed 404 programs occurring in 2007.&lt;ref name = "LOC" /&gt;

Each city's program has its own goals; these typically include building a sense of community and promoting literacy.&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
Nancy Pearl warns against expecting too much from a program: "Keep in mind that this is a library program, it's not an exercise in civics, it's not intended to have literature cure the racial divide. This is about a work of literature."&lt;ref name = "LJ2002" /&gt;

Programs typically involve more than having everyone read the same book. Some other activities that have been included are: book discussion sessions, scholarly lectures on the book or related topics, a visit by the author, exhibits, related arts programming (especially showing a movie of the book if there is one), and integration into school curricula.&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide"&gt;

In Boston the "[[One City One Story]]" program used shorter stories and distributed tens of thousands of free copies of the story over the course of a month.

[[American Library Association]] puts out a detailed step-by-step guide&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide" /&gt; on how to organize a local program, including the critical step of picking the one book. The [[Center for the Book]] at the [[Library of Congress]] tracks all known programs and the books they have used.&lt;ref name = "LOC" /&gt;

=== Significant "One Book" programs ===
''Most listed are in the United States, perhaps because the meme started there and similar programs elsewhere have a different name.''

Programs sponsored by public libraries are tracked each year by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;At [http://www.read.gov/resources/state.php Read.gov]. Retrieved Jun 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Most programs maintain their own websites devoted to the annual effort.

Colleges

Some colleges have begun One College One Book programs in addition to the more common summer reading programs for incoming First Year students. The Department of Elementary and Early Childhood Education at the College of New Jersey has been running a One Book, One Department program for all of the students in its major since 2008, requiring students to read a common work of literary non-fiction in both summer and winter breaks. The first book used was Ann Fadiman's The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down and the book for summer 2014 is Dan Fagin's Pulitzer Prize winning Toms River.

==== United Kingdom ====

[http://cityreads.co.uk/ City Reads], Brighton is the longest running and most consistent 'big read' in the UK. Led by artistic director [https://about.me/sarah.hutchings Sarah Hutchings], it is delivered by award-winning literary organisation [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113311/http://cityreads.co.uk/about/collected-works-cic%20Collected%20Works%20CIC Collected Works CIC]. City Reads is an annual collective reading festival conceived to spread a love of books and ideas to the widest possible audience throughout Brighton &amp; Hove, with a healthy reach into the South East region. Over three weeks in October one book is chosen for the whole community to creatively engage with in a series of special events, workshops and performances. Through the outstanding quality of its work, its ability to foster collaboration and the partnerships that support the Festival, City Reads brings regional and national attention to the importance of shared reading and the benefits it can bring to the whole community. 2015 marks the 10th anniversary of City Reads, Brighton. The City Reads slogan is: '''''One city. One book. A thousand conversations...''''' The Festival began in 2005 when the City celebrated Penguin Books' 70th Anniversary and read Lewis Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland''. In 2013, with the support of writer, broadcaster and former children's laureate Michael Rosen Young City Reads was launched. Working with primary aged children at KS2 level, Young City Reads is thought to be the first 'big read' for children in the UK, on such a large scale.

Southampton University:
One Book, One Southampton (OBOS) is the University of Southampton’s initiative to engage with our community through reading. Similar initiatives have been trialled in other institutions internationally, but there are very few UK University One Book programmes. The University encourage staff, students and our local and international community to join us in debates, lectures, talks and online forums to discuss OBOS and explore the themes, subjects and debates that the book raises. You can listen to discussions on the subject, and attend events about the book. The University of Southampton announced that the 2014 book will be Empire by Jeremy Paxman.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.soton.ac.uk/onebook/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternate programs ===
Some cities that have run independent One Book programs have later joined Big Read instead.  An annual "One World, Many Stories" summer reading campaign for children, which has a single selection for the country, has become popular as well.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://ca.evanced.info/lapl/sr/homepage.asp?ProgramID=4 Los Angeles], 
[http://hmcpl.org/2011/05/embark-your-summer-reading-journey Huntsville], and [http://www.idahokidsread.org/ Idaho] libraries. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709145617/http://ca.evanced.info/lapl/sr/homepage.asp?ProgramID=4 |date=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical responses ==

For some, the mere idea of reading as a communal activity is repellent. The literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] said, "I don't like these mass reading bees.... It is rather like the idea that we are all going to pop out and eat Chicken McNuggets or something else horrid at once."&lt;ref name = "NYT2002Fight"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are concerned about the temptation to use such a program to promote social values. [[Phillip Lopate]] fears a promotion of [[groupthink]], saying "It is a little like a science fiction plot -- 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or something."&lt;ref name = "NYT2002Fight " /&gt;

In [[New York City]] in 2002, the effort foundered when the selectors split into two rival groups, each with its own favorite: [[Chang-Rae Lee]]'s ''[[Native Speaker (novel)|Native Speaker]]'' and [[James McBride (writer)|James McBride]]'s ''[[The Color of Water]]''. Both books were considered to be offensive to some of New York's ethnic groups.&lt;ref name = "LJ2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT2002"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Nancy Pearl said,
"It's turned into something not to do with literature but to do with curing the ills in society, and while there is a role for that, to ask a book to fit everybody's agenda in talking about particular issues just does a disservice to literature."&lt;ref name = "Guardian2002"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments are sometimes concerned that their endorsement of reading a book will be viewed as endorsing the ideas or language of the book. In Texas in 2006, the [[Galveston County]] Reads committee recommended [[Mark Haddon]]'s ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' as the choice for their county-wide read. There was much criticism of the choice from the Mayor and Council of [[Friendswood]], who objected to obscenity in the novel, and said that it contained ideas that should not be promoted to kids and that taxpayer money should not be used to promote and purchase a book the community wouldn't approve of.&lt;ref name = "Galveston"&gt;

==History==
Osborne &amp; Little was established by [[Sir Peter Osborne, 17th Baronet|Sir Peter Osborne]] (father of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician [[George Osborne]]) and his brother-in-law Antony Little.&lt;ref name="Observer Lutyens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutyens|first1=Dominic|title=Blow the Budget|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/homes-osborne-and-little|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Observer|date=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's shop, in the [[King's Road]], [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], put it in the heart of [[Swinging London]].&lt;ref name="Indie McSmith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McSmith|first1=Andy|title=George Osborne: A silver spoon for the golden boy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/george-osborne-a-silver-spoon-for-the-golden-boy-2004814.html|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Independent|date=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little was the designer – he had been responsible for [[Biba]]'s distinctive black and gold logo – and created most of the company's early ranges.&lt;ref name="Observer Lutyens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutyens|first1=Dominic|title=Blow the Budget|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/homes-osborne-and-little|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Observer|date=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand-printed papers were inspired by everything from the designs of [[Aubrey Beardsley]] to the [[Brighton Pavilion]]&lt;ref name="Observer Lutyens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutyens|first1=Dominic|title=Blow the Budget|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/homes-osborne-and-little|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Observer|date=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indie McSmith"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McSmith|first1=Andy|title=George Osborne: A silver spoon for the golden boy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/george-osborne-a-silver-spoon-for-the-golden-boy-2004814.html|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Independent|date=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success in reinterpreting classic designs in new ways during the 1970s and '80s meant that Little soon presided over a large design team. In the book ''Twentieth Century Pattern Design'', Lesley Jackson described the brand as distinctive for its bold reinterpretations of traditional patterns, adding: "historical references tend to be lateral rather than literal".&lt;ref name="20c pattern Jackson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Lesley|title=Twentieth Century Pattern Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c93jEZwcfPoC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Osborne+and+Little+%2B+Twentieth+Century+Pattern+Design&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=25qMBYTG18&amp;sig=Hz7_-EawZkcdqCkqLJEW5poC7W0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KzvBU573L4jDO76ZgaAO&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Osborne%20and%20Little%20%2B%20Twentieth%20Century%20Pattern%20Design&amp;f=false|date=2007|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=9781568983332|page=203|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
The company took over [[Isabel Tisdall|Isabel Tisdall's Tamesa Fabrics]] in 1985 and later acquired the distribution rights to Lorca fabrics and Liberty Furnishings.&lt;ref name="20c pattern Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Schoeser"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schoeser|first1=Mary|title=Isabel Tisdall|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/oct/12/guardianobituaries.fashion|accessdate=12 July 2014|issue=12 October 2007|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a longstanding association with interior designer Nina Campbell, distributing her collections.&lt;ref name="DT Sinclair"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sinclair|first1=Emma|title=Feminine wiles: Nina Campbell and those heart-shape glasses|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/9811794/Feminine-wiles-Nina-Campbell-and-those-heart-shape-glasses.html|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotsman NC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff|title=Interview: Nina Campbell, interior designer|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/interview-nina-campbell-interior-designer-1-476003|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Scotsman|date=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has a wholly owned US subsidiary and showrooms across Europe, in addition to retailing via UK stores such as [[John Lewis Partnership|John Lewis]].&lt;ref name="DT Russell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Jonathan|title=George Osborne's family firm in fourth annual loss|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9763971/George-Osbornes-family-firm-in-fourth-annual-loss.html|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its high-profile clients have included [[Hillary Clinton|Bill and Hillary Clinton]], who used Osborne &amp; Little designs in their private apartment at the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="Observer Lutyens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutyens|first1=Dominic|title=Blow the Budget|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/homes-osborne-and-little|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Observer|date=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was formerly listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]], delisting in 2003; it had a turnover of almost £33m in 2011, with a quarter of this coming from sales in [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]].&lt;ref name="DT Tyler"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tyler|first1=Richard|title=George Osborne's family business makes a loss as the weak economy takes its toll|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/yourbusiness/8973704/George-Osbornes-family-business-makes-a-loss-as-the-weak-economy-takes-its-toll.html|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little retired from the business in 2005 and Osborne remains CEO. Former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] George Osborne retains a shareholding in the company.&lt;ref name="Observer Lutyens"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lutyens|first1=Dominic|title=Blow the Budget|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jul/12/homes-osborne-and-little|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Observer|date=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ES LD"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Londoners' Diary|title=George Osborne's tax crusade should begin at home|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/george-osbornes-tax-crusade-should-begin-at-home-7636724.html|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=London Evening Standard|date=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax 'deferral'==
The company recorded a pre-tax profit of £722,000 on turnover of £34&amp;nbsp;million in 2014/5. The highest paid director, possibly Peter Osborne, was paid £684,000.{{fact|date=January 2016}}  Using the 2014/15 UK income tax calculator reveals this would result in combined income tax and national insurance deductions of £310,838.28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salaryis.com/calculator/ |title=Salary Calculator Pro: 2016/17 Income Tax Calculator |publisher=Salaryis.com |accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 it was revealed by ''[[Private Eye]]'' that, despite having made a pre-tax profit of £722,000, the company paid no corporation tax for the year 2015 – thereby avoiding a "tax bill" of £179,000.&lt;ref name="imgur1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i.imgur.com/Uqiz77s.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028211437/http://i.imgur.com/Uqiz77s.jpg |archivedate=28 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=January 2016}} The magazine also revealed that the company had not paid any corporation tax since 2008 and had even received a tax credit of £12,000 in the year 2010.&lt;ref name="imgur1"/&gt;{{fact|date=January 2016}} This was due to the company making losses totalling £9&amp;nbsp;million between 2009 and 2014, which allow the carry forward of credits for losses against the 2015 corporation tax bill. Despite these substantial losses, the companies' directors collected £1.2million in the year 2012 alone.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2014/jan/06/osborne-little-george-family-wallpaper-firm |title=Osborne &amp; Little: is George's humble family wallpaper firm in trouble? &amp;#124; Politics |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, owns a 15% stake in the company, which is estimated to be worth between 15 and 30 million pounds.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

==Design collaborations==
Osborne &amp; Little has collaborated with a number of other British fashion and textile designers over the years, including [[Zandra Rhodes]], [[Neisha Crosland]] and [[Matthew Williamson]].&lt;ref name="20c pattern Jackson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Red  NC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff|title=Women in interiors: Neisha Crosland's top tips for autumn/winter 2011|url=http://www.redonline.co.uk/red-women/red-panel/women-in-interiors/neisha-crosland-tips-aw11|accessdate=12 July 2014|publisher=Red|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vogue Milligan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Lauren|title=The prince of prints takes over your home|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2013/08/28/matthew-williamson-interiors-wallpaper-fabric-osborne-little|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=Vogue|date=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masopust držíme 10.jpg|upright=1.2|thumbnail|Peruehty in [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. 1910]]
'''Perchta''' or '''Berchta''' (English: '''[[Bertha]]'''), also commonly known as '''Percht''' and other variations, was once known as a [[goddess]] in [[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions|Alpine paganism]] in the Upper German and Austrian regions of the [[Alps]]. Her name may mean "the bright one" ([[Old High German]] ''beraht, bereht'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''brehtaz'') and is probably related to the name ''Berchtentag'', meaning [[Epiphany (holiday)|the feast of the Epiphany]]. [[Eugen Mogk]] provides an alternative etymology, attributing the origin of the name ''Perchta'' to the [[Old High German]] verb ''pergan'', meaning "hidden" or "covered".&lt;ref&gt;Mogk according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perchta is often identified as stemming from the same [[Germanic paganism|Germanic]] goddess  as [[Holda]] and other female figures of German folklore (see [[Frija-Frigg]]). According to [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Lotte Motz]], Perchta is Holda's southern cousin or equivalent, as they both share the role of "guardian of the beasts" and appear during the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]], when they oversee [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HiltonMotz"&gt;Motz according to Hilton 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Grimm says Perchta or Berchta was known "precisely in those Upper German regions where Holda leaves off, in Swabia, in Alsace, in Switzerland, in Bavaria and Austria."&lt;ref name=Grimm272&gt;Grimm, 1882:272.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Erika Timm]], Perchta emerged from an amalgamation of Germanic and pre-Germanic, probably [[Celts|Celtic]], traditions of the Alpine regions after the [[Migration Period]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Timm according to Natko.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names of Perchta ==
Perchta had many different names depending on the era and region: Grimm listed the names ''Perahta'' and ''Berchte'' as the main names (in his heading), followed by ''Berchta'' in Old High German, as well as ''Behrta'' and ''Frau Perchta''. In [[Baden]], [[Swabia]], [[Switzerland]] and Slovenian regions, she was often called ''Frau Faste'' (the lady of the [[Ember days]]) or [[Pehta]] or 'Kvaternica', in [[Slovene language|Slovene]]. Elsewhere she was known as ''Posterli,'' ''Quatemberca'' and ''Fronfastenweiber''.&lt;ref name="Ginzburg"&gt;&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;Ginzburg&lt;!--Year &amp; page?--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In southern [[Austria]], in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] among the Slovenes, a male form of Perchta was known as ''Quantembermann'', in German, or ''Kvaternik'', in Slovene (the man of the four [[Ember days]]). Grimm thought that her male counterpart or equivalent is ''[[Berchtold]].''&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:279.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional variations of the name include ''Berigl'', ''Berchtlmuada'', ''Perhta-Baba'', ''Zlobna Pehta'', ''Bechtrababa'', ''Sampa'', ''Stampa'', ''Lutzl'', ''Zamperin'', ''Pudelfrau'', ''Zampermuatta'' and ''Rauweib''.

==Depiction==
In some descriptions, Perchta has two [[shapeshifting|forms]]; she may appear either as beautiful and white as snow like her name, or as elderly and haggard.

In many old descriptions, Perchta had one large foot, sometimes called a goose foot or swan foot. Grimm thought the strange foot symbolized her being a higher being who could [[shapeshift]] to animal form. He noticed that Bertha with a strange foot exists in many languages (Middle German "Berhte mit dem fuoze", French "Berthe au grand pied", Latin "Berhta cum magno pede", Italian " Berta dai gran piè", title of a medieval epic poem of italian area): "It is apparently a [[swan maiden]]'s foot, which as a mark of her higher nature she cannot lay aside...and at the same time the spinning-woman's splayfoot that worked the [[treadle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Grimm 1882:280&amp;ndash;81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tyrol she appears as little old woman with a very wrinkled face, bright lively eyes, and a long hooked nose; her hair is disheveled, her garments tattered and torn.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

== Traditional narratives ==
Initially, Perchta was the upholder of cultural taboos, such as the prohibition against [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] on holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/30035166?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Smith, John B. "Perchta the Belly-Slitter and Her Kin: A View of Some Traditional Threatening Figures, Threats and Punishments." ''Folklore'' 115.2 (2004): 167-86]&lt;/ref&gt; In the folklore of [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]], Perchta was said to roam the countryside at midwinter, and to enter homes during the twelve days between Christmas and Epiphany (especially on the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]]). She would know whether the children and young servants of the household had behaved well and worked hard all year. If they had, they might find a small silver coin the next day, in a shoe or pail. If they had not, she would slit their bellies open, remove their stomach and guts, and stuff the hole with straw and pebbles.  She was particularly concerned to see that girls had spun the whole of their allotted portion of [[flax]] or wool during the year.&lt;ref name="Frazer240"&gt;Frazer 1920:240.&lt;/ref&gt; She would also slit people's bellies open and stuff them with straw if they ate something on the night of her feast day, other than the traditional meal of fish and gruel.&lt;ref name=Grimm272/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frazer240"/&gt;

The cult of Perchta, under which followers left food and drink for ''Fraw Percht'' and her followers in the hope of receiving wealth and abundance, was condemned in Bavaria in the ''Thesaurus pauperum'' (1468) and by [[Thomas Ebendorfer]] von Haselbach in ''De decem praeceptis'' (1439).

Later canonical and church documents characterized Perchta as synonymous with other leading female spirits: [[Holda]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Herodias]], [[Richella]] and [[Abundia]].

== Related beings ==
[[Image:Perchtenmaske.jpg|thumb|right|190px|A ''Perchten'' mask]]

Grimm thought [[Holda]] is her equivalent while the [[Weisse Frauen]] may derive directly from Berchta in her white form.

The word ''[[Pre-Christian Alpine traditions#Perchten|Perchten]]'' is plural for '''Perchta''', and this has become the name of her entourage, as well as the name of animal masks worn in parades and festivals in the mountainous regions of Austria. In the 16th century, the Perchten took two forms: Some are beautiful and bright, known as the ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten"). These come during the Twelve Nights and festivals to "bring luck and wealth to the people." The other form is the ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") who have fangs, tusks and horse tails which are used to drive out demons and ghosts. Men dressed as the ugly Perchten during the 16th century and went from house to house driving out bad spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer 1920:242-243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;Wagner 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, ''[[The Devil|der Teufel]]'' is viewed as the most ''schiach'' ("ugly") ''Percht''  and ''Frau Perchta'' as the most ''schön'' ("beautiful") ''Percht''.

In Italy, Perchta is roughly equivalent with [[Befana|La Befana]], who visits all the children of Italy on the night before 6 January to fill their socks with candy if they are good or a lump of coal if they are bad.&lt;ref&gt;Illes, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
According to [[Jacob Grimm]] (1882), Perchta was spoken of in [[Old High German]] in the 10th century as '''Frau Berchta''' and thought to be a white-robed goddess who oversaw spinning and weaving, like the myths of [[Holda]].  He believed she was the feminine equivalent of [[Berchtoldstag|Berchtold]], and was sometimes the leader of the [[Wild Hunt]]. However, John B. Smith disagrees and suggests that Perchta represents the personification of the feast of the Epiphany (Perchta's Day), and is therefore not pre-Christian.&lt;ref name=Hopkin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7A_XAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=perchta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0u82l3ozOAhXKaD4KHVgXCJkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Hopkin, David. "Folklore and the Historian", ''The Folklore Historian'', Vol. 17, Simon Bronner, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern celebrations==
In contemporary culture, Perchta is portrayed as a "rewarder of the generous, and the punisher of the bad, particularly lying children".&lt;ref name=Hopkin/&gt;
  
Today in Austria, particularly [[Salzburg]], where she is said to wander through [[Hohensalzburg Castle]] in the dead of night,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tBM6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA563&amp;lpg=PA563&amp;dq=perchta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8Yfmva8mcM&amp;sig=BsxUJZK-txAVoOjjm5mGzJ5TVUo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV-Pnl2ozOAhXGbj4KHaVRDoU4MhDoAQgpMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=perchta&amp;f=false Vivian, Mrs. Herbert. "The Perchten Dancers of Salzburg", ''The Wide World Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly of True Narrative, Adventure, Travel, Customs and Sport'', Vol. 21, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt; the Perchten are still a traditional part of holidays and festivals (such as the Carnival [[Fastnacht]]). The wooden animal masks made for the festivals are today called ''Perchten''.&lt;ref name="Wagner"/&gt;

In the [[Pongau]] region of Austria large processions of ''Schönperchten'' ("beautiful Perchten") and ''Schiachperchten'' ("ugly Perchten") are held every winter. Beautiful masks are said to encouraging financial windfalls, and the ugly masks are worn to drive away evil spirits.&lt;ref name=Gallon&gt;[http://www.iga.stir.ac.uk/showblog.php?id=186 Gallon, Stephanie. "Christmas Demons II - Krampus and Perchta", International Gothic Association, December 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other regional variations include the ''Tresterer'' in the Austrian [[Pinzgau]] region, the stilt dancers in the town of [[Unken]], the ''Schnabelpercht'' ("trunked Percht") in the [[Unterinntal]] region and the ''Glöcklerlaufen'' ("bell-running") in the [[Salzkammergut]]. A number of large [[Ski resort|ski-resort]]s have turned the tradition into a [[tourist]] attraction drawing large crowds every winter.

:''For the concept of protasis in linguistics, see [[Conditional sentence]].''
In [[drama]], a '''protasis''' is the introductory part of a play, usually its first act. The term was coined by the fourth-century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] grammarian [[Aelius Donatus]]. He defined a play as being made up of three separate parts, the other two being [[epitasis]] and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. In modern [[dramatic theory]] the term [[Dramatic_structure|dramatic arc]] has substantially the same meaning&lt;ref&gt;https://makingmusic.ableton.com/dramatic-arc&lt;/ref&gt;, though with slightly different divisions.

'''Robert Mapplethorpe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|p|əl|ˌ|θ|ɔr|p}}; November 4, 1946 – March 9, 1989) was an American [[photographer]], known for his sensitive yet blunt treatment of controversial subject-matter in the large-scale, highly stylized black and white medium of photography. His work featured an array of subjects, including celebrity portraits, male and female [[Nude (art)|nudes]], self-portraits and still-life images of flowers. His most controversial work is that of the [[BDSM]] subculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s of [[New York City]].  The [[homoeroticism]] of this work fuelled a national debate over the public funding of controversial artwork.

==Biography==
Mapplethorpe was born in [[Floral Park, Queens]], New York City, the son of Joan Dorothy (Maxey) and Harry Irving Mapplethorpe, an electrical engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1701327|title=Mapplethorpe, Robert|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was of [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Germans|German]] descent, and grew up as a [[Roman Catholic]] in Our Lady of the Snows Parish. He had three brothers and two sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/04/robert-mapplethorpe-bad-boy-with-a-camera/|title=Robert Mapplethorpe: bad boy with a camera|work=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied for a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from the [[Pratt Institute]] in [[Brooklyn]], where he majored in Graphic Arts,&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, Grace. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DE1E3EF936A15755C0A963958260 "Fallen Angel"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 25, 1995. Accessed October 14, 2007. "Growing up in a blue-collar precinct of Floral Park and steeped in Catholicism, Mapplethorpe developed&amp;nbsp;— to his alarm&amp;nbsp;— an adolescent interest in [[gay]] [[pornographic]] magazines&amp;nbsp;... So, at Pratt Institute, where his father had studied Engineering and Robert majored in Graphic Arts (but stopped short of getting a degree)&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; though he dropped out in 1969 before finishing his degree.&lt;ref&gt;Haggerty, George. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L9Mj7oHEwVoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Gay%20histories%20and%20cultures%3A%20an%20encyclopedia%20%20By%20George%20E.%20Haggerty&amp;pg=PA561#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Gay histories and cultures"]&lt;/ref&gt; Mapplethorpe lived with his close friend [[Patti Smith]] from 1967 to 1972, and she supported him by working in bookstores. They created art together, and maintained a close relationship.

[[File:Gene Frankel Theater 24 Bond Street.jpg|thumb|right|Mapplethorpe's studio at 24 [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]] in [[Manhattan]], later kept by him for use as a darkroom]]

Mapplethorpe took his first photographs in the late 1960s or early 1970s using a [[Polaroid camera]]. In 1972 he met art curator [[Sam Wagstaff]] who would become his mentor and lifetime companion.  In the mid-1970s Wagstaff acquired a [[Hasselblad]] medium-format camera and Mapplethorpe began taking photographs of a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, including artists, composers, and socialites.  During this time, he became friends with [[New Orleans]] artist [[George Dureau]], whose work had such a profound impact on Mapplethorpe that he restaged many of Dureau's early photographs.  From 1977 until 1980, Mapplethorpe was the lover of writer and [[Drummer Magazine (leather)|''Drummer'' magazine]] editor [[Jack Fritscher]],&lt;ref&gt;Jack Fritscher, ''Gay San Francisco: Eyewitness Drummer'', San Francisco, Palm Drive Publishing, 2008, {{ISBN|1890834386}}, p. 473, [http://www.jackfritscher.com/PDF/Drummer/Vol%201/33_Mineshaft_Mar2008_PWeb.pdf Jackfritscher.com], retrieved September 29, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; who introduced him to [[Mineshaft (gay club)|Mineshaft]].

By the 1980s Mapplethorpe's subject matter focused on statuesque male and female nudes, delicate flower still lifes, and highly formal portraits of artists and celebrities.  Mapplethorpe's first studio was at 24 [[Bond Street (Manhattan)|Bond Street]] in Manhattan.  In the 1980s, Wagstaff bought a top-floor loft at 35 West 23rd Street for Robert, where he resided, also using it as a photo-shoot studio.&lt;ref name=Morrisroe&gt;Morrisroe, Patricia. Robert Mapplethorpe: a biography. New York: Random House, 1995. pgs. 297, 126 {{ISBN|0-394-57650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He kept the Bond Street loft as his darkroom.  In 1988, Mapplethorpe selected Patricia Morrisroe to write his biography, which was based on more than 300 interviews with celebrities, critics, lovers, and Mapplethorpe himself.&lt;ref name=Morrisroe/&gt;

===Death===
Mapplethorpe died on the morning of March 9, 1989 at the age of 42 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS]], in a [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] hospital.  His body was cremated.  His ashes are interred at [[St. John Cemetery (Queens)|St. John's Cemetery, Queens]] in [[New York City|New York]], at his mother's grave-site, etched "Maxey".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

=== Foundation ===
Nearly a year before his death, the ailing Mapplethorpe helped found the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, Inc.  His vision for the Foundation was that it would be "the appropriate vehicle to protect his work, to advance his creative vision, and to promote the causes he cared about".&lt;ref name="mfoundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapplethorpe.org/foundation.html|title=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation - Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since his death, the Foundation has not only functioned as his official estate and helped promote his work throughout the world, but has also raised and donated millions of dollars to fund medical research in the fight against AIDS and HIV infection and to promote fine art photography at the institutional level.&lt;ref name="mfoundation" /&gt; The Foundation also determines which galleries represent Mapplethorpe's art.&lt;ref name="Duray2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Duray|first=Dan|title=Mapplethorpe Estate to OHWOW in Los Angeles|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/11/mapplethorpe-estate-to-ohwow/|work=Observer.com|publisher=The New York Observer|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation - FAQ|url=http://www.mapplethorpe.org/faq/|work=mapplethorpe.org|publisher=The Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation donated the Robert Mapplethorpe Archive, spanning from 1970 to 1989, to the [[Getty Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Mapplethorpe Archive|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/special_collections/notable/mapplethorpe.html|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==

Mapplethorpe worked primarily in a studio, and almost exclusively in black and white, with the exception of some of his later work and his final exhibit "New Colors". His body of work features a wide range of subjects, but his main focus and the greater part of his work is erotic imagery. He would refer to some of his own work as [[pornographic]],&lt;ref name=Morrisroe /&gt; with the aim of arousing the viewer, but which could also be regarded as [[high art]].&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;Arthur Coleman Danto and Mapplethorpe, Robert. Mapplethorpe. New York: Random House, 1992. Print. pg 326&lt;/ref&gt; His [[erotic art]] explored a wide range of sexual subjects, depicting the [[BDSM]] subculture of New York in the 1970s, portrayals of black male nudes, and [[nude (art)|classical nudes]] of female bodybuilders. Mapplethorpe was a participant observer for much of his erotic photography, participating in the sexual acts which he was photographing and engaging his models sexually.&lt;ref name=Whitney/&gt;

Other subjects included flowers, especially orchids and [[Zantedeschia aethiopica|calla lilies]], children, statues, and celebrities and other artists, including [[Andy Warhol]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]], [[Kathy Acker]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Amanda Lear]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Philip Glass]], [[David Hockney]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Joan Armatrading]] and [[Patti Smith]]. Smith was a longtime roommate of Mapplethorpe and a frequent subject in his photography, including a stark, iconic photograph that appears on the cover of Smith's first album, ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]''.&lt;ref name=bestcovers&gt;{{cite book |title=100 Best Album Covers: The Stories Behind the Sleeves |last=Thorgerson |first= Storm |author2=Aubrey Powell  |edition=1st American |date=November 1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=0-7894-4951-X |pages=74 |ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=71kBAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work often made reference to religious or classical imagery, such as a portrait of Patti Smith &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/Image-Library/Mapplethorpe/tate_photo-patti-smith-1975.jpg Georgetown.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; from 1986 which  recalls [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1500 self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgetown.edu/faculty/irvinem/visualarts/Image-Library/Exempla/durer-self-portrait-1500-lg.jpg Georgetown.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1980 and 1983, Mapplethorpe created over 150 photographs of bodybuilder [[Lisa Lyon]], culminating in the 1983 photobook ''Lady, Lisa Lyon'', published by [[Viking Press]] and with text by Bruce Chatwin.

{{quote|text=Robert took areas of dark human consent and made them into art. He worked without apology, investing the homosexual with grandeur, masculinity, and enviable nobility. Without affectation, he created a presence that was wholly male without sacrificing feminine grace. He was not looking to make a political statement or an announcement of his evolving sexual persuasion. He was presenting something new, something not seen or explored as he saw and explored it. Robert sought to elevate aspects of male experience, to imbue homosexuality with mysticism.

==Controversy==

===''The Perfect Moment'' (1989 solo exhibit tour)===
In the summer of 1989, Mapplethorpe's traveling solo exhibit brought national attention to the issues of public funding for the arts, as well as questions of censorship and the obscene. The [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., had agreed to be one of the host museums for the tour. Mapplethorpe decided to show his latest series that he explored shortly before his death. Titled ''Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment'', the show included photographs from his X Portfolio, which featured images of [[urophagia]], [[BDSM]] and a self-portrait with a [[bullwhip]] inserted in his anus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V110/N31/mapple.31a.html|title=Robert Mapplethorpe's extraordinary vision - The Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was curated by Janet Kardon of the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia|Institute of Contemporary Art]] (ICA).&lt;ref name=ICA&gt;[http://www.icaphila.org/news/pdf/mapplethorpe_pr.pdf ''Imperfect Moments: Mapplethorpe and Censorship Twenty Years Later'', Institute of Contemporary Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icaphila.org/exhibitions/mapplethorpe.php|title=ICA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICA was awarded a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to support Mapplethorpe's exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. The cancellation of the show, which terminated the Corcoran's contract with the ICA, was due to the fact that the museum did not want to get involved in the politics. Instead, the Corcoran was pulled into the controversy, which "intensified the debate waged both in the media and in Congress surrounding the NEA's funding of projects perceived by some individuals... to be inappropriate..."&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Judith. "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Philadelphia Story." Art Journal 50.4 (1991): 71-76. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy of the Corcoran and several members of [[United States Congress|the U.S. Congress]] were upset when the works were revealed to them, due to the [[homoerotic]] and [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] themes of some of the work. Though much of his work throughout his career had been regularly displayed in publicly funded exhibitions, conservative and religious organizations, such as the [[American Family Association]], seized on this exhibition to vocally oppose government support for what they called "nothing more than the sensational presentation of potentially obscene material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC153FF934A2575BC0A966958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Mapplethorpe's Photos Now an F.C.C. Issue | date=August 17, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1989, [[pop art]]ist [[Lowell Blair Nesbitt]] became involved in the censorship issue. Nesbitt, a long-time friend of Mapplethorpe, revealed that he had a $1.5-million bequest to the museum in his will, but publicly promised that if the museum refused to host the exhibition, he would revoke the bequest. The Corcoran refused and Nesbitt bequeathed the money to the [[Phillips Collection]] instead. After the Corcoran refused the Mapplethorpe exhibition, the underwriters of the exhibition went to the nonprofit [[Washington Project for the Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html ''The Sensitive Society'', James F. Fitzpatrick, FCLJ Vol 47 No 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613072721/http://www.law.indiana.edu/fclj/pubs/v47/no2/fitzpat.html |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed all the images in its space from July 21 to August 13, 1989, to large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73897099.html?dids=73897099:73897099&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+6%2C+1989&amp;author=Judd+Tully&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=b.01&amp;desc=Corcoran+Cut+From+Painter%27s+Will%3BLowell+Nesbitt%27s+Mapplethorpe+Protest|title=Corcoran Cut From Painter's Will|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpadc.org/catalyst/?p=2845|title=Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, the [[Contemporary Arts Center]] in Cincinnati, and [[Dennis Barrie]], were charged with obscenity. They were found not guilty by a jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jackfritscher.com/OtherAnthology/CensorshipEncyclopedia.html|title=Censorship: A World Enclyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ICA, "The Corcoran's decision sparked a controversial national debate: Should tax dollars support the arts? Who decides what is "obscene" or "offensive" in public exhibitions? And if art can be considered a form of [[free speech]], is it a violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to revoke federal funding on grounds of obscenity? To this day, these questions remain very much at issue."&lt;ref name=ICA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The federal government and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography. However, the exact definition of obscenity and pornography has changed over time. (See also [[I know it when I see it]].)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mapplethorpe became something of a [[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]] for both sides of the American [[culture war]]. However, prices for many of the Mapplethorpe photographs doubled and even tripled as a consequence of all the attention. The artist's notoriety supposedly also helped the posthumous sale at [[Christie's]] auction house of Mapplethorpe's own collection of furniture, pottery, silver and works by other artists, which brought about $8 million.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck (April 16, 1990), [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/arts/publicity-is-enriching-mapplethorpe-estate.html Publicity Is Enriching Mapplethorpe Estate] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Central England incident===
In 1998, the [[Birmingham City University|University of Central England]] was involved in a controversy when a book by Mapplethorpe was confiscated. A final-year undergraduate student was writing a paper on the work of Robert Mapplethorpe and intended to illustrate the paper with a few photographs from ''Mapplethorpe'', a book of the photographer's work. She took the photographs to the local chemist to be developed and the chemist informed West Midlands Police because of the unusual nature of the images. The police confiscated the library book from the student and informed the university that the book would have to be destroyed. If the university agreed to the destruction, no further action would be taken.

The university Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Peter Knight, supported by the Senate, took the view that the book was a legitimate book for the university library to hold and that the action of the police was a serious infringement of academic freedom. The Vice-Chancellor was interviewed by the police, under caution, with a view to prosecution under the terms of the [[Obscene Publications Acts]].

After the interview with the Vice-Chancellor, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service for a determination by the Director of Public Prosecutions whether to proceed with a trial. After a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when Dr. Knight was informed by the DPP that no action would be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |title=UCE pages on the Mapplethorpe controversy |accessdate=2002-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990209055420/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |archivedate=February 9, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Black Book''===
The 1986 solo exhibition "Black Males" and the subsequent book ''The Black Book'' sparked controversy for their depiction of black men. The images, erotic depictions of black men, were widely criticized for being exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/Mappleth/MappPg1.html|title=Mapplethorpe - Richard Meyer Essay|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mapplethorpe_r.html Mapplethorpe, Robert (1946-1989)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321074911/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/mapplethorpe_r.html |date=2006-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobena Mercer "Looking for Trouble" Transition, No. 51 (1991), pp. 184-197&lt;/ref&gt; The work was largely [[Phallus|phallocentric]] and sculptural, focusing on segments of the subject's bodies. His purported intention with these photographs and the use of black men as models was the pursuit of the [[Platonic ideal]].&lt;ref name=Morrisroe /&gt; Mapplethorpe's initial interest in the black male form was inspired by films like ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'' and the interrogation scene in ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]],'' in which an unknown black character enters the interrogation room and slaps the protagonist across the face.&lt;ref&gt;Fritscher, Jack. Mapplethorpe: assault with a deadly camera : a pop culture memoir, an outlaw reminiscence. Mamaroneck, NY: Hastings House, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism was the subject of a work by American conceptual artist [[Glenn Ligon]],'' Notes on the Margins of the Black Book'' (1991–1993). Ligon juxtaposes Mapplethorpe's 91 images of black men in the 1988 publication ''Black Book'' with critical texts and personal reactions about the work to complicate the racial undertones of the imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Audio Guide Stop For Glenn Ligon, Notes on the Margins of the Black Book, 1991-1993, [http://whitney.org/WatchAndListen/Artists?context=&amp;context_id=&amp;play_id=376 Whitney Museum of American Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

American poet and activist [[Essex Hemphill]] also expressed criticism in his anthology ''Brother to Brother'' (1991). Although he believed that Mapplethorpe's work reflected exceptional talent, Hemphill also believed that it displayed a lack of concern for black individuals in the gay community, "except as sexual subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin (2014). ''Hold Tight Gently: Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill and the Battlefield of AIDS''. New York: [[The New Press]]. pp. 169-170. {{ISBN|978-1-59558-945-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumously==
In 1992, author [[Paul Russell (novelist)|Paul Russell]] dedicated his novel ''Boys of Life'' to Mapplethorpe, as well as to Karl Keller and [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Paul|title=Boys of Life|year=1991|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0525933274|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''Mapplethorpe: A Biography'' by Patricia Morrisroe was published by Random House in 1995,&lt;ref name=Morrisroe/&gt; the ''Washington Post Book World'' described it as "Mesmerizing... Morrisroe has succeeded in re-creating the photographer's world of light and dark."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post Book World, May 28, 1995, ''In the Darkroom of the Soul''.&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Arthur Danto|Arthur C. Danto]], writing in ''The Nation'', praised it as "utterly admirable... The clarity and honesty of Morrisroe's portrait are worthy of its subject."&lt;ref&gt;''The Unretouched Life'', The Nation, June 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Patti Smith]] wrote a book ''[[The Coral Sea (book)|The Coral Sea]]'' dedicated to Mapplethorpe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Patti|title=The Coral Sea|year=1996|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York, NY|isbn=0393039080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philips]] released a photo disc for their [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] video game system in the late 1990s called ''The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flowers of Robert Mapplethorpe (CD-i) James &amp; Mike Mondays|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECVdnmjrfyc|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1999, Arena Editions published ''Pictures,'' a monograph that reintroduced Mapplethorpe's sex pictures. In 2000, ''Pictures'' was seized by two [[South Australian]] plain-clothes detectives from an [[Adelaide]] bookshop in the belief that the book breached indecency and [[obscenity|obscenity laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extract from: HANSARD, S.A. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Wednesday 14 March 2001|url=https://www.efa.org.au/Publish/samapplethorpe.html|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Police sent the book to the [[Canberra]]-based [[Australian Classification Board|Office of Film and Literature Classification]] after the state Attorney-General's Department deftly decided not to get involved in the mounting publicity storm. Eventually, the OFLC board agreed unanimously that the book, imported from the United States, should remain freely available and unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pictures (book), Australian Classification,|url=http://www.classification.gov.au/Pages/View.aspx?sid=F%252f37FixyCCJcNEJG4I%2b02g%253d%253d&amp;ncdctx=JDFqlp0uaVsihc3foKMDfEhVT6%2b2q3UflUkULkMQKD8SlYvwJ2n1ovo%252fFwAGtion|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, American writer, director, and producer [[James Crump]] directed the documentary film [[Black White + Gray (2007 film)|''Black White + Gray'']], which premiered at the 2007 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

'''Roosevelt Red Ware''', also known as '''Salado Red Ware''' and '''Salado Polychrome''', is a late prehistoric [[pottery]] tradition found across large portions of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]]. The [[archaeological culture|tradition]] involves the combination of red, white, and black [[paint]] in varying configurations along with compositional and morphological characteristics.  This ceramic tradition begins about AD 1280-1290 and lasts until at least AD 1450 based on [[Dendrochronology|tree-ring]] dating.

==History==
[[Archaeologist]]s have argued over the nature of Salado as a cultural phenomenon or an ideological one spreading through the Southwest.  Some archaeologists have chosen to use the term Salado Polychromes so as not to give undue emphasis to the Roosevelt Lake area, once thought to be the center of production. Both terms, Salado Red Ware and Roosevelt Red Ware are still used by archaeologists.

In her 1994 volume, Dr. Patricia Crown suggested four models with which to analyze Salado Polychromes.  They are "elite symbols of authority or items of exchange," "indicators of participation in an economic alliance/regional system," "objects associated with the spread of a religious ideology," and as "markers of ethnicity for a migrant group" (Crown 1994: vi). More recently archaeologists have examined these types distribution across the Southwest (Lyons 2003) and suggests that these types are markers of migrant groups emanating from northeastern Arizona.

==Ceramic typology==
Roosevelt Red Ware is divided by archaeologists into a series of [[Typology (archaeology)|types]], which cover shorter spans of time, based on configurations of the painted designs and rim profiles of bowls.
Roosevelt Red Ware has traditionally been organized into three types based on stylistic differences. More recently researchers at [http://www.archaeologysouthwest.org/ Archaeology Southwest] (previously named the Center for Desert Archaeology) in Tucson, Arizona have identified an additional six types based on a combination of stylistic and morphological characteristics. For bowls with both interior and exterior decoration, the exterior style is labeled as the variant (Example: Gila interior with a Tonto exterior would be labeled as Gila Polychrome: Tonto Variant)

All types within this ware share a number of broad categorical similarities although over a roughly 250 year time span significant variation is seen. The paste is generally brown to reddish-brown in color and is tempered with sand. Generally red and/or white slip cover both the interior and exterior and black paint is used on one or both surfaces, usually surrounded by white rather than red slip. Black paint is most commonly organic, but a mixture of organic and mineral paint appears on some vessels. Petrographic analyses have shown that Roosevelt Red Ware is produced across the full distributional range.

===Pinto Polychrome===
Pinto Polychrome is the earliest of the Roosevelt Red Wares and dates from AD 1280 to 1330. Pinto Polychrome vessels are only found in the form of bowls and lack the banding line, also called a "life-line" by some authors, that identify Gila Polychrome. Stylistically Pinto Polychrome is reminiscent of St Johns Polychrome in its layout of opposed hatched and solid elements, although the type exhibits a period of experimentation with colors and layouts that continue through subsequent types.

Pinto polychrome is found along the [[Mogollon Rim]] in Arizona as well as the [[Tonto Basin]], [[Sierra Ancha]], [[Globe Highlands]], [[San Pedro Valley (Arizona)|San Pedro Valley]], [[Point of Pines Sites|Point of Pines Area]], [[Kinishba Ruins|Kinishba Area]] and the [[Upper Gila Valley]] (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 34).

There is a transitional variant that has been noted by some authors known as Pinto-Gila Polychrome. This type exhibits the more bold designs generally found in Gila Polychrome but lacks the banding line and is still only found in bowls. Some authors have chosen not to use this type arguing that types tend to blur in transitional periods between types and that adding types adds no additional analytical usefulness. Pinto Polychrome is also contains a Salmon Variety (see Gila Polychrome).

===Pinto Black-on-red===
Similar in dates, designs, and geographic distribution to Pinto Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint.

===Gila Polychrome===
[[File:Tonto polychrome jar.jpg|thumb|right|Tonto Polychrome jar (olla), Tonto National Monument]]
Gila Polychrome is the first type in this series to be found in both bowls and jars. Stylistically Gila Polychrome is identified by bolder motifs than Pinto Polychrome and bowls are most readily identified by the banding line just below the interior rim. Jars have broad stripes of white slip with black designs, although the bases are usually still slipped red. Sometimes jars exhibit multiple parallel bands of black on white decoration separated by thin bands of red slip. Gila Polychrome, Salmon Variety, replaces the usual white slip with a pinkish slip but otherwise remains stylistically similar (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 21-22).

Gila Polychrome is produced from about AD 1300-1450 across Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico, north of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua.

===Gila Black-on-red===
Similar in dates, designs and geographic distribution to Gila Polychrome but without the white slip underlying black paint.

===Tonto Polychrome===
Tonto Polychrome is found in higher frequencies on jars. The black on white designs are generally narrower bands than on Gila jars, or panels of decoration, and are surrounded by red slip. This type has a later starting date than Gila Polychrome, AD 1340 and an end date of 1450.

===Cliff Polychrome===
[[Image:Cliff_Bowl.png|thumb|right|Cliff Polychrome Bowl]]
Cliff Polychrome is identified by stylistic and morphological characteristics that distinguish it from Gila Polychrome.  Dates given for this type range from AD 1300-1450 (Lyons 2004).

This type is found in bowl form and can be partially identified by recurved and semi-flaring rims. Accompanying the shift in bowl shape is a drop in the banding line, creating a secondary design field between the banding line and the rim. Design elements otherwise are similar to those found on Gila and Tonto Polychrome vessels.

Lyons (2004) describes the spatial distribution for this type as ranging from [[Petrified National Forest]], Arizona to [[Casas Grandes]], Chihuahua, Mexico and from the Phoenix basin to [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]. The locus of heaviest production for this type seems to be centered around southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico possibly indicating the location of origin for this type. Temporal distribution would seem to indicate that this type is temporally significant since sites exist throughout the distributional range containing both Gila and Tonto Polychrome, but lacking Cliff Polychrome.

===Nine Mile Polychrome===
Nine Mile Polychrome is similar to Cliff Polychrome in that it only occurs in bowls with a recurved rim with a black-on-white band of design on the bowl interior just below the rim, the area above the banding line on Cliff Polychrome. Unlike Cliff Polychrome however, the rest of the interior of this type is red slipped without any additional elaboration, including lack of a banding line. Generally Nine Mile Polychrome vessels have either a Gila or Tonto Polychrome exterior decoration. This type is found in the region from the Cliff Valley to Perry Mesa, and from the Middle Verde Valley to the area around Douglas, Arizona.  While rare, this type seems to have its greatest density around the far southeastern portion of its distribution. This type dates from the timer period AD 1375-1450 (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).

This type is named for the Nine Mile Site in the [[San Simon Valley]] excavated by Jack and Vera Mills in the 1940s.

===Phoenix Polychrome===
Phoenix Polychrome also occurs only in bowls with recurved rims. This type is similar to Nine Mile Polychrome with the difference being that Phoenix Polychrome lacks the band of black on white decoration on the interior of bowls and is instead entirely covered in red slip. As with other types, the exterior of these bowls may have either Gila or Tonto style decoration.

This type dates to AD 1375-1450 and as the name suggests its distribution centers on the Phoenix basin, but distribution extends east to the Cliff Valley and is extends from the Verde Valley in the north to the Douglas, Arizona area in the south (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).

===Dinwiddie Polychrome===
[[Image:Dinwiddie_Bowl.png|thumb|right|Dinwiddie Polychrome Bowl]]
Dinwiddie Polychrome is also defined by bowls with recurved rims and dates to AD 1375-1450. Decoration on this type is restricted to the exterior of vessels with the interior being smudged (Neuzil and Lyons 2005).

Dinwiddie Polychrome has a very restricted spatial distribution and may "not occur west of a line drawn through Kinishba, near Whiteriver, and the Nine Mile site, near [[Bowie, Arizona|Bowie]] [Arizona]" (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30). In Crown’s 1994 study, although she did not name this type, she noted that Roosevelt Red Ware bowls exhibiting smudged interiors were confined to a limited geographical range.

===Los Muertos Polychrome===
Los Muertos Polchrome has a long and storied history of recognition without formal description. Neuzil and Lyons (2005) note that archaeologists have noted this type as a variation of Gila Polychrome since 1927. Names under which this type has been known include Gila Polychrome with four colors, Las Colinas Polychrome, Perry Mesa Polychrome, Gila style with red, and Gila Polychrome; Trichrome Variety.

This type is identified by red paint used in conjunction with black paint in white design fields. Design layout follows either Gila or Tonto styles and so is referred to with reference to either of these varieties. Distribution of this type is limited to the Verde Valley, the Agua Fria-Perry Mesa area, the Lower Salt River Valley, the Middle Gila, the Santa Cruz Flats, and the Tonto Basin (Neuzil and Lyons 2005: 30-31).

===Cliff White-on-red===
Cliff White-on-red is also a recurved bowl form of Roosevelt Red Ware. The interior of the vessel is smudged on the interior and the exteriors exhibit the white-on-red decoration. Cliff White-on-red overlaps in distribution with Dinwiddie Polychrome and thus the range appears to be southwestern New Mexico and southeastern Arizona.

Similar white-on-red types exist in the Southwest, although all show sufficient differences for Cliff White-on-red to hold up as a distinct type. This type is different from Gila White-on-red in that Cliff White-on-red is thinned by scraping rather than paddle-and-anvil, and designs are broader than those found on Gila White-on-red. Unlike Cliff White-on-red, Salado White-on-red is white decoration on a red-slipped obliterated corrugated body. Finally, Tularosa White-on-red is most similar to Cliff White-on-red with a smudged interior and a recurved rim form. The differences are that Tularosa White-on-red has two to four coils around the neck and thinner lines used in the designs. (Neuzil and Lyons 2005)

==Mexican Forms==
[[Image:Escondida Jar.gif|thumb|right|Escondida Polychrome Jar]]
In their exhaustive study of Casas Grandes, DiPeso, Rinaldo and Fenner (1974), the type Escondida Polychrome was formally named. While not officially a Roosevelt Red Ware, this type exhibits hallmark traits of these types. Escondida Polychrome is produced with locally available clay, a buff firing clay used for types such as Ramos Polychrome, and has black and red designs with many motifs being similar to those found on Roosevelt Red Wares. This type does lack the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware, and designs show influence from Chihuahuan types. Escondida Polychrome may be a hybrid type taking aspects of both Roosevelt Red Wares and Chihuahuan wares and being locally produced in northern Mexico.

A second type, unnamed yet, is similar to Escondida Polychrome but exhibits the white slip found on Roosevelt Red Ware. Fenner (personal communication) feels that these vessels are most likely locally produced Roosevelt Red Wares and as such would be found under one of the above headings, although sherds would exhibit the buff-colored paste found in the region.

'''Sawdust carpets''' ({{lang-es|tapetes de aserrín}}) are one or more layers of colored [[sawdust]], and sometimes other additional materials, laid on the ground as decoration. Sawdust carpets are traditionally created to greet a religious procession that walks over them. The tradition of decorating streets in this fashion began in Europe and was brought to the Americas by the Spanish. The tradition is still found in Mexico, [[Central America]], parts of [[South America]] and parts of the United States, but it is strongest in Mexico and Central America.

The most traditional use of these carpets is for processions related to [[Holy Week in Mexico]] and Central America (especially in [[León, Nicaragua|Sutiaba, León, Nicaragua]] and [[Antigua Guatemala]]) and [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] in the United States. In Mexico, their use has been extended to processions dedicated to patron saints, especially in [[Huamantla, Tlaxcala]] and [[Huajuapan de León]], [[Oaxaca]] as well as to [[Day of the Dead]], especially in central Mexico.

==Creation==
[[File:Alfombras de aserrin de Acaxochitlán.JPG|thumb|Carpet in progress in [[Acaxochitlán]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].]]
Traditional carpets in Mexico and Central America are done with colored and uncolored sawdust; however, various other materials are used with it and sometimes in place of it. These include flowers and flower petals, pine needles, rice, fruit, colored earth, ashes and other usually organic materials. The sawdust is cleaned, soaked in water with dye then set out to dry. In the past natural dyes such as [[indigo]], almond shells etc. were used but today most use commercial dyes. The finer and more compact the sawdust the smoother the finished work.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonmunicipio.com/uploads/1/3/8/2/1382165/manual_de_alfombras_pasionarias_de_aserrn_bc.pdf |title=Manual Básico para la Elaboración de Alfombras Pasionarios de Aserrín |last= Quezada |first= Federico |publisher=Municipality of León |location=Nicaragua |language=Spanish |trans-title=Basic manual for the creation of Passion carpets of sawdust |accessdate=November 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most traditional carpets begin with a layer of undyed sawdust spread in a wood frame to smooth out rough surfaces such as stone paved streets and then sprayed with a light coating of water. Sometimes other materials such as sand are used for the base. Then the designs are laid over top.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alusivo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Realizan en Huamantla tapete alusivo al 63 aniversario de la ONU |author= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=October 24, 2008 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Create a carpet alluding to the 63rd anniversary of the UN in Huamantla }}&lt;/ref&gt; On smooth streets and other surfaces, the design can be drawn in chalk and filled in with the coloring materials.&lt;ref name="maubele"&gt;{{cite news |title= Colorful carpets made of sawdust |author=Michael Aubele |newspaper=McClatchy - Tribune Business News|location=Washington, DC |date=June 11, 2007 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ways to create the design, with the use of molds or stencils and freehand, sprinkling and placing the colored material. Freehand takes longer and requires more skill with the use of molds allowing for very defined and complicated designs. After the carpet is finished, it received a very light spray of water to affix the sawdust in place and keep the colors from fading.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

==History==
The tradition has its origins for the feast of Corpus Christi in [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]. There the streets were adorned with flowers and sand, becoming more elaborate over the [[Middle Ages]]. The making of the carpets was then extended to [[Good Friday]] with images related to that day, Christ on the Cross and a grieving Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; The Spanish brought the custom to Latin America and it was established during the colonial period as part of Holy Week celebration, especially to welcome Good Friday and Easter processions of religious icons carried through the streets.&lt;ref name="kmcnaughton"&gt;{{cite journal |last= McNaughton |first= Kathryn |date=June 2005 |title= Sawdust Carpets |journal=Resource Links |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons these were promoted was didactic, with the images telling the story of the [[Passion of Christ]] and other scenes from his life. They were accepted by the indigenous populations especially in Mexico and parts of Guatemala as it was similar to traditions of laying fruit in honor of the gods of the harvest and carpets made from feathers of exotic birds such as [[hummingbird]]s, [[macaw]]s and [[quetzal]]s.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

Today, the making of sawdust carpets is found in Mexico, various Central American countries Honduras, [[Brazil]] and [[Peru]] .&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kmcnaughton"/&gt; The carpets are made in some Catholic parishes especially US Southwest. In [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], the tradition was brought by [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] arriving from Germany.&lt;ref name="maubele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sspx"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sspx.org/district_news/2011_corpus_christi/2011_corpus_christi.htm |title= Celebrating the Feast of Corpus Christi |date=July 6, 2011 |publisher= Society of Saint Pius X |accessdate=November 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to concerns about preserving the tradition, in [[Nicaragua]] in 2000, a technique to create permanent designs in sawdust was created. Exhibitions of these permanent works have been held in Sutiaba, Managua and Antigua Guatemala. These have been created with both religious and secular motifs such as landscapes and [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; In 2011 the Honduran Embassy in the United States held an exhibition of various carpets at an event to commemorate Holy Week.&lt;ref name="presenta"&gt;{{cite news |title= Honduras presenta alfombra de aserrín en EE.UU. |url= http://old.latribuna.hn/2011/04/13/honduras-presenta-alfombra-de-aserrin-en-ee-uu/ |newspaper=La Tribuna |location= Tegucigalpa |date=April 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Honduras presents sawdust carpet in the U.S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally the sawdust afterwards is burned or thrown in rivers which causes environmental problems.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; For this reason some organizations adopt alternatives to sawdust. One example of this is students from Colegio Cedros Norte in [[Mexico City]], who make the carpets for Corpus Christi using grass mats and flower petals, which is more biodegradable.&lt;ref name="ecologia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Conjugan fe y ecología |author=Irma Valadez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 8, 2012 |page=4 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Conjoin faith and ecology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significant traditions using the craft==

[[File:AntiguaEasterCarpetMacaws.jpg|thumb|Part of a carpet made for Holy Week in Antigua Guatemala]]
The largest event which features sawdust carpets in Mexico is in [[Huamantla, Tlaxcala]]. The carpets are part of the Feria de Huamantla which extend over the month of August. All month the artisans create carpets in the atrium of the Basilica, the sanctuary of the city’s most important image the Nuestra Señora de la Caridad (Our Lady of Charity). Each of these are about forty m2 and change each day, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary image.&lt;ref name="vochoa"&gt;{{cite news |title= Huamantla: Las alfombras florales |author=Vicente Ochoa |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=August 8, 1999 |page=18 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Huamantla: The flowered carpets }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the most important events occurs from 14 to 15 August. Since 1941, Nuestra Señora de la Caridad leaves its sanctuary in a procession that wanders for eight km around the streets of the city. The entire procession route is covered in carpets made of sawdust and other materials.&lt;ref name="lafe"&gt;{{cite news |title= La fe de un pueblo, es la noche que nadie duerme |author=Lucia Perez  |url= http://puebla.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/65b3d51e743bb2923f9d2cc8920f86ba |newspaper= Milenio Puebla |location=Puebla |date=August 16, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The faith of a people, it's the night no one sleeps }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets are created the night before during what is called “La noche que nadie duerme” (The night no one sleeps) then trampled by the procession of the image in the early morning hours of the 15th.&lt;ref name="vochoa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lafe"/&gt; The carpets are organized and made by committees organized by the various neighborhoods. The procession and the carpets draw about 300,000 visitors each year.&lt;ref name="lafe"/&gt;

The making of these sawdust carpets have led to the town and some of its artisans being more widely known. One noted creator from Huamantla is Efrén Chacón, who not only participates in Huamantla each year, but has also traveled all over Mexico and to countries such as Spain, Italy, Canada and Japan to give exhibitions and talks.&lt;ref name="lafe"/&gt; His work with the carpets earned Efren Chacon a chance to meet [[Pope John Paul II]] when he and 222 other artisans worked to create a carpet with the image of the Pope with the Virgin Mary using sawdust and flowers. He has received recognition for his work from Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Italy, El Salvador, Guatemala and the United States.&lt;ref name="loinspiran"&gt;{{cite news |title= Artesanos de la Fe / Fabricantes de alfombras: Tradicion y fe lo inspiran |author=Juan Ramon Nava Flores |newspaper=Palabra |location=Saltillo, Mexico |date=January 16, 1999 |page=7 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Artisans of Faith/Creators of carpets: Tradition and faith inspire them }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, artisans in Huamantla also created a carpet 150 meters long and six meters wide with a design to honor the United Nations for its 63rd anniversary.&lt;ref name="alusivo"/&gt;

The tradition of making these carpets for patron saint processions has spread to other areas of Mexico. They are now made in the [[Tlaxcala, Tlaxcala|city of Tlaxcala]] for the procession of the Virgin Mary image of Octolán,&lt;ref name="milagro"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/un-milagro-un-recorrido-de-aserrin-y-flores-en-tlaxcala.html |title= Un milagro, un recorrido de aserrín y flores en Tlaxcala |author= Mayte G. Bonilla |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=A miracle, a path of sawdust and flowers in Tlaxcala |accessdate=November 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the feast of the Apostle Peter on 29 June in San Pedro Xalostoc, near [[Ecatepec de Morelos|Ecatepec]], [[State of Mexico]] .&lt;ref name="xalostoc"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tapetes de San Pedro Xalostoc, tradición que llegó para quedarse  |author=Emmanuel Suberza |url= http://www.hoyestado.com/nota.php?id=3949 |newspaper= Hoy en el Estado |location=Toluca |date=July 2, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Carpets in San Pedro Xalostoc, tradition that came to stay }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huajuapan de León]] creates carpets for the procession of the Señor de los Corazones, a black Christ figure, on 24 July which extend over five kilometers on the city’s streets. Although the tradition was adopted from that of Huamantla, Huajuapan since has developed its own characteristics such as the designs on the carpet. These include [[Mixtec people|Mixtec]] [[fretwork]], images from pre Hispanic codices and regional color schemes. The event draws over 10,000 visitors along the procession route.&lt;ref name="cariño"&gt;{{cite news |title= Tapetes de Aserrín, muestra de cariño al Señor de los Corazones |url= http://www.xeouradio.com/2012/07/19/tapetes-de-aserrn-muestra-de-cario-al-seor-de-los-corazones/ |newspaper=XEOU Radio |location=Oaxaca |date=July 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Sawdust carpets, exhibition of love for the Señor de los Corazones }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of making carpets with sawdust and other materials has since been extended to include [[Day of the Dead]] in Mexico, especially for large institutional altars called ofrendas and ofrendas to honor important people such as a one for writer [[Carlos Fuentes]] who died in 2012.&lt;ref name="cancuntap"&gt;{{cite news |title= Elaboran tapetes de aserrín para conmemorar el Día de Muertos en Cancún |author=Elvira Espinosa |url= http://www.lapoliciaca.com/nota-roja/elaboran-tapetes-de-aserrin-para-conmemorar-el-dia-de-muertos-en-cancun/ |newspaper=La Policiaca |location=Cancun |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Create sawdust carpets to commemorate Day of the Dead in Cancun }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dosgrandes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Rinden tributo a dos grandes |author=Imelda Robles |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=October 26, 2012 |page=17 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pay tribute to two greats}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day of the Dead carpets can accompany a traditional ofrenda on a table or can be the entire ofrenda.&lt;ref name="dosgrandes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="macro"&gt;{{cite news |title= Montan macro altar en memoria de víctimas de casino Royale en NL |author= |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=October 26, 2011 |page= |language=Spanish |trans-title=Set up mega altar in memory of the victims of the Casino Royale in Nuevo León }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most commonly made in the central part of Mexico. In [[Azcapotzalco]] in Mexico City, large carpets are made with sawdust along with marigold petals, corn, salt and candles for Day of the Dead. These include many made by primary school children.&lt;ref name="admirar"&gt;{{cite news |title= Aserrín, flores y maíz de colores para admirar |author=Berenice Balboa |url= http://www.eluniversaldf.mx/home/nota37133.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Sawdust, flowers and corn in various colors to admire }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 carpets dedicated to Day of the Dead are made in Guanajuato,&lt;ref name="lamuerte"&gt;{{cite news |title= Reciben a la muerte con tapetes de aserrín  |author=  |url= http://WWW.MILENIO.COM/CDB/DOC/IMPRESO/8858693 |newspaper= Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=November 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Receive death with sawdust carpets }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the festival [https://www.facebook.com/ELTAPETEDELAMUERTE "El Tapete de la Muerte"].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/ELTAPETEDELAMUERTE&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the tradition has spread as far south as [[Teotitlán de Flores Magón]], Oaxaca where they are made to honor the saints and [[Cancún]] as part of their Day of the Dead festivities.&lt;ref name="cancuntap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="teotitlan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Realizan exposición de Tapetes de Aserrín en Teotitlán |author= Acela Guadalupe  |url= http://www.vozdelsur.com.mx/oaxaca/33260.html  |newspaper= La Voz del Sur |location= Oaxaca |date=November 4, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Realize exhibition of sawdust carpets in Teotitlán }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been created as far north as [[Monterrey]], where one large carpet/ofrenda surrounded by 300 candles was made to commemorate the victims of a [[2011 Monterrey casino attack|massacre at the city’s Casino Royale]] .&lt;ref name="macro"/&gt;

In Central America, two noted events that feature the carpets is the community of Sutiaba in the municipality of [[León, Nicaragua]] and in [[Antigua Guatemala]], both of which maintain the original purpose of use during Holy Week. Sutiaba is an indigenous community whose tradition dates back at least to 19th century according to written record.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; The carpets are made on what is called the Calle de Las Alfombras (Street of the Carpets) in the indigenous community of Sutiaba, meters from the San Juan de Dios de Sutiaba church. The carpets are created between Monday and Friday during Holy Week for the Good Friday procession. Each section takes about five to six hours with two to six people working on it depending on the complexity.&lt;ref name="exponen"&gt;{{cite news |title= Exponen tradicionales alfombras pasionarias de aserrín en Sutiaba |author= Jose Luis González  |url= http://www.elnuevodiario.com.ni/nacionales/247287-exponen-tradicionales-alfombras-pasionarias-de-aserrin-sutiaba  |newspaper= El Nuevo Diario |location= León, Nicaragua |date=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Exhibit traditional Passion carpets of sawdust in Sutiaba }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicaraguan artist Federico Quezada has worked to preserve the sawdust carpet traditions of Sutiaba.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

Another area famous for its carpets is Antigua Guatemala as it has mixed Catholic and indigenous images since the colonial period.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt; Antigua Guatemala carpets are generally made using molds with allegoric designs, religious symbols, Biblical scenes, geometric shapes and floral designs with entire families working together using sawdust, pine needles, fruit, flowers, sand and cut paper.&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mantiene"&gt;{{cite news |title= Antigua mantiene tradicion religiosa |author=Oscar Rene Oliva |newspaper=El Sentinel |location=Fort Lauderdale, FL |date=April 10, 2004 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Antigua maintains religious tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carpets and processions in Antigua, Guatemala draw about 200,000 tourists from the country and abroad.&lt;ref name="mantiene"/&gt;

In [[Catalonia]], a similar tradition is called the Festa de les Enramades d'Arbúcies (Feast of the Bowers) related to Corpus Christi, which was declared a national heritage in 1999.  The tradition has been traced as far back as 1589. The Feast of the Bowers is eight days of festivities along with preparation days before when people collect large quantities of flowers and other materials to make carpets for the streets alone with tree branches. The color is mostly provided by the flowers. The elaborate decorations are then walked over by a parade of floats and other festive elements.&lt;ref name="festa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patrimonifestiu.cultura.gencat.cat/Cicles-festius/Corpus/Festa-de-les-Enramades-d-Arbucies |title=http://patrimonifestiu.cultura.gencat.cat/Cicles-festius/Corpus/Festa-de-les-Enramades-d-Arbucies |publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya |accessdate=November 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5282">'''Sheilas' Wheels''' is a [[car insurance]] brand based in the United Kingdom that targets its insurance to women. The brand was launched in October 2005 by [[Peter Wood (businessman)|Peter Wood]], and is part of [[Esure]], the insurance group he founded with [[HBOS]] in 1999. The brand has achieved fame through its advertising featuring three Sheilas clad in pink sequinned dresses who sing a variety of jingles promoting Sheilas’ Wheels (e.g. “For bonzer car insurance deals, girls get onto Sheilas’ Wheels”), often from the seats of a bubblegum pink convertible – sometimes referred to as “The Sheilamobile”.

==The Sheilas==
{{main article|The Sheilas}}
Sheilas’ Wheels and the three Sheilas themselves have been the subject of much media attention, and have regularly featured in polls of irritating but effective advertising. In one of the early adverts set in an Australian outback bar, [[Joe Scully]] (Shane Connor) of ''[[Neighbours]]'' can be seen.

[[The Sheilas]] themselves are all accomplished singers and performers who began performing as The Sheilas during 2006 at gigs in the United Kingdom – often at [[gay bar|gay club]]s and student venues – they are Cathi Ogden, Carly Romain and Emma Robbins. Ogden is the only true Australian of the three; Robbins is sister to [[Ted Robbins]], [[Amy Robbins]] and [[Kate Robbins]], and is married to Simon Shelton who plays Tinky Winky in the ''[[Teletubbies]]'', and is a second cousin of [[Paul McCartney]].

In the television adverts, the girls usually appear with Romain on the left, Ogden centre and Robbins on the right (with dark hair).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilovesheilas.com/ILS/TheSheilas/index.htm Official Sheilas' Wheels website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103113845/http://www.ilovesheilas.com/ILS/TheSheilas/index.htm |date=2009-01-03 }} ilovesheilas.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sheilas' Wheels Adverts==
Since their launch, the Sheilas’ Wheels adverts have grown over one hundred video tributes, parodies and imitations on [[YouTube]], including a song by the [[Amateur Transplants]].

The Sheilas’ Wheels car in the advert is a ‘shell’ and not a working car. It was created by heavily adapting the body of an old American car. There is a second working car, which is similar to the one in the advert that is used for promotional purposes. It is a 1957 Ford [[Mercury Monterey]] convertible that the company bought in 2007 on [[eBay]] and restored. The car lives in a warehouse of a specialist company in [[Surrey]], who rent out and sometimes sell American vehicles. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The music for the Sheilas’ Wheels adverts was composed by John Altman, arranged by [[Jeff Wayne]] Music and sung by Cathi Ogden, Carly Romain and Emma Robbins.

==The Sheilas single==
In October 2007, The Sheilas released a single, (I’m So) Happy Happy (You’re Mine), produced by [[Stock, Aitken and Waterman]] with Ogden doing the lead vocal on this recording. Unfortunately, the single only peaked at number 91, this despite having an accompanied video for the song.

==History==
The brand was originally conceived by copywriter Chris Wilkins and his creative partner and wife, Sian Vickers. The two had previously worked with Peter Wood during the 1990s. Wilkins was the copywriter of the famous advert by [[Cadbury plc|Cadbury's]], [[Smash Martians]], which is often cited among the most memorable adverts of all time.

The Sheilas' Wheels car insurance product&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lancasterinsurance.co.uk/insurance/classic-car-insurance/ |title=Car Insurance products |accessdate=2007-08-24 |date= |publisher=Foyer }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a number of female focused benefits that differentiated it from competitors, such as enhanced cover for handbags in cars, female friendly repairers and a free counselling service with its comprehensive cover.

In February 2007, Sheilas' Wheels ran a competition for members of the public to appear in their television adverts, ''Make Me a Sheila Star'', which attracted over 11,000 applicants including babies, boys, girls, men and women, with the youngest being 18 months, and the oldest 98. In the end, thirty members of the public appeared in two adverts: one featuring a twelve person pyramid of women on the back of the Sheilamobile, and one featuring them in a stretched version.

In January 2008, Sheilas' Wheels began sponsoring the [[ITV National Weather]], with a series of clips showing the Sheilas in a variety of weather conditions. Prior to sponsorship by Sheilas' Wheels, the ITV National Weather had been sponsored by [[E.ON UK|E.ON]] (formerly [[Powergen]]) for eighteen years – the longest running sponsorship deal in television history in the United Kingdom (as well as the first).

In March 2011, a European Court of Justice ruling stated that price discrimination based on gender breaches EU rules on equality. A spokesman from Sheilas' Wheels parent company Esure stated that "premiums will rise drastically for young female drivers."{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Sichuan Fine Arts Institute''' ('''SFAI''') ({{zh|s=四川美术学院 |t=四川美術學院 |p=Sìchuān měishù xuéyuàn}}) is a [[public university|public]] [[fine art]]s university in [[Chongqing]], China.

Sichuan Fine Arts Institute, with a history of over 64 years, is one of the four most prominent art academies in China and the only one in the southwest China.

==History and reputation==
Sichuan Fine Arts Institute has a very bright history in the creation of art and deep research. High quality artwork has been created by the teachers in SFAI.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the institute was symbolized by handcraft arts. In the 1970s, it was sculpture, especially the most famous group statues, the “Rent Collecting Courtyard”. In the 1980s it was oil painting, such as SFAI's president Luo Zhongli’s masterpiece "My Father”, etc.

The institute enjoys great prestige domestically and internationally. The excellent artwork has become milestones in contemporary Chinese art. Since the 1990s, many teachers and students have gained nationwide and international awards. They got opportunities to make their work exhibited to the world.

At present, it’s been establishing cultural exchange relations with more and more foreign art institutes, delegations and artists, dispatching students to study abroad and receiving foreign students to study at SFAI, which result in promoting international art exchanges and development. These outstanding artists make huge contribution to the development of fine arts in China.

The traditional campus was in the district of [[Jiulongpo District|Jiulongpo]], in Chongqing. The new campus was built in Huxi District, Chongqing in 2005.

The university's philosophy is "close to life, to serve the people; knowledge as equally important, new incentives; open-minded and keeping up with the times". The overall development objective is to provide the highest level of art education in the western region of China.

==Departments==
Programs of study at SFAI include craft art, oil painting, sculpture, design, architecture, print making, art theory, and traditional Chinese painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academics|url=http://www.scfai.edu.cn/english/Channel.aspx?Id=3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517014309/http://www.scfai.edu.cn/English/Channel.aspx?Id=3|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 May 2007|publisher=Sichuan Fine Arts Institute|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The institute no longer offers Chinese language classes for international and exchange students as a second language at the Huxi campus.)

'''Susan Felicity Austin''' (born 7 September 1965) is a British disabled artist working in multimedia, performance and installation.&lt;ref name="Sue Austin about"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Sue Austin |url=http://www.wearefreewheeling.org.uk/sue-austin-about |website=We Are Freewheeling |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin is best known for her work "Creating the Spectacle!" in which she uses a specially modified wheelchair to move underwater, using scuba diving equipment; it was performed as part of the London [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]].&lt;ref name="bbc technology-19389396"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kleinman |first=Zoe |title=Underwater wheelchair put to test ahead of Paralympics |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19389396 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin's underwater wheelchair has been seen by more than 150 million people worldwide.&lt;ref name="a-n News"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharratt |first=Chris |title=Digital R&amp;D Fund #5: An underwater wheelchair with ambitions to fly |url=https://www.a-n.co.uk/news/digital-rd-fund-5-an-underwater-wheelchair-with-ambitions-to-fly |website=a-n News |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin lives in [[Devon]], south west England.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Austin studied BSc Hons. Psychology at the [[University College of Swansea]], [[University of Wales]], completing her degree in 1987.&lt;ref name="More about Sue"&gt;{{cite web |title=More about Sue |url=http://www.wearefreewheeling.org.uk/sue-austin-more-sue |website=We Are Freewheeling |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later studied for a BA in Fine Art at the [[University of Plymouth]], before going on to complete a Fine Art MA from the same institution in 2014.&lt;ref name="More about Sue" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holton Lee Uni"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austin |first=Sue |title=Reflections on an Open Exhibition |journal=Holton Lee News |date=Spring 2008 |issue=26 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, she began using a wheelchair after an extended illness limited her mobility.&lt;ref name="Guardian interview"&gt;{{cite web |last=Austin |first=Sue |title=Wheelchair ballet underwater: it's more like flying than diving |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/21/underwater-wheelchair-flying-diving |website=The Guardian |accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She trained as a disabled diver in 2005, and has certifications from the [[Professional Association of Diving Instructors]].&lt;ref name="More about Sue" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian interview" /&gt;

==Artistic career==

Austin has said her artistic practice considers "the effects of a [[medical model of disability|'medical' model of disability]] when compared with writings on the [[Social model of disability|Social Model]]".&lt;ref name="Holton Lee Uni" /&gt; The photographer Norman Lomax, who captured images of Austin in [[Sharm el-Sheikh]] in the Red Sea, told ''[[The Independent]]'': "As a photographer, the best stories are of ordinary people doing extraordinary things – that's what I saw here."&lt;ref name="Independent Norman Lomax"&gt;{{cite web |last=Jacques |first=Adam |title=Portfolio: Norman Lomax|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/portfolio-norman-lomax-7956791.html?origin=internalSearch |website=The Independent|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "It looked like an extraordinary underwater ballet. It also broke down a deeply engrained perception that I had of disability that I think a lot of us share."&lt;ref name="Independent Norman Lomax" /&gt; [[Channel 4 News]]' Culture Editor, Matthew Cain said of Austin's "Creating the Spectacle!": "Despite its title, this piece of work isn't just about creating a spectacle, it's also about changing perceptions and challenging us to think of the NHS wheelchair not as a symbol of limitation but as a tool for release and freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ki_IRBb0qU|title = C4 News: Wheelchair artist underwater|last = |first = |date = August 2012|work = |access-date = |via = Youtube|publisher = Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Austin told the [[BBC]]'s [[South Today]]: "I started wanting to make work around my wheelchair, but what I found was that everyone always interpreted it as if I was trying to say something negative about limitation fear. But for me it’s always been about freedom, it's transformed my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWvbXNnxaeo|title = South Today interview Sue Austin|last = BBC South Today|first = |date = April 2013|work = News report|access-date = |via = Youtube|publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin has a patent covering her underwater wheelchair which was granted on 21 August 2013.&lt;ref name="IPO"&gt;{{cite web|title=GB2494309 – Wheelchair system|url=https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2494309|website=Intellectual Property Office|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Talks and presentations===
Austin has delivered a number of high-profile public presentations about her work. In December 2012 Austin was filmed for [[TED (conference)|TED]]'s TEDxWomen conference delivering a talk entitled 'Deep sea diving ... in a wheelchair', which as of March 2016 has had more than 1.8 million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/sue_austin_deep_sea_diving_in_a_wheelchair|title=Deep sea diving ... in a wheelchair|last=Austin|first=Sue|website=www.ted.com|access-date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013 she was invited to speak at [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B.

== List of major works ==
* "360 Degrees – A New Angle on Access" (2015-ongoing). This project uses 360 degree technology to create digital artworks.
*  "Flying Free" (ongoing). A digital artwork co-commissioned by Unlimited and The Space which features footage of Austin and her wheelchair taking to the skies in a Flexwing Microlite vehicle.
*  "Creating the Spectacle!" (2012). A series of live art and filmed performances of Austin's underwater wheelchair commissioned by Unlimited for the [[2012 Cultural Olympiad]].
*  "Freewheeling, Present and Absent"  (2009). A trail painted throughout the [[Plymouth]] city centre by Austin using her wheelchair. Austin said of the work "By exploring the subjective narratives created by my use of the wheelchair and the traces it leaves, I hope to reconfigure the preconceptions of the viewer and lead to a revaluing of the wheelchair".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wearefreewheeling.org.uk/sue-austin-projects|title=Projects|last=|first=|date=|website=We Are Freewheeling|publisher=Freewheeling|access-date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ambidextrous Universe''''' is a [[popular science]] book by [[Martin Gardner]], covering aspects of [[symmetry]] and [[asymmetry]] in human culture, science and the wider [[universe]].

Originally published in 1964, it underwent revisions in 1969, 1979, 1990 and 2005 (the last two are known as the "Third, revised edition"). Originally titled '' The Ambidextrous Universe: Mirror Asymmetry and Time-Reversed Worlds'', subsequent editions are known as ''The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings''.

==Content==
The book begins with the subject of [[mirror reflection]], and from there passes through symmetry in [[geometry]], [[poetry]], [[art]], [[music]], [[galaxy|galaxies]], [[sun]]s, [[planet]]s and [[living organisms]]. It then moves down into the [[molecule|molecular scale]] and looks at how symmetry and asymmetry have evolved from the beginning of life on [[Earth]]. There is a chapter on [[carbon]] and its versatility and on [[chirality]] in [[biochemistry]]. Chapter 18 (and subsequent chapters) deals with a conundrum called the Ozma Problem (see below). The second half of the book concerns various aspects of [[Atomic physics|atomic]] and [[subatomic]] physics and how they relate to mirror asymmetry and the related concepts of chirality, [[antimatter]], [[magnetic polarity|magnetic]] and [[electrical polarity]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[Charge (physics)|charge]] and [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. [[Time invariance]] (and [[T-symmetry|reversal]]) is discussed. Implications for [[particle physics]], [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] are covered and brought up to date (in later editions of the book) with regard to [[Grand Unified Theory|GUT]]s, [[Theory of everything|TOE]]s, [[superstring theory]] and [[M-theory]].

===The Ozma Problem===
The 18th chapter, "The Ozma Problem", poses a problem that Gardner claims would arise if Earth should ever enter into communication with life on another planet through [[Project Ozma]]. This is the problem of how to communicate the meaning of left and right, where the two communicants are conditionally not allowed to view any one object in common. The problem was first implied in [[Immanuel Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] discussion of left and right, and [[William James]] mentioned it in his chapter on "The Perception of Space" in ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890). It is also mentioned by [[Charles Howard Hinton]]. Gardner follows the thread of several false leads on the road to the solution of the Ozma Problem, in each case presenting an apparent solution which, on closer examination, turns out to be a false one.

The solution to the Ozma Problem was finally embodied in the famous "[[Wu experiment]]", conducted in 1956 by Chinese-American physicist [[Chien-Shiung Wu]] (1912–1997), involving the [[beta decay]] of [[cobalt-60]]. This experiment was the first to disprove the conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]. At long last, according to Gardner, it is believed that one could carefully describe the Wu experiment to a distant extraterrestrial intelligence and thereby convey the exact meaning of left/right.

==Literary references==
===W.H. Auden===
[[W. H. Auden]] alludes to ''The Ambidextrous Universe'' in his poem "Josef Weinheber" (1965).

===Vladimir Nabokov===
'''''Pale Fire'''''&lt;br&gt;
In the original 1964 edition of ''The Ambidextrous Universe'', Gardner quoted two lines of poetry from [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s 1962 novel ''[[Pale Fire]]'' which are supposed to have been written by a poet, "[[John Shade]]", who is actually fictional. As a joke, Gardner credited the lines only to Shade and put Shade's name in the index as if he were a real person. In his 1969 novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle]]'', Nabokov returned the favor by having the character Van Veen "quote" the Gardner book along with the two lines of verse:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Space is a swarming in the eyes, and Time a singing in the ears," says John Shade, a modern poet, as quoted by an invented philosopher ("Martin Gardiner" {{sic}}) in ''The Ambidextrous Universe'', page 165 {{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;Nabokov, Vladimir (1969), ''Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle'', [[McGraw-Hill|McGraw-Hill Book Company]], pg 577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Look at the Harlequins!'''''&lt;br&gt;
Nabokov's 1974 novel ''[[Look at the Harlequins!]]'', about a man who can't distinguish left from right, was heavily influenced by his reading of ''The Ambidextrous Universe''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. Barton (1984), "The Ambidextrous Universe of Nabakov's ''Look at the Harlequins!''"; In: Roth, Phyllis (ed.), ''Critical Essays on Vladimir Nabokov''; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayles, N. Katherine (1984), "Ambivalence: Symmetry, Asymmetry, and the Physics of Time Reversal in Nabokov's ''Ada''", in the same author's ''The Cosmic Web: Scientific Field Models and Literary Strategies in the Twentieth Century'', [[Cornell University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5798">'''Theater Breaking Through Barriers (TBTB)''', formerly '''[http://tbtb.org/ Theater By the Blind]''', is an [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive]] [[theater company]] in [[New York City]] that strives develop the talents of individuals with disabilities for work onstage, backstage, in the office and in the audience.&lt;ref name="TBTB-intro"/&gt;  It was founded in 1979 by Ike Schambelan(who died of cancer in 2015), with sighted actors recording plays for the blind.  The theater then moved to performances for the blind and then blind performances for the sighted.&lt;ref name="New York Day by Day: Explaining Blindness"/&gt; They recently began doing a short play festival each year.

==Crystal Clear==
''Crystal Clear'' by [[Phil Young (playwright)|Phil Young]] opened in 1986 at the [[Long Wharf Theater]]'s Stage II.  The show starred (George Ashiotis) who played a young actor who is gradually going blind from diabetes and his girlfriend who has been blind from birth (Lucia Puccia) .  ''Crystal Clear'' began as an improvisation on a [[London]] pub stage in 1982.

The production had mixed reviews from critics. Mel Gusso said for The New York Times, "It is diagnostic rather than psychologically probing."&lt;ref name="crystal"/&gt;  Another critic said the play was "a wildly unfocused work that tries to cover too vast a terrain" and that it contained "a cornucopia of cliches".&lt;ref name="sentimental"/&gt;

==A Midsummer Night's Dream==
''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] staged at the Barrow Group Theater in [[Manhattan]], was the first play by TBTB to feature a character in a wheelchair:
{{Quote|text=It holds Ann Marie Morelli, an actress playing Hermia, who at first has the attention of one too many men but later finds herself with the attention of one too few. Hermia, as created by Shakespeare, is short, and her rival in love, Helena (Erin O’Leary), is tall. Through the centuries poor Hermia has always taken a verbal beating for her physique, but here it has a different bite.

"Get you gone, you dwarf, you minimus," barks Lysander, who once doted on her. And Hermia herself laments, "My legs can keep no pace with my desires."
 |sign=Neil Genzlinger&lt;ref name="Actors Who See With More Than Their Eyes"/&gt; |source=New York Times
}}
A note in the theater program said, "Increasingly we feel we must include all disabled people [rather than blind people only] in our work."&lt;ref name="Actors Who See With More Than Their Eyes"/&gt; To reflect this shift in thought and philosophy, 2008 saw the company changing its name from Theater By The Blind to Theater Breaking Through Barriers.&lt;ref name="Theater by the Blind Changes Name"/&gt; Productions, such as Romeo &amp; Juliet, closely followed featuring an actor, Gregg Mozgala,  with Cerebral Palsy, their first in a subsequent line of productions incorporating actors with various disabilities.

'''Theatre Rice''' is an ASUC sponsored theater group that conducts dedicated shows on the [[University of California, Berkeley]] campus regularly, performs externally throughout the [[San Francisco Bay area]], and tours throughout [[California]]. Shows traditionally include [[improvisation]], [[sketch comedy]], [[drama]], [[film]]s, live [[music]], [[adaptations]], [[musicals]], [[dances]], and [[Duo Interpretation|duologues]]. Other forms of performance have been featured as well.

==History==
Theatre Rice, the first modern [[Asian American theatre]] group at Berkeley, was started in the autumn of 1998. Since its conception, Theatre Rice has grown considerably, both artistically and physically. In the past several years, the group has begun to attract an increasingly larger audience and a greater membership. Theatre Rice has emerged from a relatively unknown group to a group whose performances have become an anticipated community event.

==Mission==
Theatre Rice was conceived to provide people (particularly, but not exclusively, Asian Americans) who might not otherwise have a chance to participate in theatrical arts the opportunity to [[acting|act]], [[writing|write]], [[singing|sing]], [[theatre director|direct]], [[dance]], and learn [[Theatre|behind-the-stage]] techniques. What sets Theatre Rice apart from other dramatic groups is its open and unintimidating environment, and the basic ethic that effort and commitment are more important than experience or innate talent. Because the group contains both seasoned and fledgling actors, there exists a healthy dynamic within which members can share their experiences and learn from each other.

The Asian American aspect of Theatre Rice is important because it is a step towards combating the misrepresentation, as well as the lack of representation, of the Asian American community in popular culture. By its mere existence, Theatre Rice is fulfilling its purpose of putting forth ideas that stem from the minds of Asian Americans, and therefore addressing the Asian American population as well as the greater community within Berkeley and beyond.

==Charity work==
A percentage of every show's profits goes to a charity or nonprofit organization, selected out of a pool of organizations usually submitted by the cast and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tr.berkeley.edu/charity&amp;menu=about_menu Theatre Rice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations have traditionally been associated with Asian American and performing arts communities, such as the [[Asian American Theater Company]], the API Youth Promoting Advocacy and Leadership, Youth For Asian Theatre, and the National Asian Women's Health Organization. More recent donations include [[Theatre Rhinoceros]], the Japanese Red Cross in the aftermath of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], [[Direct Relief International]] to help [[Hurricane Sandy]] survivors, and [[St. Baldrick's Foundation]].

==Awards and recognitions==
Theatre Rice was voted Best On-Campus Acting Group by the [[Daily Cal]]'s Best of Berkeley 2009 and Best Performance Group in the Best of Berkeley 2011.

{{nihongo|'''Tomonobu Imamichi'''|今道 友信|Imamichi Tomonobu}} (November 19, 1922 – October 13, 2012) was a [[Japanese philosopher]] who studied [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Mainichi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/select/news/20121017k0000m060019000c.html|script-title=ja:訃報:今道友信さん８９歳＝東大名誉教授エコエティカ提唱|date=16 October 2012|publisher=''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''|language=Japanese|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112022432/http://mainichi.jp/select/news/20121017k0000m060019000c.html|archivedate=12 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Life==
Imamichi taught in Europe (Paris and Germany) as well as in Japan (he was also emeritus professor of the [[University of Palermo]]). Beginning in 1979 he was the president of the ''[[Centre International pour l'Étude Comparée de Philosophie et d'Esthétique]]'' and after 1997 of the [[International Institute of Philosophy]]. In 1976 he founded the journal ''Aesthetics''.

He translated [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' into Japanese (in 1972) and has written numerous books in Japanese. Imamichi was a supporter of [[transculturation|communication between cultures]]. He characterizes [[Western philosophy]] as an attempt to achieve a God's eye view (''das in-dem-Gott-sein''; to be in the being of God) and [[Eastern philosophy]] as an attempt to be in the world (''das in-der-Welt-sein''). Imamichi sees in both stances two incomplete and complementary [[humanism]]s, and observes that since the publication of ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', some Western philosophers have adopted a more Eastern stance while other Eastern philosophers have attempted to reach the Absolute or the Eternal.

Tomonobu Imamichi was the father of guitarist and songwriter [[Tomotaka Imamichi]], pianist Nobuko Kawaguchi, biologist Yukiko Imamichi and psychologist Tomoaki Imamichi.

'''Uberfic''' (short for '''uber fanfic''', '''uberXena''') or simply '''uber''', '''über''', or '''ueber''' (from {{lang-de|über-}}, for 'over-' or 'supra-') is a genre of [[Alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]] [[fan fiction]] in which characters or events are portrayed somewhat closely to original [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] but usually in a different time period, place, or reality, many times featuring the [[ancestors]], [[Kinship|descendants]], or [[reincarnation]]s of canon characters, known as uber-characters. The uber-characters' names are never{{Cn|date=August 2015}} [[canon (fiction)|canon]].  The term originated in ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' fandom, coined in 1997 by Kym Taborn, the webmaster of the fansite Whoosh.org.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.whoosh.org Whoosh.org - The International Association of Xena Studies (IAXS)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of story was used by the series itself, beginning with the second season episode "[[The Xena Scrolls]]".&lt;ref name="lunacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena |title=Definitions |accessdate=2007-02-04 |author=Lunacy |date=2006-02-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127090906/http://www.lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common trend in Xena fanfics was to write Uber stories in which the characters' analogues discover that they are soulmates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genders.org/g34/g34_hamming.html Whatever Turns You On: Becoming-Lesbian and the Production of Desire in the Xenaverse]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[film]] and [[television]] production, a '''visual effects supervisor''' is responsible for achieving the creative aims of the director or producers through the use of [[visual effects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles/4265_vfx_supervisor Creativeskillset.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is a creative role, most supervisors possess a strong technical background and are capable of making informed decisions about the most efficient and effective technique to employ to solve the problem at hand.  Often a supervisor will work in tandem with a visual effects producer and [[CG Supervisor|computer graphics supervisor]].

Supervisors can be employed directly by a film production company or work for a visual effects company.  Often there are several VFX supervisors on a project, although there is typically a senior VFX supervisor directing their efforts.

Specific responsibilities vary somewhat depending on the nature of the production, however most supervisors:
* Handle a VFX project from conception through to completion
* Manage and direct the technical, artistic, and production personnel
* Possess a knowledge of various visual effects techniques with emphasis on camera set-ups and film knowledge with an eye for composition and camera work. 
* Accurately predict timing and associated costs of project 
* Collaborate on the bidding and negotiation processes 

The Visual Effects Society is a prominent trade organization representing the interests of visual effects professionals.
