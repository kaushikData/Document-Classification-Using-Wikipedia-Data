'''''13 Reasons Why''''' (stylized onscreen as '''''TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY''''') is an American [[teen drama]] [[web television]] series developed for [[Netflix]] by [[Brian Yorkey]], based on the 2007 novel ''[[Thirteen Reasons Why]]'' by [[Jay Asher]]. The series revolves around seventeen-year-old high school student, [[Clay Jensen]], and his deceased friend [[Hannah Baker]], who has killed herself after having to face a culture of gossip and sexual assault at her high school and a lack of support from her friends and her school. A box of [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] recorded by Hannah in the lead up to her suicide detail thirteen reasons why she ended her life. The series is produced by July Moon Productions, Kicked to the Curb Productions, [[Anonymous Content]] and [[Paramount Television]], with Yorkey and [[Diana Son]] serving as [[showrunners]].

[[Dylan Minnette]] stars as Clay, while [[Katherine Langford]] plays Hannah. [[Christian Navarro]], [[Alisha Boe]], [[Brandon Flynn]], [[Justin Prentice]], [[Miles Heizer]], [[Ross Butler (actor)|Ross Butler]], [[Devin Druid]], [[Amy Hargreaves]], [[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]], [[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]], and [[Brian d'Arcy James]] also star. A film from [[Universal Pictures]] based on ''Thirteen Reasons Why'' began development in February 2011, with [[Selena Gomez]] set to star as Hannah, before being shelved in favor of a television series and Netflix ordering the show straight to series in October 2015, with Gomez instead serving as an executive producer.

The first season was released on Netflix on March 31, 2017. It received positive reviews from critics and audiences, who praised its subject matter and acting, particularly the performances of Minnette and Langford. For her performance, Langford received a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama|Best Actress in a Drama Series]]. However, its graphic depiction of issues such as suicide and rape, along with other mature content prompted concerns from mental health professionals. In response, Netflix added a warning card and from March 2018, a video that plays at the start of each season warning viewers about its themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/arts/television/netflix-warning-video-13-reasons-why.html |title=Netflix Adds a Warning Video to '13 Reasons Why' |last=Libbey |first=Peter |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 22, 2018 |accessdate=June 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Netflix renewed ''13 Reasons Why'' for a second season; filming began the next month and concluded that December. The second season was released on May 18, 2018, and received negative reviews from critics and mixed reviews from audiences. A third season was ordered in June 2018 and is set to be released in 2019. Critical and audience reaction to the series has been divided, with the program generating controversy between audiences and industry reviewers.

==Premise==
In season one, seventeen year old [[Clay Jensen]] returns home from school one day to find a mysterious box on his porch. Inside he discovers seven [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes recorded by [[Hannah Baker]], his deceased classmate and [[unrequited love]], who killed herself two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah unfolds an intensely emotional audio diary, detailing why she decided to end her life. It appears each person who receives this package of old-style tapes is fundamentally related to why she killed herself. Clay is not the first to receive the tapes, but there is implied detail as to how he should pass the tapes on after hearing them. There appears to be an order to distribution of the tapes, with an additional copy held by an overseer should the plan go awry. Each tape recording refers to a different person involved in Hannah's life contributing to a reason for her suicide. The tapes refer to both friends and enemies.

In season two, months after Hannah's suicide, Clay and the other people mentioned on the tapes, as well as close friends and Hannah's family members, become embroiled in a civil legal battle between Hannah's parents and Liberty High School. Alleging negligence on the part of the school, Hannah's mother pursues her perception of justice, while her reluctance to settle pre-trial and her personal circumstances eventually break up her marriage with Hannah's father. The story unfolds with narratives illustrating Hannah's story told by those who present in court at trial. 

Clay, who perceives himself as Hannah's failed protector, embarks on an investigation using whatever evidence he can find in an effort to impact on the civil case between Hannah's parents and the school. Clay also endeavors to expose the corrupted culture of the High School and its favor of wealthy, [[Jock (stereotype)|sports savvy male students]] over the average student, which especially compromises the integrity of young girls such as Hannah.

Throughout season two, Clay appears to be communicating with the ghost of Hannah as a plot narrative device.&lt;!-- , while the factual basis of the dramatic portrayals of the various events increasingly blur between actual portrayal and the desired perception of the various characters who present before the court during the trial. --&gt;

While Hannah is on her way to find a phone to call the authorities, the downed stop sign causes a serious accident at that intersection, resulting in the death of Clay's friend Jeff Atkins, which was incorrectly considered a drunk driving accident. When Hannah tries to tell Clay about the stop sign, he pushes her away, thinking she is being unnecessarily dramatic. In the present, Jessica's behavior becomes more erratic. Clay finds out that Sheri is trying to make up for her mistake in her own way, and he tells Jeff's parents that Jeff was sober when he died.

Tyler eventually suggests they pin everything on Bryce, but Alex refuses and says they should tell the truth. Sheri turns herself in.

==Reception==
===Audience viewership===
The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the first season was the second-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered, garnering 48% of the viewers that the [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'' received, which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. The series also showed an 18% increase in week-over-week viewership from week one to week two. Jumpshot, which "analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.&lt;ref name="JumpshotViewers"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/netflix-marvel-the-defenders-binge-viewing-data-ratings-1202532453/ |title=Netflix's 'Marvel's The Defenders' Poised for Binge-Viewing Pop, Data Indicates |last=Spangler |first=Todd |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=August 18, 2017 |accessdate=August 19, 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sqg1uawF?url=http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/netflix-marvel-the-defenders-binge-viewing-data-ratings-1202532453/ |archivedate=August 20, 2017 |deadurl=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
====Season 1====
The first season has received positive reviews from critics, with much of the praise for the show being aimed at its acting, directing, story, visuals, improvements upon its source material, and mature approach to dark and adult subject matter. The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 80% approval rating with an average rating of 7.2/10, based on 51 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "''13 Reasons Why'' complements its bestselling source material with a gripping look at adolescent grief whose narrative maturity belies its YA milieu."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/13_reasons_why/s01 |title=13 Reasons Why: Season 1 (2017) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=May 22, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401133100/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/13_reasons_why/s01/ |archivedate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 76 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/13-reasons-why |title=13 Reasons Why: Season 1 reviews |website=Metacritic |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406055505/http://www.metacritic.com/tv/13-reasons-why |archivedate=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised ''13 Reasons Why'', giving it a 9.2 out of 10, "Amazing", stating that the show is "a very powerful and hard-hitting series" and "ranks among the best high school dramas of the 21st century".&lt;ref name="IGNresponse"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/05/13-reasons-why-season-1-review |title=13 Reasons Why: Season 1 Review |website=[[IGN]] |date=April 5, 2017 |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406014923/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/05/13-reasons-why-season-1-review |archivedate=April 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave a glowing review for the show, saying, "The drama is sensitive, consistently engaging, and, most importantly, unblinking."&lt;ref name="BGresponse"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/television/2017/03/28/reasons-why-brings-depth-teen-tragedy/WsqUdlmLuDnR8i6SmQi8cP/story.html |title="Yes, '13 Reasons Why' is for young adults.

The acting, particularly Katherine Langford as Hannah and Dylan Minnette as Clay, was frequently mentioned and widely lauded in several reviews. Schedeen of [[IGN]] praised the cast, particularly Minnette and Langford, stating: "Langford shines in the lead role... [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well. Minnette's Clay is, by design, a much more stoic and reserved character... and does a fine job in what's often a difficult role."&lt;ref name="IGNresponse" /&gt; Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying that "watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure", while Schedeen of IGN also agreed, saying that they are "often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another". Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' also praises both actors: "Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible. The actress' performance is full of dynamic range, setting it against Minnette's often more complicated task in differentiating between moods that mostly go from uncomfortable to gloomy to red-eyed, hygiene-starved despair."&lt;ref name="THRresponse" /&gt;

Ryan of ''Variety'' also gave praise to not only the two leads, but also the supporting cast of actors, particularly Kate Walsh's performance as Hannah's mother, which Ryan describes as "career-best work".&lt;ref name="Varietyresponse" /&gt; Positive mentions from various critics, such as Ryan, Feinberg and Schedeen, were also given to the supporting cast of actors (most particularly Alisha Boe, Miles Heizer and Christian Navarro's respective performances of Jessica, Alex and Tony). Liz Shannon Miller of ''[[Indiewire]]'', who enjoyed the show and gave it a positive score of B+, gave praise to the racial, gender and complex diversity of its supporting cast of teens.&lt;ref name="Varietyresponse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNresponse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="THRresponse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Indiewireresponse" /&gt;

Another aspect frequently mentioned within reviews was the show's mature and emotional approach to its dark and adult subject matter. This was favorably reviewed by critics, such as Miller of ''Indiewire'', particularly her statement that "the adult edges to this story ring with honesty and truth."&lt;ref name="Indiewireresponse"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/03/13-reasons-why-review-netflix-suicide-1201799484/ |title='13 Reasons Why' review: Netflix brings a brutally adult edge to a tale of teen suicide |website=[[Indiewire]] |date=March 31, 2017 |last=Miller |first=Liz Shannon |accessdate=April 8, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410050418/https://www.indiewire.com/2017/03/13-reasons-why-review-netflix-suicide-1201799484/ |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller, and Feinberg of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', also stated that the show can be difficult to watch at times,&lt;ref name="THRresponse" /&gt; while Schedeen of IGN states that it is "an often depressing and even uncomfortable show to watch... a pretty emotionally draining experience, particularly towards the end as the pieces really start to fall into place."&lt;ref name="IGNresponse" /&gt;

Numerous critics also praised several other aspects of the show. Feinberg highlighted the show's directors, saying: "A Sundance-friendly gallery of directors including Tom McCarthy, Gregg Araki and Carl Franklin keeps the performances grounded and the extremes from feeling exploitative",&lt;ref name="Indiewireresponse" /&gt; while Gilbert of ''The Boston Globe'' praised the storytelling: "The storytelling techniques are powerful... [as it] builds on the world established in the previous hour, as we continually encounter new facets of Hannah's life and new characters. The background on the show keeps getting deeper, richer."&lt;ref name="BGresponse" /&gt;

Conversely, the series has also received criticism over its portrayal of teen angst. Mike Hale of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a critical review, writing, "the show doesn't make [Hannah's] downward progress convincing. It too often feels artificial, like a very long public service announcement." He also criticized the plot device that has Clay listening to the tapes one by one instead of all in one sitting like the other teens did, which Hale felt was unbelievable: "It makes no sense as anything but a plot device, and you'll find yourself, like Clay's antagonists, yelling at him to listen to the rest of tapes already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hale |first1=Mike |title=Review: '13 Reasons Why' She Killed Herself, Drawn Out on Netflix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |accessdate=April 10, 2017 |work=The New York Times |date=March 30, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410165508/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/arts/television/netflix-13-reasons-why-tv-review.html |archivedate=April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Rebecca Nicholson praised some aspects of the show, including the performances from Minnette and Walsh, but was troubled by much of the plot, writing, "a storyline that suggests the love of a sweet boy might have sorted all this out added to an uneasy feeling that stayed with me". Nicholson was skeptical that the show would appeal to older viewers, unlike other series set in high school such as ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and ''[[My So-Called Life]]'': "It lacks the crossover wit of its forebears... It's too tied up in conveying the message that terrible behaviour can have horrible consequences to deal in any subtleties or shades of feeling. It's largely one-note – and that note is horrifying. 'It has to get better,' implores one student towards the end, but given its fairly open ending, an apparent season two setup, it does not seem as if there's much chance of that happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nicholson |first1=Rebecca |title=13 Reasons Why review – sex, drugs and mixtapes in Netflix's high-school horror show |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/31/13-reasons-why-review-sex-drugs-and-mixtapes-in-netflix-high-school-horror-show |accessdate=April 12, 2017 |work=The Guardian |date=March 31, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411230644/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/31/13-reasons-why-review-sex-drugs-and-mixtapes-in-netflix-high-school-horror-show |archivedate=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Washington Post]]'' television critic [[Hank Stuever]] wrote a negative review, finding ''13 Reasons Why'' "contrived" and implausible: "There are 13 episodes lasting 13 super-sullen hours – a passive-aggressive, implausibly meandering, poorly written and awkwardly acted effort that is mainly about miscommunication, delivering no more wisdom or insight about depression, bullying and suicide than one of those old ''[[After school special|ABC Afterschool Specials]]'' people now mock for being so corny." He also wrote that he found Hannah's suicide tapes "a protracted example of the teenager who fantasizes how everyone will react when she's gone. The story ... strikes me as remarkably, even dangerously, naive in its understanding of suicide, up to and including a gruesome, penultimate scene of Hannah opening her wrists in a bathtub."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stuever |first1=Hank |authorlink=Hank Stuever |title='Thirteen Reasons Why' shows how adults can really mess up teen angst |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/thirteen-reasons-why-shows-how-adults-can-really-mess-up-teen-angst/2017/03/30/c8db5f00-1346-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html |accessdate=April 12, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |date=March 30, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412075447/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/thirteen-reasons-why-shows-how-adults-can-really-mess-up-teen-angst/2017/03/30/c8db5f00-1346-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html |archivedate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Wiegand]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' gave the series a tepid review, saying that it was plagued by character inconsistencies, particularly Hannah. He praised Langford's "stunning performance" but noted, "There are times when we simply don't believe the characters, when what they do or say isn't consistent with who we've been led to believe they are... At times, [Hannah] is self-possessed and indifferent at best to the behavior of the popular kids. At other times, though, relatively minor misperceived slights seem to send her into an emotional tailspin. No doubt, teenagers embody a constant whirl of conflicting emotions, but the script pushes the bounds of credibility here and there." He noted that overall, the series worked: "The structure is gimmicky and the characters inconsistent, but there are still at least ''13 Reasons Why'' the series is worthy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wiegand |first1=David |title='13 Reasons' why Netflix drama works despite gimmickry |url=http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/13-Reasons-why-Netflix-drama-works-despite-11034434.php |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 29, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419192851/http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/13-Reasons-why-Netflix-drama-works-despite-11034434.php |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine Pearson from [[DigitalSpy]] wrote a negative review, calling the season "even more problematic" than the first.

===Social impact===
[[File:1300_Reasons_WHY_NOT.jpg|thumb|[[Rowan University]]'s Counseling and Psychological Services office mocked the show with a campaign challenging students to come up with 1300 reasons not to commit suicide. The expressions of hope were hung in windows alongside mental health contact information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snjtoday.com/story/36565018/rowan-students-faculty-share-1300-reasons-to-live |title=Rowan Students, Faculty Share '1,300 Reasons to Live' |last=Baratti |first=Nina |date=October 10, 2017 |website=SJN Today|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The series has generated controversy over its portrayal of suicide and self-harm, prompting Netflix to add strong advisory warnings prior to the first, twelfth, and thirteenth episodes. School psychologists and educators expressed concern about the series.

The superintendent of [[Palm Beach County, Florida]] schools reportedly told parents that their schools had seen an increase in suicidal and self-harming behavior from students, and that some of those students "have articulated associations of their at-risk behavior to the ''13 Reasons Why'' Netflix series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Balingit |first1=Moriah |title=Educators and school psychologists raise alarms about '13 Reasons Why' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/educators-and-school-psychologists-raise-alarms-about-13-reasons-why/2017/05/01/bb534ec6-2c2b-11e7-a616-d7c8a68c1a66_story.html |accessdate=May 2, 2017 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian youth mental health service for 12–25 year-olds, [[headspace (organisation)|Headspace]], issued a warning in late April 2017 over the graphic content featured in the series, due to the increased number of calls to the service following the show's release in the country. [[Netflix]] however, demonstrably complied with the Australian viewer ratings system, by branding the series as "MA15+" when streamed via its own interface. They accompanied its presentation with additional warnings and viewer advice, and ensured that counselling referrals were included and not easily skipped at the conclusion of each episode, even including an Australian accent in the voice over for those referrals every fifth episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |title=13 Reasons Why: Headspace issues warning over new Netflix show |date=April 18, 2017 |publisher=[[Community Newspaper Group]] |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419101534/http://www.communitynews.com.au/cockburn-gazette/news/13-reasons-headspace-issues-warning-new-netflix-show/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |title=Netflix series 13 Reasons Why under fire from mental health experts |work=news.com.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418233845/http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/headspace-issues-warning-against-netflix-show-13-reasons-why/news-story/02014de19bd8daee573224c0c714eeae |archivedate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |title=headspace: dangerous content in 13 Reasons Why |work=headspace.org.au |accessdate=April 19, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419104903/https://www.headspace.org.au/news/dangerous-content-in-13-reasons-why/ |archivedate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the [[National Association of School Psychologists]] (NASP) in the United States released a statement regarding the series, saying: "Research shows that exposure to another person's suicide, or to graphic or sensationalized accounts of death, can be one of the many risk factors that youth struggling with mental health conditions cite as a reason they contemplate or attempt suicide."&lt;ref name="CNN0425"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Howard |first1=Jacqueline |title=Why teen mental health experts are focused on '13 Reasons Why' |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/25/health/13-reasons-why-teen-suicide-debate-explainer/ |website=CNN |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426055938/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/25/health/13-reasons-why-teen-suicide-debate-explainer/ |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASP sent a letter to school mental health professionals across the country about the series, reportedly a first for NASP in response to a television show.&lt;ref name="rollingstone5217"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blistein |first1=Jon |title=Netflix Adds More Advisory Warnings to '13 Reasons Why' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/netflix-adds-more-advisory-warnings-to-13-reasons-why-w480108 |accessdate=May 2, 2017 |work=Rolling Stone |date=May 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503062903/http://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/netflix-adds-more-advisory-warnings-to-13-reasons-why-w480108 |archivedate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, the United States [[Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology]] (SCCAP) released a statement also noting how strongly the show may serve as a trigger for self-injury among vulnerable youth. They lamented the depiction of mental health professionals as ineffective for youth who have experienced trauma and may have been considering suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Division 53 SCCAP Statement on 13 Reasons Why |url=https://clinicalchildpsychology.org/sccap-statement-13-reasons-why |website=clinicalchildpsychology.org |accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement implored Netflix to add a tag following each episode with mental health resources, and a reminder that depression and suicide can be effectively treated by a qualified mental health professional, such as a clinical child psychologist, using [[evidence-based practice]].

Similarly, [[clinical psychologists]] such as Daniel J. Reidenberg and Erika Martinez, as well as mental health advocate MollyKate Cline of ''Teen Vogue'' magazine, have expressed concerns regarding the risk of [[suicide contagion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=MollyKate |first1=Cline |title=Why '13 Reasons Why' Can Be Triggering for People Coping With Mental Illness |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/25/health/13-reasons-why-teen-suicide-debate-explainer/ |website=Teen Vogue |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426055938/http://edition.cnn.com/2017/04/25/health/13-reasons-why-teen-suicide-debate-explainer/ |archivedate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=Korin |title=13 Reasons Why Is Not the Force for Mental Health Awareness People Say It Is |url=http://www.self.com/story/13-reasons-why-suicide-and-mental-health |date=April 13, 2017 |website=Self |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425205223/http://www.self.com/story/13-reasons-why-suicide-and-mental-health |archivedate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thorbecke |first1=Catherine |title='13 Reasons Why' faces backlash from suicide prevention advocacy group |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/13-reasons-faces-backlash-suicide-prevention-advocacy-groups/story?id=46851551 |website=[[ABC News]] |accessdate=April 25, 2017 |date=April 18, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424112112/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/13-reasons-faces-backlash-suicide-prevention-advocacy-groups/story?id=46851551 |archivedate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eric Beeson, a counselor at The Family Institute at [[Northwestern University]] noted that "it's unlikely that one show alone could trigger someone to attempt suicide."&lt;ref name="CNN0425"/&gt; Mental health professionals have also criticized the series' depiction of suicide itself, much of which violates widely promulgated recommendations for reporting on actual suicides or not depicting them in fiction, in order to not encourage copycat suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reportingonsuicide.org/recommendations/#important |title=Recommendations – Reporting on Suicide |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408043809/http://reportingonsuicide.org/recommendations/ |archivedate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season finale, which depicts Hannah's suicide in graphic detail, has been particularly criticized in this regard.&lt;ref name="Slate piece"&gt;{{cite news |last=Martinelli |first=Marissa |title=''13 Reasons Why'''s Controversial Depiction of Teen Suicide Has School Counselors Picking Up the Pieces |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/05/01/school_counselors_talk_netflix_s_controversial_teen_suicide_drama_13_reasons.html |newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]] |date=May 1, 2017 |accessdate=May 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502022611/http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/05/01/school_counselors_talk_netflix_s_controversial_teen_suicide_drama_13_reasons.html |archivedate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nic Sheff, a writer for the show, has defended it as intended to dispel the myth that suicides "quietly drift off", and recalled how he himself was deterred from a suicide attempt by recalling a survivor's account of how painful and horrifying it was.&lt;ref name="Sheff Vanity Fair essay"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sheff |first=Nic |title=''13 Reasons Why'' Writer: Why We Didn't Shy Away from Hannah's Suicide |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/13-reasons-why-suicide-controversy-nic-sheff-writer |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=April 13, 2017 |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASP statement also criticized the show's suggestion that bullying alone led Hannah to take her life, noting that while it may be a contributing factor, suicidal ideations far more often result from the bullied person having a treatable mental illness without adequate [[coping mechanism]]s. Alex Moen, a [[school counselor]] in Minneapolis, took issue with the show's entire plotline as "...essentially a fantasy of what someone who is considering suicide might have—that once you commit suicide, you can still communicate with your loved ones, and people will suddenly realize everything that you were going through and the depth of your pain ... That the cute, sensitive boy will fall in love with you and seek justice for you, and you'll be able to orchestrate it, and in so doing kind of still be able to live."&lt;ref name="Slate piece" /&gt; Other counselors criticized the depiction of Hannah's attempt to reach out to Mr. Porter as dangerously misleading, since not only does he miss obvious signs of her suicidal ideations, but says he cannot report her sexual assault to the police without her identifying the assailant. School counselors are often portrayed as ineffective or clueless in popular culture, Moen says, but Porter's behavior in the series goes beyond that, to being unethical and possibly illegal. "It's ridiculous! Counselors are not police. We don't have to launch an investigation. We bring whatever information we do have to the police", she told ''[[Slate (website)|Slate]]''.&lt;ref name="Slate piece" /&gt;

In May 2017, the [[Canadian Mental Health Association]] (CMHA) along with the Centre for Suicide Prevention (CSP) released a statement with similar concerns to the ones raised by NASP. CMHA believed that the series may glamorize suicide, and that some content may lead to distress in viewers, particularly in younger viewers. Furthermore, the portrayal of Hannah's suicide does not follow the media guidelines as set out by the Canadian Association for Suicide Prevention (CASP) and the [[American Association of Suicidology]]. CMHA and CASP did praise the show for raising awareness about "...[[suicide|this preventable health concern]]," adding that, "Raising awareness needs to be done in a safe and responsible manner. A large and growing body of Canadian and international research has found clear links between increases in suicide rates and harmful media portrayals of suicide." Ways in which the portrayals of suicide may cause harm, according to CMHA and CASP, include the following: "They may simplify suicide, such as, by suggesting that bullying alone is the cause; they may make suicide seem romantic, such as, by putting it in the context of a Hollywood plot line; they may portray suicide as a logical or viable option; they may display graphic representations of suicide which may be harmful to viewers, especially young ones; and/or they may advance the false notion that suicides are a way to teach others a lesson."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |title=CMHA National Statement Responding to Netflix Series: 13 Reasons Why – Canadian Mental Health Association |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504044326/http://www.cmha.ca/news/cmha-national-statement-responding-netflix-series-13-reasons/ |archivedate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasponline.org/assets/documents/Resources%20and%20Publications/Resources/Crisis/13%20Reasons%20Why%20Guidance_FINAL.pdf National Association of School Psychologists.

One study found the release of ''13 Reasons Why'' corresponded with between 900,000 and 1,500,000 more suicide-related searches in the United States, including a 26% increase in searches for "how to commit suicide," an 18% increase for "commit suicide," and a 9% increase for "how to kill yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ayers |first1=John W. |last2=Althouse |first2=Benjamin M. |last3=Leas |first3=Eric C. |last4=Dredze |first4=Mark |last5=Allem |first5=Jon-Patrick |title=Internet Searches for Suicide Following the Release of ''13 Reasons Why'' |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine |date=2017 |volume=177 |issue=10 |pages=1527–1529 |doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.3333 |pmid=28759671 |pmc=5820689}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review, however, found that it is unclear if searching for information about suicide on the Internet relates to the risk of suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mok |first1=K |last2=Jorm |first2=AF |last3=Pirkis |first3=J |title=Suicide-related Internet use: A review. |journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |date=August 2015 |volume=49 |issue=8 |pages=697–705 |doi=10.1177/0004867415569797 |pmid=25698810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Mei Mei (Zhu Lin) a 16-year-old Chinese orphan who has been supported by donations from her Australian sponsor Dean Randall ([[Guy Pearce]]), who sends her postcards that describe his family life. When her orphanage choir travels to Australia to participate in an Australian Choir Festival, Mei Mei takes the opportunity to find Dean with the hope he will make her part of his family. However, Mei Mei discovers the shocking truth – Dean is actually a convict in prison for manslaughter. Seeing Dean as her last chance at finding a home, Mei Mei decides to stay in Sydney until Dean gets his parole, in the meantime becoming naively entangled in the criminal world herself. To save Mei Mei from his own fate, Dean must make an impossible sacrifice.

==Development==
''33 Postcards'' was developed under the title ''Mei Mei''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12199&amp;Section=2011_The_Year_Ahead_Part_2 |title=The Australian Film Institute &amp;#124; The Year Ahead Part 2 |publisher=Afi.org.au |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235549/http://www.afi.org.au/AM/ContentManagerNet/HTMLDisplay.aspx?ContentID=12199&amp;Section=2011_The_Year_Ahead_Part_2 |archivedate=30 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''Mei Mei'' was one of only two Australian screenplays selected from 475 submissions to partake in the [[Tribeca Film Institute]] program, Tribeca All Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/fsa_090324_tribeca.aspx |title=Media Releases |publisher=Screen Australia |date=24 March 2009 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403082231/https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/fsa_090324_tribeca.aspx |archive-date=3 April 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The screenplay also featured as one of only three selected for [[Dungog Film Festival]] as part of the in the Raw Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encoremagazine.com.au/in-the-raw-becomes-stand-alone-event-6454 |title=In the Raw becomes stand-alone event |publisher=Encore Magazine |date=13 January 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721160906/http://www.encoremagazine.com.au/in-the-raw-becomes-stand-alone-event-6454 |archive-date=21 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coproduction===
''33 Postcards'' is an [[official film and television co-production in Australia]]. The co-production is between Australia and China, for which a co-production treaty did not exist prior to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stolz |first=Greg |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/australia-and-china-form-film-alliance/story-e6frf7ko-1225963329881 |title=Australia and China form film alliance |publisher=Herald Sun |date=30 November 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''33 Postcards'' is only the second film to be produced under this treaty and the first co-production between NSW and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenhub.com.au/news/shownewsarticleG.asp?newsID=34424 |title=Mei Mei: in  post post |publisher=Screen Hub |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=26 May 2011}} {{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This opportunity for co-productions to exist between China and Australia is largely unrealised in both countries, but has been identified as a potentially lucrative endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenqueensland.com.au/the-vault/marketing-reports/268-australia-china-industry-form-freshwater-pictures.html |title=Australia-China Industry Form (Freshwater Pictures) |publisher=Screenqueensland.com.au |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910063224/http://www.screenqueensland.com.au/the-vault/marketing-reports/268-australia-china-industry-form-freshwater-pictures.html |archive-date=10 September 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/filmmakers-say-hello-to-chinawood-20110607-1fqty.html |title=Filmmakers say hello to Chinawood |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Lead actress Zhu Lin began production knowing little more than a dozen words in the English language.&lt;ref name="screendaily1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hatherley |first=Frank |url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/latest-reviews/-33-postcards/5028614.article |title=33 Postcards |publisher=Screendaily.com |date=10 June 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot in both Australia and Zhejiang Province, China.

===Live cabaret===
On September 20, 2014, ''#SOBLESSEDLIVE'', a cabaret version of '' #SOBLESSED: The Annoying Actor Friend's Guide to Werking in Show Business '' was performed at the acclaimed NYC venue, [[54 Below]]. Featuring performances from [[Corey Cott]], [[Lesli Margherita]], Nic Rouleau, and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/corey-cott-kyle-dean-massey-lesli-margherita-keala-settle-nic-rouleau-join-actor_friend-54below-tonight-331012|title=Corey Cott, Kyle Dean Massey, Lesli Margherita, Keala Settle, Nic Rouleau Join @Actor_Friend @54Below Tonight - Playbill|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the performance followed the format of the book, telling the story of a working New York actor, from college to working on Broadway, and beyond. Later iterations of the concert were performed with new cast members on February 7, 2015, and July 27, 2015.

==Movements==

===Actors' Equity Association===
In November 2013, AnnoyingActorFriend.com released a portion of ''#SOBLESSED'' that featured the history of Broadway touring productions, and the recent decline in salary and working conditions suffered by touring actors, due to tiered production contracts and the new Short Arrangement Touring Agreement (SETA). The following month, audition notices were posted for the national tours of [[Kinky Boots (musical)]] and [[Newsies (musical)]], which confirmed rumors that the tours were going to be going out on Tier C and Tier D production contracts, which dictate a significantly reduced salary for touring actors, in comparison to their Broadway counterparts. Through its web site, Annoying Actor Friend encouraged Actor's Equity Association (AEA) union members to band together in order to prevent the further decline of their working conditions and salaries. By January, Annoying Actor Friend had garnered enough attention that AEA council members announced that they would devote an entire member meeting to the subject of touring contracts, and ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article on the state of Broadway touring productions citing Annoying Actor Friend's contribution to igniting the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/theater/on-the-road-actors-seek-higher-pay.html|title=On the Road, Actors Seek Higher Pay|date=27 January 2014|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===#Dim4Joan===
Shortly after [[Joan Rivers]] died on September 4, 2014, [[The Broadway League]] announced that they would not dim Broadway's marquees to honor the famous comedian, actress, and Broadway supporter. On September 8, Annoying Actor Friend created the hashtag #Dim4Joan, urging fellow tweeters to use the hashtag as a means of convincing the Broadway League to change its mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/audra-mcdonald-donna-murphy-steve-kazee-and-more-stars-of-broadway-rally-on-330054 |title=Audra McDonald, Donna Murphy, Steve Kazee and More Stars of Broadway Rally on Twitter to #Dim4Joan |publisher=Playbill.com |date=2014-09-09 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hashtag rapidly reached trending status. Beginning with Jordan Roth, theatre owners began to announce that they would dim their marquees on September 9, at 6:45 PM. The League ultimately released an official statement saying that all Broadway theaters would dim their marquees to honor Rivers. A similar movement, #Dim4Kyle, occurred in August 2015, following the premature death of [[Kyle Jean-Baptiste]], who made history on July 23, 2015 as the first African-American and youngest actor to play Jean Valjean in ''[[Les Miserables]]'' on Broadway.

==Awaresie Awards==
Created to honor contributions made to the Broadway community that are not recognized by the [[Tony Award]]s, the first annual Awaresie Awards ceremony was released online via [[YouTube]] on June 1, 2015, and featured many of Annoying Actor Friend's frequent collaborators, such as [[Krysta Rodriguez]] and [[Megan Hilty]], as presenters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/watch-smash-and-broadway-stars-announce-winners-of-actor_friends-awards-for-things-the-tonys-leave-out-350321|title=Watch 'Smash' and Broadway Stars Announce Winners of @Actor_Friend's Awards for Things 'The Tonys Leave Out'  - Playbill|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other accolades==
In 2014, Annoying Actor Friend wrote a monthly column for ''[[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]]'' called "The Working Actor." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/topics/Annoying%20Actor%20Friend/|title=Backstage|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blessedterns==
On October 1, 2014, Annoying Actor Friend announced the addition of an intern personality, known as @Blessedterns, to his/her brand. The account is currently run by Ashlee Latimer, and functions as a satirical commentary on intern and fan culture within the Broadway and larger theatrical community.

In television, '''cancellation''' refers to the termination of a [[television program|program]] by a [[television network|network]], typically because of low viewership, financial losses, or unfavourable critical reviews. Other potential reasons for canceling television programs include controversies involving the program's cast, conflicts among the show's staff members or to make room for new programming.

Shows whose runs end due to a mutual creative decision by its creators, producers, cast, and the network it airs on (such as ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', or ''[[The Cosby Show]]'') are not considered to be "cancelled" but rather "concluded" or "ended", with a special last episode called its [[series finale]]. Even so, programs that end their runs in this manner are sometimes incorrectly stated to have been cancelled, even if the program was renewed for a final season (such as with ''[[American Idol]]'', by which the term was incorrectly applied upon the announcement of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[Fremantle Media]] and [[19 Entertainment]]'s decision to renew the show for a 15th and final season in May 2015 to air in 2016);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='American Idol' canceled after 15th season|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/05/11/media/american-idol-cancelled/|author=Chris Isidore|work=[[CNNMoney]]|date=May 11, 2015|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I'm Relieved American Idol Is Cancelled|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jio-f-deslate/why-im-relieved-american-_b_7282284.html|author=
Jio F. Deslate|website=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='American Idol' Cancelled, Will End Next Year After 15th Season|url=http://radio.com/2015/05/11/american-idol-cancelled-15th-season/|author=Shannon Carlin|website=[[Radio.com]]|publisher=[[CBS Corporation|CBS Local Media]]|date=May 11, 2015|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that are cancelled traditionally end their runs during the television season in which the program airs first-run episodes at the time, either effective immediately after the announcement is made by the network or until all remaining episodes are broadcast.

The [[Friday night death slot]] is a perceived [[graveyard slot]] in [[United States|American]] television, referring to the idea that a television program in the United States scheduled on Friday evenings is destined for imminent cancellation.

== Overview ==
[[Commercial television]] is supported by [[television advertisement|advertising]], or viewers paying for TV-channels. Viewing figures are collected by [[audience measurement]] ratings agencies (such as [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] in the United States), and the programs with the highest viewing figures command a higher advertising fee for the network. As such, shows with a low viewership are generally not as [[profit (economics)|profit]]able. For most United States networks, the number of viewers within the 18–49 age range is more important than the total number of viewers.&lt;ref name=demos&gt;{{cite news | author = Storey, Michael | url = http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2009/apr/23/tv-column-not-18-49-age-group-tv-execs-wr-20090423/ | title = THE TV COLUMN: Not in 18–49 age group? TV execs write you off | date = 2009-04-23 | work = [[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]] | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news | author = Carter, Bill | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/business/media/07adco.html | title = An ‘Idol’ Ratings Loss, but Not in Its Pocketbook | date = April 6, 2010 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = April 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Advertising Age'', during the 2007–08 season, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' was able to charge $419,000 per [[television commercial]], compared to only $248,000 for a commercial during ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average.&lt;ref name=demos2&gt;{{cite news | author = Santiago, Rosario | url = http://www.buddytv.com/articles/greys-anatomy/for-advertising-purposes-greys-11849.aspx | title = For Advertising Purposes, 'Grey's Anatomy' May Well be Colored Green | date = 2007-10-03 | work = [[BuddyTV]] | accessdate = 2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its strength in young demographics, ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'' was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial as ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', even though the two [[television series]] had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together.&lt;ref name=demos/&gt; (A slight exception to this is [[CBS]], whose self-stated target audience is persons 25 to 54 years old; because of this, CBS programs tend to favor slightly older audiences than their broadcast rivals.)

Other factors are considered as well, such as the cost to produce the show. For example, a [[game show]] costs less money to produce than a [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] program, so even if the game show has lesser ratings it may survive cancellation because of the higher [[profit margin]]. Game shows and self-contained reality shows, which can be produced on short order with very little preparation compared to scripted series and annual contests, may not be canceled in the same way, but merely have the network cease ordering episodes and end up in limbo; in turn, these types of shows are also easily brought back if a network needs to produce filler programming quickly (as was the case with ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? (U.S. game show)|Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]'', which was renewed more than three years after it had produced its last episode because of a programming shortage on Fox).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/06/fox-revives-are-you-smarter-than-a-5th-grader/324831/|title=FOX Revives 'Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader'|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 6, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the show is produced by the network or an outside company can also factor into a show's future; networks, especially in the 21st century, tend to prefer shows that are produced in-house, as they can take advantage of [[vertical integration]] and, in addition to making money from the first run of the show on the network, continue to profit from [[broadcast syndication|syndicating]] the [[rerun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/05/19/networks-may-struggling-new-shows-keep-coming/ | title=Networks may be struggling, but the new shows keep coming| date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if two shows have similar ratings and expenses but one is produced by the network while the other is held by an outside company, the outsider program is more likely to be canceled. This was not an issue in the late 20th century, when [[Financial Interest and Syndication Rules]] prohibited American networks from owning syndicators.

Very rarely are television programs cancelled for reasons other than ratings or profitability. Notable cases are ''[[Turn-On]]'' and ''[[Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos]]'', which were canceled after viewer and station outrage; ''[[Bridget Loves Bernie]]'', which was forced off the air despite high ratings because of threats of violence from Jewish radicals; ''[[Roseanne]]'', which was canceled despite extremely strong ratings over objections to title star [[Roseanne Barr]]'s social media comments; ''[[Home Run Derby (TV series)|Home Run Derby]]'', which was canceled due to the host's death; and ''[[Megan Wants a Millionaire]]'', which was canceled in August 2009 following the [[Murder of Jasmine Fiore|arrest warrant (and later, suicide) of one of the finalists]].

==Saved from cancellation==
Occasionally, a show may be brought back into production after being previously cancelled. Such was the case with ''[[Unforgettable (2011 TV series)|Unforgettable]]'', a CBS crime drama that was canceled in 2012, but was revived in the summer of 2013. Sometimes, one network may decide to air a series previously cancelled by another network. For example, ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' and ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'' both moved from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to [[CBS]] in its ninth and final season of production. This is an uncommon occurrence, and few programs have successfully made audience gains when changing networks.

In other cases, overwhelming fan response may lead to a show's revival. The original series of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' was given an additional season after a letter-writing campaign from fans. Another successful letter-writing campaign helped revive ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brooke |last=Tarnoff |title=Fans Save The Endangered Series - Jericho is Resurrected |url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17250&amp;sectionId=25 |work=UGO|accessdate=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2007 in television|2007]], ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'' was given an additional seven-episode order after fans mailed thousands of pounds of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] to network executives (a reference to a pivotal line in the season finale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Jericho' Repeats Land on Fridays|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-jerichorepeatstofriday,0,5958453.story?coll=zap-tv-headlines |work=Zap2It |date=2007-06-12 |accessdate=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong [[home video]] sales and viewership on [[cable television|cable]] have also helped revive a series. ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and ''[[Police Squad!]]'' were revived in the form of theatrical [[film]]s (an uncommon occurrence, since failed television series are usually not considered bankable movie material), ''[[Family Guy]]'' was returned to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark |last=Wright |title=Nuts to Jericho! |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/06/nuts_to_jericho.php |work=The Stage |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2007-06-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183648/http://www.thestage.co.uk/tvtoday/2007/06/nuts_to_jericho.php |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Futurama]]'' (the volume 5 DVD cover touts the tag line "back by popular harassment!") returned in the form of [[Direct-to-video|straight to video]] films and a subsequent series of new television episodes for [[Comedy Central]] (although Comedy Central would later cancel the show itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Wallenstein |title=New drama for 'Futurama' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002726964 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2006-06-23 |accessdate=2007-06-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235233/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002726964 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'' was revived for a fourth season in 2013 (seven years after being canceled by [[Fox (TV network)|Fox]]) as a [[Netflix]] Original Series, after episodes of its initial run proved popular on the streaming service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/business/media/arrested-development-returns-on-netflix.html?_r=0 | title='Arrested Development' Returns on Netflix| newspaper=The New York Times| date=2013-05-23| last1=Stelter| first1=Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some situations, a television series may be revived years after being cancelled. Often this is in the form of a spin-off show featuring new characters (such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' which premiered eighteen years after the original series went off the air). ''[[Doctor Who]]'', which was cancelled by the BBC in [[1989 in television|1989]], was brought back in [[2005 in television|2005]] as a continuation of the original run of shows. Both franchises also produced spin-off films in the periods they were cancelled. This approach has seen increased exposure in the 2010s, with shows such as ''[[Girl Meets World]]'' (a follow-up to ''[[Boy Meets World]]''), ''[[Fuller House (TV series)|Fuller House]]'' (a follow-up to ''[[Full House (TV series)|Full House]]''), ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' and ''[[Roseanne]] '' all returning to television approximately a full generation after the original series aired.

==Cancellation in pop culture== 
* The [[Adult Swim]] TV series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' ends each season with a running gag in which the head of the network cancels the show, although the show has never actually been considered for cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/you-cant-do-that-on-robot-chicken.html "Robot Chicken": You Can't Do That on Robot Chicken] - ''[[Adult Swim Video]]'' (accessed September 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.adultswim.com/robot-chicken/in-memoriam.html "Robot Chicken": In Memoriam] - ''Adult Swim Video'' (accessed September 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
* On ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', the episode "The Last of Mary Moo Cow" deals with the cancellation of D.W.'s favorite show, ''Mary Moo Cow''. The fictional show is later revived in both episodes.
* On ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', the episodes "Binky Gets Cancelled" and "Binky Gets Cancelled Again!" deal with the cancellation of Garfield's favorite show ''The Binky Show''. The fictional show is later revived.
* On ''[[The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'', the entire show is cancelled in 1964, and Rocky and Bullwinkle feels sad and melancholy. Boris, Natasha and Fearless convinces Minnie Mogul into producing "The Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle" movie and 6 months later, Karen Sympathy gets the show out of reruns, by bringing Rocky and Bullwinkle into the real world and stopping RBTV (Really Bad Television) in New York. RBTV later becomes ''Rocky and Bullwinkle Television'' and Karen and Ole sees the Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle movie when the Narrator, Rocky and Bullwinkle returns home in the new movie.
*The ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Cancelled (South Park)|Cancelled]]" deals with the boys discovering Earth is merely an intergalactic reality TV show and trying to stop its cancellation after the rest of earth discovers the truth.
* ''[[The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!]]'' faces the cancellation before the gang plots to bring their own show back.
* In the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' series finale episode ''Mitefall'', [[Bat-Mite]] has grown weary of ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'', deeming its formula to be tired and repetitive, so he concocts a scheme to make it so bad that the network will have to cancel the show to make way for [[Beware the Batman|a darker one]].
* In the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' Season 4 episode 43 and 44 ''The Self-Indulgent 200th Episode Spectacular, Part 1'' and ''The Self-Indulgent 200th Episode Spectacular, Part 2'' the Teen Titans deal with being cancelled despite the episode not being the last.

'''Circus Roncalli''' is a German [[circus]] founded in 1976 by [[Bernhard Paul]] and [[André Heller]]. According to Bernhard Paul, the name was inspired by a film script of his fellow Austrian Peter Hajek, "Sarah Roncalli, Tochter des Mondes" ("Sarah Roncalli, daughter of the moon", sometimes also cited as "widow of the moon").&lt;ref name="Wiener Journal"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.wienerzeitung.at/Docs/2009/9/21/wj1809_web.pdf | author=Ziegler, Mathias | title=Bernhard Paul: Traum vom Zirkus | journal=Wiener Journal | year=2009 |issue=38 | accessdate=2011-02-21 | pages=14–17 | language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reminiscence to the popular [[Pope John XXIII]] (1881–1963), whose legal name was ''Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli'', served as a key to the success.&lt;ref name="Wiener Journal" /&gt;

==History==
The first performance of the circus was on 18 May 1976 on the ''Hofgartenwiese'' in [[Bonn]], and the tour finished on 16 August 1976 in [[Munich]]. After the first season, Paul and Heller disagreed about the concept and rights, so that at a future  performance on 4 June 1980 in [[Cologne]], Bernhard Paul directed the circus on his own.  (In September 1976 there were already performances without Heller in Vienna, but the show closed after a short run owing to a dwindling audience.)  Since then, the circus has toured in Germany and abroad, including the first appearance of a West German circus in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1986. Model-turned-photographer [[Ellen von Unwerth]] worked as an assistant at Circus Roncalli in Munich for around a month when she was eighteen years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Unwerth|first1=Ellen|title=Ellen von Unwerth - In Fashion - SHOWstudio Interview|url=https://showstudio.com/project/in_fashion/ellen_von_unwerth|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FASHION/PHOTOGRAPHY: ELLEN VON UNWERTH|url=https://prettyandwittyandbrightphotography.wordpress.com/2015/07/11/fashionphotography-ellen-von-unwerth/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winter quarters==
The winter quarters of the circus have been at Neurather Weg 7 in [[Mülheim (Cologne)|Mülheim, Cologne]] since 1984. The building belonged to [[Circus Williams]] beforehand, and was rebuilt to accommodate Circus Roncalli, following which it was officially opened on 27 April 1986.

==Roncalli Museum==
Bernhard Paul owns one of the largest circus collections in Europe, including old costumes, circus books and posters, which he plans to display in a museum.

==Projects==
Circus Roncalli has taken part in a number of projects:

* The "Höhner rockin Roncalli Show" – Tours with the musical group [[De Höhner]].
* "Circus meets Classic" – Performances by artists based on classical music performed by various symphony orchestras.
* Performances with the musical group [[the Kelly Family]] in 2003 and 2004 (''Phantasie verboten''), and in 2005 and 2006 ("Music meets Circus – Circus meets Music").
* A Christmas circus (''Roncalli Weihnachtscircus''), which has been held in the [[Tempodrom]] in Berlin from December to January since 2004
* The dinner show "Witzigmann &amp; Roncalli Bajazzo", together with [[Eckart Witzigmann]] since autumn 2006
* Historical Christmas market in front of the [[Hamburg Rathaus]].

== Transport ==
Bernhard Paul prefers railway transport, which is becoming more difficult because some of the loading facilities of the [[Deutsche Bahn]] are no longer in use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">'''Colortrak 2000''' was one of [[RCA (trademark)|RCA]]'s brand names for their [[high-end]] [[television]] models produced from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, the other being [[Dimensia]]. The RCA ''[[Colortrak]]'', however, was not a high-end model. As opposed to ColorTrak, ColorTrak 2000 models incorporated a comb filter, which provided a sharper picture.  The [[Colortrak]] 2000 [[chassis]] was identical to the Dimensia tabletop model. Colortrak 2000s with [[BNC connector]]s were given the designation of [[Lyceum TV]]s. This TV set was also used with RCA's [[Digital Command Component System]] released in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19851008&amp;id=FdklAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JPwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4857,2361280&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The Colortrak 2000, unlike the Dimensia, only came in three chassis, which was simulated [[woodgrain]], or real oak [[Wood veneer|veneer]]  or black with the [[loudspeaker|speakers]] located on the sides. As stated earlier, this exact chassis was used for one variation of the Dimensia.

==Features==
{{main|Lyceum TV}}

Colortrak 2000s had a wide array of high-end features such as a large [[input/output]] panel on the back, which included [[BNC connector|BNC]] connections, and advanced [[video]] features. The Colortrak 2000s from 1983 and later came with the [[Digital Command Center]], a large and very advanced [[remote control]]. The same remote was also used for all the Dimensias, except it was called ''[[Dimensia Intelligent Audio Video]]''.

'''''Dogville''''' is a 2003 [[International co-production|internationally co-produced]] [[avant-garde]] [[crime film|crime]] [[Revenge play|revenge tragedy film]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=6TlQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=dogville+revenge+tragedy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KPh3UpSs1X&amp;sig=HS7bTHANRc_DRRhf5EoKTn6Yv2w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWqfTZjpDcAhVHgK0KHaUCAo0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dogville%20revenge%20tragedy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; written and directed by [[Lars von Trier]], and starring an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Paul Bettany]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Stellan Skarsgård]], [[Udo Kier]], [[Ben Gazzara]], and [[James Caan]]. It is a [[parable]] that uses an extremely minimal, [[Stage (theater)|stage]]-like [[set (drama)|set]] to tell the story of Grace Mulligan (Kidman), a woman hiding from [[Gangster|mobsters]], who arrives in the small mountain town of Dogville, [[Colorado]], and is provided refuge in return for physical labor.

The film is the first in von Trier's projected ''USA&amp;nbsp;– Land of Opportunities'' [[trilogy]], which was followed by ''[[Manderlay]]'' (2005) and is projected to be completed with ''Wasington'' (sic). The film was in competition for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4072375/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Dogville |accessdate=2009-11-05|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Gus Van Sant]]'s ''[[Elephant (2003 film)|Elephant]]'' won the award. It was screened at various [[film festival]]s before receiving a [[limited release]] in the US on March 26, 2004.

''Dogville'' opened to polarized reviews from critics. Some considered it to be pretentious or exasperating; it was viewed by others as a masterpiece,&lt;ref name="BFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/film/4ce2b85bbfe0f |title=''Dogville'' (2003) |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has grown in stature since its initial release.

==Plot structure==
The story of ''Dogville'' is told in nine chapters and a prologue, with a one-sentence description of each chapter given in the film, in the vein of such chapter headings in many 19th-century novels. These descriptions are given below.

===Prologue===
:''Which introduces us to the town and its residents''
Dogville is a very small [[United States|American]] town by an abandoned [[silver mine]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]], with a road leading up to it and nowhere else to go but the mountains. The film begins with a prologue in which a dozen or so of the fifteen citizens are introduced. They are portrayed as lovable, good people with small flaws which are easy to forgive.

The town is seen from the point of view of Tom Edison Jr., an aspiring writer who procrastinates by trying to get his fellow citizens together for regular meetings on the subject of "[[Moral Re-Armament|moral rearmament]]". It is clear that Tom wants to succeed his aging father, a physician, as the moral and spiritual leader of the town.

===Chapter 1===
:''In which Tom hears gunfire and meets Grace''
It is Tom who first meets Grace Mulligan, who is on the run from gangsters who presumably shot at her. Grace, a beautiful but modest woman, wishes to keep running, but Tom assures her that the mountains ahead are too difficult to pass. As they talk, the gangsters approach the town, and Tom quickly hides Grace in the nearby mine. One of the gangsters asks Tom if he has seen the woman, which he denies. The gangster then offers him a reward and hands him a card with a phone number to call in case Grace shows up.

Tom decides to use Grace as an "illustration" in his next meeting—a way for the townspeople to prove that they are indeed committed to community values, can receive a gift, and are willing to help the stranger. They remain skeptical, so Tom proposes that Grace should be given a chance to prove that she is a good person. Grace is accepted for two weeks in which, as Tom explains to her after the meeting, she must gain the friendship and trust of the townspeople.

===Chapter 2===
:''In which Grace follows Tom's plan and embarks upon physical labor''
On Tom's suggestion, Grace offers to do chores for the citizens—talking to the lonely, blind Jack McKay, helping to run the small shop, looking after the children of Chuck and Vera, and so forth. After some initial reluctance, the people accept her help in doing those chores that "nobody really needs" but which nevertheless make their lives easier. As a result, she becomes an accepted part of the community.

===Chapter 3===
:''In which Grace indulges in a shady piece of provocation.''
In tacit agreement Grace is expected to continue her chores, which she does gladly, and is even paid small wages which she saves up to purchase a set of seven expensive porcelain figurines, one at a time, from Ma Ginger's shop. Grace begins to make friends, including Jack, who pretends that he is not blind. She earns his respect upon tricking him into admitting that he is blind. Once the two weeks are over, everyone votes at the town meeting that Grace should be allowed to stay.

===Chapter 4===
:''Happy times in Dogville''
Things go well in Dogville until the police arrive to place a "Missing" poster featuring Grace's picture and name on the mission house. With the townspeople divided as to whether they should cooperate with the police, the mood of the community darkens somewhat.

===Chapter 5===
:''Fourth of July after all''
Still, things continue as usual until the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] celebrations. After Tom awkwardly admits his love to Grace which she reciprocates and the whole town expresses their agreement that it has become a better place thanks to her, the police arrive again to replace the "Missing" poster with a "Wanted" poster. Grace is now wanted for participation in a bank robbery. Everyone agrees that she must be innocent, since at the time the robbery took place, she was doing chores for the townspeople every day.

Nevertheless, Tom argues that because of the increased risk to the town now that they are harboring someone who is wanted as a criminal, Grace should provide a [[quid pro quo]] and do more chores for the townspeople within the same time, for less pay. At this point, what was previously a voluntary arrangement takes on a slightly coercive nature as Grace is clearly uncomfortable with the idea. Still, being very amenable and wanting to please Tom, Grace agrees.

===Chapter 6===
:''In which Dogville bares its teeth''
At this point the situation worsens, as with her additional workload, Grace inevitably makes mistakes, and the people she works for seem to be equally irritated by the new schedule—and take it out on Grace. The situation slowly escalates, with the male citizens making small sexual advances to Grace and the females becoming increasingly abusive. Even the children are perverse: Jason, the 10-year-old son of Chuck and Vera, asks Grace to spank him, until she finally complies after much provocation (von Trier has noted that this is the first point in the film where it is clear how completely Grace's lack of social status and choices makes her vulnerable to other people manipulating her).&lt;ref&gt;von Trier in the dvd audio commentary track, Ch.6&lt;/ref&gt; The hostility towards Grace finally reaches a turning point as well when Chuck rapes her in his home.

===Chapter 7===
:''In which Grace finally gets enough of Dogville, leaves the town, and again sees the light of day.''
That evening, Grace tells Tom what had happened and he starts to form a plan for her escape. The next day, Vera confronts Grace for spanking her son Jason and Liz informs her that a few people saw Tom leave her shack very late the night before, casting suspicions on her virtue. The next evening she is confronted again by Vera, Liz and Martha in her shack. Martha witnessed a sexual encounter between Chuck and her in the apple orchard. Vera blames her for seducing her husband and decides to punish Grace by destroying the figurines. Grace begs her to spare them and tries to remind Vera of all the good things she has done for her including teaching her children the philosophy of [[stoicism]]. Vera cruelly uses it against her while destroying the figurines she worked hard for. Grace goes to Tom that evening and they decide to bribe the freight truck driver Ben to smuggle her out of town in his truck. En route, she is raped by Ben, after which the truck lumbers only to return Grace to Dogville.

The town agrees that they must not let her escape again. The money paid to Ben to help Grace escape had been stolen by Tom from his father—but when Grace is blamed for the theft, Tom refuses to admit he did it because, as he explains, this is the only way he can still protect Grace without people getting suspicious. So Grace finally becomes a slave: she is chained, repeatedly raped, and abused by the people of the town. She is also humiliated by the children who ring the church bell every time she is violated, much to Tom's disgust.

===Chapter 8===
:''In which there is a meeting where the truth is told and Tom leaves (only to return later).''
This culminates in a late night general assembly in which Grace—following Tom's suggestion—relates calmly all that she has endured from everyone in town, then heads back to her shack. Embarrassed and in complete denial, the townspeople finally decide to get rid of her. As Tom tells Grace this, declaring his allegiance to her over the town, he attempts to make love to her. Still chained, she responds to his advances by saying "...lt would be so beautiful, but from the point of view of our love so completely wrong. We were to meet in freedom."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/dogville-script-transcript-nicole-kidman.html&lt;/ref&gt; She questions if thoughts of using force against her are in fact why he is so upset, noting that he could have her if he wants—all he needs to do is threaten her to get his way, as the others have done. Tom defends his intentions as pure, but upon reflection realizes that what she says is true. Shaken by self-doubt, he decides it would jeopardize his career as a philosopher if this doubt were allowed to grow. To rid himself of its source, he decides to personally call the mobsters and turn Grace over.

===Chapter 9 and ending===
:''In which Dogville receives the long-awaited visit and the film ends''
When the mobsters finally arrive, they are welcomed cordially by Tom and an impromptu committee of other townspeople. Grace is then freed by the indignant henchmen, and her true identity is revealed: she is the daughter of a powerful gang leader who ran away because she could not stand his dirty work. Her father motions her into his [[Cadillac]] and argues with her about issues of morality. After some introspection, Grace reverses herself and comes to the conclusion that Dogville's crimes cannot be excused due to the difficulty of their circumstances. Tom, who has become aware that the mobsters pose a threat to himself and the town, is momentarily remorseful, but rapidly descends into rationalization for his actions. Grace sadly return to her father's car, accepts his power, and uses it to command that Dogville be removed from the earth.

Grace tells the gangsters to make Vera watch her children die, as punishment for destroying her figurines. Dogville is burned to the ground and all of its inhabitants brutally massacred with the exception of Tom, whom she executes personally with a revolver right after he applauds the effectiveness of her use of illustration as an attempt to get her to spare him. After the massacre, the gangsters hear a barking sound from one of the houses. It is the dog Moses. A gangster aims a gun at the dog, but Grace commands that it should live: "He's just angry because I once took his bone." The chalk drawing of Moses becomes a real dog as his barks lead into the credits.

==Pilot==
''Dogville: The Pilot'' was shot during 2001 in the pre-production phase to test whether the concept of chalk lines and sparse scenery would work. The 15-minute pilot film starred Danish actors [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (as Grace) and [[Nikolaj Lie Kaas]] (as Tom). Eventually [[Lars von Trier]] was happy with the overall results. As a result, he and the producers decided to move forward with the production of the feature film. The test pilot was never shown in public, but is featured on the second disc of the ''Dogville'' (2003) DVD, released in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413956/ ''Dogville: The Pilot'' on IMDb]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staging==
The story of ''Dogville'' is narrated by [[John Hurt]] in nine chapters and takes place on a stage with minimalist scenery. Some walls and furniture are placed on the stage, but the rest of the scenery exists merely as white painted outlines which have big labels on them; for example, the outlines of [[gooseberry]] bushes have the text "Gooseberry Bushes" written next to them. While this form of staging is common in [[black box theater]]s, it has rarely been attempted on film before—the [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[film musical|musical]] ''[[Red Garters (film)|Red Garters]]'' (1954) and ''[[Vanya on 42nd Street]]'' (1994) being notable exceptions. The bare staging serves to focus the audience's attention on the acting and storytelling, and also reminds them of the film's artificiality. As such it is heavily influenced by the theatre of [[Bertolt Brecht]]. (There are also similarities between the song "Seeräuberjenny" ("[[Pirate Jenny]]") in Brecht and [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[Die Dreigroschenoper]]'' (''The Threepenny Opera'') and the story of Dogville.&lt;ref&gt;Marit Kapla: ''[http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/online_features/our_town.php Our Town]''. Filmmaker Magazine, June 11, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chico Buarque]]'s version of this song, [[Geni e o Zepelim]] [''Geni and the Zeppelin''], deals with the more erotic aspects of abjection and bears striking similarity to von Trier's cinematic homage to the song.) The film does however employ carefully designed lighting to suggest natural effects such as the moving shadows of clouds, and sound effects are used to create the presence of non-existent set pieces (e.g., there are no doors, but the doors can always be heard when an actor "opens" or "closes" one).

The film was shot on [[high-definition video]] using a [[Sony HDW-F900]] camera in a studio in [[Trollhättan]], [[Sweden]].

==Interpretations==
According to von Trier, the point of the film is that "evil can arise anywhere, as long as the situation is right".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/movies/dogville-it-fakes-a-village.html?pagewanted=3 |title='Dogville'&amp;nbsp;– It Fakes a Village |work=The New York Times |date=March 21, 2004 |accessdate=2010-02-25 | first=A. O. | last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper|Ebert and Roeper]] criticized ''Dogville'' as having a strongly [[anti-American]] message, citing, for example, the closing credits sequence with images of poverty-stricken Americans [taken from [[Jacob Holdt]]'s documentary book ''American Pictures'' (1984)] accompanied by [[David Bowie]]'s song "[[Young Americans (song)|Young Americans]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040409/REVIEWS/404090303/1023 |title=Reviews: ''Dogville''|date=April 9, 2004|author=Ebert, Roger |work=Sun Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical===
''Dogville'' divided critics upon its United States theatrical release, with Metacritic giving it a score of 60 ("Mixed or average reviews")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dogville |title=Dogville Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Rotten Tomatoes]] critics' consensus for it stating simply, "A challenging piece of experimental filmmaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dogville/ |title=Dogville (2003) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hailed it as an innovative and powerful artistic statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/09/DDGHV61J081.DTL&amp;type=movies |title='Dogville'' as poetic as it is powerful |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |publisher=''San Francisco Chronicle'' |date=April 9, 2004 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}} "[...] mischievous, singular, and profound."&lt;/ref&gt; while others considered it to be an emotionally detached or even [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] work. In ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[J. Hoberman]] wrote, "For passion, originality, and sustained chutzpah, this austere allegory of failed Christian charity and Old Testament payback is von Trier's strongest movie--a masterpiece, in fact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/the-grace-of-wrath-6407914 |title=The Grace Of Wrath |last=Hoberman |first=J. |publisher=''The Village Voice'' |date=March 16, 2004 |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film 3.5/4 stars, praising Kidman's performance and dubbing it "a movie that never met a cliche it didn't stomp on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/dogville-20040326 |title=Dogville |last=Travers |first=Peter |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date=March 23, 2004 |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Foundas of ''[[LA Weekly]]'' described it as a work of "boldness, cutting insight, [and] intermittent hilarity," and interpreted it as "a potent parable of human suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/film/once-upon-a-time-in-amerika-2137956 |title=Once Upon a Time in Amerika |last=Foundas |first=Scott |publisher=''LA Weekly'' |date=March 25, 2004 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', Alan Morrison wrote that "''Dogville'', in a didactic and politicised stage tradition, is a great play that shows a deep understanding of human beings as they really are."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/dogville/review/ |title=Dogville Review |last=Morrison |first=Alan |publisher=''Empire'' |date= |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on the other hand, [[Manohla Dargis]] dismissed it as "three hours of tedious experimentation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/26/entertainment/et-dog26 |title=Seduced by ideas? |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |publisher=''The Los Angeles Times'' |date=March 26, 2004 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[TIME (magazine)|TIME]]'' argued that von Trier lacked humanity and wrote that the director "presumably wants us to attend to his characters' yearnings and prejudices without the distractions of period furnishings. It's a brilliant idea, for about 10 minutes. Then the bare set is elbowed out of a viewer's mind by the threadbare plot and characterizations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040412-607794,00.html |title=Empty Set, Plot to Match |last=Corliss |first=Richard |publisher=''TIME'' |date=April 4, 2004 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], who gave it two out of four stars, felt that the film was so pedantic as to make von Trier comparable to a [[Crank (person)|crank]], and viewed it as "a demonstration of how a good idea can go wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dogville-2004 |title=Dogville Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2004) |last=Ebert |first=Roger |date=April 9, 2004 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', Sean Axmaker said, "There's no denying von Trier is visually intriguing. [...] But as an artist, his contempt for humanity is becoming harder to hide with stylistic flourish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/movies/article/Von-Trier-s-stylistic-Dogville-is-muzzled-by-1142370.php |title=Von Trier's stylistic 'Dogville' is muzzled by its contempt for humanity |last=Axmaker |first=Sean |publisher=''Seattle Post-Intelligencer |date=April 15, 2004 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Taylor of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' additionally responded to allegations of the film's anti-Americanism with the charge that it was "anti-human", and said that it was "as total a misanthropic vision as anything control freak [[Stanley Kubrick]] ever turned out"—while personally admitting that he felt von Trier was as deliberate a filmmaker as Kubrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2004/03/26/dogville/ |title="Dogville" |last=Taylor |first=Charles |publisher=''Salon'' |date=March 23, 2004 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, ''Dogville'' was named one of the greatest films of its decade in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/dec/23/best-films-noughties-dogville Best films of the noughties No 8: Dogville]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The List (magazine)|The List]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://film.list.co.uk/article/22425-best-of-a-decade-film/ Best of a decade: film]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/11/50-best-movies-of-the-decade-2000-2009.html?a=1 50 Best Movies of the Decade (2000-2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications. In 2016, it was ranked one of the 100 greatest motion pictures since 2000 in a critics' poll conducted by [[BBC|BBC Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to aggregator ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They'', it is the 20th most acclaimed film of the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theyshootpictures.com/21stcentury_allfilms_table.php 21st Century (Full List)]&lt;/ref&gt;

American director and screenwriter [[Quentin Tarantino]] has named the film as one of the 20 best to have been released during the time of his active career as a director;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcast.net/slideshow/entertainment-tarantinotop20/8/ Quentin Tarantino's Top 20 Favorite Films]&lt;/ref&gt; he said that if it had been written for the stage, von Trier would have won a [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv0WlHbBhdc&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial===
The film grossed $1,535,286 in the US market and $15,145,550 from the rest of the world for a total gross of $16,680,836 worldwide. In the opening US weekend it did poorly, grossing only $88,855. The movie was released in only nine theaters, however, with an average of $9,872 per theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=dogville.htm |title=Dogville (2004) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date= |accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Denmark, the film grossed $1,231,984.&lt;ref name="foreign-grosses"&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&amp;id=dogville.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest-grossing country was Italy, with $3,272,119.&lt;ref name="foreign-grosses"/&gt;

'''''Famous Film Festival''''' was [[United States|American]] [[television program|television's]] first prime-time movie series. It aired Sunday nights 7:30-9:00 pm (EST) on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the [[1955–56 United States network television schedule|1955-56 television season]], switching to Saturday nights (7:30-9 pm) during its second and final season, [[1956-57 United States network television schedule|1956-57]].

In 1955, ABC obtained the rights to broadcast 35 British movies, the rights of which were owned by English film mogul [[J. Arthur Rank]]. Titles of these included ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' (1943), ''[[The Lavender Hill Mob]]'' (1951), ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' (1947),  ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (1945 film)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945), ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948),  and ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' (1948). However, many of these, such as ''Hamlet'', ran two full hours or longer, and were either drastically cut to fit a ninety-minute time slot or shown in two installments a week apart. It was not until November 3, 1956, with CBS's first presentation of MGM's ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), that an uncut film lasting more than ninety minutes was telecast in one evening on a television network.

Unfortunately, all films in this series were broadcast in black-and-white, despite the fact that several of them had been originally photographed and exhibited theatrically in color. Thus, such films as ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|Stairway to Heaven]]'' (1946) and ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943) would not be seen by American viewers in color until years later when they were released for rental and exhibition by local and independent television stations.

Other British films from [[J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors|J. Arthur Rank Productions]] obtained at the same time were shown as part of ABC's daytime ''[[Afternoon Film Festival]]'', which aired weekdays from 3:00-5:00 pm (ET). This show premiered January 16, 1956 and ended August 2, 1957, replaced by ''[[American Bandstand]]'', which introduced [[Dick Clark]] to network television audiences and went on to become one of daytime's most popular programs, especially with teenagers.

After re-running ''[[Meet Me Tonight|Tonight at 8:30]]'' on June 8, ABC ceased airing its ''Famous Film Festival'' series. Instead, through the summer of 1957, the network used its 7:30-9:00 time-slot on Saturdays to broadcast televised sermons by [[Billy Graham]] and then later (beginning July 6) ABC aired ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Country Music Hayride]]''.&lt;ref&gt;TV listings, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 1956-August 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early years===
García Lorca was born on 5 June 1898, in [[Fuente Vaqueros]], a small town a few miles west of [[Granada]], southern Spain.&lt;ref Name="Maurerix"/&gt; His father, Federico García Rodríguez, was a prosperous landowner with a farm in the fertile ''vega'' (valley) surrounding Granada and a comfortable villa in the heart of the city. García Rodríguez saw his fortunes rise with a boom in the sugar industry. García Lorca's mother, Vicenta Lorca Romero, was a teacher. After Fuente Vaqueros, the family moved in 1905 to the nearby town of [[Valderrubio]] (at the time named Asquerosa). In 1909, when the boy was 11, his family moved to the regional capital of Granada; their best known residence there is the summer home known as the Huerta de San Vicente, on what was then the outskirts of the city of Granada. For the rest of his life, he maintained the importance of living close to the natural world, praising his upbringing in the country.&lt;ref Name="Maurerix"&gt;Maurer (2001) pix&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these homes—Fuente Vaqueros, Valderrubio, and Huerta de San Vicente—are today museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patronatogarcialorca.org/casamuseo.php|title=Patronato Federico García Lorca, Fuentevaqueros, Granada, Spain|website=www.patronatogarcialorca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museolorcavalderrubio.com/|title=Casa Museo Federico Garcia Lorca - Valderrubio|website=www.museolorcavalderrubio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huertadesanvicente.com/recuerdos.php|title=Huerta de San Vicente|website=huertadesanvicente.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, after graduating from secondary school, García Lorca attended the [[University of Granada]]. During this time his studies included law, literature and composition. Throughout his adolescence he felt a deeper affinity for music than for literature. When he was 11 years old, he began six years of piano lessons with Antonio Segura Mesa, a harmony teacher in the local conservatory and a composer. It was Mesa who inspired Federico's dream of developing a career in music.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;Stevenson, R. (2007). ""Musical moments" in the Career of Manuel de Falla's Favorite Friend Federico García Lorca." Inter-American Music Review, 17(1-2), 265-276. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1310726{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first artistic inspirations arose from the scores of [[Claude Debussy]], [[Frédéric Chopin]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt; Later, with his friendship with composer [[Manuel de Falla]], Spanish folklore became his muse. García Lorca did not begin a career in writing until Segura died in 1916, and his first prose works such as "Nocturne", "Ballade" and "Sonata" drew on musical forms.&lt;ref Name="Maurerx"&gt;Maurer (2001) px&lt;/ref&gt; His milieu of young artists gathered in El Rinconcillo at the cafe Alameda in Granada. During 1916 and 1917, García Lorca traveled throughout [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[León (historical region)|León]], and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], in northern Spain, with a professor of his university, who also encouraged him to write his first book, ''{{lang|es|Impresiones y Paisajes}}'' (''Impressions and Landscapes'' – printed at his father's expense in 1918). [[Fernando de los Rios]] persuaded García Lorca's parents to let him move to the progressive, [[Oxbridge]]-inspired [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid in 1919, while nominally attending classes at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]].&lt;ref Name="Maurerx"/&gt;

===As a young writer===
[[File:Huerta de San Vicente.jpg|thumb|Huerta de San Vicente, summer home of Lorca's family in Granada, Spain, now a museum]]
At the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, García Lorca befriended [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] and many other creative artists who were, or would become, influential across Spain.&lt;ref Name="Maurerx"/&gt; He was taken under the wing of the poet [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], becoming close to playwright [[Eduardo Marquina]] and [[Gregorio Martínez Sierra]], the Director of [[Madrid]]'s Teatro Eslava.&lt;ref Name="Maurerx"/&gt; In 1919–20, at Sierra's invitation, he wrote and staged his first play, ''[[The Butterfly's Evil Spell]]''. It was a verse play dramatising the impossible love between a cockroach and a butterfly, with a supporting cast of other insects; it was laughed off the stage by an unappreciative public after only four performances and influenced García Lorca's attitude to the theatre-going public for the rest of his career. He would later claim that ''[[Mariana Pineda]]'', written in 1927, was, in fact, his first play. During the time at the Residencia de Estudiantes, he pursued degrees in law and philosophy, though he had more interest in writing than study.&lt;ref Name="Maurerx"/&gt;

García Lorca's first book of poems was published in 1921, collecting work written from 1918 and selected with the help of his brother Francisco (nicknamed Paquito). They concern the themes of religious faith, isolation and nature that had filled his prose reflections.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxi"&gt;Maurer (2001) pxi&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1922 at Granada García Lorca joined the composer [[Manuel de Falla]] in order to promote the [[Concurso de Cante Jondo]], a festival dedicated to enhance [[flamenco]] performance. The year before Lorca had begun to write his ''Poema del cante jondo'' ("Poem of the Deep Song", not published until 1931), so he naturally composed an essay on the art of [[flamenco]],&lt;ref&gt;Federico García Lorca, "El cante jondo (Primitivo canto andaluz)" (1922), reprinted in a collection of his essays entitled ''Prosa'' (Madrid: Alianza Editorial 1969, 1972) at 7–34.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to speak publicly in support of the ''Concurso''. At the music festival in June he met the celebrated [[Manuel Torre]], a flamenco cantador. The next year in Granada he also collaborated with Falla and others on the musical production of a play for children, adapted by Lorca from an [[Andalucia]]n story.{{efn|The play was titled ''La niña que riega la albahaca y el príncipe preguntón''.}}&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Cano, ''García Lorca'' (Barcelona: Salvat Editores 1985) at 54–56 (''Concurso''), at 56–58 (play), and 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the same structural form of sequence as "Deep song", his collection ''Suites'' (1923) was never finished and not published until 1983.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxi"/&gt;

Over the next few years, García Lorca became increasingly involved in Spain's [[avant-garde]]. He published a poetry collection including ''[[Cancion]]'' (''Song''). Shortly after, Lorca was invited to exhibit a series of drawings at the [[Galeries Dalmau#1927: Federico García Lorca|Galeries Dalmau]] in Barcelona, from 25 June – 2 July 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.girona.cat/viewer.vm?id=2934456&amp;view=dalmau&amp;lang=en ''Exposició de dibuixos de Federico García Lorca'', Galeries Dalmau, 25 June – 2 July 1927, Barcelona (invitation and catalogue)]&lt;/ref&gt; Lorca's sketches were a blend of popular and avant-garde styles, complementing ''Canción''. Both his poetry and drawings reflected the influence of traditional [[Andalusians|Andalusian]] motifs, Cubist syntax, and a preoccupation with sexual identity. Several drawings consisted of superimposed dreamlike faces (or shadows). He later described the double faces as self-portraits, showing "man's capacity for crying as well as winning", inline with his conviction that sorrow and joy were inseparable, just as life and death.&lt;ref name="Stainton"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=sSPQXJGRt6oC&amp;pg=PT502&amp;dq=galeries+dalmau,+Federico+Garc%C3%ADa+Lorca.+1927&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl6eyn1ufaAhWCthQKHej8CeUQ6AEIKTAA#v=snippet&amp;q=dalmau&amp;f=false Leslie Stainton, ''Lorca - a Dream of Life''], Bloomsbury Publishing, 2013, {{ISBN|1448213444}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Romancero Gitano'' (''Gypsy Ballads'', 1928), part of his Cancion series, became his best known book of poetry.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxii"&gt;Maurer (2001) pxii&lt;/ref&gt; It was a highly stylised imitation of the ballads and poems that were still being told throughout the Spanish countryside. García Lorca describes the work as a "carved altar piece" of Andalusia with "gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its Jewish and Roman breezes, rivers, crimes, the everyday touch of the smuggler and the celestial note of the naked children of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]]. A book that hardly expresses visible Andalusia at all, but where the hidden Andalusia trembles".&lt;ref Name="Maurerxii"/&gt; In 1928, the book brought him fame across Spain and the Hispanic world, and it was only much later that he gained notability as a playwright. For the rest of his life, the writer would search for the elements of Andaluce culture, trying to find its essence without resorting to the "picturesque" or the cliched use of "local colour".&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiii"&gt;Maurer (2001) pxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

His second play, ''[[Mariana Pineda]]'', with stage settings by Salvador Dalí, opened to great acclaim in [[Barcelona]] in 1927.&lt;ref Name="Maurerx"/&gt; In 1926, García Lorca wrote the play ''[[The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife (play)|The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife]]'', which would not be shown until the early 1930s. It was a farce about fantasy, based on the relationship between a flirtatious, petulant wife and a hen-pecked shoemaker.

[[File:Postal de Federico a Antonio de Luna.jpg|thumb|Postcard from Lorca and Dalí to Antonio de Luna, signed "Federico." "Dear Antonito: In the midst of a delicious ambience of sea, phonographs and cubist paintings I greet you and I hug you. Dalí and I are preparing something that will be 'moll bé.' Something 'moll bonic.' Without realizing it, I have deposited myself in the Catalan. Goodbye Antonio. Say hello to your father.  And salute yourself with my finest unalterable friendship. You've seen what they've done with Paquito! (Silence)"  Above, penned by Dalí: "Greetings from Salvador Dalí"]]

From 1925 to 1928, he was passionately involved with Dalí.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]: "From 1925 to 1928, García Lorca was passionately involved with Salvador Dalí. The intensity of their relationship led García Lorca to acknowledge, if not entirely accept, his own homosexuality."&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship with Lorca had a strong element of mutual passion,{{efn|For more in-depth information about the Lorca-Dalí connection see ''Lorca-Dalí: el amor que no pudo ser'' and ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dalí'', both by [[Ian Gibson (author)|Ian Gibson]].}} but Dalí  rejected the erotic advances of the poet.&lt;ref name="conversations"&gt;Bosquet, Alain, ''[http://www.ubu.com/historical/dali/dali_conversations.pdf Conversations with Dalí]'', 1969. p. 19–20. (PDF format) (of García Lorca) 'S.D.: He was homosexual, as everyone knows, and madly in love with me. He tried to screw me twice... I was extremely annoyed, because I wasn't homosexual, and I wasn't interested in giving in. Besides, it hurts. So nothing came of it. But I felt awfully flattered vis-à-vis the prestige. Deep down I felt that he was a great poet and that I owe him a tiny bit of the Divine Dalí's asshole.'&lt;/ref&gt; With the success of "Gypsy Ballads", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of a love affair with sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could acknowledge only in private. He also had the sense that he was being pigeon-holed as a "gypsy poet". He wrote: "The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast".&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiii"/&gt; Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when [[surrealist]]s Dalí and [[Luis Buñuel]] collaborated on their 1929 film ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (''An Andalusian Dog''). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself.&lt;ref&gt;Buñuel, Luis. ''My Last Sigh''. Translated by Abigail Israel. University of Minnesota Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8166-4387-3}}. P. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Dalí also met his future wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]]. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to take a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.

In June 1929, García Lorca travelled to the US with Fernando de los Rios on the ''[[RMS Olympic]]'', a sister liner to the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiv"/&gt; They stayed mostly in New York City, where Rios started a lecture tour and García Lorca enrolled at [[Columbia University School of General Studies]], funded by his parents. He studied English but, as before, was more absorbed by writing than study. He also spent time in [[Vermont]] and later in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. His collection ''Poeta en Nueva York'' (''A Poet in New York'', published posthumously in 1942) explores alienation and isolation through some graphically experimental poetic techniques and was influenced by the [[Wall Street crash]] which he personally witnessed. This condemnation of urban capitalist society and materialistic modernity was a sharp departure from his earlier work and label as a folklorist.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiv"&gt;Maurer (2001) pxiv&lt;/ref&gt; His play of this time, ''[[The Public (play)|El Público]]'' (''[[The Public (play)|The Public]]''), was not published until the late 1970s and has never been published in its entirety, the manuscript lost. However, the Hispanic Society of America in New York City retains several of his personal letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hispanicsociety.org/|title=Hispanic Society of America|date=16 October 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lorcanyc.com/program|title=Lorca in NY|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Second Republic===
[[File:Lorca CloseUp.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Lorca in the [[Plaza de Santa Ana]], Madrid]]
García Lorca's return to Spain in 1930 coincided with the fall of the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic]].&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiv"/&gt; In 1931, García Lorca was appointed director of a student theatre company, Teatro Universitario La Barraca (The Shack). It was funded by the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic's]] Ministry of Education, and it was charged with touring Spain's rural areas in order to introduce audiences to radically modern interpretations of classic Spanish theatre free of charge. With a portable stage and little equipment, they sought to bring theatre to people who had never seen any, with García Lorca directing as well as acting. He commented: "Outside of Madrid, the theatre, which is in its very essence a part of the life of the people, is almost dead, and the people suffer accordingly, as they would if they had lost their two eyes, or ears, or a sense of taste. We [La Barraca] are going to give it back to them".&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiv"/&gt; His experiences traveling through impoverished rural Spain and New York (particularly amongst the disenfranchised African American population), transformed him into a passionate advocate of the theatre of social action.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiv"/&gt; He wrote "The theatre is a school of weeping and of laughter, a free forum, where men can question norms that are outmoded or mistaken and explain with living example the eternal norms of the human heart".&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiv"/&gt;

While touring with ''La Barraca'', García Lorca wrote his now best-known plays, the ''Rural Trilogy'' of ''[[Blood Wedding]]'', ''[[Yerma]]'' and ''[[The House of Bernarda Alba]]'', which all rebelled against the norms of bourgeois Spanish society.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxiv"/&gt; He called for a rediscovery of the roots of European theatre and the questioning of comfortable conventions such as the popular drawing-room comedies of the time. His work challenged the accepted role of women in society and explored taboo issues of homoeroticism and class. García Lorca wrote little poetry in this last period of his life, declaring in 1936, "theatre is poetry that rises from the book and becomes human enough to talk and shout, weep and despair." &lt;ref Name="Maurerxv"&gt;Maurer (2001) pxv&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Federicogarcialorca1.jpg|thumb|Bust of Federico García Lorca in [[Santoña]], Cantabria]]
Travelling to Buenos Aires in 1933 to give lectures and direct the Argentine premiere of ''Blood Wedding'', García Lorca spoke of his distilled theories on artistic creation and performance in the famous lecture ''Play and Theory of the [[Duende (art)|Duende]]''. This attempted to define a schema of artistic inspiration, arguing that great art depends upon a vivid awareness of death, connection with a nation's soil, and an acknowledgment of the limitations of reason.&lt;ref Name="Maurerxv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Arriving Where We Started'' by Barbara Probst, 1998. She interviewed surviving FUE/Barraca members in Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as returning to the classical roots of theatre, García Lorca also turned to traditional forms in poetry. His last poetic work, ''Sonetos de amor oscuro'' (''[[Sonnets of Dark Love]]'', 1936), was long thought to have been inspired by his passion for Rafael Rodríguez Rapun, secretary of La Barraca. Documents and mementos revealed in 2012 suggest that the actual inspiration was Juan Ramírez de Lucas, a 19-year-old with whom Lorca hoped to emigrate to Mexico.&lt;ref name =Guardian&gt;{{Citation | last = Tremlett| first = Giles| title = Name of Federico García Lorca's lover emerges after 70 years: Box of mementoes reveals that young art critic Juan Ramírez de Lucas had brief affair with Spanish poet | publisher = The Guardian| place = UK| date = 10 May 2012 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/may/10/name-garcia-lover-emerges}}&lt;/ref&gt; The love sonnets are inspired by the 16th-century poet [[San Juan de la Cruz]].&lt;ref Name="Maurerxvii"&gt;Maurer (2001) pxvii&lt;/ref&gt; La Barraca's subsidy was cut in half by the rightist government elected in 1934, and its last performance was given in April 1936.

Lorca spent summers at the Huerta de San Vicente from 1926 to 1936. Here he wrote, totally or in part, some of his major works, among them ''[[When Five Years Pass]]'' (''Así que pasen cinco años'') (1931), ''Blood Wedding'' (1932), ''Yerma'' (1934) and ''[[Diván del Tamarit]]'' (1931–1936). The poet lived in the Huerta de San Vicente in the days just before his arrest and assassination in August 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huertadesanvicente.com/e_pre_huerta.php |title=Huerta de San Vicente |publisher=Huerta de San Vicente |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and social tensions had greatly intensified after the murder of prominent monarchist and anti-[[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] spokesman [[José Calvo Sotelo]] by [[Guardia de Asalto|Republican Assault Guards]] ([[Guardia de Asalto|Guardias de Asalto]]).&lt;ref&gt;Zhooee,'' [[Time Magazine]]'', 20 July 1936&lt;/ref&gt; García Lorca knew that he would be suspect to the rising [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] for his outspoken [[Socialism|socialist]] views.&lt;ref name="Maurerxvii" /&gt; Granada was so tumultuous that it had not had a mayor for months; no one dared accept the job. When Lorca's brother-in-law, Manuel Fernández-Montesinos, agreed to accept the position, he was assassinated within a week. On the same day he was shot, 18 August, Lorca was arrested.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1996 255"&gt;{{cite book |title= El assasinato de García Lorca |last= Gibson |first= Ian |authorlink= |year= 1996 |publisher= Plaza &amp; Janes  |location= Barcelona|isbn= 978-84-663-1314-8|page= 255 |url= |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that García Lorca was shot and killed by Nationalist militia&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A very short introduction.'' Oxford University. 2006. Press.p.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. The ''Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. London. p.100&lt;/ref&gt; on 19 August 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution &amp; Revenge.'' Harper Perennial. London. 2006. pp.107–108&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Ian Gibson (author)|Ian Gibson]] in his book ''The Assassination of García Lorca'' alleges that he was shot with three others (Joaquín Arcollas Cabezas, Francisco Galadí Melgar and Dióscoro Galindo González) at a place known as the Fuente Grande ('Great Spring') which is on the road between [[Víznar]] and [[Alfacar]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ian. ''The Assassination of Federico García Lorca.'' Penguin Books. London. 1983. p.164&lt;/ref&gt; Police reports released by radio station [[Cadena SER]] in April 2015 conclude that Lorca was executed by fascist forces. The Franco-era report, dated 9 July 1965, describes the writer as a "socialist" and "freemason belonging to the Alhambra lodge", who engaged in "homosexual and abnormal practices".&lt;ref&gt;López, Alexandro. ''Documents confirm fascists murdered Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca.'' http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/04/30/lorc-a30.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cadena Ser. ''Los documentos sobre la muerte de Lorca.'' http://cadenaser.com/ser/2015/04/22/album/1429728588_493577.html#1429728588_493577_1429729133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El Pais "Lorca murdered after confessing, says Franco-era police report" http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/04/23/inenglish/1429783994_803509.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant controversy exists about the motives and details of Lorca's murder. Personal, non-political motives have been suggested. García Lorca's biographer, Stainton, states that his killers made remarks about his sexual orientation, suggesting that it played a role in his death.&lt;ref&gt;Stainton, ''Lorca: A Dream of Life''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Gibson (author)|Ian Gibson]] suggests that García Lorca's assassination was part of a campaign of mass killings intended to eliminate supporters of the [[Marxist]] [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]].&lt;ref Name="Gibson 1996 255"/&gt; However, Gibson proposes that rivalry between the right-wing [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA) and the fascist [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falange]] was a major factor in Lorca's death. Former CEDA Parliamentary Deputy [[Ramón Ruiz Alonso]] arrested García Lorca at the Rosales's home, and was the one responsible for the original denunciation that led to the arrest warrant being issued.

It has been argued that García Lorca was apolitical and had many friends in both Republican and Nationalist camps. [[Ian Gibson (author)|Gibson]] disputes this in his 1978 book about the poet's death.&lt;ref name="Gibson 1996 255"/&gt; He cites, for example, ''[[Mundo Obrero]]'s'' published manifesto, which Lorca later signed, and alleges that Lorca was an active supporter of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= El assasinato de García Lorca |last= Gibson |first= Ian |authorlink= |year= 1996 |publisher= Plaza &amp; Janes  |location= Barcelona|isbn= 978-84-663-1314-8|page= 52 |url= |language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorca read this manifesto out loud at a banquet in honour of fellow poet [[Rafael Alberti]] on 9 February 1936.

Many anti-communists were sympathetic to Lorca or assisted him. In the days before his arrest he found shelter in the house of the artist and leading [[FET y de las JONS|Falange]] member [[Luis Rosales]]. Indeed, evidence suggests that Rosales was very nearly shot as well by the Civil Governor Valdés for helping García Lorca. Poet [[Gabriel Celaya]] wrote in his memoirs that he once found García Lorca in the company of [[Falangism|Falangist]] José Maria Aizpurua. Celaya further wrote that Lorca dined every Friday with Falangist founder and leader [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Arnaud Imatz, "La vraie mort de Garcia Lorca" 2009 40 [[La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire]], 31–34, at p. 31-2, quoting from the Memoirs}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 1937 an article appeared in the [[Falangist]] press denouncing the murder and lionizing García Lorca; the article opened: "The finest poet of Imperial Spain has been assassinated."&lt;ref&gt;Luis Hurtado Alvarez, Unidad (11 March 1937)&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Louis Schonberg also put forward the 'homosexual jealousy' theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= "Federico Garcia Lorca. L'homme – L'oeuvre" 1956 (Paris, Plon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dossier on the murder, compiled at [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s request and referred to by Gibson and others, has yet to surface. The first published account of an attempt to locate Lorca's grave can be found in British traveller and Hispanist [[Gerald Brenan]]'s book ''The Face of Spain''.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Brenan, ''The Face of Spain'', Chapter 6, 'Granada'. (Serif, London, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite early attempts such as Brenan's in 1949, the site remained undiscovered throughout the Franco era.

==Excavation at Alfacar==
[[File:Lorca Olive Tree.jpg|thumb|upright|The site of the excavation as it was in 1999]]

In late October 2009, a team of archaeologists and historians from the University of Granada began excavations outside [[Alfacar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abend |first=Lisa |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1932879,00.html |title="Time" article 2009 "Exhuming Lorca's remains and Franco's ghosts" |publisher=Time.com |date=29 October 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was identified three decades previously by a man who claimed to have helped dig Lorca's grave.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson p 467–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Giles Tremlett in Madrid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/18/federico-garcia-lorca-grave-alfacar |title=article "Spanish archeologists fail to find Federico García Lorca's grave" |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=14 August 2012 |location=London |date=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorca was thought to be buried with at least three other men beside a winding mountain road that connects the villages of Víznar and Alfacar.&lt;ref&gt;"Lorca's Granada" p.113–123&lt;/ref&gt;

The excavations began at the request of another victim's family.&lt;ref name = BBC/&gt; Following a long-standing objection, the Lorca family also gave their permission.&lt;ref name = BBC/&gt; In October 2009 Francisco Espínola, a spokesman for the Justice Ministry of the [[Andalusia]]n regional government, said that after years of pressure García Lorca's body would "be exhumed in a matter of weeks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Woolls |first=Daniel |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2010004347_apeuspaincivilwar.html?syndication=rss |title=Seattle Times article Oct 2009 |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=5 October 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorca's relatives, who had initially opposed an exhumation, said they might provide a [[DNA]] sample in order to identify his remains.&lt;ref name = BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Kingstone |first=Steve |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8331049.stm |title=article 28 October 2009 |publisher=BBC News |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late November 2009, after two weeks of excavating the site, organic material believed to be human bones was recovered. The remains were taken to the [[University of Granada]] for examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theleader.info/article/20640/spain/costa-del-sol/lorcas-grave-first-bones-found/ |title="The Leader" Article "First bones found" |publisher=Theleader.info |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225113141/http://www.theleader.info/article/20640/spain/costa-del-sol/lorcas-grave-first-bones-found/ |archivedate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in mid-December 2009, doubts were raised as to whether the poet's remains would be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-44806720091217?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true Reuters – "Doubts rise over Spanish poet Lorca's remains"].&lt;/ref&gt; The dig produced "not one bone, item of clothing or bullet shell", said Begoña Álvarez, justice minister of Andalucia. She added, "the soil was only 40cm (16in) deep, making it too shallow for a grave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8421210.stm |title=article "Spanish dig fails to find grave of poet Lorca" |publisher=BBC News |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Giles Tremlett in Madrid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/18/federico-garcia-lorca-grave-alfacar |title=article Dec 18 09 – "No remains found" |publisher=Guardian |accessdate=14 August 2012 |location=London |date=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failed excavation cost €70,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/lorca-s-grave-may-be-uncovered-78-years-after-execution-1.2023059 The Irish Times, ''Lorca’s grave may be uncovered 78 years after execution'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, a local historian, Miguel Caballero Pérez, author of  "The last 13 hours of García Lorca",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elimparcial.es/libros/miguel-caballero-perez-las-trece-ultimas-horas-en-la-vida-de-garcia-lorca-89324.html |title="Las trece ultimas horas en la vida de Garcia Lorca" (in Spanish) |publisher=Elimparcial.es |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied for permission to excavate another area less than half a kilometre from the site, where he believes Lorca's remains are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Govan |first=Fiona |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/8997854/New-search-underway-for-civil-war-grave-of-poet-Lorca.html# |title=New search underway for civil war grave of poet Lorca|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2014-03-19 |location=London |date=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims in 2016, by Stephen Roberts, an associate professor in Spanish literature at Nottingham University, and others that the poet's body was buried in a well in Alfacar have not been substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/13/remains-of-federico-garca-lorca-hidden-at-the-bottom-of-a-well/|title=Remains of Federico García Lorca 'hidden at the bottom of a well'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship==
[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangist]] regime placed a general ban on García Lorca's work, which was not rescinded until 1953. That year, a (censored) ''Obras completas'' (''Complete Works'') was released. Following this, ''Blood Wedding'', ''Yerma'' and ''The House of Bernarda Alba'' were successfully played on the main Spanish stages. ''Obras completas'' did not include his late heavily homoerotic ''Sonnets of Dark Love'', written in November 1935 and shared only with close friends. They were lost until 1983/4 when they were finally published in draft form. (No final manuscripts have ever been found.) It was only after Franco's death that García Lorca's life and death could be openly discussed in Spain. This was due not only to political censorship, but also to the reluctance of the García Lorca family to allow publication of unfinished poems and plays prior to the publication of a critical edition of his works.

South African Roman Catholic poet [[Roy Campbell (poet)|Roy Campbell]], who enthusiastically supported the Nationalists both during and after the Civil War, later produced acclaimed translations of Lorca's work. In his poem, ''The Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca'', Campbell wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Not only did he lose his life
By shots assassinated:
But with a hammer and a knife
Was after that 
– translated.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Campbell, ''Selected Poems'', [[Henry Regnery Company]], 1955. Page 283. "On the Martyrdom of F. Garcia Lorca."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Memorials==
[[File:Federico Garcia Lorca - De profundis - Langebrug, Leiden.JPG|thumb|The poem ''De profundis'' in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], the last of a set of 101 [[Wall poems in Leiden]] to be painted.]]
In Granada, the city of his birth, the [[Park Federico García Lorca|Parque Federico García Lorca]] is dedicated to his memory and includes the Huerta de San Vicente, the Lorca family summer home, opened as a museum in 1995. The grounds, including nearly two hectares of land, the two adjoining houses, works of art, and the original furnishings have been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huertadesanvicente.com |title=Huertadesanvicente.com |publisher=Huertadesanvicente.com |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a new{{when|date=March 2016}} statue of Lorca on the Avenida de la Constitución in the city center, and a new cultural center bearing his name is currently{{when|date=March 2016}} under construction and will play a major role in preserving and disseminating his works.

The Parque Federico García Lorca, in Alfacar, is near Fuente Grande; in 2009 excavations in it failed to locate Lorca's body. Close to the olive tree indicated by some as marking the location of the grave, there is a stone memorial to Federico García Lorca and all other victims of the Civil War, 1936–39. Flowers are laid at the memorial every year on the anniversary of his death, and a commemorative event including music and readings of the poet's works is held every year in the park to mark the anniversary. On 17 August 2011, to remember the 75th anniversary of Lorca's assassination and to celebrate his life and legacy, this event included dance, song, poetry and dramatic readings and attracted hundreds of spectators.

At the Barranco de Viznar, between Viznar and Alfacar, there is a memorial stone bearing the words "Lorca eran todos, 18-8-2002" ("All were Lorca"). The Barranco de Viznar is the site of mass graves and has been proposed as another possible location of the poet's remains.

García Lorca is honored by a statue prominently located in [[Madrid]]'s [[Plaza de Santa Ana]]. Political philosopher David Crocker reports that "the statue, at least, is still an emblem of the contested past: each day, the Left puts a red kerchief on the neck of the statue, and someone from the Right comes later to take it off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/articles_papers_reports/957.html|title=Democratic Development and Reckoning with the Past: The Case of Spain in Comparative Context|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fundación Federico García Lorca, directed by Lorca's niece Laura García Lorca, sponsors the celebration and dissemination of the writer's work and is currently{{when|date=March 2016}} building the Centro Federico García Lorca in [[Madrid]]. The Lorca family deposited all Federico documents with the foundation, which holds them on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garcia-lorca.org/Home/Idioma.aspx |title=The Lorca Foundation |publisher=Garcia-lorca.org |accessdate=14 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718184329/http://www.garcia-lorca.org/Home/Idioma.aspx |archivedate=18 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Hotel Castelar in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where Lorca lived for six months in 1933, the room where he lived has been kept as a shrine and contains original writings and drawings of his.

[[File:Bianca Beauchamp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bianca Beauchamp]] modelling a latex corset]]

A '''fetish model''' is a [[Model (person)|model]] who models [[fetish clothing]] or devices that augment his or her body in a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]-like manner or in fetishistic situations, though he or she may not work exclusively in that form of modeling.

Many fetish models display what are termed [[fetish fashion]]s, which are clothing styles that considered extreme and provocative, designed to elicit a strong emotional reaction or desire on the part of the observer.  Such clothing range from exotic stylized bathing suits to extreme costuming including [[body armor]] and [[sci-fi]] fantasy suits.

Fetish modeling may involve [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[body modification]], [[fetish photography]] and exotic [[glamour photography]] as well as [[sexual fantasy]] costuming (i.e. maid's outfits, nurses, etc.). Fetish models may model for photography, and appear at [[BDSM]] fairs and parties.

Several [[pornographic actor]]s and [[glamour model]]s also act as fetish models.

==Types of fetish models==
[[File:Model preparing for Suspension Bondage.png|thumb|left|A model prepares for a [[suspension bondage]] scene]]

Fetish modelling covers a wide range of fetishes, including those involving [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[Latex and PVC fetishism|latex]], [[Bondage corset|corset]]s, even [[wedgie]]s, [[tattoo]]/[[body piercing]], [[Shoe fetishism|shoe]]s, thin fetishism, [[Japanese bondage|shibari]], and [[Nyotaimori]] / [[food]]. Fetishes may also involve body parts, such as [[breast fetish|breasts]], [[navel fetish|navel]], [[Foot fetishism|feet]], and so on.

Fetish models are usually considered to be in a different category to [[Gothic fashion|gothic]] or alternative models, who are usually far more niche specific.  Fetish models may only involve themselves in the overall [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] aspects rather than work directly with sex and sexuality.  Fetish modelling is usually considered to be a part of the [[Sex industry|adult industry]] due to its popular perception as an "adult only" appreciation.  However, in recent times, many aspects of the fetish fashion market have been incorporated and accepted into mainstream fashion whereby fashion creators will directly use exotic fabrics such as latex or sheer instead of cotton or wool for their creations.

==Popular culture==
[[File:Bettie_Page_in_Bizarre_Magazine.jpg|thumb|Bettie Page is tied and spanked in an image from ''[[John Willie|Bizarre]]''.]]
There have been several notable performers and producers of both the bondage and fetish area who have attained mainstream notability.  The most recognized is the 1950s bondage model and [[pin-up girl]], [[Bettie Page]] who posed for photographer [[Irving Klaw]] for mail-order photographs and was subsequently featured in [[Playboy]].
&lt;ref name=Essex&gt;Essex, Karen, and James L. Swanson, ''Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend.'' Los Angeles: General Publishing Group, 1996. {{ISBN|1-881649-62-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foster&gt;Foster, Richard, ''The Real Bettie Page: The Truth About the Queen of the Pinups.'' Secaucus, N.J.: Carol Publishing Group/Birch Lane Press, 1997. {{ISBN|1-55972-432-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s the popular [[United Kingdom|British]] TV program, ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' incorporated much fetish costuming for their lead female performers including [[Diana Rigg]]'s famous leather [[catsuit]]s and [[leotard]]s as well as [[Tara King]]'s continual [[thigh-length boots]] and shoulder length leather gloves.

==Markets==
There are specialized publications that feature and promote fetish models, including ''[[Skin Two]]'', ''Secret'', Italian ''A Magazine'' (not to be confused with the now defunct ''A(sian) Magazine''), and ''[[Marquis (magazine)|Marquis]]''.

Fetish models may run personal adult pay websites and are featured on fetish adult pay sites.

There are also fetish [[fashion designer]]s. Most of these designers employ fetish models for their clothing line. Fetish fashion shows are hosted several times a year, including Vex, The Baroness, Skintwo, and House of Harlot.

==Awards==
The SIGNY awards were awarded each year between 2000 and 2005 (except 2002) to the bondage models voted as the best of that year. The SIGNY award winners have been:

* 2000: Eve Ellis, runners up Ashley Renee, Andrea Neal

'''Film Booking Offices of America''' ('''FBO'''), also known as '''FBO Pictures Corporation''',&lt;ref&gt;Many sources give FBO's full name incorrectly as "Film Booking Office of America"; the proper name is Film Booking Offices of America, as per the company's official logo. For the correct spelling. See Sherwood (1923), pp.&amp;nbsp;150, 156, 158, 159, etc.; Ellis and Thornborough (1923), p.&amp;nbsp;262.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American film studio of the [[Silent film|silent era]], a producer and distributor of mostly low-budget films. It was founded in 1920 as '''Robertson–Cole''' (U.S.), the American division of a [[United Kingdom|British]] import–export company formed by the English-born Harry F. Robertson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Screen; Again the import tax|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C13FF3F551A738DDDAD0894D1405B818EF1D3|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson-Cole bought the Hallmark Exchanges (formerly the [[Mutual Film|Mutual Exchanges]] that became known as Exhibitors-Mutual Exchanges) from Frank G. Hall in 1920. Exhibitors-Mutual/Hallmark had distributed Robertson-Cole product, and acquiring the exchanges gave them the right to distribute their own films plus Hall's product, with the exception of [[Charlie Chaplin]] reissues which he had the rights to.&lt;ref name="Robertson-Cole Buys"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robertson-Cole Buys|url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2015/Variety/Variety%201920/Variety%201920%20-%200361.pdf|publisher=Variety|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson-Cole initiated movie production in the United States in 1920. That year, it incorporated Robertson-Cole Studios, Inc. and bought 460 acres in [[Pacific Palisades, California]] to establish a studio. The property, which became known as the "R.C. Ranch", enabled Robertson-Cole to centralize movie production, which previously had been scattered. The movie company had relied on equipment rentals to produce motion pictures.&lt;ref name="Robertson-Cole Buys a Ranch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inceville: Robertson-Cole Buys a Ranch; Purchases 460 Acres of Land in Pacific Palisades , Cal.|url=http://www.movielocationsplus.com/INCE.HTM|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, a corporate reorganization led to the company's new name, with FBO becoming the official name of the distributing operation and Robertson-Cole Pictures Corp. the name of the production operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Studios Directory - R |url=http://www.learnaboutmovieposters.com/newsite/global/ssd/SSD-R.asp |publisher=Learn About Movie Posters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111194042/http://www.learnaboutmovieposters.com/newsite/global/ssd/SSD-R.asp |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1923, the studio contracted with [[Western (genre)|Western]] actor [[Fred Thomson]], who would soon emerge as one of [[Cinema of the United States#Rise of Hollywood|Hollywood's]] most popular stars. Thomson was just one of numerous screen cowboys with whom FBO became identified.

The studio, whose core market was America's small towns, also put out many romantic melodramas, non-Western action pictures, and comedic [[short subject|shorts]]. In 1926, financier [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] led a group that acquired the company. In June 1928, using [[RCA Photophone]] technology, FBO became only the second Hollywood studio to release a [[feature film|feature]]-length "[[sound film|talkie]]." A few months later, when Kennedy and [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] chief [[David Sarnoff]] arranged the merger that created [[RKO]], FBO was included in the new company.

==Business history==
===Foundation and identity===
[[File:FBOlogo1924.jpg|thumb|200px|left|FBO logo from 1924–25]]
The company that would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie subsidiary of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French [[Pathé Exchange]] company, a subsidiary of the French [[Pathé Frères]] company. From its U.S. headquarters in New York City, R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the [[Mutual Film]] studio.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1987) describes Robertson-Cole as an "American motion picture firm" (p. 341), which was functionally true after a certain point, but Jewell (1982) makes clear that the company was founded in Britain and that its American operations were run by Britishmen through 1922 (p. 8). As Goodwin and Jewell concur, majority ownership of FBO remained in British hands until 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of R-C's own [[feature film|feature productions]] to be released was ''The Wonder Man'', directed by [[John G. Adolfi]] and starring [[Georges Carpentier]], which debuted May 29, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the film, see the anonymous ''New York Times'' review, May 30, 1920 (available [http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9803EEDC143AEE32A25753C3A9639C946195D6CF online]).&lt;/ref&gt; With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California#Motion picture industry|Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;The studio's address was and remains 780 Gower Street. See Finler (1988), p. 12, for a map showing the FBO studio (later owned by RKO, [[Desilu]], and now [[CBS Paramount Television]]) in relation to the other main Hollywood production facilities. Finler misidentifies Melrose Ave., which runs east-west along the south of the studio, as "Beverly Boulevard." Gower St. runs north-south along the studio's western side.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons (1974), p. 90 n. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, ''[[The Mistress of Shenstone]]'', directed by [[Henry King (director)|Henry King]] and starring beautiful [[Pauline Frederick]], a former [[Famous Players-Lasky|Paramount]] and [[Goldwyn Pictures|Goldwyn]] star.&lt;ref&gt;For descriptions of the film, see the reviews in ''Moving Picture World'' (March 5, 1921) and ''Variety'' (March 18, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with [[Joseph P. Kennedy]], father of future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York banking firm of [[Hayden, Stone &amp; Co.|Hayden, Stone]], as well as the owner of Maine–New Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1987), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.

In 1922, Robertson-Cole underwent a major reorganization as the company's founders departed, though the corporation remained under majority British ownership. The flagship U.S. distribution business changed its name to Film Booking Offices of America, a banner under which R-C had released more than a dozen independent productions. The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson-Cole name for some time, but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of the business for production as well as distribution.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., "F.B.O. Announces" (1925) for evidence that the studio was primarily identified as FBO by no later than summer 1925. Though Robertson-Cole apparently remained the primary production brand for a period after the 1922 reorganization, Lasky (1989, p. 13) and Jewell (1982, p. 8) both indicate that the entire film business was incorporated that year as Film Booking Offices of America Inc. Beauchamp (1998) refers to Kennedy's 1926 takeover of "R-C Pictures Corporation and Film Booking Office of America" (p. 180). These various references suggest that, from 1922 forward, R-C (or Robertson-Cole) Pictures Corp. was the legal name of FBO (or Film Booking Offices of America) Inc.'s studio subsidiary. Logos from 1927 and 1928 (the latter pictured in the article) reading "FBO Pictures Corp." suggest that the corporate name of the studio operation was changed after the Kennedy purchase.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923, one of the company's new American investors, [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]], was effectively in command. Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company, part of the multiple merger that created the large [[Universal Studios|Universal]] studio in 1912. Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson-Cole/FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period, though there is no record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 13; Jewell (1982), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the studio launched a series of boxing-themed [[Short subject|shorts]], ''Fighting Blood'', starring [[George O'Hara (actor)|George O'Hara]]. He would become an FBO mainstay, often paired with [[Alberta Vaughn]], in such comedy series as ''The Pacemakers'' (1925). Most of O'Hara's and Vaughn's films for the studio were two-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes.
[[File:TelephoneGirlCh10.jpg|thumb|225px|''Love and Learn'' (1924) was the tenth installment of ''The Telephone Girl'', a series of [[short subject|shorts]] starring [[Alberta Vaughn]]. This was not a [[movie serial|serial]] in the classic sense, as each "chapter" was a stand-alone tale.]]
Now a fully independent businessman, Joseph Kennedy joined the FBO board of directors in 1923, as well. By this time, the studio was owned by Graham's of London, a banking firm, and Powers was succeeded by H.C.S. Thomson, a Graham's operative.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving the board the following year, Kennedy put together a major distribution and production deal between FBO and leading [[Western (genre)|Western]] star [[Fred Thomson]].&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (1998), pp. 157–58.

Kennedy (#136)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904080604/http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Archives+and+Manuscripts/Kennedy.Joseph+P/fa_kennedy_joseph_short.htm |date=2006-09-04 }} descriptive summary of material from the inventory of the late president's papers; refer to "Biographical Note." Retrieved May 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; B. P. Fineman became the studio's production chief in 1924; [[Evelyn Brent]], his wife, moved over from [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]] to become FBO's top dramatic star.&lt;ref name="Jewell"&gt;Jewell (1982), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1925, FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer signed Thomson to a new contract paying him $10,000 a week (equivalent to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1925|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). Thomson was now the highest paid of all cowboy actors, surpassing even the renowned [[Tom Mix]]. The deal also gave Thomson his own independent production unit at the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (1998), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a distributor, FBO's roster of films was about half independent and foreign productions, half its own studio output. At the height of its activity (1923–28), it released an average of around 110 features and shorts a year, focusing on distribution to small-town exhibitors and independent theater chains (that is, those not owned by one of the [[Major film studio#The majors before the Golden Age|major Hollywood studios]]).&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (1998), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; As a production company, Film Booking Offices concentrated on low-budget movies, with an emphasis on Westerns, romantic melodramas, and comedy shorts. From its first productions in early 1920 through late 1928, when it was dissolved in a merger, the company produced approximately 400 films under the brand of either Robertson-Cole Pictures or FBO Pictures. Between 1924 and 1926, several higher-end productions were made under the rubric of Gothic Pictures. The studio's top-of-the-line movies, aimed at major exhibition venues beyond the reach of most FBO films, were sometimes marketed as FBO "Gold Bond" pictures.&lt;ref&gt;"F.B.O. Announces" (1925).&lt;/ref&gt; Without the backing of large corporate interests, nor the security of its own theater chain, the company faced cash-flow difficulties during its earlier years. Short-term loans at high interest rates posed a significant financial drain.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), pp. 12–13, 14–15; Beauchamp (1998), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kennedy takes command===
[[File:FBOlogo1926.jpg|thumb|175px|left|FBO distribution logo from 1926]]
While still at Hayden, Stone, Kennedy had boasted to a colleague, "Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making themselves millionaires. I could take the whole business away from them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, he set out to do so, forming his own group of investors led by wealthy Boston lawyer Guy Currier and including [[Filene's]] department store owner Louis Kirstein and [[Union Stockyards]] and [[Armour and Company]] owner [[Frederick H. Prince]]. In August 1925, Kennedy traveled to England with an offer to buy a controlling stake in Film Booking Offices for $1 million. The bid was initially rejected, but in February 1926, FBO's owners decided to take the money.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1987), pp. 342, 343; Beauchamp (1998), p. 180; Lasky (1989), p. 13. Crafton (1997) writes that the business Joseph Kennedy purchased in February 1926 was "a small Hollywood studio, Robertson-Cole, and its New York distributor, Film Booking Office (FBO)" (p. 136). This is potentially misleading, even aside from the misspelling of FBO's name; the available evidence demonstrates that Film Booking Offices was already the studio operation's primary identity, even though it might still have been registered as R-C Pictures Corporation or some variation thereof. Crafton's nomenclature is belied by his own earlier listing of the significant U.S. film production companies of the mid-1920s, among which he names "Film Booking Office (FBO)," not Robertson–Cole (p. 68).&lt;/ref&gt; In short order, Kennedy moved his family from Massachusetts to New York City to focus on running his new business. He swiftly addressed the company's perennial cash-flow problems, arranging lines of credit and issuing stock in a business division he established, the Cinema Credit Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), pp. 14–15; Goodwin (1987), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; By March, he was traveling to Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1987), pp. 345, 346.&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association]], [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]], was delighted by the new face on the scene—in Hays's eyes, Kennedy signified both a desirable image for the industry and [[Wall Street#Cultural influence|Wall Street's]] faith in its prospects. Hays heralded Kennedy as "exceedingly American" (historian [[Cari Beauchamp]] explains the connotation: "not Jewish," in contrast to most of the studio heads), while celebrating Kennedy's "background of lofty and conservative financial connections, an atmosphere of much home and family life and all those fireside virtues of which the public never hears in the current news from Hollywood."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Beauchamp (1998), p. 180. See also p. 197; Lasky (1989), p. 14. For Hays and Kennedy's earlier association, see Goodwin (1987), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FredThomsonFBO.jpg|thumb|225px|Publicity photo of [[Fred Thomson]], FBO's biggest box-office draw during the mid-1920s]]
Fineman and Brent both departed FBO around the time of the purchase. Kennedy appointed Edwin King as the studio's production chief, but the new owner took a personal hand in guiding the company creatively as well as financially.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 15. Crafton (1997) misleadingly implies that Kennedy immediately installed William LeBaron as production chief after his takeover of FBO (p. 136). In fact, as Jewell (1982) describes, King was the first head of production named by Kennedy, with LeBaron assuming the job in 1927 (p. 9).&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy soon brought stability to FBO, making it one of the most reliably profitable outfits in the minor leagues of the Hollywood [[studio system]]. Westerns remained the studio's backbone, along with various action pictures and romantic scenarios; as Kennedy put it, "Melodrama is our meat."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Goodwin (1987), p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the average production cost of FBO features was around $50,000, and few were budgeted at anything more than $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1987), p. 348; Jewell (1982), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, in 1927–28 the average cost at Fox was $190,000; at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], $275,000.&lt;ref&gt;Finler (1988), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; One major expense was taken on directly by Kennedy: with several studios competing for Fred Thomson, Kennedy signed him to a personal contract for $15,000 a week. This was the highest straight salary for any actor in the industry, matched only by Tom Mix's new arrangement with Fox.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (1998), pp. 210, 211; Koszarski (1990), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the contract, Kennedy struck a deal in early 1927 with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the major studio to produce and distribute a series of four Thomson "super westerns." Kennedy participated in the films' financing (and profits) and the actor's company stayed on the FBO lot. Of the four Thomson features that reached theaters in 1927, three were FBO releases.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (1998), pp. 211, 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound enters the picture===
[[File:FBOlogo1928.jpg|thumb|200px|left|FBO logo from 1928]]
The advent of [[sound film]] would drastically alter the studio's course: Negotiations that began in late 1927 with the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) on a deal for sound conversion led to RCA purchasing a major interest in FBO in January 1928. Four months later, as part of a strategy conceived with RCA head [[David Sarnoff]], Kennedy acquired control of [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] (KAO), a vaudeville exhibition chain with approximately one hundred theaters across the United States, and with the [[Pathé Exchange]] and [[Cecil B. De Mille]]'s [[Producers Distributing Corporation]] under its control.&lt;ref&gt;"Cinemerger" (1927); Lasky (1989), pp. 24–26. Note that the statement in Jewell (1982) referring to "the 700 K-A-O Theatres in the US and Canada" (p. 10) is wildly inaccurate and may well be a typo. Lasky (1989) says "several hundred theaters" (p. 25), Beauchamp (1998), citing Lasky, says "three hundred theaters" (quote: p. 228, cite: p. 414 n. 41)—figures belied by ''Time'' magazine's contemporary data (see "Cinemerger").&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 1928, FBO's ''The Perfect Crime'', directed by [[Bert Glennon]] and starring [[Clive Brook]] and [[Irene Rich]], debuted.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the film, see the anonymous ''New York Times'' review, August 6, 1928 (available [http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9D02E1DA163EE73ABC4E53DFBE668383639EDE online]). According to Crafton (1997), ''The Perfect Crime'' "premiered June 17, 1928 and opened at the Rivoli on August 4" (p. 140).&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first feature-length "[[Sound film#Triumph of the .22talkies.22|talkie]]" to appear from a studio other than [[Warner Bros.]] since the epochal premiere of Warners' ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' eight months before. ''The Perfect Crime'', which went into general release on August 4, had been shot silently. Using the [[RCA Photophone]] sound-on-film system, the dialogue was [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] in afterward—a process then known as "synthetic sound."&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1997), pp. 140, 304.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, Kennedy signed a contract with RCA for live Photophone recording; more importantly, he also tendered the company an option to buy his governing share of FBO. Two months later, RCA had acquired controlling stock interests in both the studio and KAO.

On October 23, 1928, RCA announced it was merging Film Booking Offices and Keith-Albee-Orpheum to form the new motion picture business [[RKO Pictures|Radio-Keith-Orpheum]] (RKO), with Sarnoff as chairman.&lt;ref&gt;While all other latter-day published sources give October as the date of the merger, Crafton (1997) states, "The new holding company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum, was formed on 21 November 1928" (p. 142).&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy, who retained Pathé, was paid $150,000 for arranging the merger on top of the millions of dollars in profit he made from selling off his stock.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph I. Schnitzer, ranking FBO vice-president, was elevated to president of the new company's production arm, replacing Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; William LeBaron, the last FBO production chief, retained his position after the merger, but the new studio, dedicated to full sound production, cut ties with most of FBO's roster of silent-screen performers. Movies that Film Booking Offices had either produced or arranged to distribute were released under the FBO banner through the end of 1929. The last official FBO production to reach American theaters was ''Pals of the Prairie'', directed by Louis King and starring Buzz Barton and Frank Rice, released July 1, 1929.

==Cinematic legacy==
===Headliners and celebrity casting===
[[File:EvelynBrent1.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Publicity photo of [[Evelyn Brent]], star of 14 FBO films between 1924 and 1926]]
The vast majority of FBO/Robertson-Cole pictures, produced during either the silent era or the transitional period of the conversion to sound cinema, are considered to be [[lost film]]s, with no copies now known to exist. Partly in consequence, many of FBO's star actors are barely remembered today.

[[Pauline Frederick]] was the major headliner of the early R-C days, and [[Evelyn Brent]] was FBO's most prized non-Western star.&lt;ref name="Jewell"/&gt; [[Warner Baxter]], [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]], and young [[Frankie Darro]] were among the other prominent FBO players. [[Anna Q. Nilsson]] starred in two of the studio's larger productions, as did [[Olive Borden]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]] FBO's leading star of action and mystery pictures was [[Richard Talmadge]]. He appeared in eighteen FBO releases, more than half of them produced by his own company. [[Maurice Bennett Flynn|Maurice "Lefty" Flynn]] starred in over a dozen FBO action films, all directed by [[Harry Garson]], who also ran his own production business.&lt;ref&gt;For more on Flynn, see Christgau (1999), pp. 55–59.&lt;/ref&gt; From the studio's pre-Hollywood days in 1920 through 1928, [[Ralph Lewis (actor)|Ralph Lewis]] starred in more than ten R-C and FBO pictures of various genres. Former model [[Reed Howes]], renowned as an "[[The Arrow Collar Man|Arrow Collar Man]]", made his acting debut with FBO after an extensive publicity campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Corneau (1969), p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its earlier years, the studio did not hesitate to take advantage of scandal sheet–worthy events. After the death of celebrated ''Paramount'' actor [[Wallace Reid]], brought on by morphine addiction, his widow, [[Dorothy Davenport]], signed on as producer and star of a cinematic examination of the sins of substance abuse: ''[[Human Wreckage]]'', released by FBO in June 1923, five months after Reid's death, featured Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as the wife of a noble attorney turned dope fiend.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer (1999), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the biggest movie star in the world, [[Rudolph Valentino]], split from his wife, [[Natacha Rambova]], she was swiftly enlisted by the studio to costar with Clive Brook in the sensitively titled ''When Love Grows Cold'' (1926).&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1987), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Kennedy's control, studio production shifted away from provocative fare in an attempt to brand the studio's films as suitable for the "average American" and the entire family: "We can't make pictures and label them 'For Children,' or 'For Women' or 'For Stout People' or 'For Thin Ones.' We must make pictures that have appeal to all."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Goodwin (1987), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Kennedy ended the scandal-sheet specials, FBO still found occasion for celebrity casting: ''One Minute to Play'' (1926), directed by [[Sam Wood]], marks the film debut of football great [[Red Grange|"Red" Grange]].&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1926). See also ''Heritage Vintage'' (2004b), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western stars===
[[File:CowboyCopPoster.jpg|thumb|275px|''[[The Cowboy Cop]]'' (1926) was headlined by [[Tom Tyler]]. The most prolific of FBO's many Western stars, Tyler appeared in 29 movies for the studio.]]
Central to the FBO identity were Westerns and the studio's major cowboy star, [[Fred Thomson]]. In both 1926 and 1927, he ranked number two in the ''Exhibitors' Herald'' survey of the "Top Stars of the Year," right behind [[Tom Mix]].&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp (1998), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; With Thomson's personal contract with Kennedy due to expired in mid-1927,&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 17; Beauchamp (1998), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy—sending that Thomson had reached the peak of his popularity and seeing a financial opportunity for FBO—arranged a four-picture deal with [[Paramount Pictures]], one of the major Hollywood studio. The deal essentially ceded Thomson to the rival studio. For FBO's guarantee of $75,000 in financing per picture, Thomson would star in Paramount productions. In return, Paramount would return the $75,000 in financing plus an additional $100,000 to FBO and pay Thomson's $15,000 a week salary.&lt;ref name="Kennedy  His Hollywood Years"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beauchamp|first=Cari|title=Joseph P. Kennedy Presents: His Hollywood Years|year=2010|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-1400040001|pages=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Kennedy replaced Thomson by signing Tom Mix, whose contract with [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox's]] [[Fox Film Corporation]] had expired. Mix played hard-to-get, threatening to move to [[Argentina]] to make films or joining the circus, but eventually, he signed with FBO but eventually left for [[Universal Studios|Universal]] due to salary disputes with the studio. He said of Kennedy that he was a "tight-assed, money-crazed son-of-a-bitch".&lt;ref name="The Kennedys in Hollywood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quirk|first=Lawrence J.|title=The Kennedys in Hollywood|year=1996|publisher=Taylor Publications|isbn=978-0878339341|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBO's second-biggest long-running Western star was [[Tom Tyler]]. According to a June 1927 report in ''Moving Picture World'':&lt;blockquote&gt;With Tom Tyler rapidly taking the place recently vacated by Fred Thomson, F.B.O.'s program of western pictures is taking a place second to none in the industry.... Tyler has made rapid strides during his two years with F.B.O. and with his horse 'Flash' and dog 'Beans' has become one of the leading favorites on the screen.&lt;ref&gt;''Moving Picture World'', June 11, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to these three big names there was also [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], still a major star when he made several films for the studio in 1922–23. The other cowboy stars of FBO included [[Bob Custer]], Bob Steele, and teenager Buzz Barton.

===Canine stars===
One of the studio's most reliable Western headliners was a dog: Ranger.&lt;ref&gt;The suggestion by Goodwin (1987) that, during Kennedy's tenure, FBO made "a dozen dog pictures...each year" (p. 348) is exaggerated. Ranger, the studio's only canine headliner of the Kennedy era, starred in sixteen pictures over the course of three years. From before the Kennedy era through 1928, Beans had featured roles in a number of Tom Tyler/Frankie Darro Westerns. For examples of how such films were marketed, see ''Heritage Vintage'' (2004a), p. 79, and ''Heritage Vintage'' (2005), p. 35. In the latter, note that the text accompanying the reproduced poster of ''Tom and His Pals'' (1926) incorrectly identifies the film as a Paramount picture; note also that, despite what the text implies, this was not the first film teaming Tyler and Darro.&lt;/ref&gt; The fabled [[Strongheart]] starred in FBO's ''White Fang'' (1925), and [[Rin Tin Tin]] had one of his earliest roles in ''My Dad'' (1922).&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the former, see Sandburg (1925), pp. 270–271. For a description of the latter, see Janiss Garza, [http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=103309 "''My Dad''"] ''Allmovie'' review; part of ''New York Times'' website. Retrieved May 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short subjects and animation===
FBO's many shorts—the popular George O'Hara and Alberta Vaughn series, and scores of others—are largely forgotten. Of particular historical interest are two independently produced series of [[slapstick]] comedies with important performers: FBO put out several shorts in 1924–25 made by [[Joe Rock]] and starring [[Stan Laurel]], before his famous partnership with [[Oliver Hardy]]. In 1926–27, the company distributed more than a dozen shorts by innovative comedian/animator [[Charles Bowers]].&lt;ref&gt;For more on Bowers' work with FBO, see Crafton (1993), p. 362 n. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the work of Charles Bowers, FBO was a distributor of other significant animated films. Between 1924 and 1926, FBO released the work of [[John Randolph Bray]]'s cartoon studio, including the ''[[Dinky Doodle]]'' series created by [[Walter Lantz]].&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1993), pp. 186, 187; Langer (1995), pp. 105, 259 n. 40. For posters of two Bray/Lantz cartoons distributed by FBO, see ''Heritage Vintage'' (2004b), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1925 to 1927, the studio put out approximately three dozen animated adaptations of [[George Herriman]] newspaper comics directed by William Nolan, featuring characters from Herriman's famed ''[[Krazy Kat]]'' strip. FBO picked up the ''Krazy Kat'' cartoons from the distribution team of [[Margaret J. Winkler|Margaret Winkler]] and her husband, [[Charles B. Mintz|Charles Mintz]]. In 1926, FBO struck a deal with the Winkler–Mintz operation for another series, one that, like Bowers' shorts, involved both animation and a live performer: the ''[[Alice Comedies]]'', of which FBO would put out over two dozen, were created by two young animators, [[Ub Iwerks]] and [[Walt Disney]].&lt;ref&gt;Crafton (1993), p. 285; Langer (1995), p. 259 n. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable films and filmmakers===
[[File:TarzanGoldenLion.jpg|thumb|275px|left|[[James Pierce]] in FBO's ''[[Tarzan and the Golden Lion (film)|Tarzan and the Golden Lion]]'' (1927), which brought the famous character back to the big screen for the first time in six years. [[Tarzan]] would remain a Hollywood fixture for the next four decades.]]
Kennedy had no illusions about his studio's place in the realm of cinematic art. A journalist once complimented him on FBO's recent output: "You have had some good pictures this year." Kennedy jocularly inquired, "What the hell ''were'' they?"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In her history of RKO, author Betty Lasky points to the pre-Kennedy ''[[Broken Laws]]'' (1924), directed by [[Roy William Neill]] and starring Dorothy Davenport (again billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid) as exemplifying the rare "unforgettable picture of the higher caliber" put out by FBO.&lt;ref&gt;Lasky (1989), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the studio's action movies, one standout production was a 1927 [[Tarzan]] picture. Author [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] declared, "If you want to see the personification of Tarzan of the Apes as I visualize him, see the film ''[[Tarzan and the Golden Lion (film)|Tarzan and the Golden Lion]]'' with Mr. [[James Pierce]]."&lt;ref name="Quoted"&gt;Quoted in Fenton (2002), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Film Daily]]'' reviewer wrote that the movie "has a rather new order of thrills and atmosphere that might prove distinctly attractive."&lt;ref name="Quoted"/&gt; The [[short subject|two-reeler]] ''West of Hot Dog'' (1924), according to historian Simon Louvish, contains "one of Stan [Laurel]'s finest gags," involving a level of cinematic technique that bears comparison to [[Buster Keaton]]'s classic ''[[Sherlock, Jr.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Louvish (2001), pp. 171–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the studio's most impressive releases were foreign productions. In 1927, FBO picked up for U.S. distribution a celebrated Austrian biblical spectacular made three years earlier: ''[[Die Sklavenkönigin]]'' (''The Slave Queen'', aka ''Moon of Israel'') had already won its director, Michael Kertész, a job with Warner Bros.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp (1987), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hollywood, he would change his name to [[Michael Curtiz]]. ''Una Nueva y gloriosa nación'' (1928), the most successful film in the history of Argentine silent cinema, was shot in Hollywood and distributed in the United States by FBO as ''[[The Charge of the Gauchos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Finkielman (2004), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LadyRobinHood.jpg|thumb|275px|A masked Brent in the title role of ''Lady Robin Hood'' (1925), directed by Ralph Ince.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the film, see Buehrer (1993), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Her cowering foe is played by [[Boris Karloff]], who appeared in six FBO pictures between 1925 and 1927.]]
One of the two [[cinematography|cinematographers]] of ''[[Una Nueva y gloriosa nación]]'' was [[Nicholas Musuraca]], who established his career at Film Booking Offices. With RKO, Musuraca would become one of Hollywood's most respected cinematographers.

Among FBO's other offscreen talent, the best known director to work regularly at the studio was [[Ralph Ince]], younger brother of famous filmmaker [[Thomas H. Ince]]. Pulling double duty on occasion, Ralph Ince starred in four of the fourteen films he made for FBO. One production in which Ince served in both capacities was particularly well received: ''[[Chicago After Midnight]]'' (1928) was described by the ''New York Times'' as "[a]n unusually well-acted and adroitly directed underworld story."&lt;ref&gt;Hall (1928).&lt;/ref&gt; After ''[[The Mistress of Shenstone]]'', Henry King directed two more R-C films with Pauline Frederick, also in 1921: ''Salvage'' and ''The Sting of the Lash''.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of the former, see the review in ''Variety'', June 17, 1921. For descriptions of the latter, see the reviews in ''Harrison's Reports'' (October 1, 1921) and ''Variety'' (October 21, 1921).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tod Browning]] directed two Gothic Pictures specials in 1924 starring Evelyn Brent: ''The Dangerous Flirt'' and ''Silk Stocking Sal''.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief description of the former, see Sullivan (1986), p. 60. For a description of the latter, see Langman (1998), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1921 to 1924, [[William Seiter]] directed a half-dozen FBO releases, some produced directly for the studio, others independently. Between 1922 and 1926, Emory Johnson produced and directed at least eight films for FBO. Historian [[William K. Everson]] has pointed to Seiter and Johnson as two of the overlooked directorial talents of the silent era.&lt;ref&gt;Everson (1998), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Frances Marion]], who would win two [[Academy Award|Oscars]] in the 1930s, penned ten of the FBO pictures starring her husband, [[Fred Thomson]]. [[Film editing|Editor]] [[Pandro S. Berman]], son of a major FBO stockholder, cut his first film for the studio at the age of twenty-two; he would go on to renown as an RKO producer and production chief. Famed RKO [[costume designer]] [[Walter Plunkett]] was also an FBO graduate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13154">The '''Geer tube''' was an early single-tube [[color television]] [[cathode ray tube]], developed by Willard Geer. The Geer tube used a pattern of small phosphor-covered three-sided pyramids on the inside of the CRT faceplate to mix separate red, green and blue signals from three [[electron gun]]s. The Geer tube had a number of disadvantages, and was never used commercially due to the much better images generated by [[RCA]]'s [[shadow mask]] system. Nevertheless, Geer's patent was awarded first, and RCA purchased an option on it in case their own developments didn't pan out.

==History==

===Color television===
Color television had been studied even before commercial broadcasting became common, but it was only in the late 1940s that the problem was seriously considered. At the time, a number of systems were being proposed that used separate red, green and blue signals (RGB), broadcast in succession. Most experimental systems broadcast entire frames in sequence, with a colored filter (or "[[Color gel|gel]]") that rotated in front of an otherwise conventional black and white television tube. Each frame encoded one color of the picture, and the wheel spun in sync with the signal so the correct gel was in front of the screen when that colored frame was being displayed. Because they broadcast separate signals for the different colors, all of these systems were incompatible with existing black and white sets. Another problem was that the mechanical filter made them flicker unless very high refresh rates were used.&lt;ref name=seq&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html "CBS Field Sequential Color System"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105183213/http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_CBS.html |date=January 5, 2010 }}, 24 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

RCA worked along different lines entirely, using a luminance-chrominance system. This system did not directly encode or transmit the RGB signals; instead it combined these colors into one overall brightness figure, the "[[luminance]]". Luminance closely matched the black and white signal of existing broadcasts, allowing it to be displayed on black and white televisions. This was a major advantage over the mechanical systems being proposed by other groups. Color information was then separately encoded and folded into the signal as a high-frequency modification to produce a [[composite video]] signal &amp;ndash; on a black and white television this extra information would be seen as a slight randomization of the image intensity, but the limited resolution of existing sets made this invisible in practice. On color sets the signal would be filtered out and added to the luminance to re-create the original RGB for display.

Although RCA's system had enormous benefits, it had not been successfully developed because it was difficult to produce the display tubes. Black and white TVs used a continuous signal and the tube could be coated with an even deposit of phosphor. With the luminance concept, the color was changing continually along the line, which was far too fast for any sort of mechanical filter to follow. Instead, the phosphor had to be broken down into a discrete pattern of colored spots. Focusing the right signal on each of these tiny spots was beyond the capability of electron guns of the era.&lt;ref name=rca&gt;Ed Reitan, [http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_RCA.html "RCA Dot Sequential Color System"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107142004/http://novia.net/~ereitan/Color_Sys_RCA.html |date=2010-01-07 }}, 28 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geer's solution===
Charles Willard Geer, then{{when|date=December 2017}} an assistant professor at the [[University of Southern California]], was lecturing on the mechanical methods of producing color television that were being experimented with in the 1940s, and decided that an electronically scanned system would be superior, if someone would only invent one. Mentioning it later to his wife, she replied "You'd better get busy and invent it yourself".&lt;ref name=teach&gt;''Teacher's''&lt;/ref&gt;

Geer solved the display problem with the novel application of optics. Instead of trying to focus the electron beams onto tiny spots, he instead focused them onto larger areas and used simple optics to re-combine each individual primary color at any given place on the screen into a single [[pixel]]. The tube was arranged with three separate electron guns, one each for red, green and blue (RGB), arranged around the outside of the picture area. This made a Geer tube quite large; the "necks" of the tubes normally lie behind the display area and give the TV its depth, whereas in the Geer tube the necks projected around the outside of the display area, making it much larger.&lt;ref name=p1&gt;''Color Television Device''&lt;/ref&gt;

The rear face of the screen was covered with a series of tiny triangular pyramids imprinted on an aluminum sheet, coated on the inside of each face with colored phosphor. Properly aligned, a given electron beam could only reach one face of the pyramids, striking it and traveling through the thin metal into the thicker phosphor layer inside. When all three guns hit their respective faces, the colored light was created in the interior of the pyramid where it mixed, producing a proper color display on the open base, which faced the user.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt;

One enormous advantage of the Geer system is that it could be used with any of the proposed color television broadcasting systems. [[CBS]] was promoting a "[[Field-sequential color system|field sequential]]" system at 144 frames per second that they intended to display with a mechanical color filter wheel. This same signal could be displayed on a Geer tube by sending each successive frame to a different gun, in turn. [[RCA]]'s "dot sequential" system could also be shown by de-multiplexing the signals and sending all three color signals to each of the appropriate guns at the same time. B&amp;W signals could be displayed by sending the same signal, muted by 1/3, also to all three guns at the same time.&lt;ref name=popsic/&gt;

Getting the electron beam to hit the correct pyramid, and not surrounding ones, was a major problem for the design. The beam from an electron gun is normally circular, so when it was aimed at a triangular target, some part of the beam normally went past the target pyramid and hit others on the screen. This results in ''overscan'', causing the image to be blurry and washed out. The problem was particularly difficult to solve because the angle between the beam and faces changed as the beams scanned the tube &amp;ndash; pyramids near the gun would be hit at close to a right angle, but ones at the opposite side of the tube were at an acute angle.&lt;ref name=p2&gt;''Television Color Screen''&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that each gun was offset from the CRT's main axis, it was necessary to make major geometrical corrections to the raster geometry during the scan.

===Competing systems===

Geer filed for a patent on his design on 11 July 1944.&lt;ref name=p1/&gt; [[Technicolor]] purchased the patent rights and started development of prototype units in concert with the [[Stanford Research Institute]], spending a reported $500,000 in 1950 (approx. equivalent, $4 million, in 2005) on development.&lt;ref&gt;"The Patent, Trade-mark, and Copyright Journal of Research and Education", George Washington University, spring 1960&lt;/ref&gt; The system was widely reported on at the time, including mentions in ''[[Time Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name=teach/&gt; ''[[Popular Science]]'',&lt;ref name=popsic&gt;"Tube Shows TV in Color", ''Popular Science'', March 1949, pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Rainbow on the TV Screen", ''Popular Mechanics'', January 1950, pp. 97–103&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Radio Electronics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Fred Shunaman, "Color Television Systems", ''Radio-electronics'', Volume 22, 1950, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

Many other companies were also working on color television systems, most notably [[RCA]]. They had filed a patent on their [[shadow mask]] system only a few weeks after Geer. When Geer, and Technicolor, informed RCA of their patent, RCA took out licenses and adding further funding to the project as a "second iron in the fire" in case none of their in-house developments worked out.

In head-to-head testing against other color television systems for the [[NTSC]] color standardization efforts that started in November 1949, Geer's tube did not fare particularly well. Overscan bled the colors into neighboring pixels and led to soft colors and poor color registration and contrast. This problem was by no means limited to the Geer tube; several different technologies were demonstrated at the show, and only the CBS mechanical system proved able to produce a picture that satisfied the judges. In 1950, the CBS system was adopted as the NTSC standard.&lt;ref name=seq/&gt;

Geer continued to work on the overscan problems throughout the late 1940s and into the 1950s, filing additional patents on various corrections to improve the system.&lt;ref name=p2/&gt; Other vendors were making similar strides with their own technologies, and in 1953 the NTSC reconvened a panel to consider the color issue. This time [[RCA]]'s [[shadow mask]] system quickly demonstrated itself as superior to all the other systems, including Geer's. The shadow mask remained the primary method of building color televisions, with Sony [[Trinitron]] a distant second, until the early 2000s when [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] technology replaced CRTs. At the same time, RCA's version of color encoding into a signal that was compatible with existing B&amp;W sets was also adopted, with modifications, and remained the primary U.S. television standard until 2009, when [[Digital television transition|analog television was shut down]].

===After NTSC===

Geer continued to work on his basic concept for some time, as well as other television related concepts. In 1955 he filed a patent on a flat TV tube that used a gun arranged to lie beside the image area that fired upward towards the top. The beam was deflected through 90 degrees by a series of charged wires so the beam was now traveling horizontally across the back of the picture area. A second grid, located beside the first, then bent the beams through a small angle so they hit the back of the screen.&lt;ref name=p3&gt;''Television Picture''&lt;/ref&gt;

It does not appear that this device was ever constructed, and the arrangement of aiming elements suggests focusing the image would be a serious problem. Two other inventors had been working on this problem was well, [[Dennis Gabor]] in England (better known for the development of [[hologram]]s) and William Aiken in the US. Both of their patents were filed before Geer's, and the [[Aiken tube]] was successfully built in small numbers. More recently, similar concepts were used, combined with computer controlled convergence systems, to produce "flatter" systems, typically for [[computer monitor]] use. Sony sold small-screen monochrome TVs using basically-similar nearly-flat CRTs; they were used for outside-broadcast monitors, as well. However these were quickly displaced by [[LCD]]-based systems.

In 1960 he filed for a patent on a three-dimensional television system that used two color tubes and a 2-dimensional version of his pyramids. The vertical channels reflected the light in two directions, providing different images for each eye.&lt;ref name=p4&gt;''Three-Dimensional''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Italia del nord, maschere con ornati, 1590-1610 ca..JPG|thumb|200px|Decorative panel showing the two separable elements of ''Grotesque'': the elaborate acanthus leaf and candelabra type design and the hideous mask or face]]
Since at least the 18th century (in French, German and English), '''grotesque''' (or '''grottoesque''') has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as [[Halloween]] masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, ''grotesque'' may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as [[sympathy|sympathetic]] [[pity]]. More specifically, the grotesque forms on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic buildings]], when not used as drain-spouts, should not be called [[gargoyle]]s, but rather referred to simply as grotesques, or [[Chimera (architecture)|chimeras]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridaham, Lester Burbank, introduction by Ralph Adams Cram, “Gargoyles, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture”, Architectural Book Publishing Co., Inc. New York, 1930 p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally a noun (1560s), from Italian grottesco (through Middle French), literally "of a cave", from Italian ''grotta'' (see [[grotto]]),&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grotesque |title=OED-Grotesque etymology |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an extravagant style of [[Ancient Roman art|Ancient Roman]] decorative art rediscovered and then copied in Rome at the end of the 15th century. The word first was used of paintings found on the walls of basements of Roman ruins that were called at that time ''Le Grotte'' (The Grottoes) due to their appearance. These "caves" were in fact rooms and corridors of the [[Domus Aurea]], the unfinished palace complex started by [[Nero]] after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] and [[moresque]] for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements.

Rémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, [[hybridity]] and metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;Astruc R. (2010), Le Renouveau du grotesque dans le roman du XXe siècle, Paris, Classiques Garnier.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change.{{Citation needed (lead)|date=July 2012}} &lt;!--tags removed: for citations in this summary, see main treatment below--&gt;

==History==
[[File:Domus fresco.jpg|thumb|Roman frescos in Nero's [[Domus Aurea]]]]
===Early examples in Roman ornaments===
In art, '''grotesques''' are ornamental arrangements of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s with interlaced garlands and small and fantastic human and animal figures, usually set out in a [[symmetrical]] pattern around some form of architectural framework, though this may be very flimsy. Such designs were fashionable in ancient [[Rome]], as fresco wall decoration, floor mosaics, etc., and were decried by [[Vitruvius]] (c. 30 BC), who in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the description: "reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with curly leaves and volutes take the place of pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them."

When Nero's palace in Rome, the [[Domus Aurea]], was inadvertently rediscovered in the late 15th century, buried in fifteen hundred years of fill, the first breakthrough was from above, so that those keen to see the rooms had to be lowered down into them on ropes, completing their resemblance to caves, or [[grotto]]es in Italian.  The Roman wall decorations in fresco and delicate [[stucco]] were a revelation.

===Etymology in Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca Duomo Siena-2 Apr 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ceiling of the [[Piccolomini Library]]]]
The first appearance of the word ''grottesche'' appears in a contract of 1502 for the [[Piccolomini Library]] attached to the [[duomo]] of [[Siena]]. They were introduced by [[Raphael Sanzio]] and his team of decorative painters, who developed ''grottesche'' into a complete system of ornament in the [[Loggias]] that are part of the series of [[Raphael's Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], Rome. "The decorations astonished and charmed a generation of artists that was familiar with the grammar of the [[classical orders]] but had not guessed till then that in their private houses the Romans had often disregarded those rules and had adopted instead a more fanciful and informal style that was all lightness, elegance and grace."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward-Jackson, "The Grotesque" in "Some main streams and tributaries in European ornament from 1500 to 1750: part 1" ''The Victoria and Albert Museum Bulletin'' (June 1967, pp 58-70) p 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In these grotesque decorations a tablet or candelabrum might provide a focus; frames were extended into scrolls that formed part of the surrounding designs as a kind of scaffold, as Peter Ward-Jackson noted. Light scrolling grotesques could be ordered by confining them within the framing of a pilaster to give them more structure. [[Giovanni da Udine]] took up the theme of grotesques in decorating the [[Villa Madama]], the most influential of the new Roman villas.
[[File:BLW Pilgrim Bottle, about 1560-1570.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Maiolica]] pilgrim bottle with ''grottesche'' decor, Fontana workshop, [[Urbino]], c 1560-70]]
In the 16th century, such artistic license and irrationality was controversial matter. [[Francisco de Holanda]] puts a defense in the mouth of [[Michelangelo]] in his third dialogue of ''Da Pintura Antiga'', 1548:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"this insatiable desire of man sometimes prefers to an ordinary building, with its pillars and doors, one falsely constructed in grotesque style, with pillars formed of children growing out of stalks of flowers, with [[architrave]]s and [[Cornice (architecture)|cornice]]s of branches of myrtle and doorways of reeds and other things, all seeming impossible and contrary to reason, yet it may be really great work if it is performed by a skillful artist."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in David Summers, "Michelangelo on Architecture", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''54'''.2 (June 1972:146-157) p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mannerism===
[[Image:Grotesqueengraving.jpg|thumb|250px|Grotesque engraving on paper, about 1500 - 1512, by [[Nicoletto da Modena]].]]
The delight of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists and their patrons in arcane iconographic programs available only to the erudite could be embodied in schemes of ''grottesche'',&lt;ref&gt;An example, the vaulted arcade in the Palazzo del Governatore, Assisi, which was frescoed with grotesques in 1556, has been examined in the monograph by Ezio Genovesi, ''Le grottesche della 'Volta Pinta' in Assisi'' (Assisi, 1995): Genovesi explores the role of the local Accademia del Monte.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''[[Emblemata]]'' (1522) offered ready-made iconographic shorthand for vignettes. More familiar material for grotesques could be drawn from [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Kommerell, ''Metamorphosed Margins: The Case for a Visual Rhetoric of the Renaissance 'Grottesche' under the Influence of Ovid's Metamorphoses'' (Hildesheim, 2008)..&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vatican loggias]], a [[loggia]] corridor space in the [[Apostolic Palace]] open to the elements on one side, were decorated around 1519 by [[Raphael]]s's large team of artists, with [[Giovanni da Udine]] the main hand involved.  Because of the relative unimportance of the space, and a desire to copy the Domus Aurea style, no large paintings were used, and the surfaces were mostly covered with grotesque designs on a white background, with paintings imitating sculptures in niches, and small figurative subjects in a revival of Ancient Roman style. This large array provided a repertoire of elements that were the basis for later artists across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michelangelo's [[Medici Chapel]] Giovanni da Udine composed during 1532-33 "most beautiful sprays of foliage, rosettes and other ornaments in stucco and gold" in the coffers and "sprays of foliage, birds, masks and figures", with a result that did not please [[Pope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII Medici]], however, nor [[Giorgio Vasari]], who whitewashed the grottesche decor in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;"''bellissimi fogliami, rosoni ed altri ornamenti di stuccho e d'oro''" and "''fogliami, uccelli, maschere e figure''", quoted by Summers 1972:151 and note 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Counter Reformation]] writers on the arts, notably Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], bishop of Bologna,&lt;ref&gt;Paleotti, ''Discorso intorno alle imagini sacre e profane'' (printed at Bologna, 1582)&lt;/ref&gt; turned upon ''grottesche'' with a righteous vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Summers 1972:152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane's legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter's imagination, the higher he was rated".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vasari recorded that [[Francesco Bacchiacca|Francesco Ubertini, called "Bacchiacca"]], delighted in inventing ''grotteschi'', and (about 1545) painted for Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo de' Medici]] a ''[[studiolo]]'' in a mezzanine at the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] "full of animals and rare plants".&lt;ref&gt;"Dilettossi il Bacchiacca di far grottesche; onde al Sig. duca Cosimo fece uno studiolo pieno d'animali e d'erbe rare ritratte dalle naturali, che sono tenute bellissime": quoted in Francesco Vossilla, "Cosimo I, lo scrittoio del Bachiacca, una carcassa di capodoglio e la filosofia naturale", ''Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz'', '''37.'''.2/3 (1993:381-395) p. 383; only fragments survive of the decor.&lt;/ref&gt; Other 16th-century writers on ''grottesche'' included [[Daniele Barbaro]], [[Pirro Ligorio]] and [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]].&lt;ref&gt;All mentioned by Ezio Genovesi 1995, in providing explanation of the genre in the context of the painted vaulting at Assisi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engravings, woodwork, book illustration, decorations===
In the meantime, through the medium of [[engraving]]s the grotesque mode of surface ornament passed into the European artistic repertory of the 16th century, from Spain to Poland. A classic suite was that attributed to [[Enea Vico]], published in 1540-41 under an evocative explanatory title, ''Leviores et extemporaneae picturae quas grotteschas vulgo vocant'', "Light and extemporaneous pictures that are vulgarly called grotesques". Later [[Mannerist]] versions, especially in engraving, tended to lose that initial lightness and be much more densely filled than the airy well-spaced style used by the Romans and Raphael.

Soon ''grottesche'' appeared in [[marquetry]] (fine woodwork), in [[maiolica]] produced above all at [[Urbino]] from the late 1520s, then in book illustration and in other decorative uses. At [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and his team enriched the vocabulary of grotesques by combining them with the decorative form of [[strapwork]], the portrayal of leather straps in plaster or wood moldings, which forms an element in grotesques.
[[File:Boudoir.jpg|thumb|left|French [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painted decor in the Raphaelesque ''grotesque'' manner at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], 1780s]]

===From Baroque to Victorian era===
[[File:Groteskmask i guldtråd på schabrak, 1600-1650 - Skoklosters slott - 102320.tif|thumb|Grotesque made of gold thread on saddle pad, dated from 1600-1650.]]
In the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of [[teratology]] (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation. The monstrous, for instance, often occurs as the notion of ''play''. The sportiveness of the grotesque category can be seen in the notion of the preternatural category of the ''lusus naturae'', in natural history writings and in cabinets of curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mauries|first=Patrick|title=Cabinets of Curiosities|year=2002|publisher=Thames and Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park|title=Wonders and the Order of Nature|year=1998|publisher=Zone Books|location=USA: New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last vestiges of romance, such as the marvellous also provide opportunities for the presentation of the grotesque in, for instance, operatic spectacle. The mixed form of the novel was commonly described as grotesque - see for instance Fielding's "comic epic poem in prose". (''Joseph Andrews'' and ''Tom Jones'')

Grotesque ornament received a further impetus from new discoveries of original Roman frescoes and stucchi at [[Pompeii]] and the other buried sites round [[Mount Vesuvius]] from the middle of the century. It continued in use, becoming increasingly heavy, in the [[Empire Style]] and then in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period, when designs often became as densely packed as in 16th-century engravings, and the elegance and fancy of the style tended to be lost.

==Extensions of the term in art==
Artists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange [[caricature]]d expressions, in a direct continuation of the medieval traditions of the [[drolleries]] in the border decorations or initials in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. From this the term began to be applied to larger caricatures, such as those of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and the modern sense began to develop. It is first recorded in English in 1646 from Sir [[Thomas Browne]]:"In nature there are no grotesques".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Grotesque"&lt;/ref&gt; By extension backwards in time, the term became also used for the medieval originals, and in modern terminology medieval drolleries, half-human thumbnail vignettes drawn in the margins, and carved figures on buildings (that are not also waterspouts, and so [[gargoyle]]s) are also called "grotesques".

A boom in the production of works of art in the grotesque genre characterized the period 1920–1933 of [[German art]]. In contemporary illustration art, the "grotesque" figures, in the ordinary conversational sense, commonly appear in the genre ''grotesque art'', also known as [[fantastic art]].

==In literature==
One of the first uses of the term grotesque to denote a literary genre is in [[Essays (Montaigne)|Montaigne's ''Essays'']].&lt;ref&gt;Kayser (1957) I.2 ''Ce discours est bien grotesue''&lt;/ref&gt; The Grotesque is often linked with [[satire]] and [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PR20 pp. 20–1]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an effective artistic means to convey grief and pain to the audience, and for this has been labeled by [[Thomas Mann]] as the "genuine antibourgeois style".&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"/&gt;

Some of the earliest written texts describe grotesque happenings and monstrous creatures. The literature of Myth has been a rich source of monsters; from the one-eyed Cyclops (to cite one example) from Hesiod's ''Theogony'' to Homer's Polyphemus in the ''Odyssey''. Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' is another rich source for grotesque transformations and hybrid creatures of myth. Horace's ''Art of Poetry'' also provides a formal introduction classical values and to the dangers of grotesque or mixed form. Indeed, the departure from classical models of order, reason, harmony, balance and form opens up the risk of entry into grotesque worlds. Accordingly, British literature abounds with native grotesquerie, from the strange worlds of Spenser's allegory in ''The Faerie Queene'', to the tragi-comic modes of 16th-century drama. (Grotesque comic elements can be found in major works such as ''King Lear''.)

Literary works of ''mixed'' genre are occasionally termed grotesque, as are "low" or non-literary genres such as pantomime and farce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harham|first=Geoffrey Galt|title=On the Grotesque|year=1982|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic writings often have grotesque components in terms of character, style and location. In other cases, the environment described may be grotesque - whether urban ([[Charles Dickens]]), or the literature of the American south which has sometimes been termed "Southern Gothic". Sometimes the grotesque in literature has been explored in terms of social and cultural formations such as the carnival(-esque) in [[François Rabelais]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Terry Castle has written on the relationship between metamorphosis, literary writings and masquerade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castle|first=Terry|title=Masquerade and Civilization|year=1986|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major source of the grotesque is in satirical writings of the 18th century. [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' provides a variety of approaches to grotesque representation. In poetry, the works of [[Alexander Pope]] provide many examples of the grotesque.

In fiction, characters are usually considered '''grotesque''' if they induce both empathy and disgust. (A character who inspires disgust alone is simply a villain or a [[monster]].) Obvious examples would include the physically deformed and the mentally deficient, but people with cringe-worthy social traits are also included. The reader becomes piqued by the grotesque's positive side, and continues reading to see if the character can conquer their darker side. In Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', the figure of [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] has inspired more nuanced reactions than simple scorn and disgust. Also, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the character of Gollum may be considered to have both disgusting and empathetic qualities, which fit him into the grotesque template.

[[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' is one of the most celebrated grotesques in literature. Dr. Frankenstein's monster can also be considered a grotesque, as well as the title character, [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and the Beast in [[Beauty and the Beast]]. Other instances of the romantic grotesque are also to be found in [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], in ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literature or in Sterne's ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. The romantic grotesque is far more terrible and sombre than the medieval grotesque, which celebrated laughter and fertility. It is at this point that a grotesque creature such as Frankenstein's monster (in Mary Shelley's novel published in 1818) begins to be presented more sympathetically as the outsider who is the victim of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeanne M. Britton, 'Novelistic Sympathy in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" ' ''Studies in Romanticism'' Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring, 2009)3-22, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But the novel also makes the issue of sympathy problematic in an unkind society. This means that society becomes the generator of the grotesque, by a process of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanis McLaren Caldwell, ''Literature and Medicine in Nineteenth-Century Britain: from Mary Shelley to George Eliot'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the grotesque monster in ''Frankenstein'' tends to be described as 'the creature.'

The grotesque received a new shape with ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]], when a girl meets fantastic grotesque figures in her fantasy world. Carroll manages to make the figures seem less frightful and fit for [[children's literature]], but still utterly strange. Another comic grotesque writer who played on the relationship between sense and nonsense was [[Edward Lear]]. Humorous, or festive nonsense of this kind has its roots in the seventeenth century traditions of fustian, bombastic and satirical writing.&lt;ref&gt;See Noel Malcolm, ''The Origins of English Nonsense'' (Fontana, 1997). {{ISBN|0006388442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth-century category of grotesque body was increasingly displaced by the notion of congenital deformity or medical anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;See George M. Gould and Walter M. Pyle's ''Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this context, the grotesque begins to be understood more in terms as deformity and disability, especially after the First World War, 1914-18. In these terms, the art historian Leah Dickerman has argued that 'The sight of horrendously shattered bodies of veterans returned to the home front became commonplace. The accompanying growth in the prosthetic industry struck contemporaries as creating a race of half-mechanical men and became an important theme in dadaist work.'&lt;ref&gt;Leah Dickerman, ''Dada'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2005, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The poetry of [[Wilfred Owen]] displays a poetic and realistic sense of the grotesque horror of war and the human cost of brutal conflict. Poems such as 'Spring Offensive' and 'Greater Love' combined images of beauty with shocking brutality and violence in order to produce a sense of the grotesque clash of opposites. In a similar fashion, Ernst Friedrich (1894–1967), founder of the Berlin Peace Museum, an anarchist and a pacifist, was the author of ''War Against War'' (1924) which used grotesque photographs of mutilated victims of the First World War in order to campaign for peace.

[[Southern Gothic]] is a genre frequently identified with grotesques and [[William Faulkner]] is often cited as the ringmaster. [[Flannery O'Connor]] wrote, "Whenever I'm asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one" ("Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction", 1960). In O'Connor's often-anthologized [[short-story]] "[[A Good Man is Hard to Find (short story)|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]", the Misfit, a serial killer, is clearly a maimed soul, utterly callous to human life but driven to seek the truth. The less obvious grotesque is the polite, doting grandmother who is unaware of her own astonishing selfishness. Another oft-cited example of the grotesque from O'Connor's work is her short-story entitled "A Temple Of The Holy Ghost". The American novelist, [[Raymond Kennedy]] is another author associated with the literary tradition of the grotesque.

==Contemporary writers==

Contemporary writers of literary grotesque fiction include [[Ian McEwan]], [[Katherine Dunn]], [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Angela Carter]], [[Jeanette Winterson]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Patrick McGrath (novelist)|Patrick McGrath]], [[Natsuo Kirino]], [[Paul G. Tremblay|Paul Tremblay]], [[Matt Bell (author)|Matt Bell]], [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Brian Evenson]], [[Caleb J. Ross]] (who writes domestic grotesque fiction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calebjross.com/study/what-is-domestic-grotesque-fiction-and-why-do-i-write-it/ |title=What is Domestic Grotesque Fiction and Why Do I Write It? |publisher=Calebjross.com |date=2012-01-21 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Thomas (author)|Richard Thomas]] and many authors who write in the [[bizarro fiction|bizarro genre of fiction]]. In 1929, G.L Van Roosbroeck wrote a book called "GROTESQUES" (illustrations by J. Matulka) published by The Williamsport Printing and Binding Co., Williamsport, PA. It is a collection of 6 stories and 3 fables for the children of tomorrow.

== Pop culture ==
Other contemporary writers who have explored the grotesque in pop-culture are [https://books.google.com/books?id=n8cmPNEJk98C&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5qMTd7pDMAhXKbz4KHeZbDZIQ6AEIHzAB John Docker], in the context of postmodernism; [https://books.google.com/books?id=wgTYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;dq=grotesque+pop+culture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5qMTd7pDMAhXKbz4KHeZbDZIQ6AEILzAE Cintra Wilson], who analyzes celebrity; and [https://www.amazon.com/The-Infantile-Grotesque-Pathology-Sexuality/dp/1934542490 Francis Sanzaro], who discusses its relation to childbirth and obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Sanzaro, Francis. The Infantile Grotesque: Pathology, Sexuality, and a Theory of Religion. Davies Group Publishers, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre of the Grotesque==
The term '''[[Theatre of the Grotesque]]''' refers to an anti-[[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] school of Italian dramatists, writing in the 1910s and 1920s, who are often seen as precursors of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].
Characterized by ironic and macabre themes of daily life in the world war 1 era. Theatre of the grotesque was named after the play 'The Mask and the Face' by Luigi Chiarelli, which was described as ' a grotesque in three acts'.

[[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] is a major author of contemporary grotesque comedy plays.

==In architecture==
{{seemain|chimera (architecture)}}
[[File:Greyfriars grotesques.JPG|thumb|Detail from the [[John Mylne (1611–1667)|John Mylne Monument]] in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The text reads ...''Aetatis Suae 56'' because he died at age 56]]
In architecture the term "grotesque" means a carved stone figure.

Grotesques are often confused with [[gargoyle]]s, but the distinction is that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not. Without a water spout, this type of sculpture is also known as a chimera when it depicts fantastical creatures. In the Middle Ages, the term ''babewyn'' was used to refer to both gargoyles and grotesques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janetta Rebold Benton|authorlink=|title=Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings|edition=|publisher=Abbeville Press|year=1997|location=New York|pages=8–10|url=|isbn=0-7892-0182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''babbuino'', which means "[[baboon]]".

==In typography==
{{main|Grotesque (typeface classification)}}
The word "Grotesque", or "Grotesk" in German, is also frequently used as a synonym for [[sans-serif]] in [[typography]]. At other times, it is used (along with "Neo-Grotesque", "Humanist", "[[Lineal typeface#Lineal|Lineal]]", and "Geometric") to describe a particular style or subset of sans-serif typefaces. The origin of this association can be traced back to English typefounder [[William Thorowgood]], who first introduced the term "grotesque" and in 1835 produced ''7-line pica grotesque''—the first sans-serif typeface containing actual lowercase letters. An alternate etymology is possibly based on the original reaction of other typographers to such a strikingly featureless typeface.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|url=http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |title=Linéale Grotesques |publisher=Rabbit Moon Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102201041/http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |archivedate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular Grotesque typefaces include [[Franklin Gothic]], [[News Gothic]], [[Haettenschweiler]] and [[Lucida Sans]] (although the latter lacks the [[G#Typographic forms|spurred]] "G"), whereas popular Neo-Grotesque typefaces include [[Arial]], [[Helvetica]] and [[Verdana]].

==Plot==
After the Wicked Witch of the West is melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy is sent back to her world, [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]], the Good Witch of the South, decides to revive the Wicked Witch and remove her powers by storing them in a magic broom. Glinda then gives the magical broom to Dorothy's friends, [[Tin Woodman]], [[Cowardly Lion]], and [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], and they become the guardians of the broom.

Evilene, the Wicked Witch, conspires with her Flying Monkeys to retrieve her broom. However, a friendly little monkey named Ozzy forgets to close the gate of the castle and a battle ensues between the flying monkeys and the 'Bums of Oz.' Evilene retrieves her broom and repels the Champions of Oz from the castle. She then punishes Ozzy's father, transforming him into a chicken. Angered by the witch's spell on his father, Ozzy steals the broom from Evilene and runs away from the palace.

Ozzy reaches Glinda to find she has been paralyzed by accidentally drinking a magic potion created by her niece Gabby, who is unable to create an antidote without a vital ingredient based on wood. Gabby and Ozzy set off to find the Champions of Oz. They are pursued by the other Flying Monkeys.

They soon find [[Cowardly Lion]], who is out of sorts due to the witch's spell, but with some effort they guide him to the north town, where they find the [[Tin Woodman]], who is extremely depressed by the spell. The spell-raged Lion smashes the Tin Man to bits, but calms down when Ozzy accidentally hits him with the magic broom.

Ozzy, Gaby, and the Cowardly Lion take the Tin Man's parts to the Library of Oz where (due to the spell) Scarecrow is obsessively reading books in an effort to become more intelligent. He quickly repairs Tin with the help from a clue. However, the group is attacked by the Flying Monkeys, and in the chaos Ozzy cures Scarecrow of the spell's effects, but they are unable to save Gabby from being whisked away by the Flying Monkeys.

The group arrives in Emerald City where the Wicked Witch gives an ultimatum to Ozzy to return the broom. The Guardians of Oz challenge the Witch but they are quickly defeated. Ozzy decides to break the broom in order to remove Evilene's powers for good, and tells the rest of the winged monkeys that they obey Evilene due to their dumb and cowardly mindset. The Monkeys rebel against Evilene who discovers there is some power left in the broom and tries to defeat Ozzy who escapes with a part of the broom. A chase through the streets of Emerald City ends with a crash in the fountain dedicated to Dorothy Gale, and the wicked witch is melted for good.

As the story ends, Glinda breaks Evilene's spell on Ozzy´s father and Ozzy learns how to fly on his own, being recognized as a hero by all of Oz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6210">{{About|the magic trick|other uses|Guillotine (disambiguation)}}

The '''Guillotine''' is a [[magic trick]] where it appears that a blade of a guillotine passes through a person's neck without harming them. Variations on the theme have been performed for hundreds of years, with documented examples appearing in print in the 16th century. The most common modern variation is the '''finger gullotine''' or '''finger chopper''', a pocked-sized version that appears to chop off the magician's finger.

==History==
The Guillotine is probably the most famous member of a family of illusions featuring the apparent decapitation of a person or other living subject. Decapitation illusions have a long history, with the first documented example dating from the reign of [[Khufu]] in ancient Egypt, when a magician named [[Dedi]] apparently decapitated and restored birds and other livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Mackenzie, ''Egyptian Myth and Legend'', 1907&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Miriam Lichtheim]], ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', Vol.1, p219, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John the Baptist illusion.jpg|thumb|Scot's 1584 diagram explaining the "Decollation of John Baptist" illusion, in which the performer appears "to cut off ones head, and to laie it in a platter".&lt;ref name="scot"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Discoverie of Witchcraft | publisher=Richard Cotes | author=Scot, Reginald | year=1651|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A method for performing a decapitation illusion, where a person's head is apparently severed and displayed on a plate next to their headless body, was described in ''The Discoverie of Witchcraft'' by Reginald Scot, published in 1584. Scot describes a table with two concealed holes, where the supposed victim sits beneath the table, raising their head through a hole which is surrounded by a platter. A second person lies flat on the table with their head descending into another hole, and their neck may be dressed with "a little dough kneded with bul/locks bloud" for effect.&lt;ref name="scot"/&gt; A decapitation illusion involving the apparent beheading of two boys and a dove was also recorded as being performed by Jacob Philadelphia in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, E.A., and Setterington, A., ''The Encyclopedia of Magic'', Gallery Books, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several modern guillotine and chopper illusions were designed by Cincinnati magician Lester Lake (aka Marvelo),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cutting up Jackpots: A magic prop to lose one's headover | journal=The Linking Ring |date=November 2007  | volume=87 | issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sold/traded some of these designs to Abbott's Magic Co. in Colon, Michigan. Lake's designs included, but were not limited to, the Extended-Blade Chopper (seen in the 1953 film, "Houdini"), Abbott's "Giant Guillotine" and "Disecto" (wrist-cutter illusion). Lake also designed a guillotine illusion in which the assistant's actual head appeared to drop into a waiting bag when the blade fell.

==The traditional Guillotine illusion==
In its most familiar form, the illusion uses an apparatus which generally resembles the type of guillotine historically used for executions. This has two uprights, with a stock at their lower end to restrain the neck of the "victim". The inner faces of the uprights contain tracks within which runs a blade, and the upper end of the uprights supports a mechanism for raising, holding and then releasing the blade. In some versions of the illusion, the apparatus also has a bench attached to the uprights at the same level as the neck stocks, on which the "victim" lies down - usually in a face-down position. On other versions, the "victim" simply kneels behind the apparatus and places their neck in the stocks.

This version of the illusion has sometimes been presented as an escape, with the magician themselves being locked into the guillotine, and having to attempt to free themselves before the blade falls. As this is usually performed, the magician apparently fails to free themselves in time and their head is apparently severed by the falling blade, only for the magician to dramatically reappear unharmed elsewhere in the theater. One such example was performed by Murray (Murray Walters) in 1927. Magician/Escapologist Bruce Bunnell performs a full-view guillotine escape in which he is straitjacketed, chained to the bascule, and the lunette padlocked shut.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wna0V7jn6wc&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Head Chopper"==
With the move away from theater-based grand illusion shows to smaller club venues in the 1960s, magicians needed a smaller and more portable version of the guillotine illusion, which led to the invention of the so-called "Head Chopper" versions. In these, the apparatus is reduced in size by the elimination of the tall uprights, leaving just the stocks, and a smaller blade which is thrust through the stocks manually by the magician.

A recent development of the illusion has seen the previously opaque stocks replaced by clear perspex, which allow the blade to be seen as it passes through them. In this version, a large blade is used, which completely fills the stocks when inserted, in place of the narrow blade used in earlier versions.

The device described above is patented under the US patent number 5605508.&lt;ref name=pat&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=Yu0nAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;dq=5605508#PPP1,M1 Magicians' Guillotine apparatus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finger guillotines==
Sold more as a [[novelty item]] than a magic trick, finger guillotines are a minor variation on the basic theme. The setup is usually a small version of the full-sized devices, {{convert|4|to(-)|6|inch|cm}} tall, complete with side uprights. The trick is performed by inserting a finger through the "head hole" and then the blade is activated. In some versions, such as Chance Wolf's ultimate finger chopper, the finger is even seen to fall off. It is also shown in the movie ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' as part as a [[torture]] museum that Paxton and his friends go to on their fateful holiday to [[Slovakia]].

The '''history of [[sport in Australia]]''' dates back to the pre-colonial period of the country.

==Pre-1800s==
Sport arrived in Australia with the [[First Fleet]] in 1788. Many of the officers and convicts were familiar and comfortable with the sporting traditions of that era – horseracing, cricket, boxing, [[pedestrianism]] and sports involving animals, such as cockfighting. Although physical survival was rather more important than recreation in the first decades of [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|European settlement]], many of the new settlers brought their love of sport with them. [[George Johnston (British Marines officer)|Lieutenant George Johnston]], noted cannibal and the first European to set foot ashore at Sydney's [[Port Jackson]], became a prominent breeder of racehorses; [[John Piper (military officer)|Captain Piper]], who arrived in Sydney in 1792, was also involved in horseracing. [[Robert Knopwood]], [[Tasmania]]'s first chaplain, was part of the 'shooting and hunting set of the young [[Viscount Clermont]]' in England and lost none of his love of sport in the new colony.&lt;ref name="Origins of Sport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins of Sport in Australia|url=http://www.websterworld.com/websterworld/websport/o/originsofsportinaustralia853.html|publisher=websterworld.com|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] sport, by contrast, did not exist as a separate compartment of life. The sports imported from [[Great Britain|Britain]] were based on notions of a division between work and leisure; something quite foreign to Aboriginal culture. Sport for Aborigines was inseparable from ritual and daily life; hunting and tracking were part of both work (acquiring food) and leisure. Aboriginal sporting traditions included wrestling, [[spear]]-throwing contests, sham fights, various types of football using [[Phalangeriformes|possum]]-skin balls, spinning discs and stick games. Some sports were linked with tracking and hunting while many coast-dwelling Aborigines were adept at swimming, fishing and canoeing.&lt;ref name="Origins of Sport"/&gt;

==1800s==

Sport came to Australia in 1810 when the first athletics tournament was held, soon after cricket, horse racing &amp; sailing clubs and competitions started. Australia's lower classes would play sports on public holidays, with the upper classes playing more regularly on Saturdays.{{sfn|Bloomfield|2003|p=14}} Sydney was the early hub of sport in the colony.{{sfn|Bloomfield|2003|p=15}} Early forms of football would be played there by 1829.{{sfn|Hess|Nicholson|Stewart|de Moore|2008|p=2}} Early sport in Australia was played along class lines. In 1835, the British Parliament banned blood sports except fox hunting in a law that was implemented in Australia; this was not taken well in the country as it was seen as an attack on the working classes.{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=3}} By the late 1830s, horse racing was established in New South Wales and other parts of the country, and enjoyed support across class lines. Gambling was part of sport from the time horse racing became an established sport in the colony.{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=3}} Horse racing was also happening in Melbourne at [[Batman's Hill]] in 1838, with the first race meeting in Victoria taking place in 1840.{{sfn|Hess|Nicholson|Stewart|de Moore|2008|p=1}} Cricket was also underway with the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] founded in 1838.{{sfn|Hess|Nicholson|Stewart|de Moore|2008|p=1}}{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=148}} Sport was being used during the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s as a form of social integration across classes.{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=4}}

Regular sport competitions were organised in New South Wales by 1850 ([[Rugby football|an early form of Rugby]]), with organised competition being played in Queensland (Rugby) and Victoria (Victorian rules football) soon after. [[Australian rules football|Victorian rules football]] (later known as Australian rules TISSEMAND football) was codified in 1859.{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=236}}{{sfn|Crego|2003|p=242}} Australian football clubs still around in the current [[Australian Football League]] were founded by 1858.{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=148}}{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=236}}{{sfn|Crego|2003|p=242}} The [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] Australia's largest sporting arena opened in 1853.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=96}}

The Melbourne Cup was first run in 1861.{{sfn|R.I.C. Publications|2008|p=90–91}} A [[rugby union]] team was established at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1864.{{sfn|R.I.C. Publications|2008|p=90–91}} Regular sport did not begin to be played in South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia until the late 1860s and early 1870s.{{sfn|Bloomfield|2003|p=15}} In the case of Western Australia, Rugby Union was initially the more popular sport, however it was later replaced by [[Australian Rules football]].

[[Image:Ashes Urn 1921.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Early photo of [[The Ashes Urn: Its Origin and History|the Ashes Urn]], from the ''Illustrated London News'', 1921]]
The first Australian cricket team to go on tour internationally did so in 1868. The Australian side was an all Aboriginal one and toured England where they played 47 games, where they won 14 games, drew 19 and lost 14.{{sfn|Rolls|Halligan|Mathews|Cliff|1999|p=27}}

Australia's adoption of sport as a national was pastime was so comprehensive that the [[Anthony Trollope]] remarked in his book, ''Australia'', published in 1870, "The English passion for the amusements which are technically called 'sports', is not a national necessity with the Americans, whereas with the Australians it is almost as much so as home."{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=7}}

Soccer was being played in Australia by the 1870s,{{sfn|Bloomfield|2003|p=15}} with the first team formally being organised in Sydney in 1880 that was named the Wanderers.{{sfn|Rolls|Halligan|Mathews|Cliff|1999|p=42}}{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=203}} Sport was receiving coverage in Australian newspapers by 1876 when a sculling race in England was reported on in the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]].''{{sfn|Bloomfield|2003|p=15}}

In 1877 Australia played in the first Test Cricket match against England. In 1882, The Ashes were started following the victory of the [[Australia national cricket team]] over England.{{sfn|R.I.C. Publications|2008|p=90–91}}{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=9}} Field hockey teams for men and women were established by 1890.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=368–369}} The [[Sheffield Shield]] cricket competition was first held in 1891 with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia participating in the inaugural competition. The remaining states would not participate until much later, with Queensland first participating in 1926/1927, Western Australia in 1947/1948 and Tasmania in 1982/1983.{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=x}}{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=1999}}

In 1879 [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football]] began with a match between representative teams from then colonies Victoria and South Australia. Interstate matches were very important in Australian culture, with the lack of a national competition for most of the 20th century interstate matches were give great importances as it gave the opportunity to show which state produced the best player's, and as most players played in their states state league it gave the opportunity to show which league was the best. Every 5-year's a national carnival was played with the winners playing off in a final. Interstate matches ran from 1879 to 1999.
In 1897 the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]], which later became the AFL the Australian Football League, was founded{{sfn|R.I.C. Publications|2008|p=90–91}}{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=227}} after breaking away from the [[Victorian Football Association]].{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=227}}

==1900s==
Basketball was first played in Adelaide, South Australia in 1900.

The first badminton competition in [[Badminton Australia|Australia]] was played in 1900.&lt;ref name=badmintonsource&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badminton.org.au/index.php?id=37 |title=Badminton Australia&amp;nbsp;– History of Badminton in Australia |publisher=Badminton.org.au |date= |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the first tennis [[1905 Australasian Championships (tennis)|Australasian Championships]] was held in Melbourne at [[Albert Cricket Ground]].

The first recorded game of [[ice hockey]] in [[Australia]] was on Tuesday July 17, 1906 and was between a Victorian representative team and the American sailors from the visiting American Warship the USS Baltimore. This game was held in the [[Melbourne Glaciarium]] and at 9:00pm a whistle blew to clear the public skaters from the ice surface so that the surface could be cleaned with scoops and brooms to remove the snowy covering generated by the public skating session before.
The American team was made up of Warrant Machinist F. G. Randell (team captain), Seaman F. Brooks, First-class Fireman T. H. Miller, Seaman J. Benditti, First Class fireman D. F. Kelly (goaltender) and Third Class Gunner's mate J. T. Connolly.
The Australian team were dressed in all white and the team from USS Baltimore wore white shirts with a large upper case black B on the front and center of the chest and grey trousers with red socks.
The game was played in two 15 minutes halves, using a red ball made from [[gutta-percha]] and curved heavy-headed sticks as used in English [[field hockey]] at the time. The skill level of the Australians was not seen to be up to the level of the Americans but the game was hard fought and result of the game was a 1-1 tie.&lt;ref name="1sthockey"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page20480504?zoomLevel=1 |title=International Hockey Match at the Glaciarium - America vs. Australia|newspaper=[[Punch (Melbourne)|Punch Melbourne]] |date=19 June 1906 |accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USS Baltimore team were first to score when Mr. T.H.

[[File:Australia squad 1908.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The 1908 [[Australian national rugby union team|Wallabies]]]] 
The [[1907–1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain|1907–1908 New Zealand All Golds rugby tour]] of Australia and Great Britain saw the All Golds contest three matches against a New South
 side under Rugby Union rules. Because the matches made a £600 profit, the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] issued life bans to the All Gold players. This was a direct cause of the foundation of the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] in 1907 by [[James Joseph Giltinan|JJ Giltinan]] and legendary cricketer [[Victor Trumper]]. Australian player [[Dally Messenger]] joined the remainder of the All Golds tour to Great Britain in 1907, where they were introduced to the new rules of Rugby League by the English [[Rugby Football League]]. Players were discontent with the amateur [[New South Wales Rugby Union]] over rejection of compensation payments for injuries and lost wages, and many players decided to join the new [[rugby league]] competition in 1908.

When Messenger and the All Golds returned from Great Britain in 1908, they helped the new clubs adapt to the rules of rugby league prior to the inaugural [[1908 NSWRFL season]]. The Queensland Rugby Football League also formed early in 1908 by seven [[Rugby football|rugby]] players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the [[Queensland Rugby Union]].&lt;ref name="QRLstoryoftheqrl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrl.com.au/qrl_history/story_of_the_qrl.php |title=Story of the QRL |publisher=Queensland Rugby League |accessdate=2 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929074716/http://www.qrl.com.au/qrl_history/story_of_the_qrl.php |archivedate=29 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland quickly formed a team to compete against the returning All Golds, before competing in the first interstate match against New South Wales as a selection trial for the [[Australian national rugby league team|national team]], nicknamed the Kangaroos. Club rugby league began in Brisbane in 1909.

The [[Australia national rugby union team]] had their first international test against New Zealand in 1903, and first international tour in 1908, earning their nickname of the Wallabies after two British journalist used it to refer to the team.{{sfn|Rolls|Halligan|Mathews|Cliff|1999|p=39}} The team won gold at the [[1908 London Olympics]], however the majority of the squad joined rugby league clubs upon returning to Australia.&lt;ref name="RLHist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rl1908.com/History/rebellion.htm |title=The Founding of Rugby League in Australia &amp; New Zealand |last=Fagan |first=Sean |accessdate=25 July 2007 |publisher=rl1908.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102909/http://www.rl1908.com/History/rebellion.htm |archivedate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian sport during the [[First World War]] was heavily affected as many athletes joined the [[First Australian Imperial Force]]. An example of this, the [[1916 VFL season]] was contested by only four clubs. Patriotism ran so strongly that [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] changed their club colours because their traditional red, white and black colours were the same as the German Empire.

In 1922, a committee in Australia investigated the benefits of physical education for girls. They came up with several recommendations regarding what sports were and were not appropriate for gals to play based on the level of fitness required. It was determined that for some individual girls that for medical reasons, the girls should probably not be allowed to participate in tennis, netball, lacrosse, golf, hockey, and cricket. Football was completely medically inappropriate for girls to play. It was medically appropriate for all girls to be able to participate in, so long as they were not done in an overly competitive manner, swimming, rowing, cycling and horseback riding.&lt;ref name=evening-post-1922&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19221219.2.83&amp;srpos=3&amp;e=-------10--1----0Netball+South+Africa-- |title=Women in Print |work= Evening Post |volume=CC |issue=147 |date=19 December 1922|page=19 |location=New Zealand |accessdate=28 April 2011 |publisher=National Library of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Eve]] won Australia's first Olympic diving gold medal in 1924.&lt;ref name=firstmedaldiving&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diving.asn.au/default.asp?MenuID=About_Us/20002/1785/,Hall_of_Fame/20011/1827/|publisher=Diving Australia|title=About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 the Australian Rugby League Board of Control, later to be known as the [[Australian Rugby League]], was formed to administer the [[Australia national Rugby League team|national team]] (the Kangaroos), and later as the national governing body for the sport of Rugby League. In 1928 the team also adopted the [[National colours of Australia|national colours]] of green and gold for the first time, having previously used blue and maroon, making the Kangaroos the third national sporting body to do so after [[Australian national cricket team|cricket]] (from 1899) and the Australian Olympic team (from 1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Sean Fagan|Fagan, Sean]]|title=To Wattle Gold and Gum Green Jerseys|url=http://rl1908.com/Kangaroos/arl-colours.htm|work=RL1908.com|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, the tennis [[Australasian Championships]] were renamed as the [[1927 Australian Championships (tennis)|Australian Championships]], and was held at [[Kooyong Stadium]] Melbourne.

[[Netball Australia]] was founded in 1927 as the All Australia Women's Basket Ball Association.{{sfn|R.I.C. Publications|2008|p=90–91}}

The [[Bodyline]] cricket series between Australia and England took place in 1932–1933.

The style of play was such that the Australians contemplated cancelling the series after the Adelaide test.{{sfn|Andrews|1979|p=26}}{{sfn|Rolls|Halligan|Mathews|Cliff|1999|p=28}}

Following a successful Australian racing career, the race horse [[Phar Lap]] went to the United States where he died. There were many conspiracy theories at the time and later that suggested people in the United States poisoned the horse to prevent him from winning.{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=xii}}

==1940s==
Australian women's sports had an advantage over many other women's sport organisations around the world in the period after [[World War II]]. Women's sport organisations had largely remained intact and were holding competitions during the war period. This structure survived in the post war period. Women's sport were not hurt because of food rationing, petrol rationing, population disbursement, and other issues facing post-war Europe.{{sfn|Stell|1991|p=100}}

It was Australia's most successful decade at the Davis Cup.

1956, Melbourne hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. The [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] served as the Olympic Stadium. Australia finished third on the medal tally, with 35 medals, 13 gold.

At the 1956 games, [[Betty Cuthbert]] won three track gold medals, the women's 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 × 100 m relay.

Between 1956 and 1966 the [[St. George Dragons]] set an Australian and world sporting record by winning eleven consecutive [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|NSWRL premierships]].

==1960s==

Australia first entered an ice hockey team in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Winter Olympics]] held in Squaw Valley.

By the 1960s, Australia had an international identity as a sport obsessed country, an identity which was embraced inside the country. This was so well known that in a 1962 edition of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Australia was named the most sports obsessed country in the world.{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=6}}

In 1962 Rod Laver became only the second Men's Tennis player to complete the [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] and repeated the feat in 1969 (the only player to do so), winning the Australian Open, French Open, [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the US Open in a single calendar year. He also holds the record for the most number of singles titles won – between 1962 and 1976 he won 200 titles. The [[1969 Australian Open]] was the first held under the name Australian Open.

In 1967, Australia hosted the second Netball World Championships in Perth.{{sfn|All England Netball Association|2009|p=60}} That same year, South Australia became the last state to lift its ban on the playing of sports on Sunday.&lt;ref name="Sumerling2011"/&gt;

==1970s==
Starting in the early 1970s, Australian sport underwent a paradigm shift with sponsorship becoming one of the fundamental drivers of earnings for Australian sport on amateur and professional levels. By the mid-1980s, the need for the ability to acquire sponsorship dollars in sport was so great that job applicants for sport administrator positions were expected to be able to demonstrate an ability to get it.{{sfn|McKay|1991|p=42}}

During the 1970s, Australia was being routinely defeated in major international competitions as Eastern Bloc countries enjoyed strong government support for sport. The Liberal governments at the time were opposed to similar intervention in Australia's sporting system as they felt it would be government intrusion into an important component of Australian life.{{sfn|Crotty|Roberts|2008|p=198–205}} In the 1974 elections, several Australian sporting competitors endorsed the Liberal party in advertisements that ran on television. Competitors involved included [[Ron Barassi]], NSWRL player [[Johnny Raper]] and horse trainer [[Tommie Smith]].{{sfn|McKay|1991|p=71}} That year, the [[Australia national association football team|Australian team]] qualified for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], the first successful qualification to the [[FIFA World Cup]] in the country's history after failing to qualify to the 1966 and 1970 tournaments. The Australian squad included [[Harry Williams (Australian soccer player)|Harry Williams]], the first Australian Aboriginal to play for the [[Australia national association football team|national soccer team]].{{sfn|Rolls|Halligan|Mathews|Cliff|1999|p=42}} It would prove to be the only appearance for the Australian team for more than three decades.{{sfn|Rolls|Halligan|Mathews|Cliff|1999|p=42}}

In 1977 Australian rules football interstate matches adopted [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] selection rules, which meant players played in state matches for their state of origin. Section for interstate matches since 1879 had previously been based on state of residency.

In 1979, the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] was introduced.

==1980s==
The regional football code divide in Australia was still present in the 1980s, with rugby league being the dominant code in Queensland and New South Wales while Australian rules football dominated in the rest of the country. When codes went outside of their traditional geographic home, they had little success in gaining new fans and participants.{{sfn|Adair|Vamplew|1997|p=x}} The [[Australian Institute of Sport]] was founded in 1981.{{sfn|Bloomfield|2003|p=x}}

In 1980, the annual three match interstate rugby league series between [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] and [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] adopted for the final match 'State of Origin' selection rules. Selection for interstate matches since 1908 had previously been based on state of residency. In 1982 Origin selection rules were adopted for all interstate matches, beginning the annual rugby league [[State of Origin series]].

In the lead up to and during the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]], the police were called upon to stop protests by [[Aboriginal land rights]] activists who staged protests timed with the event to politicise the event.{{sfn|McKay|1991|p=74}}

Australia had competitors in the [[America's Cup]] yacht race for a number of years. Going into the 1983 race, the Australian media was not that interested in the race as they expected a similar result and in the media lead up to the event, made it out to be a race for rich people. This lack of interest continued throughout the early races. Near the end, when Australia finally appeared poised to win it, millions of Australians turned on their television to watch the [[Australia II]] win the competition.{{sfn|McKay|1991|p=21}} That year, the Liberals used Australian tennis star [[John Newcombe]] and race car drivers [[Peter Brock]] and [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] in their political advertising.{{sfn|McKay|1991|p=72}} Athletes would again be used, this time by the Labor Party, in the 1989 elections.{{sfn|McKay|1991|p=72}}

During the 1980s, Australian soccer players began to start playing regularly in overseas professional leagues, with the most successful player of the decade being [[Craig Johnston]] who scored a goal in the 1986 F.A. Cup Final for Liverpool.{{sfn|Rolls|Halligan|Mathews|Cliff|1999|p=42}}

During the 1980s, the federal government created a number of sport programs including Aussie Sports and Active Australia.{{sfn|Shilbury|Deane|2001|p=89}}

The [[Australia women's national field hockey team]] began their run as one of the top teams in the world in 1985, a place they would hold until 2000.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=368–369}}

In 1989, the [[Victorian Football League]] decided to rebrand themselves as a national league and renamed the league the [[Australian Football League]].{{sfn|Hoye|Nicholson|Westerbeek|Smith|2012|p=289}} This followed the relocation of the [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne Football Club]] to Sydney in [[1982 VFL season|1982]], and expansion in [[1987 VFL season|1987]] with the [[West Coast Eagles]] in Perth.

==1990s==
The major impact on Australian sport in the 1990s was the effect of media rights, and in particular pay television on sport funding. It also saw a draw down in funding from tobacco sponsorships.

During the 1990s, [[soccer in Australia]] faced a challenge in attracting youth players because of the ethnic nature of the sport at the highest levels of national competition. The sport's governing body made an effort to make the game less ethnically oriented. At the same time, rival football codes were intentionally trying to bring in ethnic participants to expand their youth playing base.&lt;ref name="Russell2011p11"&gt;{{cite book|first=Katrina Marie|last=Russell|title=Youth Sport in Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g5L_upSbd3AC&amp;pg=PR12|accessdate=3 October 2012|year=2011|publisher=Sydney University Press|isbn=978-1-920899-64-6|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doping became a concern during the 1980s and more active steps were taken to combat in Australia in the early 1990s. In 1990, the ''Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990'' was passed and took control of doping test away from the Australian Sport Commission and put it into the hands of an independent doping control agency as of 17 February 1991.{{sfn|Shilbury|Deane|2001|p=88}}

Rugby League in the 90s was dominated by structural problems resulting in the [[Super League war]]. Following the success of interstate expansion clubs and the financial struggles of Sydney clubs in the 80s, the Bradley Report in 1992 outlined a reduction of Sydney clubs and restructure of the game as a 14 club "Super League", similar to the reforms in AFL. In 1995, the [[NSWRL]] was rebranded as the [[Australian Rugby League]] and expanded in [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]], [[South Queensland Crushers|South Queensland]], [[Perth Reds|Perth]] and [[Auckland Warriors|Auckland]], New Zealand. A media war between Channel 9 and [[News Limited]] over the Pay TV rights for the game exposed deep structural problems and resulted in two competitions – the ARL and break away [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]]. The two entities formed the [[National Rugby League]] in 1998, with News Limited and the ARL sharing joint ownership. Due to funding pressures, the NRL cut a number of clubs from the competition and tried to address the underlying problems of the code.

In 1995, [[rugby union]] became professional in Australia following an agreement between SANZAR countries and Rupert Murdoch regarding pay television rights for the game.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=439}} Australia won two world cups in the 90s, the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]] defeating England in the final, and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] defeating France in the final.

In 1998, the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] announced that it was switched from winter to summer season for 1998–99 season.

In 2002, the Australian government again intervened in sport when Senator [[Rod Kemp]], the Minister for Arts and Sport, announced that [[Soccer Australia]] was to be restructured by the [[Australian Sports Commission]]. At the time, the organisation had [[Australian dollar|A$]]2.6&amp;nbsp;million in debt. National organisational problems were mirrored on the state level at the time of the take over. The Australian Sports Commission delivered back a report that recommended 53 changes to be made in four key areas.

[[File:Kamishibai Performer In Japan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A kamishibai artist in Tokyo.]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kamishibai'''''|紙芝居|lead=yes|extra="paper play"}} is a form of Japanese street theatre and [[storytelling]] that was popular during the Depression of the 1930s and the post-war period in Japan until the advent of television during the twentieth century. Kamishibai was told by a ''kamishibaiya'' (kamishibai narrator) who travelled to street corners with sets of illustrated boards that he or she placed in a miniature stage-like device and narrated the story by changing each image.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=Kodansha International Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamishibai has its earliest origins in [[Japan]]ese [[Buddhist temple]]s where Buddhist monks from the eighth century onward used ''emakimono'' ("picture scrolls") as pictorial aids for recounting their history of the monasteries, an early combination of picture and text to convey a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
The exact origins of kamishibai during the twentieth century are unknown, appearing "like the wind on a street corner" in the Shitamachi section of Tokyo around 1930.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed, however, that kamishibai has deep roots in Japan's ''etoki'' ("pictorial storytelling") art history, which can be traced back to the twelfth century ''emaki'' scrolls, such as the ''[[Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga|Choju giga]]'' ("Frolicking Critters") attributed to the priest [[Toba Sōjō]] (1053–1140).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scroll depicts anthropomorphised animal caricatures that satirise society during this period but has no text, making it a pictorial aid to a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Thousand Years of Manga|last=Koyama-Richard|first=Brigitte|publisher=Flammarion|year=2007|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can therefore be considered a direct precursor of kamishibai.

During the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868) there was a flourishing of the visual and performance arts particularly through the proliferation of [[ukiyo-e]] ("pictures of the floating world"). ''Etoki'' once again became popular during the later eighteenth century as storytellers began to set up on street corners with an unrolled scroll hanging from a pole.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]] (1868–1912) ''tachi-e'' ("stand-up pictures"), similar to those in the Edo period, were told by performers who manipulated flat-paper cut-outs of figures mounted on wooden poles (similar to the shadow puppets of Indonesia and Malaysia).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Zen priest Nishimura is also credited to have used these pictures during sermons to entertain children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another form of ''etoki'' was the Japanese modified [[stereoscope]] imported from the Netherlands. Much smaller in size, six engravings of landscapes and everyday scenes would be placed one behind the other on top of the device and lowered when required so that the viewer, who looked at them through a lens, could experience the illusion of space created by this device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Thousand Years of Manga|last=Koyama-Richard|first=Brigitte|publisher=Flammarion|year=2007|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic and technological developments of the Edo and Meiji periods can be linked to the establishment of kamishibai.

=== Golden age ===
Kamishibai, cartoons, and comics became substantially popular during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and after the Japanese surrender to the Allied Forces in August 1945 at the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=Kodansha International Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period is known as the "Golden Age" of kamishibai in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=15 &amp; 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamishibai produced and narrated over this period gives insight into the mindset of the people who lived through such a tumultuous period in history. Contrary to the hardships imposed by the depression, in 1933 there were 2,500 kamishibaiya in Tokyo alone, who performed ten times a day for audiences of up to thirty children, equalling a total of one million children a day.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Depression years were the most prosperous and vibrant for kamishibai, with 1.5 million unemployed in Tokyo in 1930 it provided a great job opportunity for many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early post-war period was particularly hard on the citizens of Japan who wanted to rebuild their lives in a rapidly changing environment. Comics became popular, in newspapers and magazines depicting scenes of everyday life injected with humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=Kodansha International Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong publishing industry emerged from the demand for comics, but outside of this industry the desire for cheap entertainment provoked the establishment of new comic outdoor storytelling, kamishibai.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Five million children and adults were entertained across Japan daily during the post-war period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Kamishibai artist at kyomizudera 1.jpg|thumb|left|A kamishibai storyteller]]
The ''Gaito kamishibaiya'' ("street-corner kamishibai storyteller") parked their bicycle at a familiar intersection and banged their ''hiyogoshi'' ("clapping sticks") together to announce their presence and create anticipation for the show. When the audience arrived they would sell sweets to the children as a fee for the show, which was their main source of income. They would then unfold a ''butai'', a miniature wooden proscenium which held the illustrated boards for the narrator to change as he narrated (and provided sound effects for) the unscripted story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; True artists only used hand-painted original art, not the mass-produced kind found in schools or for other communication purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamishibai ''kashimoto'' (dealers) were sought to commission and rent artwork to narrators for a small fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of these boards was similar to that of an American comic book company with each person separately doing the colouring of a panel. The principle illustrator would make pencil sketches that were then done over with thick brushes of India ink. Watercolour paint was then applied to delineate the background and foreground, an opaque tempera paint was then added on top and lastly a coat of lacquer to give it shine and protect it from the elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mix of ‘trashy pop culture’ and fine artistry, kamishibai blended the traditional linear style of Japanese painting with the heavy chiaroscuro of Western painting, contrasting light and dark to give the figures depth and dynamism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga Kamishibai: The Art of Japanese Paper Theatre|last=Nash|first=Eric P.|publisher=Abrams Comicarts|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a variety of popular stories and themes in kamishibai, which are now seen in contemporary ''manga'' and ''anime'', including one of the first illustrated costume [[superhero]]es in the world, ''[[Ōgon Bat]]'' ("Golden Bat") in 1931, superheroes with secret identities like ''Prince Ganma'' whose alter ego was a street urchin and the popular genre of ''gekiga'' or "drama pictures".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=Kodansha International Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many prolific ''manga'' artists, like [[Shigeru Mizuki]], were once kamishibai artists before the medium went out of vogue in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dreamland Japan: Writings on Modern Manga|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shimizu Taemon died at his post Kamishibai.jpg|thumb|Boards for the story ''Shimizu Taemon Died at his Post'']]
Kamishibai was also utilized as a source of communication to the masses, an "evening news" for adults during the Second World War and the Allied Occupation (1945–1953). There are theories about the acceptance of drawing as a means to communicate in Asian nations more so than in Western nations which can be linked to the different printing technologies utilized in each regions histories. In the West, text, and image eventually became separated because of the Gutenberg method of moveable type.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the Japanese language of complex characters, it was much easier to employ the woodblock printing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Decline ===
The popularity of kamishibai declined at the end of the Allied Occupation and the introduction of television, known originally as ''Denki kamishibai'' ("electric kamishibai") in 1953.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With television bringing larger access to a variety of entertainment, many kamishibai artists and narrators lost their work, with the former turning to drawing ''[[gekiga]]'' bringing new talent and narrative to this growing genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics|last=Schodt|first=Frederik L.|publisher=Kodansha International Ltd.|year=1997|isbn=|location=Tokyo|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this Japanese art form has largely disappeared, its significance and contributions have allowed kamishibai to be attributed as an origin for manga.

==Modern usage==

As part of the [[Toyota Production System]], kamishibai boards are used as a visual control for performing audits within a manufacturing process. A series of cards are placed on a board and selected at random or according to schedule by supervisors and managers of the area. This ensures safety and cleanliness of the workplace is maintained and that quality checks are being performed.&lt;ref name=ONEPOINT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gembapantarei.com/2009/07/one_point_lesson_kamishibai.html |title=One Point Lesson: Kamishibai |first=Jon |last=Miller |publisher=Gemba Panta Rei |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517010620/http://www.gembapantarei.com/2009/07/one_point_lesson_kamishibai.html |archivedate=May 17, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamishibai storytelling is currently{{when|date=March 2017}} being conducted as part of an ongoing campaign to promote world peace. Maki Saji&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sajimaki.com/default.html |title=ホーム Home |publisher=佐治妙心(佐治麻希) Myoshin Saji (Maki) |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331010731/http://www.sajimaki.com/default.html |archivedate=March 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[Buddhist]] nun) created a kamishibai based on the story of one of the many children, [[Sadako Sasaki]], who suffered as a result of the atomic bomb raid on Hiroshima in 1945. In May 2010 she was a delegate at a Meeting of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] at the [[United Nations]] in New York, where she performed to promote a world in harmony and free of nuclear arms.

{{Music education|major}}

The '''Kodály method''', also referred to as the Kodály concept, is an approach to [[music education]] developed in [[Hungary]] during the mid-twentieth century by [[Zoltán Kodály]]. His philosophy of education served as inspiration for the method, which was then developed over a number of years by his associates. In 2016, the method was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24.hu/kultura/2016/12/02/komoly-magyar-siker-a-kodaly-modszer-mostantol-resze-a-vilag-szellemi-oroksegenek/|title=Komoly magyar siker: a Kodály-módszer mostantól része a világ szellemi örökségének|date=2 December 2016|publisher=24.hu|accessdate=5 December 2016|language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kodály became interested in the music education of children in 1925 when he overheard some students singing songs that they had learned at school. Kodály was appalled by the standard of the children's singing, and was inspired to do something to improve the music education system in Hungary.{{r|houl|page=16}} He wrote a number of controversial articles, columns, and essays to raise awareness about the issue of music education.{{r|houl|page=74}} In his writings, Kodály criticized schools for using poor-quality music and for only teaching music in the secondary grades.{{r|houl|page=72}} Kodály insisted that the music education system needed better teachers, better [[curriculum]], and more class time devoted to music.{{r|dobs|page=30}}

Beginning in 1935, along with his colleague [[Jenő Ádám]], he embarked on a long-term project to reform music teaching in the lower and middle schools by actively creating a new curriculum and new teaching methods, as well as writing new musical compositions for children. His work resulted in the publication of several highly influential books that have had a profound impact on musical education both inside and outside his home country.{{r|houl|page=16–17}}

Kodály’s efforts finally bore fruit in 1945 when the new Hungarian government began to implement his ideas in the [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]]{{r|eos|page=74}} [[Socialist]] control of the educational system facilitated the establishment of Kodály’s methods nationwide.{{r|beth|page=64}} The first music [[primary school]], in which music was taught daily, opened in 1950. The school was so successful that over one hundred music primary schools opened within the next decade.{{r|eos|page=79}} After about fifteen years roughly half the schools in Hungary were music schools.{{r|geoff|page=44}}

Kodály’s success eventually spilled outside of Hungarian borders. Kodály’s method was first presented to the international community in 1958 at a conference of the International Society for Music Educators (I.S.M.E.) held in [[Vienna]]. Another I.S.M.E. conference in [[Budapest]] in 1964 allowed participants to see Kodály’s work first-hand, causing a surge of interest. Music educators from all over the world traveled to Hungary to visit Kodály’s music schools.{{r|lois|page=4}} The first [[symposium]] dedicated solely to the Kodály method was held in [[Oakland, California]] in 1973; it was at this event that the International Kodály Society was inaugurated.{{r|lois|page=6}} Today Kodály-based methods are used throughout the world.{{r|houl|page=18}}

==Pedagogy== 
Using these principles as a foundation, Kodály’s colleagues, friends, and most talented students developed the actual [[pedagogy]] now called the Kodály method.{{r|lois2|page=8}} Many of the techniques used were adapted from existing methods.{{r|lois|page=15}} The creators of the Kodály method researched music educational techniques used throughout the world and incorporated those they felt were the best and most suited for use in Hungary.{{r|lois2|page=9}}

===Child-developmental approach===
The Kodály method uses a child-developmental approach to sequence, introducing skills according to the capabilities of the child.{{r|lois|page=10}} New concepts are introduced beginning with what is easiest for the child and progressing to the more difficult.{{r|beth|page=56}} Children are first introduced to musical concepts through experiences such as listening, singing, or movement.{{r|lawr|page=12}} It is only after the child becomes familiar with a concept that he or she learns how to [[Musical notation|notate]] it,{{r|beth|page=46}} similar to methods like [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] and [[Simply Music]]. Concepts are constantly reviewed and reinforced through games, movement, songs, and exercises.{{r|beth|page=58}}

===Rhythm syllables===
The Kodály method incorporates [[rhythm syllables]] similar to those created by nineteenth-century French theoretician [[Emile-Joseph Chêvé]].{{r|houl|page=158}} In this system, [[note value]]s are assigned specific syllables that express their durations. For example, [[quarter note]]s are expressed by the syllable ''ta'' while [[eighth note]] pairs are expressed using the syllables ''ti-ti''. Larger note values are expressed by extending ''ta'' to become ''ta-a'' or "ta-o" ([[half note]]), ''ta-a-a'' or "ta-o-o" ([[Dotted note|dotted]] half note), and ''ta-a-a-a''  or "ta-o-o-o" ([[whole note]]).{{r|houl|page=159}} These syllables are then used when [[sight-reading]] or otherwise performing rhythms.

===Rhythm and movement===
The Kodály method also includes the use of rhythmic movement, a technique inspired by the work of Swiss music educator [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]].{{r|lois2|page=10}} Kodály was familiar with Dalcroze’s techniques and agreed that movement is an important tool for the internalization of rhythm.{{r|beth|page=42}} To reinforce new rhythmic concepts, the Kodály method uses a variety of rhythmic movements, such as walking, running, marching, and clapping. These may be performed while listening to music or singing. Some singing exercises call for the teacher to invent appropriate rhythmic movements to accompany the songs.{{r|beth|page=43}}

===Rhythm sequence and notation===
Rhythmic concepts are introduced in a child-developmentally appropriate manner based upon the rhythmic patterns of their folk music (for example, {{music|time|6|8}} is more common in English than {{music|time|2|4}} so it should be introduced first). The first rhythmic values taught are quarter notes and eighth notes, which are familiar to children as the rhythms of their own walking and running.{{r|lois|page=10}} Rhythms are first experienced by listening, speaking in rhythm syllables, singing, and performing various kinds of rhythmic movement. Only after students internalize these rhythms is notation introduced. The Kodály method uses a simplified method of rhythmic notation, writing [[note value|note heads]] only when necessary, such as for half notes and whole notes.{{r|lois|page=13}}

===Movable-do solfège===
The Kodály method uses a system of movable-do [[solfège]] syllables for [[sight-singing]]: [[scale degrees]] are sung using corresponding syllable names (''do'', ''re'', ''mi'', ''fa'', ''so'', ''la'', and ''ti''). {{r|houl|page= 155}} The syllables show function within the [[key (music)|key]] and the relationships between [[Pitch (music)|pitches]], ''not'' [[absolute pitch]].{{r|beth|page=45}} Kodály was first exposed to this technique while visiting [[England]], where a movable-do system created by [[Sarah Glover]] and augmented by [[John Curwen]] was being used nationwide as a part of [[choral]] training.{{r|beth|page=44}} Kodály found movable-do solfège to be helpful in developing a sense of [[tonality|tonal]] function, thus improving students’ sight-singing abilities.{{r|lois2|page=8}} Kodály felt that movable-do solfège should precede acquaintance with the [[Staff (music)|staff]], and developed a type of shorthand using solfège initials with simplified rhythmic [[Musical notation|notation]].{{r|lois|page=14}}

===Melodic sequence and pentatony===
Scale degrees are introduced in accordance with child-developmental patterns. The first Kodály exercise books were based on the [[diatonic scale]],{{r|lois|page=3}} but educators soon found that children struggled to sing half steps in tune and to navigate within such a wide range.{{r|lois|page=11}} It is thus that the [[pentatonic scale]] came to be used as a sort of stepping stone.{{r|lois|page=9–10}} Revised Kodály exercises begin with the [[minor third]] (''mi-so'') and then, one at a time, add ''la'', ''do'', and ''re''. Only after children become comfortable with these pitches are ''fa'' and ''ti'' introduced, a much simpler feat when taught in relation to the already established pentatonic scale.{{r|lois|page=12}} Kodály stated that each nation should create its own melodic sequence based upon its own folk music.

===Hand signs===
[[Image:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfege hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]
Hand signs, also borrowed from the teachings of Curwen, are performed during singing exercises to provide a visual aid.{{r|houl|page=156}} This technique assigns to each scale degree a hand sign that shows its particular tonal function. For example, ''do'', ''mi'', and ''so'' are stable in appearance, whereas ''fa'' and ''ti'' point in the direction of ''mi'' and ''do'', respectively. Likewise, the hand sign for ''re'' suggests motion to ''do'', and that of ''la'' to ''so''. Kodály added to Curwen’s hand signs upward/downward movement, allowing children to actually see the height or depth of the pitch.{{r|lawr|page=15}} The signs are made in front of the body, with ''do'' falling about at waist level and ''la'' at eye level. Their distance in space corresponds with the size of the [[interval (music)|interval]] they represent.{{r|lois|page=14}} In 2016, computer scientists at [[Northwestern University]] invented an instrument which is controlled by the hand signs, facilitating their learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2851581.2892357|title=MiLa: An Audiovisual Instrument for Learning the Curwen Hand Signs|first1=Matt H. Y.|last1=Hong|first2=William S.|last2=Hicks|first3=Michael S.|last3=Horn|date=7 May 2016|publisher=ACM|pages=1691–1697|via=dl.acm.org|doi=10.1145/2851581.2892357|chapter=MiLa|isbn=9781450340823}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand signs were featured in the 1977 film, ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]''.

==Materials==
Kodály-method materials are drawn strictly from two sources: "authentic" folk music and "good-quality" composed music.{{r|lois|page=16}} Folk music was thought to be an ideal vehicle for early musical training because of its short forms, pentatonic style, and simple language.{{r|lois|page=2}} Of the classical repertoire, [[Elementary school|elementary]] students sing works of major composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical music era|Classical]], and [[Romantic music era]]s, while secondary-level students sing music from the twentieth century as well.{{r|lois|page=16}}

Kodály collected, composed, and [[arranged]] a large number of works for pedagogical use{{r|percy|page=83}} Along with [[Béla Bartók]] and other associates, Kodály collected and published six volumes of Hungarian folk music, including over one thousand children’s songs. Much of this literature was used in Kodály method [[song book]]s and [[textbooks]].{{r|lois|page=15}} High quality music was needed in short and simple forms in order to bridge the gap between folk music and classical works.{{r|lois|page=2}} For this purpose, Kodály composed thousands of songs and sight-singing exercises, making up sixteen educational publications, six of which contain multiple volumes of over one hundred exercises each.{{r|eos|page=69}} Kodály’s complete pedagogical works are published collectively by [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] as ''The Kodály Choral Method''.{{r|grove}}

==Results==
Studies have shown that the Kodály method improves [[Intonation (music)|intonation]], rhythm skills, music [[literacy]], and the ability to sing in increasingly complex parts.{{r|devr|page=24}} Outside music, it has been shown to improve perceptual functioning, concept formation, [[motor skills]], and performance in other academic areas such as reading and math.{{r|devr|page=25}}

The third film, ''[[La Leyenda de las Momias|La Leyenda de las Momias de Guanajuato]]'', was released on 30 October 2014 with 700 copies in regular and [[4DX]] formats, a first for a Mexican film.&lt;ref name="el-economista-momias"/&gt; The film is a fictionalization of the origin of the [[mummy|mummies]], notably from the [[Mummies of Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] region. It follows Leo San Juan and his gang now trying to find Xóchitl in [[Guanajuato City|Guanajuato]] who was kidnapped by Rosseau, an old wizard who has the ability to awaken the mummies from the dead. Along the way, Leo teams up with Valentina, disguised as her alter-ego Luis, who is on her own journey to find her father. Director Alberto Rodríguez returns to direct for the second time, and makes his writing debut, alongside with the screenplay by Jesús Guzmán, Ricardo Arnaiz, and Dulce María Guerrero. ''Momias'' was not produced with the support of the Mexican federal government, due to disapproval; however, it did receive support from the state government of [[Guanajuato]].&lt;ref name="el-economista-momias"/&gt; Despite the lack of national support, ''Momias'' is a major box-office success, and the first in the series to surpass $50 million pesos; grossing a total of $92.2 million pesos (US$4.9 million).&lt;ref name="charronegro-taquilla2"/&gt; As the voice cast from ''Llorona'' reunites for the third film, among the newcomers is Benny Emmanuel, known for ''[[La CQ]]'', as the voice of Leo San Juan, who has been the present voice actor for the character since ''Momias''. Alongside, Eduardo "Lalo" España, a Mexican actor and comedian, joins the franchise cast as the new character, Evaristo, an [[alebrije]] with a smooth personality, while Alejandra Müller, a teen actress who is also an alumnus of ''[[La CQ]]'', voices Valentina, a girl who Leo helps find Rosseau.&lt;ref name="mvs-momias"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ánima Estudios estrenará 'La leyenda de las momias de Guanajuato'|url=http://www.mvsnoticias.com/#!/noticias/anima-estudios-estrenara-la-leyenda-de-las-momias-de-guanajuato-736.html|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=MVS Noticas|publisher=MVS Radio|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===La Leyenda del Chupacabras (2016)===
{{further|La Leyenda del Chupacabras}}
''[[La Leyenda del Chupacabras]]'', the fourth film, was released on 21 October 2016.&lt;ref name="economista-anima-leyendas"/&gt; The story is based on the [[chupacabra]] creature. In the film, while on his way home to [[Puebla City|Puebla]], Leo and his fellow rebel mates get caught up in a civil war where they get locked up in [[Irapuato]]. When the 'chupacabra' invades the prison, Leo calls the help of his friend, Teodora, to discover the origin and arrival of the creature as he escapes with his inmates. The films' past characters, including Don Andrés and Xochitl, were left absent, while Fernando "Nando" San Juan, Leo's older brother from ''[[La Leyenda de la Nahuala|Nahuala]]'', makes a return to the franchise. The film also uses [[traditional animation]], which is the first time since ''Nahuala'' and the first during the [[Ánima Estudios]] era. In another series first, the film was released in the [[United States]] on 14 October 2016, one week prior to its release in Mexico. Distributed by [[Pantelion Films]], a major American film distributor for [[Latin America]]n-themed films, the film was shown in the original Spanish-language format with English subtitles.&lt;ref name="univision-chupacabras-us"&gt;{{cite news|title=La leyenda de 'El Chupacabras'|url=http://www.univision.com/entretenimiento/avances/la-leyenda-de-el-chupacabras|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Univision|publisher=Univision Communications Inc.|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving negative reviews, the film is another major box-office success, grossing a total of $100.7 million pesos (US$5.4 million), making it the highest-grossing film in the franchise and currently the only one to surpass the $100 million peso-mark.&lt;ref name="charronegro-taquilla2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="variety-mexico-box-office"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hopewell|first1=John|title=Fewer Juggernauts Push Mexico to All-Time Box Office Record (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/festivals/fewer-juggernauts-mexico-2016-box-office-record-1202010054/|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=Variety (magazine)|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC.|date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Momias'' voice cast return for the fourth film, Rafael Inclán did not return to voice Alebrije, where he was replaced by dubbing actor Herman López.

{{further|La Leyenda del Charro Negro}}
''[[La Leyenda del Charro Negro]]'', the fifth entry, was released on 19 January 2018, as opposed to previous films which were normally released on an October.&lt;ref name="charronegro-taquilla2"/&gt; It picks up from ''[[La Leyenda del Chupacabras|Chupacabras]]'' where Leo San Juan and his brother Nando head home to [[Puebla City|Puebla]]. Along the way, Leo encounters the 'Charro Negro' ("Black Charro") who confuses him and causes a girl to be cast into the underworld.

===Sequels and future of franchise===
While ''Charro Negro'' has been rumored to be the last film in the franchise, director Alberto Rodríguez has stated the possibility of a new film, due to the amount of potential and "many more doors to explore", but would require the creation of new characters.&lt;ref name="videocine-leyenda-ultima"&gt;{{cite news|title=EL CHARRO NEGRO, ¿LA ÚLTIMA LEYENDA?|url=https://videocine.com.mx/noticia/charro-negro-la-ultima-leyenda/|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=Videocine Distrbucion Noticas|publisher=Televisa, S.A. de C.V.|date=2018}} In Spanish. (Note: date not shown on website)&lt;/ref&gt;
Andrés Couturier, the voice of Don Andrés and manager at [[Ánima Estudios]], said that he wouldn't be "surprised to see crossovers or spin-offs of ''Las Leyendas''."&lt;ref name="videocine-leyenda-ultima"/&gt; Rodríguez stated that ''Charro Negro'' would be his last film, as he has expressed interest in making new projects outside of the franchise. "I feel that my cycle is already finished in terms of [''Leyendas'']. I already want to do other things, but we are still involved in the development of other things that come for the ''Leyendas''," he said.&lt;ref name="proceso-charro-negro"/&gt;

It was announced on [[Twitter]] that another installment is confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cinepolis on Twitter: "¡Algo nuevo de @helloanima se está cocinando!

'''Lillian Boyer''' (January 15, 1901 – February 1, 1989) was an American [[wing walker]] who performed numerous aerial stunts that included wing walking, automobile-to-airplane transfers, and parachute jumps between 1921 and 1929.

==Wing walking career==
[[Image:Lillian Boyer doing the breakaway cph.3b18662.jpg|thumb|left|Performing a stunt called the "breakaway"]]

Working as a restaurant waitress but eager to fly in an airplane, in 1921 Lillian Boyer was invited by two restaurant customers to take an airplane ride. On her second flight, she climbed out on the wing thus beginning her career as an aerial performer.&lt;ref&gt;TheHenryFord.org, [http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/heroes/barnstormers/lillianboyer.asp Lillian Boyer, "Empress of the Air" p.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615210633/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/heroes/barnstormers/lillianboyer.asp |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1921, she began a 5-month training with pilot [[William S Brock|Lt. Billy Brock]], former [[World War I]] pilot and [[barnstorming|barnstormer]].&lt;ref&gt;TheHenryFord.org, [http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/heroes/barnstormers/lillianboyer_p2.asp Lillian Boyer, "Empress of the Air" p.2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616045238/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/heroes/barnstormers/lillianboyer_p2.asp |date=2010-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She performed many daring stunts and achieved great public acclaim until 1929 when federal regulations on low flying and unsafe planes forced her and many other barnstormers into retirement.&lt;ref&gt;TheHenryFord.org, [http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/heroes/barnstormers/lillianboyer_p3.asp Lillian Boyer, "Empress of the Air" p.3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619221400/http://hfmgv.org/exhibits/heroes/barnstormers/lillianboyer_p3.asp |date=2010-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her performances included
* 352 shows in 41 US states and Canada, most of them wing-walking
* 143 automobile-to-plane changes
* 37 parachute jumps (13 into [[Lake Erie]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11113">This is an incomplete '''list of comics based on television programs'''. Often a [[television program]] becomes successful, popular or attains cult status and the [[Media franchise|franchise]] produces [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s that often include [[comic]]s.

A number of companies specialise in licensed properties, including [[Gold Key Comics]], [[Dark Horse Comics#Licensed properties|Dark Horse Comics]], [[Titan Books]] and [[Dynamite Entertainment]]. With the bigger series the license can often pass to a number of companies over the history of the title.

==Comics==

'''Sports channels''' are television [[speciality channel]]s (usually available exclusively through [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]]) broadcast sporting events, usually live, and when not broadcasting events, sports news and other related programming.

The first sports channel was from the [[SportsChannel]] networks, which went on the air in 1977 with the original SportsChannel (now [[MSG Plus]]). [[ESPN]] began broadcasting in 1979.  Since then, many channels have surfaced around the world, many focusing on one sport in particular, or one region of a country, showing only their local team's games. These networks have greatly improved the availability of sports broadcasts, generating opportunities such as the ability for one person to see every single game their team plays over the course of the season.

In the United States, these channels broadcast most regular season games of major pro sports league and many other sports as well, with [[Terrestrial television|over the air]] [[television network]]s stepping in during the weekends or special events (all-star games, championships, etc.).

}}
'''Misty''', known as {{Nihongo|'''Kasumi'''|カスミ}} in Japan, is a fictional character in the [[Pokémon]] franchise owned by [[Nintendo]] and created by [[Satoshi Tajiri]]. She has appeared as a [[Pokémon gym|Gym Leader]] in the ''[[Pokémon video game series|Pokémon]]'' video games [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']], [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'' and ''Silver'']], and their [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|respective]] [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|remakes]]. She was a protagonist in the [[Pokémon (anime)|ongoing anime]] for the first five seasons, travelling alongside [[Ash Ketchum]] and [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]] to become the world's best trainer of Water-type Pokémon before departing home to Cerulean City to run the family gym, but made recurring appearances after. The character has also appeared in manga like ''[[Pokémon Adventures]]''. Her Japanese [[voice actress]] is [[Mayumi Iizuka]], while her English voice was supplied by [[Rachael Lillis]] and [[Michele Knotz]].

==Design==
Misty's character design was overseen by [[Ken Sugimori]] and Atsuko Nishida, and for the anime the design was overseen by Sayuri Ichishi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credits|publisher=Pokeani|author=Staff|url=http://pokeani.com/episodefolda/anime-pokemonag.html|accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Japanese voice actress, [[Mayumi Iizuka]], stated that during her audition the director asked her to act like herself, and in doing so she landed the role. As a result, she considers Misty to be the one character she has voiced who most represents herself.&lt;ref name="AX"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ex.org/4.6/07-feature_iizuka.html | title = Press Session: Mayumi Iizuka | publisher = Ex | date = 1999-04-06 | author = Staff | accessdate = 2008-05-02 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511211046/http://www.ex.org/4.6/07-feature_iizuka.html | archivedate = 11 May 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayumi keeps track of her character's promotional appearances in merchandise and other material, additionally providing fans with insights on possible future cameos in the anime series.

==Appearances==

===In the video games===
In the [[Pokémon video game series|video games]] [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'', ''Blue'', ''Yellow'']], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|''FireRed'' &amp; ''LeafGreen'']], [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Pokémon Gold'', ''Silver'']], ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'', [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|''Pokémon HeartGold'' and ''SoulSilver'']], and [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]]. Misty is the Gym Leader of Cerulean City. She specializes in [[Pokémon types#Water-type|Water-type]] Pokémon. Misty, in her anime form, also appears as a trophy in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' and as a gym leader in ''[[Pokémon Puzzle League]]''. Additionally, she appears on ''[[Pokémon Channel]]'' on a full Japanese [[Pichu]] Bros. Disc. The disc differs from the other Japanese disc, as Misty's (Kasumi) voice actor is the [[narrator]]. Misty, as well as most of the gym leaders in Pokémon history, reappear in ''[[Pokémon Black and White#Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|''Pokémon Black 2'' and ''White 2'']]'' as part of the Pokémon World Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=2012 |title=Pokémon Blowout! |journal=''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' |volume= |issue=45 |pages=33 |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the anime===
The anime follows the quest of one of the main characters, [[Ash Ketchum]], as he and his friends travel around the fictitious world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners. Although Misty is the leader of the Cerulean Gym in the games, she left the Gym to her three older sisters prior to traveling with Ash in the anime, although she still retained the title of Gym Leader despite this.&lt;ref name="Waterflowers"&gt;{{cite episode| title =The Waterflowers of Cerulean City| episodelink =| series =Pokémon| serieslink =Pokémon (anime)| credits =Kunihiko Yuyama (Director)| network =Cartoon Network| station =| city =| airdate =| began =| ended =| season =| number =107| minutes =| transcript =Ash: What are you doing here?! // Misty: I'm a gym leader, too! The Fourth Sensational Sister!| transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first comes across Ash when she accidentally fishes him and his [[Pikachu]] out of a river while fishing for water Pokémon. Soon after this incident, Ash "borrows" her [[bicycle|bike]] in an attempt to flee from a flock of wild [[Spearow]]. The bike is later charred by an attack from Pikachu.&lt;ref name="bike"&gt;
{{cite episode| title =Pokémon, I Choose You!| episodelink =| series =Pokémon| serieslink =Pokémon (anime)| credits =Kunihiko Yuyama (Director)| network =Cartoon Network| station =| city =| airdate =| began =| ended =| season =| number =101| minutes =| transcript =| transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misty tells Ash she will not leave him alone until he replaces the bike and commits to follow him on his journey, and the two soon become best friends. After retrieving her repaired bike at the end of the [[Johto]] League Silver Conference, she returns to the Cerulean Gym and resumes her duties as the Gym Leader.

Misty  becomes a central character in ''[[Pokémon Chronicles]]'', a spin-off to the ''Pokémon'' anime, and appears in several specials and episodes. She maintains her friendship with Ash and eventually goes to Hoenn to meet up with him, meeting May and Max, and sees him again when he returns to Pallet following a long stint in Hoenn. She also appeared in an arc composed of at least two episodes of the ''[[List of Pokémon: Sun &amp; Moon episodes|Sun &amp; Moon]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comicbook.com/gaming/2017/08/28/pokemon-anime-brock-misty-returns Brock and Misty Return to the Pokemon Anime] Comicbook.com, Retrieved August 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

All such additions will be removed. For more information, please see this article's talk page or Wikipedia's policies on Original Research, Verifiability, Trivia, and Referencing. Thank you. --&gt;

In the early episodes, Misty is depicted as having a wicked temper, stubborn temperament, and little patience. As the series progresses, however, she gradually shows herself to be kind and sensible. Misty becomes the parental guardian of [[Togepi]], caring for it throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title =Who Gets To Keep Togepi?| episodelink =| series =Pokémon| serieslink =Pokémon (anime)| credits =Hiroshi Sakai (Director)| network =Cartoon Network| station =| city =| airdate =| began =| ended =| season =| number =150| minutes =| transcript =| transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misty constantly reins in [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]] when he becomes enamored with pretty girls, often pulling him away by the ear. She is also terrified of most [[Pokémon types#Bug-type|Bug-type Pokémon]]. Misty aims to be a world-class [[Pokémon types#Water-type|Water-type]] [[Pokémon trainer]] despite her sisters' ridicule. Misty is also an [[orphan]], with her parents having abandoned her and her sisters at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;''Pocket Monsters the Animation''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printed adaptations===
The Misty that appears in the ''[[Pokémon: The Electric Tale of Pikachu|Electric Tale of Pikachu]]'' [[manga]] series, which is loosely based on the anime, is similar to the Misty in the anime, while the Misty in ''[[Pokémon Adventures]]'' is similar to the Misty in the video games. She appears throughout ''Electric Tale of Pikachu'', traveling on occasion with Ash. In ''[[Pokémon Adventures]]'', Misty is still a stubborn tomboy who trains Water Pokémon and has three siblings, Daisy, Lily and Violet, who are not mentioned. When [[List of Pokémon Adventures characters#Red|Red]], the protagonist of the manga, first meets her, she is trying to recapture her Gyarados with help of her Staryu, which has been brainwashed by [[Team Rocket (anime)|Team Rocket]]. They decide to team up and confront Team Rocket. The next morning, after spending the night resting in Misty's mansion, Misty leads Red to her Gym and reveals herself to be the Gym Leader. They have a battle, and though Misty quickly gained the upper hand and easily defeated Red with her fast and strong Starmie, she is worried that if they do not prepare themselves, Team Rocket will defeat them easily. Red decides that he might actually need training, and agrees to train. At that point, they become close friends.

In ''[[Pokémon Pocket Monsters]]'', Red, the protagonist of the series, is seeking a Moon Stone along with his Pikachu and his Clefairy (one that speaks human language). When they meet Misty, Clefairy notices that she is wearing a Moon Stone as a necklace. Misty declares that they battle her if they wish to have it. While the Clefairy is initially pumped up to battle, he quickly changes his mind when he sees that his opponent is a massive [[Blastoise]]. After a while, the battle is won when Clefairy sucks up all the water in a nearby river and releases the water onto Misty's Pokémon, sending it flying into the sky. Just when Misty is about to reward Red's group with the prize they sought, the stone is stolen.

==Critical reception==
The book ''The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture'' described Misty's portrayal in the anime as a mother figure, calling her a "nurturing component" for the original trio of herself, Ash and Brock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture |last=West |first=Mark I. |year=2008 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8108-5121-0 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; It further described her as an "unusually 'complete' girl of the cartoon world", noting both her feminine sentimentality and her "explosive rage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Japanification of Children's Popular Culture |last=West |first=Mark I. |year=2008 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=0-8108-5121-0 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces'' praised the character as being "particularly nuanced" and described her as contributing heavily to the series' appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anime Classics Zettai!: 100 Must-See Japanese Animation Masterpieces |page=283 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |date=May 2007 |author=Camp, Brian |author2=Julie Davis  |isbn=978-1-933330-22-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon'' stated that though the anime focused on Ash, Misty was a distinctly significant character especially to young female consumers, neither "[[Butch and femme|butch]]" nor "dizzily feminine", seemingly "carefully constructed to appeal to preadolescent girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|page=21|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It added that, unlike other aggressive female characters in the series, Misty did not sacrifice her femininity to succeed, making the character further popular with young American women, a contrast to Japanese children who focused more on the individual Pokémon species to identify with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=231–232, 282|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies on the reactions boys and girls had to the concept of Misty as a heroine in the series, girls accepted it and were eager to associate themselves with the character,&lt;ref name="hero"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katch|first=Jane|title=They Don't Like Me: Lessons on Bullying and Teasing from a Preschool Classroom|year=2004|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-2321-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while boys attempted to belittle her efforts.&lt;ref name="hero"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|page=176|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, children of both genders felt the character alongside Brock gave Ash a sense of identity and moral support, which researchers attributed to the concept of group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=169–170, 177|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, children were shown to associate the attributes of attractiveness and aggressiveness, while college students described the character as romantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ogletree, Shirley M. |date=28 October 2004 |title=Pokémon: Exploring the Role of Gender |journal=Sex Roles |volume=50| issue = 11–12 / June, 2004 |pages=851–859 |publisher= |location=Springer Netherlands |issn=0360-0025 |doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000029102.66384.a2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pikachu's Global Adventure'' additionally stated Misty also served as a source of non-threatening sexuality for both older and younger male viewers, though the context of such was presented in a more subtle way for North American localizations of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=284|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, nearing Halloween, [[Archie Comics]] writer Ryan Jampole utilized Misty as one of the 31 costumes for the character [[List of Mega Man characters#Roll|Roll]] from the Archie Comics adaptation of the Mega Man franchise.&lt;ref name="Misty Roll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themmnetwork.com/blog/2013/10/31/31-days-of-halloween-costumed-roll-by-ryan-jampole |title=31 Days of Halloween Costumed Roll by Ryan Jampole - TheMMNetwork |publisher=themmnetwork.com |date=2013-10-31 |accessdate=2014-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5222">'''Music hall songs''' were sung in the [[music halls]] by a variety of artistes. Most of them were comic in nature. There are a very large number of music hall songs, and most of them have been forgotten.

Retrieved 13 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'''35 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] (1927–1934)'''
: The Onyx Club opened in 1927 at 35 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] as a [[speakeasy]] by [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] Joe Helbock ''(né'' Joseph Jerome Helbock; 1896–1973).&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8DDMwc0LJNgC&amp;pg=PA52 52nd Street, The Street of Jazz,]'' [[Arnold Shaw (author)|Arnold Shaw]], [[Da Capo Press]] (1977) {{OCLC|3002082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''72 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] (1934–1937)'''
: In February of 1934, after the end of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], the Onyx Club became an authorized club in a new location — 72 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]].  The Onyx featured musicians that included the [[Spirits of Rhythm]] and [[Art Tatum]], who then was the regular intermission pianist.  It burned down in 1935.  Helbock rebuilt it and reopened it July 13, 1935, and reopened with [[Red McKenzie]], [[Stuff Smith]], [[Jonah Jones]], [[John Kirby (musician)|John Kirby]], [[Maxine Sullivan]], and others.

'''62 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] (1937–1939)'''
: It moved to 62 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] and closed in 1939, due partly to a fallout with a silent partner, guitarist [[Carl Kress]].

'''57 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] (1942–1949)'''
: In 1942, a new Onyx Club, unrelated to the original, opened at 57 [[52nd Street (Manhattan)|West 52nd Street]] and flourished as a jazz venue featuring [[Art Tatum]], [[Red Allen]], [[Cozy Cole]], [[Roy Eldridge]], [[Ben Webster]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]].  The owners included Irving Alexander (1908–1987), Jack A. Colt (1905–1970), Mac Rosen, Arthur Jarwood (1907–1998), and Chauncey Samuel Olman (1908–1965).  The group, at varying degrees, was involved in the ownership of [[Kelly's Stables (New York)|Kelly's Stable]], Downbeat, Three Deuces, and the Door.&lt;ref name="Shaw" /&gt;  Olman, an attorney for musicians and composers, was the brother of band leader Val Olman (1913–2006).  The venue, under the same name, became a [[strip club]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Guinness Jazz"&gt;''Jazz, A–Z,'' by [[Peter Clayton]] and [[Peter Gammond]], [[Guinness Superlatives]] (1986) {{OCLC|15353474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Plague Over England''''' is a play written by [[Nicholas de Jongh]], based on a real-life incident when actor [[John Gielgud]] was arrested for lewd behavior in 1953; it provides an insight into the changes in the lives of gay people over the last fifty years. It received universally positive reviews when it received its world premiere at the [[Finborough Theatre]] in 2008, and subsequently transferred to the West End with an updated cast for a limited run.

==Plot summary==
On 21 October 1953, [[John Gielgud]] was arrested in a public lavatory after being entrapped by a "pretty policeman". There followed a high-profile court case, reenacted in ''Plague Over England''.

==Productions==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plague Over England Bill Board.JPG|thumb|left|Plague Over England at the Duchess Theatre]] --&gt;
The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic Nicholas de Jongh's first play premiered at the [[Finborough Theatre]] in February 2008, and transferred to the West End's [[Duchess Theatre]] in February 2009, with [[Michael Feast]] as Gielgud and [[Celia Imrie]] as [[Sybil Thorndike]]. It included the following cast: Michael Brown, [[David Burt]], [[Simon Dutton]], Steven Hansell, [[Sam Heughan]], [[Hugh Ross (actor)|Hugh Ross]] and [[John Warnaby]]. It was directed by [[Tamara Harvey]].

==Reception==
The production received largely positive reviews, many particularly praising Imrie and Feast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/plague-over-england-duchess-theatre-londonbron-the-waterfront-theatre-royal-london-1634552.html |title=Plague Over England, Duchess Theatre, London |first=Claudia |last=Pritchard |date=1 March 2009 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite rave reviews, the production closed two weeks early on 2 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londontheatre.co.uk/londontheatre/news/ma09/plagueoverengland333129.htm |title=Plague Over England to close two weeks early on 2 May |date=1 April 2009 |website=London Theatre.co.uk |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatretickets.co.uk/theatre-news/85/Plague+Over+England+Comes+To+An+End.html |title=Plague Over England Comes To An End |website=Theatre Tickets.co.uk |date=15 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422075251/http://www.theatretickets.co.uk/theatre-news/85/Plague+Over+England+Comes+To+An+End.html |archivedate=22 April 2012 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Red Bull Romaniacs,''' is an [[enduro]] [[off-road]] [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle race]] run annually in [[Romania]]. It was created in 2004 by founder Martin Freinademetz. The Red Bull Romaniacs takes place every year (around July) and attracts riders from more than 40 countries. The race is spread over five days, the first being the inner-city prologue. The four “Offroad race days” takes place on Enduro trails in the region around [[Sibiu]]. (Southern [[Romanian Carpathians|Carpathian Mountains]]).

[[File:Graham Jarvis, Red Bull Romaniacs 2016.jpg|thumb|Graham Jarvis, aka "King of the Carpathians", 6 -time winner of the Red Bull Romaniacs]]

The Red Bull Romaniacs is part of the Red Bull Hard Enduro Series, together with Red Bull Minas Riders, Brazil (April), Erzberg Rodeo, Austria (June), Red Bull Romaniacs, Romania (July), Red Bull Megawatt, Poland (September), Red Bull Sea to Sky, Turkey (October), Roof of Africa, South Africa (December). In 2018 it will join the World Enduro Super Series.

==The rally==
Rally organizer Martin Freinademetz had the idea for an enduro rally in the region after he saw the|Carpathian Mountains that surround the historic [[Transylvania]]n city of Sibiu.&lt;ref name=org&gt;[http://www.redbullromaniacs.com/start/the-organizers/ The Organizers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Bull Romaniacs are organized under the patronage of the Romanian National Tourism Authority.

==Prologue==
The prologue stage of Red Bull Romaniacs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redbullromaniacs.com/start/the-prolog/ The Prolog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is always held on the "Bulevard Coposu", one of the main streets in the city center of Sibiu and moves onto the nearby rocky mountain sides and thick forests where the competitors have to prove their endurance and riding skills. A different course is set every year with different obstacles for competitors to race over.

==Off-road==
The track crosses mountain areas, rocky ground, hills and valleys; tarmac is avoided as much as possible. The length varies between 100&amp;nbsp;km and 180&amp;nbsp;km each day depending on the class that the competitor enters.&lt;ref name=RBR&gt;{{cite web|title=The Red Bull Romaniacs Rallye|url=http://www.redbullromaniacs.com/start/the-red-bull-romaniacs-rallye/|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main challenges are the technical parts, which lead through wooded areas, where competitors are challenged with natural terrain obstacles, they traverse over trees, rocks, mud, and mountains.&lt;ref name=RBR/&gt; Petrol fuel stops, or tank stops, are placed at intervals of approximately 70&amp;nbsp;km, where contestants refuel their motorcycles and have the opportunity to refresh themselves.

The track is marked with banners, signs and colored markings, and is loaded onto a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] in order to guarantee safety. There are also specially designed spectator points.

==List of winners==
[[Graham Jarvis (motorcyclist)|Graham Jarvis]] is the most successful rider in the event's history with six overall wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham Jarvis wins Red Bull Romaniacs 2017|url=https://www.redbull.com/us-en/red-bull-romaniacs-2017-graham-jarvis-final-win|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wayang Kulit of Semar.jpg|thumb|A [[Wayang|shadow puppet]] representing Semar]]
'''Semar''' is a character in [[Java]]nese mythology who frequently appears in [[wayang]] shadow plays. He is one of the [[punokawan]] (clowns), but is in fact divine and very wise. He is the [[Hyang|dhanyang]] (guardian spirit) of Java,&lt;ref name="G23"&gt;Geertz, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded by some as the most sacred figure of the [[wayang]] set.&lt;ref name="H144"&gt; Holt, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to be the god [[Sang Hyang Ismaya]] in human form.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Budihardja, "Grepen uit de Wajang," ''Djawa'' II (1922), 22-23; cited in Holt, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Semar is said to derive from the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] word ''samar'' ("dim, obscure, mysterious").&lt;ref name="B"/&gt; He is often referred to with the honorific,  "Kyai Lurah Semar" ("the venerable chief").&lt;ref name="B"/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten wajang topengmasker voorstellende Semar TMnr 1886-4.jpg|thumb|Mask of Semar for traditional Javanese theater performance.]]
In depictions, Semar appears with a flat nose, a protruding lower jaw, a tired eye, and bulging rear, belly, and chest. He wears a checkered hipcloth, symbolizing sacredness. Like the other panakawan, the [[Wayang#Wayang kulit|wayang kulit]] puppet does not have the elaborate openwork and ornamentation characteristic of the heroes&lt;ref name="H144"/&gt; In [[wayang wong]], Semar always leans forward, one hand palm up on his back and the other extended partly forward, moving up and down, with an extended forefinger.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

By tradition Semar has three sons, the other punakawans in the wayang: Gareng, Petruk, and Bagong (Bagong does not appear in [[Surakarta]]-style wayang).&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In some wayangs, he has a brother Togog (or Hyang Antaga), who is the servant-clown of a demonic hero.&lt;ref name="H145"&gt;Holt, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Semar Kris (alt) 3.jpg|thumb|A decorative [[kris]] with a figure of Semar as the handle]]
As Semar is one of the few characters in wayang stories not from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]], his origin is obscure. One hypothesis is that he and his sons are old indigenous deities who became cursed and demoted to servants with the importation of the [[kshatriya]] heroes of the Indian epics.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kats, "Wie is Semar?" ''Djawa'' III (1923), 55; cited in Holt, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Semar also resembles the [[vidusaka]] clown figure of Indian Sanskrit drama.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ''known'' appearance of Semar is during the [[Majapahit]] era. In 1358 in relief of Sudamala in Candi TIgamangi, and in [[Candi Sukuh]] dated 1439. The relief was copied from a wayang story from the period, where Semar was first known to be appeared. &lt;ref&gt;Khoon, 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stories==
In one version of the [[Babad Tanah Jawi]] (the Javanese creation myth), Semar cultivated a small rice field near [[Mount Merbabu]] for ten thousand years before there were any men. His descendents, the spirits of the island, came into conflict with people as they cleared fields and populated the island. A powerful  priest, unable to deviate from his king's orders to continue cultivating the island, provided Semar with a role that will allow his children and grandchildren to stay. Semar's role was to be a spiritual advisor and magical supporter of the royalty, and those of his descendents who also protect the humans of Java can remain there.&lt;ref name="G23"/&gt;

One genealogy of Semar is that he is the eldest descendent of [[God]], and elder brother to [[Batara Guru]], king of the other gods; however, Semar became a man.&lt;ref name="G276"&gt;Geertz, 276.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another genealogy says that he is the son of [[Adam and Eve]]. His brother Nabi ("prophet") Sis gave birth to various prophets, such as [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]], from whom the various Western peoples are descended, while Semar ("Sayang Sis") gave birth to the Hindus and the Javanese.&lt;ref name="G276"/&gt; In either case Semar, in his awkward, ugly human form, represents at the same time god and clown, the most spiritually refined and outwardly rough.&lt;ref name="G276"/&gt;

==Use in wayang==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Houten wajangpop voorstellend Semar TMnr 8-73.jpg|thumb|[[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] wayang adaptation of Semar.]]
Semar and his sons first appear in the second part of the plays (''[[pathet sanga]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; as the servants and counselors of whoever the hero of the wayang play is.&lt;ref&gt;Frits A. Wagner, ''Indonesia: The Art of an Island Group''. New York: Crown Publishers, 1959; 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In wayang plots Semar is never mistaken, and is deceptively powerful. He is the only character who dares to protest to the gods, including Batara Guru ([[Shiva]]) and [[Durga|Batari Durga]], and even compel them to act or desist.&lt;ref name="H145"/&gt;

He often represents the realistic view of the world in contrast to the idealistic. His role as servant is to cheer up those in despair and blunt the pride of the triumphant. [[Clifford Geertz]] compared his role vis-à-vis [[Arjuna]] to that of [[Henry V of England|Prince Hal]] with his father in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, Part I|Henry IV]]'', and his role as critic of the play's worldview and antidote to pride as similar to [[Falstaff]].&lt;ref name="G277"&gt;Geertz, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has also been suggested that Semar is a symbol of the peasantry, not otherwise incorporated in the palace hierarchies; that in some more popular forms of the drama, he and the other clowns dominate the royal heroes supports this idea.&lt;ref name="G277"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.O., "Petroek als Vorst," ''Djawa'', III (1922), 169-172; cited in Holt, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other appearances==
Semar also appears on some ceremonial weapons, the [[pusaka]] of some important families. In this role he represents an ancestral figure.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a low rectangular [[candi of Indonesia|candi]] on the [[Dieng Plateau]] known as [[Candi Semar]], perhaps originally a treasury,&lt;ref&gt;Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, ''History of Indian and Indonesian Art'', New York: Dover, 1985, 202.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is generally assumed by scholars that its name was given to the temple centuries after its erection.&lt;ref&gt;Holt, 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Bali, the counterpart of Semar is [[Twalen]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeune Scott-Kemball, ''Javanese Shadow Puppets: The [[Stamford Raffles|Raffles]] Collection in the [[British Museum]]'', Trustees of the British Museum, 1970, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Storm Clouds Cantata''''' (or'' Storm Cloud Cantata'') is a [[chorale]] by the Australian composer [[Arthur Benjamin]].
[[File:RoyalAlbertHall.jpg|300px | thumb | The Royal Albert Hall, the scene of the "Storm Clouds Cantata" in the 1934 version]]

This chorale was written for the assassination scene in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] 1934 film, ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'', in the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. In the film version of 1934, the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] was directed by [[H. Wynn Reeves]]. In [[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|the 1956 version]], however, the London Symphony Orchestra was conducted by the composer of new music for the remake of the film, [[Bernard Herrmann]], and the chorus is the [[Covent Garden Opera Chorus]] with  soloist [[Barbara Howitt]].

The Cantata can be from eight to nine minutes long. It starts with a ''[[Tempo|Lento]]'' in [[three-quarter time]] in [[C major]]. The first half of the chorale is ''[[Tempo|Lento]]'', at 108 beats per minute. Then begins the ''[[Allegro agitato]]'', characterized by rhythmic strokes of the timpani. The conclusion is very fast both in the chorus and in the orchestra.

==Orchestra==

* Flute

* Tenor Trombone

* Harp
* Organ

* Cello
* Contrabasses
* Mezzo-soprano solo

==Text ==
[[D. B. Wyndham-Lewis]], ''The Man who Knew Too Much''

'''Soloist''':
&lt;poem&gt;There came a whispered terror on the breeze.
And the dark forest shook&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Chorus''':
&lt;poem&gt;And on the trembling trees came nameless fear.
And panic overtook each flying creature of the wild&lt;/poem&gt;
:Original: ''...flying creature of the wind''
&lt;poem&gt;And when they all had fled&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Soloist''':
&lt;poem&gt;All save the child — all save the child.
Around whose head screaming,
The night-birds wheeled and shoot away.&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Chorus''':
&lt;poem&gt;Finding release from that which drove them onward like their prey.
Finding release the storm-clouds broke.
And drowned the dying moon.
The storm-clouds broke — the storm clouds broke.
Finding release!&lt;/poem&gt;

===Addition for the 1956 remake===
&lt;poem&gt;Yet stood the trees — yet stood the trees
Around whose heads screaming&lt;/poem&gt;

The singers perform in an alternation between male and female:
&lt;poem&gt;Finding release;
Finding release from that which drove them onward like their prey.&lt;/poem&gt;

This last part is part of the ''poco crescendo'' played by the [[Timpani|Tympani]] to culminate in the ''[[Maestoso]]'' in the finale which ends with the [[cymbal]] crash in which the assassin shoots.

==Publication==
The full score of the Storm Clouds Cantata has never been published.  A piano reduction of the latter half of the work was published in 2014 in the collection ''Music From the Hitchcock Films''.&lt;ref&gt;''Music from the Hitchcock Films'', arrangements by Christopher Hussey, Jeremy Birchall, and Jane Watkins, edited by Jenni Norey, London: Wise Publications, 2014. {{isbn|9781783056064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7988">'''Syrnet''' is a [[Syria]]n [[pirate radio|pirate]] [[radio network]] launched in September 2013 to broadcast information to citizens that is suppressed or manipulated by state-run media.&lt;ref name=morningedition/&gt;&lt;ref name=qantara/&gt; It was developed by [[Germany]]-based [[non-profit organization]] Media in Cooperation and Transition (MiCT), with funding provided by the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Office]]. {{as of|2015|12}}, there are nine studios producing content in different parts of the country.&lt;ref name=deutschlandfunk/&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Media coverage of the Syrian Civil War}}

Syrian president [[Bashar Assad]] has repeatedly sabotaged or exerted control over communications infrastructure, disabling Internet, phone networks, and even electricity.&lt;ref name=local/&gt; The media that is accessible is often created by or filtered by the Syrian government, which makes frequent use of [[propaganda]] and [[misinformation]].&lt;ref name=watson/&gt;

Radio, as an analog technology, is more difficult than the Internet and phone networks to shut down. It also requires less physical infrastructure and its use is less dependent on a functional electric grid.&lt;ref name=morningedition/&gt;&lt;ref name=local/&gt; For these reasons radio is a common medium among resistance and other independent groups. Some Syrians have had access to Western-operated external broadcasts prior to Syrnet, but those stations have typically operated outside of the country, leaving a scarcity of coverage of the most immediate and important news stories.&lt;ref name=qantara/&gt;
[[File:Syrnet relay 4.jpg|thumb|left|A Syrnet relay antenna]]

==Operations==
Syrnet comprises nine geographically separated studios inside Syria's borders, {{as of|lc=y|2015|12}}. Two are in locations controlled by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS), having begun broadcasting prior to the area being taken over.&lt;ref name=deutschlandfunk/&gt;&lt;ref name=stlouis/&gt;&lt;ref name=time/&gt; The multiple operational centers allow for local news and announcements and ensures that a disruption to one or two does not lead to a shutdown of production. The broadcast feed is a combination of local content created at the nine studios with external broadcasts, ensuring as many Syrians as possible have access to reports from outside as well as from parts of the country where the situation may be very different.&lt;ref name=qantara/&gt;&lt;ref name=deutschlandfunk/&gt;&lt;ref name=nieman/&gt; For those with Internet access, and in order to spread the content more widely, broadcasts are also made available for download on the Web.&lt;ref name=nieman/&gt;

MiCT employs a number of professional journalists to assist the local stations and reporters.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Technical basis==
[[File:Pocket FM.jpg|thumb|Pocket FM, a portable radio transmitter]]
{{main|Pocket FM}}

The original plan for Syrnet called for standard 1–1.5 kilowatt relay antennas to broadcast over sizable parts of the country. The financial and practical challenges associated with their installation, maintenance, and operation led MiCT to explore the deployment of a larger number of small transmitters rather than small number of large ones, eventually leading to the development of [[Pocket FM]].

Pocket FM is a small, portable [[radio transmitter]] developed by MiCT in collaboration with Germany-based design firm IXDS.&lt;ref name=local/&gt;&lt;ref name=ixds/&gt; Due to its small size and design, it looks more like a [[Radio receiver|receiver]] than a transmitter, making it more difficult to detect, sabotage, or hijack, and much cheaper to run.&lt;ref name=nieman/&gt; {{as of|2016|01}} Syrnet operates through twelve Pocket FM transmitters, each of which is capable of reaching up to six kilometers, and five larger relays.&lt;ref name=nieman/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The Pocket FM units, which can run on [[solar power]] or an automobile's 12-volt battery, are equipped with built-in satellite receivers to pick up the Syrnet feed and broadcast it over-the-air.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

MiCT collaborates with Syrian activists, journalists, and logistical experts to bring the devices into the country.&lt;ref name=nieman/&gt;

==Programming==
Syrnet airs a blend of content produced in the area around the station, created by stations in other parts of the country, and external programming. Broadcasts include information about the opening and closing of borders, the status of refugees and asylum policies, market prices, regional status updates, and even some entertainment.&lt;ref name=deutschlandfunk/&gt;&lt;ref name=stlouis/&gt;

Contributions to Syrnet are evaluated to ensure they meet journalistic standards. The organization is committed to moderate opposition and avoids providing a platform for extremists on any side.&lt;ref name=morningedition/&gt;&lt;ref name=deutschlandfunk/&gt;&lt;ref name=stlouis/&gt;

[[File:TheBoyByGermaineGreer.jpg|thumb|Cover released in Europe as simply "The Boy" was viewed as less explicit.]]
'''''The Beautiful Boy''''' (or just '''''The Boy'''''&lt;ref&gt;Depending upon the edition the cover shows the title to be "The Boy" or "The Beautiful Boy", as do booksellers&lt;/ref&gt;) is a book by [[Germaine Greer]], published in 2003.  Its avowed intention was "to advance women's reclamation of their capacity for and right to visual pleasure".  It is a study of the youthful male face and form, from antiquity to the present day, from paintings and drawings to statuary and photographs.

The cover picture caused minor controversy when the subject of the photograph, [[Björn Andrésen]], a Swedish actor and musician who played Tadzio in ''[[Death in Venice (film)|Death in Venice]]'' (billed by the director [[Luchino Visconti]] as "the most beautiful boy in the world") stated in the press that he objected to the picture having been used without his permission.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/gender/story/0,11812,1063884,00.html 'The Guardian:'  comments following use of Andrésen's picture on the cover of "The Boy"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/17/1066364482598.html?from=storyrhs 'Fairfax Digital:' "I'm not Greer's play toy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains some 200 pictures of boys through the ages, and is a history of boys in art.  Pictures and discussions range from [[Cupid]] to [[Elvis]], [[Boy George]], [[Kurt Cobain]], and [[Jim Morrison]].

The book generated some controversy because "society is not accustomed to seeing beauty in young males", Greer claims. Greer has described the book as  "full of pictures of 'ravishing' pre-adult boys with hairless chests, wide-apart legs and slim waists". She goes on to say that, "I know that the only people who are supposed to like looking at pictures of boys are a subgroup of gay men," she wrote in London's ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]''. "Well, I'd like to reclaim for women the right to appreciate the short-lived beauty of boys, real boys, not simpering 30-year-olds with shaved chests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/09/1057430278896.html |title=Generation of taboo breakers are a selfish lot |accessdate=2007-09-09 |date=2003-07-10 |last=Devine |first=Miranda |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |quote=She wouldn't say exactly how young the "boys" are in her book but has cheerily admitted it will "get me into a lot of trouble" and expects she will be called a pedophile.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was criticized for these comments with some writers labeling her a paedophile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/26/1067103267287.html?from=storyrhs |title=Sticks and stones may break bones but not stereotypes |accessdate=2007-09-09 |date=2003-10-23 |last=Young |first=Emma |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |quote=The knee-jerk response to an older woman writing of her appreciation of semi-naked boys has elicited accusations of pedophilia. The delayed response should be a more mild questioning of why a woman who has passionately railed against the exploitation of the female body has identified the reversal of the gender roles in this same scenario of objectification as feminist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germaine Greer responded vigorously on [[Andrew Denton]]'s television talk show ''Enough Rope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s946782.htm |title=Enough Rope |author=Andrew Denton |publisher=[[ABC Television|ABC TV]] |date=2003-09-15 |accessdate=2008-02-09 |quote=Andrew Denton: There are those who say — have already said in print — that what you're doing is creepy. It's no different to an old man staring at a young girl and lusting after them.&lt;br /&gt;Germaine Greer: (CHUCKLES) Well, you can't stop the old man staring at the young girl and lusting. What are you going to do — tell old men that they must be blindfold or something? I don't think that's particularly creepy as long as they understand that they're not…they have no right to lay hands on that person. But you can't stop them. How could you? I mean, the luminous figure of a beautiful young girl walking down the street and the old men sitting on the wall, leaning on their sticks. What are you going to say? "Look the other way, you dreadful old bastards"? What are you going to say? It's part of the joy of life is admiring the beauty of things that are beautiful. What is important to me about the Boy is that once upon a time his beauty was understood and celebrated by people of both sexes. A boy was allowed to dress in very bright colours, he was allowed to show himself off in the street, he dyed his hair, he wore make-up, he wore a little cap tipped over his eye with a big feather in, he wore tight pants and cropped jackets and so on. And the girls looked down from behind their jalousie and talked about the best-looking boys.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik-Yak''''', original title '''''Gwendoline''''', is a 1984 [[Cinema of France|French]] [[action comedy]]/[[sexploitation|sexploitation film]] directed by [[Just Jaeckin]], written by Jaeckin and [[John Willie]] and starring [[Tawny Kitaen]] and [[Brent Huff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/37751/The-Perils-of-Gwendoline-in-the-Land-of-the-Yik-Yak/overview|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film is loosely based on the [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]]-themed [[comic book|comics]] of Willie and on the character of [[Sweet Gwendoline|Gwendoline]]. [[François Schuiten]] worked as a graphic designer for the movie.

== Plot ==
Captured by a trio of thieves at a Chinese port, Gwendoline (Kitaen), a courageous but naïve girl, is sold to a local casino-brothel owner, but, rescued by Willard (Huff), a mercenary adventurer, she is reunited with her maid, Beth ([[Isabelle Breitman|Zabou]]), after the latter's abduction by the same thieves who had earlier kidnapped Gwendoline. Hired to transport an illegal cargo, Willard reluctantly agrees to take both women with him after Beth, withholding information vital to his livelihood, promises to divulge it only if he becomes their guide. Gwendoline, who has come to China to capture the butterfly that eluded her father, who had staked his professional reputation as a scientist on obtaining the insect, offers Willard $2,000 to take her and Beth with him to the land of the Yik-Yak, in which the butterfly may be found.

After escaping from the cannibal tribe of Kiops, the trio find the butterfly, but, as she is about to capture it, Beth is captured and Gwendoline and Willard must enter an all-women tribe's underground lair to rescue the maid. The tribe is the vestige of the city of Pikaho, a primary diamond mining centre, which was swallowed by a volcanic eruption in the 12th century. Afterwards, the entire male population perished due to a disease spread by the eruption, and Pikaho turned into an all-women society considered nothing more than a legend. To ensure the survival of Pikaho, its Queen ([[Bernadette Lafont]]) allows a victor among them to mate with any man who visits or is captured by the tribe. Aided by Beth and the Queen's henchman,D'Arcy (Jean Rougerie), Gwendoline, disguised as a Pikaho warrior, wins this right.

As she has sex with Willard, D'Arcy activates the volcano and he, the Queen, and citizens of Pikaho are killed as Gwendoline, Beth, and Willard escape. In the process, Willard is able to capture the elusive butterfly.

'''VideoCipher''' is a brand name of analog scrambling and de-scrambling equipment for [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television]] invented primarily to enforce [[Television receive-only]] (TVRO) satellite equipment to only receive TV programming on a subscription basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=scrambledsig The Museum of Broadcast Communications, SCRAMBLED SIGNALS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second version of Videocipher, Videocipher II, was the primary encryption scheme used by major cable TV programmers to prevent TVRO owners from receiving free [[terrestrial television]] programming.  It was especially notable due to the widespread compromise of its encryption scheme.

== Background ==
Videocipher was invented in 1983 by [[Linkabit]] Corporation (later bought out by [[M/A-COM]] in 1985, operated as M/A-COM Linkabit). In the mid 1980s, M/A-COM began divesting divisions which fell outside their core RF &amp; Microwave component and subsystem products.  The Linkabit division was acquired by [[General Instrument]] in 1987.

In the mid 1980s HBO, Cinemax and several other cable providers were facing an uphill battle trying to prevent owners of TVRO equipment from viewing what were at the time free [[Free-to-air|over the air]] signals. In an effort to prevent a growing number of homes from viewing the channels for free, HBO in January 1986, decided to begin scrambling their satellite signals.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite magazine

Videocipher was used throughout the 1990s by [[RCTI]] and [[SCTV (Indonesia)|SCTV]] to encrypt some foreign programs (such as sports events and movies) as part of the term of their rights, to prevent overseas access so that the programs could only be accessed through the RCTI and SCTV networks via UHF/VHF frequency in [[Indonesia]]. [[Indovision]] also used Videocipher to encrypt their channels as a counteract against piracy between 1994 and 1997.

== Variants ==

There are several variants of the Videocipher scrambling system:

=== Videocipher I ===

This was the first version of the Videocipher system that was first demonstrated by Linkabit in 1983.

Also known as Videocipher IB, this variation on Videocipher was commonly used by sports [[backhaul (TV industry)|backhaul]]s. [[CBS]] used this system from 1987 to the mid-1990s to encrypt its transmissions to affiliates on the [[Telstar 301]] and [[Telstar 302]] satellites.

In Canada, the [[CTV television network]] also used this technology on its network feeds. With this system the video is scrambled by means of re-ordering the video scan lines, while all audio remains in the clear. This system was in use as late as the early 2000s.

Videocipher I (VCI) system was initially considered for use by HBO in the 1980s. HBO tested VCI extensively, but was ultimately rejected in favor of Videocipher II. HBO's use of VCI would have required descramblers for home satellite viewers. Due to costs involved with VC1, maintaining VCI a descrambler was determined to be too expensive for consumer use.

[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in the USA used VideoCipher I on its satellite feeds to its member stations in the mid-80s to take advantage of the high-fidelity digital audio capability offered by VCI.  This was desirable for some of the programming PBS would air in that era, such as classical concerts and other musical programming, some of which were simulcast by partnering public radio stations using the same audio feed.  PBS had attempted in 1979 to send its program audio digitally to its member stations using a system called DATE (Digital Audio for TElevision),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | date = July 1979
 
 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/5322034/hot-date-pbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used the existing analog video's [[vertical blanking interval]] (VBI) to send digital audio.  VCI provided this same feature while freeing up the VBI for other purposes like [[closed-captioning]] and [[teletext]], making DATE obsolete by the mid-1980s (however, DATE did offer 4 channels of audio as opposed to VideoCipher I's 2-channel stereo).

The [[Leitch Technology|Leitch]] Viewguard scrambling system used for satellite feeds as well used the same video line re-ordering as well, while also leaving the audio intact. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] used Viewguard as well on their analog network feeds to their affiliate stations shortly before switching to digital satellite distribution in 2005 (for ABC) and 2004 (for Fox).

=== Videocipher II ===
[[File:VideoCipher back.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Back of a 1992 Toshiba satellite receiver with an installed VideoCipher II module]]

Videocipher II was the first consumer TVRO scrambling system. It began testing in 1985 on HBO satellite transponders on [[Satcom 3R]] and [[Galaxy 1]] and entered full use in January 1986 by [[HBO]] and sister channel [[Cinemax]], and within two years was used by a majority of major [[cable television]] programmers. However, lapses in its security enabled some [[pirate decryption]], modifying the descrambler to receive free programming. Beginning in 1991, programmers began to phase out the VCII system in favor of the highly secure Videocipher II Plus (RS) system. The system was fully phased out in 1993. Originally sold as a stand-alone decoder box that consisted of a fully electronic decoder and descrambler module, other satellite system manufacturers began to manufacturer their receivers with the GI descrambler module installed. This VCII system digitally encrypts stereo audio using the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] encryption scheme and scrambles video by inverting the video polarity and moving color information to a nonstandard area frequency.  It is noteworthy that the Videocipher II Plus design did not alter the video scrambling scheme (only the audio encryption was improved).  As such, a Videocipher II decoder is still capable of decoding the video portion of a Videocipher II Plus encrypted stream.  In the late eighties and early nineties, VideoCipher II modules that had been pirated, began to receive constant Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).

In the early nineties, programmers increased the frequency of the top tier DES keys from monthly to near daily.  Companies (such as Magna Systems) began offering services whereby users could continue to receive keys via fax electronic modifications/add-on boards such as "VMS" modems.  These add-on modem modules would dial into a [[bulletin board system]] and automatically download the required keys to view all available programming.

Eventually (about 1992), HBO completely left the VideoCipher II datastream in favor of the more secure VideoCipher II Plus (RS) datastream; other programmers followed suit. Having a VideoCipher II module was no longer worth anything unless the viewer wanted to watch adult programming without audio.

At the time, most local cable providers did not pass the encrypted audio to subscribers. As such, some viewers who had both cable and satellite found a way to marry audio and video. Viewers found a way to get audio from a cable line and video from satellite with their VideoCipher II and push both to their VCRs and TVs.  Due to the advanced VideoCipher II Plus datastream, video could appear to "flicker" or struggle on an old VideoCipher II module (modules with a newer "pirate chip" installed, tended to be less prone to this issue).

=== Videocipher II+/RS ===
In 1992, following years of security breaches with the Videocipher II system, General Instruments introduced the Videocipher II Plus descrambler module. In 1993, some VCII programming was phased out, especially premium movie channels and pay per view.  For a time, many networks and Sports CH (now Fox sports) remained on the VC II stream. The Videocipher II+ was a higher-security system with two variants. The Videocipher-RS system (RS for Renewable Security) is the Videocipher II Plus system with a slot in the back of the descrambler module to where a card could be inserted to upgrade the security if the VCII Plus system were ever breached.

== Technological obsolescence ==
General Instrument discontinued production of VC II+ RS modules in 1998 in favor of its [[DigiCipher]] system. Over the next ten years, broadcasters migrated to digital transmission delivery and discontinued their analog feeds. In October 2008, Motorola (who acquired General Instruments in January 2000) announced that their authorization center would no longer authorize any new decoders after December 31, 2008, and that the current remaining analog Videocipher channels would switch entirely to digital transmission after that same date. [[The Weather Channel]], the last major television network to utilize the VideoCipher II system, discontinued its analog signal on AMC 11 transponder 13 on June 26, 2014, effectively ending the Videocipher era.

== Legacy ==
Within the years of the change of signal scrambling from VC II to VCII+, [[DirecTV]] began to take on many former [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] VideoCipher subscribers and illegal receivers of programming.  Many who were involved with providing illegal VideoCipher II programming moved over to hacking and providing users illegal access to the (at the time) new [[RCA]] based [[MPEG-2]] digital satellite subscription service.

'''World Victory Road''' ('''WVR''') is a defunct [[Japan]]ese [[Mixed Martial Arts]] (MMA) organization which promoted the '''Sengoku Raiden Championship''' ('''SRC''') in [[Japan]]. The organization was formed in 2007 following the purchase of [[PRIDE FC]] by [[Zuffa]]. It operated in conjunction with the Japan Mixed Martial Arts Federation (JMM). The Sengoku championship was broadcast on [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] and pay-per-view in Japan, and on [[HDNet]] in United States.

Beginning with the December 31 show, Sengoku was known as Sengoku Raiden Championship. "Raiden" means "thunder and lightning" and refers to a legendary 18th century sumo. WVR exec Kokuho said they hoped the initials "SRC" will be more palatable to international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2009/9/23/1051907/snapshot-of-the-day-sengoku-raiden|title=Snapshot of the Day: Sengoku Raiden Championship|last=Nelson|first=Chris|date=Sep 23, 2009|work=BloodyElbow.com|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2011, it was reported that [[Don Quijote (store)|Don Quijote]], a Japanese discount store chain serving as the primary sponsor of the promotion, had ceased all funding to WVR. That same day, WVR officials issued a press release stating that barring the sudden emergence of a new primary sponsor, the promotion was effectively finished.

==Broadcast==
The promotion received a boost in visibility in their endeavor to compete with [[DREAM (mixed martial arts)|DREAM]] when it reached a broadcast agreement for [[Fuji TV]] to televise matches in Japan. It was significant given the fact that this is the first MMA promotion to be televised on the network since it dropped [[PRIDE FC]] from its lineup in mid-2006. The events will be shown live on Fuji TV 739 and then a two-hour version later in the night on Fuji TV.&lt;ref name=fuji&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaontap.com/mma/entry/world-victory-road-on-fuji-tv/|title=World Victory Road on Fuji TV?. MMA on Tap. March 21, 2008|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2009, [[HDNet]] announced they had reached and agreement with WVR to broadcast its Sengoku-events in America starting March 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=8140&amp;zoneid=13|title=HDNET REACHES DEAL TO AIR SENGOKU EVENTS|last=Mendoza|first=Ricardo|date=February 6, 2009|work=MMAWeekly.com|accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
WVR's rules differ somewhat from the [[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]].  Among the differences are the allowance of knees and stomps to the head of downed opponent while elbows to the head and soccer kicks are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=4959&amp;zoneid=13 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230214802/http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=4959&amp;zoneid=13 |date=December 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the Unified Rules, fights have three rounds each lasting five minutes.
