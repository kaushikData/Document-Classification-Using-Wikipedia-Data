{{Years in film}}

The decade of the '''1910s in film''' involved some significant films.

==Events==
The 1910s saw the origins of [[Hollywood]] as the centre of the American film industry relocated from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[California]]. By 1912, major motion-picture companies had set up production near or in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Lewis. ''The Rise of the American Film'' Harcourt Brace, New York, 1930; p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1900s, most motion picture patents were held by Thomas Edison's [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] in New Jersey, and filmmakers were often sued to stop their productions. To escape this, filmmakers began moving out west, where Edison's patents could not be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Hollywood, California|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3871.html|accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the weather was ideal and there was quick access to various settings. Los Angeles became the capital of the film industry.&lt;ref name="Mintz, S. 2013"&gt;Mintz, S., and S. McNeil. "Hollywood as History." Digital History. N.p., 2013. Web. 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hollywood-Studios-1922.jpg|right|thumb|Hollywood movie studios, 1922]]

During the [[First World War]] the film industries of Europe were devastated, and Hollywood replaced the French and Italian firms as the most popular film makers in the world.

The forum stimulated discourse between local communities and nationally known artists through hands-on video workshops, interviews, lectures, performances, informal discussions and [[road trips]].&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Journal Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=Marcus|title='Art and the Media: An art project adopts techniques of the mass media'|journal=Albuquerque Journal Magazine, Impact|date=January 28, 1986|volume= 9| issue = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was sponsored by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], Albuquerque Arts Alliance, the Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Art, and the New Mexico Arts Division.&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Living Magazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Patrick|author2=Widmer, Gwenn|title='Front Pages, Frontier Living: Disappearing Space (Even in the West)'|journal=Albuquerque Living Magazine|date=January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ART/MEDIA operated as a ''museum without walls'' with an office located in the historical [[Kimo Theater]] on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]].&lt;ref name="Albuquerque Living Magazine"/&gt; Inspired by the concept/model of [[Joseph Beuys]] [[social sculpture]], that have the potential to transform society, ART/MEDIA was an extended artwork that included human interactions, creating structures and systems within society using language, thought, objects, events and actions.&lt;ref name="The Santa Fe Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|title='Beyond the Andrews (on Paul Bob)'|newspaper=The Santa Fe Reporter|date=February 12, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was documented by seminal video artists [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] who founded [[The Kitchen]] in [[New York City]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="City Arts"&gt;{{cite journal|title='ART/MEDIA Funded by National Endowment for the Arts and New Mexico Arts Division'|journal=City Arts|date=November–December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The concept for the project originated in 1984 with artists Duane Griffin, Patrick Clancy and Scott Portman who later joined with Co-Directors [[Eve Andree Laramee]] and Ann Zimmerman to found the project and organization. The [[Santa Fe Center for Contemporary Arts]] was the fiscal sponsor under 501c3 not-for-profit status. Bob Gaylor, then director of SFCCC and invited Griffin and Laramee to be part of a [[Think Tank]] at [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] where they met with [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[Allan Kaprow]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Edward "Ned" Hall]], [[Jerome Rothenberg]], and other artists and thinkers. Empowered by this experience, a team of advisors were assembled. Gaylor served as a primary advisor throughout the project, along with Gordon Church of the City of Albuquerque Cultural Affairs Office. The Albuquerque Arts Alliance and the City of [[Albuquerque]] became the second fiscal sponsor, providing an office in the historical [[Kimo Theater]] on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]]. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] introduced the organizers to [[Godfrey Reggio]], director of the film [[Koyannisqatsi]] (1982) who provided guidance on organizing [[Social Sculpture]] events as ''[[public service announcements]]''.  Reggio, having been involved in numerous progressive political causes, took interest because his Institute for Regional Education had developed a multi-media campaign of PSA's for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] on the invasion of privacy and use of technology to control behavior in 1972. Grants were received from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] in the InterArts and the Artist Forums categories and the New Mexico Arts Division.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''Académie Suisse''' was an art school founded by Charles Suisse, and was located at the corner of the Quai des Orfévres and the Boulevard du Palais, in Paris. From [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] to [[Cézanne]], most major French artists frequented this place to meet colleagues or to study after the models supplied.

==Charles Suisse==
According to Monneret, Charles Suisse was a former model of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;Probably not to be mixed up with the architect [[Charles Suisse]] (1846-1906), formed at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and since 1897 head of the ''[http://www.mediatheque-patrimoine.culture.gouv.fr/fr/biographies/suisse_charles.html Monuments historiques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204054639/http://www.mediatheque-patrimoine.culture.gouv.fr/fr/biographies/suisse_charles.html |date=December 4, 2008 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Polish Artists and Designers''' ({{lang|pl|Związek Polskich Artystów Plastyków}}, ZPAP) is an official association of professional artists in [[Poland]], representing more than 8,500 learned artists working in the field of [[visual arts]], including: painting, sculpture, graphic design, interior and set design, ceramics, fabric arts, as well as new media, and [[art restoration]].

The Association was founded in 1911 in [[Kraków]] during the [[Partitions of Poland]]. In [[Polish culture in the Interbellum|the interwar period]] until 1939 it served as a trade union and in 1945, following World War II, it was formally re-established as an association.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Sujo, [https://books.google.com/books?id=y7WuzDK3dSkC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=ZPAP  ''Legacies of Silence''.] Published by New Age Publishers, 2001; 127 pages. {{ISBN|0-85667-534-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artluk.com/onas.php  ''artluk'' Magazine] with funds by [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of the Republic of Poland|Polish Ministry of Culture and Art]]. {{en icon}} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, ZPAP supported the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] and opposed the imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]]. Consequently, the military authorities disbanded the Association when it refused to retract its [[communiqué]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Umbrella Magazine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FGlUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=1982+%22The+suspension+of+ZPAP,+reported+by+the+official+press,+was+ordered+after+it+refused+to+retract+eight+communiques+released+in+the+last+year%22&amp;dq=1982+%22The+suspension+of+ZPAP,+reported+by+the+official+press,+was+ordered+after+it+refused+to+retract+eight+communiques+released+in+the+last+year%22&amp;pgis=1  Item notes: v. 5-7, page 68.] Published by Umbrella Associates, U.S., 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Inglot, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RnAaq6ws_kMC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%22the+majority+of+artists+joined+in+the+widespread+national+effort+to+break+the+party-state+monopoly%22#PPA95,M1  ''The Figurative Sculpture of Magdalena Abakanowicz''], page 95. Published by University of California Press, 2004; 154 pages. {{nobreak|{{ISBN|0-520-23125-2}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ZPAP operated unofficially until the [[History of Poland (1989–present)|restoration of democracy]] in 1989. Today, ZPAP features prominently across the country with 23 regional Chapters, paid staff, curators, publications, and regional art galleries promoting work of its members.&lt;ref name="IAM"&gt;Instytut Adama Mickiewicza, [http://www.culture.pl/pl/culture/artykuly/in_or_zpap  "Sztuki wizualne: Związek Polskich Artystów Plastyków"] at www.culture.pl ISSN 1734-0624 Nr 2628&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
ZPAP membership is limited to graduates of art faculties of relevant institutions of higher learning, with the main emphasis on regional Academies of Fine Arts. On top of its creative presence in major Polish cities, the Association operates two professional development retreats, in [[Ustka]] and in [[Świnoujście]].&lt;ref name="IAM" /&gt; It sponsors dozens of commercial art galleries across Poland as well as selected stores with professional art supplies. ZPAP organizes a number of annual events, and offers its own [[Jan Cybis]] Award for creative achievement. In 1996 the Association organized the UNESCO conference around the international status of an artist.&lt;ref name="IAM" /&gt; It is the leading advocacy group working in conjunction with the Polish governmental agencies regulating labor laws applicable to practising art professionals. ZPAP is represented in the World Executive Committee of the [[International Association of Art]] (IAA).&lt;ref name="zpap.org"&gt;[http://www.zpap.org.pl/index.php?IdKat=1003010018&amp;IdKat2=1157655602  Official webpage of The Association of Polish Artists and Designers] {{en icon}} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1996, ZPAP manages copyrights of about 1,000 members and is in charge of issuing  licenses for the commercial use of their artwork. The economic nonprofit activity of the Association is geared toward generating funds necessary for the maintaining of its venues, as well as providing financial support for members in need.&lt;ref name="zpap.org"/&gt;

The main office of ZPAP is in [[Warsaw]] and is located at the upper floor of the historic [[Kamienica (architecture)|kamienica]] Efrosa at [[Nowy Świat Street|ul. Nowy Świat]] 7 ''(pictured)'', where Princes of the [[Lubomirski family]] once lived in the 18th century. The building was rebuilt with its original [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] portal intact following wartime destruction of the Polish capital.&lt;ref name="zpap.org"/&gt;

Regional chapters of ZPAP are located in the following cities: [[Białystok]], [[Bielsko-Biała]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Częstochowa]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Katowice]], [[Kielce]], [[Koszalin]], [[Kraków]], [[Lublin]], [[Łódź]], [[Olsztyn]], [[Opole]], [[Poznań]], [[Radom]], [[Rzeszów]], [[Szczecin]], [[Toruń]], [[Warszawa]], [[Wrocław]], [[Zakopane]], [[Zielona Góra]], and [[Gliwice]].

'''The Bloor Street Culture Corridor'''  is a cluster of arts and cultural organizations in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. It is located on [[Bloor Street|Bloor St. W]], between [[Bathurst Street (Toronto)|Bathurst]] and [[Bay Street|Bay]] Streets.

The Bloor Street Culture Corridor has a wide variety of art genres, from museum experiences to films, art exhibitions to music concerts. The area also is culturally diverse, including Aboriginal, French, Jewish, Italian, Japanese, Estonian, African and Caribbean arts and culture.

Officially launched in April 2014,&lt;ref name="star-ann"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2014/03/27/twelve_bloor_st_arts_institutions_form_new_culture_corridor.html|title=Twelve Bloor St. arts institutions form new 'Culture Corridor'|author=Eastwood, Joel|date=27 March 2014|publisher=Toronto Star|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the collective shares a website, [[social media]] and a [[mobile app]] to promote exhibitions at its member institutions. In 2016, the Corridor was successful in working with the [[City of Toronto]] to have the section of Bloor St. West designated an official City of Toronto cultural corridor. Each year more than three million persons visit the Corridor's arts and culture destinations, and attend exhibitions, performances, and events. Together, the Bloor St. Culture Corridor organizations employ more than 5,500 culture workers and generate more than $629,500,000 in economic impact each year.

'''''Bound''''' is a 1996 American [[neo-noir]] [[Crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] written and directed by [[the Wachowskis]] in their [[List of directorial debuts|feature film directorial debut]]. Violet ([[Jennifer Tilly]]), who longs to escape her relationship with her [[American Mafia|mafioso]] boyfriend Caesar ([[Joe Pantoliano]]), enters into a clandestine affair with alluring ex-con Corky ([[Gina Gershon]]), and the two women hatch a scheme to steal $2 million of mafia money.

''Bound'' was the first film directed by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from [[Billy Wilder]] to tell a noir story filled with sex and violence. Financed by [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the film was made on a tight budget with the help of frugal crew members including cinematographer [[Bill Pope]]. The directors initially struggled to cast the lesbian characters of Violet and Corky before securing Tilly and Gershon. To choreograph the sex scenes, the directors employed "sex educator" [[Susie Bright]], who also made a [[cameo appearance]] in the film.

''Bound'' received positive reviews from film critics who praised the humor and style of the directors as well as the realistic portrayal of a lesbian relationship in a mainstream film. Detractors of the film found its plot superficial and criticized the violence as excessive. The film won several festival awards.

==Plot==

Corky ([[Gina Gershon]]), a lesbian ex-con who has just finished a five-year jail sentence, arrives at an apartment building to start work as a painter and plumber. On her way up to the apartment, she encounters the couple who live next-door, Violet ([[Jennifer Tilly]]) and Caesar ([[Joe Pantoliano]]). After Caesar has gone out, Violet flirts with Corky and asks her to help retrieve an earring that has fallen down her sink. After Corky extracts the earring, Violet admits she lost it on purpose in order to get closer to Corky, and starts to seduce her. They are interrupted by the arrival of Caesar and Corky goes back to work. When she leaves for the day, Violet follows her to her truck. They go to Corky's apartment and have sex. The next morning, Violet tells Corky that Caesar is a money launderer for the Mafia and they have been together for five years.

Later, Violet overhears Caesar and his Mafia associates beating and torturing Shelly ([[Barry Kivel]]), a man who has been skimming money from the business. Upset by the violence and cruelty, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she wants to make a new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. Corky, already wary of Violet's intentions, is unsure whether to trust her.

Shelly is shot and killed by Johnnie ([[Christopher Meloni]]), the son of Mafia boss Gino Marzzone ([[Richard C. Sarafian]]), and Caesar returns to the apartment with a bag of bloody money. Angry at Johnnie for killing Shelly in a fit of rage and splattering blood everywhere, Caesar proceeds to wash, iron and hang the money to dry.

Violet explains to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie will be coming to pick up the money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.

Everything goes as planned until Caesar finds the money gone. He realizes that if he runs, Gino will think he took the money. He decides he has to get the money back from Johnnie. Panicking, Violet threatens to leave. Caesar pulls out his gun and forces her to stay, thinking that maybe she and Johnnie have stolen the money and framed him.

Corky waits next-door with the money while Gino and Johnnie arrive. After watching Johnnie flirt with Violet and taunt him, Caesar pulls out a gun and tells Gino that his son stole the money. In an angry panic, he kills both Gino and Johnnie, and Gino's bodyguard Roy. He tells Violet that they have to find the money, dispose of the bodies, and pretend Gino and Johnnie never arrived, lest their Mafia pals find the money or men missing. Unable to find the money at Johnnie's apartment, Caesar telephones Mickey ([[John P. Ryan (actor)|John P. Ryan]]), a Mafia friend, telling him that Gino has yet to arrive.

After discovering Corky and Violet stole the money, Caesar ties them up, gags them, threatens to torture them, and demands to know where it is. When Mickey arrives to see what is going on, Caesar, panicked, makes a deal with Violet to help him stall. As he prepares to kill Mickey, Violet calls the landline from Johnnie's cell phone and quickly convinces Caesar to pretend that he's on the phone with Gino, who's calling from a hospital to explain that he and Johnnie were in a car accident. Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money, and he goes next-door to find it. Violet escapes and makes a phone call to Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. In the meantime, Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her to the ground. Just as he is about to kill her, Violet arrives and pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can. Caesar tells Violet that he knows she will not shoot him, to which she replies, "Caesar, you don't know shit", before killing him.

Later, Mickey, who believes Violet's story, tells her that he will find Caesar, and that there is no need to involve the police. Mickey wants Violet to be his girlfriend, but she tells him that she needs a clean break—which she makes by driving off hand-in-hand with Corky.

==Background and production==
===Conception===
Film producer [[Joel Silver]] has said that after working as scriptwriters on ''[[Assassins (film)|Assassins]]'', the Wachowskis made ''Bound'' as an "audition piece" to prove that they knew what to do on a movie set.&lt;ref name="Marx" /&gt; Conversely, Lana Wachowski has said Joel "made that up."  The Wachowskis themselves claim they "decided simply to focus on making their own directorial debut."&lt;ref name="Vary"&gt;{{cite web | last =Vary | first=Adam | title = The Wachowskis Refuse To Take No For An Answer | work =BuzzFeed | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/the-wachowskis-jupiter-ascending-the-matrix-cloud-atlas | date = February 6, 2015 | accessdate =August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had the idea to write a story about how one might see a woman on the street and make assumptions about her sexuality, but how those assumptions might be wrong.&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{cite web|last=Horowitz |first=Josh |title=The Lost Wachowski Brothers Interview |work=MoviePoopShoot.com |url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/interviews/27.html |date=November 5, 2003 |accessdate=March 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031202184946/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/interviews/27.html |archivedate=December 2, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to play with stereotypes and make an entertaining film that contained sex and violence, because those are the kinds of films that they like to watch.&lt;ref name="Marx" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horowitz" /&gt; Seeing [[film noir]] as a genre within which they could tell a contained story and twist conventions, they described [[Billy Wilder]] as a big influence.&lt;ref name="Horowitz" /&gt;

When executives at some studios read the script, they told the Wachowskis that if they changed the character of Corky to that of a man, they would be interested. The siblings declined, saying "that movie's been made a million times, so we're really not interested in it."&lt;ref name="gadfly"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whilk |first=Nat |last2=Whitehead |first2=Jayson |title=Glory Bound: An interview with Larry and Andy Wachowski |work=[[Gadfly Online]] |publisher=Gadfly Productions |date=January 1998 |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive-wachowski.html |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040301035225/http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive-wachowski.html |archivedate=March 1, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dino De Laurentiis]], the executive producer on ''Assassins'', offered to finance ''Bound'' and his company produced it, giving them "free rein" with regard to the story.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Wachowskis]], [[Joe Pantoliano]], [[Jennifer Tilly]], [[Gina Gershon]], [[Susie Bright]] |title=Director/Writers/actors Commentary |type = [[DVD]] |publisher=[[Gramercy Pictures]] |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's budget was $6 million.&lt;ref name="Marx" /&gt;

===Casting===
The Wachowskis struggled to cast the roles of Violet and Corky, seemingly because of the lesbian content of the film. Few actresses were interested.&lt;ref name="gadfly" /&gt; The part of Violet was expected to go to [[Linda Hamilton]], and Jennifer Tilly read for the part of Corky. She loved the role and was looking forward to playing a character very different from previous parts in her career.&lt;ref name="VP"&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Vincent | first =Mal | title = Tilly is no Shrinking Violet in "Bound" | work =[[The Virginian-Pilot]] | publisher =[[Landmark Media Enterprises]] | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080506144714/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1996/vp961107/11070036.htm | archivedate =May 6, 2008 | date =July 11, 1996 | url =http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1996/vp961107/11070036.htm | accessdate =March 8, 2010 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the part of Violet became available, and Gina Gershon came in to read for Corky, Tilly agreed that Gershon would make a better Corky.&lt;ref name="now on"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harkness |first=John |title=Jennifer Tilly&amp;nbsp;— Noir thriller brings versatile actor out of ingenue ghetto |work=[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]] |publisher=NOW Communications Inc |date=October 1996 |url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/16/05/Ent/cover.html |accessdate=November 7, 2007 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224440/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/16/05/Ent/cover.html |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She realized that she identified with the character of Violet, a woman "underestimated by all the men around her" who has to "play the game".&lt;ref name="VP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diva"&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Stagg Elliott | first =Victoria | title = Bound to Please | work =[[Diva (magazine)|Diva]] | publisher =Millivres Prowler Group Ltd | date =March 1997 | url =http://www.bound.ch/diva.htm | accessdate =June 19, 2007 | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; She describes it as the best role she had ever had.&lt;ref name="VP" /&gt; Gina Gershon suggested Joe Pantoliano to the Wachowskis for the part of Caesar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW WITH JOE PANTOLIANO (PART 2 OF 2)|date=4 April 2001|publisher=[[IGN]]|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/04/interview-with-joe-pantoliano-part-2-of-2|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first lead role in a film, he describes it as his favorite.&lt;ref name="wombat"&gt;{{cite web | last =Morris | first =Clint | authorlink =Clint Morris | title = Joe Pantoliano: Exclusive Interview | work =WebWombat.com | publisher =WebWombat Pty Ltd | url =http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/badboys_int.htm | accessdate =June 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
''Bound'' was shot in thirty-eight days in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], California.&lt;ref name="gadfly" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; The Wachowskis' original [[Cinematographer|director of photography]] resigned on the grounds that he could not do the film with the limited budget he had available, nor did he know anyone he believed could. Subsequently, cinematographer [[Bill Pope]] was hired, who knew "a bunch of cheap guys".&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamm |first=Spencer |title=Bill Pope |work=The Matrix official site |url=http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/pope_int.html |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108121657/http://whatisthematrix.warnerbros.com/cmp/pope_int.html |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller's]] neo-noir ''[[Sin City]]'' series in particular.&lt;ref name="Marx" /&gt; Pope's sound counterpart was sound director [[Dane Davis]]. One of his ideas was to give Corky a [[cat]]-like quality by making a "swishing" sound every time she walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;

The Wachowskis asked Joe Pantoliano to watch [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' and to focus on [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character in order to prepare the paranoia of Caesar.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; Gershon's influences for her role were [[James Dean]], [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Clint Eastwood]].&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; Both Gershon and Tilly were nervous about filming the sex scenes and prepared by drinking [[tequila]].&lt;ref name="diva" /&gt;

Very little improvisation took place during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar near the end of the film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required [[surgical suture|stitches]].&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;

===Sex scenes===
The sex scenes were choreographed by feminist writer and sex educator [[Susie Bright]]. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright and sent her a copy of the script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly what was happening in the sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;

Bright appeared as Jesse, the woman Corky tries to talk to in the bar. Comedian [[Margaret Smith (comedian)|Margaret Smith]] played Jesse's girlfriend and the extras in the bar scene were Bright's friends—"real life San Francisco [[Dyke (slang)|dykes]]".&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;

==Themes==
The Wachowskis describe several themes present in ''Bound''. They say that the film is about "the boxes people make of their lives", that it is not only gay people who "live in [[Closeted|closets]]". They wanted to define all of ''Bound'''s characters by the "sort of trap that they were making out of their lives".&lt;ref name="gadfly" /&gt; Violet is trapped in her life with Caesar, and in the first scene, Corky is literally inside Violet's closet, bound and gagged by Caesar.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; This scene is echoed later in the film when Violet says "I had this image of you inside of me..."&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; This theme of being trapped is exacerbated by the claustrophobic feeling created by the fact that most of the film takes place in Corky's apartment, Violet and Casear's apartment, or the apartment next door where Corky is working.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;

Susie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film. One is the concept of the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; Bright describes it as a movie that is "wet" (feminine) as opposed to "hard" (masculine).&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of "lesbian signs". She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and "girly"—making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that "everyone in the film wants to be with Violet".&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the [[LGBT]] film festival screenings.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt;

==Release==
===Rating===
''Bound'' was rated by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) as R for "strong sexuality, violence and language." To achieve that rating, the directors had to cut part of the first sex scene between Corky and Violet.&lt;ref name="DVD" /&gt; The MPAA were most concerned with the images of what Lana Wachowski called "hand-sex".&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{cite book | last =Merck | first =Mandy | title =In Your Face: 9 Sexual Studies | publisher =NYU Press | year =2000 | pages =124–147 | isbn =0-8147-5639-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rated R in Australia, R18 in New Zealand and 18 in the United Kingdom. In Canada it was rated as R in [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]], 18 in [[Nova Scotia]] and 16+ in [[Quebec]].

Janet Maslin for ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the grisly violence in ''Bound'' would likely limit its audience and Ebert said that its shocking violence would offend some audiences.&lt;ref name="CST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Some critics said that the violent behavior of the characters had no moral justification. Rita Kempley for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it "well-nigh unwatchable cruelty for its own sake".&lt;ref name="RK" /&gt; McCarthy, who called the central relationship between the two women unbelievable and unsympathetic, said "just because Violet and Corky fall for each other doesn't mean they somehow fall into a privileged state of grace in which vile behavior can be forgiven."&lt;ref name="TM" /&gt; Other critics were less concerned, calling the violence "comically excessive" and "Tarantino-like".&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;

[[File:BreyersVintage.jpg|thumb|Two vintage "Traditional" sized Breyer horses and a smaller "Stablemates" model]]

'''Breyer Animal Creations''' (commonly referred to as Breyer), a division of Reeves International, Inc,&lt;ref&gt;Verdon, Joan (December 11, 2003), [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-111191420.html "New Jersey Maker of World's Favorite Model Horses Continues to Go Strong."] ''Knight Ridder/Tribune''. Accessed November 2012. {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a manufacturer of  [[model horse|model animals]]. The company specializes in model horses made from [[cellulose acetate]], a form of plastic, and produces other animal models from the same material as well. Less well known are its porcelain and resin horse figures, which are aimed at the adult collector market. The company also produces model [[Horse tack|tack]] accessories, such as [[stables]], [[barn]]s, and [[Horse grooming|grooming]] implements in scale to its model horses.

==History==
Breyer Animal Creations was founded in 1950 in Chicago, Illinois, as Breyer Molding Company. It gained recognition when commissioned by [[F.W. Woolworth]] to create a horse statue (now known as the # 57 Western Horse) to adorn a mantel clock. It was approximately 1:9 scale and the model was retained as payment for molding the parts. Orders began to roll in for the horse only and the Breyer Animal Creations company was founded.  Since then, Breyer has become a leader in producing model horses.

In 1984, Reeves International acquired Breyer Animal Creations and spent the next 20 years completing its transformation from toy distribution to manufacturing.  Today, Breyer remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Reeves International.  Model horses are sold through independent distributors and the Breyer website.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Nancy Atkinson, "Breyer Molds and Models, Fifth Edition". Schiffer Publishing, 1997, p. 332,&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=January 2017}}&lt;!-- How can a book published in 1997 be a source for this? --&gt;

While Breyer products were originally manufactured in the United States, production now takes place in China.

==Scales==
There are several scales of Breyer horse models:

*Traditional: 1:9 scale (adult models are approximately 11″ long × 9″ high) and is the most popular scale.
*Classic: 1:12 scale (adult models are approximately 9″ long × 6″ high)
*Ponies/Pony Gals: 1:12 scale (adult models are approximately 9″ long × 6″ high) and are aimed at the youth market.
*Paddock Pal/Little Bits: 1:24 scale (about 6″ long x 5″ high) - Now retired, but some products are found in craft kits.
*Stablemates: 1:32 scale (adults are about 4″ long × 3″ high)
*Mini Whinnies: 1:64 scale (adults are about 2″ long x 1″ high)

As of 2008, the Ponies line has been replaced with a similar line titled "Pony Gals".  The line differs from other Breyer products in that the models have brushable manes and tails and may have jointed heads, necks, and legs, and are marketed towards younger children.

==Production processes==
Each horse is [[Casting|cast]] in a two to three piece mold.  Both halves are then put together and the seams are sanded and polished.  Markings and color patterns are usually obtained by using a [[stencil]] known as a mask, although most older models were [[airbrushed]] by hand, with markings such as undefined socks or a bald face merely left unpainted.  Most detailing, such as eye-whites (common on 1950s and 1960s models and is now enjoying a resurgence in modern models), brands, or other individual markings are painstakingly hand-painted.  Sometimes, a variation in the paint job occurs.  A variation is a difference, usually in the paint job, of one or a minority of a model as they came from the factory.  The reason for variations is rarely known.  For example, there is a common mold typically called the Proud Arabian Stallion (abbreviated PAS by collectors).  For many years it was produced by Breyer with a dappled gray coat and a gray mane, tail and hooves.  However, for some unknown reason a few of these models came from the factory with black manes, tails, and hooves, and black socks or stockings.  These special, rare models are considered variations of the Dapple Grey PAS model and are very valuable compared to the regular model, which is quite common. They were later determined to be their own unique colorway, and not a variation.

Breyer uses a number of different molds, with most molds having been released in several colors.  For instance, there is a commonly used mold referred to as the Family Arabian Stallion (so popular that it is known as "FAS" to collectors). Breyer has released runs of this mold in a multitude of different coat colors with various markings and details such as socks and blazes, appaloosa blankets, even Native American paint decorations since its original production in 1956.  Models may also have different finishes, such as matte or glossy.  Each version of a particular mold is considered a separate model, and is almost always given a number and name. In certain instances, however, some models do not receive a number—these may be known as "test runs".  New molds are often introduced, and old ones are sometimes "retired"—not created anymore—or even accidentally broken or lost.

The coloring and marking variations are infinite, of course, and include all the variations found among actual horses.  Breyer also releases models in more unrealistic colors - "decorator models". The original four decorator colors were produced in the 1960s: Wedgwood (light blue with white mane and tail, intended to suggest the colors of Wedgwood china), Copenhagen (dappled blue with white mane and tail), Florentine (dappled gold with white mane and tail), and Gold Charm (solid gold body with white mane and tail). A woodgrain finish was also produced. Later Breyer introduced a "bronze" finish and more recently "silver filigree" which is basically silver Florentine. The original four decorator colors are still occasionally used in limited run editions but the original decorators are now highly sought after by collectors. Several more recent decorator models have scenes and images painted on them, especially those done in the Halloween line, and a few have been cast in a translucent form of cellulose acetate to look like blown glass, known as "clearware". The company recently introduced a metallic "two-color" paint with a very flashy effect. Models painted with this paint are typically limited edition.

==Collector value of products==
A particular model horse can be graded, or valued, in several ways, depending on the purpose of the grading scale.

Unlike some collectible toys, Breyer horse packaging does not generally affect the model's value.  Unfortunately, there have been some issues with pre-2000s packaging, in which if a model is left in the box for an extended period of time, the box can actually cause harm to the horse's finish due to rubbing of the horse's paint on the sides of the box or on the plastic ties binding it to the packaging, therefore diminishing the model's value.

Common flaws in used models are scratches, rubs, breaks (ears, tails, legs), seam splits, warped legs, yellowing, and so on, which come from use or careless storage.  Other flaws come from the factory, such as very slightly off-target painting or slightly sloppy detailing, badly sanded seams, over spray, or bent legs (from improper cooling).  Some flaws from the factory are considered variations and are sought after by collectors as rare oddities.

The rarity of the model is the other primary method of judging collectibility and value.  A model can be defined as rare if it was released for a short time period a long while back, so there are not many left in circulation, or if it was released in very limited numbers.  The most extreme cases of this are the very few Breyer releases that are one-of-a-kind ([[OOAK]]), which are always given out as prizes or sold off at auction for charity at the yearly Breyerfest gatherings.  These horses are by far the most coveted and highly valued model horses.

==Model horse shows==
Model horse shows are a way for collectors to show off their models.  In a show, a model is described as being one of two grades:  Live Show Quality (LSQ) or Photo Show Quality (PSQ). LSQ means that the horse and all tack accurately depict the real animal and must be in good enough condition (considering flaws from the factory, as well as from use) to be inspected on all sides. PSQ is less demanding, since both horse and tack can be seen from only one side in the photo and close examination is not possible.  Therefore, the standards of condition and realistic appearance are not quite as high.

There are two types of shows: live shows and photo shows. In a live show, the model is judged from all sides. In a photo show, images of a model are sent/emailed in, and therefore can only be judged be judged from one side. In a live show, there are three types of classes: collectability, halter, and performance. In a collectability class, an entrant's goal is to have the rarest model. In a halter class, the model must have a name and a breed, and this class is judged after how the model matches the breed it is given. The goal in performance class is to create a realistic and accurate depiction of an equine sport.

==Customizing==
Another branch of the model horse hobby is customizing, in which a single model is remade in some way, making it unique.  Sometimes models are simply repainted or have patterns etched in their existing paint (appaloosa or paint horse markings, for instance), while other models are repositioned by being heated and then shaped.  In the most drastic cases, the artist will completely re-sculpt the model, cutting body parts away, repositioning and reattaching them, and re-painting and finishing them.  Breyer models are popular candidates for customizing, due to their inexpensiveness and ability to be easily obtained.

Depending on how well the customizing was done, how well-known the artist is, and how attractive the results are, these special, one-of-a-kind models can sometimes sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars.

==BreyerFest==
BreyerFest was first held in 1990 and since then has been held annually in July at the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in Lexington, Kentucky. This popular event is a three-day festival for model horse collectors of all ages.  During this event, attendees can purchase special run Breyer models sold only at Breyerfest, purchase RR (Regular Run) and retired models from Breyer and dealers in attendance, and participate in large [[model horse showing|model horse shows]]. In addition, there are classes on how to paint, customize, and repair models as well as lectures on collecting and judging them.  Special guests of honor, usually renowned trainers and famous horses, are also present and perform for the attendees. Typically, the equine guest of honor has been previously represented by a Breyer model horse. A live auction is held each year featuring one-of-a-kind model horses created by Breyer and sold to the highest bidder, often for thousands of dollars. A silent auction for rare or customized models and model horse related accessories is also held. Included in the purchase price of a 3-day ticket is a Traditional-scale "Celebration" model, and 1-day ticket holders receive a Stablemate-scale model. Each BreyerFest has a unique theme, upon which many or all of the special-run models are designed.

==Availability==
Breyer models are available through the company website and from a variety of online and brick and mortar dealers such as toy and tack shops. In the secondary market models are frequently found on [[eBay]], and [http://www.modelhorsesalespages.com/ Model Horse Sales Pages]. Breyer also has a dealer finder on its website.

==Publications==
''Just About Horses'' (JAH) is Breyer's model horse magazine. Issued annually to Collector Club members, this is the most popular model horse magazine in America. Subscriber benefits include sneak peeks into Breyer releases and events, articles on the hobby, and highlights on noted collectors and sculptors. Information on back issues of ''Just About Horses'' can be found on the "Identify Your Breyer" website.

''Breyer Molds and Models: Horses, Riders, and Animals'', fifth edition, by Nancy Young is an encyclopedic book on models made by Breyer from 1990 to 1997. It includes information on production runs and colors, mold marks and variations, Breyer catalogs, tack, stickers, lamps, clocks, and much more. Though no new editions have been released, this book is the most informative one available on the history and minutiae of Breyer models.

The ''Breyer Animal Collector's Guide'' by Felicia Browell (and others, in the later editions) is essentially a price guide featuring photographs of most of the models released by Breyer as well as values for them based on average selling prices.

The '''Bubalus Period,''' also known as the '''Large Wild Fauna''' period, is the earliest known period of [[Saharan rock art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzx46VrEHE4C&amp;pg=PA286&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;dq=Bubalus+Period&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6GPWrP1MJk&amp;sig=PM4UZCnk-0NdkZoJnDP17cigYas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HqMCS-vrDcflnAe5hPl2&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bubalus%20Period&amp;f=false Methodology and African prehistory By Jacqueline Ki-Zerbo, Joseph Ki-Zerbo]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the engravings from this period have been dated between 10,000 BCE and 7,000 BCE.&lt;ref name="monica" /&gt; There are no images of pottery, cattle, or crops, which means that these carvings were mostly likely produced by a hunter-gatherer culture and not by a [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]] culture, although the two may have existed simultaneously during a brief period of time. The majority of the rock engravings in the Large Wild Fauna style are located in what is known as the [[Maghreb]] region of the Sahara, encompassing a wide area spanning across Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia – specifically, the [[Fezzan]] region of southwestern Libya.&lt;ref name="monica"&gt;{{cite book|last=Visonà|first=Monica Blackmun|title=A History of Art in Africa - Second Edition|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, 07458|isbn=0-13-612872-6|pages=22–24|url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/History-of-Art-in-Africa-A/9780136128724.page}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a period of time when the desert was well-watered and fertile, this region was populated by nomadic groups known today as the [[Berber people|Berbers]] (from the Greek "barbarian," a term they used for all foreigners). Nomadic groups such as these had trade routes across the Saharan region, many of which are older than the desert itself. It is believed that the Berbers were responsible for much of the rock engravings in the area.&lt;ref name="monica" /&gt;

The names of this particular style of rock art – "Large Wild Fauna" and "Bubalus" – refer to the subject matter depicted in the majority of the engravings. Most Bubalus art consists of animals that would have been plentiful in the region when it was fertile: giraffes, elephants, and a now-extinct species of bovine known as ''[[Pelorovis|Bubalus antiquus]]''.&lt;ref name="science blogs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nalsh|first=David|title=The ‘Great bubalus’ in ancient African rock art|url=http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2011/04/28/great-bubalus-rock-art/|publisher=Science Blogs|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The images are nearly life-sized and fairly [[Naturalism (arts)|naturalistic]] in style. The images have been carved in continuously flowing white lines that make it easy to forget that each image was painstakingly ground into the rock faces by hand. A distinct feature of this style is the outsized, rounded feet of the animals.

Other subjects depicted in the carvings include humans and animal-headed humans (a theme which is widespread in the [[Art of ancient Egypt]]). Men are shown armed with clubs, throwing sticks, axes and bows, but never spears.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hartford-hwp.com/image_archive/ta/tad.html&lt;/ref&gt; One image depicts a rhinoceros on its back, surrounded by jackal-headed humans armed with clubs. Interpretations of this image are up to debate, but some believe hunting scenes like these may refer to "[[Hunting magic]]," a ritualistic attempt to control the animals they hunted. Others think that the images are likely far more in-depth in religious meaning than that, but nothing has been determined with certainty in regard to an interpretation. We do know that the animal-headed humans depicted here definitely preceded those seen in Egypt.

After the [[Sahara]] became the desert we know today (ca., 1,000 BCE&lt;ref name="monica" /&gt;), most of its ancient inhabitants migrated to other parts of Africa, taking their culture with them. Many artistic styles throughout African history owe their origins to the early Saharan rock art.

The '''City Music Society''' was formed in [[London]], United Kingdom, in 1943. It was influenced by lunchtime concerts organised by [[Hilda Bor]] at the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] and by [[Myra Hess]] at the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]]. The driving force in the Society's foundation was [[Ivan Sutton]], with help and encouragement by Bor, who became its Vice-President, and from [[Edric Cundell]], Principal of the [[Guildhall School of Music]], who served as its first President. It was described in an obituary of Sutton as "one of the City of London's most remarkable institutions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960628/ai_n14046811 Obituary: Ivan Sutton] ''[[The Independent]]'', June 28, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first event, a lecture by Cundell, took place in December 1943 at the Guildhall School, shortly followed by the first concert, a performance by the [[Morley College Choir]], in January 1944. After subsequent Society concerts at the [[Chartered Insurance Institute]] and the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], Sutton succeeded in convincing the [[Goldsmiths' Company]] to allow the use of its hall for a series of three evening concerts in the autumn of 1946. In the autumn of 1947 the lunchtime concerts moved from the Guildhall School to the [[Bishopsgate Institute]] where the opening concert by [[Louis Kentner]] attracted a capacity audience. Since then evening concerts at Goldsmith's Hall and Tuesday lunchtime concerts at [[Bishopsgate Institute]] have provided the regular framework within which the work of the Society has evolved.
The Society, at present, stages around 26 concerts per year and has over 2000 lunchtime and early evening concerts to its credit. It completed its 60th-anniversary season in April 2004. As well as featuring well-established musicians, the Society's policy has always attempted to invite outstanding young professional artists who are at the beginning of their careers to perform at its concerts, many of whom have since attained international status. Furthermore, over the years the Society has commissioned many new works - on average one every three years - from a wide and diverse range of British composers, including [[Roger Smalley]], [[Nicholas Maw]], [[Diana Burrell]], [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Elizabeth Maconchy]], [[Phyllis Tate]], [[Robin Holloway]], [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]], [[Geoffrey Burgon]], [[Peter-Paul Nash]], [[Kevin Volans]] and [[Michael Berkeley]].

[[Image:Clement Scott.png|250px|thumb|right|Clement Scott, from a copy of the ''Theatre'' magazine, aged about 40]]

'''Clement William Scott''' (6 October 1841 – 25 June 1904) was an influential English theatre critic for the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and other journals, and a playwright, lyricist, translator and travel writer, in the final decades of the 19th century.  His style of criticism, acerbic, flowery and (perhaps most importantly) carried out on the first night of productions, set the standard for theatre reviewers through to today.

Scott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[George Bernard Shaw]] and others.  After he gave a particularly ill-considered 1898 interview, in which he attacked the morals of theatre people, especially actresses, he was forced to retire as a theatre critic and his reputation and prospects suffered badly until, by the end of his life, he was impoverished.

==Life and career==
Born the son of [[William Scott (Vicar of St Olave's, Jewry)|William Scott]], the perpetual curate of [[Hoxton]] in north London, Scott converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] before his 21st birthday. Educated at [[Marlborough College]], he became a civil servant, working in the [[War Office]] beginning in 1860.&lt;ref name=Burner&gt;Burner, Alma J. [http://www.lib.rochester.edu/index.cfm?PAGE=3493 "A Chapter of the London Stage: The Clement Scott Papers"], Vol. XXVII, Winter 1973–1974, No. 2, University of Rochester Library Bulletin, University of Rochester, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Emeljanow, Victor. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101035982/ "Scott, Clement William (1841–1904)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Encouraged to write by the humorist [[Tom Hood]] the younger, who also was a clerk in the War Office, Scott contributed to ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', ''Weekly Dispatch'', and to Hood's own paper, ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', where Scott and [[W. S. Gilbert]] were colleagues.  Scott's interest in writing and the theatre led him to brief dalliance with the failed ''Victoria Review''.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;

He became the dramatic writer for ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' in 1863 but held the position for only two years because of the intemperance of his published opinions and his unpopular praise of the French theatre.  In 1871, Scott began his nearly thirty years as a theatre critic with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. He also contributed regularly to ''The Theatre'', a magazine that he founded, and wrote sentimental poetry and song lyrics (including "[[Oh Promise Me]]"), which were often published in the magazine ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' by his friend, the editor, [[F. C. Burnand]].  Scott continued to work at the War Office until 1879, when he finally decided to earn his living entirely by writing.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

As well as criticism, Scott wrote plays, including ''The Vicarage'', ''The Cape Mail'', ''Anne Mié'', ''Odette'', and ''The Great Divorce Case''.  He wrote several English adaptations of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s plays, some of which were written in collaboration with [[B. C. Stephenson]], such as ''Nos intimes'' (as ''Peril'') and ''Dora'' (1878, as ''Diplomacy''). The latter was described by the theatrical paper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' as "the great dramatic hit of the season".&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 23 June 1878, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; It also played with success at [[Wallack's Theatre]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 7 April 1878, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Scott and Stephenson also wrote an English version of [[Ludovic Halévy|Halévy]] and [[Henri Meilhac|Meilhac]]'s libretto for [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]'s operetta ''Le Petit Duc'' (1878). Their adaptation so pleased the composer that he volunteered to write some new music for the English production.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 28 April 1878, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; For all of these, Scott adopted the pen name "Saville Rowe" (after [[Savile Row]]) to match Stephenson's pseudonym, "Bolton Rowe", another Mayfair street.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Gossip", ''The Era'', 24 September 1876, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces with Stephenson were produced by the [[Squire Bancroft|Bancrofts]], the producers of [[Thomas William Robertson|T. W. Robertson]]'s plays, which Scott admired. He also wrote accounts of holiday tours around the [[British Isles]] and abroad, becoming known for his florid style. Scott's travels also inspired his creative writing. Some sources say that after a tour of New Zealand, he wrote the tune to the "Swiss Cradle Song", later adapted as "[[Now Is the Hour (song)|Now Is the Hour]]"&lt;ref&gt;Scowcroft, Philip L. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/206.htm "A 206th Garland of British Composers], June 2001, MusicWeb International, accessed 1 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Haere Ra", the [[Māori people|Māori]] farewell song, which white New Zealanders "mistakenly thought [to be] an old Maori folksong".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,779550,00.html "Music: Now Is the Hour"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 19 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used for the hymn "Search Me, O God", with lyrics by [[J. Edwin Orr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hymntime.com/tch/htm/s/e/searchme.htm &amp;ldquo;Search Me, O God&amp;rdquo;] at the ''Cyber Hymnal''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Australian family has long claimed that the "Clement Scott" who wrote the tune is a pseudonym for a family member.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth, Terry.

===''Poppyland'' and later years===
In 1883, the ''Daily Telegraph'' printed an article which Scott had written about a visit to the north [[Norfolk]] coast. He became enamoured of the district and gave it the name ''[[Poppyland]]''.  His writing was responsible for members of the London theatre set visiting and investing in homes in the area.  Ironically, he was unhappy at the result of his popularisation of this previously pristine area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://norfolkcoast.co.uk/pasttimes/pt_louiejermy.htm "Norfolk History and Past Times – Louie Jeremy"], Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://norfolkcoast.co.uk/pasttimes/pt_gardenofsleep.htm "Norfolk History and Past Times – Garden of Sleep"], Norfolkcoast.co.uk, 2005, accessed 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Clement Scott.JPG|thumb|right|Clement Scott memorial at [[Cromer]], Norfolk]]
Scott married Isabel Busson du Maurier, the sister of [[George du Maurier]], and the couple had four children. She died in 1890, and he remarried Constance Margarite Brandon, an American journalist and actress, in San Francisco.  Scott's long-time wish to be elected a member of the famous literary gentlemen's club, the [[Garrick Club]] (to which [[Henry Irving]], Gilbert and [[Arthur Sullivan]], among many other notable men belonged), was finally realised in 1892. After an ill-considered 1898 interview in ''Great Thoughts'', Scott was forced to retire as a theatre critic and moved to [[Biarritz]] to write ''The Drama of Yesterday and Today''.  He then worked for a couple of years at the end of the century for the ''[[New York Herald]]'', later returning to London.  In 1900, he founded ''The Free Lance, a Popular Society and Critical Journal'', for writers who worked by the job, which he edited.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Scott fell into illness and poverty in his last years and died at his residence in [[Woburn Square]] at the age of 62.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1904/06/26/archives/death-of-clement-scott-once-powerful-theatrical-critic-expires-in.html "Death of Clement Scott"], ''The New York Times'', 26 June 1904, p. 7 (subscription required); and "A Dramatic End", ''London Evening News'', 25 June 1904, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style, controversies and influence==
[[File:Mr Clement Scott Plays on One String Now.png|thumb|upright|left|Scott playing the ''Daily Telegraph'' violin (1897)]]
Scott's position on the ''Daily Telegraph'' and the support of its proprietor, J. M. Levy, allowed him to pioneer the essay-style review of drama, which came to replace the earlier bare notices. His column of notes and reviews became very popular throughout Britain, and later his own magazine, ''The Theatre'', achieved wide circulation.  He wrote his theatre reviews immediately after he saw the opening night of a piece which, together with his short temper and his dislike of critic [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]], the chief English supporter of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], tended to involve him often in controversies.&lt;ref name=Burner/&gt;

Scott played an important part in encouraging a more attentive attitude by theatre audiences. In his early days, it was not uncommon for audiences to be very boisterous and noisy, frequently booing and talking during productions, especially through the overture. He also insisted on first night reviews.  It had been common for reviewers to wait a few days before writing about a production. Scott insisted that the paying audience on the first night should expect to see a fully fledged production, and not one where the leading characters did not know all their lines.  Theatre managers disliked the opening night reviews when they felt that a new piece had not had time to settle down yet.&lt;ref name=Gillan1&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-critic.html "The Fall of Clement Scott"], StageBeauty.net, 2007, accessed 13 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Scott supported actor-managers of his time by providing them with translations of popular French plays and with his own plays.

[[Image:Constable Clement Scott.png|thumb|upright|Scott in the ''Entr'acte'' in 1898, when he accused Ibsen and Shaw of being harmful to society]]
Early in his career, he wrote approvingly of the "cup and saucer" realism movement, led by T. W. Robertson, whose plays were notable for treating contemporary British subjects in realistic settings.  Later, he favoured the grand and spectacular type of London theatrical production which had developed with new types of theatre building, electric lighting and technologies allowed more and more adventurous staging.  As time went on, he became strongly conservative and opposed to the new drama of Ibsen and [[George Bernard Shaw|Shaw]], arguing that domestic intrigue, sexual situations and wordy philosophising were inappropriate for an evening at the theatre, and even harmful to society, especially young women. Scott especially became embroiled in legal claims through his outspoken criticism of various actors and actresses.  His scathing attacks on Ibsen and Shaw became evident in their lack of journalistic neutrality.&lt;ref name=Gillan1/&gt;

Scott outraged the theatre community with an extraordinary attack on the morals of theatre people in general, and especially of actresses, in an interview that was published in the evangelical weekly ''Great Thoughts'' in 1898. He said that the theatre warps people's character and that it was impossible for a pure woman to be successful in a stage career, and that all leading actresses were immoral and could have achieved their success only by virtue of the extent of their "compliance". Even before the publication, the transcript of the interview was released to the press, and Scott immediately received a firestorm of condemnation. Although he apologised and recanted his remarks, he was barred from theatres, and the ''Daily Telegraph'' was forced to dismiss him. He soon retired and found his reputation and prospects much diminished. By the end of his life, however, he received a measure of forgiveness, and shortly before his death the theatre community held a generous benefit for him.&lt;ref name=Gillan1/&gt;

His papers are located in the library of [[Rochester University]], New York State.  Film maker [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] (''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''Mrs. Brown'', ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'') made his first feature film for the BBC, ''Poppyland'' (1985), around the story of Scott's visit to Poppyland.

The '''''Deposition from the Cross''''' is a painting of the [[Deposition of Christ]] by the [[Italy|Italian]] Renaissance master [[Fra Angelico]], executed between 1432 and 1434. It is now housed in the National Museum of [[San Marco, Florence]].

[[Giorgio Vasari]] defined it to have been “painted by a saint or an angel”.

Angelico intervened to complete this altarpiece when it had been already begun by [[Lorenzo Monaco]] for the [[Strozzi Chapel]] in the Florentine church of [[Santa Trinita]]. It portrays Christ supported by several people, with [[Mary Magdalene]] keeping his feet, as a symbol of human repention. A figure on the right, with a red hat, is showing the cross' nails and the horns crown, symbols of passion and sacrifice.

[[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], wearing a dark dress, is shown  in the traditional gesture of keeping hands joined.

'''Drug Master File''' or '''DMF''' is a document prepared by a [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturer and submitted solely at its discretion to the appropriate regulatory authority in the intended drug market. There is no regulatory requirement to file a DMF. However, the document provides the regulatory authority with confidential, detailed information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs. Typically, a drug master file is filed when two or more firms work in partnership on developing or manufacturing a drug product. The DMF filing allows a firm to protect its [[intellectual property]] from its partner while complying with regulatory requirements for disclosure of processing details.

== Description ==
Drug Master File (DMF) is a document containing complete information on an [[Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient]] (API) or finished drug [[dosage form]]. An Active Substance Master File (ASMF) is the currently recognised term in Europe, formerly known as European Drug Master File (EDMF) or a US-Drug Master file (US-DMF) in the United States.

The DMF contains factual and complete information on a drug product's chemistry, manufacture, stability, purity, impurity profile, packaging,
and the [[Good manufacturing practice|cGMP]] status of any human drug product.

A drug master file comprises two parts: the Applicant’s Part (USA: Open Part), which contains all the information that the licence-holder needs to assess the quality and submit a licence or amendment application; and the Restricted Part (USA: Closed Part), which contains confidential information about the manufacturing procedure only disclosed to the authorities.

== DMFs in the United States ==
In the United States, DMFs are submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The Main Objective of the DMF is to support regulatory requirements and to prove the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for obtaining an [[Investigational New Drug]] Application (IND), a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA),As an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA), another DMF, or an Export Application.

In United States there are 5 types of Drug Master file:&lt;ref name="FDAguideDMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122886.htm|title=Guideline for Drug Master Files|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Type I Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures and Personnel

:* Type II Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product

:* Type III Packaging Material

:* Type IV Excipient, Colorant, Flavor, Essence, or Material Used in Their Preparation

:* Type V FDA Accepted Reference Information

== DMFs in Europe ==
The content and the format for drug master file used in United States differs from that used in [[List of European countries|European Countries]] to obtain market authorization (MA). The Main Objective of the EDMF is to support regulatory requirements of a medicinal product to prove its quality, safety and efficacy. This helps to obtain a Marketing Authorisation grant.

'''DMF LISTS'''

IMPORTANT NOTE

The current list contains DMFs RECEIVED by March 31, 2012. However the submitted date is listed for each DMF.

The list of DMFs is current as of March 31, 2012, through DMF 25923. Changes to the DMF activity status, DMF type, holder name, and subject made since the last update of January 11, 2012 are included.

The list is available in Microsoft Excel and in ASCII (tab-delimited).

The current lists are posted (1Q2012) as well as the lists from the last quarter (4Q2011) to permit users to compare lists for updates and changes.
'''
TYPES OF DMFs'''

The types of DMFs are:

Type I Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel (no longer applicable)
Type II Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product
Type III Packaging Material
Type IV Excipient, Colorant, Flavor, Essence, or Material Used in Their Preparation
Type V FDA Accepted Reference Information
STATUS OF DMFS

“A” = Active. This means that the DMF was found acceptable for filing, administratively, and is up-to-date.
“I” = Inactive
“N” = Not an assigned number
“P” = DMF Pending Filing Review
The status conveys no information about whether DMF has been reviewed for technical content.

'''INACTIVE STATUS OF DMFs'''

There are three reasons to list a DMF as inactive:
* The holder requested that the DMF be closed (or retired, closed, inactivated, or withdrawn) by submitting a closure request.
* The FDA closed the DMF because the holder did not respond to an overdue notification letter within 90 days by updating the DMF.
* The DMF was overdue for update. The FDA considers DMFs submitted before March 31 overdue for update when the company has submitted no annual reports since that date. The FDA considers only an annual report sufficient to prevent them sending an overdue notice letter (ONL).

The status ''Inactive'' in the list does not distinguish among the reasons listed above.

DMFs must be current at the time of review. According to FDA regulations regarding DMFs (21 CFR 314.420(c)):
:''“Any addition, change, or deletion of information in a drug master file (except the list required under paragraph (d) of this section) is required to be submitted in two copies and to describe by name, reference number, volume, and page number the information affected in the drug master file.”''
The Guideline for Drug Master Files (September 1989), recommends that DMF holders update their DMFs annually (see below under Annual reports).

To ensure DMFs are current, the FDA sends ''overdue notification letters'' (ONLs) to DMF holders for DMFs that are overdue for update (see above). If a DMF holder does not respond to this letter within 90 days by submitting an annual report, the FDA considers the DMF ''closed by the FDA,'' and ''retired''.

Note that the FDA has a backlog sending out ONLs. DMF holders can forestall the sending of an ONL by updating their DMFs, following the procedure below under ''Retaining the activity of a DMF.''

===Retiring DMFs===
A DMF can be retired only if it is closed. A retired DMF is unavailable for review.

===Retaining DMF activity===
A DMF holder that wants to retain the activity of a DMF listed as Inactive and not closed must submit an annual report (two copies). This is also the process used to respond to an ONL. The cover letter must specify that it is an ''annual report.''

===Reactivating a closed DMF===
A company can return a closed DMF to active status only by submitting a ''reactivation.'' The reactivation must contain a complete re-submission of the DMF, updated to meet current guidance.

===Guidance===
For drug master files, the version posted on the web is the current version. The address for submitting DMF documentation to the FDA in the Guidance is dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.

FDA regulations require that all foreign language submissions to INDs and NDAs have complete, accurate translations. The same is true for DMFs. The FDA does not require a [[certified translation]].

===More information about DMFs===
DMF guidance recommendations, in general, still apply. However, the information below provides additional information or clarification in three categories:
* Category 1: Recommendations no longer applicable due to changes in regulations or guidances
* Category 2: Additional clarification of recommendations in the Guidance
* Category 3: New information for DMF filing aspects not in effect when the company wrote the Guidance

Mailing address for filing original DMFs and all subsequent DMF documents (Category 3):
:Food and Drug Administration
:Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
:Central Document Room
:5901-B Amendale Road
:Beltsville MD 20705-1266

Companies send two paper copies of all submissions to an existing paper DMF to the address above. The FDA does not accept submissions via e-mail or CDs. Companies may submitted two-sided copies of DMFs.

===DMF reviews (Category 3)===
When the FDA receives a DMF, they review it for administrative content. This may take 2–3 weeks. If the DMF is acceptable from an administrative point of view, the FDA issues an acknowledgement letter, which notifies the holder of the DMF number. If the FDA finds the DMF not acceptable from an administrative view, they notify the holder of the deficiencies they must correct.

The FDA reviews the DMF for technical information only after the following events occur:

# The DMF holder submits a Letter of Authorization (LOA) in two copies to the FDA. This LOA must contain the DMF number.
# The holder sends a copy of the LOA to the authorized party (customer).
# The customer submits an application to the FDA that contains a copy of the LOA.

===Pre-assignment of DMF Numbers (Category 3)===
The FDA grants requests for preassigned DMF numbers for electronic or paper DMFs. (See ''Requesting a Pre-Assigned Application number.'')

===Format and content of the application's ''Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls'' section (Category 1)===
Companies submit DMFs following the format recommended in the ''Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality.''

===Conversion to Common Technical Document===
Companies may convert an existing DMF in non-CTD format to CTD format. In such cases, the FDA advises DMF holders to submit an amendment that contains all applicable CTD-specified sections to the material in the DMF. Each section must be complete and current. For drug substances and excipients, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.S in Module 3. For drug products, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.P in Module 3. If the reformatting causes changes in the DMFs technical content—e.g., adds new information—the cover letter for the new submission must describe these changes. DMFs in CTD format must follow CTD Guidance, e.g., be paginated within each section. This supersedes DMF guidance.

For conversion of a paper DMF to electronic CTD format, see Electronic DMF.

DMFs that cover multiple items, e.g., Type III DMFs for components of container-closure systems or Type IV DMFs for flavors, can be submitted in CTD format. Technical information can be in Module 3, following the outline in the Drug Substance Section. Sections within 3.2.S. can be populated as appropriate. Each product, such as different flavors, must have a different name—e.g. ''3.2.S.[Flavor 1], 3.2.S.[Flavor 2].'' Information common to different products—e.g., analytical procedures—can be accessed by reference (or links in the case of an Electronic DMF) from the relevant section for that product, e.g., ''3.2.4.2 [Flavor 1].''

DMF holders who submit DMFs for sterile manufacturing can consult the ''Manual of Policies and Procedures 5040.1: Product Quality Microbiology Information in the Common Technical Document - Quality (CTD-Q).'' Companies don't have to file separate sections for the same product manufactured at separate facilities unless the manufacturing processes are different.

Module 1 must contain the following information
Section 1.2: Cover Letter and Statement of Commitment
Section 1.3: Administrative Information

1.3.1 Contact/sponsor/Applicant information
1.3.1.1 Change of address or corporate name
Can be used to supply addresses of DMF holder and manufacturing and testing facilities

1.3.1.2 Change in contact/agent
Can be used to supply the name and address of contact persons and/or agents, including Agent Appointment Letter.
1.4.1 - Letter of Authorization (LOA)
Submission by the owner of information, giving authorization for the information to be used by another. An Agent Appointment Letter is NOT an LOA and should not be called “Letter of Authorization” and should not be submitted in Section 1.4.1
1.4.2 - Statement of Right of Reference
Submission by recipient of a Letter of Authorization with a copy of the LOA and statement of right of reference. Submitted in a DMF only when another DMF is referenced.
1.4.3 - List of authorized persons to incorporate by reference
This list should be submitted in DMF annual reports.
Section 1.12.14 Environmental Analysis: See Environmental Assessment

The language in the following sentence in the DMF Guidance, Section VII.B.1, has confused some DMF holders:

:''“A DMF is required to contain a complete list of persons authorized to incorporate information in the DMF by reference [21 CFR 314.420(d)].”''
It does not mean to say that a company must list all individuals in the DMF holder’s company who are authorized to submit information to the DMF.

The language in the CFR is clearer:

:''“The drug master file is required to contain a complete list of each person currently authorized to incorporate by reference any information in the file, identifying by name, reference number, volume, and page number the information that each person is authorized to incorporate.”''

==Types of DMFs==
'''&lt;u&gt;Type I DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

The FDA no longer accepts Type I DMFs, per a final rule published on January 12, 2000 (65 FR 1776). See Type V DMFs below.

Holders of Type II, III, and IV DMFs must not place information regarding facilities, personnel, or general operating procedures in these DMFs. They should only submit DMF holder addresses, manufacturing sites, and contact personnel. See ''Administrative Information in a DMF.''

'''&lt;u&gt;Type II DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

For Type II DMFs filed in CTD-Q format, the FDA expects Module 2.

Drug Substance
Type II DMFs for drug substances may be submitted in the format for "Drug substance" in the "Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality".(Category 3) Drug Substance:
See the current Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances.
It is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.S.4.3.
See also the DRAFT ICH Guidance “Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances
Drug Product:
Type II DMFs for drug products may be submitted in the format for "Drug product" in the "Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality".(Category 3) Drug Product.
See the Guideline For Submitting Supporting Documentation In Drug Applications For The Manufacture Of Drug Products.
It is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.P.5.3.

Examples of drugs that would be classified as Type II DMFs include Amifostine, Caffeine, Desonide Micro, Ibuprofen Softgels, Viatmin E Oil, and Zinc Gluconate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type2|title=DMF Type II Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate DMFs should be submitted for drug substances and drug products.

'''&lt;u&gt;Type III DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

The applicable Guidance for Type III DMFs is the “Guidance for Industry: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation” and Questions and Answers. (Category 3)

A Manual of Policies and Procedures covering reviewer responsibilities for review of Type III DMFs has been implemented. MAPP 5015.5 CMC Reviews of Type III DMFs for Packaging Materials This MAPP instructs reviewers to look for information regarding many packaging materials in the application (IND, NDA, ANDA) for the drug product that utilizes the packaging material before reviewing the DMF. Much of the information needed for review can be provided directly to the applicant for inclusion in the application, thereby avoiding the need to review the DMF.

Examples of products that would be classified as Type III DMFs include bottles, seals, dispensers, and vials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type3?lang=en|title=DMF Type III Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Type IV DMFs (Category 3)&lt;/u&gt;'''

Type IV DMFs should be used for products such as excipients, colorants, flavors, essences, or other materials used in product preparation. Examples of materials that would use a Type IV DMF include bases, waxes, and edible inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type4?lang=en|title=DMF Type IV Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See relevant section in the Guideline for Drug Master Files. Toxicology studies may be submitted in the same DMF as the CMC information but they should be in a separate volume or volumes. It is preferable for holders to submit such information as a separate Type V DMF. See also the “Guidance for Industry: Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients
Type V DMFs (Category 3)

The following types of DMFs may be filed as '''&lt;u&gt;Type V DMFs&lt;/u&gt;''' without requesting prior clearance from FDA.

Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel for sterile manufacturing plants. See Guidance for Industry for the Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products.
Contract Facilities for the manufacture of biotech products. See Draft Guidance for Industry: Submitting Type V Drug Master Files to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
For other submissions as Type V DMFs the holder must request permission from FDA before filing a Type V DMF. (21 CFR 314.420(a)(5)). Prospective Type V DMF holders may send their request to dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov, explaining the necessity for filing the information in a Type V DMF.

Examples of sites and procedures that would require Type V DMFs include clinical studies, sterilization facilities, and toxicological information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type5?lang=en|title=DMF Type V Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Administrative Information in a DMF''' (Category 3)

The only elements of the administrative information that should be in a DMF are:

The name and address of the holder
The name and address of manufacturing facility
For the contact person:
Name
Mailing Address
Telephone number
Fax number
E-mail address
Statement of Commitment
The name and address of the agent (if applicable)
For the contact person at the agent (if applicable):
Name
Mailing Address
Telephone number
Fax number
E-mail address
The appointment of an Agent is optional. See discussion below under “Agents”

Submission of Amendments, Annual Reports, and Letters of Authorization(Category 3)

To facilitate processing of documents that are submitted to an existing DMF, please list the Submission Type and the Category/Subcategory of the Amendment (Supporting Document) in bold type in the header on the transmittal letter. See list below. More than one Submission Type/Category/Subcategory can be used but all must be listed.

Example: If updated stability data is submitted at the same time as an Annual Report, the heading of the Cover Letter should state:

Annual Report
Original: Quality/Stability

FDA’s database is structured as follows:

Application:
Submission
Amendment (called "Supporting Document") in the database)
Amendments (Supporting Documents) are named by a Category and Subcategory

For the Application Type “Drug Master File” the Submission Types are

Original: Information containing changes to technical information are filed in the “Original” submission. For Categories and Subcategories, see list below. Note that a new DMF does not need a “Category” designation by the holder.
Annual Report: There are no Amendments (Supporting Documents) Categories and Subcategories
Letter of Authorization: There is only one Category with two Subcategories:
Letter of Authorization
Withdrawal of Authorization
Categories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in General Information
Category: Closure Request
Category: Reactivation (Used only when a DMF has been Closed.)
Category: Administrative

Subcategories under Administrative Category
change in the holder name
change in holder address
change in ownership of the DMF (either internal name change, or change in ownership)
change in the agent name or address.
change in the contact person at the holder or agent.
change in the subject of the DMF.
change in the type of DMF
Categories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in Original Submission:

Category: Quality

Subcategories under Quality Category (with corresponding CTD Sections, where applicable).

Changes to a Subsection e.g. changes in Control of Materials (S.2.3) not specifically listed below should be reported as the next level up e.g. should be reported as Manufacture Information S.2.

New item: Additional item e.g. flavor added to a multi-item DMF
Controls Information (specifications) S.4 and P.5
Dissolution Data (Usually applies to drug product only) P.5
Facility Information (changes in manufacturing and or testing sites) S.2.1 and P.3.1
Formulation Information (Usually applies to drug product only) P.1 and related sections
Lot Release (batch analysis) S.4.4 and P.5.4
Manufacture Information S.2 and P.3
Microbiology Information
New Strength (Usually applies to drug product only) P.1 and related sections
Quality (Not covered by other subcategories)
Packaging Information (Applies to packaging of the material that is the subject of the DMF e.g. plastic bags for packaging a bulk drug substance in a Type II DMF) S.6 and P.7
Stability Information S.7 and P.8
Response to Information Request
Response to Deficiency Letter

Category: Non-clinical
Non-clinical
Carcinogenicity Information
A response to an Overdue Notice Letter (ONL) to retain activity of a DMF MUST be identified as an Annual Report (with additional amendments as applicable) and contain the information listed below for an Annual Report. Responses to ONLs that are not labeled as Annual Reports or that state that an update will be submitted in the future are NOT sufficient to keep the DMF in active status.

FDA does not acknowledge, whether via e-mail or letter, any submission after the original DMF.

Submissions that cover multiple DMFs MUST have a copy submitted for each DMF.

When a company changes one part of a DMF, they should not resubmit the entire DMF. For DMFs in CTD format, the company should resumbit the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires that the company resumbit ''Section S.2.3.''

All submissions must be paginated within the submission. For DMFs in CTD format, the company only resubmits the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires resubmitting ''Section S.2.3.''

Pages that replace an already-numbered page from a previous submission should also contain the page number in the current submission (e.g. a page replacing Page 10 in the original submission may be page 14 in the new submission). For DMFs in CTD format, only the pages within the changed “Document” (Section) are subject to re-numbering.`

No pages are ever physically replaced in a DMF.

===Electronic DMFs (Category 3)===
At this time, the FDA doesn't ''require'' that companies file DMFs electronically. They continue to accept paper DMFs. Beginning May 5, 2017 new DMFs and submissions to existing DMFs must be submitted using the eCTD standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM511231.pdf |title=Forms|website=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD)'

All electronic submissions must have a pre-assigned number to populate in the US regional.xml. If a company converts a paper DMF to electronic format, they don't need to request a pre-assigned number.

See also Guidance for Industry: Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format—Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications. To make sure you have the most recent versions of the specifications referenced in this guidance please check Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD). Companies are encouraged to submit their DMFs in electronic form, including updating current paper DMFs. Note that all applications to CDER, including DMFs that are submitted in electronic format MUST be in ECTD format, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers are not granted for DMFs.

All Letters of Authorization for electronic DMFs should specify that the DMF has been submitted in electronic format. A company may not submit an electronic resubmission to a paper DMF unless they resubmit the entire DMF in electronic format. Companies may convert an existing DMF in paper format to electronic format (ECTD only). See “Conversion to CTD” above.

The ECTD format provides the backbone for the submission, and a guide as to where to place information. Companies need not submit all modules, nor submit all sections within a module. However, the FDA requires Module 1 for all eCTD submissions, as it contains the administrative information that identifies the DMF. Electronic signatures are accepted for electronic DMFs.

===Letters of authorization (Category 2)===
The company must submit two copies of all letters of authorization (LOAs) to the DMF. The DMF holder must then send a copy of the LOA to the authorized party (company or individual authorized to incorporate the DMF by reference). Failure to submit the LOA to the DMF may delay review of the DMF. LOAs must specify the name of the specific item referenced, and the date of the submission of information about that item. The LOA must not be called a ''letter of access.'' An LOA is required, even if the DMF holder is the same company as the authorized party.

Companies must not submit LOAs with original paper DMFs, because the LOA must contain the DMF number. Therefore, DMF holders must wait to submit an LOA until they receive an acknowledgment letter with the DMF number. An LOA can be submitted with the original DMF if the DMF has received a pre-assigned number. It is not necessary to reissue LOAs if there have been no changes in the holder, authorized party, subject of the DMF or item referenced.

If the holder or authorized party changes names, whether this represents a change in ownership or not, they should submit new LOAs to the DMF and copies sent to the authorized party.

LOA Template
AGENTS (Category 2)

There is no regulatory requirement for an agent for any DMF, foreign or domestic. An agent for DMF purposes is not the same as an agent for the purposes of the Drug Listing and Registration System. (DRLS). Holders should not include the name of the agent for Registration purposes in the DMF. Also note that in the US, the process of “Registration” applies ONLY to “registering” an establishment with the FDA.

All “Agent Appointment Letters” for DMFs MUST be sent by the holder. FDA recommends that such letters include the phrase “appoint AGENT NAME as the agent for DMF” rather than “authorize AGENT NAME to act as the agent for DMF,” since the latter can be confused with a “Letter of Authorization.”
An “Agent Appointment Letter” may be included in an original DMF.

If possible, the word “Agent” should be used for the legal entity (whether a company or an individual) who is authorized to act on behalf of the DMF holder. The word “Representative” should be used for an individual who is employed by the Agent or Holder as the contact point for FDA.

If a company acting as an Agent changes its name, FDA recommends that the DMF holder issue a new Agent Appointment Letter.

A different agent can be appointed for different DMFs submitted by the same holder.

Agent Appointment Template
HOLDER NAMES (Category 2)

When the company that owns a DMF (DMF holder) changes its name, whether through sale of the company or simply a change in the company’s name, the DMF holder must notify FDA. See Section VII.E. in the Guideline for DMFs for further recommendations on the procedure for transferring ownership. A change in the name of a company for registration purposes under DRLS will not change the DMF holder name.

When a DMF is transferred from one company to another, the original holder should submit an administrative amendment stating that they are TRANSFERRING the DMF to the new holder. The new holder should then submit an administrative amendment stating that they are ACCEPTING the DMF from the former holder.

If the DMF holder changes its name and there is no transfer of ownership, the holder may submit a single Holder Name Change amendment.

A DMF holder is expected to retain a complete reference copy that is identical to, and maintained in the same chronological order as, their submissions to FDA (See Section IV.D.1 in the Guideline for DMFs). Therefore, the old owner of the DMF is expected to transfer that copy to the new owner of the DMF.

If a holder name change affects multiple DMFs, all documentation must be submitted to each DMF as separate submissions.

In general, the FDA expects that the manufacturer is the holder. If a manufacturer (company A) of a material wants another company (Company B) to submit the DMF, and Company B wishes to act as the holder—the DMF must include statements from both companies that Company B is responsible for all information in the DMF, and for all processes and testing performed by the manufacturer. The title of the DMF that appears on the list of DMFs is the format ''Material manufactured in [LOCATION OF COMPANY A] for [COMPANY B].''

ANNUAL REPORTS (Category 2)

According to the DMF Guideline, companies must not use annual reports to report changes in the DMF. However, as described above, companies can submit an annual report at the same time as other information. The annual report must contain (for cover letter see Templates below):

1. An administrative page that contains:

: Holder name
: Manufacturing site name if different from holder
: U.S. agent company name (if applicable)
: Name of contact person for each of the above
: Mailing address, phone number, fax and email address of responsible individuals
: AND 2. One of the following

: Date(s) of the amendment(s) reporting changes since the last Annual Report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.

: Or

: A statement that no amendments have been submitted since the last Annual Report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.
: And

: 3. One of the following:

: A complete list of all parties authorized to make reference to the DMF, identifying by name, reference number, volume, date, and page number the information that each person is authorized to incorporate

: Or

: A statement that no changes have been made to the list of authorized parties since the last annual report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.

: Or

: A statement that there are no authorized parties.

: And 
: 4. List of all parties whose authorization has been withdrawn

Note that the DMF Guidance uses the terms “Annual Update” and “Annual Report” interchangeably. All submissions of Annual Reports should be labeled “Annual Report.” The term “Annual Update” should not be used.

Note that the annual report must list the authorized parties. If the list is long and the holder wants to list only authorized parties added since the last annual report, they should highlight this in the cover letter. There should be a statement that there have been no changes in the list of authorized parties previously submitted.

BIOLOGICS MASTER FILES (Category 3)

Master Files submitted in support of products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) must be submitted as BB-MFs. See the CBER web site for the products regulated by CBER.

 BINDERS (Category 2)

See ”FDA IND, NDA, ANDA, or Drug Master File Binders
“The “binders” are actually covers. These may be ordered from the

U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO)
Washington, DC 20404-0001
(202) 512-1800

In addition these can be ordered online using the following links

Red Binder
Blue Binder
One copy of the DMF should use the blue cover and one should use the red cover.

Fasteners must be obtained separately. Use 2 Piece Prong Fasteners, 8 1/2" Center to Center, 3 1/2" Capacity. Binders should be used for all subsequent submissions to FDA that are more than 10 pages.

FEES (Category 3)

There are no fees or charges for filing a DMF or any subsequent documents.

FORMS (Category 2)

Certain forms are required for submission of NDAs and INDs. However, there are no forms required or available for DMFs, except for the forms discussed above under Binders.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF DMFs (Category 2)

The public availability of the contents of DMFs is covered in 21 CFR 314.430(e). All requests for information about DMFs beyond that provided in the tables above must be made through the CDER Freedom of Information Web site.
FILING DMFs AND PATENT EXPIRATION AND EXCLUSIVITY ISSUES (Category 2)

DMFs may be filed at any time. The Patent Expiration date and the Exclusivity Expiration dates listed in the Orange Book have no impact on DMF filing. The submission of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) that reference DMFs are subject to the regulations regarding filing of ANDAs.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS (Category 2) Since DMFs are neither approved nor disapproved, there is no need to file an Environmental Assessment. However the DMF should contain a commitment by the firm that its facilities will be operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws.

REORGANIZATION OF A DMF (Category 1)
The advice in the Guidance does not apply. It is not necessary to consult with FDA before reorganizing a DMF.

REQUEST FOR CLOSURE OF A DMF BY THE HOLDER (Category 2).

It is not necessary to include a statement that "the holder's obligations as detailed in Section VII have been fulfilled," as recommended in the DMF Guidance. It is sufficient to include a statement that all of the parties authorized to reference the DMF have been notified that the DMF is being closed..

LETTER TEMPLATES AND COVER LETTERS (Category 2)

Note that a “Transmittal Letter” and a “Cover Letter” are the same thing.

Cover Letter for Original DMFs
Cover Letter for Subsequent Amendments and Annual Reports (Not applicable to Holder Transfer, New Holder Acceptance, Holder Name Change, Letter of Authorization, and Closure Requests)

Cover Letter for Reactivation of a Closed Drug Master File
The following Letters do not require a Cover Letter

Holder Transfer
New Holder Acceptance
Holder Name Change
Letter of Authorization
Closure Request
Withdrawal of Authorization

'''FRIKAR dance company''' (established May 2006 by Hallgrim Hansegård) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] dance company for contemporary and traditional dance specializing in the connection between dance and nature.

==History==
'''FRIKAR dance company''' was founded by choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård in 2006, and has toured 29 countries all over the world. The company is described by National Geographic as "wildly inventive" and is composed by 32 artists from 4 continents (India, Iran, Somalia, Brazil, Cape Verde, France, Sweden, Norway.) The artists from very diverse genres meet each other in the research of gravity and human nature.

With a background in Norwegian traditional dance choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård founded FRIKAR dance company to give acrobatic dancers living in Norway a creative environment. Together with the dancers he has been developing a new choreographical style for contemporary dance called "Down2Earth" including [[Hallingdans]]  [[Capoeira]] and [[break dance]]. He works in the formats of aerial dance, site specific ecosophical stage arts, indoor dance and interdiciplinary arts.

Hansegård made his international breakthrough with an animation film at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2003 (Tarantrance). In 2005 he won 3rd prize at Superdok. In 2007 he was awarded "Artist of the Year" at The Norwegian Folk Music Awards. In 2009 he won the "Award for best choreography" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], among 43 countries in the most seen entertainment TV program in the world.

In 2010 he premiered "Jamsiis" at Bergen International Festival [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHSLBUOm9nc Youtube: Jamsiis]. This was a highly personal contribution to the Nordic contemporary dance scene, based on his roots in traditional dances. Jamsiis opened up a public discussion about the boundaries of contemporary dance in Norway. NRK (the Norwegian Broadcasting) writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;JAMSIIS, Hallgrim Hansegårds new production, is the most exciting I have seen here. It’s very exciting to see traditional dance in dialogue with contemporary dance. Hansegård is branching out and opening up new territory here. He has come down a path that I think is very important to go. That Hansegård is a dancer with strong will to do his own thing and blessedly uninhibited as far as exceeding boundaries is concerned is something the Norwegian dance community should be happy about… At the same time that he approaches contemporary dance, he opens doors. If he succeeds in making contemporary dance accessible to a wider audience than today’s, the genre of contemporary dance should learn to endure a ‘halling-roundkick’ or two.&lt;ref&gt;Dance critic Karen Frøsland Nystøyl, NRK kulturnytt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009 Hansegård directed TidarÅ, an outdoor full night dance performance under a waterfall with 22 dancers and musicians from FRIKAR dance company. The production collected contemporary and traditional dancers in a research for a unique contemporary dance technique. "Tidarå" is part of FRIKARs ecosophical productions. Hansegård directed also Yr in 2009 together with violin virtous Ragnhild Hemsing, premiere at the [[Bergen International Festival]].

In 2008 FRIKAR was censored by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Naples]] for his non conventional interpretation of Peer Gynt, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsip8vvC7gY NRK: Bukkerittet]. In the years 2005 to 2007 Hansegård directed "Undergrunnsfargo", "Isolations", "Laus", "Kruk", "The snuff grinders" and "Bastard".

He also participated in ''[[Dansefeber]]'', the Norwegian version of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'', in 2006.&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite book |title=Hvem er hvem? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2008 |editor=Knut Olav Åmås |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-03-23561-0 |language=Norwegian |page=211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, his dancing was digitalized for the [[MMORPG|massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) [[Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/kul_und/spill/article2351271.ece|title=Et kast for Conan|work=[[Aftenposten]]|date=6 April 2008|first=Per Kristian|last=Bjørkeng|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dans, estetikk og samfunn"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dans, estetikk og samfunn? |last= |first= |authorlink= |year=2010 |editor=Heidi Haraldsen |publisher=Tell Forlag |location=Oslo |isbn=978-82-7522-351-5 |language=Norwegian |pages=10, 25, 26, 51, 52, 57, 58.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21101">The '''Genesis Foundation''' is an arts project based in the [[United Kingdom]] and the principal activity of The Studs Trust, a [[registered charity]].

Established by [[John J. Studzinski|John Studzinski]] in 2001, the Genesis Foundation works in partnership with the leaders of UK arts organisations including LAMDA, the National Theatre, Royal Court, The Sixteen and the Young Vic.  Its largest funding commitment is to programmes that support directors, playwrights, actors and musicians in the early stages of their professional lives.

The theme of art &amp; faith increasingly characterises aspects of the Foundation’s work with choral commissions including [[James MacMillan]]’s [[Stabat Mater|Stabat mater]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boosey.com/cr/music/James-MacMillan-Stabat-Mater/58135|title=James MacMillan - Stabat Mater|website=www.boosey.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the sponsorship of the [[British Museum]]’s Living with Gods exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/stabat-mater/living-with-gods-peoples-places-and-worlds-beyond-at-the-british-museum-2/|title=Living with gods: peoples, places and worlds beyond at the British Museum|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/living_with_gods.aspx|title=Living with gods|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Genesis Foundation was founded in January 2001 by [[investment banker]] and [[arts patron]] John J. Studzinski, CBE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/john-studzinski/|title=John Studzinski|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then it has donated over £13 million primarily to its partner organisations to develop and mentor artistic talent from diverse backgrounds. The Foundation spends up to £1 million annually on its ongoing programmes with its partner organisations, all of which operate under the leadership of inspired artistic directors.

In October 2017 John Studzinski received the 2017 UK Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award for his work with the Genesis Foundation and its support of young artistic talent through long-term partnerships with artistic leaders. Others receiving the annual award include the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]], [[Simon Rattle|Sir Simon Rattle]], [[Renzo Piano]] and [[Yoko Ono]].

==Partner organisations==

===London Academy of Dramatic Art===
25 students have been awarded Genesis [[scholarships]] over the past 20 years at [[LAMDA]], the oldest [[drama school]] in the United Kingdom. Past LAMDA scholars include [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]], [[Tom Riley (actor)|Tom Riley]] and [[Ben Aldridge (actor)|Ben Aldridge]].

In 2017 the scholarship programme was replaced by the Genesis Network which provides mentoring to LAMDA final year students by pairing them with a graduate mentor to support them as they complete their training and enter the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lamda.ac.uk/our-courses/genesis-lamda-network|title=Genesis LAMDA Network {{!}} LAMDA|website=www.lamda.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sixteen===
Since 2010, the Genesis Foundation has collaborated with British [[chamber choir]] [[The Sixteen]] and funded Genesis Sixteen, the annual free young artists’ scheme for 18-23 year old ensemble singers. Genesis Sixteen provides group tuition, individual mentoring and masterclasses run by vocal experts.

The Genesis Foundation also [[Commission (art)|commissions]] new choral pieces from leading and emerging composers, which are then premiered and recorded by [[Harry Christophers]] and The Sixteen for their record label CORO. The world premiere of James MacMillan’s Stabat mater, a 60-minute work for choir and string orchestra commissioned by the Genesis Foundation, was given its UK premiere by Harry Christophers, The Sixteen and [[Britten Sinfonia]] at the Barbican Centre, London in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/press/reviews-james-macmillan-stabat-mater/|title=Reviews for James MacMillan Stabat Mater|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its recording was favourably reviewed, and it won numerous awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/press/reviews-for-james-macmillan-stabat-mater-recording/|title=Reviews for James MacMillan: Stabat Mater recording|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 it became the first concert to be live-streamed from the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/stabat-mater/|title=Stabat mater|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/press/the-vatican-premiere-of-stabat-mater-in-the-sistine-chapel/|title=The Vatican premiere of&amp;nbsp;Stabat mater&amp;nbsp;in the Sistine Chapel|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, four new commissions led by Sir James MacMillan were premiered at [[Eton College Chapel]] and live-streamed. The commissions were all based on texts from the [[Eton Choirbook]] and were performed alongside works from the [[Choirbook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genesisfoundation.org.uk/news/the-eton-choirbook-and-its-legacy-of-sacred-music-a-new-work-by-sir-james-macmillan-cbe-and-three-other-new-genesis-foundation-commissions-from-philip-cooke-marco-galvani-joseph-phibbs/|title=THE ETON CHOIRBOOK AND ITS LEGACY OF SACRED MUSIC A new work by Sir James MacMillan CBE And three other new Genesis Foundation commissions from Philip Cooke, Marco Galvani &amp; Joseph Phibbs|website=www.genesisfoundation.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday 9 February 2016 the Genesis Foundation, in collaboration with the Choral Foundation, brought together leaders of the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Church of England]] for the first service according to the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church to be celebrated since the 1550s at [[Hampton Court Palace]]’s Chapel Royal.

The Vespers’ service was  performed by Harry Christophers, The Sixteen and Genesis Sixteen. The ensembles sang [[Thomas Tallis]]’s ''Magnificat'', [[William Cornysh]]'s ''Salve Regina'' and [[John Taverner]]’s ''‘Leroy’ Kyrie.'' Members of the public were offered the chance to attend the service through a free ballot hosted by [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].

The service was celebrated by[[Vincent Nichols|Cardinal Vincent Nichols]] and included a sermon from [[Richard Chartres]], KCVO, Bishop of London and Dean of Her Majesty’s Chapels Royal – Vespers was dedicated to [[John the Baptist]]. Prior to the service, the Cardinal and Dean were in conversation under the heading ''Faith and the Crown'' in Hampton Court Palace’s ''Great Hall''. Their discussion addressed the relationship between the two churches and [[Monarchy|the monarchy]].

[[File:The Golden Age (fresco by Pietro da Cortona).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Golden Age'' by [[Pietro da Cortona]] ([[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]]).]]

The term '''Golden Age'''  comes from [[Greek mythology]], particularly the ''[[Works and Days]]'' of [[Hesiod]], and is part of the description of temporal decline of the state of peoples through five [[Ages of Man|Ages]], [[Gold]] being the first and the one during which the Golden Race of humanity ({{Lang-el|χρύσεον γένος}} ''chrýseon génos'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Hesiod]]|title=[[Works and Days]]|chapter=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; lived. Those living in the  first Age were ruled by [[Cronus|Kronos]], after the finish of the first age was the [[Silver age|Silver]], then the [[Bronze Age (mythology)|Bronze]], after this the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic]] age, with the fifth and current age being [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron]].&lt;ref&gt; Robin Hard - [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology: Based on H.J. Rose's "Handbook of Greek Mythology"], [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=The+Golden+age+in+Greek+mythology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3gP-h9tvTAhVLbBoKHWhQDkwQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Golden%20age%20in%20Greek%20mythology&amp;f=false p.69-70], [[Psychology Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0415186366}}, Accessed 2017-06-May&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension "Golden Age" denotes a period of primordial [[peace]], [[harmony]], [[ecological stability|stability]], and [[prosperity]]. During this age peace and harmony prevailed, people did not have to work to feed themselves, for the earth provided food in abundance. They lived to a very old age with a youthful appearance, eventually dying peacefully, with spirits living on as "guardians". [[Plato]] in ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' (397 e) recounts the golden race of humans who came first. He clarifies that Hesiod did not mean literally made of gold, but good and noble.

In classical Greek mythology the Golden Age was presided over by the leading [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greek Myths|publisher=Penguin Books | author=Gravity, Grass|year=1960|location=London|pages=35–37|isbn=9780140171990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some version of the myth [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] also ruled. She lived with men until the end of the Silver Age, but in the Bronze Age, when men became violent and greedy, fled to the stars, where she appears as the constellation [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]], holding the scales of Justice, or [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Hesiod calls [Astraea] the daughter of Jove and Themis. Aratus says that she is thought to be the daughter of Astraeus and Aurora, who lived at the time of the Golden Age of men and was their leader. On account of her carefulness and fairness she was called Justice, and at that time no foreign nations were attacked in war, nor did anyone sail over the seas, but they were wont to live their lives caring for their fields. But those born after their death began to be less observant of duty and more greedy, so that Justice associated more rarely with men. Finally the disease became so extreme that it was said the Brazen Race was born; then she could not endure more, and flew away to the stars." ([[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica2.html#25 Astronomica 2]).&lt;/ref&gt;

European [[pastoral]] literary tradition often depicted nymphs and shepherds as living a life of rustic innocence and peace, set in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], a region of Greece that was the abode and center of worship of their tutelary deity, goat-footed [[Pan (god)|Pan]], who dwelt among them.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Ann Henish, ''The Medieval Calendar Year'' ({{ISBN|0-271-01904-2}}), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Golden Age in Europe: Greece==
The earliest attested reference to the European myth of the [[Ages of Man]] 500 BCE–350 BCE appears in the late 6th century BCE works of the [[Greek language|Greek]] poet [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (109–126). Hesiod, a deteriorationist, identifies the Golden Age, the [[Silver age|Silver Age]], the Bronze Age, the [[Greek Heroic Age|Heroic Age]], and the [[Iron Age (mythology)|Iron Age]]. With the exception of the Heroic Age, each succeeding age was worse than the one that went before. Hesiod maintains that during the Golden Age, before the invention of the arts, the earth produced food in such abundance that there was no need for agriculture:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Men] lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all devils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Plato]] in his ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' referred to an age of golden men and also at some length on Ages of Man from Hesiod's ''Works and Days''. The Roman poet [[Ovid]] simplified the concept by reducing the number of Ages to four: Gold, Bronze, Silver, and Iron. Ovid's poetry, known to schoolboys from Antiquity through the Middle Ages and beyond,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} was likely a prime source for the transmission of the myth of the Golden Age during the period when Western Europe had lost direct contact with Greek literature.

[[File:Goldenes-Zeitalter-1530-2.jpg|thumb|right|''The Golden Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].]]

In Hesiod's version, the Golden Age ended when the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Prometheus]] conferred on mankind the gift of fire and all the other arts. For this, [[Zeus]] punished Prometheus by chaining him to a rock in the [[Caucasus]], where an eagle eternally ate at his liver. The gods sent the beautiful maiden [[Pandora]] to Prometheus's brother [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. The gods had entrusted Pandora with [[Pandora's box|a box]] that she was forbidden to open; however, her uncontrollable curiosity got the better of her and she opened the box, thereby unleashing all manner of evil into the world.

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic school]], a [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] that originated in [[Thrace]] and spread to Greece in the 5th century BCE, held similar beliefs about the early days of man, likewise denominating the ages with metals. In common with the many other mystery cults prevalent in the Graeco-Roman world (and their Indo-European religious antecedents), the [[world view]] of Orphism was cyclical. Initiation into its secret rites, together with ascetic practices, was supposed to guarantee the individual's soul eventual release from the grievous circle of mortality and also communion with god(s). Orphics sometimes identified the Golden Age with the era of the god [[Phanes (mythology)|Phanes]], who was regent over the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] before Cronus. In [[classical mythology]] however, the Golden Age was associated with the reign of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]. In the 5th century BCE, the philosopher [[Empedocles]], like Hesiod before him, emphasized the idea of primordial innocence and harmony in all of nature, including human society, from which he maintained there had been a steady deterioration until the present.

===Arcadia===
A tradition arose in Greece that the site of the original Golden Age had been [[Arcadia]], an impoverished rural area of Greece where the herdsmen still lived on acorns and where the goat-footed god Pan had his home among the poplars on Mount [[Maenalus]]. However, in the 3rd century BCE, the Greek poet, [[Theocritus]], writing in [[Alexandria]], set his pastoral poetry in on the lushly fertile island of Sicily, where he had been born. The protagonist of Theocritus's first [[Idyll]], the goat herder, [[Daphnis]], is taught to play the [[Syrinx]] (panpipes) by Pan himself. [[File:PanandDaphnis.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Sculpture of [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] teaching [[Daphnis]] to play the pipes; c. 100 BCE Found in [[Pompeii]].]]

==The Golden Age in Rome: Virgil and Ovid==
Writing in Latin during the turbulent period of revolutionary change at the end of the [[Roman Republic]] (roughly between 44 and 38 BCE), the poet [[Virgil]] moved the setting for his pastoral imitations of Theocritus back to an idealized Arcadia in Greece, thus initiating a rich and resonant tradition in subsequent European literature.

Virgil, moreover, introduced into his poetry the element of political allegory, which had been largely absent in Theocritus, even intimating in his fourth [[Eclogue]] that a new Golden Age of peace and justice was about to return:
&lt;poem&gt;''Ultima Cumaei venit iam carminis aetas;
''magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo:
''iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;
''iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;'''Translation:'''
''Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung
''Has come and gone, and the majestic roll
''Of circling centuries begins anew:
''Astraea returns,
''Returns old Saturn's reign,
''With a new breed of men sent down from heaven.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eclogues|Eclogue]] (lines [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0056&amp;layout=&amp;loc=4.1 5-8)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Somewhat later, shortly before he wrote his epic poem the ''[[Aeneid]]'', which dealt with the establishment of Roman Imperial rule, Virgil composed his ''[[Georgics]]'' (29 BCE), modeled directly on Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' and similar Greek works. Ostensibly about agriculture, the ''Georgics'' are in fact a complex allegory about how man's alterations of nature (through works) are related to good and bad government. Although Virgil does not mention the Golden Age by name in the ''Georgics'', he does refer in them to a time of primitive communism before the reign of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], when:
&lt;poem&gt;
''Fields knew no taming hand of husbandmen
''To mark the plain or mete with boundary-line.
''Even this was impious; for the common stock
''They gathered, and the earth of her own will
''All things more freely, no man bidding, bore.''&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
''ante Iouem nulli subigebant arua coloni
''ne signare quidem aut partiri limite campum
''fas erat; in medium quaerebant, ipsaque tellus
''omnia liberius nullo poscente ferebat.'' ([http://www.theoi.com/Text/VirgilGeorgics1.html#1 ''Georgics'', Book 1: 125–28])&lt;/poem&gt;

This view, which identifies a [[State of Nature]] with the celestial harmony of which man's nature is (or should be, if properly regulated) a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], reflects the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic cosmology]] that prevailed among literate classes of Virgil's era. It is seen again in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (7 CE), in which the lost Golden Age is depicted as a place and time when, because nature and reason were harmoniously aligned, men were naturally good:
&lt;poem&gt;
''The Golden Age was first; when Man, yet new,
''No rule but uncorrupted Reason knew:
''And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
''Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear.''
''His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
''Needless was written law, where none opprest:
''The law of Man was written in his breast.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/metamorphoses-book-the-first/ Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'', Book the First, eighteenth century version, "Translated into English verse under the direction of Sir Samuel Garth by [[John Dryden]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[William Congreve]], and other eminent hands.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The Graeco-Roman concept of the "natural man" delineated by Ovid and many other classical writers, was especially popular during the [[Deism|Deistically]] inclined 18th century. It is often erroneously attributed to [[Rousseau]], who did not share it.&lt;ref&gt;See A. O. Lovejoy's essay on "The Supposed Primitivism of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality" in ''Essays in the History of Ideas'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1948, 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Soft" and "hard" primitivism in Arcadia==
In his famous essay, "[[Et in Arcadia ego]]: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition",&lt;ref&gt;"Et in Arcadia ego: Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition," in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955) pp. 297–98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erwin Panofsky]] remarks how in ancient times, "that particular not overly opulent, region of central Greece, Arcady, came to be universally accepted as an ideal realm of perfect bliss and beauty, a dream incarnate of ineffable happiness, surrounded nevertheless with a halo of 'sweetly sad' melancholy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt; conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Arcady, as we encounter it in all modern literature, and as we refer to it in our daily speech, falls under the heading of “soft" or golden-age primitivism. To be sure, this real Arcady was the domain of Pan, who could be heard playing the [[Syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]] on Mount [[Maenalus]]; and its inhabitants were famous for their musical accomplishments as well as for their ancient lineage, rugged virtue, and rustic hospitality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other Golden Ages==
There are analogous concepts in the religious and philosophical traditions of the South Asian subcontinent. For example, the [[Vedas|Vedic]] or ancient [[Hindu]] culture saw history as cyclical, composed of [[yuga]]s with alternating Dark and Golden Ages. The Kali yuga (Iron Age), Dwapara yuga (Bronze Age), Treta yuga (Silver Age) and Satya yuga (Golden Age) correspond to the four Greek ages. Similar beliefs occur in the ancient [[Middle East]] and throughout the ancient world, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Heinberg (1989). ''Memories and Visions of Paradise: Exploring the Universal Myth of a Lost Golden Age'' Los Angeles, Calif.: Tarcher. 282 pp. MISBN 0-87477-515-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu===
The Indian teachings differentiate the four world ages ([[Yugas]]) not according to metals, but according to quality with Truth being the defining feature of the Golden Age. After the world fall at the end of the fourth, worst age (the Kali yuga) named after the Messianic figure Kali, the cycle should be continued, eventually culminating in a new golden age.

The [[Krita Yuga]] also known as the Satya yuga, the First and Perfect Age, as described in the [[Mahabharata]], a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Epic poetry|epic]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Men neither bought nor sold; there were no poor and no rich; there was no need to labour, because all that men required was obtained by the power of will; the chief virtue was the abandonment of all worldly desires. The ''Krita Yuga'' was without disease; there was no lessening with the years; there was no hatred or vanity, or evil thought whatsoever; no sorrow, no fear. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Satya Yuga lasts for 1,728,000 years, Treta Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvapara Yuga 864,000 years and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. According to the Puranas there are 71 such cycles in a life of Manu whose life duration is 306.72 million years. The reign of fourteen Manus (4.32 billion years) comprises one day (Kalpa) of Brahma.&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana&lt;/ref&gt;
Knowledge, meditation, and communion with Spirit hold special importance in this era. The average life expectancy of a human being in Satya Yuga is believed to be about 100,000 years. That duration of life declines in next age, Treta Yuga to 10,000 years, followed by Dvapara Yuga 1 000 years and Kali Yuga up to 100 years. During Satya Yuga, most people engage only in good, sublime deeds and mankind lives in harmony with the earth. [[Ashrams]] become devoid of wickedness and deceit. [[Natya]]m (such as [[Bharatanatyam]]), according to [[Natya Shastra]], did not exist in the Satya Yuga "because it was the time when all people were happy".

===Brahma Kumaris===
The [[Brahma Kumaris]] and [[AIVV|Prajapita Brahma Kumaris]] make reference to five yuga in a single cycle of 5,000 years in which the Golden Age, or Satya yuga, is the first and lasts for 1,250 years. Three of the remaining four; Thretha Yuga (Silver Age), Dwarpar Yuga (Copper Age) and Kali Yuga (Iron Age), also last for 1,250 years each. The fifth age, Sangum Yuga (Confluence Age), is given to the last 100 years of the fourth age and represents the period when the Iron Age is destroyed and the next Golden Age is created.&lt;ref name="4ages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |title=The ages of the time cycle according to the Brahma Kumaris |archivedate=15 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215144916/http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajayoga-meditation/cycle-of-time.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;The World Drama is the story of the rise and fall of human souls during their sojourn in this world. It is about the interplay of souls, matter and God, and of the different stages through which human souls pass in five different epochs or acts of this drama.The drama begins with the Golden Age, when every soul expresses its original qualities of purity, peace, love and truth, and human relationships are marked by complete harmony. The virtuous nature of these divine beings is mirrored by nature, which is in its pristine state and serves humans with abundance. This is the time remembered as heaven or paradise by humanity.

Golden age is the time when the human beings are full of all the divine virtues and have all the seven qualities peace, purity, love, wisdom, happiness, power and bliss to the fullest. And henceforth they are called deities, that we remember them as were our ancestors and whose divinity is worshiped in Hindu temples. The silver age comes after golden age where as time goes by, the souls, who are the actors in this drama, undergo a gradual decline. By Act Two, the number of souls has increased significantly, and though all are still happy and prosperous, the radiance and fullness that characterized their lives is no more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/the-world-drama/|title=The World Drama - Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|work=Brahma Kumaris® Int'l HQ {{!}} Godly University For Free RajYoga Meditation|access-date=2018-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajayoga Mediation taught at the Brahma Kumaris are the way to revive the seven qualities within and awaken self true divinity, the souls of Satyuga AKA Golden Age has.

Meditation energizes your awareness, bringing both peace and wisdom to a busy mind. It expands one’s capacity to love, and heals broken hearts. It also dissolves many fears, replacing them with lightness and freedom from anxiety.

But perhaps the greatest gift that meditation brings is the glow of inner peace that is both gentle and strong.

Practice of Rajyoga meditation or intellectual communion with God brings into the soul many powers. Of these, eight are important.[http://www.brahmakumaris.com/rajyoga-meditation/benefits-of-meditation/ The Eight Powers.]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Norse===
The [[Old Norse]] word ''gullaldr'' (literally "Golden Age") was used in [[Völuspá]] to describe the period after [[Ragnarök]], where the surviving gods and their progeny build the city [[Gimlé]] on the ruins of [[Asgard]]. In this period, [[Baldr]] reigns.

===Bible===
There is a reference to a succession of kingdoms in [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]]'s dream in [[Daniel 2]], in decreasing order identified as gold, silver, bronze, iron and finally mixed iron and clay.

{{quote|31 "Your Majesty looked, and there before you stood a large statue – an enormous, dazzling statue, awesome in appearance. 32 The head of the statue was made of pure gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, 33 its legs of iron, its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 34 While you were watching, a rock was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver and the gold were all broken to pieces and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel+2%3A+31-35&amp;version=NIV|title=Daniel 2: 31-35|publisher=Zondervon|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Daniel 2: 31-35}}

The interpretation of the dream follows in verses 36–45.

===Fantasy===
In modern [[fantasy world]]s, whose background and setting sometimes draw heavily on real-world myths, similar or compatible concepts of a Golden Age exist in the said world's prehistory; when deities or [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games|elf]]-like creatures existed, before the coming of [[human]]s.

For example, in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a Golden Age exists in [[Middle-earth]] legendarium. [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (the part of the world where ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is set), was designed to be symmetrical and perfect. After the wars of the Gods, Arda lost its perfect shape (known as [[Arda Unmarred]]) and was called [[Arda Marred]]. Another kind of 'Golden Age' follows later, after the Elves awoke; the [[Eldar (Middle-earth)|Eldar]] stay on [[Valinor]], live with the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Valar]] and advance in arts and knowledge, until the rebellion and the fall of the [[Noldor]], reminiscent of the Fall of Man. Eventually, after the [[Dagor Dagorath|end of the world]], the [[Silmaril]]li will be recovered and the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] rekindled. Arda will be remade again as [[Arda Healed]].

In ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' universe, the "Age of Legends" is the name given to the previous Age: In this society, channelers were common and [[Aes Sedai]] – trained channelers – were extremely powerful, able to make [[Concepts in the Wheel of Time series#Items of Power|''angreal'', ''sa'angreal'', and ''ter'angreal'']], and holding important civic positions. The Age of Legends is seen as a utopian society without war or crime, and devoted to culture and learning. Aes Sedai were frequently devoted to academic endeavours, one of which inadvertently resulted in a hole – The Bore – being drilled in the Dark One's prison. The immediate effects were not realised, but the Dark One gradually asserted power over humanity, swaying many to become his followers. This resulted in the War of Power and eventually the Breaking of the World.

Another example is in the background of the ''[[Lands of Lore]]'' classic computer game, where the history of the Lands is divided in Ages. One of them is also called the Golden Age, a time when the Lands were ruled by the 'Ancients', and there were no wars. This age ended with the 'War of the Heretics'.

The Golden Age may also refer to a state of early childhood. Herbert Spencer argued that young children progress through the cognitive stages of evolution of the human species and of human civilization, thereby linking pre-civilization and infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education|last=Spencer|first=Herbert|publisher=|year=1861|isbn=|location=|pages=5.|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Grahame]] called his evocation of early childhood {{'}}''The Golden Age''{{'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Golden Age|last=Grahame|first=Kenneth|publisher=The Bodley Head|year=1985|isbn=|location=UK|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.

===Present-day usage===
{{See also|Golden age (metaphor)}}
The term "Golden Age" is at present frequently used in the context of various fields, such as the "[[Spanish Golden Age]]", "[[Dutch Golden Age]]", "[[Golden age of alpinism]]", "[[Golden Age of American animation]]", "[[Golden Age of Comics]]", "[[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]", "[[Golden Age of Television]]", "[[Golden Age of Hollywood]]", "[[Golden age of arcade video games]]", "[[Golden Age of Radio]]", "[[Golden age hip hop|Golden Age of Hip Hop]]" and even "[[Golden Age of Piracy]]" or "[[Golden Age of Porn]]". Usually, the term "Golden Age" is bestowed retroactively, when the period in question has ended and is compared with what followed in the specific field discussed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12563">'''Historians of England in the Middle Ages''' helped to lay the groundwork for modern historical [[historiography]], providing vital accounts of the early history of [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Normandy]], its cultures, and revelations about the historians themselves.&lt;ref&gt;The term "English" in the context of this article also includes Welsh and Norman authors who wrote about history relevant to England.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most remarkable period of historical writing was during the [[High Middle Ages]] in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when English [[chronicle]]s produced works with a variety of interest, wealth of information and amplitude of range. However one might choose to view the reliability or nature of particular works, it is from these that much of our knowledge of the Middle Ages originates.

==Early Middle Ages==
Prior to the boom in historical writing in the High Middle Ages, the number and quality of works from England's earlier period is often lacking, with some notable and bright exceptions. Later historians lamented the gaps in this period and usually explained it by way of Viking invasions; in the twelfth century [[William of Malmesbury]] said: "in many places in England that knowledge of the deeds of the saints has been wiped out, in my opinion by the violence of enemies".&lt;ref&gt;[[William of Malmesbury]], ''[[Gesta pontificum Anglorum]]'', ed. N.E.S.A. Hamilton (RS;1870)&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed chronologically, by author's death. Dates represent the historical period covered by the work(s). Works and authors listed are not exhaustive. Here are the major and most significant historians and chroniclers of the period:&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Gransden, ''Historical Writing in England: c. 500 to c. 1307'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Gildas]], ''On the Ruin of Britain'' (''De Excidio Britanniae'') (died 570)
#[[Bede]], ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'' (''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'') AD 1-731
#''History of Britain'' (''[[Historia Brittonum]]'') 809 (attributed to [[Nennius]], perhaps falsely)
#[[Asser]], ''Life of King Alfred'' 893
#''[[Annales Cambriae]], Annals of Wales'' 447-954 (c.970)
#[[Æthelweard (historian)|Æthelweard]], ''Chronicle'' (''[[Chronicon Æthelweardi]]'') AD 1-975

==High Middle Ages==
The [[High Middle Ages]] were a golden period for historical writing in England. The craft of history was not a professional subject taught in school, such as the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] subjects of logic, theology, law and natural science, but rather something practised by well-educated men of learning, not subjected to the process of systems and procedures of [[Medieval university|Academia]]. It was a realm for educated men in monasteries and the courts of kings, bishops and barons, who had the time and position and particular talents to pursue it. As a result, the quality and variety of the histories from this period are highly variable, with some entertaining and appealing examples.

[[List of English chronicles|Numerous chroniclers]] prepared detailed accounts of recent history.&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Briggs, "History, Story, and Community: Representing the Past," in ed. Sarah Foot and Chase F. Robinson, eds., ''The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 2: 400-1400'' (2012) 2: 391.&lt;/ref&gt;  King Alfred the Great commissioned the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 893, and similar chronicles were prepared throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Swanton, ''The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous production is by a transplanted Frenchman, [[Jean Froissart]] (1333-1410).  His ''[[Froissart's Chronicles]]'', written in French,  remains an important source for the first half of the Hundred Years' War.&lt;ref&gt;John Jolliffe, ''Froissart's Chronicles'' (Faber &amp; Faber, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066 there was an explosion of interest in English history. It has been theorized this was due in part to the native English desire to reclaim their cultural identity from the debacle of 1066. As well the new Norman rulers were interested in discovering who it was they had reigned over, which fuelled demand for legends of England's early Kings, such as Geoffrey’s [[King Arthur]].

===Characteristics===
The works of this period are often categorized by [[chronicle]]s, and by literary histories. Chroniclers recorded events and dates of events with little prose or expansion. For example, the ''Winchcombe Annals'', by a twelfth-century monk, wrote one paragraph for each year, no matter how much or little happened, with one sentence for each event in that year. In this way chronicles would often give as much, or more, attention to things of little importance as those things of greater importance.

Unlike chronicles, the literary histories could be classified along with other forms of medieval literature. Indeed, entertainment was considered a legitimate function of historical writing. Historical accounts of battles often included long, and entirely invented, speeches from leaders. Histories were as much a part of medieval literature as other forms, such as the romance. Most of them endeavoured to be readable, arming themselves, as Roger of Wendover does, against both "the listless hearer and the fastidious reader" by "presenting something which each may relish", and so providing for the joint "profit and entertainment of all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/211/0901.html "Latin Chroniclers from the Eleventh to the Thirteenth Centuries: England and Normandy"] from ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'' (1907–1921).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another characteristic of the histories of the period is that they borrowed heavily from other writers, often directly copying entire works as their own.  For example, [[Henry of Huntingdon]]'s ''History of the English'' is only one quarter original, relying in many places on Bede's ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. This process would often be compounded as later writers would copy these works in full or part.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Partner,  "Henry of Huntingdon: Clerical Celibacy and the Writing of History." ''Church History'' 42#04 (1973): 467-475. [http://www.arts.cornell.edu/medieval/SeminarPDFs/Partner1973_ClericalCelibacyAndTheWritingOfHistory.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bede]] was highly regarded by historians of this period, and later historians lamented the fact that the 223-year period between Bede's death in 735 and [[Eadmer]]s ''History of Recent Events'' (starting in 960) was sparsely represented. William of Malmesbury said of Bede "after him you will not easily find men who turned their minds to the composition of Latin histories of their own people".&lt;ref&gt;William of Malmesbury, ''Gesta regum'', prologue.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry of Huntingdon referred to Bede as "that holy and venerable man, a man of brilliant mind,".&lt;ref&gt;Henry of Huntingdon, ''Historia Anglorum'', 4.11&lt;/ref&gt;

For writing contemporary history, historians could draw on their own eye-witness accounts, reports from those they met and primary source documents such as letters. A good network of contacts was essential, and taking many journeys was common. Clerics assigned to the courts of Kings would often have the best access to information, such as Roger of Howden in [[Henry I of England|Henry I]]'s reign. Although some monks, such as William of Newburgh, never left their monastery, yet he was able to obtain considerable information through the network of story-telling and gossip which existed in the theoretical seclusion and silence of monastic life.

====Geoffrey of Monmouth====
[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] is singled out from the list because, on the one hand, he was one of the most popular historians in England of this period. On the other hand, his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain'') was considered almost entirely fiction and was not considered authentic history by some other contemporary historians. ''Kings of Britain'' covers the legend of King Arthur as well as other Welsh legends of the early period of England, and was presented, and often accepted, as actual English history. It was extremely popular, but other contemporary historians, interested in impartiality and truth, were highly critical of Geoffrey. [[William of Newburgh]] devotes an extended section of the preface of ''Historia'' to discredit Geoffrey, saying at one point "only a person ignorant of ancient history would have any doubt about how shamelessly and impudently he lies in almost everything".&lt;ref&gt;William of Newburgh, ''History of English Affairs'', Book I, preface&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion over the [[historical basis for King Arthur]] continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;John Edward Lloyd, "Geoffrey of Monmouth," ''English Historical Review'' (1942) 57#228 pp. 460-468 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/554371 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of Stoczek 1831 1.png|thumb|315px|The [[Battle of Stoczek]]]]
'''Jan Bogumił Rosen''' (16 October 1854 in [[Warsaw]] – 8 November 1936 in Warsaw) was a Polish painter of Jewish ancestry, known primarily for his battle scenes. His son was the muralist and mosaicist, [[Jan Henryk de Rosen]].

== Biography ==
He was born to a wealthy Jewish family that had converted to [[Calvinism]]. Later, he  became  a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. As with many artists, he displayed an early talent for drawing and received his first lessons from [[Franciszek Kostrzewski]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/Rosen/Index.htm Biographical notes] @ Pinakoteka.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1872 to 1875, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], then took private lessons at the school of battle painter [[Józef Brandt]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; His next four years were spent at the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Isidore Pils]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/nowe/artists/rosen-jan-polska-agra-art-aukcje-obrazy-antyki.html Biographical notes] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived successively in Munich, Paris and [[Lausanne]] then, having a wife and newborn son to support, he settled in Russia in 1891, where he became a [[court painter]] to [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]; after the Tsar purchased his painting of [[Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich]] reviewing the Polish cavalry.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; In 1907 he made a trip to North Africa, followed by a visit to Scandinavia in 1908. He did not return to Poland until 1921, after the [[Polish-Soviet War]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

He is best known for battle scenes, especially from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], but also did  several works on the [[November Uprising]] prior to and after his residency in Russia.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Horses were among his favorite motifs and he was known for the attention he paid to precise details in his uniforms and weapons. Some critics, however, thought his paintings were only good for teaching history.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

The '''Kupferstich-Kabinett''' (English: '''Collection of Prints, Drawings and Photographs''') is part of the [[Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden|Staatliche Kunstsammlungen]] (State Art Collections) of [[Dresden]], [[Germany]].  Since 2004 it has been located in [[Dresden Castle]].&lt;ref name=dus&gt;[http://www.dresden-und-sachsen.de/dresden/ks_kupferstichkabinett.htm Kupferstich-Kabinett] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720084737/http://www.dresden-und-sachsen.de/dresden/ks_kupferstichkabinett.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} Information and history from the Dresden and Saxony tourist website. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Like many of Dresden's notable collections, this [[print room]] traces its origins to the [[Electorate of Saxony|Prince-electors of Saxony]]. The art chamber of the [[House of Wettin]], established around 1560, became an independent museum of prints and drawings in 1720.&lt;ref name=dus /&gt;&lt;ref name=melzer&gt;[http://www.riha-journal.org/articles/2010/melzer-vorgeschichte-dresdner-kupferstich-kabinett Zur Vorgeschichte des Dresdner Kupferstich-Kabinetts zwischen 1560 und 1738] Christian Melzer, ''Journal of the International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art'', '''0004'''. 21 June 2010. Retrieved 8 September 2010. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection was expanded in the following centuries.  It now describes itself as the oldest museum of graphic arts in the German-speaking world.  

Because most items had been evacuated to [[Schloss Weesenstein]] in the early stages of [[World War II]], the collection was saved from the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945.&lt;ref name=skd&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skd.museum/en/museums-institutions/residenzschloss/kupferstich-kabinett/history-of-the-collection/|title= History of the Collection|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Staatliche Kunstsammlung Dresden|access-date= 6 September 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; War-time losses were still high; around 50,000 items are still missing.&lt;ref name=skd/&gt; Most of the exhibits were [[Looted_art#Looting_by_the_Soviet_Union|looted]] by the [[Soviet Union]] after the war and did not return to Dresden until the late 1950s,&lt;ref name=dus /&gt; and some  when they were put back on display in the [[Albertinum]].

==Collection==
[[File:Jan van Eyck - Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Study for Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]'', attributed to [[Jan van Eyck]], c. 1431]]
The collection includes over 500,000 items, only a fraction of which can be exhibited.  The most renowned artists in the collection include [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Rubens]].  There is also a large number of works by artists with strong connections to Dresden, such as [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Ludwig Richter]], [[Georg Baselitz]] and [[Johannes Heisig]].  The collection of [[Käthe Kollwitz]] was started in 1898 and now numbers over 200 works from her oeuvre of drawings and graphics.&lt;ref name=dus /&gt;

Besides the permanent exhibition, the Kupferstichkabinett also hosts regular special exhibitions featuring both its own works and those on loan from other notable museums.

&lt;!--Please DO NOT add any Marian, Josephian or Jesus images on this list without properly confirming or seeing a copy of the Papal Bull authorizing their coronation either through social media, the chancery or diocese or at the Papal archives in Rome. The list is continuously being monitored and any attempt to add or remove an entry is scrutinized for authenticity and veracity of the existence of a Papal document from Rome. Just because a Bishop or priest crowns an image DOES  NOT MERIT  that a Pope has expressively authorized such a Pontifical act in a canonical manner. Just because a Pope blesses a crown or places a crown on the image out of piety does not make it canonical or institutional, for many instances has a Pontiff placed a crown out of piety but has not issued a papal document for its canonical effect in the Church.   --&gt;

[[File:Coronación Canónica de María Santísima de la Victoria 5 de mayo de 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Spaniard]] bishop José Vilaplana Blasco, as proxy in the name of [[Pope Benedict XVI]] crowning the image of Santa Maria Victoria in [[Spain]].]] 
[[File:Santissima Bula de la Virgen de Triana.jpg|thumb|The canonical document of [[Papal bull]] for Our Lady of Hope of Triana, legally granting the Marian image the Pontifical right to wear a crown in 1984 by [[Pope John Paul II]]. ]]
 
The following list enumerates the various [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]], [[Saint Joseph|Josephian]], and [[Christological]] images venerated in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], by which a [[Pope]] has officially issued a [[Papal bull]] of '''[[canonical coronation]]''' either by the [[Pontiff]], a [[Papal legate]] or a [[Papal nuncio]].
 
[[File:Papal bull for the Canonical Coronation of Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga from Pope Pius 12th.jpg|thumb|The Papal decree issued by [[Pope Pius XII]] for the [[canonical coronation]] of [[Virgen de los Remedios de Pampanga]] in 1956.]]

The very first Marian image crowned without a direct papal approval was by Cardinal [[Francesco Sforza Pallavicino]] with ''La Madonna della Oropa'' on 30&amp;nbsp;August 1620. The first Marian image Pontifically crowned was the painted image of ''La Madonna della Febbre'' (Madonna of Fever) on 27 May 1631 by [[Pope Urban VIII]] through the Vatican Chapter located at the Sacristy of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]].

The solemn prescription of ritual to crowning images is embedded in ''[[Ordo Coronandi Imaginem Beatae Mariae Virginis]]'' published by the [[Holy Office]] on 25 May 1981. Prior to 1989, papal bulls concerning the authorization of canonical coronations were handwritten on [[parchment]]. After 1989, the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] began issuing the specific recognition to crown a religious image, spelling out its approved devotional title and authorizing Papal legate. Several venerated  images of the [[Child Jesus]] and [[Saint Joseph]] have also been granted a Pontifical coronation.

|Notre Dame de Bon Secours ||15 August 1880 || Lablachere, [[Ardeche]]&lt;ref&gt;Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. — Dioecesis Vivariensis intra fines in
paroecia de Lablachere conspicuum exstat sanctuarium sub titulo Beatae
Mariae Virginis a Bono Succursu, quod christifideles, non modo a finitimis
locis sed a longinquis etiam regionibus peregrinorum more ad ipsum
confluentes, pie devoteque celebrant. Loco quidem antiquioris et parva®
ecclesiae, quam saeculo decimo septimo vertente, iam quidam pii coniuges
sub eodem titulo fundaverant, hodiernum templum saeculo decimo nono
tantum erectum est; ipsumque, tribus navibus constans, amplitudine molis
atque ornatu, picturis parietum, artisque operibus quibus ditatur, plane
dignum omnium laudibus videtur; adeo ut inter regionis Vivariensis sanctuaria
principem nunc locum facile teneat. Illud autem sanctuarium cuiusvis
ordinis condicionisque christifideles frequentes visitant Beatae Mariae
Virginis de Bono Succursu simulacrum veneraturi, quod ab annis fere
ducentis et quinquaginta inibi servatur et colitur, quodque prodigiis gratiisque
clarum aureo diademate anno MDCCCLXXX Apostolica auctoritate coronatum
est. Eodem in templo divinus cultus nitide peragitur a frugiferae

Nous vous déléguons, Vénérable Frère, pour couronner en Notre nom et avec Notre plein et entier consentement, la Statue représentant le bienheureux Patriarche Joseph et l'Enfant-Jésus, qui se trouve dans l'Église ou Sanctuaire de l'Archiconfrérie… Et afin que cette solennité profite au bien des âmes des fidèles, … nous accordons dans le Seigneur à tous et à chacun des fidèles, qui, après s'être confessés et avoir reçu la sainte communion, auront visité l'Église ou Sanctuaire de l’Archiconfrérie et offert à Dieu, devant la Statue de saint Joseph, de ferventes prières pour la concorde entre les princes chrétiens, l'extirpation des hérésies et l'exaltation de notre Mère la sainte Église, l'Indulgence plénière et rémission de tous leurs péchés, avec la faculté de l'appliquer aux âmes des fidèles qui ont quitté cette vie, unis à Dieu dans la charité soit le jour meme du Couronnement, soit l'un des sept jours suivants, au choix de chacun d'eux. Nonobstant toutes clauses contraires, Les presentes ne devant avoir de valeur que pour cette seule fois.

This article is a '''list of the [[palette (computing)|color palette]]s''' for notable [[computer graphics]], [[Computer terminal|terminals]] and [[video game console]] hardware.

Only a sample and the palette's name are given here. More specific articles are linked from the name of each palette, for the test charts, samples, simulated images, and further technical details (including references).

In the past, manufacturers have developed many different display systems in a competitive, non-collaborative basis (with a few exceptions, as the [[VESA]] consortium), creating many proprietary, non-standard different instances of display [[computer hardware|hardware]]. Often, as with early [[personal computer|personal]] and [[home computer]]s, a given machine employed its unique display subsystem, with its also unique color palette. Also, [[Computer software|software]] developers had made use of the color abilities of distinct display systems in many different ways. The result is that there is no single common standard nomenclature or classification taxonomy which can encompass every computer color palette.

In order to organize the material, color palettes have been grouped following arbitrary but rational criteria. First, generic monochrome and full [[RGB]] repertories common to various computer display systems. Second, usual color repertories used for display systems that employ [[indexed color]] techniques. And finally, specific manufacturers' color palettes implemented in many representative early [[personal computer]]s and [[video game console|videogame console]]s of various brands.

The list for personal computer palettes is split into two categories: [[8-bit]] and [[16-bit]] machines. This is not intended as a true strict categorization of such machines, because mixed architectures also exist (16-bit [[Central processing unit|processor]]s with an 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] or 32-bit processors with a 16-bit data bus, among others). The distinction is based more on broad 8-bit and 16-bit computer ''ages'' or ''generations'' (around 1975&amp;ndash;1985 and 1985&amp;ndash;1995, respectively) and their associated [[state of the art]] in color display capabilities.

Here is the common color test chart and sample image used to render every palette in this series of articles:

==List of monochrome and RGB palettes==

{{main|List of monochrome and RGB palettes}}

For the purpose of this article, the term ''monochrome palette'' means a set of intensities for a monochrome display, and the term ''RGB palette'' is defined as the complete set of combinations a given [[RGB]] display can offer by mixing all the possible intensities of the red, green, and blue primaries available in its hardware.

These are generic complete repertories of colors to produce black and white and RGB color pictures by the display hardware, not necessarily the total number of such colors that can be simultaneously displayed in a given text or graphic mode of any machine. RGB is the most common method to produce colors for displays; so these complete RGB color repertories have every possible combination of R-G-B triplets within any given maximum number of levels per component.

For specific hardware and different methods to produce colors than [[RGB]], see the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of computer hardware palettes]] and the [[List of palettes#List of computer hardware palettes|List of videogame consoles]] sections.

For various software arrangements and sorts of colors, including other possible full RGB arrangements within 8-bit [[color depth|depth]] displays, see the [[List of palettes#List of software palettes|List of software palettes]] section.

===Regular RGB palettes===

:These full RGB palettes employ the same number of [[bit]]s to store the relative intensity for the red, green and blue components of every image's [[pixel]] color. Thus, they have the same number of levels per channel and the total number of possible colors is always the cube of a power of two. It should be understood ''that 'when developed' ''many of these formats were directly related to the size of some host computers 'natural word length' in bytes&amp;mdash;the amount of memory in bits held by a single memory address such that the CPU can grab or put it in one operation.

===Non-regular RGB palettes===

:These are also RGB palettes, in the sense defined above (except for the 4-bit RGBI, which has an intensity bit that affects all channels at once), but either they do not have the same number of levels for each primary channel, or the numbers are not powers of two, so are not represented as separate bit fields.  All of these have been used in popular [[personal computer]]s.

==List of software palettes==

{{main|List of software palettes}}

Systems that use a 4-bit or 8-bit pixel [[Color depth|depth]] can display up to 16 or 256 colors simultaneously. Many [[personal computer]]s in the later 1980s and early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by [[software]] (either by the user or by a program) from their wider hardware's color palette.

Usual selections of colors in limited subsets (generally 16 or 256) of the full palette includes some RGB level arrangements commonly used with the 8 bpp palettes as ''master palettes'' or ''universal palettes'' (i.e., palettes for multipurpose uses).

These are some representative software palettes, but any selection can be made in such types of systems.

===System specific palettes===

:These are selections of colors officially employed as system palettes in some popular [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s that feature 8-bit displays.

==List of computer hardware palettes==

In early [[personal computer]]s and [[Computer terminal|terminals]] that offered color displays, some color palettes were chosen algorithmically to provide the most diverse set of colors for a given palette size, and others were chosen to assure the availability of certain colors.  In many early home computers, especially when the palette choices were determined at the hardware level by [[resistor]] combinations, the palette was determined by the manufacturer.

Many early models output [[composite video]] [[YPbPr]] colors. When seen on TV devices, the perception of the colors may not correspond with the value levels for the YPbPr values employed (most noticeable with NTSC TV color system).

For current RGB display systems for [[Personal computer|PC]]'s ([[Super VGA]], etc.), see the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#16-bit RGB|16-bit RGB]] and [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes#24-bit RGB|24-bit RGB]] for [[HighColor]] (''thousands'') and [[TrueColor]] (''millions of colors'') modes.

For [[video game console]]s, see the [[List of color palettes#Video game console palettes|List of videogame consoles]] section.

For every model, their main different graphical color modes are listed based exclusively in the way they handle colors on screen, not all their different screen modes.

The list is ordered roughly historically by video hardware, not grouped by branch. They are listed according to the original model of every system, which implies that enhanced versions, clones and compatibles also support the original palette.

'''''Love with the Proper Stranger''''' is a 1963 American [[romantic comedy]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] made by [[Alan Pakula|Pakula]]-[[Robert Mulligan|Mulligan]] Productions and Boardwalk Productions and released by [[Paramount Pictures]].  It was directed by [[Robert Mulligan]] and produced by [[Alan J. Pakula]] from a screenplay by [[Arnold Schulman]].

The film stars [[Natalie Wood]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Edie Adams]], [[Herschel Bernardi]] and [[Harvey Lembeck]]. The film also marked the screen debut of [[Tom Bosley]] and features a brief, uncredited appearance by the director's younger brother [[Richard Mulligan]], who later became a well-known television actor.

The film's title song, written by [[Elmer Bernstein]] and [[Johnny Mercer]], was recorded by [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]].

==Plot==
The film tells the story of Angie Rossini ([[Natalie Wood]]), a salesclerk at [[Macy's]] department store who finds herself pregnant after a one-night stand with musician Rocky Papasano ([[Steve McQueen]]). When she tracks him down, he doesn't remember her. She does not expect him to marry her; all she wants is the name of a doctor for an [[abortion]]. Meanwhile, Angie is being pressured by her older brothers, played by [[Herschel Bernardi]] and [[Harvey Lembeck]], to marry the unappealing restaurateur Anthony ([[Tom Bosley]]).

Rocky and Angie scrape up enough money for the crude backroom abortion. But when he and Angie meet the abortionist, who turns out not to be a doctor, Rocky refuses to let her go through with the dangerous procedure. The maturity he shows in doing this brings them closer. After meeting her brothers, Rocky decides to "take his medicine" by marrying her. Angie is insulted and turns him down. Angie wants romance, with "bells and banjos".

As an act of independence, Angie moves out of her family home. She begins dating Anthony, who offers to marry her. By acting aloof, she attracts Rocky, whom she invites to dinner at her apartment. At dinner, he makes advances on her and is rejected. Angie says she does not want to make the same mistake again. They quarrel and she throws him out. The next day, Rocky waits for her outside Macy's, ringing bells and playing a banjo, and wins her heart.

'''''M12,''''' aka M12 STUDIO, is an American [[artist collective]] and non-profit organization based in [[Byers, Colorado]] that features an evolving group of artist practitioners, curators, and designers.  Together they create artworks, research projects, and education programs that explore rural cultures and landscapes.  Initially formed as the ''municipalWORKSHOP'' in 2002 in [[York, Alabama]] by Richard Saxton when he was an artist-in-residence at the [[Rural Studio]], an architecture studio run by [[Auburn University]], the group evolved into M12 in 2007 when it became incorporated as a non-profit organization.  The core members have created over 20 projects since founding; their work was featured in the 2014 publication "A Decade of Country Hits: Art on the Rural Frontier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handwerker|first1=Margo|title=A decade of country hits. Art on the rural frontier.|date=2014|publisher=JAP SAM Books|location=Heyningen|isbn=978-94-90322-40-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''municipalWORKSHOP (2002-2007)'''

The municipalWORKSHOP was created in 2002 by Richard Saxton based on an effort to bring a "rural renaissance" to the small town of York, Alabama.  This art laboratory aimed to work with municipalities and communities to develop more creative approaches to living in rural America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fluharty|first1=Matthew|title=Richard Saxton's Vernacular Landscapes|url=http://theruralsite.blogspot.com/2011/02/richard-saxtons-vernacular-landscapes.html?m=1|publisher=The Art Of The Rural|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's first project was called ''Utility Now!'', a series of pedal-powered street-sweepers and utility tricycles and bicycles for city crews to better maintain York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility NOW|url=http://www.ruralstudio.org/projects/utility-now|website=Rural Studio|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2002-2007, the municipalWORKSHOP created public art projects with local communities throughout the United States. Projects range from a Music Integrated Kiosk Environment (M.I.K.E.) produced for the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=M.I.K.E. (Music Integrated Kiosk Environment)|url=http://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/networks-and-councils/public-art-network/public-art-year-in-review-database/mike-music-integrated-kiosk-environment|website=PUBLIC ART NETWORK YEAR IN REVIEW DATABASE|publisher=Public Art Network|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the AutoTour Vehicle built for the Center for Land Use Interpretation in Wendover, Utah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RICHARD SAXTON’S VERNACULAR LANDSCAPES|url=http://artoftherural.org/richard-saxtons-vernacular-landscapes/|website=Art of the Rural|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the collective formalized as M12, and expanded its reach to communities in Europe, South America, and Australia.
 
'''2007-present'''

M12 has exhibited at the 13th International Venice Architecture Biennale, The Kalmar Konstmuseum in Sweden, The Chicago Cultural Center, [[Franklin Street Works]], Wormfarm Institute, The 2011 Australian Biennial (SPACED), The 2010 Biennial of the Americas, The Center for Land Use Interpretation, The Ewing Gallery of Art and Architecture at the University of Tennessee, The John Michael Kohler Arts Center, The Contemporary Museum in Baltimore, Wall House #2 in the Netherlands, and The Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projects|url=http://m12studio.org|website=M12|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group now develops projects worldwide and operates out of a renovated feed store in Byers, Colorado and maintains a 40-acre site in Last Chance, Colorado.

==Projects==
* ''Campito'', which re-imagined the sheepherders wagon, initially commissioned by the Biennial of the Americas and subsequently featured in the Spontaneous Interventions exhibition in the U.S. Pavilion of the 13th International [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]].
* ''Prairie Modules'', an ongoing series of architectural sculptures that were first installed on the Indianapolis Cultural Trail. Subsequent modules are situated at the Wormfarm Institute in Reedsburg, Wisconsin and The Experiemental Site in Last Chance, Colorado.
*  ''Ornitarium'', a bird observatory and social space constructed in Denmark, Australia, created as part of the International Art Space Kellerberrin Australia 2011 site-based Biennial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5742">'''Mainly Mozart''' is a [[501(c)3]] non-profit based in [[San Diego]], [[California]].
Mainly Mozart was created in 1988&lt;ref name="in1988"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2012/oct/16/Mainly-Mozart-Atherton/ |title=Mainly Mozart founding conductor David Atherton resigns |last=Chute |first=James |date=October 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]] |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207104444/http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2012/oct/16/Mainly-Mozart-Atherton/ |archivedate=February 7, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Maestro]] [[David Atherton]] and Executive Director Nancy Laturno Bojanic, formerly of the [[San Diego Symphony]], to give the people of [[Southern California]] and [[Baja California]] an opportunity to experience classical music performed live in the summer by principal orchestral musicians. 

The focus was placed on [[Mozart]] because he is considered one of the world's greatest composers, and because of the breadth of masterful works that he composed specifically for [[chamber orchestra]]. Since its inception, Mainly Mozart has added the works of other composers with an emphasis on those of the 18th and 19th centuries.  Using the common language of music, Mainly Mozart has served as a regional resource by connecting communities in Southern California and [[Baja California]] to Mainly Mozart musicians, classical music, and stories behind the music.

==Presentations==
===Concerts===
The first Mainly Mozart Festival in June 1989 – a series of nine concerts—was performed on the outdoor stage of the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]]. Over the ensuing years, Mainly Mozart has increased its overall annual concert performances staged at various venues.  In June 2008, and just in time for the 20th anniversary of the Mainly Mozart Festival, Mainly Mozart will become the primary tenant of the restored 83-year-old, 1,300-seat [[Balboa Theatre]] in downtown San Diego. A $26-million renovation of the “jewel box” theatre has maintained its blend of [[Mediterranean]], [[Moorish]] and [[Spanish Revival]] architectural styles. Since 1992, the [[Balboa Theatre]] has been on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. San Diego’s Centre City Development Corporation funded the restoration.

===Spotlight Series===
In 1996, Mainly Mozart began producing the Spotlight Series featuring chamber music concerts during the winter and spring. The principal home of the series is The [[Scripps Research Institute]] in [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla]], but facilities in the north [[San Diego County]] coastal community of [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], and the inland community of [[Rancho Santa Fe, California|Rancho Santa Fe]] are also used.

===Bi-national and educational outreach===
In 1992 the Mainly Mozart Orchestra was invited to participate in the first Festival Internacional de Mozart in [[Baja California]] (now Mozart Binacional). This was also the year that Mainly Mozart established an educational component to bring music to students in low income or at risk neighborhoods in both San Diego County and Baja California. These programs are continually expanding and now reach over 60,000 students in both countries.

The lives and music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] are brought to school children through the Living Composers Series. These informative and entertaining half-hour assemblies engage students in interactive mini-plays set to the music of these master composers. Question and answer session rounds out the teaching session, and in-school materials are provided for both the pre- and post- performance educational activities.

Mainly Mozart also has been working to enrich the lives of economically disadvantaged families in [[Southeast San Diego]] through a partnership with the Jackie Robinson Family [[YMCA]]. Mainly Mozart's free ticket program has allowed hundreds of children to enjoy their very first concert experience at [[Copley Symphony Hall]] (home of the [[San Diego Symphony]]). In another outreach program, Mainly Mozart offers high school and college music students discounted concert tickets.

== Other endeavors ==
===The Amadeus Suite===
Mainly Mozart commissioned “The Amadeus Suite” in 1999. It was created by British jazz trumpeter [[Guy Barker]], who based his composition on characters from Mozart operas. In 2006, the suite was expanded by Barker and was performed in San Diego during the Mainly Mozart-led year-long San Diego County-wide celebration of Mozart's 250th birthday (January 27, 1756). The celebration was coordinated with cultural officials in [[Austria]].

=== Club Amadeus ===
To show its appreciation of its patron/donors, Mainly Mozart has presented a smaller, more intimate concert series known as Club Amadeus.  The supporters hear chamber music in elegant private residences and other special venues throughout San Diego.
Other annual funding for Mainly Mozart is provided, in part, by the [[City of San Diego Commission for Arts and Culture]]; the County of San Diego Community Enhancement program; the [[California Arts Council]]; the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]; and contributions from local businesses and foundations.

'''Mary Ann Esposito''' (born August 3, 1942 in [[Buffalo, New York]]) is an American [[chef]], cookbook writer, and the television host of ''Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito'', which started in 1989 and is the longest-running television cooking program in America.&lt;ref name="Copps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; Esposito has published over a dozen [[cookbook]]s.&lt;ref name="Copps"&gt;{{cite web | author= Copps, Annie  | year=2008 | title=Dinner with Guy and Mary Ann Esposito | work =[[Yankee (magazine)|Yankee]] | url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/blogs/foodblog/maryannesposito | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
She was raised in [[Buffalo, New York]].&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; Her mother was a [[dietician]].&lt;ref name="PIC"/&gt;

Her grandmothers, both professional chefs,&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated).  [https://www.pbs.org/food/chefs/mary-ann-esposito "Mary Ann Esposito"]. [[PBS]]. Retrieved September 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; moved to the United States from Italy in the 1890s. Her paternal grandmother, from [[Sicily]], owned a [[butcher shop]] in [[Fairport, New York]], and her maternal grandmother lived in Buffalo, where she owned a [[boarding house]]. The latter grandmother was from [[Naples]], and continued the traditions of her Italian household within the boarding house. The boarding house was the only house in the neighborhood that had a [[bathtub]], and on Friday nights she would offer neighbors a bath and dinner for a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]. While her grandmothers provided traditional Italian food, Esposito desired to eat standard foods like other children: [[Wonder Bread]] and [[iceberg lettuce]].&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt;

Esposito, who never intended to pursue a career in cooking, learned to cook from her family. Her grandmothers made bread every day, with Esposito helping to make upwards of twenty loaves of bread a day, [[canning]] vegetables and fruits, and helping to prepare ingredients for meals. Eventually, Esposito attended college, where she would graduate with a teaching degree and become an [[elementary school]] teacher.

In 1979, her mother sent her a [[pasta]] maker, and despite a lack of interest in cooking as an adult, Esposito taught herself how to make pasta [[dough]]. The following year, she and her husband Guy&lt;ref name="Copps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; visited Italy for the first time, visiting his cousins. While in Italy, Esposito started attending a [[cooking class]].

She began learning the history of Italian cooking, region by region, and traveling to the country twice a year for cooking lessons. At the [[University of New Hampshire]] she took classes to learn how to speak [[Italian language|Italian]]. By 1985, she had joined the history master's program at the university, writing her [[thesis]] about [[Italian Renaissance]] cooking.&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt;

==Career==
Esposito started teaching cooking through the [[University of New Hampshire]]'s Division of [[Continuing Education]]. In the mid-1980s, she submitted a proposal for a cooking show to [[New Hampshire Public Television]]. The show was delayed production because of the small size of the television station; however, upon moving to a larger station, a [[television pilot|pilot]] was taped. The pilot was a test to not only gauge viewer reception, but, to also see how Esposito would be on camera. On the hottest day of the year in the region, the television crew came to Esposito's home in [[Durham, New Hampshire]], and the pilot was taped. Upon airing, the pilot received great reception and the longest-running television cooking show was born.&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt;

Esposito has published over a dozen cooking books about Italian cooking and entertaining. Her 1997 book, ''What You Knead'', about [[breadmaking]], was awarded best in category by the [[International Cookbook Revue]] and was named one of ''[[Food &amp; Wine]]'' magazine's top cookbooks of 1997.&lt;ref name="Pavich"/&gt; She makes over forty public appearances a year nationally&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; and has appeared on the ''[[Today Show (NBC)|Today Show]]'', ''[[Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', [[QVC]], the [[Food Network]], [[Martha Stewart Living Radio]], and other programs.&lt;ref name="Pavich"/&gt; She contributed to ''[[The Huffington Post]]''&lt;ref name="HPBlog"&gt;{{cite web | author= Staff (undated)| title=Mary Ann Esposito – Creator &amp; Host, ''Ciao Italia''  | work =[[The Huffington Post]] | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mary-ann-esposito | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New Hampshire Home]]''.&lt;ref name="NHH"&gt;{{cite web | author=Esposity, Mary Ann | year=2010 | title=Home Cooking with Mary Ann Esposito | work=[[New Hampshire Home]] | url=http://www.nhhomemagazine.com/home/945184-421/home-cooking-with-mary-ann-esposito-homemade.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130208134023/http://www.nhhomemagazine.com/home/945184-421/home-cooking-with-mary-ann-esposito-homemade.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 8, 2013 | access-date=February 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito''===
''Ciao Italia with Mary Ann Esposito,'' is a thirty-minute [[cooking show]] produced for [[PBS]] by Esposito's own Mary Esposito Productions, and taped at New Hampshire Public Television. The show features Esposito's recipes and cooking tips, and visits from guest chefs. She also explores the history of Italian cooking and food.&lt;ref name="Paine"/&gt; Through the show, Esposito seeks to help her viewers learn about new recipes that are "doable, authentic, and good."&lt;ref name="PIC"&gt;{{cite web | author= Marie| date = January 10, 2010 | title=An Interview with Mary Ann Esposito of Ciao Italia | publisher=Proud Italian Cook | url= http://www.prouditaliancook.com/2010/01/interview-with-mary-ann-esposito-of.html | access-date= September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When deciding what to feature on the show, Esposito has four standards: she must like to eat the food, the ingredients should be easy to find, the recipe should be something unique and new to the viewer, and should be manageable by the kitchen staff. Every episode has twenty volunteers who work on the show. An entire season of shows, generally about thirty-two episodes, can be taped within two weeks during the summer, with two to three shows being taped a day.

All of the food is made from scratch in the studio, with each dish being prepared in numerous batches and at different recipe stages. This allows Esposito to execute an entire recipe in a matter of minutes that might take hours to complete. All of the recipes are planned by Esposito and the kitchen staff. Volunteers gather all the pertinent ingredients from local markets and go to [[Boston]] for specialty foods if unavailable locally.

Recipes are prepared the day of the show. ''Ciao Italia'' is not scripted. The studio set is loosely based on Esposito's home kitchen. The view out the window of the set is painted to appear as the view of the [[Oyster River (New Hampshire)|Oyster River]], which is seen from her home kitchen. To prepare for shows, Esposito researches and tests recipes outside the studio.&lt;ref name="Paine"&gt;{{cite web | author= Paine, Margaret Anne (undated) | year= | title=A Taste of Italy | work=[[University of New Hampshire Magazine]] | url=http://unhmagazine.unh.edu/sp00/maryannsp00.html | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognitions==
A scholarship foundation named after and maintained by Esposito awards scholarships for students seeking [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] to study [[culinary arts]].&lt;ref name="JWU"&gt;{{cite web | author= Press release (undated) | title=JWU Announces Winner of First Mary Ann Esposito Foundation Scholarship Lila Cornelio of Chicago Will Receive $10,000 in Financial Aid for Her Final Two Years of Culinary Studies | publisher=[[Johnson &amp; Wales University]] | url=http://www.jwu.edu/content.aspx?id=37558 | access-date= September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito was awarded an [[honorary degree]] from [[St. Anselm College]].&lt;ref name="Pavich"&gt;{{cite web | author= Stupakoff, Loraine | date = August 2010 | title=Exclusive Interview: Celebrity Chef Mary Ann Esposito – Host of 'Ciao Italia' | publisher= ItaliaLiving.com | url=http://www.italialiving.com/articles/food-wine/an-interview-with-celebrity-chef-mary-ann-esposito/ | access-date= February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has received the Lifetime Achievement Award in the Culinary and Cultural Arts of Italy by the [[Order Sons of Italy in America]]. She is in the Hall of Fame for the [[Italian Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name="Pavich"/&gt;

On June 2, 2013, a knighthood was bestowed upon her by the [[President of the Italian Republic]] under the title ''Cavaliere dell'Ordine della Stella d'Italia'' ([[Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity#Order of the Star of Italy (2011-present)|Knight of the Order of the Star of Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;Staff (undated).

A '''miscellany''' is a collection of various pieces of writing by different authors. Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a [[wikt:miscellany|miscellany]] can include pieces on many subjects and in a variety of different [[Literary genre|forms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/119276?rskey=nK2Wqw&amp;result=1 Miscellany, n.] ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to [[Anthology|anthologies]], whose aim is to give a ''selective'' and ''[[Western canon|canonical]]'' view of literature, miscellanies were produced for the entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise ''collectiveness'' and ''popularity''. Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:
{{quote|This last distinction is quite often visible in the basic categorical differences between anthologies on the one hand, and all other types of collections on the other, for it is in the one that we read poems of excellence, the "best of English poetry," and it is in the other that we read poems of interest. Out of the differences between a principle of selection (the anthology) and a principle of collection (miscellanies and beauties), then, comes a difference in aesthetic value, which is precisely what is at issue in the debates over the "proper" material for inclusion into the canon.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Mandell and Rita Raley, [http://oldsite.english.ucsb.edu/faculty/rraley/research/anthologies/#miscellanies ''Anthologies and Miscellanies''] (1997; last revised 2002). Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Manuscript miscellanies are important in the [[Middle Ages]], and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry.  Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, medical and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany.  They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience.  In the [[early modern period]] miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works.  Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the [[18th century in literature|18th century]], when [[#Development in the 18th century|over 1000]] English poetry miscellanies were published,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/about/ "About"], Digital Miscellanies Index&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[#Succession of the anthology|rise of anthologies]] in the early 19th century.  The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published [[magazine]], and many early magazines used the word in their titles.

== Manuscript and printed miscellanies before the 18th century ==
[[File:Ararat Ms. 11639 521a.jpg|thumb|Miniature of [[Noah's Ark]] landing on the [[Mountains of Ararat]] (fol. 521a), from the 13th century [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]]]]

The broadest distinction is between [[manuscript]] and [[printing|printed]] miscellanies. Manuscript miscellanies were carefully compiled by hand, but also circulated, consumed, and sometimes added to in this organic state – they were a prominent feature of 16th and early 17th century literary culture. Printed miscellanies, which evolved in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were compiled by editors and published by booksellers in order to make a profit. While manuscript miscellanies were produced by a small coterie of writers, and so were constructed around their own personal tastes, printed miscellanies were increasingly aimed towards a popular audience, and bear the marks of commercially driven, money making, opportunistic endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Beadle, Colin Burrow (eds.), ''Manuscript Miscellanies, c. 1450-1700'' (London: British Library, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smyth, ''‘‘Profit and Delight’’: Printed Miscellanies in England, 1640–1682'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Multi-authored collections are known to exist in many forms – such as [[newspapers]], [[magazines]], or [[Literary magazine|journals]] – and the act of [[commonplace book|commonplacing]], of transcribing useful extracts and quotations from multiple sources is also well recorded. However, the formal production of ''literary'' miscellanies came into its established form in the 16th and 17th centuries, and reached a highpoint in the 18th century. Although literary miscellanies would often contain critical essays and extracts of prose or drama, their main focus was popular [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], often including [[songs]]. At this time poetry was still a dominant literary form, for both low and high literature, and its variety and accessibility further suited it to miscellaneous publication.&lt;ref&gt;J. Paul Hunter, ‘Political, satirical, didactic and lyric poetry: from the Restoration to the death of Pope’ in John Richetti (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of English Literature, 1660-1780'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 160-208, pp. 160-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval miscellanies===
[[File:Trevelyon leaf.jpg|thumb|right|A patterned page from the Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608]]
Most medieval miscellanies include some religious texts, and many consist of nothing else. A few examples are given here to illustrate the range of material typically found. The [[Theological miscellany (British Library, MS Additional 43460)]] was made in late 8th century Italy with 202 folios of [[patristic]] writings in Latin. The 9th-century Irish [[Book of Armagh]] is also mostly in Latin but includes some of the earliest surviving [[Old Irish]] writing, as well as several texts on [[Saint Patrick]], significant sections of the [[New Testament]], and a 4th-century saint's [[Sulpicius Severus#Life of St. Martin, dialogues, and letters|''Life'']]. The [[Nowell Codex]] (BL Cotton Vitellius A. xv, ignoring a later volume bound in with it) is an [[Old English]] manuscript of about 1000 to 1010. It is famous for the only text of ''[[Beowulf]]'' but also includes a life of [[Saint Christopher]], ''[[Wonders of the East]]'' (a description of various far-off lands and their fantastic inhabitants), a translation of a ''Letter of Alexander to Aristotle'', and the poem ''[[Judith (poem)|Judith]]'' based on the [[Old Testament]] ''[[Book of Judith]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Cotton_MS_vitellius_a_xv British Library] page on the Nowell Codex.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of [[Anglo-Saxon literature#Extant manuscripts|the four Old English Poetic Codices]] from which the bulk of surviving [[Old English poetry]] comes, all of which can be classed as miscellanies.

The ''[[Lacnunga]]'' is a 10th or 11th century miscellany in Old English, Latin and Old Irish, with health-related texts taking a wide range of approaches, from [[herbal medicine]] and other medical procedures, to prayers and charms.  The lavishly illuminated late 13th century [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]] contains mostly biblical and liturgical texts, but also legal material, over 200 poems, and calendars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=19212&amp;CollID=27&amp;NStart=11639 British Library catalogue online], North French Miscellany&lt;/ref&gt;  The large 9th-century Chinese text ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'', contains various Chinese and foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short anecdotes, and tales of the wondrous and mundane, as well as notes on such topics as medicinal herbs and tattoos. The ''[[Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608]]'', an oversized illustrated manuscript of 594 pages, depicts a wide range of subjects including herbal cures, biblical stories, a list of the mayors of London, proverbs, calendars, and embroidery patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibited at the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], in [http://folgerpedia.folger.edu/Word_%26_Image:_The_Trevelyon_Miscellany_of_1608/ 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verse miscellanies ===

Verse miscellanies are collections of poems or poetic extracts that vary in authorship, genre, and subject matter. The earlier tradition of manuscript verse continued to be produced in the 16th century and onwards, and many of these early examples are preserved in national, state, and university libraries, as well as in private collections. The [[Devonshire MS|Devonshire Manuscript]] is a verse miscellany that was produced in the 1530s and early 1540s, and contains a range of works, from original pieces and fragments to translations and medieval verse. Compiled by three eminent women, it is one of the first examples of men and women collaborating on a literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Southall, Raymond. “The Devonshire Manuscript Collection of Early Tudor Poetry, 1532–41,” ''Review of English Studies'', n.s. 15 (1964): 142-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also prominent is the Arundel Harington manuscript, containing the writings of [[Thomas Wyatt (poet)|Sir Thomas Wyatt]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], and [[Philip Sidney|Sir Philip Sidney]]. Into the 17th century, the two Dalhousie Manuscripts are also of literary significance, as they contain the largest sustained contemporary collection of [[John Donne]]’s verse.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Eckhardt, "Verse Miscellanies, Manuscript" in Garrett A. Sullivan (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature'', 3 vols. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2012), III, 1002-1006, pp. 1002-1003.&lt;/ref&gt; Although fewer [[medieval literature|medieval]] verse miscellanies have been preserved, the Auchinleck Manuscript survives as a good example: it was produced in London in the 1330s and offers a rare snapshot of pre-[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucerian]] [[Middle English literature|Middle English]] poetry.&lt;ref&gt;David Burnley and Alison Wiggins (eds.),[http://auchinleck.nls.uk/index.html ''The Auchinleck Manuscript''], National Library of Scotland (5 July 2003).

Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most surviving manuscript verse miscellanies are from the 17th century:

{{quote|[A]s far as ‘literary’ manuscripts are concerned, there are more surviving manuscripts from the seventeenth century than from the sixteenth: of the approximately 230 pre-1640 surviving manuscript collections of poetry that were not single-author collections only 27 belong to the sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Love and Arthur F.

Printed verse miscellanies arose in the latter half of the 16th century, during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603). One of the most influential [[English Renaissance]] verse miscellanies was [[Richard Tottel]]’s ''Songes and Sonettes'', now better known as ''[[Tottel's Miscellany]]''. First printed in 1557, it ran into nine further editions before 1587; it was not then printed again until the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Zarnowiecki, "Verse Miscellanies, Printed" in Garrett A. Sullivan (ed.) ''The Encyclopedia of English Renaissance Literature'', 3 vols. (Oxford: Blackwell, 2012), III, 1006-1010, pp. 1006-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Although few new miscellanies emerged during the insurrectionary years of [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1603–1649), there was a resurgence of interest during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] period and 18th century, and the vast majority of printed verse miscellanies originate from this latter period.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smyth, [http://purl.oclc.org/emls/08-1/smyth.htm "An Online Index of Poetry in Printed Miscellanies, 1640-1682."] ''Early Modern Literary Studies'' 8.1 (May, 2002) 5.1-9. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poetry in these miscellanies varied widely in [[List of literary genres|genre]], form, and subject, and would frequently include: love [[Lyric poetry|lyrics]], [[pastoral]]s, [[ode]]s, [[ballad]]s, [[song]]s, [[sonnet]]s, [[satire]]s, [[hymn]]s, [[fable]]s, [[panegyric]]s, [[parodies]], [[epistle]]s, [[elegies]], [[epitaph]]s, and [[epigram]]s, as well as translations into English and [[prologue]]s and [[epilogue]]s from plays. The practice of [[Attribution (copyright)|attributing]] poems in miscellanies was equally varied: sometimes editors would carefully identify authors, but most often the miscellaneous form would allow them to disregard conventions of [[author]]ship. Often authors were indicated by a set of initials, a partial name, or by reference to a previous poem "by the same hand"; equally often there were [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] or [[pseudonym]]ous attributions, as well as misattributions to other authors – or even made-up or deceased persons. Within a miscellany, editors and booksellers would often exercise considerable freedom in reproducing, altering, and extracting texts. Due to early [[Copyright law of the United Kingdom|copyright]] laws, lesser-known authors would regularly play no part in the printing process, receive no remuneration or [[royalties]], and their works could be freely redistributed (and sometimes even [[#Print trade and piracy|pirated]]) once in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;Manushag N. Powell, ''Performing Authorship in Eighteenth-Century English Periodicals'' (Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press, 2012), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development in the 18th century ==
[[File:Bog House.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Frontispiece and title page to eighteenth-century miscellany|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] and [[title page]] to ''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20535 ''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany'']&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed to include "the Lucubrations of the Polite Part of the World, written upon walls, in Bog-Houses" such as the one at left of the tavern shown.]]

Throughout the 18th century, the miscellany was the customary mode through which popular verse and [[occasional poetry]] would be printed, circulated, and consumed. Michael F. Suarez, one of the leading authorities on miscellanies, states:

{{quote|The importance of printed miscellanies is evidenced by the fact that there are some 1,136 surviving verse miscellanies and anthologies (including reprints and separate issues, but excluding songbooks) for the seventy-five years from 1700 to 1774 – more than fifteen per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Suarez, ‘Publishing contemporary English literature, 1695–1774’ in Michael F. Suarez, Michael L. Turner (eds.) ''The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), Volume 5: 1695-1830, 649-666, p. 658.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Including songbooks, the ''New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature'' lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies which were printed between 1701 and 1800.&lt;ref&gt;George Watson (ed.), ''The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature'', 5 vols. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971), II, cols. 341-429.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sheer number and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century, there are few generalizations that can be made about them. From the polite ([[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]]’s ''The Tea-Table Miscellany'', 1724–27)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V7UDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=why+so+pale+and+wan+fond+lover&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hi9oUa_eAZCa0QWZ3oCQCg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzhQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''The Tea-Table Miscellany''&lt;/ref&gt; to the partly obscene (''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany'', 1731–33)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20535 Gutenburg] ''The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany''&lt;/ref&gt; the central purpose behind nearly all printed verse miscellanies was the reader’s entertainment. However, they were also marketed with practical purposes in mind: as educative moral guides (''Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse'', 1787),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qp8vAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=1787+Miscellanies,+moral+and+instructive,+in+prose+and+verse%3B+collected+from+various+authors+for+the+use+of+schools&amp;pg=PR1&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse''&lt;/ref&gt; as repositories of useful information (''A Miscellany of Ingenious Thoughts and Reflections in Verse and Prose'', 1721–30), as elocutionary aids ([[William Enfield]]’s ''The Speaker'', 1774-1820),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dI9HAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=The+speaker;+or+Miscellaneous+pieces:+selected+from+the+best+English+writers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=utFmUYLMIe2b0wXouIDYCA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw Google Books] ''The Speaker''&lt;/ref&gt; and as guides for poetical composition (Edward Bysshe's ''The Art of English Poetry'', 1702–62).&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/featured/?id=09 Digital Miscellanies Index], ''The Art of English Poetry''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NewberyBaseball.jpg|thumb|left|Some miscellanies were even aimed at children, as ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'' (1744) demonstrates. It consists of rhymes and morals for each letter of the alphabet.]]

=== Range of titles and audiences ===

In a competitive market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves with a wide range of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (''The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy'', 1796), the medicinal (''The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen'', 1730), the festive or feast (''A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies'', 1746), the curious (''A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies'', 1751–82),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/featured/?id=07 Digital Miscellanies Index], ''A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies''&lt;/ref&gt; and the curatorial (''The Foundling Hospital for Wit'', 1743–64).&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/featured/?id=03 Digital Miscellanies Index], ''The Foundling Hospital for Wit''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Variety and popularity ===

Despite these categorizations, miscellanies attempted to appeal to a wide audience by containing a variety of material for different tastes. Although an editor might orient the miscellany towards an intended audience, by nature of the variety of verse a much wider readership would have been possible. One-off, occasional miscellanies might prove popular and warrant further volumes or editions, such as political pamphlets (''Poems on Affairs of State'', 1689-1705),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SYJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Poems+on+Affairs+of+State&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-9VmUcqkGMqp0QWCrICQBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Poems%20on%20Affairs%20of%20State&amp;f=false Google Books] ''Poems on Affairs of State''&lt;/ref&gt; resort-based works (''Tunbrigalia: or the Tunbridge Miscellany'', 1712–40), local productions (''[[Ritson's Yorkshire Garland 1809|The Yorkshire Garland]]'', 1788),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7VEJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Yorkshire+Garland+1788&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n9ZmUbGjBpGT0QXLj4DgAw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''The Yorkshire Garland''&lt;/ref&gt; and courtly, coterie or collegiate collections ([[Thomas Warton]]’s ''The [[Oxford sausage#History|Oxford Sausage]]: or select poetical pieces written by the most celebrated wits of the University of Oxford'', 1764-80).&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eecNAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Sausage:+or+select+poetical+pieces+written+by+the+most+celebrated+wits+of+the+University+of+Oxford&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JtdmUZjKDYKn0AWroIHACw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Oxford%20Sausage%3A%20or%20select%20poetical%20pieces%20written%20by%20the%20most%20celebrated%20wits%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Oxford&amp;f=false Google Books] ''The Oxford Sausage''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print trade and piracy ===

Often the commercial success of a miscellany would stimulate the publication of similarly titled, parasitic, and even entirely [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] works. Dublin booksellers, outside the jurisdiction of the [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) which had established copyright in England, could legally reproduce any popular miscellany that they thought would make a profit. [[Robert Dodsley]]’s hugely popular ''Collection of Poems by Several Hands'' (1748)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P9gIAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Collection+of+Poems+by+Several+Hands&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rddmUdTzNujw0gXVoYCoDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw Google Books] ''Collection of Poems by Several Hands''&lt;/ref&gt; was copied entirely by Dublin booksellers in 1751, though it also underwent other, more minor piracies in the English literary market – such as unauthorized continuations, supplements, or companion texts attempting to exploit the reputation of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Suarez, ‘The Production and Consumption of the Eighteenth-Century Poetic Miscellany’ in Isabel Rivers (ed.) ''Books and Their Readers in Eighteenth-century England: New Essays'' (London: Leicester University Press, 2001), 217-251, pp. 227-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The decline of verse miscellanies ==
[[File:A Tale of Two Cities, Chapter 1, in All The Year Round.png|thumb|left|alt=Opening chapter of A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens|The famous opening lines of [[A Tale of Two Cities]] in the periodical [[All the Year Round]].]]

=== Changing tastes and technology ===

Although poetry maintained cultural pre-eminence for most of the 18th century, it was at the same time retreating before the advance of prose, and particularly the [[Novel#The rise of the novel|rise of the novel]], as the new dominant form of literary expression in the West.&lt;ref&gt;David Perkins, ''A History of Modern Poetry from the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode'' (London: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1976), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of poetry as the most widely printed format is also partly [[Printing press#Industrial printing presses|technological]]. Lee Erickson argues:

{{quote|Once the materials and means of printing became cheaper, diffuse prose was no longer at a comparative economic disadvantage with compressed poetry. The periodical format, in particular, gave rise to a variety of shorter prose forms that competed for and largely won over the audience for poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Erickson, ''The Economy of Literary Form: English Literature and the Industrialization of Publishing, 1800-1850'' (London: Johns Hopkins Press, 1996), ‘The Poets’ Corner: The Impact of Technological Changes in Printing on English Poetry’, 19-48, pp. 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miscellanies however remained popular throughout the 19th century, especially what came to be known as the “weekly news miscellany, which typically appeared at the weekend and featured not only a summary of the week’s intelligence but also a variety of instructive and entertaining matter”, in other words what we call today a [[magazine]], but poetry was no longer privileged among these publications.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Law and Robert L. Patten, ‘The Serial Revolution’ in David McKitterick (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of the Book'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), Volume 6: 1830-1914, 144-171, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Verse miscellanies slowly died out in the [[Victorian era]], as literary miscellanies made possible the [[Serial (literature)|serial publication]] of novels, such as [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]’s ''[[Jack Sheppard (novel)|Jack Sheppard]]'' (1839-40) or [[Charles Dickens]]’ ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' (1859) which was published in 31 weekly instalments in his literary periodical ''[[All the Year Round]]''. There were few, if any, miscellanies devoted to poetry. Instead, verse would be the minority of content, in order to provide variety from the extensive prose:

{{quote|[S]erial fiction became an increasingly popular ingredient of these miscellanies, [but] the syndicators often began by supplying metropolitan advertising and intelligence, and soon also provided regular features such as poetry and critical essays, or columns aimed at women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Law and Patten, 'The Serial Revolution', p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Works of the English Poets, v. 18, title page.jpg|thumb|alt=title page of Chalmers' Works of the English Poets|[[Title page]] of [[Alexander Chalmers]]' ''Works of the English Poets'', volume 18.]]

=== Succession of the anthology ===
{{See also|Anthology}}

In the wake of collections such as [[Robert Anderson (editor and biographer)|Robert Anderson]]’s ''Works of the British Poets'' (thirteen vols., 1792-95) and [[Alexander Chalmers]]’ ''Works of the English Poets'' (twenty-one vols., 1810), anthologies were increasingly adopted for the publication of assorted poems. Barbara M. Benedict argues:

{{quote|As readers and publishers matured in the eighteenth century, however, another form appeared that challenged the dominance of the miscellany: the ‘anthology’, a comprehensive selection of the best fashionable verse.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Benedict, ‘Collecting and the Anthology in Early Modern Culture’ in Barbara Korte, Ralf Schneider, and Stefanie Lethbridge (eds.), ''Anthologies of British Poetry: Critical Perspectives from Literary and Cultural Studies'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2001), 43-55, pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Printing technologies and the rise of the novel played an important role in reshaping the nature of miscellanies, as did changing ideas about the [[British literature|native literary canon]]. Attempts to construct a credible canon of English verse had been ongoing since the early 18th century, and with its success the place of poetry was determined by the advent of authoritative anthologies which claimed to represent the very best of the English poetic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brody Kramnick, ''Making the English Canon: Print-Capitalism and the Cultural Past, 1700–1770'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance and recognition ==

In contrast to [[Anthology|anthologies]], whose aim is to give a canonical history of literature, miscellanies tend to reflect the dynamic literary culture of the time in which they were produced. As Michael F. Suarez states:

{{quote|Miscellanies are usually compilations of relatively recent texts designed to suit contemporary tastes; anthologies, in contrast, are generally selections of canonical texts which have a more established history and a greater claim to cultural importance. The miscellany, then, typically celebrates – and indeed constructs – taste, novelty and contemporaneity in assembling a synchronous body of material. It should be distinguished from the anthology, which honours – and perpetuates – the value of historicity and the perdurance of established canons of artistic discrimination in gathering texts recognized for their aesthetic legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, ‘Poetic Miscellany’, pp. 218–9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are modifications to this definition, such as the argument that miscellanies could contain elements that might be considered anthological (the inclusion of [[Culture of ancient Rome#Literature|classical]] literary pieces for example) or could be republished years later when their original contents had matured in literary value.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Batt, ‘Eighteenth-Century Verse Miscellanies’ in ''Literature Compass'' 9/6 (2012), 394-405, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez also notes that eighteenth-century miscellanies often contained “extracts from a variety of single-author publications” and, furthermore, that “many miscellanies appropriated select pieces from earlier poetry collections, thus forming what were essentially anthologies of miscellanies.”&lt;ref&gt;Suarez, ‘Poetic Miscellany’, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The literary marketplace ===

It is generally accepted{{clarify|date=May 2013}} that miscellanies offer insight into the popular taste of the moment, of what people read and how they read it; yet they also provide information about the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[Sociology of literature|social]] and [[Economics|economic]] concerns underlying the production and consumption of literature. Miscellanies were assembled, marketed and sold with a contemporary reading audience in mind, and reveal a dynamic between the taste which they played a part in shaping, and the preoccupations of the [[Editing|editors]] who complied and the [[Publishing#Publishing as a business|publishers]] who sold them. Indeed, the range of price and format reveals the extent to which poetry was packaged and sold for different readerships. As Jennifer Batt argues:

{{quote|The contents and omissions, the packaging and marketing, the publication history, and the reception history of every verse collection produced in the 18th century reveals how literary culture was conceived of by its creators and how those creators wished to intervene in the literary marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Batt, ‘Verse Miscellanies’, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Miscellanies frequently placed emphasis on variety, novelty and fashionability, providing their readers with a range of different pieces by various writers, but also keeping them abreast of the newest developments in the literary market. They are a prime demonstration of early [[marketing]] and [[advertising]] techniques in literature.

=== Contemporary importance and influence ===

Miscellanies were an influential literary form at the time. From the beginning of the 18th century, verse miscellanies were gathering together a selection of poetic works by different authors, past and present, and so played a part in the development of the concept of the [[British literature|English canon]]. These literary miscellanies might be sold as unique collections, arising from the combinations of writers in a small literary circle; or their function could attempt to be more national and historical, by representing the finest works of British poets to date.

Since so many collections included prose extracts alongside poetry, often from eighteenth-century novels such as Laurence Sterne’s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]]'' (1759), it is arguable they aided the popularisation of novels. [[Leah Price]]’s ''The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel'' (2000), in particular, discusses the relationship between miscellanies and prose fiction in the latter half of the 18th century.

Because of the variety and novelty they emphasise, as well as the [[anonymity]] of authorship they could offer, miscellanies often enabled the inclusion and so expression of more submerged voices, such as those of women, and more marginal forms of writing, such as the comic, the curious, and the crude. As Dustin Griffin has noted:

{{quote|For most other poets, women especially, publication in a miscellany was the only way in which their work might reach the public. Many other ephemeral satirical poems, circulating as broadsheets or in manuscript, were gathered in the successive editions of ''Poems on Affairs of State'' (1689–1705).&lt;ref&gt;Dustin Griffin, ‘The Social World of Authorship 1660-1714’ in John Richetti (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of English Literature'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 37-60, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many miscellanies contained exclusively the [[Women's writing in English|writing of women]], most famously ''Poems by Eminent Ladies'' (1755)&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bkkJAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Poems+by+Eminent+Ladies+(1755&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j9tmUYHwM8Ok0QWq0IDABA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Books] ''Poems by Eminent Ladies''&lt;/ref&gt; – a collection of verse by 18 women poets including [[Aphra Behn]], [[Elizabeth Carter]], [[Mary Leapor]], [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Katherine Philips]], [[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]], [[Mary Monck]], [[Lady Mary Chudleigh]], and [[Mary Barber (poet)|Mary Barber]] – and recently critics have brought to light the ways in which such women made a key contribution to the miscellany culture of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chantal Lavoie, ''Collecting Women: Poetry and Lives 1700–1780'' (Lewisburg, Pa.: Bucknell University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Ezell, ''Writing Women’s Literary History'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Perdita Project'' provides the fullest evidence of women’s role in manuscript miscellanies in the period 1500-1700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amdigital.co.uk/m-collections/collection/perdita-manuscripts-1500-1700/ Perdita Manuscripts], [http://web.warwick.ac.uk/english/perdita/html/ Index of Perdita Women]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:On a Lady's Muff.jpg|thumb|At the other extreme, a [[Sexual objectification|sexually objectifying]] poem from [https://archive.org/stream/fugitivemiscella02almo#page/168/mode/2up ''The Fugitive Miscellany''] playing [[Euphemism|euphemistically]] on a ladies' fashion accessory, the [[Muff (handwarmer)|"muff"]].]]

Miscellanies also presented themselves as performing an important cultural or curatorial role, by preserving [[Bookbinding|unbound]] sheets, [[Literary fragment|fragments]] and [[ephemera]] which otherwise would have been lost – and thus offering a unique insight into the vibrant literary life of the 18th century. A prime example of such curiosity-shop publications is ''The fugitive miscellany: a collection of fugitive pieces in prose and verse'' (1774),&lt;ref group="ebook"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/fugitivemiscella02almo Internet Archive] ''The fugitive miscellany. Being a collection of such fugitive pieces, in prose and verse, as are not in any other collection. With many pieces never before published.'' 2 vols. (London, 1774). [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] T118867&lt;/ref&gt; which includes nonsense rhymes, epitaphs, inscriptions, poems made out of newspaper cuttings, as well as wills written in verse. [[Literary criticism#The current state of literary criticism|Late twentieth-century criticism]] has drawn attention to the cultural and literary importance of these non-canonical, lesser-known and ephemeral kinds of popular verse – such as the recent discovery of a poem spuriously attributed to John Milton, “[[An Extempore upon a Faggot]]”.&lt;ref&gt;The Bodliean Library, [http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/bodley/news/2010_sept_23 'Archive of irreverent miscellanies put online']. 23 September 2010. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the most prolific source of anonymous or pseudonymous publication, miscellanies provide insight into the unconventional history of English literature. [[Roger Lonsdale]] notes in his influential anthology, ''The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse'' (1984): “One of the most interesting poets [from this period] is the ubiquitous ‘Anonymous’, whose voice almost never registers in conventional literary history”. Crucially, he suggests that we would know more about “the landscape of eighteenth-century poetry” if more attention was paid to “the innumerable miscellanies by several hands”.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Lonsdale (ed.) ''The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), pp. xxxix, xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary criticism and research projects ==

It is now widely accepted by literary critics that paying attention to forms of access to literature, and to the [[Reception theory|reception history]] of individual works and authors, is an important part of the history of literary culture. In this context, the miscellany has grown rapidly in interest in eighteenth-century studies. As Jennifer Batt states:

{{quote|The study of miscellanies has become vibrant in recent years, encouraged by controversies about canon formation as well as by the growth of interest in reception history, the history of reading and the history of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Batt, ‘Verse Miscellanies’, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In light of such developments there have arisen projects attempting to make the vast number and array of verse miscellanies more accessible to modern researchers and readers, most prominently through the process of online [[Digitizing#Literary preservation|digitization]]. In 2012 [http://versemiscellaniesonline.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/ ''Verse Miscellanies Online''] was launched, which offers a searchable critical edition of seven printed verse miscellanies published in the 16th and early 17th centuries. While some projects focus on creating online editions of the most significant verse miscellanies, others have attempted to arrange a corpus of miscellanies produced in set periods, such as [http://scriptorium.english.cam.ac.uk/ ''Scriptorium: Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts Online''] (2006-2009), a digital archive of manuscript miscellanies and commonplace books from c. 1450-1720. The largest undertaking by far has been [http://digitalmiscellaniesindex.org/ ''The Digital Miscellanies Index''], an ongoing project funded by the [[Leverhulme Trust]].  The ''Index'' seeks to create a freely available online database of the 1000-plus verse miscellanies published in the 18th century, based on a comprehensive bibliography compiled by Michael F. Suarez, and supplied by the world’s single largest collection of miscellanies held in The [[Bodleian Library]]’s Harding Collection.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Bodleian Library]], [http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/ragtime-to-riches 'Ragtime to riches, a musical legacy at the Bodleian Library']. 10 January 2010. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Begun in 2010, this project was successfully completed in September 2013.

==History==
[[File:Odissi danseus.jpg|right|180px|thumb|Classical Dancers at Nrityagram.]]
The word Nrityagram, literally translated, means "dance village,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/news/2008/mar/27/nrityagram-dance-ensemble/|title=Nrityagram Dance Ensemble|date=27 March 2008|work=Santa Barbara Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in founder, Protima Gauri's own words,

{{quote|"It is a community of dancers in a forsaken place amidst nature. A place where nothing exists, except dance. A place where you breathe, eat, sleep, dream, talk, imagine - [[dance]]. A place where all the [[Sense|five senses]] can be refined to perfection. A place where dancers drop negative qualities such as jealousy, small-mindedness, greed and malice to embrace their colleagues as sisters and support each other in their journey towards becoming dancers of merit."}}

[[File:Grounds and gardens of the Nrityagram Dance Community.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Grounds and gardens of the Nrityagram following [[vernacular architecture]].]]
Protima left Mumbai in 1989 to start the dance village, the land was given on lease by state government and by 1990 the institution had taken root, inaugurated on 11 May 1990, by the then Prime Minister, V.P. Singh.&lt;ref name=is&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&amp;page=article-details&amp;code_title=3233|title=Nrityagram and the Passion for Dance|last=Venkataraman|first=Leela|date=30 July 2010|publisher=''The Island''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being designed by the well- reputed Indian architect [[Gerard da Cunha]], the building started coming up soon after, following the [[Indian vernacular architecture|vernacular architecture]] of the region. The Nrityagram Dance Ensemble made its New York debut in 1996 and received rave reviews.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Lynne Fernandez a Delhi-based theatre actress and light designer, first came to Nrityagram in December 1995 to coordinate Surupa Sen's debut and the Nrityagram ensemble's trip abroad and after Protima suffered a mild heart attack, Lynn became actively involved managing the institution, as Protima gradually withdrew. Eventually Protima formally handed over Nrityagram to Lynne Fernandez on 10 July 1997, who became the Managing Trustee of the institution.&lt;ref name=ip&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970724/20551073.html|title=Falling in step|last=Kalghatgi|first=Manjiri|date=24 July 1997|work=Indian Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in August, Protima Gauri set off on her pilgrimage to [[Kailash Mansarovar]] and it was there that she died in the [[Malpa landslide]], near [[Pithoragarh]] on the night of 18 August 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EFDC1F3CF933A0575BC0A96E958260 Obituary] ''[[New York Times]]'', 30 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Nrityagram has grown in its stature by leaps and bounds and is known today for some of the best ensemble work in. Perfection in dance along with a high level of good technical support, leading to a complete presentation, is its trademark. Even today, gurus and students work in the fields within the Nrityagram, which has 10 acres of land, and grow their own food. Over the years, only Odissi gurukul has been functional due to paucity of funds.&lt;ref name="hit"/&gt;

Surupa Sen who first came as a student, debuted in 1995, later became artistic director of Nrityagram in 1997, and remains to date.&lt;ref name=ip/&gt;  Orissa Dance Academy (ODA) student Bijayini Satpathy who was first student of Nrityagram, is now in charge of the Odissi gurukul.&lt;ref name=te&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main47.asp?filename=hub161010HIP_right.asp|title=Getting the HIP right|volume=7 | issue=41 | date=16 October 2010|newspaper=[[Tehelka]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of Nrityagram's few but meritorious students include, Pavithra Reddy, who has had her solo debut in 2003 and who will be hopefully seen in some solo pieces on a wider platform very soon. She has spent almost 12 years as a residential student at Nrityagram, and has learnt under the tutelage of Surupa Sen and Bijayini Satpathy. Ayona Bhaduri and Priyambada Patnaik are also students at this gurukul. They both joined Nrityagram in 1998 and have been a part of the ensemble since 2001.
[[Vasanta Habba]], a cultural event organised by Nrityagram is known as the classical [[Woodstock]] of [[India]], first started in 1994 by Protima, held on first Saturday of February every year, and soon it became the famous annual night-long festival of arts that had 40,000 visitors when it was last held in 2004.&lt;ref name=ip/&gt; When the [[2004 tsunami]] struck, the subsequent 2005 event was cancelled, and community hasn't been able to regroup since,&lt;ref name="hit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/03/05/stories/2007030500920300.htm|title=Waiting for spring|date=5 Mar 2007|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it hopes to restart it in 2011.&lt;ref name=te/&gt;
A 30-minute documentary on the dance village, ''Nrityagram: For the Love of Dance,'' directed and produced by Nan Melville was premiered at the annual Dance on Camera Festival, in New York City on 25 January 2010 to which dance critic [[Alastair Macaulay]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' responded, .."much of the dance footage, not least during the closing credits, is spellbinding. I wanted the film to be twice as long." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/arts/dance/25documentary.html?_r=1|title=Dance: Freezing Motion in a Festival of Dance Films|last=Macaulay|first=Alastair|date=24 January 2010|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nrityagram Dance Ensemble==
The 1996 New York debut of the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble, with Surupa Sen, Bijayini Satpathy, Anitha Nair, Pavithra Reddy and Jaya Mukherjee was called, "one of the most luminous dance events of the year" by [[Jennifer Dunning]], the dance critic of the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Dance in Review|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|authorlink=Jennifer Dunning|date=22 June 1996|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its New York debut, the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble has performed to sold-out  shows in Hawai and Bozeman, USA, Middle East, Far East and Europe, and in time created a niche for itself in the world of dance.&lt;ref name=is/&gt; Today, apart from lead dancer-choreographers, Surupa Sen and Bijayini Satpathy, Pavitra Reddy, Rasmi Raj and Manasi Tripathy are the other permanent  dancers of the Ensemble, and are accompanied by musicians like Swain playing the percussion instrument, ''Mardala'', Srinibas Satapathy’s on [[Bamboo flute]] ([[Bansuri]]) and Sanjib Kumar Kunda on the violin.&lt;ref name=sw/&gt; Its first full-length production "Sri - In Search of  the Goddess", was premiered in Delhi in 2001 and in the United States in 2002-2003,  to critical acclaim. Since then it created several productions including, "Ansh", "Sacred Space" (2005),  and "Separation and the Duality of the human  spirit" (2008) &lt;ref name=is/&gt;

By 2008, the ensemble had made 12 tours of the US, its 2006 production, ''Vibhakta'' (The Division), by Surupa Sen which was performed together by Surupa Sen, the artistic director, and Bijayini Satpathy was listed in "The Ten Best Dance Performances of 2008" by dance critic [[Joan Acocella]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2008/12/joan-acocella-the-ten-best-dan.html#ixzz12GPEDGFW|title=Joan Acocella: The Ten Best Dance Performances of 2008|date=9 December 2008|work=The New Yorker}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prior to it in February 2008, the Ensemble had the world premiere  of "''Pratima'': Reflection", at [[New York City]], [[Joyce Theater]].&lt;ref name=sw&gt;[http://www.ballet.co.uk/magazines/yr_08/mar08/rs_rev_nrityagram_dance_ensemble_0208.htm Rachel Straus, (February 2008), Review: Nrityagram Dance Ensemble: ‘Pratima: Reflection’, ''Ballet.co.uk''], accessed 30 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It has also performed at [[Pittsburgh Dance Council]] (2002).

[[File:Nrityagram Dance Community.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Temple at Nrityagram entrance]]
A thoughtfully evolved temple (''pictured''), built in 1998, welcomes people to the Nrityagram, near [[Hesaraghatta Lake]], it depicts the image of [[Kelucharan Mohapatra]], guru of founder Protima Bedi in a dancing pose. The caption given for the picture states: &lt;blockquote&gt;
''Temple at Nrityagram. Fashioned from the raw mud of Nrityagram and fired after it was built, the temple is dedicated to space. It is decorated with panels depicting the elements, dance motifs, mudras and designs from costumes and ghungroos. Inside is a granite rock scooped out to hold water and a flame that stays lit.''

[[File:Nala Damayanti.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Nala]]-[[Damayanti]] theme, from the [[Mahabharat]] in Pahari style]]
'''Pahari painting''' (literally   meaning a painting from the mountainous regions: ''pahar'' means a mountain in [[Hindi]]) is an umbrella term used for a form of [[Indian painting]], done mostly in miniature forms, originating from Himalayan hill kingdoms of North India, during 17th-19th century, notably [[Basohli]], Mankot, [[Nurpur State|Nurpur]], [[Chamba State|Chamba]], [[Kangra State|Kangra]], [[Guler State|Guler]], [[Mandi State|Mandi]], and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/asia_features/sikhism/art/hindu/index.html Hindu Hill Kingdoms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330034200/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/asia_features/sikhism/art/hindu/index.html |date=30 March 2010 }} ''[[V&amp;A Museum]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/art/pahari.htm Pahari] ''Kamat''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nainsukh]] was a famous master of the mid-18th century, followed by his family workshop for another two generations.

==Origin and area==
[[File:Radha celebrating Holi, c1788.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Radha]] celebrating ''[[Holi]]'', ca 1788.]]
[[File:Sudama bows at the glimpse of Krishna's golden palace in Dwarka. ca 1775-1790 painting.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Sudama]] bows at the glimpse of Krishna's golden palace in [[Dwarka]]. ca 1775-1790 painting.]]

The Pahari school developed and flourished during 17th-19th centuries stretching from [[Jammu]] to [[Almora]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], in the sub-[[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[India]], through [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Each created stark variations within the genre, ranging from bold intense [[Basohli Painting]], originating from [[Basohli]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], to the delicate and lyrical [[Kangra paintings]], which became synonymous to the style before other schools of paintings developed.  The Kangra style reached its pinnacle with paintings of [[Works of Jayadeva#Pahari paintings|Radha and Krishna]], inspired by [[Jayadeva|Jayadev]]'s [[Gita Govinda]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8EGUpX1O0hoC&amp;pg=RA2-PA62&amp;dq=Kangra+painting&amp;as_brr=0 Pahari centres] ''Arts of India: Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Music, Dance and Handicraft'', by Krishna Chaitanya. Published by Abhinav Publications, 1987. {{ISBN|81-7017-209-8}}. ''Page 62''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pahari painting grew out of the [[Mughal painting]], though this was patronized mostly by the Rajput kings who ruled many parts of the region, and gave birth to a new idiom in Indian painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturopedia.com/Painting/pahari.html Pahari]&lt;/ref&gt;

Published 13 February 2014 by Doubleday Children's, the book includes a new story by Wilson, ''Leonie's Pet Cat'', as well as extracts from such classics as [[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]], by Dodie Smith, and [[Through the Looking Glass]] by Lewis Carroll.&lt;ref name=AmazonToc&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/reader/0857533525/ref=sib_dp_bod_toc?ie=UTF8&amp;p=S009#reader-link Paws and Whiskers preview: Table of Contents]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arrian, Periplus.jpg|thumb|Beginning of the Arrian Periplous Euxeinou Pontou of Johann Froben and Nicolaus Episcopius, Basel 1533]]
A '''periplus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛr|ɪ|p|l|ʌ|s}}) is a manuscript document that lists the ports and coastal landmarks, in order and with approximate intervening distances, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Source Book in Geography|first=George|last=Kish|page=21|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1978|isbn=0-674-82270-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6qF4vjZvhYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense the periplus was a type of log. It served the same purpose as the later Roman [[itinerarium]] of road stops; however, the Greek navigators added various notes, which if they were professional geographers (as many were) became part of their own additions to Greek geography.

The form of the ''periplus'' is at least as old as the earliest Greek historian, the Ionian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. The works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] contain passages that appear to have been based on ''peripli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=40|title=Josephus Geographicus: The Classical Context of Geography in Josephus|first=Yuval|last=Shahar|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2004|isbn=3-16-148256-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIJLJSYFogUC&amp;pg=PA40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Periplus'' is the Latinization of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word περίπλους (''periplous'', contracted from περίπλοος ''periploos''), is "a sailing-around." Both segments, ''peri-'' and ''-plous'', were independently [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]]: the ancient Greek speaker understood the word in its literal sense; however, it developed a few specialized meanings, one of which became a standard term in the ancient navigation of [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Known ''peripli''==
Several examples of ''peripli'' that are known to scholars:

=== Carthaginian ===

*The Periplus of [[Himilco the Navigator]], parts which are preserved in [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Avienus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Purcell (classicist)|Nicholas Purcell]] "Himilco" in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' 3rd. ed. [[Oxford]]; [[Oxford University Press]] 1999 p.707&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Hanno the Navigator#Periplus account|Periplus]] of [[Hanno the Navigator]], [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] colonist and explorer who explored the coast of [[Africa]] from present-day [[Morocco]] southward at least as far as [[Senegal]] in the sixth or fifth century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |translator-first=H. |translator-last=Schoff |title=The Periplus of Hanno a voyage of discovery down the west African coast |year=1912 |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6541953M/The_Periplus_of_Hanno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek ===

*The ''Periplus'' of the Greek [[Scylax of Caryanda]], in Caria, who allegedly sailed down the [[Indus River]] and then to [[Suez]] on the initiative of [[Darius I]]. This voyage is mentioned by [[Herodotus]], and his pleriplus is quoted by Hecataeus of Miletus, [[Aristotle]], [[Strabo]] and Avienus.&lt;ref&gt;"Scylax" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1374&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'', a description of trade routes along the coasts of [[Atlantic Europe]], by anonymous Greek navigators of Massalia (now Marseille, France), possibly dates to the sixth century BCE, also preserved in Avienus&lt;ref&gt;"Periploi" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1141&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pytheas of Massilia]], (fourth century BCE) ''On the Ocean'' (Περί του Ωκεανού), has not survived; only excerpts remain, quoted or paraphrased by later authors, including Strabo, [[Diodorus Siculus]], Pliny the Elder  and in Avienus' ''Ora maritima''.&lt;ref&gt;"Pytheas" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1285&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]'', generally is thought to date to the fourth or third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Scylax" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1374&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Pleriplus of [[Nearchus]] surveyed the area between the Indus and the Persian Gulf under orders from [[Alexander the Great]]. He was a source for Strabo and [[Arrian]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;"Periploi" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1141&lt;/ref&gt;
*''On the Red Sea'' by [[Agatharchides]]. Fragments preserved in Diodorus Siculus and [[Photius]].&lt;ref&gt;"Agatharchides" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.36&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Periplus of [[Scymnus]] of [[Chios]] is dated to around 110&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Scymnus" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.137436&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' or Red Sea was written by a Greek of the Hellenistic/Romanized [[Alexandria]]n in the first century CE. It provides a shoreline itinerary of the [[Red Sea|Red (Erythraean) Sea]], starting at the port of [[Berenice (port)|Berenice]]. Beyond the Red Sea, the manuscript describes the coast of India as far as the [[Ganges River]] and the east coast of Africa (called [[Azania]]). The unknown author of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' claims that Hippalus, a mariner, was knowledgeable about the "monsoon winds" that shorten the round-trip from India to the Red Sea.{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=34}} Also according to the manuscript, the Horn of Africa was called, "the Cape of Spices,"{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=36}} and modern day Yemen was known as the "Frankincense Country."{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=37}}
*The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini]]'', a description of trade routes along the coasts of the [[Black Sea]], written by [[Arrian]] (in Greek Αρριανός) in the early second century CE.

==''Rahnāmag''==
[[Persia]]n sailors had long had their own sailing guide books, called ''Rahnāmag'' in [[Middle Persian]] (''Rahnāmeh'' رهنامه in [[Modern Persian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dehkhoda |first=Ali Akbar |first2=Mohammad |last2=Moʻin |year=1958 |title=Loghat-namehʻi Dehkhoda |location=Tehran |publisher=Tehran University Press: Rahnāma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They listed the ports and coastal landmarks and distances along the shores.

The lost but much-cited sailing directions go back at least to the 12th century. Some described the [[Indian Ocean]] as "a hard sea to get out of" and warned of the "circumambient sea," with all return impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature |first=Felipe |last=Fernandez-Armesto |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-7432-0248-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJcSAQAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactic of naval combat==
A ''periplus'' was also an ancient naval manoeuvre in which attacking ''[[triremes]]'' would outflank or encircle the defenders to attack them in the rear.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">The '''Rambusch Decorating Company''' was founded in 1898 in [[New York, New York]] by '''Frode Rambusch''', a Danish immigrant.  

In the 1920s, Rambusch was the decorator for many elaborate movie palaces, including the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in [[New York City]], which seated 6,214 and opened in March 1927. That project was supervised by Harold Rambusch, working with architect [[Walter W. Ahlschlager]]. It also designed the interior of the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]], which was built in 1930 as a movie house but was later converted to a [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] theatre.&lt;ref name="Morrison"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=William |title=Broadway Theatres: History and Architecture|type=trade paperback |series=Dover Books on Architecture |year=1999|publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |location=[[Mineola, New York]]|isbn=0-486-40244-4 |pages=162–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm helped decorate the main public rooms at the [[Waldorf-Astoria hotel]] when it was built in the early 1930s. It also helped make some of the stained glass windows at St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue. The firm also employed later generations of Rambusches, including '''Viggo F. E. Rambusch'''.

During World War II, the firm helped camouflage American airfields from enemy planes. Sketches of orchards and farm buildings were painted on the airfields to confuse the enemy.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;New York Times, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E1DF1330F933A05751C1A960958260 Viggo F.

'''Raëd Abillama Architects''' is an [[architect]]ural firm based in [[Lebanon]]. Raëd Abillama founded the firm in 1997, after returning from the [[United States]] where he was educated.

Their projects are primarily located in [[Lebanon]].The architectural firm has been responsible for the construction of various homes and villas in [[Lebanon]], along with the winery for [[IXSIR wine]] and the headquarters for Mitsulift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raed Abillama Architects|url=http://architizer.com/firms/raed-abillama-architects/|publisher=Architizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was also selected for the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 1999 and again in 2001.

==History==
Raëd Abillama first founded the [[Architect]]ural firm Raëd Abillama Architects in 1997. He began working in architecture after graduating from [[Rhode Island School of Design]] in 1993. After gaining a master's degree in 1994 from [[Columbia University]] in [[Architectural Design]], he moved to [[Lebanon]] to establish an architectural firm.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|first1=Unknown|title=About the Firm|url=http://www.raarchitects.com|publisher=Raëd Abillama Architects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the foundation of Raëd Abillama Architects they began to offer services for building design, interior and industrial design.&lt;ref name=about /&gt; In 1999 Raëd Abillama Architects was selected for the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=creativeeconomy&gt;{{cite web|title=Raëd Abillama|url=http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/people/raëd-abillama/|publisher=Creative Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was selected again for the [[Aga Khan Award for Architecture|Aga Khan Award]] in 2001 &amp; 2007.&lt;ref name=creativeeconomy /&gt; In 2005, the company were finalists for the YCE Design Award.&lt;ref name=creativeeconomy /&gt; In 2010, the Mada Residential Development in [[Lebanon]]. A year later [[CNN]] featured the [[IXSIR wine]]ry in a feature for their [[Green building|Greenest buildings]] of 2011.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teo Kermeliotis|first1=Lauren Said-Moorhouse|title=The greenest buildings of 2011|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/12/12/world/europe/green-buildings-2011/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, Raed Abillama Architects were awarded the [[Good Design Award (Chicago)|Green Good Design]] for 2011.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;  In 2014 the [[LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction|Silver Award - Africa Middle East for “Evergreen City, Urban Pine Forest Rehabilitation"]] was awarded to Raëd Abillama Architects for Beirut Pine Forest.

The headquarters for Mitsulift in [[Lebanon]] was completed in 2012 by Raëd Abillama Architects.&lt;ref name=architectism&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Invest – Mitsulift HQ by Raed Abillama Architects|url=http://architectism.com/standard-invest-mitsulift-hq-raed-abillama-architects/|publisher=Architectism|date=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the building had a number of unique features, inlacing the exterior, which was designed to reduce the impact of direct sunlight, reducing heat intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bruneel|first1=Géraldine|title=Mitsulift HQ / Raëd Abillama Architects|url=http://www.archdaily.com/474570/mitsulift-hq-raed-abillama-architects/|publisher=Arch Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; The windows were created at a floor to ceiling height and placed in the shade facing either east or west to maximise natural sunlight, without increasing the heat.&lt;ref name=architectism /&gt;

In late 2013, Raëd Abillama completed the restoration of a 380-year-old winery for [[IXSIR wine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IXSIR Winery by Raëd Abillama Architects|publisher=Delood Design Magazine|date=17 December 2013|url=http://www.delood.com/architecture/ixsir-winery-raëd-abillama-architects}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winery was located outside [[Batroun]] in [[Lebanon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fabricant|first1=Florence|title=Top Chefs and Restaurateurs Are Drawn to Beirut|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/dining/02beirut.html?_r=2&amp;|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and went on to win the POP Architizer A+ Award in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IXSIR Winery - Winner of the Architizer A+ Award|url=http://www.archello.com/en/project/ixsir-winery/1348619#|publisher=Archello}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Architizer A+ 2013 Awards - Winners|url=http://awards.architizer.com/winners/archive/?event=1&amp;id=2|publisher=Architizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project and restoration focused on modernising the building and aspects of the building.&lt;ref name=ixsir&gt;{{cite web|title=Built in nature: IXSIR Winery by Raed Abillama Architects|url=http://www.demagazine.co.uk/architecture/built-in-nature-ixsir-winery-by-raed-abillama-architects|publisher=Design Exchange Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, Raëd also completed the construction of a beach house located in [[Jbeil, Lebanon]], along with other [[villa]]s that received media coverage for their unique designs.&lt;ref name=fidar&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=Caroline|title=Fidar Beach House by Raëd Abillama Architects|url=http://design-milk.com/fidar-beach-house-by-raëd-abillama-architects/|publisher=Design Milk|date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Villa Yarze by Raëd Abillama Architects|url=http://www.homedsgn.com/2013/11/12/villa-yarze-by-raëd-abillama-architects/|publisher=HomeDsgn|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While designing the homes, the architectural firm would often concentrate on various aspects, including everything down to the furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Custom home furniture|url=http://www.usm.com/en-us/magazine/2014/personalize/|publisher=[[USM Modular Furniture]]|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, the brand was also announced as a [[Good Design Award (Chicago)|Good Green Architecture]] 2013 winner for their residential project Faqra Degrees in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Design - Green Architecture 2013|url=https://chi-athenaeum.org/assets/pdf_archives/green/2013_GD_GREEN_LIST.pdf|publisher=Green Good Design 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13055">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[Ridley Scott]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, English film director [[Ridley Scott]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, fell in [[development hell]] or are officially canceled.

== 1970s ==

=== ''Tristan and Isolde'' ===
In the mid-1970s, before the beginning of the filming of ''[[The Duellists]]'', Scott pitched the idea of a film adaptation of [[medieval]] romantic [[legend]] of ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'', and he planned to release this film as his second movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evan Jacobs |url=http://movieweb.com/exclusive-setting-the-period-with-tristan-isolde-executive-producer-ridley-scott/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Setting the Period With Tristan + Isolde Executive Producer Ridley Scott |website=Movieweb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project never materialized at the time, and Scott pitched the idea of ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' during the filming of ''The Duellists'' as a replacement of this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franco |first=James |url=http://www.newsweek.com/james-francos-favorite-mistake-filming-tristan-isolde-63903 |title=James Franco’s Favorite Mistake: Filming Tristan &amp; Isolde |website=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, [[Tristan &amp; Isolde (film)|Tristan &amp; Isolde]], was finally released in 2006 with [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] as the director and with Scott as the producer.

== 1980s ==

=== ''Dune'' ===
Around 1981, Scott was hired to direct a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel D. Snyder |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/the-messy-misunderstood-glory-of-david-lynchs-em-dune-em/284316/ |title=The Messy, Misunderstood Glory of David Lynch's Dune |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scott was finally replaced by [[David Lynch]], and the [[Dune (film)|film]] was released in 1984.

== 1990s ==

=== ''Crisis in the Hot Zone'' ===
In February 1994, Scott signed a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to direct a film adaptation of [[Richard Preston]]'s article ''[[The Hot Zone|Crisis in the Hot Zone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-02-14-1994-1 |title=Now displaying the Daily Variety for February 14, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April 1994, [[Robert Redford]] and [[Jodie Foster]] were in talks for star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-05-02-1994-13 |title=Now displaying the Weekly Variety for May 02, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was finally shut down due to many production problems and Foster's departure from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-19-1994-1 |title=Now displaying the Daily Variety for August 19, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sibylle Berg''' (born 2 June 1962 in [[Weimar]], [[East Germany]]) is a German writer. She writes novels, essays, short stories, and plays.

== Life ==

Sibylle Berg is a recognized contemporary female writer in the German-speaking world, and has been heralded as one of Germany's most provocative writers. Her first novel "Ein Paar Leute suchen das Glück und lachen sich tot" ("A Few People Search For Happiness And Laugh Themselves To Death") was published in 1997 by Reclam Verlag to great acclaim, with one critic dubbing her "the new voice of a young, disenchanted generation". It was later translated into ten languages, used in school classes, and has sold around 400,000 copies.

Berg, who claimed, in the TV-Show "''Willkommen Österreich''", that she was born a man, grew up in Weimar, East Germany, the daughter of a music professor and a librarian. In 1984 she was allowed to leave the GDR permanently and to live in West Germany. She briefly studied oceanography at [[Hamburg University]]. In 1996, she moved to Switzerland to live in her favorite city [[Zurich]]. She married in 2004, attained Swiss citizenship in 2012, and lives for increasingly longer periods in Israel.

Her writing has been compared to that of [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Bret Easton Ellis]], [[Michel Houellebecq]], and [[Will Self]]. She has become an iconic figure for Germany's alternative subcultures, and has gathered a huge following in Europe's LGBTQ and artistic communities.
Sibylle Berg has now written 20 plays, 11 novels, as well as essays and columns for various newspapers and magazines. Her works have been translated into 34 languages. She has also written travel reports about the [[Khmer Rouge]], the Bosnian conflict, the Bangladesh slums, and the gold miners of the Amazon. In March 2013, she co-directed her play "Fear Travels With Us" at the Schauspiel Stuttgart, and in the same year opened the "A Day With..." series at the Berliner Festspielhaus, where she curated a six-hour event, a vast performance collage that comprised both a showcase of her own work as well as the work of 20 other artists.

In October 2015, she directed the world premier of her play "How To Sell A Murder House" at the Theater Neumarkt in Zurich, working with the actors [[Caroline Peters]] and Marcus Kiepe. In 2015, the translation of her play "And Now: The World" toured successfully throughout the UK.
She has also collaborated with several artists, many of whom have become her friends - [[Jon Pylypchuk]], Dawn Mellor, Ute Mahler, [[Mathilde Ter Heinje]], [[Gabríela Friðriksdóttir]], [[Phillip Boa]], [[Sophie Hunger]] and the late [[Michael Glawogger]].
Sibylle Berg's readings are multimedia events that combine video, live music, and the work of various collaborators.
In autumn 2015 she delivered the laudation for Karl Ove Knausgård on his reception of the "Welt Literaturpreis", presented every year by the book supplement of Die Welt newspaper.
Since January 2016, she has been working with the comedians Jan Böhmermann and Olli Schulz on the talk show "Schulz &amp; Böhmermann" for German TV network ZDF.

'''Sigmund Freud's views on homosexuality''' have been described as deterministic, whereas he would ascribe biological and psychological factors in explaining the principal causes of [[homosexuality]]. [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] believed that humans are born with [[Polymorphous perversity|unfocused sexual libidinal drives]], and therefore argued that homosexuality might be a deviation from this. Nevertheless, he also felt that certain deeply rooted forms of homosexuality were difficult or impossible to change.

==Overview==
Freud's most important articles on homosexuality were written between 1905, when he published ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'', and 1922, when he published "Certain Neurotic Mechanisms in Jealousy, Paranoia, and Homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freud believed that all humans were bisexual, by which he primarily meant that everyone incorporates aspects of both sexes, and that everyone is sexually attracted to both sexes. In his view, this was true anatomically and therefore also mentally and psychologically. Heterosexuality and homosexuality both developed from this original bisexual disposition.&lt;ref name="Ruse"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ruse|1988|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the causes of homosexuality, Freud mentions the distressing heterosexual experience: "Those cases are of particular interest in which the libido changes over to an inverted sexual object after a distressing experience with a normal one."&lt;ref name="3essays"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1905|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud appears to have been undecided whether or not homosexuality was [[pathological]], expressing different views on this issue at different times and places in his work. Freud frequently called homosexuality an "inversion", something which in his view was distinct from the necessarily pathological perversions, and suggested that several distinct kinds might exist, cautioning that his conclusions about it were based on a small and not necessarily representative sample of patients.&lt;ref name="Lewes"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexuality" /&gt;

Freud derived much of his information on homosexuality from psychiatrists and sexologists such as [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] and [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], and was also influenced by [[Eugen Steinach]], a [[Vienna|Viennese]] endocrinologist who transplanted [[testicle]]s from straight men into gay men in attempts to change their sexual orientation. Freud stated that Steinach's research had "thrown a strong light on the organic determinants of [[homoeroticism]]",&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexualityP58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewes|1988|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cautioned that it was premature to expect that the operations he performed would make possible a therapy that could be generally applied. In his view, such transplant operations would be effective in changing sexual orientation only in cases in which homosexuality was strongly associated with physical characteristics typical of the opposite sex, and probably no similar therapy could be applied to lesbianism.&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudOnSexuality"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeVay1996" /&gt; In fact Steinach's method was doomed to failure because the [[immune system]]s of his patients rejected the transplanted glands, and was eventually exposed as ineffective and often harmful.&lt;ref name="LeVay1996"&gt;{{Harvnb|LeVay|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female homosexuality==
Freud's main discussion of female homosexuality was the 1920 paper "The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman," which described his analysis of a young woman who had entered therapy because her parents were concerned that she was a [[lesbian]]. Her father hoped that psychoanalysis would cure her lesbianism, but in Freud's view, the prognosis was unfavourable because of the circumstances under which the woman entered therapy, and because the homosexuality was not an illness or neurotic conflict. Freud wrote that changing homosexuality was difficult and therefore possible only under unusually favourable conditions, observing that "in general to undertake to convert a fully developed homosexual into a heterosexual does not offer much more prospect of success than the reverse."&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesIIP376"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Success meant making heterosexual feeling possible rather than eliminating homosexual feelings.&lt;ref name="SigmundFreudCaseHistoriesII"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on attempts to change homosexuality==
Freud believed that homosexuals could seldom be convinced that sex with someone of the opposite sex would provide them with the same pleasure they derived from sex with someone of the same sex. Patients often had only superficial reasons to want to become heterosexual, pursuing treatment due to [[Minority stress|social disapproval]], which was not a strong enough motive for change. Some patients might have no real desire to become heterosexual, seeking treatment only so that they could convince themselves that they had done everything possible to change, leaving them free to return to homosexuality afterwards. Freud, therefore, told the parents only that he was prepared to study their daughter to determine what effects therapy might have. Freud concluded that he was probably dealing with a case of biologically innate homosexuality, and eventually broke off the treatment because of what he saw as his patient's hostility to men.&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1991|pp=371–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OconnorandRyan"&gt;{{Harvnb|O’Connor|Ryan|1993|pp=30–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1935 letter===
In 1935, Freud wrote to a mother who had asked him to treat her son's homosexuality, a letter that would later become famous:&lt;ref name="Lewes" /&gt;

{{quote|I gather from your letter that your son is a homosexual. I am most impressed by the fact that you do not mention this term yourself in your information about him. May I question you why you avoid it? Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development. Many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals, several of the greatest men among them. (Plato, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, etc). It is a great injustice to persecute homosexuality as a crime&amp;nbsp;–and a cruelty, too. If you do not believe me, read the books of [[Havelock Ellis]].
By asking me if I can help [your son], you mean, I suppose, if I can abolish homosexuality and make normal heterosexuality take its place. The answer is, in a general way we cannot promise to achieve it. In a certain number of cases we succeed in developing the blighted germs of heterosexual tendencies, which are present in every homosexual; in the majority of cases it is no more possible. It is a question of the quality and the age of the individual. The result of treatment cannot be predicted.

What analysis can do for your son runs in a different line. If he is unhappy, neurotic, torn by conflicts, inhibited in his social life, analysis may bring him harmony, peace of mind, full efficiency, whether he remains homosexual or gets changed.&lt;ref name="ErnstLFreud"&gt;{{Harvnb|Freud|1992|pp=423–424}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}

In [[abstract algebra]], the '''symmetric group''' defined over any [[set (mathematics)|set]] is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] are all the [[bijection]]s from the set to itself, and whose [[group operation]] is the [[function composition|composition of functions]].  In particular, the finite symmetric group '''S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''' defined over a [[finite set]] of ''n'' symbols consists of the [[permutation]] operations that can be performed on the ''n'' symbols.&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Since there are ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) possible permutation operations that can be performed on a [[tuple]] composed of ''n'' symbols, it follows that the number of elements (the [[Order (group theory)|order]]) of the symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is ''n''!.

Although symmetric groups can be defined on infinite sets, this article focuses on the finite symmetric groups: their applications, their elements, their [[conjugacy class]]es, a [[finitely presented group|finite presentation]], their [[subgroup]]s, their automorphism groups, and their [[group representation |representation]] theory. For the remainder of this article, "symmetric group" will mean a symmetric group on a finite set.

The symmetric group is important to diverse areas of mathematics such as [[Galois theory]], [[invariant theory]], the [[representation theory of Lie groups]], and [[combinatorics]]. [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every group ''G'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group on ''G''.

== Definition and first properties ==
The symmetric group on a finite set ''X'' is the group whose elements are all bijective functions from ''X'' to ''X'' and whose group operation is that of [[function composition]].&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def /&gt; For finite sets, "permutations" and "bijective functions" refer to the same operation, namely rearrangement. The symmetric group of '''degree''' ''n'' is the symmetric group on the set {{nowrap|1=''X'' = { 1, 2, ..., ''n'' }.}}

The symmetric group on a set ''X'' is denoted in various ways including S&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, 𝔖&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, Σ&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''! and Sym(''X'').&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def /&gt;  If ''X'' is the set {{nowrap|{ 1, 2, ..., ''n'' },}} then the symmetric group on ''X'' is also denoted S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,&lt;ref name=Jacobson-def /&gt; 𝔖&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Sym(''n'').

Symmetric groups on infinite sets behave quite differently from symmetric groups on finite sets, and are discussed in {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=Ch. 11}}, {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=Ch. 8}}, and {{harv|Cameron|1999}}.

The symmetric group on a set of ''n'' elements has [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n''! (the [[factorial]] of ''n'').&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 32. Theorem 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[abelian group|abelian]] if and only if ''n'' is less than or equal to 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symmetric Group is not Abelian/Proof 1|url=https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Symmetric_Group_is_not_Abelian/Proof_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} (the [[empty set]] and the [[singleton set]]), the symmetric group is [[trivial group|trivial]] (it has order {{nowrap|1=0! = 1! = 1}}). The group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[solvable group|solvable]] if and only if {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 4}}. This is an essential part of the proof of the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] that shows that for every {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 4}} there are [[polynomial]]s of degree ''n'' which are not solvable by radicals, that is, the solutions cannot be expressed by performing a finite number of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and root extraction on the polynomial's coefficients.

== Applications ==
The symmetric group on a set of size ''n'' is the [[Galois group]] of the general [[polynomial]] of degree ''n'' and plays an important role in [[Galois theory]].  In [[invariant theory]], the symmetric group acts on the variables of a multi-variate function, and the functions left invariant are the so-called [[symmetric function]]s.  In the [[representation theory of Lie groups]], the [[representation theory of the symmetric group]] plays a fundamental role through the ideas of [[Schur functor]]s.  In the theory of [[Coxeter group]]s, the symmetric group is the Coxeter group of type A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and occurs as the [[Weyl group]] of the [[general linear group]].  In [[combinatorics]], the symmetric groups, their elements ([[permutation]]s), and their [[group representation|representations]] provide a rich source of problems involving [[Young tableaux]], [[plactic monoid]]s, and the [[Bruhat order]].  [[Subgroup]]s of symmetric groups are called [[permutation group]]s and are widely studied because of their importance in understanding [[group action]]s, [[homogeneous space]]s, and [[automorphism group]]s of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, such as the [[Higman–Sims group]] and the [[Higman–Sims graph]].

== Elements ==
The elements of the symmetric group on a set ''X'' are the [[permutation]]s of ''X''.

=== Multiplication ===
The group operation in a symmetric group is [[function composition]], denoted by the symbol ∘ or simply by juxtaposition of the permutations. The composition {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} of permutations ''f'' and ''g'', pronounced "''f'' of ''g''", maps any element ''x'' of ''X'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')). Concretely, let (see [[permutation]] for an explanation of notation):

: &lt;math&gt; f = (1\ 3)(4\ 5)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 4\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; g = (1\ 2\ 5)(3\ 4)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 2 &amp; 5 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying ''f'' after ''g'' maps 1 first to 2 and then 2 to itself; 2 to 5 and then to 4; 3 to 4 and then to 5, and so on. So composing ''f'' and ''g'' gives
: &lt;math&gt; fg = f\circ g = (1\ 2\ 4)(3\ 5)=\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp;3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 1 &amp; 3\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[Cyclic permutation|cycle]] of length {{nowrap|1=''L'' = ''k'' · ''m''}}, taken to the ''k''-th power, will decompose into ''k'' cycles of length ''m'': For example, ({{nowrap|1=''k'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 3}}),
: &lt;math&gt; (1~2~3~4~5~6)^2 = (1~3~5) (2~4~6).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Verification of group axioms ===
To check that the symmetric group on a set ''X'' is indeed a [[group (mathematics)|group]], it is necessary to verify the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.&lt;ref&gt;modern algebra Author A. R. Vasishtha, A. K. Vasishtha Publisher Krishna Prakashan Media&lt;/ref&gt;
# The operation of [[function composition]] is closed in the set of permutations of the given set ''X''.
# [[Function composition]] is always associative.
# The trivial bijection that assigns each element of ''X'' to itself serves as an identity for the group.
# Every bijection has an [[inverse function]] that undoes its action, and thus each element of a symmetric group does have an inverse which is a permutation too.

=== Transpositions ===
{{main article|Transposition (mathematics)}}
A '''transposition''' is a permutation which exchanges two elements and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. Every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions; for instance, the permutation ''g'' from above can be written as ''g'' = (1 2)(2 5)(3 4). Since ''g'' can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions, it is then called an [[Even and odd permutations|odd permutation]], whereas ''f'' is an even permutation.

The representation of a permutation as a product of transpositions is not unique; however, the number of transpositions needed to represent a given permutation is either always even or always odd. There are several short proofs of the invariance of this parity of a permutation.

The product of two even permutations is even, the product of two odd permutations is even, and all other products are odd.  Thus we can define the '''sign''' of a permutation:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sgn}f = \begin{cases} +1, &amp; \text{if }f\mbox { is even} \\ -1, &amp; \text{if }f \text{ is odd}. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

With this definition,
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sgn}\colon \mathrm{S}_n \rightarrow \{+1, -1\}\ &lt;/math&gt;
is a [[group homomorphism]] ({+1, –1} is a group under multiplication, where +1 is e, the [[neutral element]]). The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this homomorphism, that is, the set of all even permutations, is called the '''[[alternating group]]''' A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a [[normal subgroup]] of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} it has {{nowrap|''n''!/2}} elements. The group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[semidirect product]] of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and any subgroup generated by a single transposition.

Furthermore, every permutation can be written as a product of ''[[adjacent transposition]]s'', that is, transpositions of the form {{nowrap|(''a'' ''a''+1)}}.  For instance, the permutation ''g'' from above can also be written as {{nowrap|1=''g'' = (4 5)(3 4)(4 5)(1 2)(2 3)(3 4)(4 5)}}. The sorting algorithm [[bubble sort]] is an application of this fact.  The representation of a permutation as a product of adjacent transpositions is also not unique.

=== Cycles ===
A [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] of ''length'' ''k'' is a permutation ''f'' for which there exists an element ''x'' in {1,...,''n''} such that ''x'', ''f''(''x''), ''f''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), ..., ''f''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = ''x'' are the only elements moved by ''f''; it is required that {{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 2}} since with {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 1}} the element ''x'' itself would not be moved either. The permutation ''h'' defined by

:&lt;math&gt;h = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 4 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 5\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

is a cycle of length three, since {{nowrap|1=''h''(1) = 4}}, {{nowrap|1=''h''(4) = 3}} and {{nowrap|1=''h''(3) = 1}}, leaving 2 and 5 untouched. We denote such a cycle by {{nowrap|(1 4 3)}}, but it could equally well be written {{nowrap|(4 3 1)}} or {{nowrap|(3 1 4)}} by starting at a different point. The order of a cycle is equal to its length. Cycles of length two are transpositions. Two cycles are ''disjoint'' if they move disjoint subsets of elements. Disjoint cycles [[Commutative property|commute]]: for example, in S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; there is the equality {{nowrap|1=(4 1 3)(2 5 6) = (2 5 6)(4 1 3)}}. Every element of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be written as a product of disjoint cycles; this representation is unique [[up to]] the order of the factors, and the freedom present in representing each individual cycle by choosing its starting point.

Cycles admit the following conjugation property with any permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, this property is often used to obtain its [[Symmetric group#Generators and relations|Generators and relations]].

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b &amp; c &amp; \ldots \end{pmatrix}\sigma^{-1}=\begin{pmatrix}\sigma(a) &amp; \sigma(b) &amp; \sigma(c) &amp; \ldots\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Special elements ===
Certain elements of the symmetric group of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} are of particular interest (these can be generalized to the symmetric group of any finite totally ordered set, but not to that of an unordered set).

The '''{{visible anchor|order reversing permutation}}''' is the one given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \cdots &amp; n\\
n &amp; n-1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the unique maximal element with respect to the [[Bruhat order]] and the
[[longest element of a Coxeter group|longest element]] in the symmetric group with respect to generating set consisting of the adjacent transpositions {{nowrap|(''i'' ''i''+1)}}, {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'' − 1}}.

This is an involution, and consists of &lt;math&gt;\lfloor n/2 \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; (non-adjacent) transpositions
:&lt;math&gt;(1\,n)(2\,n-1)\cdots,\text{ or }\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\text{ adjacent transpositions: }&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;(n\,n-1)(n-1\,n-2)\cdots(2\,1)(n-1\,n-2)(n-2\,n-3)\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

so it thus has sign:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{sgn}(\rho_n) = (-1)^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} =(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} = \begin{cases}
+1 &amp; n \equiv 0,1 \pmod{4}\\
-1 &amp; n \equiv 2,3 \pmod{4}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
which is 4-periodic in ''n''.

In S&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''[[Faro shuffle|perfect shuffle]]'' is the permutation that splits the set into 2 piles and interleaves them. Its sign is also &lt;math&gt;(-1)^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the reverse on ''n'' elements and perfect shuffle on 2''n'' elements have the same sign; these are important to the classification of [[Clifford algebra]]s, which are 8-periodic.

== Conjugacy classes ==
The [[conjugacy class]]es of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; correspond to the cycle structures of permutations; that is, two elements of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are conjugate in S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if they consist of the same number of disjoint cycles of the same lengths. For instance, in S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) are conjugate; (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 2)(4 5) are not. A conjugating element of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; can be constructed in "two line notation" by placing the "cycle notations" of the two conjugate permutations on top of one another.  Continuing the previous example:

:&lt;math&gt;k = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\ 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 5\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which can be written as the product of cycles, namely: (2 4).

This permutation then relates (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) via conjugation, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;(2~4)\circ(1~2~3)(4~5)\circ(2~4)=(1~4~3)(2~5).&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear that such a permutation is not unique.

== Low degree groups ==
{{See also|Representation theory of the symmetric group#Special cases}}
The low-degree symmetric groups have simpler and exceptional structure, and often must be treated separately.

;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: The symmetric groups on the [[empty set]] and the [[singleton set]] are trivial, which corresponds to {{nowrap|1=0! = 1! = 1}}.  In this case the alternating group agrees with the symmetric group, rather than being an index 2 subgroup, and the sign map is trivial. In the case of S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, its only member is the [[empty function]].

;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: This group consists of exactly two elements: the identity and the permutation swapping the two points.  It is a [[cyclic group]] and is thus [[abelian group|abelian]].  In [[Galois theory]], this corresponds to the fact that the [[quadratic formula]] gives a direct solution to the general [[quadratic polynomial]] after extracting only a single root.  In [[invariant theory]], the representation theory of the symmetric group on two points is quite simple and is seen as writing a function of two variables as a sum of its symmetric and anti-symmetric parts: Setting {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') = f(''x'', ''y'') + f(''y'', ''x'')}}, and {{nowrap|1=''f''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') = ''f''(''x'', ''y'') − ''f''(''y'', ''x'')}}, one gets that {{nowrap|1=2⋅''f'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  This process is known as [[symmetrization]].

;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the first nonabelian symmetric group.  This group is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group of order 6]], the group of reflection and rotation symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]], since these symmetries permute the three vertices of the triangle. Cycles of length two correspond to reflections, and cycles of length three are rotations.  In Galois theory, the sign map from S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to the resolving quadratic for a [[cubic polynomial]], as discovered by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], while the A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; kernel corresponds to the use of the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of order 3 in the solution, in the form of [[Lagrange resolvent]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: The group [[Wikiversity:Symmetric group S4|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] is isomorphic to the group of proper rotations about opposite faces, opposite diagonals and opposite edges, [[Rencontres numbers|9, 8 and 6]] permutations, of the [[cube]].&lt;ref&gt;Die Untergruppenverbände der Gruppen der ordnung weniger als 100, Habilitationsschrift, J. Neubuser, Universität Kiel, Germany, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the group [[Alternating group|A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a [[Klein four-group]] V as a proper [[normal subgroup]], namely the even transpositions {{nowrap|{(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)},}} with quotient S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In [[Galois theory]], this map corresponds to the resolving cubic to a [[quartic polynomial]], which allows the quartic to be solved by radicals, as established by [[Lodovico Ferrari]]. The Klein group can be understood in terms of the [[Lagrange resolvent]]s of the quartic.  The map from S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also yields a 2-dimensional irreducible representation, which is an irreducible representation of a symmetric group of degree ''n'' of dimension below {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, which only occurs for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}.

;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;: S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the first non-solvable symmetric group.  Along with the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(2, 5)}} and the [[icosahedral group]] {{nowrap|A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; × S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the three non-solvable groups of order 120, up to isomorphism.  S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Galois group]] of the general [[quintic equation]], and the fact that S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not a [[solvable group]] translates into the non-existence of a general formula to solve [[quintic polynomial]]s by radicals.  There is an exotic inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a [[#Transitive subgroup anchor|transitive subgroup]]; the obvious inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} fixes a point and thus is not transitive. This yields the outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, discussed below, and corresponds to the resolvent sextic of a quintic.

;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;: Unlike all other symmetric groups, S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, has an [[outer automorphism]].  Using the language of [[Galois theory]], this can also be understood in terms of [[Lagrange resolvents]]. The resolvent of a quintic is of degree 6—this corresponds to an exotic inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a transitive subgroup (the obvious inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} fixes a point and thus is not transitive) and, while this map does not make the general quintic solvable, it yields the exotic outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;—see [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups]] for details.

:Note that while A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; have an exceptional [[Schur multiplier]] (a [[Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|triple cover]]) and that these extend to triple covers of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, these do not correspond to exceptional Schur multipliers of the symmetric group.

=== Maps between symmetric groups ===

Other than the trivial map {{nowrap|1=S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → 1 ≅ S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the sign map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the most notable homomorphisms between symmetric groups, in order of [[relative dimension]], are:
* {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} corresponding to the exceptional normal subgroup {{nowrap|V &lt; A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}};
* {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} (or rather, a class of such maps up to inner automorphism) corresponding to the outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.
* {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;}} as a transitive subgroup, yielding the outer automorphism of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; as discussed above.
There are also a host of other homomorphisms {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} where {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; ''m''}}.

== Properties ==
Symmetric groups are [[Coxeter group]]s and [[reflection group]]s.  They can be realized as a group of reflections with respect to hyperplanes {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 ≤ ''i'' &lt; ''j'' ≤ ''n''}}.  [[Braid group]]s B&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; admit symmetric groups S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as [[quotient group]]s.

[[Cayley's theorem]] states that every group ''G'' is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements of ''G'', as a group acts on itself faithfully by (left or right) multiplication.

== Relation with alternating group ==
For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Simple group|simple]], and the induced quotient is the sign map: {{nowrap|A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} which is split by taking a transposition of two elements. Thus S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the semidirect product {{nowrap|A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋊ S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and has no other proper normal subgroups, as they would intersect A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; in either the identity (and thus themselves be the identity or a 2-element group, which is not normal), or in A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (and thus themselves be A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; acts on its subgroup A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by conjugation, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 6}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the full automorphism group of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;: Aut(A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ≅ S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. Conjugation by even elements are [[inner automorphism]]s of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; while the [[outer automorphism]] of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of order 2 corresponds to conjugation by an odd element. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, there is an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; so S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is not the full automorphism group of A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Conversely, for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 6}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has no outer automorphisms, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2}} it has no center, so for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2, 6}} it is a [[complete group]], as discussed in [[#Automorphism group|automorphism group]], below.

For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[almost simple group]], as it lies between the simple group A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its group of automorphisms.

&lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; can be embedded into &lt;math&gt;A_{n+2}&lt;/math&gt; by appending the transposition &lt;math&gt;(n+1,n+2)&lt;/math&gt; to all odd permutations, while embedding into &lt;math&gt;A_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is impossible for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Generators and relations ==
The symmetric group on ''n''-letters, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, may be described as follows. It has generators: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and relations:
*&lt;math&gt;{\sigma_i}^2 = 1,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i\sigma_j = \sigma_j\sigma_i \text{ if } j \neq i\pm 1,&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1})^3 =1.\ &lt;/math&gt;

One thinks of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i&lt;/math&gt; as swapping the ''i''th and {{nowrap|(''i'' + 1)th}} position.

Other popular generating sets include the set of transpositions that swap 1 and ''i'' for {{nowrap|2 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}} and a set containing any ''n''-cycle and a 2-cycle of adjacent elements in the ''n''-cycle.

== Subgroup structure ==
A [[subgroup]] of a symmetric group is called a [[permutation group]].

=== Normal subgroups ===
The [[normal subgroup]]s of the finite symmetric groups are well understood. If {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 2}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has at most 2 elements, and so has no nontrivial proper subgroups. The [[alternating group]] of degree ''n'' is always a normal subgroup, a proper one for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} and nontrivial for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}; for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}} it is in fact the only non-identity proper normal subgroup of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, except when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}} where there is one additional such normal subgroup, which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four group]].

The symmetric group on an infinite set does not have an associated alternating group: not all elements can be written as a (finite) product of transpositions. However it does contain a normal subgroup ''S'' of permutations that fix all but finitely many elements, and such permutations can be classified as either even or odd. The even elements of ''S'' form the alternating subgroup ''A'' of ''S'', and since ''A'' is even a [[characteristic subgroup]] of ''S'', it is also a normal subgroup of the full symmetric group of the infinite set. The groups ''A'' and ''S'' are the only non-identity proper normal subgroups of the symmetric group on a countably infinite set. For more details see {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=Ch. 11.3}} or {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=Ch. 8.1}}.

=== Maximal subgroups ===
{{expand section|date=September 2009}}

The [[maximal subgroup]]s of the finite symmetric groups fall into three classes: the intransitive, the imprimitive, and the primitive.  The intransitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form {{nowrap|Sym(''k'') × Sym(''n'' − ''k'')}} for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''k'' &lt; ''n''/2}}.  The imprimitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form Sym(''k'') wr Sym(''n''/''k'') where {{nowrap|2 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''/2}} is a proper divisor of ''n'' and "wr" denotes the [[wreath product]] acting imprimitively.  The primitive maximal subgroups are more difficult to identify, but with the assistance of the [[O'Nan–Scott theorem]] and the [[classification of finite simple groups]], {{harv|Liebeck|Praeger|Saxl|1988}} gave a fairly satisfactory description of the maximal subgroups of this type&lt;!-- though beware of typos in the low degrees--&gt; according to {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|p=268}}.

=== Sylow subgroups ===
The [[Sylow subgroup]]s of the symmetric groups are important examples of [[p-group|''p''-groups]].  They are more easily described in special cases first:

The Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p'' are just the cyclic subgroups generated by ''p''-cycles.  There are {{nowrap|1=(''p'' − 1)!/(''p'' − 1) = (''p'' − 2)!}} such subgroups simply by counting generators.  The [[normalizer]] therefore has order ''p''·(''p''−1) and is known as a [[Frobenius group]] {{nowrap|''F''&lt;sub&gt;''p''(''p'' − 1)&lt;/sub&gt;}} (especially for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}), and is the [[affine general linear group]], {{nowrap|AGL(1, ''p'')}}.

The Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are the [[wreath product]] of two cyclic groups of order ''p''.  For instance, when ''p'' = 3, a Sylow 3-subgroup of Sym(9) is generated by ''a'' = (1 4 7)(2 5 8)(3 6 9) and the elements ''x'' = (1 2 3), ''y'' = (4 5 6), ''z'' = (7 8 9)&lt;!-- or just use (1,2,3) --&gt;, and every element of the Sylow 3-subgroup has the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;''y''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''z''&lt;sup&gt;''l''&lt;/sup&gt; for 0 ≤ ''i'',''j'',''k'',''l'' ≤ 2.

The Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are sometimes denoted W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), and using this notation one has that {{nowrap|W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'' + 1)}} is the wreath product of W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') and W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(1).

In general, the Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''n'' are a direct product of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; copies of W&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''i''), where 0 ≤ ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''p'' − 1 and ''n'' = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''·''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;·''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; (the base ''p'' expansion of ''n'').

For instance, W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1) =&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2) =&amp;nbsp;D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[dihedral group of order 8]], and so a Sylow 2-subgroup of the symmetric group of degree 7 is generated by { (1,3)(2,4), (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) } and is isomorphic to D&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

These calculations are attributed to {{harv|Kaloujnine|1948}} and described in more detail in {{harv|Rotman|1995|p=176}}.  Note however that {{harv|Kerber|1971|p=26}} attributes the result to an 1844 work of [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], and mentions that it is even covered in textbook form in {{harv|Netto|1882|loc=§39–40}}.

===&lt;span id="Transitive subgroup anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Transitive subgroups ===&lt;!-- Transitive subgroup redirects to this anchor--&gt;
A '''transitive subgroup''' of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a subgroup whose action on {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;,...,&amp;nbsp;''n''} is [[transitive action|transitive]]. For example, the Galois group of a ([[finite extension|finite]]) [[Galois extension]] is a transitive subgroup of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for some ''n''.

For {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2, 6}}, S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[complete group]]: its [[center (group theory)|center]] and [[outer automorphism group]] are both trivial.

For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, the automorphism group is trivial, but S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not trivial: it is isomorphic to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is abelian, and hence the center is the whole group.

For {{math|1=''n'' = 6}}, it has an outer automorphism of order 2: {{nowrap|1=Out(S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) = C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the automorphism group is a semidirect product
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{S}_6)=\mathrm{S}_6 \rtimes \mathrm{C}_2.\ &lt;/math&gt;

In fact, for any set ''X'' of cardinality other than 6, every automorphism of the symmetric group on ''X'' is inner, a result first due to {{harv|Schreier|Ulam|1937}} according to {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|p=259}}.

== Homology ==
{{see also|Alternating group#Group homology}}
The [[group homology]] of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is quite regular and stabilizes: the first homology (concretely, the [[abelianization]]) is:

:&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{S}_n,\mathbf{Z}) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; n &lt; 2\\
\mathbf{Z}/2 &amp; n \geq 2.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The first homology group is the abelianization, and corresponds to the sign map S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; which is the abelianization for ''n'' ≥ 2; for ''n'' &lt; 2 the symmetric group is trivial. This homology is easily computed as follows: S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is generated by involutions (2-cycles, which have order 2), so the only non-trivial maps {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are to S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and all involutions are conjugate, hence map to the same element in the abelianization (since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups). Thus the only possible maps {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≅ {±1} }} send an involution to 1 (the trivial map) or to −1 (the sign map). One must also show that the sign map is well-defined, but assuming that, this gives the first homology of S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The second homology (concretely, the [[Schur multiplier]]) is:
:&lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{S}_n,\mathbf{Z}) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; n &lt; 4\\
\mathbf{Z}/2 &amp; n \geq 4.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
This was computed in {{Harv|Schur|1911}}, and corresponds to the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover of the symmetric group]], 2 · S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that the [[exceptional object|exceptional]] low-dimensional homology of the alternating group (&lt;math&gt;H_1(\mathrm{A}_3)\cong H_1(\mathrm{A}_4) \cong \mathrm{C}_3,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to non-trivial abelianization, and &lt;math&gt;H_2(\mathrm{A}_6)\cong H_2(\mathrm{A}_7) \cong \mathrm{C}_6,&lt;/math&gt; due to the exceptional 3-fold cover) does not change the homology of the symmetric group; the alternating group phenomena do yield symmetric group phenomena – the map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{A}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{C}_3&lt;/math&gt; extends to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{S}_3,&lt;/math&gt; and the triple covers of A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; extend to triple covers of S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; – but these are not ''homological'' – the map &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{S}_4 \twoheadrightarrow \mathrm{S}_3&lt;/math&gt; does not change the abelianization of S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and the triple covers do not correspond to homology either.

The homology "stabilizes" in the sense of [[stable homotopy]] theory: there is an inclusion map {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and for fixed ''k'', the induced map on homology {{nowrap|''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) → ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is an isomorphism for sufficiently high ''n''. This is analogous to the homology of families [[Lie groups]] stabilizing.

The homology of the infinite symmetric group is computed in {{Harv|Nakaoka|1961}}, with the cohomology algebra forming a [[Hopf algebra]].

== Representation theory ==
{{main article|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}

The [[representation theory of the symmetric group]] is a particular case of the [[representation theory of finite groups]], for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from [[symmetric function]] theory to problems of [[quantum mechanics]] for a number of [[identical particles]].

The symmetric group S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; has order ''n''&lt;nowiki&gt;!&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Its [[conjugacy class]]es are labeled by [[integer partition|partition]]s of&amp;nbsp;''n''. Therefore, according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent [[irreducible representation]]s, over the [[complex number]]s, is equal to the number of partitions of&amp;nbsp;''n''. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representation by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of ''n'' or equivalently [[Young diagram]]s of size&amp;nbsp;''n''.

Each such irreducible representation can be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the [[Young symmetrizer]]s acting on a space generated by the [[Young tableau]]x of shape given by the Young diagram.

Over other [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s the situation can become much more complicated.  If the field ''K'' has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] equal to zero or greater than ''n'' then by [[Maschke's theorem]] the [[group algebra]] ''K''S&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).

However, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called ''[[Specht modules]]'', and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]]s are not known in general.

The determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.

'''''The Aryan''''' (1916) is an American [[silent film|silent era]] [[western (genre)|western]] [[film|motion picture]] starring [[William S. Hart]], [[Gertrude Claire]], [[Charles K. French]], [[Louise Glaum]], and [[Bessie Love]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/A/Aryan1916.html ''The Aryan'' at silentera.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[film director|Directed]] by [[William S. Hart]] and [[film producer|produced]] by [[Thomas H. Ince]], the [[screenplay]] was written by [[C. Gardner Sullivan]].

Although Hart was assisted by [[Reginald Barker]] and Clifford Smith, he mostly directed the movie by himself. Hart's salary as both actor and director was $150 per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hal|last=Erickson|website=AllMovie Guide|title=''The Aryan'' (1916)|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-aryan-v84007|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prints of the film survive in the [[Library of Congress]] and at the [[Museo del Cine]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/movies/05metropolis.html|title=Footage Restored to Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis''|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Hart-william-the-aryan-1916.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from the film.]]
A hard working miner, Steve Denton (played by Hart), has become rich from years of [[prospecting]]. He takes his fortune and leaves to visit his ill mother, Mrs. Denton (played by Claire). 

In the town of Yellow Ridge, however, he is detained by a seductive dance hall girl named Trixie (played by Glaum). Also known as "the firefly," Trixie not only cheats him out of his gold, but also conceals a message that was [[telegraphy|wired]] to him by his dying mother.

Learning the next day that his mother is dead, Denton is infuriated about being cheated and betrayed by Trixie, who pretended to be good, and other false friends. In his rage, he kills Trixie's lover, Chip Emmett (played by Mayall), and kidnaps her. Dragging her by the hair of her head, he takes her into the desert. Enslaving Trixie in his desert hideaway, Denton turns his back on "[[White people|white]] civilization." He hates all white men and women and assumes the leadership of a band of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] and [[Mexican people|Mexican]] bandits.

Two years later, a wagon-train of [[Mississippi]] farmers who are lost and dying in the desert appeal to Denton for help. He refuses to assist them. He is secretly visited that night by Mary Jane Garth (played by Love), an innocent and virtuous young woman among the migrants who bravely confronts the Indians and Mexicans.

She pleads their cause and expresses her belief that no white man would refuse to protect a woman in distress. Deeply moved, Denton is redeemed. He guides the wagon-train out of the desert and then resumes his wanderings.

==Cast==
*[[William S. Hart]] as Steve Denton
*[[Gertrude Claire]] as Mrs. Denton
*[[Charles K. French]] as "Ivory" Wells
*[[Bessie Love]] as Mary Jane Garth
*[[Louise Glaum]] as Trixie, "the firefly"
*[[Herschel Mayall]] as Chip Emmett
*[[Ernest Swallow]] as Mexican Pete
*[[Enid Bennett]] in an undetermined role
*[[Jean Hersholt]]
*[[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]] as an extra (uncredited)

==Production==
Hart was given a [[screenplay]] by the [[screenwriter]] [[C. Gardner Sullivan]] in which the hero had, according to Hart, "no motive for his hardness." He argued that the audience needed an explanation. Sullivan preferred the idea that his ruthless personality was simply a given, but eventually accepted Hart's wishes. 

Hart wanted [[Mae Marsh]] for the role as Mary Jane, but Marsh was working on a [[D. W. Griffith]] movie at the time. Griffith recommended a new actress, [[Bessie Love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Hart|title=My Life – East and West|year=1929|page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie was made at the height of Hart's career, but was unusual because he played a ruthless individual described as "hard as flint." As the title suggests, the movie draws on racial ideologies of the era. Hart stated that the central character, Steve Denton, was "a white man, who, foreswearing his race, makes outlaw Mexicans his comrades and allows white women to be attacked by them."&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald L.|last=Davis|title=William S. Hart: Projecting the American West|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2003|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart believed this movie to be "one of the best westerns ever made."&lt;ref name = "ron"/&gt;

[[File:The Paston Treasure.jpg|thumb|''The Paston Treasure'' circa 1670 (246 x 165 cm)]]
'''''The Paston Treasure''''' is an historically rare record of a ''[[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinet of treasures]]'' in British collecting. Commissioned by either Sir [[Robert Paston]] or his father [[Sir William Paston, 1st Baronet|Sir William Paston]] in the early 1670s,&lt;ref&gt;https://britishart.yale.edu/exhibitions/paston-treasure-microcosm-known-world&lt;/ref&gt; the oil painting depicts a small fraction of the Paston family's collected treasures. It was executed by an unknown Dutch artist who resided at the Paston family residence at [[Oxnead]] Hall near [[Aylsham]] in [[Norfolk]] for approximately 3 months, in order to complete the commission.

The objects were collected by Robert and his father, Sir William Paston (c.1610–1663) who made acquisitions on a long journey travelling through Europe and on to Cairo and Jerusalem. The collection consisted of over 200 objects and included many natural curiosities made into decorative art objects, such as mounted seashells and ostrich eggs. The painting was unknown for centuries, and before it was donated to the [[Norwich Castle Museum]] in 1947, its last owner warned that it was "very faded, of no artistic value, only curious from an archaeological pint of view."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Spawls (13 September 2018). "[https://www.lrb.co.uk/v40/n17/alice-spawls/at-norwich-castle-museum At Norwich Castle Museum]." Retrieved October 20th, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; It is now on display, with the [[strombus]] shell in an enamelled mount, as part of the Norwich Castle Museum Collection.

The importance of ''The Paston Treasure'' lies in the international scope and interest of the objects portrayed, reflecting both exotic nature and the skills of man. It is the subject of an exhibition in 2018 in which [[Norwich Castle Museum]] in partnership with the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in the USA, reunite, for the first time in 350 years, as many as possible of the objects depicted in the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastangliaartfund.org.uk/exhibitions/the-paston-treasure-microcosm-of-the-known-world |title=The Paston Treasure, Microcosm of the Known World / East Anglia Art Fund |website=Eastangliaartfund.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://events.stanford.edu/events/581/58105/ |title=Spike Bucklow, U. of Cambridge, "John Donne's Melancholic Portrait" |website=Events.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge''''' ({{lang-fr|La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir}}) is a 1979 book by [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in which Lyotard analyzes the [[epistemology|notion of knowledge]] in [[postmodernity|postmodern]] society as the end of 'grand narratives' or [[metanarrative]]s, which he considers a quintessential feature of [[modernity]]. Lyotard introduced the term 'postmodernism', which was previously only used by art critics, into philosophy and social sciences, with the following observation: "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives".&lt;ref name="Lyotard"&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François (1979). ''La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir''. Paris: Minuit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[[Perry Anderson|Anderson, Perry]] (1998). ''The Origins of Postmodernity''. London/New York: Verso, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from the 1984 (reprint 1997); English translation by [[Geoffrey Bennington]] and [[Brian Massumi]], University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written as a report on the influence of technology in [[exact science]]s, commissioned by the ''Conseil des universités du [[Québec]]'', ''The Postmodern Condition'' was influential.&lt;ref name="Bruneault"&gt;Bruneault, Frédérick (Autumn 2004). "[https://www.ulaval.ca/phares/vol5-automne04/texte03.html Savoir scientifique et légitimation]", ''Revue PHARES'' vol. '''5'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Francois (1979). [http://www.cse.gouv.qc.ca/fichiers/documents/publications/ConseilUniversite/Problemes_savoir_soc_indus_develop-1980.pdf "Les problèmes du savoir dans les sociétés industrielles les plus développées"]. Quebec: Conseil des Universités. Original report available online at: http://www.cse.gouv.qc.ca/FR/Publications_CUniv/&lt;/ref&gt; Lyotard later admitted that he had a "less than limited" knowledge of the science he was to write about, deeming ''The Postmodern Condition'' his worst book.

==Summary==
Lyotard criticizes metanarratives such as [[reductionism]] and [[teleology|teleological]] notions of human history such as those of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Marxism]], arguing that they have become untenable because of [[technology|technological]] progress in the areas of [[communication]], [[mass media]] and [[computer science]]. Techniques such as [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine translation]] show a shift to [[language|linguistic]] and symbolic production as central elements of the [[postindustrial]] economy and the related postmodern culture, which had risen at the end of the 1950s after the reconstruction of [[western Europe]]. The result is a plurality of [[language-game]]s (a term coined by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref name="Lyotard"/&gt;{{rp|67}}), of different types of argument. At the same time, the goal of truth in science is replaced by "performativity" and efficiency in the service of capital or the state, and science produces paradoxical results such as [[chaos theory]], all of which undermine science's grand narrative.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Lyotard professes a preference for this plurality of small narratives that compete with each other, replacing the [[totalitarianism]] of grand narratives.

==Reception==
''The Postmodern Condition'' was influential.&lt;ref name="Bruneault" /&gt; However, Lyotard later admitted that he had a "less than limited" knowledge of the [[science]] he wrote about, and to compensate for this knowledge, he "made stories up" and referred to a number of books that he hadn't actually read. In retrospect, he called it "a [[parody]]" and "simply the worst of all my books".&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Poet [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]] writes that, like many post-structuralist works, ''The Postmodern Condition'' "has not worn well." However, he sees it more readable than other post-structuralist works, and credits Lyotard with covering "a good deal of ground in a lively and economical fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Frederick. ''The Culture of Hope: A New Birth of the Classical Spirit''. The Free Press, 1995, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trinity Square Video''' (TSV) is an artist-run centre in Toronto, Canada. It is known for supporting the production and exhibition of video-based work. It was founded in 1971.

==History==
Trinity Square Video was founded by artists for the purpose of making video equipment easily accessible during the 1970s, a time when basic equipment was prohibitively expensive for independent artists. Artists who have created work at or with the assistance of Trintity Square Video include: [[John Greyson]], [[Lisa Steele]], [[Ed Sinclair]], [[Michael Balser]], [[Kim Tomczak]], [[Vera Frenkel]] and [[Barbara Sternberg]].&lt;ref name="Prefix_Kingstone"&gt;{{cite web|title=When It Comes To Making Art, Peter Kingstone Takes It One A Day|url=http://www.prefix.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2004_Kingstone_PressRelease.pdf|website=Prefix Photo|publisher=Prefix Photo|accessdate=11 January 2018|date=28 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique''''' (also called ''Bathers: Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' and ''Bañistas: dos desnudos en un paisaje exótico'') is an oil painting created circa 1905-06 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956). ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' is a [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] work executed in a highly personal [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] style during the height of the [[Fauvism|Fauve]] period. The painting is now in the [[Carmen Cervera|Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza]] Collection, Spain ([[:es:Colección Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza|Colección Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://coleccioncarmenthyssen.es/artist/jean-metzinger/ Colección Carmen Thyssen‐Bornemisza, Jean Metzinger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://coleccioncarmenthyssen.es/work/baigneuses-deux-nus-dans-un-paysage-exotique/ Colección Carmen Thyssen‐Bornemisza, ''Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Jean Metzinger, c.1906, Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation..jpg|thumb|Jean Metzinger, c.1906, ''[[Femme au Chapeau|Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat)]]'', oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation]]
''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 116 x 88.8&amp;nbsp;cm (45 3/8 by 35 in), signed ''Metzinger'' (lower right). The work—consistent in style with other works by Metzinger created circa 1905-1906, such as ''[[Femme au Chapeau|Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat)]]''—represents two nude women, one seen from the rear and the other from a more frontal position, in a lush, tropical, or subtropical setting. The landscape contains a wide variety of exotic geometrized elements (trees, bushes, flowers, a lake or river, a mountain range and a partly cloudy sky). Metzinger's use of color in ''Two Nudes'' is extremely [[Fauvism|Fauve]]; quasi-pure reds, greens, blues and violets, juxtaposed in groups as if randomly.

While the two nudes are treated with rather natural colors, the rest of the canvas appears treated with more artificial tints, tones, hues and shades. Unlike other Fauve works of the same period by [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] or [[Kees van Dongen]], Metzinger's composition is strongly [[Paul Cézanne|Cézannian]]. The vertical format and light colors of the sky and treatment of foreground and background elements create a flattening of spatial perspective, reminiscent of [[Georges Seurat]], or [[Paul Cézanne]]'s 'multiple viewpoints', his search for order, discipline and permanence. However, the brushstrokes and overall appearance are not at all Cézannian in nature.&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, ''Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

==History==
By 1905 [[Neo-Impressionism]] had witnessed a major resurgence, with recent exhibitions by [[Maximilien Luce]] ([[:fr:Eugène Druet|Galerie Druet]], March 1904), [[Paul Signac]] (Galerie Druet, December 1904), [[Georges Seurat]] ([[Salon des Indépendants]], 1905), [[Henri-Edmond Cross]] (Galerie Druet, March–April 1905). Metzinger's unique style of Neo-Impressionism resulted from the unification of several influences in addition to that of Seurat and Cézanne; that of [[Vincent van Gogh]], with his heavy impasto, dense brushstrokes; and—following posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906—that of [[Paul Gauguin]], with its exotic sumptuousness and sensuality.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; By this time Metzinger had already developed a full-fledged Divisionist facture with large, bold mosaic-like brushwork, beyond that of Cross or Signac.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In statement made circa 1907 regarding his mosaic-like Divisionism—where both size and direction of his cubes of color are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting—Metzinger cites parallels with Neo-Impressionism painters and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] literature:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions aroused by nature." (Metzinger, 1907)&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jean Metzinger"&gt;Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvallières, ''La Grande Revue'', vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This statement seems to relate directly to ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' as well as other works of the same period such as ''[[La danse, Bacchante (Metzinger)|La Danse (Bacchante)]]'', and ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1 (Metzinger)|Coucher de soleil no. 1]]'' (ca.1906)&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt;

:"Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay." Robert Herbert writes: "At the Indépendants in 1905, his paintings were already regarded as in the Neo-Impressionist tradition by contemporary critics, and he apparently continued to paint in large mosaic strokes until some time in 1908. The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of ''[[Coucher de soleil no. 1 (Metzinger)|Coucher de soleil]]'', 1906-1907, Collection Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem.)"&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's Paysage au disque (1906–1907), "is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..." (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo)&lt;ref&gt;[http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524204851/http://kmm.nl/object/KM%20103.080%20RECTO/Landschap |date=2013-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization—just as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on—forming what Metzinger would soon describe as the 'total image'.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bilateral symmetry]] inherent in ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' is striking (even if only as an approximation). The [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] geometry is solidly constructed but the equilibrium is unstable or short-lived. Each tile of pigment juxtaposed one next to the other form a section of the painting: each section of the painting containing between 10 of 50 'tiles' dominated by blues, reds, and greens. There is no smooth transition between each section. The painting is divided, fragmented, splintered or faceted into series, not only of individual rectangles, squares or 'cubes' of color, but into individual planes or surfaces delineated by color and form, already pointing towards Cubism.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann"&gt;[http://jean-metzinger.blogspot.com.es/ Alex Mittelmann, 2012, ''Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

That is not say that ''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' belongs analytic or synthetic Cubism. It does not. The subject is viewed from one point of view, not several. There is no true 'mobile perspective', anymore than in the works of Cézanne or Seurat. But a departure from nature it was, and a departure from all that had been painted to date it was too; a precursor in style, certainly, one that would resurface in the works of Metzinger and others ([[Gino Severini]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Piet Mondrian]]) several years later, within the context of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

''Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape'' signified more that just the incorporation of a radical geometry that would free Metzinger and others from the confines of nature as any artwork executed in Europe to date. This indeed was Neo-Impressionism, Divisionism, albeit in a highly altered form. Beyond the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo-Impressionist color theory, ''Two Nudes'' surpassed the teachings of Cross or Signac. It contained "iridescences", in Metzinger's terms, certain "aspects of color still foreign to painting". It contained a "chromatic versification", as if for syllables. The rhythm of its pictorial phraseology translated the diverse emotions aroused by nature. It no longer represented nature as seen, but was a complete byproduct of the human 'sensation.'&lt;ref name="Mittelmann" /&gt;

Art critic Louis Chassevent, writing about the 1906 Salon des Indépendants, used the word "cube" with reference to Jean Metzinger and [[Robert Delaunay]], two and a half years before similar references would be made by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] to baptize the [[Proto-Cubism|Proto-Cubist]] or [[Cubism|Cubist]] works [[Pablo Picasso]] or [[Georges Braque]]. Recognizing the difference between Metzinger and his contemporaries Louis Chassevent wrote in 1906: 
:"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically." (Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York)&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Chassevent, ''22e Salon des Indépendants'', 1906, ''Quelques petits salons'', Paris, 1908, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year Metzinger and Delaunay shared an exhibition at [[Berthe Weill]]'s gallery (1907). They were singled out by [[Louis Vauxcelles]] as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century]&lt;/ref&gt;

One and a half years later, November 1908, Vauxcelles, in his brief review of Georges Braque's exhibition at Kanhweiler's gallery, called Braque a daring man who despises form, "reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.&lt;ref name="Danchev"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iTzniDD6EwAC&amp;pg=PR123&amp;lpg=PR123&amp;dq=preface,+Exposition+Georges+Braque,+November+1908,+Galerie+Kahnweiler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DZ4-_FKVK0&amp;sig=RjxOvhE7jDIbKCa4h8QkIRsoKnQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sCcxUfLbKa6A0AXIhoGADA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=little%20cubes&amp;f=false Alex Danchev, ''Georges Braques: A Life'', Arcade Publishing, 15 nov. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; '''Lot Notes:'''
The present work is one of a small number of Metzinger compositions fusing a broad, divisionist facture with a fauve palette. This group, which includes the celebrated ''Paysage coloré aux oiseaux exotiques'' (Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), represented the artist's response to the Salon d'Automne of 1905, a review of which saw Louis Vauxcelles coin the term 'Fauve' to describe the circle of artists using bright colour and broad brushstrokes. While on this occasion Metzinger did not exhibit with Matisse, Braque and Vlaminck, since 1904 he had shown alongside these artists who were gaining notoriety as Fauves, notably at the Salons des Indépendants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the departure from the Neo-Impressionist manner of Metzinger's early years, ''Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique'' substitutes the exuberant palette and broader handling of his peers. In both composition and facture though, the work retains a rather more rigorous structure than other Fauve landscapes of the period. It's arcadian subject and a mosaic-like application of paint give a uniquely individual flavour to what Metzinger termed his 'chromatic poetry'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2004/impressionist-modern-art-day-l04003/lot.251.html Sotheby's London, Impressionist &amp; Modern Art, Day Sale, 4 February 2004, Lot 251]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
