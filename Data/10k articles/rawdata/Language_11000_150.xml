'''{{"'}}Good Day, Fellow!' 'Axe Handle!{{'"}}''' (Norwegian: '''"God dag, mann!" "Økseskaft!"''') is a Norwegian folktale, collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen|Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe|Moe]].

==Plot==
A deaf or hard of hearing [[ferry]]man has a wife, two sons and a daughter. They fritter away all their money, and leave him to pay the bill when their credit runs out.

He sees the [[bailiff]] coming in the distance and decides to be clever and prepare his answers ahead of time. He reasons that the first thing the man will ask will be about what he is carving. He will say that it is an axe handle. He thinks that the other questions will be about the length of the axe handle, his ferry, his mare and the way to the cowshed.

However, the first thing the bailiff says is "Good day, fellow!" He replies "Axe handle!", thinking himself clever.

Next the bailiff asks how far it is to the inn. "Up to this knot!" he replies, pointing to the axe handle.

The bailiff shakes his head and stares at him.

"Where is your wife, man?" he says.

"I'm going to tar her," says the ferryman. "She's lying on the beach, cracked at both ends."

"Where is your daughter?"

"Oh, she's in the stable, big with foal," he says, still thinking himself clever.

The bailiff finally gets angry with him and shouts, "Go to the devil, fool that you are!"

"Oh, it's not far away, when you're over the hill, you're almost there," says the man.

==Influence==
The phrase "Goddag mann, økseskaft!" (Good day fellow axe handle) has become a common idiom for a [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]], not just in Norway but also the rest of Scandinavia ("Goddag, yxskaft!" in Swedish, "Goddag mand, økseskaft!" in Danish and "Hyvää päivää, kirvesvartta!" in Finnish).

The folktale was later published in the widely used Swedish elementary school book ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Sörgården|sv}}'' by [[Anna Maria Roos]] in 1912.

A similar tale appears in a 1985 collection of folktales given an erotic twist, by [[Erik Høvring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Høvring|first=Erik|title=Den bortfløjne mødom, samt andre skæmtsomme og erotiske folkeeventyr|year=1985|publisher=Nyt nordisk forlag|location=København|isbn=8717053625|first2=Evald Tang | last2 = Kristensen|others= illustrated by Erik Hjorth Nielsen|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5198">'''ʿAli Akbar Khata'i''' (modern {{lang-tr|Ali Ekber Hıtai}}; ''fl.'' ca. 1500-1516) was an early 16th-century Middle Eastern or Central Asian traveler and writer. Although there is no certainty about his origin, we know that by 1515 he came to (or returned to) [[Istanbul]], where he wrote ''Ḵeṭāy-nāma'', which likely was the first ever book about the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] written on the European continent. His work, originally written in Persian, was later translated into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]], and became influential in the Turkish- and Persian-speaking Muslim world.

As with other Middle Eastern personages, there are a great number of ways to transcribe 'Ali Akbar's name. For example, ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' uses the spelling '''ʿAlī Akbar Ḵeṭāʾī'''.&lt;ref name=ia&gt;T. Yazici, {{iranica|ali-akbar-ketai-9th-10th-15th-16th-cent|ʿAlī Akbar Ḵeṭāʾī}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Nothing much is known for sure about 'Ali Akbar's origin and early life. While he created his book in [[Istanbul]], he may have been born elsewhere in the Islamic World - perhaps, as [[Aly Mazahéri]] suggested, based on textual references, even as far as in [[Transoxania]] ([[Bukhara]]).&lt;ref name=ik&gt;Ralph Kauz, {{iranica|ketay-nama|ʿAlī Akbar Ḵeṭāʾī}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers think that ʿAlī Akbar's name may indicate his [[Shi'ite]] origin. However, his text praises the [[Four Righteous Caliphs]] (venerated by the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]s), so even if born and raised a Shi'ite, he must have changed his religious affiliation due to the changing political situation.&lt;ref name=ik/&gt;

ʿAlī Akbar is thought to have been a merchant by some authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellér-Hann|1995|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to himself as a ''[[Qalandariyya|qalandar]]'' ([[dervish]]) a few times in his book; however, this may be just a figurative expression, emphasizing his humbleness, rather than a literal description of a membership in a [[dervish order]].&lt;ref name=ik/&gt;

The epithet "Khata'i" in ʿAli Akbar's name means "of China", presumably referring to him having traveled to and lived in China. 
While it is usually thought that at least some of the material in ''Khataynameh'' is based on the author's first hand experiences in China, at least one scholar of ''Khataynameh'' - [[Lin Yih-Min]], who translated the book into [[modern Turkish]] - believes that ʿAlī Akbar (much like [[Juan González de Mendoza]] and perhaps [[Marco Polo]]) did not actually travel to China, and his work is thus completely based on others' reports.&lt;ref name=ik/&gt;

==The ''Khataynameh''==
ʿAlī Akbar's ''Khataynameh'' ("The Book of China"), written in [[Persian language|Persian]], was completed in 1516 in Istanbul, and issued{{clarify|date=December 2012}} in 1520.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Kauz, [http://www.silkroadfoundation.org/newsletter/vol3num1/8_khataynameh.php One of the Last Documents of the Silk Road: The Khataynameh of Ali Akbar]&lt;/ref&gt;

ʿAlī Akbar's work, also known as ''Kanun-name'',  was translated into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] in 1582.  His work was used by later Turkish authors; in particular, it was one of the main sources of information on China used by [[Katip Çelebi]] in his ''Jihān-numā'', along with an earlier work by a [[Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh]]. As modern researchers note, Ghiyāth al-dīn's and 'Ali Akbar's accounts, in a way, complemented each other, as the two authors saw [[Ming China]] from different aspects: Ghiyāth al-dīn came to the court of the Ming [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] Emperor as a member of an official delegation from the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ruler [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]], and much of his report is focused on court and diplomatic events; on the other hand, 'Ali Akbar, who, as [[Ildikó Bellér-Hann]] surmises, may have been a merchant, gives a much better view of the country's everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bellér-Hann|2005|pp=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern study and translations==
Three chapters of the ''Khataynameh'' were translated into French by [[Charles Schefer]] and published in 1883, along with the Persian original.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Schefer|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemistry, the [[affix|suffix]] '''-yne''' is used to denote the presence of a [[triple bond]].

The suffix follows [[Chemical nomenclature|IUPAC nomenclature]], and is mainly used in organic chemistry.  However, inorganic compounds featuring unsaturation in the form of triple bonds may be denoted by substitutive nomenclature with the same methods used with alkynes, i.e., the name of the
corresponding saturated hydride is modified by replacing the "-ane" ending with "-yne". "-diyne" is used when there are two triple bonds, and so on. The position of unsaturation is indicated by a numerical locant immediately preceding the "-yne" suffix, or 'locants' in the case of multiple triple bonds. Locants are chosen to be as low as possible. "-yne" is also used as an infix to name substituent groups that are triply bound to the parent compound.

This suffix arose as a collapsed form of the end of the word "[[acetylene]]". The final "-e" disappears if it is followed by another suffix that starts with a vowel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=The Commission on the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry |title=Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry |origyear= 1958 (A: Hydrocarbons, and B: Fundamental Heterocyclic Systems), 1965 (C: Characteristic Groups) |year=1971 |edition=3rd |publisher=Butterworths |location=London |isbn= 0-408-70144-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{New Testament Apocrypha}}
Written in Syriac in the late seventh century, the '''''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius''''' shaped and influenced [[Christian eschatology|Christian eschatological]] thinking in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Mosque"&gt;Griffith (2008), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debié"&gt;Debié (2005) p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;Alexander (1985) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;Jackson (2001) p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; Falsely attributed to [[Methodius of Olympus]],&lt;ref name="Alexander II"&gt;Alexander (1985) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; a fourth century Church Father, the work attempts to make sense of the [[Muslim Conquests|Islamic Conquest]] of the Mediterranean world.&lt;ref name=Ballard&gt;Ballard (2011) p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''Apocalypse'' is noted for incorporating numerous aspects of Christian eschatology such as the invasion of [[Gog and Magog]], the rise of the [[Antichrist]], and the [[tribulations]] that precede the end of the world.

The ''Apocalypse'', however, adds a new element to Christian eschatology: the rise of a messianic Roman emperor.  This element would remain in Christian apocalyptic literature until the end of the [[medieval period]].  Translations into Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Arabic, and other languages from the early eighth century onwards would facilitate the ''Apocalypse''’s influence.&lt;ref name="Jackson II"&gt;Jackson (2001) pp. 347, 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Text==

===Authorship, Location, and Translations===
The ''Apocalypse'' is attributed to Methodius of Olympus in the Syriac text,&lt;ref name=Ballard /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Mosque II"&gt;Griffith (2008) p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;   of Patara in the Greek, both of whom lived in the fourth century.&lt;ref name=Louth&gt;Louth (2010) p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;   In all likelihood, however, the text was written in the seventh century by an unnamed Christian cleric, hence the moniker of Pseudo-Methodius, who was most likely of the [[Jacob Baradaeus|Jacobite]], [[Chalcedonian]], or [[Melkite]] branch of Christianity.&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Mosque" /&gt;   Scholars have argued that the work was written as a contemporary to the Arab Conquests in response to the hardships faced by Christians and widespread apostasy to avoid taxations.  As well, the author sees the invasion occurring as punishment from God.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ballard /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mosque 32"&gt;Griffith (2008) p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muslim Rule 201"&gt;Griffith (2010) p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guenther 371"&gt;Guenther (2007) p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;   The text, therefore, employs historiography, geography, and apocalyptic prophecy.

The text was originally written in Syriac in Northern Syria.&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Mosque" /&gt;   Early scholarship, however, lacked the original Syrian text, and so relied heavily on Greek, Latin, and Slavonic texts for study.  In 1897, the scholar V. Istrin relied heavily on the Greek text and at the same time, and independently, Sackur studied the oldest Latin translations.  Both of these studies ushered in the scholarly study of the ''Apocalypse'', but it was not until 1931 that the original Syriac manuscript was discovered.  With this find, Michael Kmosko was able to ascertain that original ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' to have been written in the Syriac language.&lt;ref name="Alexander II" /&gt;

===Content===
The manuscript begins with a history of the world, starting with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, through to the Muslim conquests, and into the end-times. One notable feature about the work is the presence of sexuality with regards to Christian behavior in the end days—specifically discussing swinging, homosexuality, and cross-dressing as indicators of a sinful society.&lt;ref&gt;Garstad (2012), p. 39 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only then that the text says the “sons of [[Ishmael#Islam|Ishmael]]”, that is Muslims, will emerge from the desert of [[Medina|Ethribus]] to inflict God’s punishment upon the Christians who “slipped into depravity”.  The ''Apocalypse'' also recounts the events that took place at the hands of Muslims in the previous decades.&lt;ref name="Ballard 52"&gt;Ballard (2011) p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;   In invoking figures in other Christian eschatological literature, such as Gog and Magog, Pseudo-Methodius attempts to legitimize his place as a fourth century Church Father.&lt;ref name="Jackson 353"&gt;Jackson (2001) p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript also notes the rise of an Emperor-Saviour figure, echoing the fourth century AD prophecy contributed to the legendary [[Tiburtine Sibyl]].&lt;ref name="Alexander 231"&gt;Alexander (1985) p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;  This Roman emperor will save the Christian lands from “the sons of Ishmael”, place his crown upon the cross “for the sake of the common salvation of all” thereby saving Christendom as a whole.&lt;ref name="Debié 65"&gt;Debié (2005) p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;   The work is notable for its vivid description and brutality.  Descriptions of drinking the blood of cattle,&lt;ref name="Garstad 15"&gt;Garstad (2012) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  stabbing pregnant women, and feeding babies to animals&lt;ref name="Garstad 47"&gt;Garstad (2012) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  permeate throughout the author’s work.

Ballard notes, however, that Pseudo-Methodius deviates from previous eschatological literature, such as [[Book of Revelation|''Revelation'']], in that the ''Apocalypse'' utilizes Roman emperors as agents of change.&lt;ref name="Ballard 52" /&gt;   For this reason, Griffith notes, the ''Apocalypse'' marks the end of the antique era and the dawn of the Middle Ages.{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}}&lt;ref name="Muslim Rule 201" /&gt;   Guenther also notes that Pseudo-Methodius was influenced by the books ''Revelation'' and [[Book of Daniel|''Daniel'']], maintaining the lineage of Christian literature.&lt;ref name="Guenther 371" /&gt;   This is an important feature as it shows the author was most likely a Christian cleric and was familiar with past Christian writings.  By introducing new features into Christian literature while keeping core Christian beliefs and teachings intact helped to make the ''Apocalypse'' accessible to the laity, as well.  Part of the ''Apocalypse''’s influence is attributed to its ability to reflect the beliefs of [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] citizens; they are merely acting out foretold events, and mankind is bound with the fate of the empire and the capital.&lt;ref name=Shepard&gt;Shepard (2010) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;   This, again, helped to endear the piece to a widespread Byzantine audience.

==Historical Context==
Rome and [[Sassanid Persia]] [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|had been at war with one another]] for much of the first quarter of the seventh century.  With both empires still feeling the effects of such a long series of battles, an Arab threat took advantage of the weakening empires.  The Persians faced defeat west of the Euphrates in [[Battle of Qadisiyya|Qadisiyya]] in what Griffith calls “the beginning of the demise of both Roman and Persian rule for good”.&lt;ref name="Griffith 23"&gt;Griffith (2008) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;   This demise would continue throughout the 630s and 640s, as the Arabs [[Muslim conquests|conquered much of the Middle East and the Mediterranean world]].  In 635, Damascus fell, Jerusalem and Antioch followed in 637, Edessa in 640, Alexandria in 642, and Seleucia/Ctesiphon in 645.  Three out of the five patriarchates of Roman Christendom were under Arab Muslim rule.&lt;ref name="Griffith 24"&gt;Griffith (2008) p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 674, the [[Ummayad Caliphate|Ummayad]] [[Muawiyah I|Caliph Muawiyah]] launched a [[First Arab Siege of Constantinople|land and sea assault]] on Constantinople.  Within three years he was defeated and turned his attention on the rest of the surviving Roman Empire, namely the Middle East, Greece, and the Balkans.  As Ballard notes, Constantinople was “reduced to a small Christian enclave within an ocean of Islam.”&lt;ref name=Ballard /&gt;

A campaign by the new Muslim rulers was set in place in order to remove any public display of Christian symbolism through building Islamic-styled buildings and issuing coins declaring an Islamic triumph.  The most dramatic of such constructions was the [[Dome of the Rock]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Griffith 200"&gt;Griffith (2010) p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;   The inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock are taken from the Quran and “proclaim the arrival of a powerful empire that was founded on pure monotheist belief.”&lt;ref name=Ballard /&gt;   This, as Ballard and Griffith both note, was in response to Christians believing in the [[trinity]], and their supposed worship of the Virgin Mary and the Saints something that Muslims saw as polytheistic.&lt;ref name=Ballard /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Mosque II" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffith 200"/&gt;

To defend themselves and without any real power or authority, Christians turned to writing.  The hardships Christians faced in a Muslim territory caused a “literary awakening”, and the earliest of these texts were written in Syriac, Greek, and Arabic.&lt;ref name="Muslim Rule 201"/&gt;   Syriac writers in particular reacted to their world in apocalyptic terms – the fall of their Christian empire was continuing with each Muslim conquest and Syriac writers saw these conquests as a punishment from God.  The most well-known of these texts was the ''Apocalypse'' attributed to Pseudo-Methodius.&lt;ref name="Muslim Rule 201"/&gt;

==Translations, Spread, and Influence of the Apocalypse==
The ''Apocalypse'' marks the end of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages because of its style and influence.  The document was frequently copied and readapted in order to fit the cataclysmic events that occurred in a particular area.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;   By the early 8th century, the work was translated into Greek and then Latin and other languages.  The Apocalypse was most likely translated into Latin by Petrus Monachus in Francia.&lt;ref name=Pollard&gt;Pollard (2010) p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;   The spread and influence of the ''Apocalypse'' was so far reaching that during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]] of the  13th century, Russian Christians invoked the work of Pseudo-Methodius in order to explain the onslaught by using the historical and geographical explanations found within the text.  As well, Christians believed Pseudo-Methodius had predicted the Mongols’ arrival because of their lifestyle, dietary habits, and activities.&lt;ref name="Jackson 353" /&gt;   However, Pelle notes the ''Apocalypse'' was not popular in England before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquests]], despite the popularity of other eschatological literature.  Of the almost twenty-four pre-twelfth century Latin manuscripts, only two were in English and none were from before 1075.  With the invasion of England by the Normans, however, one of the earliest English texts to explain the invasion of “heathens” on a Christian land included the ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius''.&lt;ref name="Pelle 325"&gt;Pelle (2009) p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''Apocalypse'' was invoked by Christians throughout the centuries in order to explain the turmoil they faced in their respective time and place.  As well, it shaped Western Christendom’s view of Islam through the Middle Ages because of various re-adaptions and translations.&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Mosque" /&gt;   With the fall of more Christian cities from the fourteenth century onwards, along with [[Fall of Constantinople|Constantinople in 1453]], the ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' was invoked once again.&lt;ref name=Ballard /&gt;

==Modern Context==
Griffith notes, because of questions surrounding the historicity of the ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'', it is easy to dismiss the piece outright.  However, for the historian the ''Apocalypse'' sheds a light on the environment of the age and therefore the literature is still relevant.  Furthermore, the literature is important because of the anonymity of its author.  In a sense, this anonymity lends a sense of “underground literature”.&lt;ref name="Griffith 39"&gt;Griffith (2008) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;   Furthermore, the ''Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius'' allowed the population, regardless of locale, to maintain a “sense of seemingly rightful superiority” despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="Griffith 39"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1973">[[File:Framing hammer.jpg|thumbnail|200px|A hammer could be used as a blunt instrument]]
A '''blunt instrument''' is any solid [[Physical body|object]] used as a [[weapon]], which damages its target by applying direct mechanical force, and has no penetrating point or edge, or is wielded so that the point or edge is not the part of the weapon that inflicts the injury. Blunt instruments may be contrasted with [[edged weapon]]s, which inflict injury by cutting or stabbing, or [[projectile weapons]], where the projectiles, such as [[bullet]]s or [[arrow]]s, are accelerated to a damaging speed.

Blunt instruments typically inflict [[blunt force trauma]], causing bruising, fractures and other internal bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1680107|Forensic Autopsy of Blunt Force Trauma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the parts of the body attacked, [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s may be ruptured or otherwise damaged. Attacks with a blunt instrument may be fatal.

Some sorts of blunt instruments are very readily available, and often figure in [[crime]] cases.  Examples of blunt instruments include:

* Personal implements such as [[walking stick]]s
* Tools such as [[hammer]]s, [[Crowbar (tool)|wrecking bar]]s, [[pipe wrench]]es, or heftier [[flashlight]]s such as the [[Maglite]] or [[Kel-Lite]].
* Parts of tools, such as [[pickaxe handle]]s
* Sports equipment such as [[cricket bat|cricket]] or [[baseball bat]]s, [[hockey stick]]s, [[pool cue]]s, [[golf club]]s, etc.
* Weapons such as [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]]s, [[bâton français|bâtons français]], [[axe]]s, [[spear]]s (using the haft), or [[gun]]s (see [[firearm as a blunt weapon]])
* Other items, such as [[millwall brick]]s or [[tree]] [[branch]]es

'''Chakravarti Rajagopalachari''' (10 December 1878 – 25 December 1972) informally called '''Rajaji''' or '''C.R.''', was an Indian politician, [[Indian independence activist|independence activist]], lawyer, writer, historian and statesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/b7BmRSyqrO8LaTmz1yIv5L/C-Rajagopalachari-The-icon-India-needs-today.html|title=C.

Furthermore, he was the first Indian-born governor-general, since before him the posts were held by British nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/702415/how-rajendra-prasad-and-not-rajaji-became-indias-first-president|title=How Rajendra Prasad (and not Rajaji) became India’s first president|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130082035/http://scroll.in/article/702415/how-rajendra-prasad-and-not-rajaji-became-indias-first-president|archivedate=30 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as leader of the [[Indian National Congress]], [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu#Madras Presidency|Premier of the Madras Presidency]], [[Governor of West Bengal]], Minister for Home Affairs of the Indian Union and [[Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu#Madras State|Chief Minister of Madras state]].  Rajagopalachari founded the [[Swatantra Party]] and was one of the first recipients of India's highest civilian award, the [[Bharat Ratna]]. He vehemently opposed the use of nuclear weapons and was a proponent of world peace and disarmament. During his lifetime, he also acquired the nickname 'Mango of Krishnagiri'.

Rajagopalachari was born in the village of [[Thorapalli]] in the [[Krishnagiri district]] of the [[Madras Presidency]] (now the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu) and educated at [[Bangalore University|Central College]], Bangalore, and [[Presidency College, Madras]]. In 1900 he started a legal practice that in time became prosperous. On entering politics, he became a member and later President of the [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] municipality. He joined the Indian National Congress and participated in the agitations against the [[Rowlatt Act]], joining the [[Non-Cooperation movement]], the [[Vaikom Satyagraha]], and the [[Civil Disobedience]] movement. In 1930, Rajagopalachari risked imprisonment when he led the [[Vedaranyam Salt Satyagraha]] in response to the [[Dandi March]]. In 1937, Rajagopalachari was elected Premier of the Madras Presidency and served until 1940, when he resigned due to Britain's declaration of war on Germany. He later advocated co-operation over Britain's war effort and opposed the [[Quit India Movement]]. He favoured talks with both [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and proposed what later came to be known as the ''[[C. R. formula]]''.  In 1946, Rajagopalachari was appointed Minister of Industry, Supply, Education and Finance in the [[Interim Government of India]], and then as the [[Governor of West Bengal]] from 1947 to 1948, Governor-General of India from 1948 to 1950, [[Home Minister of India|Union Home Minister]] from 1951 to 1952 and as [[List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu|Chief Minister of Madras state]] from 1952 to 1954. In 1959, he resigned from the Indian National Congress and founded the Swatantra Party, which fought against the Congress in the [[Indian general election, 1962|1962]], [[Indian general election, 1967|1967]] and [[Indian general election, 1971|1971]] elections. Rajagopalachari was instrumental in setting up a united Anti-Congress front in Madras state under [[C. N. Annadurai]], which swept the 1967 elections. He died on 25 December 1972 at age 94.

Rajagopalachari was an accomplished writer who made lasting contributions to [[Indian English literature]] and is also credited with composition of the song ''[[Kurai Onrum Illai]]'' set to [[Carnatic music]]. He pioneered [[temperance movement|temperance]] and [[Temple Entry Proclamation|temple entry movements]] in India and advocated [[Dalit]] upliftment. He has been criticised for introducing the compulsory study of [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and the controversial [[Kula Kalvi Thittam|Madras Scheme of Elementary Education]] in [[Madras State]]. Critics have often attributed his pre-eminence in politics to his standing as a favourite of both [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Rajagopalachari was described by Gandhi as the "keeper of my conscience".

In the early 1930s, Rajagopalachari emerged as one of the major leaders of the [[Tamil Nadu]] Congress. When Gandhi organised the Dandi march in 1930, Rajagopalachari [[Vedaranyam March|broke the salt laws at Vedaranyam]], near [[Nagapattinam]], along with Indian independence activist [[Sardar Vedaratnam]] and was afterwards imprisoned by the [[British Raj|British]].&lt;ref name="famousindiansp42" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt; He was subsequently elected President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee.&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt; Following enactment of the Government of India Act in 1935, Rajagopalachari was instrumental in getting the Indian National Congress to participate in the 1937 general elections.&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt;

The Indian National Congress first came to power in the [[Madras Presidency]] (also called Madras Province by the British), following the [[Madras legislative assembly election, 1937|Madras elections of 1937]]. Except for a six-year period when Madras was under the governor's direct rule, the Congress administered the presidency until India became independent on 15 August 1947.&lt;ref name="encyclopediapoliticalpartiesp199"&gt;[[#Encycylopedia of Political Parties|Encyclopedia of Political Parties]], p 199&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 59, Rajagopalachari won the Madras University seat and entered the Assembly as the first Premier of the Madras Presidency from the Congress party.

Rajagopalachari issued the Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act 1939, under which restrictions were removed on Dalits and [[Shanars]] entering Hindu temples.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="casteinindianpoliticsp116"&gt;[[#Kothari|Kothari]], p 116&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[Meenakshi Amman temple|Meenakshi temple at Madurai]] was also opened to the Dalits and Shanars. In March 1938 Rajagopalachari introduced the Agricultural Debt Relief Act, to ease the burden of debt on the province's peasant population.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb" /&gt;

He also introduced [[prohibition]],&lt;ref name="oxforddnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rajajiroleinfreedommovementp149"&gt;[[#Bakshi|Bakshi]], p 149&lt;/ref&gt; along with a sales tax to compensate for the loss of government revenue that resulted from the ban on alcohol.&lt;ref name="rajaji_genius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeindia.org/biographies/greatleaders/rajaji/page11.htm|title=Rajaji, An Extraordinary Genius|publisher=freeindia.org|accessdate=15 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517073248/http://www.freeindia.org/biographies/greatleaders/rajaji/page11.htm|archivedate=17 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the revenue decline resulting from prohibition, the Provincial Government shut down hundreds of government-run primary schools,&lt;ref name="periyar_bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evrperiyar-bdu.org/biography.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614223845/http://www.evrperiyar-bdu.org/biography.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 June 2007|title=Biography of E.

Rajagopalachari's tenure as Chief Minister of Madras is largely remembered for the compulsory introduction of Hindi in educational institutions, which made him highly unpopular.&lt;ref name="hindi_imposition"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kumar | first=P.

Some months after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Rajagopalachari resigned as premier along with other members of his cabinet in protest at the declaration of war by the [[Viceroy of India]]. Rajagopalachari was arrested in December 1940, in accordance with the Defence of India rules, and sentenced to one-year in prison.&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt; However, subsequently, Rajagopalachari differed in opposition to the British war effort.&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt; He also opposed the [[Quit India Movement]] and instead advocated dialogue with the British.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|title=C.

Kamaraj]].&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt;

Following the end of the war in 1945, elections followed in the Madras Presidency in 1946. During the last years of the war, Kamaraj was requested by Nehru, PM; Sardar Vallabbhai Patel, Home Minister; and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to make Rajaji the Premier of Madras Presidency. Kamaraj, President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, was forced to make [Tanguturi Prakasam] as Chief Ministerial candidate, by the elected members, to prevent Rajagopalachari from winning. However, Rajagopalachari did not contest the elections, and Prakasam was elected.

Rajaji was instrumental in initiating negotiations between Gandhi and Jinnah.&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt; In 1944, he proposed a solution to the Indian Constitutional tangle.&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt; In the same year, he proposed an "absolute majority" threshold of 55 per cent when deciding whether a district should become part of India or Pakistan,&lt;ref name="spoilsofpartitionp41"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spoils of Partition: Bengal and India, 1947–1967|first=Joya|last=Chaterji|page=41|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-521-87536-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; triggering a huge controversy among nationalists.&lt;ref name="spoilsofpartitionp41" /&gt;

From 1946 to 1947, Rajagopalachari served as the Minister for Industry, Supply, Education and Finance in the Interim Government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru.&lt;ref name="pillarsp88" /&gt;

== Governor of West Bengal 1947–1948 ==
When India and Pakistan attained independence on 15 August 1947, the British province of Bengal was partitioned into two, with [[West Bengal]] becoming part of India and [[East Bengal]] part of Pakistan. Supported by Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajagopalachari was appointed first [[Governor of West Bengal]].&lt;ref name="ghosep331"&gt;[[#Ghose|Ghose]], p 331&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I see that you are not able to restrain the policy of agitation over inter-provincial boundaries.

Must we hasten to create further fissiparous forces?"&lt;ref name="guha_telegraph" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Despite the general attitude of the Bengalis, Rajagopalachari was highly regarded and respected by Chief Minister [[Prafulla Chandra Ghosh]] and the state cabinet.&lt;ref name="spoilsofpartitionp41"/&gt;

From 10 until 24 November 1947, Rajagopalachari served as Acting [[Governor-General of India]] in the absence of the Governor-General [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]], who was on leave in England to attend the marriage of [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] to Mountbatten's nephew [[Prince Philip]].&lt;ref name="profilesincouragep50"&gt;{{cite book|title=Profiles in courage: dissent on Indian socialism|page=50|first=Parth|last=Shah|publisher=Centre for Civil Society|year=2001|isbn=81-87984-01-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajagopalachari led a very simple life in the viceregal palace, washing his own clothes and polishing his own shoes.&lt;ref name="crkesavanp36"&gt;[[#Kesavan|Kesavan]], p 36&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with his abilities, Mountbatten made Rajagopalachari his second choice to succeed him after [[Vallabhbhai Patel]], when he was to leave India in June 1948.&lt;ref name="indiansummerp276"&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian summer: the secret history of the end of an empire|page=276|first=Alex|last=Von Tunzelmann|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-8050-8073-2 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajagopalachari was eventually chosen as the governor-general when Nehru disagreed with Mountbatten's first choice, as did Patel himself.&lt;ref name="indiansummerp276" /&gt; He was initially hesitant but accepted when Nehru wrote to him, "I hope you will not disappoint us.

== In Nehru's Cabinet ==
At Nehru's invitation, in 1950 Rajagopalachari joined the Union Cabinet as Minister without Portfolio&lt;ref name="ghosep331" /&gt; where he served as a buffer between Nehru and Home Minister [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel|Sardar Patel]] and on occasion offered to mediate between the two.&lt;ref name="ghosep331" /&gt; Following Patel's death on 15 December 1950, Rajagopalachari was finally made [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Home Affairs Minister]] and went on to serve for nearly 10 months.&lt;ref name="ghosep331" /&gt; As had his predecessor, he warned Nehru about the expansionist designs of China and expressed regret over the [[Tibet]] problem.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} He also expressed concern over demands for new linguistically based states, arguing that they would generate differences amongst the people.

By the end of 1951, the differences between Nehru and Rajagopalachari came to the fore.&lt;ref name="ghosep331" /&gt; While Nehru perceived the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] to be the greatest threat to the nascent republic, Rajagopalachari held the opinion that the [[Communist Party of India|Communists]] posed the greatest danger.&lt;ref name="ghosep331" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nehrup185"&gt;[[#Zachariah|Zachariah]], p 185&lt;/ref&gt; He also adamantly opposed Nehru's decision to commute the death sentences passed on those involved in the [[Telangana uprising]] and his strong pro-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leanings.&lt;ref name="nehrup185" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nehrup186"&gt;[[#Zachariah|Zachariah]], p 186&lt;/ref&gt; Tired of being persistently over-ruled by Nehru with regard to critical decisions,&lt;ref name="ghosep331" /&gt; Rajagopalachari submitted his resignation on the "grounds of ill-health" and returned to Madras.&lt;ref name="ghosep332"&gt;[[#Ghose|Ghose]], p 332&lt;/ref&gt;

Cariappa]] and the Maharaja of Patiala joined the effort.&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp72" /&gt; Rajagopalachari, Masani and Ranga also tried but failed to involve [[Jayaprakash Narayan]] in the initiative.&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp78"&gt;[[#Erdman|Erdman]], p 78&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short essay "Our Democracy", Rajagopalachari explained the necessity for a right-wing alternative to the Congress by saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;since... the Congress Party has swung to the Left, what is wanted is not an ultra or outer-Left [viz. the CPI or the Praja Socialist Party, PSP], but a strong and articulate Right&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp74" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Rajagopalachari also insisted that the opposition must:
&lt;blockquote&gt;operate not privately and behind the closed doors of the party meeting, but openly and periodically through the electorate.&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp74" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He outlined the goals of the Swatantra Party through twenty one "fundamental principles" in the foundation document.&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp188"&gt;[[#Erdman|Erdman]], p 188&lt;/ref&gt; The party stood for equality and opposed government control over the private sector.&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp189"&gt;[[#Erdman|Erdman]], p 189&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp190"&gt;[[#Erdman|Erdman]], p 190&lt;/ref&gt; Rajagopalachari sharply criticised the bureaucracy and coined the term "[[Licence Raj|licence-permit Raj]]" to describe Nehru's elaborate system of permissions and licences required for an individual to set up a private enterprise. Rajagopalachari's personality became a rallying point for the party.&lt;ref name="swatantraconservatismp74" /&gt;

Rajagopalachari's efforts to build an anti-Congress front led to a patch up with his former adversary [[C. N. Annadurai]] of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]].&lt;ref name="wisestman_thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=The wisest man in India|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2002/12/22/stories/2002122200650300.htm|first=Ramachandra|last=Guha|authorlink=Ramachandra Guha|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=22 December 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208005403/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2002/12/22/stories/2002122200650300.htm|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Annadurai grew close to Rajagopalachari and sought an alliance with the Swatantra Party for the [[Madras State legislative assembly election, 1962|1962 Madras legislative assembly elections]]. Although there were occasional electoral pacts between the Swatantra Party and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Rajagopalachari remained non-committal on a formal tie-up with the DMK due to its existing alliance with Communists whom he dreaded.&lt;ref name="socialchangep111"&gt;{{cite book|title=Social change in modern India|page=111|first=Mysore Narasimhachar|last=Srinivas|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=1995|isbn=812500422X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swatantra Party contested 94 seats in the Madras state assembly elections and won six&lt;ref name="1962electionresults"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/SE_1962/StatRep_Madras_1962.pdf|format=PDF|title=Statistical Report on General Election 1962 to the Legislative Assembly of Madras|publisher=Election Commission of India|accessdate=15 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007003737/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/SE_1962/StatRep_Madras_1962.pdf|archivedate=7 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as won 18 parliamentary seats in the [[Indian general election, 1962|1962 Lok Sabha elections]].&lt;ref name="1962elections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistical Report on General Elections 1962 to the Second Lok Sabha|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1962/Vol_I_LS_62.pdf|publisher=Election Commission of India|accessdate=15 August 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008202517/http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/LS_1962/Vol_I_LS_62.pdf|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1965 Anti-Hindi agitations in Madras ==
{{Main|Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu}}

On 26 January 1950, the Government of India adopted [[Hindi language|Hindi]] as the official language of the country, but because of objections in non-Hindi-speaking areas, it introduced a provision tentatively making English the second official language on a par with Hindi for a stipulated fifteen-year period to facilitate a switch to Hindi in non-Hindi speaking states. From 26 January 1965 onwards, Hindi was to become the sole official language of the Indian Union and people in non-Hindi speaking regions were compelled to learn Hindi. This led to vehement opposition and just before Republic Day, severe [[Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu|anti-Hindi protests]] broke out in Madras State. Rajagopalachari had earlier been sharply critical of the recommendations made by the Official Languages Commission in 1957.&lt;ref name="ghosep218"&gt;[[#Ghose|Ghose]], p 218&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 1956, Rajagopalachari signed a resolution along with Annadurai and Periyar endorsing the continuation of English as the official language.&lt;ref name="aanli"&gt;{{cite book | year=1958| title= Modern India rejects Hindi| publisher=Association for the Advancement of the National Languages of India| page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an All-India Language Conference held on 8 March 1958, he declared: "Hindi is as much foreign to non-Hindi speaking people as English [is] to the protagonists of Hindi".&lt;ref name="languageconflictp192"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language conflict and national development: group politics and national language policy in India|year=1970|page=192|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-01590-8 |first=Jyotindra|last=Dasgupta}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Anti-Hindi agitations broke out in 1965, Rajagopalachari completely reversed his 1938 support for the introduction of Hindi and took a strongly anti-Hindi stand in support of the protests,&lt;ref name="indiatoday"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tongue tied|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;issueid=32&amp;task=view&amp;id=2692&amp;acc=high|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218000710/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;issueid=32&amp;task=view&amp;id=2692&amp;acc=high|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 February 2013|first=A.

The Swatantra party also did well in elections in other states and to the Lok Sabha, the directly elected [[lower house]] of the [[Parliament of India]]. It won 45 Lok Sabha seats in the 1967 general elections and emerged as the single largest opposition party. The principal opposition party in the states of [[Rajasthan]] and [[Gujarat]], it also formed a [[coalition government]] in [[Odisha]] and had a significant presence in [[Andhra Pradesh]], Tamil Nadu and [[Bihar]].

== Later years and death ==
In 1971, Annadurai's successor [[M.

He is also remembered for his literary contributions, some of which are considered modern-day classics. He frequently wrote articles for ''[[Kalki (magazine)|Kalki]]'' and his own journal [[Swarajya (magazine)|Swarajya]], of which [[Philip Spratt]] was editor.

== Criticism ==
Rajagopalachari was considered one of the most able statesmen in the national arena. Critics opine that he completely failed to gauge the thoughts and feelings of the masses – his introduction of Hindi&lt;ref name="passionsofthetongue_brahmandevotee" /&gt; and the Madras Scheme of Elementary Education have both been extensively criticised while his pacifist stance during the Quit India Movement and his "[[C. R. formula]]" angered the majority of his colleagues in the Indian National Congress.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gandhiandrajaji_thehindu" /&gt; [[P. C. Alexander]], a former governor of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, once wrote:

{{quote|The most conspicuous case of constitutional impropriety by the Governor in the exercise of discretion to choose the Chief Minister, took place in 1952 when the then Governor of Madras, Sri Prakasa, invited Rajagopalachari to form the government in the composite State&lt;ref name="governorsandcms_thehindu" /&gt;}}

Although his popularity at the regional level fluctuated greatly, it is believed that{{who|date=June 2011}} Rajagopalachari was able to exercise his stranglehold over provincial politics mainly because he was favoured by national leaders such as Gandhi, Patel and Nehru.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb" /&gt; Critics feel that when the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee K. Kamaraj and a majority of the provincial leaders turned against him in the 1940s, Rajagopalachari clung on to a position of influence in regional politics through support from his colleagues at the centre.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb" /&gt;

Rajagopalachari was portrayed as an "archetypal" [[Tamil Brahmin]] [[Archenemy|"nemesis"]] of the [[anti-Brahmin]] [[bigotry|demagogues]] constituting the self-proclaimed [[Self-Respect Movement|"Dravidian movement"]].&lt;ref name="oxforddnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="passionsofthetongue_brahmandevotee" /&gt; A deeply religious, pious Hindu and follower of the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]],{{citation needed|reason=Source needed if not given already|date=September 2017}} he was "accused" of being "pro-Sanskrit" and "pro-Hindi", positions that had in fact long been the consensus among other Dravidian-language speaking States in India who far exceeded Tamil speakers by population. Rajagopalachari found this "stigma" difficult to erase despite his vehement protests against the "imposition" of Hindi during the Madras [[Anti-Hindi agitations]] of 1965.&lt;ref name="passionsofthetongue_brahmandevotee" /&gt; He was also "accused" of attempting to heavily "Sanskritise" Tamil vocabulary through the inclusion of a large number of Sanskrit-derived words in his writings.&lt;ref name="passionsofthetongue_brahmandevotee" /&gt;

In the [[United States]] [[cable television]] industry, a '''cable television franchise fee''' is an annual fee charged by a local government to a private cable television company as compensation for using [[public property]] it owns as [[easement|right-of-way]] for its cable.&lt;ref name="Linder"&gt;{{cite book

The franchise fee is set during initial negotiation of the franchise agreement, usually by a process in which the government requests bids from cable providers to serve their community.  It can be renegotiated when the franchise agreement comes up for renewal, usually at intervals of 10 to 12 years.    Although it is paid to a government, it is not a tax.

Franchise fees are governed under Section 622 of the [[Cable Communications Act of 1984]].&lt;ref name=CCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 622 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cable_Communications_Policy_Act_of_1984#.60.60FRANCHISE_FEES |work=Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 |accessdate=30 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FVXBV3fo?url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Cable_Communications_Policy_Act_of_1984 |archivedate=30 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 622, states that municipalities are entitled to a maximum of 5% of gross [[revenue]]s derived from the operation of the cable system for the provision of cable services such as [[Public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) TV channels.

==Controversy==
Section 542(f) of the Communications Act says "A cable operator may designate that portion of a subscriber's bill attributable to the franchise fee as a separate item on the bill."&lt;ref name="Linder" /&gt;  Most cable providers choose to list this item on customer's bills, so every customer will see it each time they pay their bill.  This has become a source of contention and controversy, since how franchise fees are characterized and billed can have a profound effect on public attitudes toward cable television.

Local governments generally would prefer this item not be listed on the bill.&lt;ref name="Linder" /&gt;  Since the fee is paid to the government, when it is broken down on a per-customer basis on the bill it appears to be a tax on the customer, possibly igniting antipathy against government officials.&lt;ref name="Linder" /&gt;  If it just appeared on accounting statements as a lump sum payment by the cable provider, it would be perceived by the public more as a fee-for-service,&lt;ref name="Linder" /&gt; which is how governments regard it.  However, the Communications Act provides the transparency of the franchise fee so that customers of the cable company understand the fee imposed by the government upon the cable company.

Cable providers, in contrast, see the fee as a cost of doing business which they are passing along to the customer.&lt;ref name="Linder" /&gt;  By listing on their bill the portion attributable to the fee, customers may feel that government is responsible for that portion, not the cable provider.  Also, since customers will immediately notice any increase in the fee, and may interpret it as a "tax increase", listing it on the bill may discourage governments from pushing for an increase in the fee when the franchise agreement is renewed.

Justifications or rationales for the franchise fee fall into six basic categories:&lt;ref name="Linder" /&gt; 
*''Revenue'' - a source of general revenue for the government which can be raised without raising taxes.
*''Rent'' - rent for the use of public land as right-of-way by the company for its cables.
*''Exclusivity'' - compensation to the government for allowing the cable operator to maintain a de facto monopoly on cable service in the area.
*''Diversity'' - it is in the public interest to fund government facilities providing [[public, educational, and government access]] (PEG) channels that promote diversity in the community.  
*''Benefit'' - compensation for the public relations benefits the cable provider gains by having public, educational, and governmental channels on the cable.
*''Regulatory'' - compensation to the government for the cost of regulating cable television: consultants, auditors, administrators, and inspectors.

In [[linguistics]], a '''compound''' is a [[lexeme]] (less precisely, a [[word]]) that consists of more than one [[Word stem|stem]]. '''Compounding''', '''composition''' or '''nominal composition''' is the process of [[word formation]] that creates compound lexemes. That is, in familiar terms, compounding occurs when two or more words are joined to make one longer word. The meaning of the compound may be similar to or different from the meanings of its components in isolation. The component stems of a compound may be of the same part of speech—as in the case of the English word ''footpath'', composed of the two nouns ''foot'' and ''path''—or they may belong to different parts of speech, as in the case of the English word ''blackbird'', composed of the adjective ''black'' and the noun ''bird''.  With very few exceptions, English compound words are stressed on their first component stem.

The process occurs readily in other [[Germanic languages]] for different reasons.  Words can be concatenated both to mean the same as the sum of two words (e.g. ''Pressekonferenz''—German for press conference) or where an adjective and noun are compounded (e.g. ''hvidvinsglas''—Danish for white wine glass).

The addition of [[affix|affix morphemes]] to words (such as [[suffix]]es or [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefixes]], as in ''employ'' → ''employment'') should not be confused with nominal composition, as this is actually [[morphological derivation]].

Some languages easily form compounds from what in other languages would be a multi-word expression. This can result in unusually long words, a phenomenon known in German (which is one such language) as ''Bandwurmwörter'' or ''tapeworm words''.

==Formation of compounds==
Compound formation rules vary widely across language types.

In a [[synthetic language]], the relationship between the elements of a compound may be marked with a case or other morpheme. For example, the [[German language|German]] compound {{lang|de|Kapitänspatent}} consists of the lexemes {{lang|de|Kapitän}} (sea captain) and {{lang|de|Patent}} (license) joined by an ''-s-'' (originally a [[genitive case]] suffix); and similarly, the [[Latin]] lexeme {{lang|la|paterfamilias}} contains the [[Old Latin|archaic]] genitive form {{lang|la|familias}} of the lexeme {{lang|la|familia}} (family). Conversely, in the [[Hebrew language]] compound, the word בֵּית סֵפֶר {{lang|he-Latn|bet sefer}} (school), it is the head that is modified: the compound literally means "house-of book", with בַּיִת {{lang|he-Latn|bayit}} (house) having entered the [[construct state]] to become בֵּית {{lang|he-Latn|bet}} (house-of). This latter pattern is common throughout the [[Semitic languages]], though in some it is combined with an explicit genitive case, so that both parts of the compound are marked (e.g. Arabic عبد الله ''ʕabdu ʔal-lāhi'' "servant-of-God").

[[Agglutinative language]]s tend to create very long words with derivational morphemes. Compounds may or may not require the use of derivational morphemes also.
The longest compounds in the world may be found in the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Germanic languages]]. In [[German language|German]], extremely 
extendable compound words can be found in the language of chemical compounds, where, in the cases of biochemistry and polymers, they can be practically unlimited in length, mostly because the German rule suggests combining all [[noun adjunct]]s with the noun as the very last stem. German examples include {{lang|de|Farbfernsehgerät}} (color television set), {{lang|de|Funkfernbedienung}} (radio remote control), and the often quoted jocular word {{lang|de|Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitänsmütze}} (originally only two Fs, [[Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft|Danube steamboat shipping company]] captain['s] hat), which can of course be made even longer and even more absurd, e.g. ''Donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaftskapitänsmützenreinigungsausschreibungsverordnungsdiskussionsanfang'' ("beginning of the discussion of a regulation on tendering of Danube steamboat shipping company captain hats") etc. According to several editions of the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], the longest published German has 79 letters and is '' [[Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft]] ''("Association for Subordinate Officials of the Main Electric[ity] Maintenance Building of the Danube Steam Shipping"), but there is no evidence that this association ever actually existed. The word is so absurd that it was obviously invented as a joke, which is emphasized by the illogical use of the plural of "electricity".

In Finnish, although there is theoretically no limit to the length of compound words, words consisting of more than three components are rare. Even those with less than three components can look mysterious to non-Finnish such as {{lang|fi|hätäuloskäynti}} (emergency exit). Internet folklore sometimes suggests that {{lang|fi|lentokonesuihkuturbiinimoottoriapumekaanikkoaliupseerioppilas}} (Airplane jet turbine engine auxiliary mechanic non-commissioned officer student) is the longest word in Finnish, but evidence of it actually being used is scant and anecdotal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.finnsnw.org/etc.html|title = Seattle FinnFest '09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds can be rather long when translating technical documents from English to some other language, since the lengths of the words are theoretically unlimited, especially in chemical terminology. For example, when translating an English technical document to Swedish, the term "Motion estimation search range settings" can be directly translated to {{lang|sv|rörelseuppskattningssökintervallsinställningar}}, though in reality, the word would most likely be divided in two: {{lang|sv|sökintervallsinställningar för rörelseuppskattning}} – "search range settings for motion estimation".

==Subclasses==

===Semantic classification===

A common semantic classification of compounds yields four types:

*endocentric
*exocentric
*copulative
*appositional

'''An [[endocentric]] compound''' consists of a ''[[head (linguistics)|head]]'', i.e. the categorical part that contains the basic meaning of the whole compound, and modifiers, which restrict this meaning. For example, the English compound ''doghouse'', where ''house'' is the head and ''dog'' is the modifier, is understood as a house intended for a dog. Endocentric compounds tend to be of the same [[part of speech]] (word class) as their head, as in the case of ''doghouse''. (Such compounds were called ''[[tatpuruṣa]]'' in the Sanskrit tradition.)

An '''[[exocentric]] compound''' (called a ''[[bahuvrihi]]'' compound in the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] tradition) is a [[hyponym]] of some unexpressed semantic category (such as a person, plant, or animal): none (neither) of its components can be perceived as a formal head, and its meaning often cannot be transparently guessed from its constituent parts. For example, the English compound ''white-collar'' is neither a kind of collar nor a white thing. In an exocentric compound, the word class is determined lexically, disregarding the class of the constituents. For example, a ''must-have'' is not a verb but a noun. The meaning of this type of compound can be glossed as "(one) whose B is A", where B is the second element of the compound and A the first. A bahuvrihi compound is one whose nature is expressed by neither of the words: thus a ''white-collar'' person is neither white nor a collar (the collar's colour is a [[metonym]] for socioeconomic status). Other English examples include ''barefoot''.

'''Copulative compounds''' are compounds with two semantic heads.

'''Appositional compounds''' are lexemes that have two (contrary) attributes that classify the compound.

===Syntactic classification===

====Noun–noun compounds====
All natural languages have compound nouns. The positioning of the words (i.e. the most common order of constituents in phrases where nouns are modified by adjectives, by possessors, by other nouns, etc.) varies according to the language. While Germanic languages, for example, are left-branching when it comes to noun phrases (the modifiers come before the head), the Romance languages are usually right-branching.

In [[French language|French]], compound nouns are often formed by left-hand heads with prepositional components inserted before the modifier, as in ''chemin-de-fer'' 'railway', lit. 'road of iron', and ''moulin à vent'' 'windmill', lit. 'mill (that works)-by-means-of wind'.

In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], one way of forming compound nouns is as follows: ''yeldeğirmeni'' 'windmill' (''yel'': wind, ''değirmen-i'': mill-possessive); ''demiryolu'' 'railway' (''demir'': iron, ''yol-u'': road-possessive).

====Verb–noun compounds====
A type of compound that is fairly common in the [[Indo-European languages]] is formed of a verb and its object, and in effect transforms a simple verbal clause into a noun.

In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], for example, such compounds consist of a verb conjugated for the second person singular imperative followed by a noun (singular or plural): e.g., ''rascacielos'' (modelled on "skyscraper", lit. 'scratch skies'), ''sacacorchos'' ('corkscrew', lit. 'pull corks'), ''guardarropa'' ('wardrobe', lit. 'store clothes'). These compounds are formally invariable in the plural (but in many cases they have been reanalyzed as plural forms, and a singular form has appeared). French and Italian have these same compounds with the noun in the singular form: Italian ''grattacielo'', 'skyscraper'; French ''grille-pain'', 'toaster' (lit. 'toast bread').

This construction exists in English, generally with the verb and noun both in uninflected form: examples are ''spoilsport'', ''killjoy'', ''breakfast'', ''cutthroat'', ''pickpocket'', ''dreadnought'', and ''know-nothing''.

Also common in English is another type of verb–noun (or noun–verb) compound, in which an argument of the verb is [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporated]] into the verb, which is then usually turned into a [[gerund]], such as ''breastfeeding'', ''finger-pointing'', etc. The noun is often an instrumental complement. From these gerunds new verbs can be made: ''(a mother) breastfeeds (a child)'' and from them new compounds ''mother-child breastfeeding'', etc.

In the Australian Aboriginal language [[Jingulu language|Jingulu]], a [[Pama–Nyungan language]], it is claimed that all verbs are V+N compounds, such as "do a sleep", or "run a dive", and the language has only three basic verbs: ''do'', ''make'', and ''run''.&lt;ref&gt;Pensalfini, R. (1992) ''Jingulu Grammar, Dictionary and Texts'', pp. 138-139. Unpublished PhD thesis submitted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, May 12, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special kind of compounding is [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], of which noun incorporation into a verbal root (as in English ''backstabbing'', ''breastfeed'', etc.) is most prevalent (see below).

====Verb–verb compounds====
{{Main|Compound verb}}
Verb–verb compounds are sequences of more than one verb acting together to determine clause structure. They have two types:

*In a '''[[Serial verb construction|serial verb]]''', two actions, often sequential, are expressed in a single clause. For example, [[Ewe language|Ewe]] &lt;big&gt;''trɔ dzo''&lt;/big&gt;, lit. "turn leave", means "turn and leave", and [[Hindi]] {{lang|hi|जाकर देखो}} ''jā-kar dekh-o'', lit. "go-&lt;small&gt;CONJUNCTIVE PARTICIPLE&lt;/small&gt; see-&lt;small&gt;IMPERATIVE&lt;/small&gt;", means "go and see". In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], a Dravidian language, van̪t̪u paːr, lit. "come see". In each case, the two verbs together determine the semantics and argument structure.

Serial verb expressions in English may include ''What did you go and do that for?'', or ''He just upped and left''; this is however not quite a true compound since they are connected by a conjunction and the second missing arguments may be taken as a case of [[Elliptical construction|ellipsis]].

*In a '''compound verb''' (or ''complex predicate''), one of the verbs is the primary, and determines the primary semantics and also the argument structure. The secondary verb, often called a vector verb or explicator, provides fine distinctions, usually in temporality or [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and also carries the [[inflection]] (tense and/or agreement markers). The main verb usually appears in conjunctive participial (sometimes ''zero'') form. For examples, [[Hindi]] {{lang|hi|निकल गया}} ''nikal gayā'', lit. "exit went", means 'went out', while निकल पड़ा ''nikal paRā'', lit. "exit fell", means 'departed' or 'was blurted out'. In these examples निकल ''nikal'' is the primary verb, and गया ''gayā'' and पड़ा ''paRā'' are the vector verbs. Similarly, in both English ''start reading'' and Japanese 読み始める ''yomihajimeru'' "read-&lt;small&gt;CONJUNCTIVE&lt;/small&gt;-start" "start reading," the vector verbs ''start'' and 始める ''hajimeru'' "start" change according to tense, negation, and the like, while the main verbs ''reading'' and 読み ''yomi'' "reading" usually remain the same. An exception to this is the passive voice, in which both English and Japanese modify the main verb, i.e. ''start to be read'' and 読まれ始める ''yomarehajimeru'' lit. "read-&lt;small&gt;PASSIVE-(CONJUNCTIVE)&lt;/small&gt;-start" ''start to be read''. With a few exceptions all compound verbs alternate with their simple counterparts. That is, removing the vector does not affect grammaticality at all nor the meaning very much: निकला ''nikalā'' '(He) went out.' In a few languages both components of the compound verb can be finite forms: [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] ''kecc-ar ker-ar'' lit. "died-3pl went-3pl" '(They) died.'
*Compound verbs are very common in some languages, such as the northern [[Indo-Aryan languages]] [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and [[Dravidian languages]] like [[Tamil language|Tamil]], where as many as 20% of verb forms in running text are compound. They exist but are less common in other Indo-Aryan languages like [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Nepali language|Nepali]], in [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] like [[Limbu language|Limbu]] and [[Newar language|Newari]], in [[Turkic languages]] like [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], in [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and in northeast Caucasian languages like [[Tsez language|Tsez]] and [[Avar language|Avar]].
*Under the influence of a [[Kichwa|Quichua]] substrate speakers living in the Ecuadorian [[altiplano]] have innovated compound verbs in Spanish:
:''De rabia '''puso rompiendo''' la olla'', 'In anger (he/she) smashed the pot.' (Lit. from anger '''put breaking''' the pot)
:'' '''Botaremos matándo'''te'' 'We will kill you.' (Cf. Quichua ''huañuchi-shpa shitashun'', lit. kill-&lt;small&gt;CP&lt;/small&gt; throw.1plFut.
:Likewise in Hindi: तेरे को मार डालेंगे ''tere ko mār DāleNge'', lit. "we will kill-throw you").

*Compound verb equivalents in English (examples from the internet):
:''What did you '''go and do''' that for?''
:''If you are not giving away free information on your web site then a huge proportion of your business is just '''upping and leaving'''.''
:''Big Pig, she '''took and built''' herself a house out of brush.''
*Caution: In descriptions of [[Persian language|Persian]] and other [[Iranian languages]] the term 'compound verb' refers to noun-plus-verb compounds, not to the verb–verb compounds discussed here.

====Compound adpositions====
Compound [[preposition]]s formed by prepositions and nouns are common in English and the Romance languages (consider English ''on top of'', Spanish ''encima de'', etc.). Hindi has a small number of simple (i.e., one-word) postpositions and a large number of compound postpositions, mostly consisting of simple postposition ''ke'' followed by a specific postposition (e.g., ''ke pas'', "near"; ''ke nīche'', "underneath").

In English, the head of a compound word is the last morpheme: science ''fiction''. Conversely, the Spanish head is located at the front, so ''ciencia ficción'' sounds like a kind of fictional science rather than scientific fiction.)
*{{lang|es|ciempiés}} 'centipede': {{lang|es|cien}} 'hundred' + {{lang|es|pies}} 'feet'

Tamil:
In ''Cemmozhi'' (Classical Tamil), rules for compounding are laid down in grammars such as [[Tolkappiyam]] and [[Nannūl]], in various forms, under the name ''punarcci''. Examples of compounds include [[Gopuram#Etymology|kopuram]] from 'kō' (king) + '[[puram]]' (exterior). Sometimes phonemes may be inserted during the blending process such as in [[koil|kovil]] from 'kō' (king) + 'il' (home). Other types are like ''vennai'' (butter) from 'veḷḷai' (white) + 'nei' ([[ghee]]); note how 'veḷḷai' becomes 'ven'.

In ''koṭuntamizh'' (Non-standard Tamil), parts of words from other languages may be morphed into Tamil. Common examples include 'ratta-azhuttam' (blood pressure) from the Sanskrit ''rakta'' (blood) and ''Cemmozhi'' 'azhuttam' (pressure); note how ''rakta'' becomes ''ratta'' in Tamil order to remove the consonant-cluster. This also happens with English, for examples ''kāpi-kaṭai'' (coffee shop) is from English ''coffee'', which becomes ''kāpi'' in Tamil, and the Tamil ''kaṭai'' meaning shop.

[[Tlicho language|Tłįchǫ Yatiì]]/Dogrib:
*''dlòotsǫ̀ǫ̀'' 'peanut butter': ''dlòo'' 'squirrel' + ''tsǫ̀ǫ̀'' 'dung'
*''eyakǫ̀'' 'hospital'': ''eya'' 'sick' + ''kǫ̀'' 'house'
*''dè gotłeè'' 'kerosene': ''dè'' 'land' + ''gotłeè'' 'its fat'
*''dǫ łèt'è'' 'bannock': ''dǫ'' '[Aboriginal] people' + ''łèt'è'' 'bread'

=== Germanic languages ===
In [[Germanic languages]] (including [[English language|English]]), compounds are formed by prepending what is effectively a [[namespace]] (disambiguation context) to the main word. For example, "[[football]]" would be a "ball" in the "foot" context. In itself, this does not alter the meaning of the main word. The added context only makes it more precise. As such, a "football" must be understood as a "ball". However, as is the case with "football", a well established compound word may have gained a special meaning in the language's [[vocabulary]]. Only this defines "football" as a particular type of ball (unambiguously the [[Ball|round object]], not the [[Ball_(dance_party)|dance party]], at that), and also the game involving such a ball. Another example of special and altered meaning is "starfish" – a [[starfish]] is in fact not a [[fish]] in modern biology. Also syntactically, the compound word behaves like the main word – the whole compound word (or phrase) inherits the [[word class]] and inflection rules of the main word. That is to say, since "fish" and "shape" are nouns, "starfish" and "star shape" must also be nouns, and they must take plural forms as "starfish" and "star shapes", definite singular forms as "the starfish" and "the star shape", and so on. This principle also holds for languages that express [[definiteness]] by inflection (as in [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]).

Because a compound is understood as a word in its own right, it may in turn be used in new compounds, so forming an arbitrarily long word is trivial. This contrasts to Romance languages, where prepositions are more used to specify word relationships instead of concatenating the words. As a member of the Germanic family of languages, English is unusual in that compounds, as a main rule, are written in their separate parts. This would be an error in at least Norwegian, [[no:Særskriving]] Swedish, [[sv:Särskrivning]] Danish, [[da:Særskrivning]] German[[de:Leerzeichen_in_Komposita]] and Dutch.[[nl:Onjuist_spatiegebruik]] However, this is merely an orthographic convention: As in other Germanic languages, arbitrary [[noun phrases]], for example, like "girl scout troop", "city council member", and "cellar door", can be made up on the spot and used as compound nouns in speech, also in English.

===Russian language===
In the [[Russian language]] compounding is a common type of [[word formation]], and several types of compounds exist, both in terms of compounded parts of speech and of the way of the formation of a compound.&lt;ref&gt;''Student Dictionary of Compound Words of the Russian Language''(1978) {{ISBN|0-8285-5190-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compound nouns may be agglutinative compounds, hyphenated compounds (стол-книга 'folding table' lit. 'table-book', i.e., "book-like table"), or abbreviated compounds ([[acronym]]s: колхоз '[[kolkhoz]]'). Some compounds look like acronym, while in fact they are an agglutinations of type [[stem (linguistics)|stem]] + word: Академгородок '[[Akademgorodok]]' (from ''akademichesky gorodok'' 'academic village'). In agglutinative compound nouns, an agglutinating infix is typically used: пароход 'steamship': пар + о + ход. Compound nouns may be created as noun+noun, adjective + noun, noun + adjective (rare), noun + verb (or, rather, noun + [[verbal noun]]).

Compound adjectives may be formed either per se, e.g., бело-розовый 'white-pink', or as a result of compounding during the derivation of an adjective from a multi-word term: Каменноостровский проспект ({{IPA|[kəmʲɪnnʌʌˈstrovskʲɪj prʌˈspʲɛkt]}}) 'Stone Island Avenue', a street in [[St.Petersburg]].

[[Reduplication in Russian language]] is also a source of compounds.

Quite a few Russian words are borrowed from other languages in an already compounded form, including numerous "[[classical compound]]s" or [[internationalism (linguistics)|internationalisms]]: автомобиль 'automobile'.

===Sanskrit language===
{{Main|Sanskrit compounds}}
Sanskrit is very rich in compound formation with seven major compound types and as many as 55 sub-types.&lt;ref name="scl"&gt;{{cite conference | last=Kumar | first=Anil |author2=Mittal, Vipul |author3=Kulkarni, Amba  | editor=Jha, Girish Nath (ed.) | booktitle=Sanskrit Computational Linguistics: 4th International Symposium, New Delhi, India, December 10–12, 2010: Proceedings (Volume 6465 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science / Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence Series) | title=Sanskrit Compound Processor | year=2010 | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-3-642-17527-5 | pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound formation process is productive, so it is not possible to list all Sanskrit compounds in a dictionary.

On including word boundaries with sandhi (vedānta=veda-anta, rāmāyaṇa=rāma-ayana, bhāgavatādi=bhāgavata-ādi, siddhānta=siddha-anta, samadhikṛtāśeṣa=samadhikṛta-aśeṣa, svādhyāya=sva-adhyāya), this is a compound of 35 words and 86 syllables.

==Recent trends==
Although there is no universally agreed-upon guideline regarding the use of compound words in the [[English language]], in recent decades written English has displayed a noticeable trend towards increased use of compounds.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Recently, many words have been made by taking syllables of words and compounding them, such as pixel (picture element) and bit (binary digit). This is called a [[syllabic abbreviation]].

In Dutch and the [[Scandinavian languages]] there is an unofficial trend toward splitting compound words, known in Norwegian as ''særskriving'', in Swedish as ''särskrivning'' (literally "separate writing"), and in Dutch as ''Engelse ziekte'' (the "English disease"). Because the Scandinavian languages rely heavily on the distinction between the compound word and the sequence of the separate words it consists of, this has serious implications. For example, the adjective ''røykfritt'' (literally "smokefree", meaning no smoking allowed) if separated into its composite parts, would mean ''røyk fritt'' ("smoke freely"). In Dutch, compounds written with spaces may also be confused, but can also be interpreted as a sequence of a noun and a [[genitive]] (which is unmarked in Dutch) in formal abbreviated writing. This may lead to, for example, ''commissie vergadering'' ("commission meeting") being read as "commission of the meeting" rather than "meeting of the commission" (normally spelled ''commissievergadering'').

The [[German spelling reform]] of 1996 introduced the option of [[hyphen]]ating compound nouns when it enhances comprehensibility and readability. This is done mostly with very long compound words by separating them into two or more smaller compounds, like ''Eisenbahn-Unterführung'' (railway underpass) or ''Kraftfahrzeugs-Betriebsanleitung'' (car manual). Such practice is also permitted in other Germanic languages, e.g. Danish and [[Norwegian orthography|Norwegian]] (Bokmål and Nynorsk alike), and is even encouraged between parts of the word that have very different pronunciation, such as when one part is a [[loan word]] or an [[acronym]].

'''Dizin''' (often called “Dizi” or “Maji” in the literature) is an [[Omotic languages|Omotic language]] of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family spoken by the [[Dizi people]], primarily in the [[Maji (woreda)|Maji]] [[woreda]] of the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region]], located in southwestern [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/images/documents/pdf_files/regional/SNNPR1.pdf ''The 1994 Population and Housing census of the SNNPR Region: Volume I, Part I''], Table 2.15. According to Table 2.16, Dizin is second to Amharic in the number of speakers in the woreda's towns of [[Maji, Ethiopia|Maji]], [[Jeba, Ethiopia|Jeba]] and [[Tum, Ethiopia|Tum]].&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 census listed 33,927 speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/images/documents/pdf_files/regional/CountryLevel.pdf Ethiopia 2007 Census]&lt;/ref&gt;  
A population of 17,583 was identified as  monolinguals in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed. 2005. ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''. 15th edition. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language has basic [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] (subject–object–verb) word order, tones, and is largely suffixing. Phonologically, "Features of the Dizin sound system include [[Glottalic consonant|glottalized]] consonants, [[syllabic nasal]]s, [[lengthened vowel]]s, three [[phonemic tone]] levels and [[contour tone]]s. Western Dizin has phonemic retroflex consonants. The glottal stop is analyzed as phonemic word initially before nasals, but not phonemic elsewhere". (Beachy 2005:iv)

Dizin, together with the [[Sheko language|Sheko]] and [[Nayi language|Nayi]] languages, is part of a cluster of languages variously called "Maji" or "Dizoid".

[[Image:Hermes 16 illustration1.png|thumb|The Duenos inscription, as recorded by [[Heinrich Dressel]].]]

The '''Duenos inscription''' is one of the earliest known [[Old Latin]] texts, variously dated from the 7th to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Osvaldo Sacchi, "Il trivaso del Quirinale", in ''Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquité'', 2001, p. 277; citing: Attilio Degrassi, ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Liberae Rei Publicae]]'', 1, 1957; Arthur Gordon, "Notes on the Duenos-Vase Inscription in Berlin", ''California Studies in Classical Antiquity'', Vol. 8, 1975, pp.&amp;nbsp;53–72; Giovanni Colonna, "Duenos", in ''Studi Etruschi'', '''47''', 1979, pp. 163–172; Brent Vine, [http://www.pies.ucla.edu/IESV/1/BV_Duenos.pdf "A Note on the Duenos Inscription"], [[University of California at Los Angeles]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is inscribed on the sides of a ''[[kernos]]'', in this case a trio of small globular vases adjoined by three clay struts. It was found by [[Heinrich Dressel]] in 1880 on the [[Quirinal Hill]] in [[Rome]]. The ''kernos'' belongs to the [[Staatliche Museen]] in [[Berlin]] (inventory no. 30894,3).

The inscription is written [[Right-to-left|right to left]] in three units, without spaces to separate words. It is difficult to translate, as some letters are hard to distinguish, particularly since they cannot always be deduced by context. The absence of spaces causes additional difficulty in assigning the letters to the respective words.

==Text and translations==

There have been many proposed translations advanced by scholars since the discovery of the ''kernos''; by 1983, more than fifty different explanations of the meaning had been put forward.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Gordon, ''Illustrated Introduction to Latin Epigraphy'', 1983, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of a large body of archaic Latin, and the method by which [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] abbreviated their inscriptions, scholars have not been able to produce a singular translation that has been accepted by historians as accurate. However thanks to Arthur E. Gordon's work the reading of the text can be now considered certain.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur E. Gordon, "Note on the Duenos Vase inscription in Berlin", in ''California Studies in Classical Antiquity'', '''8''', 1976, pp. 53 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Contradict-inline|reason=There's no translation considered accurate, but this one person's translation is accepted as certain?|date=April 2018}}

Below is the transcription and one of many possible interpretations:&lt;ref&gt;S. Warmington, 54 ff.; and H. Eichner, in: ''Die Sprache'', 34, 1988-1990, 207 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
:a. The direct [[unicase]] transcription
:b. Direct transcription, in lowercase, with possible [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s and word breaks
:c. A speculative interpretation and translation into [[Classical Latin]]
:d. An English gloss (approximate translation/interpretation) of the Classical Latin rendering

:c. ''Bonus me fecit in manum einom bono, ne me malus [tollito, clepito]''
:d. 'A good man made me in his own[?] hands for a good man, in case an evil man take me.'

An interpretation set out by Warmington and Eichner, renders the complete translation as follows, though not with certainty:
#It is sworn with the gods, whence I'm issued:&lt;br /&gt;If a maiden does not smile at you,
#nor is strongly attracted to you,&lt;br /&gt;then soothe her with this fragrance!
#Someone good has filled me for someone good and well-mannered,&lt;br /&gt;and not shall I be obtained by someone bad.

==Notes==
''Duenos'' is an older form of Classical Latin {{Lang|la|bonus}} ('good'), just as Classical {{Lang|la|[[Polemos|bellum]]}} ('war') is from Old Latin ''duellum''. Some scholars{{who|date=April 2018}} posit Duenos as a proper name, instead of merely an adjective.

The [[Praeneste fibula|Praenestine fibula]] is thought by some to be the earliest surviving evidence of the Latin language dating to the 7th century BC, but has been alleged by [[Margherita Guarducci]] to have been a well-informed hoax; however, the evidence is only circumstantial and there are no clear indications pointing to a forgery. Although these claims have been disproven, as a new analysis performed in 2011 declared it to be genuine "beyond any reasonable doubt".&lt;ref name="maras"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Daniele F. |last=Maras |title=Scientists declare the Fibula Praenestina and its inscription to be genuine 'beyond any reasonable doubt' |url= http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/963/EtruscanNewsVol14_2012_winter.pdf |journal=Etruscan News |volume=14 |date=Winter 2012 |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120224195235/http://ancientstudies.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/963/EtruscanNewsVol14_2012_winter.pdf |archive-date=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epigraphic note==
The inscription (CIL I 2nd  2, 4) is scratched along the side of the body of three vases made of dark brown ''bucchero'', connected with each other by short cylindric arms. It is written from right to left spiralling downwards about {{frac|1|1|2}} times. The letters are written upside-down for a reader who looks at the inscription from a level position; this has been explained by Aldo Luigi Prosdocimi&lt;ref&gt;Aldo Luigi Prosdocimi, "Studi sul latino arcaico", in ''Studi Etruschi'', '''47''', 1979, pp. 173–221.&lt;/ref&gt; as due to the fact that the inscription was meant to be read from above, not from a sideways position. Some letters are written in an archaic fashion that appears influenced by the [[Greek alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Sandys, S. G. Campbell, ''Latin Epigraphy: an Introduction to the study of Latin Inscriptions'' 1974, p. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; There are signs of corrections in the two {{sc2|C}} or {{sc2|K}} of {{sc2|PAKARI}} and {{sc2|FECED}} and in the {{sc2|L}} of {{sc2|MALOS}}. Three distinct sections are individuated by spaces after {{sc2|SIED}} and {{sc2|VOIS}}. There are neither spaces delimiting words nor signs of interpunction. The earliest interpunction to appear was syllabic. As it  appeared only in the 7th century BC, the inscription should be more ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante ''Lingua e cultura degli Etruschi'' Torino, 1985, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription is made up by two distinct parts or sections, the second one beginning with the word {{sc2|DUENOS}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Dressel "Di una antichissima iscrizione latina graffita sopra un vaso votivo rinvenuta a Roma" in ''Annali dell' Istituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica'' '''52''', 1880, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was found in a votive deposit (''favissa''). It belongs to the kind known as ''speaking inscriptions'', widely in use in the [[Classical antiquity#Archaic period .28c.8th to c.6th centuries BC.29|Archaic period]]. Some scholars consider the object to be of good quality and reflecting the high social status of the owner. Others consider it common.

==Site of the find==
{{hatnote|The following sections are mainly based on Osvaldo Sacchi's 2001 article "Il trivaso del Quirinale".&lt;ref&gt;Osvaldo Sacchi, "Il trivaso del Quirinale", in ''Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquité'', 2001, pp. 277–344.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The vase was bought from an [[antiquarian]] by [[Heinrich Dressel]] shortly after its find. It was discovered in 1880 by workers who were digging to lay the foundation of a building near the newly opened [[Via Nazionale (Rome)|Via Nazionale]], in the valley between the [[Quirinal Hill]] and the [[Viminal Hill]]. More precisely it was found on the south slope of the Quirinal, near the church of [[San Vitale, Rome]]. Dressel was told the place was supposed to have been a burial site.&lt;ref&gt;Bréal; Gordon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeologist [[Filippo Coarelli]] has advanced the hypothesis that the object might have been placed in the votive deposit of one of the temples of goddess [[Fortuna]] dedicated by king  [[Servius Tullius]], perhaps the one known as ''Fortuna Publica'' or '' Citerior'', i.e. located on the side of the Quirinal near to Rome. Her festival recurred on the ''nonae'' of April (April 5).&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Coarelli ''Il Foro Boario'' p. 289 ff.; Plutarch ''Quaest. Romanae'' 74 and ''De Fortuna Romana'' 10&lt;/ref&gt; However June 11, the festival day of the [[Matralia]], which was originally devoted to ''Mater Matuta'', was also the day of the ''Fortuna Virgo'', ritually associated with the passage of girls from adolescence into adulthood and married life.&lt;ref&gt;Arnobius ''Adversus Nationes'' II 67; Aurelius Augustinus ''De Civitate Dei'' IV 11; Ovid ''Fasti'' VI 221; [[Mario Torelli]] ''Lavinio e Roma. Riti iniziatici tra archeologia e storia'' 1984, p. 53 ff. and 117 ff.; [[Giovanni Colonna (archaeologist)|Giovanni Colonna]] "Duenos" in ''Studi Etruschi'' '''47''' (1979) p. 168; [[Robert E. A. Palmer]] "Roman shrines of female chastity from the struggle of chastity to the papacy of Innocent I" in ''Rivista Storica dell'Antichità'' '''4'''  (1974) p. 129 ff. (also available as a monograph from the publisher Pàtron) who thinks the sanctuary of the votive deposit should be that of a Fortuna [[Bona Dea]] much more ancient than the Εύελπις and of purely Roman tradition. [[Kurt Latte]] ''Römische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich, 1960, p. 228 ff. excludes the name of Bona Dea as a translation of a Greek theonym.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the linguistic research==
The antiquity of the document is generally acknowledged. The language shows archaic characters in morphology, phonetics and syntax. The absence of ''u'' after ''q'' would testify to its  greater antiquity comparatively to the inscription of the ''cippus'' of the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], also known as [[Lapis Niger]] (CIL I 1).&lt;ref&gt;G. Pennisi "Il tri-vaso di Duenos" in  ''Studi Latini e Italiani'' 1992 p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First section===
For the sake of convenience of interpretation, the text is usually divided into two sections, the first one containing  the first two units and ending with {{sc2|PAKARIVOIS}}. The two sections show a relative syntactic and semantic independence.

Many attempts have been made at deciphering the text.

In the 1950s the inscription had been interpreted mainly on the basis of (and in relation to) the supposed function of the vases, considered either as containers for a love philter or of beauty products: the text would then mockingly threaten the owner about his behaviour towards the vase itself or try to attract a potential buyer.&lt;ref&gt;Emilio Peruzzi "L'iscrizione di Duenos " in ''La Parola del Passato'' '''13''' (1958) p. 328 ff.: the author supposes the object is a love toy and the inscription would be a playful warning to the owner not turn down the object itself, i.e. "he who turns me upside down  (''mitat'') prays the gods that the girl should not give you her favours lest you want to be satisfied through the  workings of ''Tuteria''": Tuteria would then be a proper name  and the object the work of an enchantress that exercised her magic art to get the lost lover back for a female customer of hers; E. Gjerstad "The Duenos vase" in ''Kung. Vitt. och Antikvitets Akademiens Handlingen'' (1959)  pp. 133–143 supposed the object were a container for beauty products and interpreted the text as: "''Iurat deos qui me mittit: 'Ne in te comis virgo sit asted, nisi ope utens ei pacari vis'. Bonus me fecit in bonum atque bono, ne me malus dato!''" , i.e. " 'Thy girl shall not be amiable to thee, unless thou befriend her by using (my) assistance' Good man has made me for a good purpose and for the benefit of a good man; may not a bad man present me!"&lt;/ref&gt; This is the so-called erotic line of interpretation which found supporters until the eighties.&lt;ref&gt;Filippo Coarelli, ''Il Foro Boario'', 1988, p. 289 ff. Tuteria = Tutela would be a theonym, i.e. one of the many personifications of Fortuna, perhaps the Τύχη Εύελπις of the ''vicus Longus'': the meaning of the text would be that of a girl forced to be complacent for the effect of the moderating intervention of a deity in whose sanctuary the vase was dedicated. T. Bolelli. "De antiquissima inscriptione quae Dueni nuncupatur annotationes", in Cipriano, Di Giovine, and Mancini (eds.) ''Miscellanea di studi linguistici in onore di W. Belardi''. '''1''' (1984) pp. 207–214: "Swears for the gods he who sells me that, if the girl is not nice towards you, at least she shall remain with you (i.e. you shall not lose her) lest you want make peace (with her) through the workings of Tuteria (an enchantress)."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s [[Georges Dumézil]] proposed a new line of thought in the interpreting of the text. He remarked the inconsistency of the previous interpretations both with the solemnity of the opening  formula ("''Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat''": 'He swears for the gods who sends /delivers me') and with the site of the find. Dumézil's interpretation was: "If it happens that the girl is not nice to you/ has no easy relationship with you ("''nei ted endo cosmis virco sied''" = "''ne in te (=erga te) cosmis virgo sit''"), we shall have the obligation of bringing  her and you into good harmony, accord, agreement ("''asted noisi ... pakari vois''"="''at sit nobis ... pacari vobis''"). The transmission of the object would be expressed by the words ''qoi med mitat''. The story mirrored in the text would thus depict a custom deeply rooted in Roman society that is described by [[Plautus]] in the scene of the [[Menaechmi]] in which the ''tutor'' of the ''virgo'' or his representatives formally give a suretyship about her attitude towards a man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Dumézil]], "La deuxième ligne de l' "inscription de Duenos" in ''Latomus'' '''102''' 1969, pp. 244-255; id. ''Idées romaines'', Paris, 1969, pp. 12–28; It. tr. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In fact this line of interpretation, based on the reading of ''toiteisai'' as related to ''tutela'' (ward, guardianship) either as a noun (''ope  tutelae'') or an adjective ''tuteria'' (''ope tuteria = ope tutoria''), had already been proposed in 1934 by philologist and literary critic Antonino Pagliaro, who interpreted the segment {{sc2|ASTEDNOISI...PAKARIVOIS}} as meaning: 'unless [''noisi'' = ''nisi''] you will [''vois'' from ''volo'' 'I want'] consider yourself satisfied by the exercise of the marital ''potestas''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'. He understood ''ope tuteria'' as referring  to the ''potestas'' exercised by the husband through the ''manus maritalis'', which would be equated to a sort of ward, ''tutela''. Cf. "La cosiddetta iscrizione di Dueno" in ''Atene e Roma'' '''3''':2, 1934, pp. 162–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil's interpretation though was fraught with linguistic problems. Apart from the value of the {{sc2|I}} before {{sc2|OPE}}, which he considered meaningless or an error of the incisor, the only possible meaning of ''ope'' in Latin is 'by the power or force of', and it governs a word in the genitive case. Thence the only governing word could be the group {{sc2|TOITESIAI}}: this would then be an exception to the rule of the genitive of the themes in ''-a'', which does not end in ''-as'' as expected, an archaism perhaps in Dumézil's view. {{sc2|TOITEISIAI}} would then denote the means by which the ''nois(i)'', 'we', would have the authority of establishing peace between the 'vois' 'you' (the couple) of the main relationship justifying the delivery of the vase.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Georges Dumézil, ''Idées romaines'' p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Dumézil thinks of the involvement of more than one ''tutor'' for each party in order to explain the two plurals ''nois(i)'' and ''vois''. Lastly the ending {{sc|ESIAI}} presents difficulties. It might derive from an archaic ''-e-s-la'' as proposed by H. Osthoff in the formation of Latin abstract names&lt;ref&gt;H. Osthoff, "Die Suffixform ''-sla-'' vornehmlich im Germanischen", in ''Paul und Braunes Beitrage'' '''3''', (1876) pp. 335–347, partic. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; with an assimilation of the liquid into an ''i''. Another possibility would be to interpret the suffix ''-ela'' as ''-e-la'', i.e. as a female derivation of an ancient neuter ''-el'' attested in Hittite.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Émile Benveniste]], ''Origine de la formation de noms en indoeuropéen'', Paris, 1962–1966, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; This would entail admitting the incisor made two errors.

Antonino Pagliaro understood the word {{sc2|TOITESIAI}} as an adjective from noun ''tutela'', ''ope tuteria'', i.e. ''ope tutoria'' in classical Latin: the word would thence be an attribute in the ablative.&lt;ref&gt;Antonino Pagliaro, above, pp. 162 ff.; cf. above note.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumézil's contribution and the location of the find gave researchers grounds to pursue their work of interpretation in the  same direction, i.e. of its significance as a token of legal obligation. The efforts have centred on deciphering of the last segment of the first section, {{sc2|ASTED...PAKARIVOIS}}.

As already mentioned above, the cult of ''Fortuna Virgo'', celebrated on the day of the [[Matralia]], was related to the role of girls who became married women. The passage saw girls as completely passive subjects both during the archaic period and great part of the republican: the matrimonial exchange was conducted, as far as legally relevant profiles were concerned, by the subjects who had ''potestas'' on the woman and by the future husband (or he/those who had ''potestas'' over him). This is testified by the fact the ''virgo'' had no right of pronouncing  the ''nupta verba''.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. ''Nupta verba'', p. 174 L; Paulus exc. Festi s.v. ''Nupta verba'', p. 175 L.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Colonna, ''Duenos'', in SE 1979, p. 168; R. E. A. Palmer, 1974, p. 129 ff.; K. Latte, p. 228 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passage which presents the greatest difficulties is the central group of letters {{sc2|IOPETOITESIAI}} in the string {{sc2|ASTED...VOIS}}. Proposed interpretations include: ''iubet'' orders for {{sc2|IOPET}}; ''futuitioni'' sexual intercourse for {{sc2|IOPETOI}},&lt;ref&gt;Vittore Pisani ''Manuale storico della lingua latina'' Torino, 1948-1950, p. 9: the tutors would guarantee the sexual disponibility/acquiescence of the girl.&lt;/ref&gt; the cut {{sc2|TOI}}/{{sc2|TESIAI}} or {{sc2|OITES}}/{{sc2|IAI}} so that {{sc2|OPE}} would be the only recognisable Latin word.

Dumézil attributes a peculiar semantic value to the syllabic group {{sc2|TOITESIAI}}: a moral instrument that is nothing else than a form of the power the males of a family group (father, tutors) exercised on a girl, i.e. a variant or alteration of the word ''tutelae'', similar to ''tu(i)tela''. Since this interpretation has been proposed no critic has been able to disprove it. Authoritative scholars on the grounds of the lexeme ''toitesiai'' have proposed a theonym (Coarelli), a feminine proper name Tuteria (Peruzzi, Bolelli), or even a ''gentilicium'', the gens Titur(n)ia (Simon and Elboj) mentioned by Cicero.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''Ad Famil.'' XIII 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, two further contributions have discussed once again the interpretation of the second part of the first grapheme, particularly morpheme ''toitesiai''. Even though doubts have been cast over its correspondence with the technical Roman legal word ''tutela'', Dumézil intuition of recognising in the destination of the vase a juridical function, namely a matrimonial ''sponsio'', was accepted and taken on.

G. Pennisi &lt;ref&gt;G. Pennisi, "Il tri-vaso di Duenos", in ''Studi Latini e Italiani'', 1992, p. 7–44.&lt;/ref&gt; reconstructs the text as follows: "''Iovesat deivos qoi med mitat: nei ted cosmis virgo sied ast ednoisi opetoi pakari vois. Duenos med feced en manom einom duenoi ne med malos tatod''". Segment {{sc2|EDNOISI}} is deciphered recurring to Homeric έεδνα in the meaning of nuptial gifts and the speaking token would be a marriage compact or promise by a young man in love to a girl to whom the vase is presented as a gift. The inscription would thence exhibit an oath structure consisting in an archaic form of ''[[coemptio]]'': "Swears for the gods he who buys me": ''mitat = *emitat'' (the future bridegroom would be speaking in the third person). Then passing to the second person the compact would be set out in the second line by the offering of the nuptial gifts as a guarantee. The third line would complete the legal formula of the compact (''Duenos / ne med malos tatod'').
Leo Peppe&lt;ref&gt;Leo Peppe, "Storie di parole, storie di istituti sul diritto matrimoniale arcaico", in  ''Studia et Documenta Historiae et Iuris'' 1997, pp. 123 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed to interpret the inscription as a primitive form of matrimonial ''coemptio'' different from that presented in [[Gaius]], consisting in a cumulative acceptance that included both the legal aspects concerning  the transmission of the dotal assets and the religious ones inherent in the matrimonial cults and rites.

F. Marco Simon and G. Fontana Elboj (autopsy) confirmed the interpretation of the previous proposals that see in the vase the symbol of a marriage compact. The authors ground their  interpretation on the segment {{sc2|OITESIAI}} instead of {{sc2|TOITESIAI}}. They therefore identified a root ''*o-it'' (composed by prefix ''*o'' and [[lexeme]] ''*i-'', cf. Latin  ''eo'') related to classic Latin ''utor'', and suffix ''-esios/a'' (cf. ''Valesios'' of the [[Lapis Satricanus]] and ''Leucesie'' of the [[carmen Saliare]]). The substantive ''oitesiai'' would be thus related to the semantic field of ''utor'' i.e. the concept of ''utilitas''. Therefore, the text should be divided as: ''asted noisi; opet otesiai pakari vois''. ''Opet'' would be an articulatory fusion  between the dative ''opi'' and conjunction ''et''. The whole text should thus be understood as: ''Ni erga te virgo comis sit, asted nobis; (iurat) opi et utilitati pangi vois'', 'if the girl is not to your taste/agreeable to you, let her go back to us; (he swears) to give you guarantee about your disturb and your interest'. The segment ''oitesiai'' could be also understood as ''utensilium'' referred to the vase itself as a token of suretiship or ''[[usus]]'' in the technical legal sense of Roman marriage as a way of providing a guarantee. The last two hypotheses are, however, considered unacceptable by the authors on the grounds that no genitive marker is to be found in the segment ''oitesiai''.&lt;ref&gt;F. Marco Simon and G. Fontana Elboj, "Sponsio matrimonial en la Roma arcaica", in ''Revue International de Droit de l'Antiquité'' '''43''', 1996, pp. 232–234.&lt;/ref&gt;
The proposed interpretation would find support in its strict analogy with a passage of [[Terentius]]'s [[Hecyra]] (vv. 136–151), in which a story similar to that supposedly recorded on  the vase is described. The text would thus be the undertaking of an obligation concerning the eventuality that the girl go back to her family of origin, should she be not liked by the bridegroom (''asted endo cosmis virco sied, asted noisi'').

Even after the last two contributions related above, Sacchi acknowledges that all attempts at interpreting the segment {{sc2|AST...VOIS}} remain conjectural.

Dumézil's hypothesis of a protoform of ''tutela'', though attractive and plausible, remains unconfirmed.

===Juridical note on the matrimonial ''sponsio''===
Although there are still obscure points in the interpretation of line two, it is generally accepted that the text contains the formula of an oath. On the archaic oath and its juridical value there is large agreement among scholars. It looks also probable that the object should have a religious implication: an instrument permeated by religious ritualism, as the oath could well be employed in legal practice at the time of the object, as seems supported by linguistic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Benveniste, ''Le vocabulaire des institutions indoeuropeennes'', Italian translation, 1976, vol. II, pp. 367–375; Giacomo Devoto, "Parole giuridiche", in ''Scritti minori'' I, 1958, p. 100; Osvaldo Sacchi, "Il trivaso del Quirinale", in ''Revue Interantionale de Droit de l'Antiquité'', 2001, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; The usage of the oath in archaic times as an instrument of private civil law could have been widespread, even though the issue has not yet been thoroughly analysed.&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi, above, p. 302-303; Salvatore Tondo "La semantica di sacramentum nella sfera giudiziale" in ''Studia et Documenta Historiae et iuris'' '''35''', 1969 p. 305 and  337; Francesco Sini ''Documenti sacerdotali di Roma antica'' I. ''Libri e commentari'' Sassari, 1983, p.164; Antonello Calore, ''Per Iovem lapidem'', 2000, p.146; Filippo Cancelli, ''La giuriprudenza unica dei pontefici'', Milano, 1996, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though in the inscription there is no segment directly reminiscent of the dialogic formula of the ''sponsio'', i.e. "''spondes tu ...?''", "''spondeo!''", internal and external evidence allow the assumption of the enactment of a matrimonial ''sponsio''.&lt;ref&gt;''Res sacrae'' were the straight ''tunica'' and the yellow network worn by the bride. Festus s. v. ''spondere'', p. 440 L, derives ''sponsio'' from Greek σπονδάς, i.e. the sacred libation the bride and bridegroom dedicated to the gods.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a usage of oaths is attested in later literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Naturalis Historia'', XXVIII 27; Servius, ''Ad Georgicas'', I 21; Plautus, ''Cistellaria'' 98; Ovid, ''Epodes'', XXI 133-144; O. Sacchi, above, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the trace of a ''sponsio'' as the legal function of the object, Dumézil would also see that of providing a piece evidence, i.e. a probatory attitude. [[Servius]] in his commentary to the ''Aeneid'' writes that, before the introduction of the matrimonial tablets, in Latium the parties used to exchange tokens of pledge (''symbola'') on which they stated as a promise that they agreed to the marriage and nominated guarantors (''sponsores''). To the same time of the regal period is ascribed the introduction of the Greek use of double scriptures, ''tesserae''.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, ''Aeneis'', X 79: ''Legere furari ... Gremiis abducere pactas id est sponsas: nam ante usum tabularum matrimonii cautiones sibi invicem emittebant, et fideiussores dabant: unde admissum est ut sponsum dicamus virum a spondendo, et sponsam promissam. Ceterum proprie sponderi puallae est: ergo sponsus non quia promittitur, sed quia spondet et sponsores dat. Sane exaggeratio est nimia in quod ait 'gremiis abducere', tamquam iam uxores.'': the allusion to the simulated abduction of the girl reflects a practice attested in rural Latium til the time of the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|social war]] according to Gellius: cf. Paulus ex Festus s.v. ''rapi'', p. 365 L; Simon and  Elboj, above, p. 267; Georges Dumézil, ''Idées romaines'', p. 23; G. Colonna, above, p. 168, n. 4; O. Sacchi, above, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sponsio is one of the most ancient forms of verbal undertaking of obligation and its religious nature is acknowledged, as well as its connection with betrothal.&lt;ref&gt;Arangio-Ruiz, ''Instituciones'', p. 446; W. H. Buckler, ''Obligation in Roman Law'', New York, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient sources are in agreement that the archaic ''sponsalia'' had a religious nature.&lt;ref&gt;F. Fabbrini, ''Novissimo Digesto Italiano'', '''15''', 1968, p.510, s.v. ''Res divini iuris'' for a review; Festus s.v. spondere, p. 440 L.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brent Vine's study&lt;ref&gt;''A Note on the Duenos Inscription'' 1997&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the linguistic analysis of the word {{sc2|MITAT}} of the first sentence and of the segment {{sc2|EN()MANOMEINOM}} of the third lends support to such an interpretation: he argues that ''mitat'' would be a form of a frequentative verb ''mitare'' based on a past participle in -''to'' of an IE root ''*meɨ̯'', with the meaning of 'exchange'. Semantically this frequentative should be considered factitive, thence arriving at a verb that would mean 'to cause to be given in exchange', hence 'to give (in exchange)'. Vine's analysis of the segment {{sc2|EN()MANOMEINOM}} fits the hypothesis of an exchange of ''symbola'' equally  well. He argues that a word {{sc2|[M]EINOM}} could be isolated on the grounds of the single spelling of geminates which is considered normal by linguists for the archaic period. This he proposes to understand as reflecting a substantivised ''*méi̯-no-'', meaning 'something given in exchange, gift' from the same root ''*mei̯ '' as in {{sc2|MITAT}}.  This form would be a -''no'' substantive, a widely attested formation and may be presupposed by Latin ''mūnus, mūneris'' 'duty, service, office, offering', from immediate antecedent ''*mói̯-n-es-''. The appearance of ''mitat'' and ''[m]einom'' show a semantic contiguity and may constitute a [[figura etymologica]]. This alliterative form would be analogous to the Old Latin phrase ''donum do'', ''donum'' being formed exactly in the same way as supposed for ''[m]einom'' (''*déh3-no-''). ''*Meinom mito'' would have existed beside ''donum do'', both referring to similar but culturally distinct behaviours, the first one perhaps "specifically involving exchange/reciprocity".{{cite quote|date=November 2017|reason=It's unclear which source this phrase is supposed to ahve come from.}}

The document raises also the question of the kind of the marriage in question, and specifically of whether it was with or without ''[[Manus marriage|manus]]''. Dumézil supported the thesis of a marriage without loss the independent status of the woman (''sine capitis deminutio''). In the last case it should be admitted that in archaic times a form of marriage existed in which the ''sponsio'' was directly linked to the ''nuptiae'', independently from the initial constitution of the ''manus''. The  ''sponsalia'' would then be the occasion upon which the legal subjects defined the compacts concerning  the juridical and economic aspects of the marriage:&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''Lingua Latina'', VI 70-71; Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', IV 4, 1; Ulpian apud ''Digesta'', XXIII 1, 2: "''Sponsalia dicta sunt a spondendo: nam moris fuit veteribus stipulari et spondere sibi uxores futuras''".&lt;/ref&gt; the dowry, the future legal status of the woman who could be put under the ''potestas/tutela'' of one or more persons,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plautus ''Curc.'' 672.&lt;/ref&gt; the compensations for  a passage of status of the woman and the guarantees for breach of promise. Two strata were perhaps present as testified by the expression ''more atque iure'' of Gellius.

Then the object in question could well have been deposited in a temple upon the occasion of a marriage ritual as a probatory document of an engagement undertaken not by the girl but by her ''sponsor''. The compact would be also a legal guarantee of the rights of the future bridegroom.

===The second section===

The most relevant issue for the interpretation of the document in Sacchi's view is the meaning the lexical couple {{sc2|DUENOS/DUENOI}}. The meaning of ''Duenos'' has been often considered to be the name of the craftsman who made the object. Such an interpretation  meets with the difficulty of how to explain the second occurrence of the word and with the problem of how to interpret {{sc2|MANOM}}, since if ''Duenos'' is a name identifying a person and qualifying  him as 'good' then it would difficult to understand the use of ''manom'' in the same sense of 'good'. It should be easier to understand ''manom'' as ''manum'' ('hand'), i.e. reading: "Duenos made me with his own hands".

Sacchi, following Palmer and Colonna,&lt;ref&gt;R. E. A. Palmer above; G. Colonna above.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes to interpret the couple as conveying a specifically technical religious and legal meaning as is testified in ancient sources. ''Duenos'' has given classic Latin ''bonus'', 'good',&lt;ref&gt;Paulus ex Festo s. v. Matrem Matutam, p. 109 L; Varro, LL VI 4; Varro, VII 26 "''Ian cusianes duonus ceruses duonus Ianusve''": Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' I 3, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; but originally the adjective had certainly religious and sacral implications: in the oldest sacral formulae it had a more technical acception and the repetition had other implications than just [[eurythmy]]. Colonna refers to the formula ''optumus duonorum'' of the mid republic which was a qualificative formula with sacral implication reserved to the upper classes. Correspondences are the opposition of the epithets ''Optimus'' and ''Maximus'' of Capitoline Jupiter, the early Faliscan ''Titia'' inscription "''Eco quton euotenosio titias duenom duenas. Salu[...]voltene''"&lt;ref&gt;To be read as: "''Eco quto*e votenosio titias duenom duenas salve[...]d voltene''" according  to Bakkum, ''The Latin Dialect of the Ager Faliscus: 150 Years of Scholarsahip'', Amsterdam, 2009, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted as 'good among  the good', the epitaph of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Scipio]], the  consul of 259 BC, ''duonoro[m] optumo[m]... viro[m]'' in which clearly the adjective ''duonus'' is not the synonym of ''optumus'', that as derived from ''ops'', plenty, has different semantic connotations. Colonna also reminds that "in the [[carmen Saliare]] (similarly to the Duenos vase) ''bonus'' (''duonus'') and ''manus'' occur together, both referred to the same character, the god ''Cerus'', fact that makes their synonymity implausible".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Festus s.v. ''Matrem Matutam'': "''... et in carmine Saliari Cerus manus intelligitur creator bonus''" p. 109 L; also  s. v. mane  p. 112 L; Varro ''Lingua Latina'' VII 26: "''ian cusianes duonus ceruses du(o)nus ianusve''"; Colonna, above, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further clarify the use of the adjective in  the text, Sacchi makes reference also to a well-known passage of Cicero's ''De Legibus'' II 9, 22: ''Deorum Manium iura sancta sunto. (B)onos leto datos divos habento ...''. Here too as in the above two instances "one can remark the opposition between ''Manium'', that, as shown in Paulus exc. Festi, originally meant 'the good ones' and the qualificative (B)onos = Duenos as referred to the deified dead (= ''divos''). Cicero here relates a pontifical prescription of high antiquity consciously preserving  the original wise of expression and lexic".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero ''De Legibus'' II 7, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one could argue that it is not meant that the ''dii [[Manes]]'' become 'good' in the ethic sense, but rather that the dead consecrated to death according to the pontifical prescriptions (''leto datos'') do become gods (= ''divos'').&lt;ref&gt;O. Sacchi, above, p. 333; also citing Georges Dumézil, ''Idées romaines'', pp. 24-25: ''dueno-'' from ''dúvas'' 'cult, offering to a god', "later ''bonus'' used alone shall take up all other values"; A. Ernout and A. Meillet, ''Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue latine'', Paris, 1967, p. 73: "''*dwenos'' from root ''*du-'', technical religious term, Sanskrit ''dúvah'' = 'hommage' ... in Latin religious language ''di boni''"&lt;/ref&gt; The epithet ''duenos''  would then design that which has been given in homage, consecrated correctly according to the pontifical ritual.

Sacchi opines that in the case of the Duenos inscription the speaker is acting according to the religious legal ritual, presumably enacting a private ''consecratio'': the formula of the dedication is then a case of private ''dedicatio dis'', dedication to the gods. The epithet ''duenos'' should therefore be interpreted as used in its original technical sense. The restitution of the text should thus be: "A party acting in the way sanctioned by religious law made/consecrated me for a good end. That no harm/fraud be done to me and to one who is a party (equally) religiously sanctioned by the gods".&lt;ref&gt;A better rendering might be: "... that no harm/fraud be done through me to one who is a party sanctioned by the gods".&lt;/ref&gt; The vase is a speaking token that after the celebration of the ritual consecrates the content of the action, of which it is "the form in its probatory function and the matter as a constituent element".&lt;ref&gt;Taking into account Brent Vine's hypothesis about the interpretation of ''[m]einom'' as ''munus'' though the rendering of the text should be somewhat altered and interpreted as: "A '{{sc2|DUENOS}}' (as above) made me as a good (legal etc.) gift/offering/token, that no evil/harm be done through me to a '{{sc2|DUENOS}}'" or "that no evil party lay me to a '{{sc2|DUENOS}}'".&lt;/ref&gt;

Vine quotes German authors who still follow the erotic thread of interpretation. They think of the vase as a container for beauty products and interpret the last phrase {{sc2|NEMEDMALOSTATOD}} as 'let no evil person steal me'. "{{sc2|STATOD}} would be a form of a Latin verb ''*stare'' that failed to survive for its ''homonymie fâcheuse'' [unfortunate [[homonym]]y&lt;nowiki /&gt;] with the ordinary verb for 'stand{{'"}}, as found in Hittite ''tāyezzi'' 'steals', Vedic ''stená-stāyú'' 'thief'.&lt;ref&gt;H. Rix, "Das letzte Wort der Duenos-Inschrif", MSS, '''46''', 1985, pp. 193 ff.; H. Eichner, "Reklameniamben aus Roms Königszeit", ''Die Sprache'', '''34''', 1988-90, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Sacchi and Vine remark the striking parallelism between the formula of the Duenos inscription: {{sc2|QOIMED MITAT}} and the inscription on a pedestal (probably of a votive statue) from [[Tibur]]: {{sc2|HOI()MED()MITAT...D[O]NOM()PRO()FILEOD}}.&lt;ref&gt;R. Wachter, ''Altlateinische Inschriften'', Bern / Frankfurt am Mein / New York / Paris, 1987; M. Cristofani (ed.), ''La Grande Roma dei Tarquini (Catalogue of the Exhibition, Roma, 12 June to 30 September 1990)'', Rome: L'Erma di Bretscheider, 1990, {{ISBN|88-7062-684-9}}, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Vine finds in it support for his interpreting of {{sc2|[M]EINOM}} as meaning  ''munus''.

===Cosmis===
Sacchi rejects the interpretation of ''cosmis'' as ''agreeable'' in the first section that is traditionally accepted in the  scholarly literature, on the grounds of considerations of history of the language and semantics. He proposes to interpret the term as referring to the peculiar style of hairdressing of brides, known as  ''seni crines'' which would find support in Festus:&lt;ref&gt;Festus s.v. ''Comptus'', p. 55 L.&lt;/ref&gt; "''Comptus id est ornatus ... qui apud nos comis: et comae dicuntur capilli cum aliqua cura compositi''", '&lt;nowiki /&gt;''Comptus'', that is adorned, ... what we call ''comis''; and ''comae'' is named the hair dressed with a certain care'. In the inscription the use of this word would be an explicit allusion to the fact that the girl shall be ready to marry. Festus gives it as a most ancient custom for marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Festus s. v. Senis crinibus, p. 454 L: "''Senis crinibus nubentes ornantur, quod [h]is ornatus vestustissimus fuit''".&lt;/ref&gt; An analogous usage of the word ''comis'' is to be found in Gellius while relating the custom of ''flaminica dialis'' on the occasion of the [[Argei]].&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noct. Att.'', X 15, 30: "''... cum it ad Argeos, quod neque comit caput neque capillum depictit''".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ijoid''' is a proposed but undemonstrated group of languages linking the [[Ijaw languages]] (Ịjọ) with the endangered [[Defaka language]]. The similarities, however, may be due to Ijaw influence on Defaka.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench, [http://www.rogerblench.info/Language/Niger-Congo/General/Niger-Congo%20an%20alternative%20view.pdf Niger-Congo: an alternative view]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ijoid, or perhaps just Ijaw, languages form a divergent branch of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo family]] and are noted for their [[subject–object–verb]] basic word order, which is otherwise an unusual feature in Niger–Congo, shared only by such distant branches as [[Mande languages|Mande]] and [[Dogon languages|Dogon]]. Like Mande and Dogon, Ijoid lacks even traces of the [[noun class]] system considered characteristic of Niger–Congo, and so may have split early from that family. Linguist Gerrit Dimmendaal doubts its inclusion in Niger–Congo altogether and considers the Ijaw/Ijoid languages to be an independent family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0U4k9duWUOIC|title=Historical Linguistics and the Comparative Study of African Languages|last=Dimmendaal|first=Gerrit Jan|date=2011-01-01|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=9027211787|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inkstand''' is a stand or tray used to house writing instruments, with a tightly-capped inkwell and a sand shaker for rapid drying. A penwiper would often be included, and from the mid-nineteenth century, a compartment for steel nibs, which replaced quill pens. Inkstands with tightly closing lids, often finely made, were part and parcel of a traveling kit, until the widespread use of the [[fountain pen]]. Inkstands were going out of use before the development of [[ballpoint pen]], which finished them as a primary source of ink.

The [[Syng inkstand]], made in 1752 by [[Philip Syng]], was used by the American delegates to sign both the [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 and the [[United States Constitution]] in 1787.

==Cognitive neuroscientist==

Lauwereyns was born in [[Antwerp]], Belgium. He obtained his PhD at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]], Belgium, in 1998 with a thesis on the intentionality of visual selective attention. He has since conducted research and lectured on the neural mechanisms of [[perception]] and [[decision making]] at several institutes, including the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (Bethesda, Maryland), [[Juntendo University]] (Tokyo, Japan), and [[Victoria University of Wellington]] (Wellington, New Zealand). He is currently Professor in the Faculty of Arts and Science and in the Graduate School of Systems Life Sciences at [[Kyushu University]] (Fukuoka, Japan).

===The Intensive Approach===
In 2010, The MIT Press published his monograph ''The Anatomy of Bias'', an integrative account of the structure and function of bias and sensitivity. Lauwereyns connects findings and ideas in neuroscience to analogous concepts in psychonanalysis, literary theory, philosophy of mind, and experimental economics.&lt;ref name="mitpress" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  | doi=10.5406/amerjpsyc.124.4.0494}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A second monograph, ''Brain and the Gaze'', followed in 2012, also published by The MIT Press. This book, like the previous, offers an integration of perspectives from philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience; this time focusing on active vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  | doi=10.1068/p4207rvw
  | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, Lauwereyns develops ''The Intensive Approach'', "a smart and reasonable combination of classic computational theories of perception (a la Marr) that say that vision is essentially a top-down process, and less conservative accounts (a la Noë) that emphasise the pervasive sensorimotor nature of perceptual experience and the role that (bottom-up) sensorimotor engagements play in visual processes. The intensive approach to vision is therefore a (top-down, bottom-up) approach that highlights the deeply interactive nature of perceptual awareness, while assigning a fundamental role to observer-dependent biases and to internal mechanisms in the processing of perceptual experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  | year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingual poet==

Lauwereyns has published single-author volumes of poetry in his native language, Dutch, and in Japanese and English. He has received several prizes and nominations for his work in Dutch,&lt;ref name="poetryinternationalweb" /&gt; most notably the [[VSB Poetry Prize]] 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

According to the Flemish Literature Fund, his "analytical approach of poetic subjects produces a remarkable effect: funny, incisive and unsettling all at once. It is a poetry of crackling brain cells".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The poetry of Lauwereyns "embodies a relationship with the impossibility of perfection. The formal experiment of writing (sometimes in collaboration, in a range of languages) substantiates, up to a point and never completely, the insistent presence of absence.

'''Jukun''' (''Njikum''), or more precisely '''Jukun Takum''', is a [[Jukunoid language]] of [[Cameroon]] used as a [[trade language]] in [[Nigeria]]. Though there are only a few thousand native speakers, and only a dozen in Nigeria (as of 2000), it is spoken as a second language in Nigeria by tens of thousands (40,000 reported in 1979).

The name ''Jukun'' is a cover term for several related Jukunoid languages, such as the much-more-numerous [[Wapan language|Jukun Wapan]].

'''Krasnodon''' ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]]: Краснодон) is a [[city]] in [[Luhansk Oblast]] ([[Oblast|region]]) of eastern [[Ukraine]]. It is incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and serves as the administrative center of [[Krasnodon Raion]] ([[Raion|district]]), though it does not belong to the raion. Its population is approximately {{Ua-pop-est2017|43,683}}.

Population of Krasnodon in 1972 was 70,400, in 1989 it was around 53,000, in 2001 it was 49,921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/city/|script-title=ru:Численность и состав населения Украины|publisher=ukrcensus.gov.ua|accessdate=March 19, 2009|language=ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329054705/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/rus/results/general/city|archivedate=March 29, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the city was renamed into '''Sorokyne''' ({{lang-ua|Сорокине}}; {{lang-ru|Сорокино}}) as part of [[decommunization in Ukraine]]. The city's name change process is temporarily suspended as it is not controlled by the government of Ukraine.

==History==
Krasnodon was established in 1914 along the banks of the Velyka Kamyanka, a tributary of the [[Seversky Donets|Seversky Donets River]], as the settlement of '''Sorokino'''.{{cn|date=February 2016}} It soon became one of the centers of the [[coal mining]] industry of the [[Donbass]] region.{{cn|date=February 2016}} By the ''Decision of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet|Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR]]'', on 28 October 1938 it was renamed to ''Krasnodon''.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

During the [[German-Soviet War]], Krasnodon was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from July 20, 1942 to February 14, 1943.{{cn|date=February 2016}} The Soviet [[Komsomol]] organization resistance [[Young Guard (Soviet resistance)|Young Guard]] operated in the city from October 1942 to January 1943, when most of its members were arrested and executed.{{cn|date=February 2016}} The ''Young Guard'' are commemorated with monuments and a [[memorial]] complex in Krasnodon.{{cn|date=February 2016}}

Since 2014, Krasnodon has been controlled by the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] and not by Ukrainian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gkslg.info/files/chisl_0915.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204211939/http://gkslg.info/files/chisl_0915.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 February 2016|title=Численность населения по состоянию на 1  октября  2015 года по  Луганской Народной Республ ике|publisher=[[Luhansk People's Republic]]|language=Russian|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NATO]] released satellite data from 21 August 2014 and confirmed it showed a large column of armoured vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Russia through Krasnodon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = New Satellite Imagery Exposes Russian Combat Troops Inside Ukraine| url = http://www.aco.nato.int/new-satellite-imagery-exposes-russian-combat-troops-inside-ukraine.aspx| date = 28 August 2014| accessdate = 31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laal''' is an endangered language isolate spoken by 749 people ({{as of|2000|lc=on}}) in three villages in the [[Moyen-Chari Prefecture|Moyen-Chari]] prefecture of [[Chad]] on opposite banks of the [[Chari River]], 
called [[Gori, Chad|Gori]] (''lá''), Damtar (''ɓual''), and Mailao. It may be a [[language isolate]] and thus would represent an isolated survival of an earlier language group of [[Central Africa]]. It is unwritten except in [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] by linguists. According to former [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]]-Chad member David Faris, it is in danger of extinction, with most people under 25 shifting to the locally more widespread [[Bagirmi language|Bagirmi]].

This language first came to the attention of academic linguists in 1977 through Pascal Boyeldieu's fieldwork in 1975 and 1978. His fieldwork was based, for the most part, on a single speaker, M. Djouam Kadi of Damtar.

==Speakers and status==
The language's speakers are mainly [[river]] [[fishing|fishermen]] and [[agriculture|farmer]]s, who also sell [[salt]] extracted from the ashes of [[doum palm]]s and ''[[Vossia cuspidata]]''. Like their neighbours, the [[Niellim language|Niellim]], they were formerly cattle herders but lost their herds around the turn of the 19th century. They are mainly [[Muslim]]s, but until the latter half of the 20th century, they followed the traditional ''Yondo'' religion of the Niellim.  The area is fairly undeveloped; while there are [[Qur'anic school]]s in Gori and Damtar, the nearest government school is 7&amp;nbsp;km away, and there is no medical dispensary in the region ({{as of|1995|lc=on}}).

The village of [[Damtar]] formerly had a distinct dialect, called Laabe (''la:bé''), with two or three speakers remaining in 1977; it was replaced by the dialect of Gori after two Gori families fled there at the end of the 19th century to escape a [[war]]. No other dialects of Laal are known.

Under Chadian law, Laal, like all languages of Chad other than [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], is regarded as a [[national language]]. Although the 1996 Constitution stipulates that "the law shall fix the conditions of promotion and development of national languages", national languages are not used for education, for official purposes, or usually for written media, but some of the larger ones (but not Laal) are used on the radio.

==Classification==
Laal remains [[unclassified language|unclassified]], although extensive [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] (specifically [[Bua languages|Bua]]) and to a lesser extent [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] influence is found. It is sometimes grouped with one of those two [[language family|language families]], and sometimes seen as a [[language isolate]].  Boyeldieu (1982) summarizes his view as "Its classification remains problematic; while it shows certain lexical, and no doubt morphological, traits with the Bua languages (Adamawa-13, [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo family]] of [[Joseph Greenberg|Joseph H. Greenberg]]), it differs from them radically in many ways of which some, ''a priori'', make one think of geographically nearby Chadic languages."  Roger Blench (2003), similarly, considers that "its vocabulary and morphology seem to be partly drawn from Chadic (i.e. [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]), partly from [[Adamawa languages|Adamawa]] (i.e. Niger–Congo) and partly from an unknown source, perhaps its original phylum, a now-vanished grouping from [[Central Africa]]."  It is the latter possibility which attracts particular interest; if this proves true, Laal may be the only remaining window on the linguistic state of Central Africa before the expansion of the main [[African language]] families—Afro-Asiatic, [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]], and Niger–Congo—into it.

Their immediate neighbors speak [[Bua language|Bua]], [[Niellim language|Niellim]], and [[Ndam language|Ndam]]. Laal contains a number of [[loanword]]s from Baguirmi, which for several centuries was the lingua franca of the region under the [[Baguirmi Empire]], and perhaps a dozen Chadic roots, which are not similar to the Chadic languages that currently neighbor Laal. In addition, almost all Laal speak Niellim as a second language, and 20%–30% of their vocabulary is cognate with Niellim, especially agricultural vocabulary (Boyeldieu 1977, Lionnet 2010). Like the [[Baguirmi language|Baguirmi]], the Laal are [[Muslim]]s; partly because of this, some [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords are also found. However some 60% of the vocabulary, including most core vocabulary, cannot be identified with any known language family (Lionnet 2010). Indeed, some of the words cognate with Niellim, including some basic vocabulary, is not cognate with closely related Bua, suggesting that these are not Adamawa roots but loans in Niellim from the Laal substrate (Lionnet 2010). Pozdniakov (2010) believes Laal is a distinct branch of Niger–Congo with part of its pronominal system borrowed from a Chadic language like Kera.

Alternatively, it may be a language descending from a language of a group of Neolithic Near Eastern farmers who immigrated to Chad, since recent genetic studies have found that the Laal people have significant Eurasian admixture similar to [[Natufian]]s and Neolithic Levantines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(16)30448-7 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.10.012| pmid=27889059| pmc=5142112| title=Chad Genetic Diversity Reveals an African History Marked by Multiple Holocene Eurasian Migrations| journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics| volume=99| issue=6| pages=1316–1324| year=2016| last1=Haber| first1=Marc| last2=Mezzavilla| first2=Massimo| last3=Bergström| first3=Anders| last4=Prado-Martinez| first4=Javier| last5=Hallast| first5=Pille| last6=Saif-Ali| first6=Riyadh| last7=Al-Habori| first7=Molham| last8=Dedoussis| first8=George| last9=Zeggini| first9=Eleftheria| last10=Blue-Smith| first10=Jason| last11=Wells| first11=R. Spencer| last12=Xue| first12=Yali| last13=Zalloua| first13=Pierre A.| last14=Tyler-Smith| first14=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nature19310| pmid=27459054|pmc = 5003663| title=Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East| journal=Nature| volume=536| issue=7617| pages=419–424| year=2016| last1=Lazaridis| first1=Iosif| last2=Nadel| first2=Dani| last3=Rollefson| first3=Gary| last4=Merrett| first4=Deborah C.| last5=Rohland| first5=Nadin| last6=Mallick| first6=Swapan| last7=Fernandes| first7=Daniel| last8=Novak| first8=Mario| last9=Gamarra| first9=Beatriz| last10=Sirak| first10=Kendra| last11=Connell| first11=Sarah| last12=Stewardson| first12=Kristin| last13=Harney| first13=Eadaoin| last14=Fu| first14=Qiaomei| last15=Gonzalez-Fortes| first15=Gloria| last16=Jones| first16=Eppie R.| last17=Roodenberg| first17=Songül Alpaslan| last18=Lengyel| first18=György| last19=Bocquentin| first19=Fanny| last20=Gasparian| first20=Boris| last21=Monge| first21=Janet M.| last22=Gregg| first22=Michael| last23=Eshed| first23=Vered| last24=Mizrahi| first24=Ahuva-Sivan| last25=Meiklejohn| first25=Christopher| last26=Gerritsen| first26=Fokke| last27=Bejenaru| first27=Luminita| last28=Blüher| first28=Matthias| last29=Campbell| first29=Archie| last30=Cavalleri| first30=Gianpiero| displayauthors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Implosives and prenasalised stops as well as h are found only word-initially.    Voiceless stops as well as s cannot occur at the end of a syllable. {{IPA|/ŋ/}} occurs only intervocalically and word-finally. {{IPA|/s/}} appears exclusively in [[loanword]]s and certain numbers.  Prenasalized stops as well as the implosive {{IPA|/ʄ/}} are extremely rare.

===Vowels===
The vowel system for non-initial syllables is {{IPA|/i/, /ɨ/, /u/, /e/, /ə/, /o/, /a/}} and the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/ua/}}, with no length distinction.  For initial syllables, however, it is much more complicated, allowing length distinctions and distinguishing the following additional diphthongs:  {{IPA|/ia/, /yo/, /ya/}} (but the latter two appear only as morphologically conditioned forms of {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ia/}} and so are perhaps better seen as allophonic).

In addition, {{IPA|/y/}} may occur very occasionally; Boyeldieu quotes the example of ''mỳlùg'' "red (pl.)".

There are three level tones: high (á), middle (a), low (à). Combinations mau occur on a single vowel, resulting in phonetic rising and falling tone, and which are phonemically sequences of level tones. Such cases are transcribed here by repeating the vowel (e.g. àá); long vowels are indicated only by a colon (e.g. a:).

Suffixes may force any of four kinds of [[ablaut]] on the vowels of preceding words: raising (takes {{IPA|/ia/, /a/, /ua/}} to {{IPA|[e], [ə], [o]}}), lowering (takes {{IPA|/e/, /ə/, /o/}} to {{IPA|[ia], [a], [ua]}}), low rounding (takes {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɨ/}} to {{IPA|[u]}}; {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ia/}} to {{IPA|[yo]}}; {{IPA|/ə/, /a/}}, and {{IPA|/ua/}} to {{IPA|[o]}}), and high rounding (takes {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɨ/}} to {{IPA|[u]}}; {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ia/}} to {{IPA|[ya]}}; {{IPA|/ə/, /a/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}} to {{IPA|[ua]}}). They are transcribed in the suffix section as ↑, ↓, ↗, ↘ respectively. In some verbs, a/ə is "raised" to {{IPA|[e]}} rather than, as expected, to {{IPA|[ə]}}.

In suffixes, ə and o undergo [[vowel harmony]]: they become {{IPA|ɨ}} and u respectively if the preceding vowel is one of {i, {{IPA|ɨ}}, u}. Likewise, r undergoes consonant harmony, becoming l after words containing l.  Suffixes with a neutral tone copy the final tone of the word to whuch they are suffixed.[https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42030562/African_linguistic_isolates.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1526872805&amp;Signature=QykLYKQ%2BZ0SaMXcREtVAyBJD0rI%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAfrican_language_isolates.pdf]

==Morphology==
===Syntax===
The typical [[word order]] can be summarised as [[subject (grammar)|subject]]–(verbal [[particle (grammar)|particle]])–[[verb]]–[[object (grammar)|object]]–[[adverb]]; [[preposition]]–[[noun]]; [[possession (linguistics)|possessed–possessor]]; [[noun]]–[[adjective]].  Nouns can be fronted when [[topic (linguistics)|topic]]alized.  See the [[#Sample sentences|sample sentences]] below for examples and the [[#Conjunctions|conjunctions]] for clause syntax.

===Nouns===
Nouns have plural and singular forms (the latter are perhaps better viewed as [[singulative]] in some cases), with plural formation hard to predict: ''kò:g'' "bone" &gt; ''kuagmi'' "bones", ''tuà:r'' "chicken" &gt; ''tò:rò'' "chickens", ''ɲaw'' "hunger" &gt; ''ɲə̀wə́r'' "hungers". Nouns do not have arbitrary gender, but three  natural genders (male, female, non-human) are distinguished by pronouns.

The possessive is expressed in two ways:
* "[[inalienable possession|inalienable]]", or direct, possession: by following the possessed with the possessor (and modifying the tone or ending of the possessed in some cases): ''piá:r no'' "person's leg" ("leg person");
* [[alienable possession]]: by putting a connecting word, conjugated according to number and gender, between the possessed and the possessor: ''làgɨˋm má màr-dɨb'' "blacksmith's horse" ("horse CONN. man+of-forge"). The connecting word is sometimes abbreviated to a simple high tone.

However, if the possessor is a pronoun, it is suffixed with extensive vowel [[ablaut]] (in the first case) or prepositional forms with "at" and optionally the connector as well, are used (in the second case): ''na:ra ɟá ɗe:'' "my man" ("man CONN. at-me"), ''mùlù'' "her eye" ("eye-her", from ''mɨla'' "eye").  Some nouns (''páw-'' "friend") occur only with bound pronouns and have no independent form. That is called [[obligatory possession]] and is found in many other language, usually for words referring to personal relationships.  See [[#Pronouns|pronouns]] for the relevant suffixes.

A noun indicating someone who does, is, or has something can be formed with the prefix ''màr'', meaning roughly "he/she/it who/of": ''màr jùgòr'' "landowner", ''màr ce'' "farmer" (''ce'' = cultivate), ''màr pál'' "fisherman" (''pál'' = to fish), ''màr pàlà ta:'' "a fisher of fish".

Laal does show traces of an old Adamawa-type noun-class system, but apart from loans, the forms do not appear to be cognate with the Adamawa system (Lionnet 2010).

===Pronouns===
====Personal====
In the following tables, note the distinction between [[clusivity|inclusive and exclusive we]], found in many other languages but not [[English language|English]], and the gender differentiation of "I" in certain forms.  The inanimate plural has been dropped by most popular younger speakers in favour of the animate plural, but both are given below. The object paradigm for verbs is quite complex; only two of its several sets of [[allomorph]]s are given in the table below. "He" and "she" are used only for human referents; other nouns take the neuter pronoun. Tgat is quite distinct from the languages with which Laal shares vocabulary, but Laal has traces of an old Adamawa-type noun-class system (Lionnet 2010). The first- and second-person plural forms are quite similar to Chadic languages (specifically, [[Kera language|Kera]]) which are currently quite distant from the Laal-speaking region, but they have no similarities to Adamawa.

====Interrogative====
''jé'' "what?", ''ɟè'' "who?", ''ɗé'' "where?", ''sɨ̀g'' "how much?".

===Prepositions===
[[Preposition]]s precede their objects: ''gɨ̀ pə:l'' "in(to) the village", ''kɨ́ jà:ná'' "to his body" (="to near him").

===Verbs===
The verb does not vary according to the person or gender of the subject, but some verbs (about a quarter of the verbs attested) vary according to its number: ''no kaw'' "the person eats", ''mùáŋ kɨw'' "the people eat". The plural form of the verb is hard to predict, but is often formed by ablaut (typically raising the vowel height) with or without a suffix ''-i(ɲ)'' or ''-ɨɲ'' and tonal change.  The verb, however, changes according to the [[direct object]]. It takes personal suffixes to indicate a pronominal [[direct object]], and it commonly changes when a non-pronominal direct object is added to a [[transitive verb|transitive]] form with final low tone (formed similarly to the "centripetal", for which see below): ''ʔà ná ká'' "he will do"; ''ʔà ná kàrà mɨ́ná'' "he will do something"; ''ʔà kú na:ra'' "he sees the man"; ''ʔà kúù:rùúŋ'' "he sees you (pl.)".

The verb has three basic forms: simple, "centripetal", and "participative" to [[calque]] Boyeldieu's terminology. The simple form is used in the simple [[present tense]] or the [[imperative mood|imperative]]: ''ʔà duàg jə́w gə̀m'' "he goes down the riverbank" (lit. "he descend mouth riverbank"). The "centripetal" indicates action "hither", either spatially, motion towards the speaker, or temporally, action up to the present moment; it is formed mainly by suffixing a vowel (often, but not always, identical to the last vowel in the word): ''ʔà duàgà jə́w gə̀m'' "he comes down the riverbank (towards me)". The "participative", generally formed like the centripetal but with final high tone, generally indicates an omitted object or instrument: ''ʔà sá ɗa:g ʔà sɨ̀rɨ́ su'' "he takes a [[calabash]] and drinks water with it" (lit. "he take calabash he drink-participative water").

Immediately before the verb, a particle may be placed to indicate forms other than a simple present tense; such particles include ''ná'' (pl. ''ní'') marking future tense, ''taá:/teé:'' (pl. ''tií:'') marking continuous action, ''wáa:'' (pl. ''wíi:'') marking motion, ''náa:'' (pl. ''níi:'') being apparently a combination of ''ná'' and ''wáa:'', ''mà'' (pl. ''mì'') meaning "must", ''mɨ́'' marking reported speech (apparently an [[evidential]]), ''mɨ́nà'' (pl. ''mínì'') expressing intention, ''kò'' marking habitual action, ''ɓə́l'' or ''ga'' (pl. ''gi'') marking incomplete action, and ''wó'' (always accompanied by ''ʔàle'' after the verb) meaning "maybe".

Mediopassives (see [[passive voice]], [[middle voice]]) can be formed from [[transitive verbs]] by adding a suffix ''-↑ɨ́ɲ'': ''no siár sà:b'' "someone ripped the cloth" &gt; ''sà:b sérɨ́ɲ'' "the cloth ripped".  For the inverse, forming transitive verbs from [[intransitive]]s, changes in tone or to the plural sometimes occur.

[[Verbal noun]]s can sometimes be formed, mainly from intransitives, by the addition of a suffix -(vowel)''l'', sometimes with [[ablaut]] and tone change: '"wal'' "fall" &gt; ''wàlál'' "a fall", ''sùbá'' "lie" &gt; ''sɨ́blál'' (pl. ''súbɨ̀r'') "a lie".  The ''l'' becomes ''n'' near a nasal and ''r'' near ''r'': ''man'' "taste good", ''manan'' "a good taste".

====Adjectives====
Adjectives do not seem to constitute an independent category in Laal; to all intents and purposes, they behave just like verbs: ''gò: ʔì:r'' "the goat is black".  Attributively, they are typically linked as a [[relative clause]]: ''gò: má ʔì:r'' "the black goat" (literally "goat which black".)

===Numbers===
Numbers include ''ɓɨ̀dɨ́l'' "one", ''ʔisi'' "two", ''ɓisan'' "four". No other numbers are given specifically in the works so far published.

===Adverbs===
Adverbs generally come at the end of the clause. Here are some important adverbs:

Adverbs of location:
* "here": ''ɗágàl, núŋú''
* "there": ''ɗaŋ''
* "over there, yonder": ''ɗàŋá''

Temporal adverbs:
* "day before yesterday": ''tá:r''
* "yesterday": ''ʔiè:n''
* "today": ''cicam'', ''tari-màá''
* "recently": ''bèrè''
* "soon": ''sugo''
* "tomorrow": ''jìlí-kà:rì''
* "day after tomorrow": ''miàlgà''

===Modals===
Here are the most important modals:

*Before the verb: ''mɨ́'' "(say) that", ''gàná'' "then"
*After the verb: ''wó'' "not", ''(ʔà)le'' "maybe", ''ɓə́l'' "again", ''ʔá'' or ''gà'' "already", ''à'' [[interrogative]], ''wá'' [[Phrasal exclamation|exclamatory]], ''ta'' "now", ''cám'' "again, anew".

===Conjunctions===
Conjunctions can be divided into five types:

* only [[main clause]] - [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] - [[subordinate clause]]}: ''mɨ́'' "(say) that", ''ɓə'' "because"
* either {main clause - conjunction - subordinate clause} or {conjunction - subordinate clause - main clause}: ''ɟò'' "if", ''dànngà'' (possibly from Baguirmian) "when"
* circumposed: either {conjunction - main clause - conjunction - subordinate clause} or {conjunction - subordinate clause - conjunction - main clause}: ''ɟò... gàná'' "if"
* [[coordinate clause]] - conjunction - coordinate clause: ''ní'' "then afterwards", ''ku'' "then", ''kó'' "nonetheless", ''á'' or ''ná'' "and", ''ɓe:'' "or", ''ʔàmá'' (from Arabic or Baguirmian) "but".
* circumposed: conjunction - coordinate clause - conjunction - coordinate clause: ''ku... ku'' "then", ''jàn... jàn'' "both... and".

==Sample sentences==
*''mùáŋ lá tií: kìrì jé?'' "What do the people of Gori do?" (lit. "people Gori progressive-plural do-plural-transitive what?")
*''mùáŋ lá tií: pál.'' "The people of Gori fish." (lit. "people Gori progressive-plural fish.")
*''màr-ce ɓɨ́lá mɨ́ "bɨ̀là, ʔò teé: ɗɨ̀grɨ̀r".'' "The farmer said 'No way!  You're tricking me.'" (lit. "man+who-cultivate say that no-way you progressive trick-me".)
* ''ɟá ná wùsù na pè:rí ní ʔárí ʔò ná kìnì jé?'' "If/When I take out the snake, what will you give me?" (lit. "I (masc.) will take+out-transitive for-you (sing.) snake then first you give-me-transitive what?")
* ''jà kàskàr mà mùáŋ lá sə̀ɲə́ be.'' "It's with swords that the people of Gori fight." (lit. "with swords emphatic (inan.) people Gori fight-participative battle.")

A '''lagometer''' is a display of [[Latency (engineering)|network latency]] on an Internet connection and of rendering by the client. Lagometers are commonly found in computer games or [[IRC]] where timing plays a large role. [[Quake (series)|Quake]] and derived games commonly have them.

Advanced lagometer consists of two lines - bottom and top. The bottom line advances one pixel per each snapshot received from server (by default they are being sent at 20 snapshots per second rate), while the top one advances one pixel per each frame that is rendered by client. Thus, if the machine framerate was 20 per second, both lines - top and bottom - would run at the same speed.

Bottom bars correspond to delay before sending a snapshot by a server and receiving it by a client (so called "ping"). The shorter the bar, the smaller the ping was. Red bars mean that the frame has not arrived on time, yellow ones - that the snapshot was suppressed to stay under the rate limit.
Top bars can be drawn in blue or in yellow. While server snapshots are usually received at lower rate as the client framerate, the software interpolates position and movements until it gets an update from a server, when it adjusts own state accordingly.
The height of upper bars is proportional to the interpolated time between snapshots received (so as long as they come regularly, it stays below the "zero line" and is drawn in blue), or - if snapshots stop to arrive on time - is extrapolated after the last snapshot expected (then bars cross the "zero line" and are drawn in yellow).
If those bars stay yellow for too long, client is forced to interpolate its frames beyond the "reasonable level" and finally, when the snapshot arrives, the prediction turns out to hardly correspond to the server-side version, which results in a jerky, noncontinuous movement of scenery (obviously lowering the quality of gameplay).

Some games that use a "lagometer" will simply remove a player from the game if their lag is too high.
In the game Minecraft, the lagometer is displayed on the debug menu, as a line graph that will go up when lag spikes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5630">''Rajyasamacharam'' was the first newspaper in Malayalam. This was started for religious propagation by [[Hermann Gundert]] under the Christian missionaries of Basel Mission in June 1847 from Illikkunnu in [[Thalassery]]. ''Pashchimodayam'' was the second newspaper in Malayalam. It started in October 1847 from Thalasseri. ''[[Deepika (newspaper)|Deepika]]'', the oldest Malayalam newspaper now in circulation, was established in 1887. ''[[Malayala Manorama]]'', ''[[Madhyamam]]'', ''[[Mathrubhumi]]'', ''[[Deshabhimani]]'', ''[[Kerala Kaumudi]]'' and ''[[Janayugom]]'' are the other major newspapers in Malayalam. ''Malayala Manorama'' holds the record for the largest selling regional language newspaper in India. It is also the 11th [[List of newspapers by circulation|most circulating newspaper in the world]].

'''Maasina Fulfulde''' (or '''Maasinankoore''' in the language itself) is a [[Fula language]] spoken primarily as a first language by [[Fula people]] and associated groups in the [[Inner Niger Delta]] area traditionally known as Macina in the center of what is now the West African state of [[Mali]]. It is also spoken elsewhere in Mali, parts of [[Cote d'Ivoire]] and Northern [[Ghana]]. 

Maasinankoore is the most widely spoken dialect of Fula spoken in Mali and is a [[national language]] of the country.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

According to ''Ethnologue'' there are two dialects - Western and Eastern - and "There are some dialect differences, but popular opinion is that all dialects in Mali are inherently intelligible."

It is written in a modified [[Latin alphabet]] but historically was written in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] script.

==Linguistic features==

{{main|Fula language}}

Maasina Fulfulde is grammatically basically the same as other varieties of Fula, with some particularities. For instance there are some slight differences in some verb endings. &lt;!--need to put these into a table--&gt;

The counting system retains an interesting recapitulation of older systems historically used by other groups in what is now Mali. Tens from 60-90 have alternative versions not used in other varieties of Fula. In the table the general form, which would be understood by any Fulaphone person (basically counting by tens) and Maasina variant:

{| class="wikitable" 	 
!#!!General form!!Maasina variant 
|- 	 
|60 || ''cappanɗe jeegon'' || ''mali hemere''
|- 	 
|70 || ''cappanɗe jeeɗɗi'' || ''mali hemere e sappo''
|- 	 
|80 || ''cappanɗe jeetti'' || ''hemere bambara''
|- 	 
|90 || ''cappanɗe jeenayi'' || ''hemere bambara e sappo'' 
|}

A progressive verbal expression is formed by inserting the word ''ni'' before the verb in the non-accomplished voice. For example, ''omo ni wara'' = s/he is coming (right now). &lt;!--need to verify that this is the best way to explain and that this is not used in other dialects--&gt;

==Particularities of greetings==
As in other varieties of [[Fula language|Fula]], common greetings in Maasinankoore relate to the time of day. In addition to the standard Fula response - ''jam tan'' (lit., "peace only") - one may also respond ''jam ni'' (lit., peace here) or ''sago men tan'' (var. ''sago meɗen tan''; lit. "our [incl.] wish only"). 

A common general greeting is ''saɗi'' (when addressed to more than one person, ''caɗee''; lit. it's difficult or rare or dear). The standard response to this is ''a hisii'' (lit., you have escaped danger).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3792">The '''Ministry of Stories''' is a non-profit organisation in East London dedicated to helping children and young adults develop writing skills and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.

==Overview==
Located in [[Hoxton]], a district in the [[London Borough of Hackney]], England, The Ministry of Stories was founded in 2010 by the British author [[Nick Hornby]] and co-directors Lucy Macnab and Ben Payne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ministry of Stories offers magical writing classes|first=Ben|last= East|work=The National| date=30 October 2011|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/ministry-of-stories-offers-magical-writing-classes|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company provides mentoring and advice to young writers, relying on the work of volunteer writers, teachers and artists. The MoS aims to inspire young people to transform their lives through creative writing. The company works closely with schools, supporting teachers, but also provides one-to-one mentoring for young people to enjoy imaginative stories, improve language skills, increase abilities in communication, and develop social and educational confidence.&lt;ref name=stratton&gt;{{cite news|first=Allegra | last=Stratton |title=Nick Hornby opens Ministry of Stories to get Britain's kids writing again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/18/nick-hornby-ministry-stories|work=The Guardian|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2012, 5,000 young people have taken part in activities sponsored by the MoS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10144">'''News analysis''' refers to the measurement of the various [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] and [[quantitative property|quantitative]] attributes of textual ([[unstructured data]]) news stories. Some of these attributes are: sentiment, relevance, and novelty. Expressing news stories as numbers and metadata permits the manipulation of everyday information in a mathematical and statistical way.

News analytics are usually derived through automated text analysis and applied to digital texts using elements from [[natural language processing]] and [[machine learning]] such as [[latent semantic analysis]], [[support vector machines]], "bag of words" among other techniques.

==Applications and strategies==
The application of sophisticated linguistic analysis to news and social media has grown from an area of research to mature product solutions since 2007. News analytics and news sentiment calculations are now routinely used by both buy-side and sell side in alpha generation, trading execution, risk management, and market surveillance and compliance. There is however a good deal of variation in the quality, effectiveness and completeness of currently available solutions.

A large number of companies use news analysis to help them make better business decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Tetlock, Paul C.,Does Public Financial News Resolve Asymmetric Information?(November 1, 2008). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1303612&lt;/ref&gt; Academic researchers have become interested in news analysis especially with regards to predicting stock price movements, [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] and traded volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty/Paul.Tetlock/papers/Tetlock-Investor_Sentiment-11_07.pdf |title=Paul Tetlock- Home |publisher=Mccombs.utexas.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=1153450 |title=The Impact of Credibility on the Pricing of Managerial Textual Content by Elizabeth A. Demers, Clara Vega :: SSRN |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1153450 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/3096/More_Than_Words_tetlock.pdf |format=PDF |title=More Than Words : Quantifying Language to Measure Firms' Fundamentals |publisher=Gsb.columbia.edu |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Provided a set of values such as sentiment and relevance as well as the frequency of news arrivals, it is possible to construct news sentiment scores  for multiple asset classes such as equities, Forex, [[fixed income]], and commodities. Sentiment scores can be constructed at various horizons to meet the different needs and objectives of high and low frequency trading strategies, whilst characteristics such as direction and volatility of asset returns as well as the traded volume may be addressed more directly via the construction of tailor-made sentiment scores. Scores are generally constructed as a range of values. For instance, values may range between 0 and 100, where values above and below 50 convey positive and negative sentiment, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northinfo.com/documents/313.pdf |format=PDF |title=Equity portfolio risk (volatility) estimation using market information and sentiment |publisher=Northinfo.com |accessdate=2015-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on such sentiment scores, it should be possible to generate a set of strategies useful for instance within investing, [[hedge (finance)|hedging]], and order execution.

=== Absolute return strategies ===
The objective of [[absolute return]] strategies is absolute (positive) returns regardless of the direction of the financial market. To meet this objective, such strategies typically involve opportunistic long and short positions in selected instruments with zero or limited market exposure. In statistical terms, absolute return strategies should have very low [[correlation]] with the market return. Typically, hedge funds tend to employ absolute return strategies. Below, a few examples show how news analysis can be applied in the absolute return strategy space with the purpose to identify alpha opportunities applying a [[market neutral]] strategy or  based on volatility trading.

'''Example 1'''

'''Scenario:''' The gap between the news sentiment scores for direction, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, of Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and Market &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has moved beyond &lt;math&gt;+20&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;S_X-S_Y&lt;/math&gt; ≥ &lt;math&gt;20&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Action:''' Buy the stock on Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and short the future on Market &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exit Strategy:''' When the gap in the news sentiment scores for direction of Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and Market &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has disappeared, &lt;math&gt;S_X-S_Y&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, sell the stock on Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and go long the future on Market &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; to close the positions.

'''Example 2'''

'''Scenario:''' The news sentiment score for volatility of Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; goes above &lt;math&gt;70&lt;/math&gt; out of &lt;math&gt;100&lt;/math&gt; indicating an expected volatility above the option [[implied volatility]].

'''Action:''' Buy a short-dated straddle (the purchase of both a put and a call) on the stock of Company 
&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exit Strategy:''' Keep the straddle on Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; until expiry or until a certain profit target has been reached.

=== Relative return strategies===
The objective of [[relative return]] strategies is to either replicate ([[passive management]]) or outperform ([[active management]]) a theoretical passive reference portfolio or benchmark. To meet these objectives such strategies typically involve long positions in selected instruments. In statistical terms, relative return strategies often have high correlation with the market return. Typically, mutual funds tend to employ relative return strategies. Below, a few examples show how news analysis can be applied in the relative return strategy space with the purpose to outperform the market applying a stock picking strategy and by making tactical tilts to ones [[asset allocation]] model.

'''Example 1'''

'''Scenario:''' The news sentiment score for direction of Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; goes above &lt;math&gt;70&lt;/math&gt; out of &lt;math&gt;100&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Action:''' Buy the stock on Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Exit Strategy:''' When the news sentiment score for direction of Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; falls below &lt;math&gt;60&lt;/math&gt;, sell the stock on Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to close the position.

'''Example 2'''

'''Scenario:''' The news sentiment score for direction of Sector &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; goes above &lt;math&gt;70&lt;/math&gt; out of &lt;math&gt;100&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Action:''' Include Sector &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; as a tactical bet in the asset allocation model.

'''Exit Strategy:''' When the news sentiment score for direction of Sector &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; falls below &lt;math&gt;60&lt;/math&gt;, remove the tactical bet for Sector &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; from the asset allocation model.

===Financial risk management===
The objective of [[financial risk management]] is to create economic value in a firm or to maintain a certain risk profile of an investment portfolio by using financial instruments to manage risk exposures, particularly [[credit risk]] and [[market risk]]. Other types include Foreign exchange, Shape, Volatility, Sector, Liquidity, Inflation risks, etc. As a specialization of risk management, financial risk management focuses on when and how to [[hedge]] using financial instruments to manage costly exposures to risk. Below, a few examples show how news analysis can be applied in the financial risk management space with the purpose to either arrive at better risk estimates in terms of [[Value at Risk]] (VaR) or to manage the risk of a portfolio to meet ones portfolio mandate.

'''Example 1'''

'''Scenario:''' The bank operates a VaR model to manage the overall market risk of its portfolio.

'''Action:''' Estimate the portfolio covariance matrix taking into account the development of the news sentiment score for volume. Implement the relevant hedges to bring the VaR of the bank in line with the desired levels.

'''Example 2'''

'''Scenario:''' A portfolio manager operates his portfolio towards a certain desired risk profile.

'''Action:''' Estimate the portfolio [[covariance matrix]] taking into account the development of the news sentiment score for volume. Scale the portfolio exposure according to the targeted risk profile.

===Algorithmic order execution===
The objective of algorithmic order execution, which is part of the concept of [[algorithmic trading]], is to reduce trading costs by optimizing on the timing of a given order.  It is widely used by hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds, and other institutional traders to divide up large trades into several smaller trades to manage market impact, [[opportunity cost]], and risk more effectively. The example below shows how news analysis can be applied in the algorithmic order execution space with the purpose to arrive at more efficient algorithmic trading systems.

'''Example 1'''

'''Scenario:''' A large order needs to be placed in the market for the stock on Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Action:''' Scale the daily volume distribution for Company &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; applied in the algorithmic trading system, thus taking into account the news sentiment score for volume. This is followed by the creation of the desired trading distribution forcing greater market participation during the periods of the day when volume is expected to be heaviest.

==Effects==
Being able to express news stories as numbers permits the manipulation of everyday information in a statistical way that allows computers not only to make decisions once made only by humans, but to do so more efficiently. Since market participants are always looking for an edge, the speed of computer connections and the delivery of news analysis, measured in milliseconds, have become essential.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1962">The '''noticing hypothesis''' is a concept in [[second-language acquisition]] proposed by [[Richard Schmidt (linguist)|Richard Schmidt]] in 1990. He stated that learners cannot learn the grammatical features of a [[language]] unless they notice them.&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Venkatagiri, John M. Levis "Phonological Awareness and Speech Comprehensibility: An Exploratory Study" Language Awareness.  Vol. 16, Iss. 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Noticing alone does not mean that learners automatically acquire language; rather, the hypothesis states that noticing is the essential starting point for acquisition. There is debate over whether learners must consciously notice something, or whether the noticing can be subconscious to some degree.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, P.-M. and Spada, N.(2006). Explaining second language learning. ''How Languages are Learned'' p. 29-50, p. 44f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The noticing hypothesis has received criticism from John Truscott, on two grounds. First, he argues that the basis for the noticing hypothesis in [[cognitive psychology]] is unclear. Second, he argues that there is even less certainty over how to interpret the noticing hypothesis in the field of [[language acquisition]]. He says that, "[p]artly because the hypothesis is not based on any coherent theory of language, it is very difficult to determine exactly what it means in this context, or to draw testable predictions from it."&lt;ref name="Truscott1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Truscott|first=John|title=Noticing in second language acquisition: a critical review|url=http://www.hss.nthu.edu.tw/~fl/faculty/John/Noticing%201998.pdf|journal=Second Language Research|volume=14|issue=2|year=1998|pages=103–135|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truscott argues that the noticing hypothesis should be limited to describing [[metalinguistic knowledge]] and not overall language competence.&lt;ref name="Truscott1998" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="69796">{{Old Norse topics}}
[[Old Norse]] has three categories of verbs (strong, weak, &amp; present-preterite) and two categories of nouns (strong, weak). Conjugation and declension are carried out by a mix of [[inflection]] and two [[Nonconcatenative morphology|nonconcatenative]] morphological processes: [[Old Norse#Umlaut|umlaut]], a [[backness]]-based alteration to the [[root vowel]]; and [[Old Norse#Ablaut|ablaut]], a replacement of the root vowel, in verbs.

Nouns, adjectives and pronouns are [[declension|declined]] in four grammatical cases – [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]] and [[Dative case|dative]], in singular and plural. Some pronouns (first and second person) have [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] in addition to singular and plural. The nouns have three [[grammatical gender]]s – masculine, feminine or neuter - and adjectives and pronouns are declined to match the gender of nouns. The genitive is used [[Partitive case|partitively]], and quite often in compounds and [[kennings]] (e.g.: ''[[Urðarbrunnr]]'', the well of Urðr; ''[[Lokasenna]]'', the gibing of Loki). Most declensions (of nouns and pronouns) use ''-a'' as a regular genitive plural ending, and all declensions use ''-um'' as their dative plural ending.

All neuter words have identical nominative and accusative forms,{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = Grammar reference: Neuter nouns}} and all feminine words have identical nominative and accusative plurals.{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc = Grammar reference: Feminine nouns}}

The gender of some words' plurals does not agree with that of their singulars, such as ''lim'' and ''mund''.&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc  = p.389, LIM; p.437, MUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphophonology==
{{See also|Morphophonology|Bleeding order}}

Conditioned [[sound change]]s can cause some forms of a word to mismatch, or match in some words but not others. When speakers can't determine these conditions, but the effects remain, they are re-analyzed by speakers as rules for changing sounds during inflection, the ''[[morphophonology]]'' of the language. In this way, the history of a language affects its speakers.

===During Proto-Germanic===
{{See also|Proto-Germanic#Evolution of Proto-Germanic|l1=Evolution of Proto-Germanic}}

[[Verner's law]] shifted Proto-Germanic /*h/ &gt; /*g/ after an unstressed syllable. Afterwards, stress shifted to the first syllable in all words.&lt;ref name=NordicLanguages202&gt;{{harvnb|Bandle | Braunmüller|Elmevik|Jahr|2005|loc = 202. The typological development of the Nordic languages I: Phonology, § 1. Proto-Nordic, p.1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many Old Norse verbs, a lost /g/ reappears in the forms of some verbs, which makes their morphology abnormal, but remain regular because the forms containing /g/s are the same for each verb they appear in.
:ex.: Proto-Germanic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/slahaną|*slōhúm]]'' &gt; ''*slōgúm'' (we struck) had an unstressed first syllable, but the corresponding singular, ''*slṓh'' (I struck), had only a stressed syllable. These became Old Norse ''[[wikt:slá#Old Norse|slógum]]'' and ''sló''.&lt;ref name=NordicLanguages202/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:1&lt;/sup&gt;

===Before Old Norse===
{{See also|Old Norse#Umlaut|l1=Old Norse umlaut}}

[[Germanic umlaut|Umlaut]] was originally an [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of [[root vowel]]s to suffixes having the front phonemes /i, j/ (i-umlaut) and the back phonemes /u, w/ (u-umlaut) in Proto-Germanic. The suffixes were not on all forms of the same words, so when the suffixes underwent [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]] during the transition into Old Norse, the remaining umlaut of the vowel indicated what the suffix had before. From then on speakers would alternate the vowel as an act of inflection.

==Verbs==
{{See also|Germanic verb|Subjunctive mood#Other Germanic languages|l2=Germanic subjunctive}}

Verbs are [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] in person and number, in present and past tense, in indicative, imperative and [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] [[grammatical mood|mood]]. There are elements of repetition and minor variation in the inflections, but the type of verb also determines which patterns are present. The subjunctives show the largest and widest spread pattern among the inflections, with both strong and weak classes ending subjunctives (past and present) with ek/þú/þat -a/-ir/-i, vér/þér/þau -im/-ið/-i, except for a minor variation in the 3rd, 4th and 5th strong conjugations.

The active participle is used to form a [[gerund]] or a verbal noun&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|p=xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; with weak masculine singulars but strong masculine plurals in ''r'',&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt; or else with weak neuter declension. As a plain participle, it is a weak adjective.&lt;ref group="cv" name="xxweak"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc=p.xx "Remarks on the Weak Declension"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participle appears in two genders within the same verse in [[Hávamál]]: "gínanda úlfi / galandi kráku."{{sfn|Bray|1908|loc=p.84, verse 84(83)}} The general sense of the noun is of the English suffix ''-er'' or of being able to perform the action.&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|p=xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plural as a prefix, ''ęndr-'', is equivalent to the English and Latin prefix ''re-''.

The case of the object of an Old Norse verb is [[Lexical assignment|lexically assigned]], meaning that the case is determined on a per-verb basis. Most verbs take an accusative object, but some, such as ''gefa'' (give) have primary and secondary objects in the accusative and dative, while still others have nominative, genitive, or dative direct objects.

===Strong verbs===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
{{See also|Germanic strong verb}}

Strong verbs, unlike weak verbs, are conjugated by [[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]], a process that replaces, rather than modifies, their [[root vowel]]. The English ''sing'' uses ablaut to conjugate to ''sang'' in the past tense and ''sung'' as the past participle. Like weak verbs, strong verbs use inflections and [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], but they rely on them much less to distinguish forms and conjugations. While the strongs' umlaut and [[inflection]]al patterns are largely the same from verb to verb, there are different sets and numbers of vowels involved in ablaut, and so their patterns are used to classify the strong conjugations.

If there are 2 vowels in the pattern (as in the 6th &amp; some 7th conjugation patterns), the 2nd is used for all the past forms. If there are 3, the 2nd vowel is used for the indicative past singulars, &amp; the 3rd for the other past tenses. The 1st vowel is used for the remaining forms: the [[infinitive]], present forms, and [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and usually the past participle of 3-vowel words. However, some 3-vowel words have a 4th vowel appearing only in the participle.

The past participle of strong verbs follows the pronominal declension of ''[[#Hit|hit]]'',&lt;ref name="CleasbyRemAdj" group="cv"/&gt; though unlike the definite suffix the participle is inherited from [[Germanic strong verb|Proto-Germanic]].

The 3rd, 4th and 5th conjugations have an ''i'', rather than an ''a'', in the 1st person subjunctive past ending. Third conjugation words ending in ''n, g,'' or ''k'' have a ''u'' for their past participles' root vowel. The ''ja''s of the 3rd conjugation are due to [[Vowel breaking|breaking]]. The 4th and 5th conjugations are identical except in the past participle, where the 4th conjugation normally has ''o'' and the fifth conjugation ''e''. Generally, 3rd conjugation stems have two consonants following the vowel; 4th conjugation stems have a single [[sonorant]] consonant (''l, r, m'' or ''n'') following the vowel; and 5th conjugation stems have a single consonant that is not a sonorant.

====Verbs in ''-ra''====

The ''-ra'' conjugation consists of strong verbs with weak preterites&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;{{harvnb|Sweet|1895}}{{pn|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that use an ''r'' rather than a dental in their inflection. These arose as contractions of [[reduplicated]] verbs.{{sfn|Old Norse Online|loc= Lesson 1, § 4.1. Strong Verb Classes}} They correspond to modern Icelandic [[ri-verbs]]. When the pre-contraction form of the verb contained a velar, it persisted in the past indicative plurals, past subjunctives, and past participle, and the verb assumed the characteristics (ablaut, inflection) of normal strong conjugation. Alternate, regularized past-tenses for these were also in use in some dialects, with an ''-ø-r'' or ''-e-r'' format.&lt;ref name="sla" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc =pp.566-7, Slá}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs like ''kjósa'' and ''snúa'' follow the ''ú/jú/jó, au, u, (o)'' ablaut pattern, and verbs like ''slá'' follow the ''a, ó'' ablaut.&lt;ref group="cv" name="xxv3"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = pp.xxv-xxvi, "3: The Verbs with the Preterite in ''-ra''"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of ''slá'' without the ''g'' have absorbed said consonant, lengthening the vowel in the process. When this [[Phonological process|process]] is taken into account, the conjugation can be seen as that of a regular verb with an ''a, ó'' ablaut pattern. The ''-ø-r'' past tense forms were used in some dialects, with ''sløri'' and ''sløru'' as attested forms, but was rare in writing.&lt;ref name="sla" group="cv"/&gt;&lt;ref  group="cv" name="xxv3"/&gt;

===Weak verbs===
{{See also|Germanic weak verb}}

Weak verbs distinguish the tenses of the indicative and subjunctive primarily by adding a suffix with a dental (t, d, or ð). This is the primary mode of distinction of tenses, in contrast with the [[Root (linguistics)|radical]] vowel changes characteristic of the strong verbs. Preceded by the dental, the subjunctive past tense endings take the form of their present tense endings, changing the inflectional vowel to ''i'' in the plural. The indicative forms take the subjunctive forms, changing the inflectional vowel to ''u'' in the plural. The dental is preceded by an ''a'' in some verbs, causing the past tenses to become trisyllabic.

There are three primary conjugations, corresponding approximately to the first three classes of weak verbs in [[Gothic language#Weak verbs|Gothic]]. The Proto-Germanic and Gothic Class IV weak verb, with a ''*-n(ō)-'' suffix, has been incorporated into the second conjugation in Old Norse.

====First conjugation====
The first weak conjugation has an ''-i/j-'' suffix, which triggers i-umlaut of the stem. As in other Germanic languages, there are two subclasses, depending on whether the stem is short (consisting of a short vowel followed by at more one consonant) or long (containing a long vowel or diphthong, or followed by two or more consonants). The differences are due to [[Sievers' law]], which caused the suffix to assume the form ''*-j-'' after short syllables but ''*-ij-'' after long syllables. The long ''*-ij-'' suffix subsequently disappeared when followed by a vowel that remained in Old Norse (except after ''k'', ''g'' or a vowel, as in ''fylgja'' "to follow"), but betrays its former presence by i-umlauting the stem syllable.&lt;ref group="cv" name="xxiv2"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = p.xxiv, "Weak Verbs, Remarks on the 2nd Conjugation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the stem was directly followed by a consonant, it was vocalized, becoming ''*-i-'' after short syllables and ''*-ī-'' after long syllables. Short ''*-i-'' was lost early on in many circumstances, before the operation of i-umlaut; as a result, short-stem verbs lack i-umlaut in the indicative past and the past participle. Umlaut does occur in the subjunctive past of the short-stem verbs, either as a result of the ''-j/ī-'' that originally occurred in the subjunctive endings or by analogy with the strong verbs. (Contrast Gothic, where the ''-i-'' stem is still preserved, and [[Old English]], where i-umlaut operated early enough that all first-weak verbs, both short and long, have consistent i-umlaut throughout the paradigm.)

Many 2nd conjugation verbs are derived by i-umlaut of the second ablaut form of a strong verb, often serving as a causal equivalent to it. (This derives directly from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] causative-iterative construction.) For example, ''br'''ę'''nna — to make burn'' derives from ''brenna/brinna (ek br'''a'''nn, þau brunnu) — to burn; be burning''.&lt;ref group="cv" name="xxiv2"/&gt; The ''-ing'' &amp; ''-ingr'' suffixes are added to a finite form of some of these verbs to derive feminine and masculine nouns from them.&lt;ref name="ProseReader3"/&gt; The ''-ning'' &amp; ''-ningr'' can also be used to derive feminine and masculine nouns in short-stem verbs, and are added to a non-umlauted form of the verbs, e.g. ''spurning'' "a question" from ''spyrja'' "to ask".&lt;ref name="ProseReader3"/&gt;

====Second conjugation====
The second conjugation is marked by a consistent ''-a-'' suffix, with no i-umlaut. It contains a class of derivates with characteristic suffixes: [[Inchoative verb|inchoatives]] in ''-na'', such as ''vakna'';&lt;ref name="LehmannSlocum"/&gt; causals in ''-ga'' from adjectives in ''-igr''; causals in ''-ka''; iteratives in ''-sa''; verbs in ''-la'', a kind of diminutive; and verbs in ''-ja'', ''-va'', and ''-ra''.&lt;ref group="cv" name="xxiv1"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = p.xxiv, "Weak Verbs, Remarks on the 1st Conjugation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''-n'' suffix is applied to the infinitive of some of these verbs to derive feminine nouns from them.&lt;ref name="ProseReader3"&gt;{{harvnb|Vigfússon|Powell|1879|loc= Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inflections containing ''ǫð'' (see table) may spell and pronounce the ''ǫ'' as a reduced ''u'' or an ''a'' depending on the dialect.

====Third conjugation====
The third conjugation is generally marked by an ''-i-'' in the present tense, and no suffix in the past tense. This ''-i-'' does not trigger i-umlaut, as it derives from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*-ai-''. However, subjunctive preterites do have i-umlaut, either as a result of the ''*-j/ī-'' that originally occurred in the subjunctive endings or by analogy with the strong verbs.

===Present-preterite verbs===
{{See also|Preterite-present verb}}

Present-preterite, or present-in-past, verbs form their present tenses using the ablaut patterns of strong verbs' past tenses. Their past tenses are formed like weak verbs'.

===Suffixes and clitics===
{{Expand section|The personal suffix|date=August 2011}}
{{See also|Reflexive verb}}

The reflexive pronoun's accusative, ''sik'', is contracted and suffixed to the verb as ''-k, -sk, or -zk'' in order to form the reflexive suffix.&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1899|pp=336-338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = James | last = Hadley | first2 = George Lyman | last2 = Kittredge | authorlink2 = George Lyman Kittredge | title = A Brief History of the English Language| publisher = G. &amp; C. Merriam co.| year =  1913| quote =  [General Features of the Teutonic Languages...], § 20. Voices, ''"But for this ''s'' the Old Norse has ''sk'', which is plainly the reflexive pronoun ''sik'' (self, selves) shortened and added to the active verb."''}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suffix is often referred to as Old Norse's "[[middle voice]]." In the early 13th century, the suffixes became ''-z'' and ''-s'', and later ''-zt'' and ''-zst''.&lt;ref name="JohnsonEcyc"/&gt; As a middle voice, it can be thought of as passivizing an action without using passive voice syntax. This usage of reflexivity is paralleled in English with sentence pairs such as "he sat down" and "he sat himself down."

==Nouns==

Old Norse and other Germanic languages had two types of regular declension. They are called the strong and weak declensions by analogy with the strong and weak conjugations. These declensions are further subdivided into [[Word stem|stem]] classes: groups of nouns distinguished by the historical or present [[morphophonological]] characteristics that the nouns of each class's stems share(d). Their names take after their [[Proto-Germanic]] or [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ancestors, and refer to the suffixes present on those older nouns. Because umlaut was caused by these suffixes, there is a strong correlation between the phonetic characteristics of the suffix and the type of umlaut seen among stems of a class. Besides the latter classification, the stems may be grouped into the ''root noun, consonant stem,'' and ''vocalic stem'' declensions, in Proto-Germanic terms.

In Proto-Germanic, the neuter stems modeled their nominative/accusative ''singulars'' after masculine accusative singulars, while their nominative/accusative ''plurals'' were modeled after the nominative singular of the corresponding feminine declension.&lt;ref name="LehmannSlocum331"&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|Slocum|loc=§3.3.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Strong nouns===
{{Expand section|PGmc/PIE roots for stem classes; Masc. &amp; fem. ''i'' and ''r'' tables.|date=December 2009}}

Old Norse has 2 strong neuter declensions, and 3 strong masculine and feminine declensions. The masculine and feminine declensions may be referred to as the ''a'', ''i,'' and ''r'' declensions, after their nominative plural inflections of ''-ar'', ''-ir,'' and ''-r'', respectively.

Though the ''a''-declension masculines tend towards a genitive ''-s'', and the ''i-'' and ''r-''declension words towards ''-ar'', many words are found going against the norm. ''Grautr'', ''skógr'', and ''hǫfundr'', for example, are ''a''-declension nouns with ''-ar'' for a genitive singular. The ''-i'' of the dative singular is frequently dropped from many words, particularly in the ''i''-declension. Bisyllabic proper names in ''-arr'' (Einarr) or ''-urr'' (Gizurr) do not contract as ''hamarr'' does before an inflectional syllable, due to differing etymologies. The following words demonstrate two [[Proto-Indo-European noun#Athematic and thematic nouns|PIE ''o''-stem]] reflexes, one bisyllabic, a ''yo''-stem reflex, and an ''iyo''-stem reflex.&lt;ref name="LehmannSlocum"&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|Slocum| at =  Ch. III. Inflectional Morphology }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter stem type consists mainly of poetic words.&lt;ref name="CleasbyStrongN"  group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|pp= xvi-xviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the i-declension masculines are the wa-stem reflexes. These have a u-umlauted root caused by a radical ''v''.

The strong feminines descend from PIE ā stems.{{sfn|Lehmann|Slocum|at=§3.3}}  PIE ''-ā'' developed into PGmc. ''-ō'' and finally Proto-Norse ''-u,''&lt;ref name="LehmannSlocum331"/&gt; leading to the singulars of these words being u-umlauted under that inflection's influence. Their plurals are the same as those of the analogous masculine declension, except for the nominative and accusative being the same. The ending ''-ir'' of the i-stems, as in ''tíð'' - ''tíðir'', while not exemplified in the table below, is in fact more common in feminines than the ending of ō-stems ''-ar'', and has become increasingly so by analogy; thus the example ''gjǫf'' in the table in later texts replaces its old plural form ''gjafar'' with ''gjafir''. A dative singular ''u'' inflection is found in some nouns, most noticeably in the i-declension where it is sometimes accompanied by an accusative singular ''u''.&lt;ref name="CleasbyStrongN" group="cv"/&gt; Some nouns, prominently among nouns in the same declension as ''ęrmr'', carry a nominative singular ''r'' inflection;&lt;ref name="CleasbyStrongN" group="cv"/&gt; surprisingly, these are the descendants of the Proto-Germanic ''ijō''-stems (i.e. long ''jō''-stems, as opposed to the short counterpart seen below in the example ''Hęl''), which historically lacked that ending; it seems that they have acquired it through confusion with the i-stems such as ''tíð'', which did originally have it. Conversely, the i-stems have lost the nominative -r ending through analogy with ō-stem feminines.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{citation| last = Heusler| first =  Andreas | year =  1962 | title =  Altisländisches Elementarbuch|at =  Paragraph 214 }} ; For more citations and discussion, see also {{citation| url  =http://folk.uio.no/sverrej/publication_files/2005/dissertation/johnsen_mphil.dissertation.2005.pdf| year = 2005| title = The Germanic (i)jō-stem declension. Origin and development| first =  Sverre |last =  Johnsen |page = 62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, many nouns do not have any inflectional distinctions among the singulars except from the genitive. Under these circumstances the case system aligns with that of most English nouns. e.g.: "A mouse's (G) mouse (N) gave a mouse (A) to a mouse (D)."

The neuter declensions' genitive and dative mirror the masculine ''a'' declension's.&lt;ref name="LehmannSlocum331"/&gt; The nom./acc. plural is u-umlauted from the singulars, but this only alters nouns with ''a'' as their root, leaving number indistinct in many strong neuters for these cases. [[PGmc]] ''-ja'' stem reflexes, such as ''nęs'' and ''klæði,'' are umlauted without regard to [[Word stem|stem]] [[Syllable weight|weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Iverson | first =  Gregory K. |last2= Salmons | first2= Joseph C. |url =https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-germanic-linguistics/article/conundrum-of-old-norse-umlaut-sound-change-versus-crisis-analogy/643F5770E5E621C0685353CD763B1AE3/core-reader | title = The Conundrum of Old Norse Umlaut: Sound Change versus Crisis Analogy | journal = Journal of Germanic Linguistics| date = Mar 2004| volume = 16| issue =1 |doi  = 10.1017/S1470542704000364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak nouns===

One main feature of weak nouns is that they do not distinguish the non-nominative singular cases from each other. This effectively forms a [[Nominative case|nominative]]-[[oblique case]] dynamic confined to the weak singulars. Historically, the [[Proto-Germanic]] weak nouns were characterized by a nasal suffix applied as a case marker. These were mostly absorbed by their preceding vowels by the time Old Norse developed, with the main exceptions being those suffixes in the weak feminine and neuter declensions' genitive plurals.&lt;ref group="cv" name="xviii1"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc =p.xviii, "Weak Nouns: 1: Masculine"}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, weak nouns are referred to as the ''n stems'', a consonant stem class.

The plural inflection of the weak masculine declension is that same as the strong masculine ''a'' declension. The weak declension contains the endings -ingi and -yrki/-virki, as well as some weak versions of strong masculine nouns, names, and endings.&lt;ref group="cv" name="xviii1"/&gt;

The weak feminines with the ''-a'' ending vary greatly in the genitive plural, but most fall into a few groups: Nouns with ''-na'' as ending; nouns with no genitive plural; nouns that form the genitive plural by attaching the definite article's genitive plural to the nominative singular; nouns whose genitive singular is used [[Collective number|collectively]].&lt;ref  group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc =p.xviii, "Weak Nouns: 2: Feminine"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the nominative of neuter words is also the accusative, and as weak nouns have the same dative and genitive as accusative in the singulars, all of the singular forms are the same for the weak neuters. One subset of the neuter declension contains 6 nouns for parts of the body. Another contains words for objects, forming no genitive plural.&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc =p.xviii, "Weak Nouns:  4: Neuter"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indeclinable Feminines are an additional class of weak noun which originally had a [[word stem]] with the ending -in of which in Old Norse only the -i remains. They are conceptual in meaning, and because of this have no plurals and do not differentiate case.&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc =p.xviii, "Weak Nouns: 3: Remarks on the Indeclinable Feminine"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[:wikt:lygi|lygi]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.etymonline.com/word/lie#etymonline_v_9489| title = lie (n.1) | work = www.etymologyonline}} ; Etymology and cognates of the word "lie" in English.&lt;/ref&gt; "lie" however has a plural. They may, in charts, be included with the feminines in -a, in which case said chart becomes:

Pronouns and adjectives are generally separate in declension. However, in semantic and syntactic usage, the boundary is less clear-cut.{{sfn|Old Norse for Beginners|loc =Lesson 4}} Adjectives may be used as in English, to modify a noun (e.g., ''gótt vatn'', good water), or may stand alone as a de facto pronoun (e.g., ''gótt'', a good thing). The only difference in their declensions is the masculine accusative singular ending, which is ''-n'' in pronouns and ''-an'' in adjectives. Genitive and dative plurals are indistinct in gender for all pronominal and adjectival declensions. The nominative and accusative neuter singular ends in ''-t'' when the word's root vowel is short, and ''-tt'' when long.&lt;ref name="CleasbyRemAdj" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = p.xix, "Assimilation/Dropping"; p.xx, "Comparison, Definiteness"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronouns===

The interrogatives include ''hvat'' "what", ''hví'' "why", and ''hvess'' "what sort", derived from ''þat'', ''hvar'' "where" and ''hveim'' "whom", derived from ''þar'', ''hvárt'' "which of two, each," and hvęrt, "whether, which of many."

There are two relative particles, ''er'' or ''es'' and ''sem'', which can also be used as relative pronouns or adverbs. Both are completely indeclinable. The former carries the relative (non-interrogative) senses of the words ''which, who, when, where,'' and ''that''. The latter corresponds to ''as, as if, alike, same as,'' or ''about the same time as'', and may take on any function of ''er'' as well.

Some pronouns, such as hvárr,&lt;ref name="ZoegaH"&gt;{{harvnb|Zoëga|1910|loc=Letter H}}&lt;/ref&gt; hvęrt,&lt;ref name="ZoegaH"/&gt; nekkvęrt,&lt;ref group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = p.452, ''"[...] but nekkvert, nokkvort, nokkurt (answering to hvert), as an adjective."''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sá,&lt;ref name="UTON3"&gt;{{harvnb|Old Norse Online| loc= Lesson 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; have adjectival function. This usage generally requires a different translation than their pronominal one.

====Personal and possessive====

''Þat''&amp;#39;s singulars follow the pronominal declension irregularly, and with different [[Lemma (morphology)|lemmata]] for each gender. Its plurals follow the declension of the cardinal numbers irregularly, and are especially similar to ''tvau''&amp;#39;s forms. Variants of ''hánum'' include ''honum'' and ''hǫnum''.

For the 1st and 2nd person, actions with one's self as an object simply use ''mik, þik,'' etc. For the 3rd person, a separate reflexive pronoun is used, which follows the declension of the 1st and 2nd personal pronouns' singulars.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''Tvau'' "two" or ''bœði'' "both" may be used as substitute for a true 3rd personal dual.

The possessive pronouns are derived from the genitives of the personal pronouns. They are mitt, þitt, sitt, okkart, ykkart, várt, and yðart. The ''í'' of those derived from the singulars is shortened before ''nn'' or ''tt''.

===Adjectives===

The comparative and superlative forms are formed by inserting ''-r-'' and ''-st-'' or ''-ar-'' and ''-ast-'' between the uninflected form of the adjective and a strong or weak ending.&lt;ref name="CleasbyRemAdj" group="cv"/&gt; In the strong adjectives, the definite and superlative are strong when indefinite, weak when definite. The comparatives are weak when both definite and indefinite, and are declined like the active participle. Some strong adjectives i-umlaut their root vowel in their comparatives and superlatives, so that ''stórt hús'' (a large house) becomes ''stœrst'' (a house most large). The past participles of weak verbs decline as strong adjectives.

====Hit====

As the '''definite article''', ''hit'' appears before a definite adjective and suffixed to a noun.&lt;ref name="CleasbyHinn" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc =pp.262-3 "Hit/hinn/hin''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Double definiteness]] occurs when ''hit/hinn/hin'' or the other definite article, ''þat/sá/sú'', is used before a definite noun or adjective, e.g. "sá konungrinn," "inn hvíti."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first  =Jan Terje |last = Faarlund | authorlink = Jan Terje Faarlund |  title =  The syntax of Old Norse| year =2004| at = p.58, - Treating article + adjective as doubly definite}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of construction persists to some extent in all modern [[North Germanic languages]], though not generally in Icelandic.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last = Strahan | first =  Tania E. | volume = 31 | issue = 2 |date =  December 2008 |pages = 193-226 | title = Sjå på han mannen!

&lt;ref name=NordicLanguages178&gt;{{harvnb|Bandle | Braunmüller|Elmevik|Jahr|2005|loc = The standard languages and their systems in the 20th century IV: Swedish, p.1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.joensuu.fi/24SCL/Harries.pdf Determination and Double Definiteness in Faroese]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Merete | last = Anderssen| url = http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/nordlyd/article/viewFile/132/122 | title = The Acquisition of Compositional Definiteness in Norwegian |journal = Nordlyd | volume = 34 |number =3 | year = 2007 |pages = 252-75 | doi = 10.7557/12.132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Jorge |last = Hankamer  | first2 =  Line| last2=  Mikkelsen | title = Definiteness marking and the structure of Danish pseudopartitives | journal = Journal of Linguistics | volume =  44 | issue = 2 | date =July 2008| pages = 317-346| doi = 10.1017/S0022226708005148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When suffixed, it gives the nouns pronominal declension (like itself). The ''h'' is always dropped, and the root ''i'' is replaced by any vowel at the end of the noun.&lt;ref name="CleasbyRemAdj" group="cv"/&gt; The expected dative plural *''umnum'' is contracted to ''unum''.&lt;ref name="CleasbyRemAdj" group="cv"/&gt; In other uses, it can appear before an adverb, after a pronoun, between two nouns, or between an adjective and a pronoun (including another adjective).&lt;ref name="CleasbyHinn" group="cv"/&gt;

The ''hit'' originally appeared always as a separate word, ''hit/hinn/hin'', ''it/inn/in'', or ''et/enn/en'',&lt;ref name="CleasbyHinn" group="cv"/&gt; placed before or after a noun or adjective, with the /h/ [[elided]] due to the word appearing unstressed in most or all positions. In the late 14th century (particularly in Old Norwegian), an indeclinable form was popular, ''inu'' or ''hinu'', but at no other time.&lt;ref name="CleasbyHinn" group="cv"/&gt;

A related word, ''hitt'', should not be confused with ''hit'', as they are distinct in meaning and stress, and in that the ''h'' can never be dropped from ''hitt''.&lt;ref group="cv" group="cv"&gt;{{harvnb|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc = pp.263-4, "Hitt/hinn/hin"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strong declension===

''Jarpt'' demonstrates the general case for declension. ''Gótt'' displays dental assimilation, while ''nekkvęrt'' demonstrates pronominal declension. The comparative and superlative follow the weak declension.

===Weak declension and weak inflection of active participles===

The singulars of the weak adjectival declension are modelled after those of the weak noun declensions (-an- and -on-[[Stem (linguistics)|stem]]s), and likewise have a nominative-oblique case dynamic.

The [[active participle]] and [[comparative]] only have a weak declension and are in masculine and neuter modelled after the weak nouns with roots in -an-stems, but in feminine and plural modelled after the weak nouns with roots in -in-stems. The comparative form as in Latin, other Germanic languages etc. is also corresponding to the [[agent noun]]-ending, which in Old Norse has a weak declension with roots in -an-stem inflection as well.

The plurals are not distinguished in gender, nor in case except the dative.

===Indeclinable===
The indeclinable adjectives end in -i, -a or -s. They are not comparable. They originated either from regular weak adjectives, with the different endings marking gender; or adjectives with a noun ending in genitive plural or singular, as they originally were nouns.

===Numbers===

Eitt (one) follows the pronominal declension, and hundrað is a strong neuter noun.

''Tvau, bæði, þrjú,'' and ''fjǫgur'' have only plural, and their declension is given below. The background of the inflection ''tveimr'' and ''þrimr'' in the dative case as seen below is the Proto-Germanic noun and adjective [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] plural ending ''-maz'' and ''-miz''. Those endings are still used in contemporary Icelandic today. All other cardinal numbers are indeclinable.

The [[Distributive numeral|distributive]]s and [[English numerals|multiplicatives]] are all strong adjectives. The [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal]]s are weak, except for ''annat'' "the second", which is strong and ''fyrst'' "the first", which can be both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">'''''Posse mit Gesang''''' ("farce with singing", plural: Possen) is a form of popular [[German language|German-language]] music drama, that developed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Early examples are sometimes called 'Possenspil' or 'Possenspiel'. It is also sometimes referred to simply as 'Posse' (farce).

Associated with [[Vienna]], and also [[Berlin]] and [[Hamburg]], the Posse mit Gesang was similar to the [[Singspiel]], but generally had more action and less music than the more [[opera]]tic form. Viennese examples included [[Ferdinand Raimund]]'s ''Der Alpenkönig und der Menschenfeind'' of 1828 and many of the works of [[Johann Nestroy]]. Composers who contributed music for Posse included [[Wenzel Müller]], [[Conradin Kreutzer]], and Philip Jakob Riotte. 

Some 20th-century examples of posse written by [[Walter Kollo]] were ''[[Filmzauber]]'' (1912) and ''[[Wie einst im Mai (operetta)|Wie einst im Mai]]'' (1913). 

More specialized examples of the genre were 'Lokalposse' (daily life themes), 'Zauberposse' (magic), 'Charakterposse' (personalities), 'Situationsposse' (situations), and 'Parodierende Posse' (parodies).

==Other examples of Posse mit Gesang==
*1820: ''[[Die Zwillingsbrüder]]'' by [[Franz Schubert]], Vienna, [[Theater am Kärntnertor]]
*1826: ''Herr Josef und Frau Baberl'' by [[Wenzel Müller]], Vienna, [[Theater in der Leopoldstadt]] 
*1842: ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' by [[Johann Nestroy]] (text) and Adolf Müller (music)
*1889: ''Wiener Luft'' by [[Karl Michael Ziehrer]], Vienna, [[Theater an der Wien]]

==Main Writings==


===''The Rift in the Lute: Attuning Poetry and Philosophy''===
What is it for poetry to be serious and to be taken seriously? What is it to be open to poetry, exposed to its force, attuned to what it says and alive to what it does? These are important questions that call equally on poetry and philosophy. But poetry and philosophy, notoriously, have an ancient quarrel. Maximilian de Gaynesford sets out to understand and convert their mutual antipathy into something mutually enhancing, so that we can begin to answer these and
other questions. The key to attuning poetry and philosophy lies in the fact that poetic utterances are best appreciated as doing things. For it is as doing things that the speech act approach in analytic philosophy of language tries to understand all utterances. Taking such an approach, this book offers
ways to enhance our appreciation of poetry and to develop our understanding of philosophy. It explores work by a range of poets from Chaucer to Geoffrey Hill and J. H. Prynne, and culminates in an extended study of Shakespeare's Sonnets. What work does poetry set itself, and how does this determine the way it is to be judged? What do poets commit themselves to, and what they may be held responsible for? What role does a poet have, or their audience, or their context, in determining the meaning
of a poem, what work it is able to achieve? These are the questions that an attuned approach is able to ask and answer.

===''I: The Meaning of the First Person Term''===

The book ''I: The Meaning of the First Person Term'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2006) rejects the established view that ''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'' is a so-called ''Pure [[Indexical]]'', arguing that it is a [[Deixis|deictic]] term, and hence like the other singular [[personal pronouns]] (''[[You]]''; ''[[He]] / [[She]]'').

The established view, so the book argues, depends on three mutually supportive doctrines which turn out to be myths:
*''Rule Theory'': A simple rule is sufficient to give the meaning of ''I''.
*''Independence'': One can use ''I'' to express thoughts without having to identify what is being referred to.
*''The Guarantee'': The meaning of ''I'' logically guarantees any use of the term against failure to refer.

The radically new account of ''I'' (as a deictic term) depends on various kinds of evidence:
*''Logical Character'': The substitutional behaviour of ''I''-use is that of an obligatorily deictic term.
*''Inferential Role'': The inferential behaviour of ''I''-use is that of an obligatorily deictic term.
*''Referential Function'': The referential determinacy of ''I''-use is deictic: it depends on making an individual salient.
*''Expressive Use'': The discriminability of ''I''-use for the reference-maker is deictic: it depends on the referent's salience.
*''Communicative Role'': The discriminability of ''I''-use for the audience is deictic: it depends on the referent's salience.

This account has a major bearing on other areas of research: the meaning of ''I'' is used to elucidate the thoughts expressed by the term, and so helps account for difficult and controversial features of [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], [[practical reasoning]], belief-acquisition, and belief-ascription.

===''Hilary Putnam''===

A critical evaluation which reveals a basic unity in [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam’s]] work (''Hilary Putnam'', McGill-Queens University Press / Acumen, 2006), achieved through repeated engagements with a small set of hard problems, all of which stem from the need to account for the [[intentionality]] of thought and language.

===''John McDowell''===

A study (''John McDowell'', Blackwell / Polity Press, 2004) of [[John McDowell|McDowell's]] view that treating our fundamental relations with the world as problematic is a deep mistake, attributable to false views about nature, and that we should give proper weight to a natural fact about the world: that human beings are of a kind that is naturally placed within the natural order.

Although he took up writing at the relatively late age of forty-four, during the remainder of his life he wrote eclectically and copiously on a variety of social, scientific, biographical and historical subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ez4wAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Shripad+Mahadev+Mate&amp;dq=Shripad+Mahadev+Mate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjelvf2kpHXAhWKRo8KHb7jCXkQ6AEIMTAC |title=The Chitpavans: social ascendancy of a creative minority in Maharashtra, 1818-1918 |last=Gokhale |first=Sandhya |date=2008 |publisher=Shubhi Publications |isbn=9788182901322 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was deeply troubled by the social scourge of [[untouchability]] in contemporary India, and wrote several short stories as well as essays arguing for the abolition of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9ess-9bebEYC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=Shripad+Mahadev+Mate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjelvf2kpHXAhWKRo8KHb7jCXkQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Shripad%2520Mahadev%2520Mate&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopaedia of Dalits in India: Human rights : role of police and judiciary |date=2002 |publisher=Gyan Publishing House |isbn=9788178351285 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was a [[Brahmin]] by birth and retained a spiritual affinity for the cultural and religious tenets of Hinduism, his writings show his sustained scepticism towards many of its dogmas.

Mate was born in the town of [[Shirpur]] in [[Vidarbha]]. He went to New English School, [[Satara (city)|Satara]] and acquired his university education (up to an M.A.) in Pune. For a few years, he served as a teacher at the [[Nutan Marathi Vidyalaya]], [[Pune]] and later as a professor at [[Sir Parshurambhau College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5ZvZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Shripad+Mahadev+Mate&amp;dq=Shripad+Mahadev+Mate&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjelvf2kpHXAhWKRo8KHb7jCXkQ6AEIOTAE |title=South Asian Intellectuals and Social Change: A Study of the Role of Vernacular-speaking Intelligentsia |last=Malik |first=Yogendra K. |date=1981 |publisher=Heritage |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Madhukar Mate (born 1930) was an eminent archaeologist with expertise in medieval India. 
Mate presided over the [[Marathi Sahitya Sammelan]] at [[Sangli]] in 1943.
==Notable Literary works==
* रसवंतीची जन्मकथा (1943) discusses the birth and development of human languages on evolutionary principles. 
* संत-पंत-तंत (1957) is an overview of devotional poets (संतकवी), erudite poets (पंडितकवी) and bards (शाहीर) in the Marathi linguistic tradition. 
* उपेक्षितांचे अंतरंग (1941), अनामिका (1946), माणुसकीचा गहिवर (1949) and भावनांचे पाझर (1954) are some of his collections of short stories. A unifying thread through all of these stories is the compassionate portrayal of the lives of tribals and untouchable castes, such as महार, मांग, रामोशी and कातोडी. 
* साहित्यधारा (1943), विचार-शलाका (1950) and विचारमंथन (1962) contain argumentative essays on social and religious themes.
* परशुरामचरित्र (1937), गीतातत्त्वविमर्श (1957) and रामदासांचे प्रपंचविज्ञान (1960) contain his unorthodox interpretations of familiar mythological themes.

'''Motuna''' or '''Siwai''', also known as ''Telei, Rugara'', is a [[Papuan language]] of [[Bougainville Province]], [[Papua New Guinea]]. The current number of speakers is difficult to estimate since the latest figure (6,000 + 600) is from the 1970 census.&lt;ref name="Valency"&gt;Onishi, Masayuki (2000).

The structure of the language is CV(C), with the coda being an [[Phoneme#Neutralization and archiphonemes|archiphoneme]] realized as a glottal stop, glottal fricative, or a nasal (homorganic to the next consonant or velar if word-final).&lt;ref name="Valency"/&gt;{{rp|115}}

==Grammar==
Siwai is an agglutinating language that undergoes a substantial amount of morphophonological fusion. Heads and dependents are both marked. It shows case on NPs. It is ergative/absolutive. It shows extremely complex prefixation and suffixation in verbs, kinship terms, classifiers, and numerals. It tends to be verb-final, with A and O in either order. NPs can be omitted when understood from context.&lt;ref name="Valency" /&gt;{{rp|115}}

===Gender===
Siwai exhibits five genders: masculine, feminine, diminutive, local, and manner. These are marked in the singular forms only since dual and paucal forms are all marked like diminutive and plurals are marked like masculine. These genders coexist with fifty-one semantic types, marked by classifiers. These in turn are combined with numerals, demonstratives, and possessive pronouns.&lt;ref name="Valency" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

===Number===
The language has four numbers: singular, dual, [[Grammatical number#Paucal|paucal]], and plural. Nouns show all four while pronouns are either singular and non-singular. First-person non-singular shows a distinction in inclusive and exclusive.&lt;ref name="Valency" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

===Verbs===
Verbs mark person and number of core arguments. It has [[Active-stative language|split S]] morphology and active/[[Voice (grammar)#Middle|middle]] voice distinction. Verbs also mark one of fourteen [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] categories.&lt;ref name="Valency" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

====Structure====
The verb structure consists primarily of suffixes: 
:(i) verb stem 
:(ii) bound pronominal morphemes, cross-referencing the person and number of core argument(s)
:(iii) a TAM suffix
:(iv) non-medial verbs that are fully inflected cross-reference the gender of the topical argument.
:(iv′) other non-medial verbs and same-subject medial verbs mark nothing else
:(iv″) different-subject medial verbs have a form indicating both aspect and switch-reference.

There are some verbs that are exceptions to this structure, such as the Definite Future suffix which requires no gender marking, and some TAM morphemes in medial verbs.

====Valency====
Siwai has four types of valency structure:&lt;ref name="Valency" /&gt;{{rp|118–9}}
:(a) plain transitives take A and O
:(b) extended transitives take A, O, and E
:(c) plain intransitives take S
:(d) extended intransitives take S and E
Some verbs are ambitransitive and take either active or middle voice. The voice system of the language is thus a "verbal diathesis" where the configuration of core arguments determine the active or middle voice.

====Classes====
There are five main verb classes, which are determined by which cross-referencing morphemes they take:&lt;ref name="Valency"/&gt;{{rp|121–6}}
:(1) S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; verbs
:(2) S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; verbs
:(3) Irregular verbs ('be, exist', 'go', 'come', 'die', 'cry')
:(4) Ambitransitive (active-middle) verbs
::(a) 'reflexive action' (S=O=A)
::(b) 'spontaneous process/event' (S=O)
::(c) 'less agentive activity' (S=A)
:(5) Middle-only verbs
::(a) 'bodily action'
::(b) 'spontaneous process/event'
::(c) 'complex activity'

===Syntax===
Similar to many other Papuan languages, Siwai has medial verbs which are in the middle of a sentence and indicate [[Tense-aspect-mood|TAM]] and [[switch-reference]].&lt;ref name="Valency" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

{{styles}}

A '''style guide''' (or '''manual of style''') is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization, or field.  (It is often called a '''style sheet''', though that term has other meanings.)

A style guide establishes and enforces [[wikt:style#Noun|style]] to improve [[communication]]. To do that, it ensures [[wikt:consistency#Noun|consistency]] within a document and across multiple documents and enforces [[best practice]] in [[usage]] and in [[Composition (language)|language composition]], [[Composition (visual arts)|visual composition]], [[orthography]] and [[typography]]. For [[Academic publishing|academic]] and [[Technical communication|technical]] documents, a guide may also enforce the best practice in [[ethics]] (such as [[authorship]], [[research ethics]], and [[:wikt:disclosure|disclosure]]), [[pedagogy]] (such as [[expository writing|exposition]] and clarity), and compliance ([[Technical standard|technical]] and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]]).

Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[Academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and specific industries. '''House style''' refers to the internal style manual of a particular publisher or organization.

==Varieties==
Style guides vary widely in scope and size.

===Sizes===
This variety in scope and length is enabled by the cascading of one style over another, in a way analogous to how styles cascade [[style sheet (web development)|in web development]] and [[style sheet (desktop publishing)|in desktop publishing]] (e.g., how inline styles in [[HTML]] cascade over [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] styles).

A short style guide is often called a ''style sheet''. A comprehensive guide tends to be long and is often called a ''style manual'' or ''manual of style'' (''MOS'' or ''MoS'').  In many cases, a project such as one [[book]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[monograph]] series typically has a short style sheet that cascades over the somewhat larger style guide of an organization such as a [[publishing]] company, whose content is usually called ''house style''. Most house styles, in turn, cascade over an ''industry-wide or profession-wide style manual'' that is even more comprehensive. Some examples of these industry style guides include the following: 
* [[AP Stylebook|AP style]] for journalism and most forms of corporate communications
* [[United States Government Printing Office#GPO's Style Manual|USGPO style]] or [[Australian Government Publishing Service|AGPS style]] for government publications 
* [[Hart's Rules|Oxford style]] and [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago style]] for academic publishing and readership 
* [[APA style]] and [[ASA style]] for the social sciences 
* [[CSE style]] for various physical sciences 
* [[ACS style]] for chemistry 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]] for medicine 
* [[Bluebook]] style for law

Finally, these reference works cascade over the [[orthography|orthographic]] norms of the language in use (for example, [[English orthography]] for English-language publications). This, of course, may be subject to national variety such as [[comparison of American and British English|the different varieties of American English and British English]].

=== Topics ===
Some style guides focus on specific topic areas such as [[graphic design]], including [[typography]]. Website style guides cover a publication's visual and technical aspects along with text.

Style guides that cover [[usage]] may suggest ways of describing people that avoid [[racism]], [[sexism]], and [[homophobia]]. Guides in specific scientific and technical fields cover [[nomenclature]], which specifies names or classifying labels that are preferred because they are clear, standardized, and [[ontology|ontologically]] sound (e.g., [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[chemical nomenclature]], and [[gene nomenclature]]).

==Updating==
Most style guides are revised periodically to accommodate changes in conventions and [[usage]]. The frequency of updating and the [[revision control]] are determined by the subject matter. For style manuals in [[reference work]] format, new [[edition (book)|editions]] typically appear every 1 to 20 years. For example, the [[AP Stylebook]] is revised annually, and the Chicago, APA, and ASA manuals are in their 17th, 6th, and 4th editions, respectively. Many house styles and individual project styles change more frequently, especially for new projects.

==Examples==
{{further|List of style guides}}

===International===
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. One example is [[ISO 215]] ''Documentation &amp;mdash; Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=4086 |title=ISO 215:1986 - Documentation - Presentation of contributions to periodicals and other serials |publisher=Iso.org |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
The [[European Union]] publishes an ''Interinstitutional style guide''—encompassing [[Languages of the European Union#Official EU languages|24 languages]] across the European Union. This manual is "obligatory" for all those employed by the institutions of the EU who are involved in preparing EU documents and works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-360400.htm|title= Interinstitutional Style Guide|author= Publications Office of the European Union|date= 24 July 2008|work= Europa|publisher= European Union12 May 2010|ref= Eur08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]] of the [[European Commission]] publishes its own ''English Style Guide'', intended primarily for English-language authors and translators, but aiming to serve a wider readership as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/english-resources-english-style-guide_en|title= English Style Guide|author= Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|publisher= European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Press Stylebook is written to be used together with The Elements of Style to provide a very complete grammar and English style reference with no conflicts.

{{For|Systems Operator (aircraft crew member)|Flight engineer}}
A '''sysop''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|ɒ|p}}; an abbreviation of '''system operator''') is an administrator of a multi-user computer system, such as a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) or an [[Online service provider|online service]] [[virtual community]].&lt;ref name="netlingo"&gt;Jansen, E. &amp; James,V. (2002). NetLingo: the Internet dictionary. Netlingo Inc., Oxnard, CA&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase may also be used to refer to administrators of other [[Internet]]-based [[Computer network|network]] services.&lt;ref name="solaris"&gt;Rhodes, D. &amp; Butler, D. (2002). Solaris Operating Environment Boot Camp. Prentice Hall Professional.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Co-sysops''' are users who may be granted certain admin privileges on a BBS. Generally, they help validate users and monitor discussion [[Internet forum|forums]]. Some co-sysops serve as file clerks, reviewing, describing, and publishing newly [[upload]]ed files into appropriate [[download]] directories.&lt;ref name="hacking"&gt;Gupta, A. (2004). Hacking In The Computer World. Mittal Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term ''system operator'' applied to operators of any computer system, especially a [[mainframe computer]]. In general, a sysop is a person who oversees the operation of a server, typically in a large computer system. Usage of the term became popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, originally in reference to BBS operators.&lt;ref name="netlingo" /&gt; A person with equivalent functions on a [[Internet hosting service|network host]] or [[Internet server|server]] is typically called a ''sysadmin'', short for [[system administrator]].&lt;ref name="solaris" /&gt;

Because such duties were often shared with that of the sysadmin prior to the advent of the [[World Wide Web]], the term ''sysop'' is often used more generally to refer to an administrator or [[Forum moderator|moderator]], such as a [[Internet forum#Administrator|forum administrator]]. Hence, the term ''sysadmin'' is technically used to distinguish the professional position of a network operator.&lt;ref name="cyberspacelaw"&gt;Cavazos, E.A.

{{alphabet}}
'''The Thai alphabet''' ({{lang-th|อักษรไทย}}; {{RTGS|akson thai}}; {{IPA-th|ʔàksɔ̌ːn tʰāj|}} {{Audio|th-aksornthai.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is the [[abugida]] (''alphasyllabary'') used to write [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] and many [[:Category:Languages of Thailand|other languages]] spoken in [[Thailand]]. It has 44 consonant symbols ({{lang-th|พยัญชนะ}}, ''phayanchana''), 15 vowel symbols ({{lang-th|สระ}}, ''sara'') that combine with 28 vowel symbols and four tone diacritics ({{lang-th|วรรณยุกต์ or วรรณยุต}}, ''wannayuk'' or ''wannayut'') to create characters mostly representing syllables.

Although commonly referred to as the "Thai alphabet", the script is in fact not a true [[alphabet]] but an [[abugida]], a writing system in which each consonant may invoke an inherent vowel sound. In the case of the Thai script this is an implied 'a' or 'o'. Consonants are written horizontally from left to right, with vowels arranged above, below, to the left, or to the right of the corresponding consonant, or in a combination of positions.

Thai has its own set of [[Thai numerals]] that are based on the Hindu-Arabic numeral system ({{lang-th|เลขไทย}}, ''lek thai''), but the standard western [[Hindu-Arabic numerals]] ({{lang-th|เลขฮินดูอารบิก}}, ''lek hindu arabik'') are mainly used except for government documents and the license plates of military vehicles.

==History==

The Thai alphabet is derived from the Old [[Khmer script]] ({{lang-th|อักษรขอม}}, ''akson khom''), which is a southern [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]]c style of writing derived from the south Indian [[Pallava alphabet]] ({{lang-th|ปัลลวะ}}).

Thai is considered to be the first script in the world which invented [[Tone (linguistics)#Phonetic notation|tone markers]] to indicate distinctive tones,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony V. N. Diller, Thai Orthography and the History of Marking Tone, Oriens Extremus, Vol. 39, No. 2 (1996), pp. 228 - 248, 
{{cite journal
|jstor=24047473
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are lacking in the Mon-Khmer ([[Austroasiatic languages]]) and [[Indo-Aryan languages]] from which its script is derived. Although Chinese and other [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have distinctive tones in their phonological system, no tone marker is found in their orthographies. Thus, tone markers are an innovation in the Thai language that later influenced other related Tai languages and some [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] on the Southeast Asian mainland.

In most Brahmic scripts such as Devanagari, Khmer or Mon script; successive consonants lacking a vowel in between them may physically join together as a ''conjunct'' or [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]. However Thai (and the related Lao script) is unique in how it does not have a system of conjunct letters or subscript consonants.

Thai tradition attributes the creation of the script to [[King Ramkhamhaeng the Great]] ({{lang-th|พ่อขุนรามคำแหงมหาราช}}) in 1283, though this has been challenged.[[File:Bangkok National Museum - 2017-04-22 (008).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ramkhamhaeng inscription, the oldest inscription using proto-Thai script ([[Bangkok National Museum]])]]

==Orthography==

There is a fairly complex relationship between spelling and sound.  There are various issues:
#For many consonant sounds, there are two different letters that both represent the same sound, but which cause a different tone to be associated. This stems from a major change (a [[tone split]]) that occurred historically in the phonology of the Thai language.  At the time the Thai script was created, the language had three tones and a full set of contrasts between [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] and unvoiced consonants at the beginning of a syllable (e.g. ''b d g l m n'' vs. ''p t k hl hm hn'').  At a later time, the voicing distinction disappeared, but in the process, each of the three original tones split in two, with an originally voiced consonant (the modern "low" consonant signs) producing a lower-variant tone, and an originally unvoiced consonant (the modern "mid" and "high" consonant signs) producing a higher-variant tone.
#Thai borrowed a large number of words from [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], and the Thai alphabet was created so that the original spelling of these words could be preserved as much as possible.  This means that the Thai alphabet has a number of "duplicate" letters that represent separate sounds in Sanskrit and Pali (e.g. the [[breathy voiced]] sounds ''bh, dh, ḍh, jh, gh'' and the [[retroflex]] sounds ''ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ'') but which never represented distinct sounds in the Thai language.  These are mostly or exclusively used in Sanskrit and Pali borrowings.
#The desire to preserve original Sanskrit and Pali spellings also produces a particularly large number of duplicate ways of spelling sounds at the end of a syllable (where Thai is strictly limited in the sounds that can occur but Sanskrit allowed all possibilities, especially once former final /a/ was deleted), as well as a number of silent letters. Moreover, many consonants from Sanskrit and Pali loanwords are generally silent. The spelling of the words resembles Sanskrit or Pali orthography:
#* Thai {{lang|th|สามารถ}} (spelled ''sǎamaarth'' but pronounced ''sa-mat'' {{IPA|[sǎːmâːt]}} with a silent r and a plain t that is represented using an aspirated consonant) "to be able" (Sanskrit समर्थ ''samartha'')
#* Thai {{lang|th|จันทร์}} (spelled ''chanthr'' but pronounced ''chan'' {{IPA|[tɕan]}} because the th and the r are silent) "moon" (Sanskrit चन्द्र ''chandra'')

Thai letters do not have [[lower case|small]] and [[majuscule|capital]] forms like the Roman alphabet. Spaces between words are not used, except in certain linguistically motivated cases.

=== Punctuation ===

Minor pauses in sentences ''may'' be marked by a comma ({{lang-th|จุลภาค}} or {{lang|th|ลูกน้ำ}}, ''chunlaphak'' or ''luk nam''), and major pauses by a period ({{lang-th|มหัพภาค}} or {{lang|th|จุด}}, ''mahap phak'' or ''chut''), but most often are marked by a blank space ({{lang-th|วรรค}}, ''wak''). A bird's eye ๏ ({{lang-th|ตาไก่}}, ''ta kai'', officially called {{lang|th|ฟองมัน}}, ''fong man'') formerly indicated paragraphs, but is now obsolete.

A ''kho mut'' ๛ ({{lang-th|โคมูตร}}) can be used to mark the end of a [[chapter (books)|chapter]] or [[document]].

Thai writing also uses quotation marks ({{lang-th|อัญประกาศ}}, ''anyaprakat'') and parentheses (round brackets) ({{lang-th|วงเล็บ}}, ''wong lep'' or {{lang-th|นขลิขิต}}, ''nakha likhit''), but not square brackets or braces.

==Alphabet listing==

===Consonants===
&lt;!-- {{IPA notice}} --&gt;
There are 44 consonant letters representing 21 distinct consonant sounds. Duplicate consonants either correspond to sounds that existed in [[Thai language#Old Thai|Old Thai]] at the time the alphabet was created but no longer exist (in particular, [[voicing (phonetics)|voiced]] [[obstruent]]s such as ''b d g v z''), or different [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] consonants pronounced identically in Thai. There are in addition four consonant-vowel combination characters not included in the tally of 44.

Consonants are divided into three classes — in alphabetic order these are middle ({{lang|th|กลาง}}, ''klang''), high ({{lang|th|สูง}}, ''sung''), and low ({{lang|th|ต่ำ}}, ''tam'') class — as shown in the table below. These class designations reflect phonetic qualities of the sounds to which the letters originally corresponded in Old Thai. In particular, "middle" sounds were [[Voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] unaspirated [[Stop consonant|stops]]; "high" sounds, voiceless [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] stops or voiceless [[fricatives]]; "low" sounds, voiced. Subsequent sound changes have obscured the phonetic nature of these classes.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Modern Thai sounds /b/ and /d/ were formerly — and sometimes still are — pronounced /ʔb/ and /ʔd/. For this reason, they were treated as voiceless unaspirated, and hence placed in the "middle" class; this was also the reason they were unaffected by the changes that devoiced most originally voiced stops.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the class of a consonant without a tone mark, along with the short or long length of the accompanying vowel, determine the base accent ({{lang|th|พื้นเสียง}}, ''pheun siang''). Middle class consonants with a long vowel spell an additional four tones with one of four tone marks over the controlling consonant:  ''mai ek, mai tho, mai tri'', and ''mai chattawa''. High and low class consonants are limited to ''mai ek'' and ''mai tho'', as shown in the {{xref|[[#Tone|Tone table]]}}. Differing interpretations of the two marks or their absence allow low class consonants to spell tones not allowed for the corresponding high class consonant. In the case of digraphs where a low class follows a higher class consonant, the higher class rules apply, but the marker, if used, goes over the low class one; accordingly, {{lang|th|ห นำ}} ''ho nam'' and {{lang|th|อ นำ}} ''o nam'' may be considered to be digraphs as such, as explained below the Tone table.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Only low class consonants may have a base accent determined by the syllable being both ''long'' and ''dead''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Notes 
{{reflist|group=nb}}

To aid learning, each consonant is traditionally associated with an [[acrophony|acrophonic]] Thai word that either starts with the same sound, or features it prominently. For example, the name of the letter ข is ''kho khai'' (ข ไข่), in which ''kho'' is the sound it represents, and ''khai'' (ไข่) is a word which starts with the same sound and means "egg".

Two of the consonants, ฃ (''kho khuat'') and ฅ (''kho khon''), are no longer used in written Thai, but still appear on many keyboards and in character sets. When the first Thai typewriter was developed by Edwin Hunter McFarland in 1892, there was simply no space for all characters, thus two had to be left out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.t-h-a-i-l-a-n-d.org/smithpremier/smithpremierorigin.html

|accessdate=December 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, neither of these two letters correspond to a Sanskrit or Pali letter, and each of them, being a modified form of the letter that precedes it (compare ข and ค), has the same pronunciation and the same consonant class as the preceding letter (somewhat like the European [[long s]]). This makes them redundant. Set in 1890s Siam, a 2006 film titled in Thai: ฅนไฟบิน ''Flying Fire Person'' (in English: [[Dynamite Warrior]]), uses ฅ ''kho khon'' to spell ฅน ''Person''. Compare entry for ฅ in table below, where ''person'' is spelled คน.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Equivalents for romanisation are shown in the table below. Many consonants are pronounced differently at the beginning and at the end of a syllable. The entries in columns ''initial'' and ''final'' indicate the pronunciation for that consonant in the corresponding positions in a syllable. Where the entry is '-', the consonant may not be used to close a syllable. Where a combination of consonants ends a written syllable, only the first is pronounced; possible closing consonant sounds are limited to 'k', 'm', 'n', 'ng', 'p' and 't'.

Although official standards for romanisation are the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription]] (RTGS) defined by the Royal Thai Institute, and the almost identical {{nobreak|[[ISO 11940-2]]}} defined by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], many publications use different romanisation systems. In daily practice, a bewildering variety of romanisations are used, making it difficult to know how to pronounce a word, or to judge if two words (e.g. on a map and a street sign) are actually the same. For more precise information, an equivalent from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) is given as well.

# {{note|alphabetic-1}} The lower curves of the letter ญ are removed when certain letters are written below them, such as ญ + the mark ''[[#Nikkhahit นิคหิต (anusvāra)|nikkhahit]]'' (lower dot) = ญฺ, etc.
# {{note|alphabetic-2}} The lower curves of the letter ฐ are removed when certain letters are written below them, such as ฐ + the vowel mark ุ = ฐุ, etc.
# {{note|alphabetic-3}} When ย ends a [[closed syllable|syllable]], it is usually part of the [[#Vowels|vowel]]. For example, ''mai'' (หมา'''ย''', [maːj˩˥]), ''muai'' (หมว'''ย''', [muaj˩˥]), ''roi'' (โร'''ย''', [roːj˧]), and ''thui'' (ทุ'''ย''', [tʰuj˧]). There are some cases in which ย ends a syllable and is not part of the vowel (but serves as an independent ending consonant). An example is ''phi'''n'''yo'' (ภิ'''ย'''โย, [pʰĩn˧.joː˧]).
# {{note|alphabetic-4}} When ว ends a [[closed syllable|syllable]], it is always part of the [[#Vowels|vowel]]. For example, ''hio'' (หิ'''ว''', [hiw˩˥]), ''kao'' (กา'''ว''', [kaːw˧]), ''klua'' (กลั'''ว''', [kluːa˧]), and ''reo'' (เร็'''ว''', [rew˧]).
# {{note|alphabetic-5}} อ is a special case in that at the beginning of a word it is used as a [[zero consonant|silent initial]] for syllables that start with a vowel (all vowels are written relative to a consonant&amp;nbsp;— see below). The same symbol is used as a vowel in non-initial position.

====Phonetic====
The consonants can be organised by place and manner of articulation according to principles of the [[International Phonetic Association]].
Thai distinguishes among three voice/aspiration patterns for plosive consonants:
*unvoiced, unaspirated
*unvoiced, aspirated
*voiced, unaspirated

Where English has only a distinction between the voiced, unaspirated {{IPA|/b/}} and the unvoiced, aspirated {{IPA|/pʰ/}}, Thai distinguishes a third sound which is neither voiced nor aspirated, which occurs in English only as an allophone of {{IPA|/p/}}, approximately the sound of the ''p'' in "spin". There is similarly an alveolar {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/tʰ/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} triplet. In the velar series there is a {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/kʰ/}} pair and in the postalveolar series the {{IPA|/tɕ/}}, {{IPA|/tɕʰ/}} pair.

In each cell below, the first line indicates [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA),&lt;ref name="Tingsabadh 1993" /&gt; the second indicates the Thai characters in initial position (several letters appearing in the same box have identical pronunciation). Note how the conventional alphabetic order shown in the table above follows roughly the table below, reading the coloured blocks from right to left and top to bottom.

Although the overall 44 Thai consonants provide 21 sounds in case of initials, the case for finals is different. Note how the consonant sounds in the table for initials collapse in the table for final sounds. At the end of a syllable, all plosives are unvoiced, unaspirated, and have no audible release. Initial affricates and fricatives become final plosives. The initial trill (ร), approximant (ญ), and lateral approximants (ล,ฬ) are realized as a final nasal {{IPA|/n/}}.

Only 8 ending sounds, as well as no ending sound, are available in Thai pronunciation. Among these consonants, excluding the disused ฃ and ฅ, six (ฉ ผ ฝ ห อ ฮ) cannot be used as a final. The remaining 36 are grouped as following.

===Vowels===
Thai vowel sounds and diphthongs are written using a mixture of vowel symbols on a consonant base. Each vowel is shown in its correct position relative to a base consonant and sometimes a final consonant as well. Note that vowels can go above, below, left of or right of the consonant, or combinations of these places. If a vowel has parts before and after the initial consonant, and the syllable starts with a consonant cluster, the split will go around the whole cluster.

Twenty-one vowel symbol elements are traditionally named, which may appear alone or in combination to form compound symbols.

The [[inherent vowel]]s are {{IPA|/a/}} in [[open syllable]]s (CV) and {{IPA|/o/}} in [[closed syllable]]s (CVC). For example, {{color|#007000|ถนน}} transcribes {{IPA|/}}{{color|#007000|{{IPA|tʰ}}}}{{IPA|à}}{{color|#007000|{{IPA|n}}}}{{IPA|ǒ}}{{color|#007000|{{IPA|n}}}}{{IPA|/}} "road". There are a few exceptions in Pali loanwords, where the inherent vowel of an open syllable is {{IPA|/o/}}. The [[circumfix]] vowels, such as {{color|#700000|เ–าะ}} {{IPA|/ɔʔ/}}, encompass a preceding consonant with an inherent vowel. For example, {{IPA|/}}{{color|#007000|{{IPA|pʰ}}}}{{color|#700000|{{IPA|ɔʔ}}}}{{IPA|/}} is written {{color|#700000|เ}}{{color|#007000|พ}}{{color|#700000|าะ}}, and {{IPA|/}}{{color|#007000|{{IPA|tɕʰ}}}}{{IPA|a}}{{color|#007000|{{IPA|pʰ}}}}{{color|#700000|{{IPA|ɔʔ}}}}{{IPA|/}} "only" is written {{color|#700000|เ}}{{color|#007000|ฉพ}}{{color|#700000|าะ}}.

The characters '''ฤ ฤๅ''' (plus '''ฦ ฦๅ''', which are obsolete) are usually considered as vowels, the first being a short vowel sound, and the latter, long. As alphabetical entries, ฤ ฤๅ follow '''ร''', and themselves can be read as a combination of consonant and vowel, equivalent to รึ (short), and รือ (long) (and the obsolete pair as ลึ, ลือ), respectively. Moreover, '''ฤ'''  can act as '''ริ'''  as an integral part in many words mostly borrowed from [[Sanskrit]] such as ก'''ฤ'''ษณะ  (''kritsana'', not ''kruetsana''), '''ฤ'''ทธิ์ (''rit'', not ''ruet''), and ก'''ฤ'''ษดา (''kritsada'', not ''kruetsada''), for example. It is also used to spell อังก'''ฤ'''ษ ''angkrit'' England/English.

The pronunciation below is indicated by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]&lt;ref name="Tingsabadh 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tingsabadh|first=Kalaya|author2=Arthur S. Abramson |title=Thai|journal=Journal of the International Phonetic Association|year=1993|volume=23|issue=1|pages=24̂–28|doi=10.1017/S0025100300004746}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Romanisation according to the [[Royal Thai General System of Transcription|Royal Thai Institute]] as well as several variant Romanisations often encountered. A very approximate equivalent is given for various regions of English speakers and surrounding areas. Dotted circles represent the positions of consonants or consonant clusters. The first one represents the initial consonant and the latter (if it exists) represents the final.

''Ro han'' (ร หัน) is not usually considered a vowel and is not included in the following table. It represents the ''sara a'' {{IPA|/a/}} vowel in certain Sanskrit loanwords and appears as ◌รร◌. When used without a final consonant (◌รร), {{IPA|/n/}} is implied as the final consonant, giving {{IPA|[an]}}.

===Tone===
Thai is a [[Thai language#Tones|tonal language]], and the script gives full information on the [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]]. Tones are realised in the vowels, but indicated in the script by a combination of the class of the initial consonant (high, mid or low), [[vowel length]] (long or short), closing consonant ([[plosive]] or [[sonorant]], i.e., ''dead'' or ''live'') and, if present, one of four tone marks, whose name derive from the name of the digits [[Thai numerals#Alternate numbers|1–4 borrowed from Pali or Sanskrit]]. The rules for denoting tones are shown in the following chart:

[[File:Thai tone rules.png|thumb|Tone type top to bottom: high, rising, mid, falling, low. Initial consonant class left to right: low (blue), middle (green), high (red). Syllable type: live (empty circle), dead (full circle), dead short (narrow ellipse), dead long (wide ellipse).]]

"None", that is, no tone marker, is used with the base accent (พื้นเสียง, ''pheun siang''). ''Mai tri'' and ''mai chattawa'' are only used with mid-class consonants.

Two consonant characters (not diacritics) are used to modify the tone:
*'''ห นำ ''ho nam'', leading ho'''. A silent, high-class ห "leads" low-class nasal stops (ง, ญ, น and ม) and non-plosives (ว, ย, ร and ล), which have no corresponding high-class phonetic match, into the tone properties of a high-class consonant. In polysyllabic words, an initial mid- or high-class consonant with an implicit vowel similarly "leads" these same low-class consonants into the higher class tone rules, with the tone marker borne by the low-class consonant.
*'''อ นำ ''o nam'', leading o'''. In four words only, a silent, mid-class อ "leads" low-class ย into mid-class tone rules: อย่า (''ya'', don't) อยาก (''yak'', desire) อย่าง (''yang'', kind, sort, type) อยู่ (''yu'', stay). Note all four have long-vowel, low-tone ''siang ek'', but อยาก, a dead syllable, needs no tone marker, but the three live syllables all take ''mai ek''.

Exceptions where words are spelled with one tone but pronounced with another often occur in informal conversation (notably the pronouns ฉัน ''chan'' and เขา ''khao'', which are both pronounced with a high tone rather than the rising tone indicated by the script). Generally, when such words are recited or read in public, they are pronounced as spelled.

===Diacritics===
Other diacritics are used to indicate short vowels and silent letters:
*''Mai taikhu'' means "stick that climbs and squats". It is a miniature Thai numeral 8 '''๘'''. ''Mai taikhu'' is often used with ''sara e'' (เ) and ''sara ae'' (แ) in closed syllables.
*''Thanthakhat'' means "killing as punishment".

''Pai-yan noi'' and ''angkhan diao'' share the same character. ''Sara a'' (&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;–ะ&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;) used in combination with other characters is called ''wisanchani''.

Some of the characters can mark the beginning or end of a sentence, chapter, or episode of a story or of a stanza in a poem. These have changed use over time and are becoming uncommon.

==Sanskrit and Pali==
{{brahmic}}
The Thai script (like all [[Indic scripts]]) uses a number of modifications to write Sanskrit and related languages (in particular, Pali). [[Pali]] is very closely related to Sanskrit and is the liturgical language of Thai Buddhism. In Thailand, Pali is written and studied using a slightly modified Thai script. The main difference is that each consonant is followed by an implied short a (อะ), not the 'o', or 'ə' of Thai: this short a is never omitted in pronunciation, and if the vowel is not to be pronounced, then a specific symbol must be used, the ''pinthu'' อฺ (a solid dot under the consonant). This means that ''sara a'' (อะ) is never used when writing Pali, because it is always implied. For example, ''namo'' is written นะโม in Thai, but in Pali it is written as นโม, because the อะ is redundant. The Sanskrit word 'mantra' is written มนตร์ in Thai (and therefore pronounced ''mon''), but is written มนฺตฺร in Sanskrit (and therefore pronounced ''mantra''). When writing Pali, only 33 consonants and 12 vowels are used.

This is an example of a Pali text written using the Thai Sanskrit orthography: อรหํ สมฺมาสมฺพุทฺโธ ภควา {{IAST|[arahaṃ sammāsambuddho bhagavā]}}. Written in modern Thai orthography, this becomes อะระหัง สัมมาสัมพุทโธ ภะคะวา ''arahang sammasamphuttho phakhawa''.

In Thailand, Sanskrit is read out using the Thai values for all the consonants (so ค is read as ''kha'' and not [ga]), which makes Thai spoken Sanskrit incomprehensible to sanskritists not trained in Thailand. The Sanskrit values are used in transliteration (without the [[diacritic]]s), but these values are never actually used when Sanskrit is read out loud in Thailand. The vowels used in Thai are identical to Sanskrit, with the exception of ฤ, ฤๅ, ฦ, and ฦๅ, which are read using their Thai values, not their Sanskrit values. Sanskrit and Pali are not tonal languages, but in Thailand, the Thai tones are used when reading these languages out loud.

In the tables in this section, the Thai value (transliterated according to the Royal Thai system) of each letter is listed first, followed by the [[IAST]] value of each letter in square brackets. Remember that in Thailand, the IAST values are never used in pronunciation, but only sometimes in transcriptions (with the diacritics omitted). This disjoint between transcription and spoken value explains the romanisation for Sanskrit names in Thailand that many foreigners find confusing. For example, สุวรรณภูมิ is romanised as [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Suvarnabhumi]], but pronounced ''su-wan-na-phum''. ศรีนครินทร์ is romanised as [[Srinagarindra]] but pronounced ''si-nakha-rin''.

===Plosives (วรรค ''{{IAST|vargaḥ}}'')===

Plosives (also called stops) are listed in their traditional Sanskrit order, which corresponds to Thai alphabetical order from '''ก''' to '''ม''' with three exceptions: in Thai, high-class '''ข''' is followed by two obsolete characters with no Sanskrit equivalent, high-class ฃ and low-class ฅ; low-class '''ช''' is followed by sibilant ซ (low-class equivalent of high-class sibilant ส that follows ศ and ษ.)   The table gives the Thai value first, and then the IAST value in square brackets.

None of the Sanskrit plosives are pronounced as the Thai voiced plosives, so these are not represented in the table. While letters are listed here according to their class in Sanskrit, Thai has lost the distinction between many of the consonants. So, while there is a clear distinction between ช and ฌ in Sanskrit, in Thai these two consonants are pronounced identically (including tone). Likewise, the Thai phonemes do not differentiate between the retroflex and dental classes, because Thai has no retroflex consonants. The equivalents of all the retroflex consonants are pronounced identically to their dental counterparts: thus ฏ is pronounced like ต, and ฐ is pronounced like ถ, and so forth.

The Sanskrit unaspirated unvoiced plosives are pronounced as unaspirated unvoiced, whereas Sanskrit aspirated voiced plosives are pronounced as aspirated unvoiced.

===Non-plosives (อวรรค ''{{IAST|avargaḥ}}'')===

''[[Semivowel]]s and [[liquid consonants|liquids]]'' (กิ่งสระ ''pha king sara'' branch vowels") come in Thai alphabetical order after '''ม''', the last of the plosives. The term อวรรค ''awak'' means "without a break"; that is, without a plosive.

Like Sanskrit, Thai has no voiced sibilant (so no 'z' or 'zh'). In modern Thai, the distinction between the three high-class consonants has been lost and all three are pronounced 'sà'; however, foreign words with an sh-sound may still be transcribed as if the Sanskrit values still hold (e.g., ''ang-grit'' อังกฤษ for ''English'' instead of อังกฤส).
:'''ศ ศาลา''' (so sala) leads words, as in its example word, ศาลา. The digraph ศรี (Indic ''[[sri]]'') is regularly pronounced สี (si), as in [[Sisaket Province]], Thai: ศรีสะเกษ.
:'''ษ ฤๅษี''' (so rue-si) may only lead syllables ''within'' a word, as in its example, ฤๅษี, or to end a syllable as in ศรีสะเกษ ''Sisaket'' and อังกฤษ ''Angkrit'' English.
:'''ส เสือ''' (so suea) spells native Thai words that require a high-class /s/, as well as [[naturalized]] Pali/Sanskrit words, such as สารท (สาท) in [[Thetsagan Sart|Thetsakan Sat]]: เทศกาลสารท (เทด-สะ-กาน-สาท), formerly ศารท (สาท).
:'''ซ โซ่''' (so so), which follows the similar-appearing ช in Thai alphabetical order, spells words requiring a low-class /s/, as does ทร + vowel.
:'''ทร''', as in the heading of this section, เสียด'''แทร'''ก  (pronounced เสียดแซก ''siat saek''), when accompanied by a vowel (implicit in '''ทรง''' (ซง ''song'' an element in forming words used with royalty); a semivowel in '''ทรวง''' (ซวง ''suang'' chest, heart); or explicit in '''ทราย''' (ซาย ''sai'' sand). Exceptions to ทร + vowel = /s/ are the prefix '''โทร-''' (equivalent to ''tele-'' far, pronounced โทระ ''to-ra''), and phonetic re-spellings of English tr- (as in the phonetic respelling of ''trumpet'': ทรัมเพ็ท.) '''ทร''' is otherwise pronounced as two syllables ทอระ-, as in ทรมาน (ทอระมาน ''to-ra-man'' to torment).

====Voiced h (มีหนักมีลม)====

| ห || hà [ha]

'''ห''', a high-class consonant, comes next in alphabetical order, but its low-class equivalent, '''ฮ''', follows similar-appearing อ as the last letter of the Thai alphabet. Like modern Hindi, the voicing has disappeared, and the letter is now pronounced like English 'h'. Like Sanskrit, this letter may only be used to start a syllable, but may not end it. (A popular beer is romanized as [[Singha]], but in Thai is สิงห์, with a ''karan'' on the ห; correct pronunciation is "[[singh|sing]]", but foreigners to Thailand typically say "sing-ha".)

All consonants have an inherent 'a' sound, and therefore there is no need to use the ะ symbol when writing Sanskrit. The Thai vowels อื, ไอ, ใอ, and so forth, are not used in Sanskrit. The [[zero consonant]], อ, is unique to the Indic alphabets descended from Khmer. When it occurs in Sanskrit, it is always the zero consonant and never the vowel ''o'' {{IPA|[ɔː]}}. Its use in Sanskrit is therefore to write vowels that cannot be otherwise written alone: e.g., อา or อี. When อ is written on its own, then it is a carrier for the implied vowel, ''a'' {{IPA|[a]}} (equivalent to อะ in Thai).

The vowels อำ and อึ occur in Sanskrit, but only as the combination of the pure vowels ''sara a'' อา or ''sara i'' อิ with ''nikkhahit'' อํ.

===Other symbols===
There are a number of additional symbols only used to write Sanskrit or Pali, and not used in writing Thai.
{{anchor|anusvara|nikkhahit}}

====Nikkhahit นิคหิต (anusvāra)====
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Symbol
! IAST
|-
| อํ || {{IAST|ṃ}}
|}
In Sanskrit, the [[anusvāra]] indicates a certain kind of nasal sound. In Thai this is written as an open circle above the consonant. Nasalisation does not occur in Thai, therefore, a nasal stop is always substituted: e.g. ตํ {{IAST|taṃ}}, is pronounced as ตัง ''tang'' by Thai [[Sanskritism|sanskritists]]. If nikkhahit occurs before a consonant, then Thai uses a nasal stop of the same class: e.g. สํสฺกฺฤตา {{IAST|[saṃskṛta]}} is read as สันสกฤตา ''san-sa-krit-ta'' (The ส following the nikkhahit is a dental-class consonant, therefore the dental-class nasal stop น is used). For this reason, it has been suggested that in Thai, nikkhahit should be listed as a consonant.&lt;ref name="NECTEC"/&gt; ''Nikkhahit'' นิคหิต occurs as part of the Thai vowels ''sara am'' อำ and ''sara ue'' อึ.

====Pinthu พินทุ (virāma)====
&lt;big&gt;อฺ&lt;/big&gt;

Because the Thai script is an [[abugida]], a symbol (equivalent to [[virama|virāma]] in [[devanagari]]) needs to be added to indicate that the implied vowel is not to be pronounced. This is the pinthu, which is a solid dot (also called 'Bindu' in Sanskrit) below the consonant.

====Yamakkan ยามักการ====
&lt;big&gt;อ๎&lt;/big&gt;

Yamakkan is an obsolete symbol used to mark the beginning of consonant clusters: e.g. พ๎ราห๎มณ ''phramana'' {{IAST|[brāhmaṇa]}}. Without the yamakkan, this word would be pronounced ''pharahamana'' {{IAST|[barāhamaṇa]}} instead. This is a feature unique to the Thai script (other Indic scripts use a combination of ligatures, conjuncts or virāma to convey the same information). The symbol is obsolete because ''pinthu'' may be used to achieve the same effect: พฺราหฺมณ.

====Visarga====

The means of recording [[visarga]] (final voiceless 'h') in Thai has been lost, although the character ◌ะ which is used to transcribe a short /a/ or to add a glottal stop after a vowel is the closest equivalent.

==Unicode==
{{Main|Thai (Unicode block)}}

Thai script was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October, 1991 with the release of version 1.0.

The Unicode block for Thai is U+0E00–U+0E7F.  
It is a verbatim copy of the older [[TIS-620]] character set which encodes the vowels เ, แ, โ, ใ and ไ before the consonants they follow, and thus Thai, [[Lao script|Lao]], and [[Tai Dam language|Tai Viet]] are the only [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]] scripts in Unicode that use visual order instead of logical order.

{{Infobox Bertrand Russell}}
The '''theory of descriptions''' is the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]'s most significant contribution to the [[philosophy of language]]. It is also known as''' Russell's theory of descriptions''' (commonly abbreviated as '''RTD'''). In short, Russell argued that the [[syntactic]] form of descriptions (phrases that took the form of "The aardvark" and "An aardvark") is misleading, as it does not correlate their logical and/or [[semantic]] architecture. While descriptions may seem fairly uncontroversial phrases, Russell argued that providing a satisfactory analysis of the linguistic and logical properties of a description is vital to clarity in important philosophical debates, particularly in semantic arguments, epistemology and metaphysics.

Since the first development of the theory in Russell's 1905 paper "[[On Denoting]]", RTD has been hugely influential and well-received within the philosophy of language. However, it has not been without its critics. In particular, the philosophers [[P. F. Strawson]] and [[Keith Donnellan]] have given notable, well known criticisms of the theory. Most recently, RTD has been defended by various philosophers and even developed in promising ways to bring it into harmony with [[generative grammar]] in [[Noam Chomsky]]'s sense, particularly by [[Stephen Neale]]. Such developments have themselves been criticised, and debate continues.

Russell viewed his theory of descriptions as a kind of analysis that is now called '''logical analysis'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/ Descriptions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''propositional analysis'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hochberg, ''Introducing Analytic Philosophy'', Walter de Gruyter, 2003, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia Langkau, Christian Nimtz (eds.), ''New Perspectives on Concepts'', Rodopi, 2010, p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with [[propositional calculus]]).

==Overview==
{{semantics}}
Bertrand Russell's theory of descriptions was initially put forth in his 1905 essay "On Denoting", published in the journal of philosophy ''Mind''.  Russell's theory is focused on the logical form of expressions involving denoting phrases, which he divides into three groups:

# Denoting phrases which do not denote anything, for example "the current Emperor of Kentucky".
# Phrases which denote one definite object, for example "the present President of the U.S.A."  We need not know which object the phrase refers to for it to be unambiguous, for example "the cutest kitten" is a unique individual but his or her actual identity is unknown.
# Phrases which denote ambiguously, for example, "an Aardvark".

''Indefinite descriptions'' constitute Russell's third group.  Descriptions most frequently appear in the standard subject–predicate form.  

Russell put forward his theory of descriptions to solve a number of problems in the philosophy of language.  The two major problems are (1) co-referring expressions and (2) non-referring expressions.

The problem of co-referring expressions originated primarily with [[Gottlob Frege]] as the problem of informative identities.  For example, if the morning star and the evening star are the same planet in the sky seen at different times of day (indeed, they are both the planet [[Venus]]: the morning star is the planet Venus seen in the morning sky and the evening star is the planet Venus seen in the evening sky), how is it that someone can think that the morning star rises in the morning but the evening star does not? This is apparently problematic because although the two expressions seem to denote the same thing, one cannot substitute one for the other, which one ought to be able to do with identical or synonymous expressions.

The problem of non-referring expressions is that certain expressions that are meaningful do not truly refer to anything.  For example, by "any dog is annoying" it is not meant that there is a particular individual dog, namely ''any dog'', that has the property of being annoying (similar considerations go for "some dog", "every dog", "a dog", and so on).  Likewise, by "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray" it is not meant that there is some individual, namely ''the current Emperor of Kentucky '', who has the property of being gray; Kentucky was never a monarchy, so there is currently no Emperor. Thus, what Russell wants to avoid is admitting mysterious non-existent entities into his [[ontology]].  Furthermore, the [[law of the excluded middle]] requires that one of the following propositions, for example, must be true: either "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray" or "it is not the case that the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray".  Normally, propositions of the subject-predicate form are said to be true if and only if the subject is in the [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] of the predicate.  But, there is currently no Emperor of Kentucky.  So, since the subject does not exist, it is not in the extension of either predicate (it is not on the list of gray people or non-gray people).  Thus, it appears that this is a case in which the law of excluded middle is violated, which is also an indication that something has gone wrong.

==Definite descriptions==
{{See also|Definite description}}
Russell analyses definite descriptions similarly to indefinite descriptions, except that the individual is now uniquely specified.  Take as an example of a definite description the sentence "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray".  Russell analyses this phrase into the following component parts (with 'x' and 'y' representing variables):

#there is an x such that x is an emperor of Kentucky.
#for every x and every y, if both x and y are emperors of Kentucky, then y is x (i.e. there is at most one emperor of Kentucky).
#anything that is an emperor of Kentucky is gray.

Thus, a definite description (of the general form 'the F is G') becomes the following existentially quantified phrase in classic symbolic logic (where 'x' and 'y' are variables and 'F' and 'G' are predicates – in the example above, F would be "is an emperor of Kentucky", and G would be "is gray"):

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x ((Fx \land \forall y(Fy \rightarrow  x=y)) \land Gx) &lt;/math&gt;

Informally, this reads as follows: something exists with the property F, there is only one such thing, and this unique thing also has the property G.

This analysis, according to Russell, solves the two problems noted above as related to definite descriptions:
# "The morning star rises in the morning" no longer needs to be thought of as having the subject-predicate form.  It is instead analysed as "there is one unique thing such that it is the morning star and it rises in the morning".  Thus, strictly speaking, the two expressions "the morning star..." and "the evening star..." are not synonymous, so it makes sense that they cannot be substituted (the analysed description of the evening star is "there is one unique thing such that it is the evening star and it rises in the evening"). This solves [[Gottlob Frege]]'s problem of informative identities.
# Since the phrase "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray" is not a referring expression, according to Russell's theory it need not refer to a mysterious non-existent entity.  Russell says that if there are no entities X with property F, the proposition "X has property G" is false for ''all'' values of X.

Russell says that all propositions in which the Emperor of Kentucky has a primary occurrence are false. The denials of such propositions are true, but in these cases the Emperor of Kentucky has a secondary occurrence (the [[truth value]] of the proposition is not a function of the truth of the existence of the Emperor of Kentucky).

==Indefinite descriptions==
Take as an example of an indefinite description the sentence "some dog is annoying".  Russell analyses this phrase into the following component parts (with 'x' and 'y' representing variables):

*There is an x such that:
#x is a dog; and
#x is being annoying.

Thus, an indefinite description (of the general form 'a D is A') becomes the following existentially quantified phrase in classic symbolic logic (where 'x' and 'y' are variables and 'D' and 'A' are predicates):

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x (Dx \land Ax)&lt;/math&gt;

Informally, this reads as follows: there is something such that it is D and A.

This analysis, according to Russell, solves the second problem noted above as related to indefinite descriptions.  Since the phrase "some dog is annoying" is not a referring expression, according to Russell's theory, it need not refer to a mysterious non-existent entity.  Furthermore, the law of excluded middle need not be violated (i.e. it remains a law), because "some dog is annoying" comes out true: there is a thing that is both a dog and annoying.  Thus, Russell's theory seems to be a better analysis insofar as it solves several problems.

==Criticism of Russell's analysis==

===P. F. Strawson===
[[P. F. Strawson]] argued that Russell had failed to correctly represent what one means when one says a sentence in the form of "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray." According to Strawson, this sentence is not contradicted by "No one is the current Emperor of Kentucky", for the former sentence contains not an existential assertion, but attempts to ''use'' "the current Emperor of Kentucky" as a referring (or denoting) phrase. Since there is no current Emperor of Kentucky, the phrase fails to refer to anything, and so the sentence is neither true nor false.

Another kind of counter-example that Strawson and philosophers since have raised concerns that of "incomplete" definite descriptions, that is sentences which have the form of a definite description but which do not uniquely denote an object. Strawson gives the example "the table is covered with books". Under Russell's theory, for such a sentence to be true there would have to be only one table in all of existence. But by uttering a phrase such as "the table is covered with books", the speaker is referring to a particular table: for instance, one that is in the vicinity of the speaker. Two broad responses have been constructed to this failure: a semantic and a pragmatic approach. The semantic approach of philosophers like [[Stephen Neale]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neale|first=Stephen|title=Descriptions|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262140454}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the sentence does in fact have the appropriate meaning as to make it true. Such meaning is added to the sentence by the particular context of the speaker—that, say, the context of standing next to a table "completes" the sentence. [[Ernie Lepore]] suggests that this approach treats "definite descriptions as harboring hidden indexical expressions, so that whatever descriptive meaning alone leaves unfinished its context of use can complete".&lt;ref name="Lepore"&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=Marga|editor1-last=Reimer|editor2-first=Anne|editor2-last=Bezuidenhout|title=Descriptions and Beyond|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019927052X|first1=Ernie|last1=Lepore|chapter=Abuse of Context in Semantics|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatist responses deny this intuition and say instead that the sentence itself, following Russell's analysis, is not true but that the act of uttering the false sentence communicated true information to the listener.

===Keith Donnellan===
According to [[Keith Donnellan]], there are two distinct ways we may use a definite description such as "the current Emperor of Kentucky is gray", and thus makes his distinction between the referential and the attributive use of a definite description. He argues that both Russell and Strawson make the mistake of attempting to analyse sentences removed from their context. We can mean different and distinct things while using the same sentence in different situations.

For example, suppose Smith has been brutally murdered. When the person who discovers Smith's body says, "Smith's murderer is insane", we may understand this as the attributive use of the definite description "Smith's murderer", and analyse the sentence according to Russell. This is because the discoverer might equivalently have worded the assertion, "Whoever killed Smith is insane." Now consider another speaker: suppose Jones, though innocent, has been arrested for the murder of Smith, and is now on trial. When a reporter sees Jones talking to himself outside the courtroom, and describes what she sees by saying, "Smith's murderer is insane", we may understand this as the referring use of the definite description, for we may equivalently reword the reporter's assertion thus: "That person who I see talking to himself, and who I believe murdered Smith, is insane." In this case, we should not accept Russell's analysis as correctly representing the reporter's assertion. On Russell's analysis, the sentence is to be understood as an existential quantification of the conjunction of three components:

*There is an x such that:
#x murdered Smith;
#there is no y, y not equal x, such that y murdered Smith; and
#x is insane.

If this analysis of the reporter's assertion were correct, then since Jones is innocent, we should take her to mean what the discoverer of Smith's body meant, that whoever murdered Smith is insane. We should then take her observation of Jones talking to himself to be irrelevant to the truth of her assertion. This clearly misses her point.

Thus the same sentence, "Smith's murderer is insane", can be used to mean quite different things in different contexts. There are, accordingly, contexts in which "the current Emperor of Kentucky is not gray"  is false because no one is the current Emperor of Kentucky, and contexts in which it is a sentence referring to a person whom the speaker takes to be the current Emperor of Kentucky, true or false according to the {{not a typo|hair}} of the pretender.

===Saul Kripke===
In ''Reference and Existence'',&lt;ref&gt;The book contains Kripke's previously unpublished [[John Locke Lectures]] at Oxford in 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argues that while Donnellan is correct to point out two uses of the phrase, it does not follow that the phrase is ambiguous between two meanings.  For example, when the reporter ''finds out'' that Jones, the person she has been calling ''Smith's murderer'' did not murder Smith, she will admit that her use of the name was incorrect.  Kripke defends Russell's analysis of definite descriptions, and argues that Donnellan does not adequately distinguish meaning from use, or, speaker's meaning from sentence meaning.

'''Yankev Shternberg''' (in English language texts occasionally referred to as '''Jacob Sternberg'''; {{lang-yi|יעקבֿ שטערנבערג}}; {{lang-ru|link=no|Яков Моисеевич Штернберг}}; 1890, [[Lipcani]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Russian Empire]] – 1973, Moscow, [[USSR]]) was a [[Yiddish theater]] director, teacher of theater, playwright, ''avant-garde'' poet and short-story writer, best known for his theater work in [[Romania]] between the two world wars.&lt;ref name=Bercovici&gt;Bercovici 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shternberg grew up in the northern Bessarabian shtetl of Lipkany ([[Yiddish]]: ''Lipkon'', now [[Lipcani]] in Moldova), which was famously termed "Bessarabian Olympus" by [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]] poet [[Chaim Nachman Bialik]] and which in the second half of the 19th century produced several major figures of the modern [[Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew]] belle-lettres, among them [[Yehuda Shteinberg]] and [[Eliezer Shteinbarg]]. As a child, Shternberg went to school in [[Kamenets-Podolsky]] with and closely befriended another important future Yiddish writer [[Moyshe Altman]] (although they have parted ways years later)&lt;ref&gt;{{yi icon}} [http://yiddish.forward.com/oldarchive/121605/cultlit.html דער גרויסער שרײַבער און דענקער משה אַלטמאַן] ("Der groyser shraiber un denker Moyshe Altman"—"The great writer and thinker Moyshe Altman"), by Yekhiel Shraibman (Moldova), פאָרװערטס (''Forverts'' – The Yiddish Forward), December 16, 2005, p11. Note: The article is preceded by a short obituary of its author.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shternberg debuted in 1908 with a fairy tale in the newspaper ''Unzer Lebn'' ([[Odessa]]); published poetry in Reizen's collections "Fraye Erd" (1910) and "Dos Naye Land" (1911), and in "Gut Morgn" ([[Odessa]]). Moved to [[Czernowitz]], then to [[Romania]] in 1914 and became associated with a short-lived [[Yiddish]]-language magazine ''Likht'' ("Light"), four issues of which were published in [[Iaşi]] between December 1914 and September 1915. ''Likht'' called for a "renaissance of the Jewish stages in Romania" and condemned the "poor foundation" of Yiddish theater as a commercial institution: "The Yiddish stage ought to be a place of education, of drawing Jews closer together through the Yiddish word… we will fight against this [commercial] state of things."&lt;ref name=Bercovici/&gt;

[[Israil Bercovici]] counts the "literary-musical" gatherings sponsored by that magazine as "the beginning of modern Yiddish theater in Romania", and sees Shternberg as preparing the way for the [[Vilna Troupe]], the Yiddish theater troupe that brought the ideas of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] to Romania. Nonetheless, Shternberg adopted as a slogan "Back to [[Abraham Goldfaden|Goldfaden]]". Calling Abraham Goldfaden "the [[Prince Charming]] who woke up the lethargic Romanian Jewish Culture" when he founded professional Yiddish theater in 1876 ([[Iaşi]]), Shternberg wrote, "The only milieu that attracts the great Jewish masses is a traditional-[[culture|cultural]] theater. Not even a literary theater… From that I created a social-political theater, a theater… [of current events]… which I think was, then, the first of its kind in Yiddish".&lt;ref name=Bercovici/&gt;

In the 1910s, Shternberg published poetry in literary magazines ''Hamer'' ([[Brăila]]), ''Frayhayt'', ''Arbeter Tsaytung'', ''Dos Naye Lebm'' (all in Czernowitz), as well as in ''Literarishe Bleter'' (Warsaw) and ''Tsayt'' (New York). In 1917, in response to [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] violence at that time in Romania and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, he staged passages from Bialik.&lt;ref name=Bercovici/&gt; In 1920, he became the editor of "Der Veker", official organ of the Jewish section of the Romanian Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://vcisch1.narod.ru/SHTERNBERG/Shternberg.htm Яков Штернберг] ("Yacob Shternberg") on vcisch1.narod.ru. Accessed November 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s, after spending a year in Berlin, he started his own troupe in [[Bucharest]] (theater-review), for which he wrote nine plays (so-called "revistes") including ''Tsimes'' (named after a traditional pureed vegetable dish), ''Bukaresht-Yerusholaim'' ("Bucharest-Jerusalem"), ''Mitskedrinem'' ("All of a sudden"), ''Grine bleter'' ("Green leaves"), ''Kukuriku'', ''Sholem-Aleykhem'' ("Hello"), ''Hershele Ostropoler'' ("Hershele of Ostropol"). In 1924–26, he was the director for the [[Vilna troupe|"Vilner trupe"]]. The [[Romania]]n daily newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]'' wrote on August 23, 1924, shortly after the troupe's arrival in Bucharest, that "Such a demonstration of artistry, even on a small stage such as Jigniţa and even in a language like Yiddish ought to be seen by all who are interested in superior realization of drama."&lt;ref name=Bercovici&gt;Bercovici 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 he created a hugely successful studio theater ''[[Bucharest Yiddish Studio Theater|BITS]]'' ("'''B'''ukareshter '''Y'''idishe '''T'''eater-'''S'''tudiye"), housed in [[Bucharest]]'s Jewish quarter [[Văcărești, Bucharest|Văcărești]], that played a prominent role in the development of modern trends in European theater. BITS staged works of [[Osip Dymov (writer)|Osip Dymov]] (''Yashke-muzikant'' – "Yashka the Musician"), [[Jacob Gordin]], [[I.L. Peretz]] (''Banakht afn altn mark'' – "A night at the old market"), [[Sholem Aleichem]] (''Oytser'' – "Treasure", and most famously ''Der farkishefter shnayder'' – "The enchanted tailor"), [[Leyb Malekh]] (''Der Geler Shotn'', 1935), [[Nikolai Gogol]] (''[[Zhenitba (play)|Zhenit'ba]]'' – "The Marriage"), – mostly musical comedies with elements of grotesque, but also [[Israel Joshua Singer|I.Y. Singer's]] ''Yoshe Kalb'' and his own play ''Teater in Flamen'' ("Theater in Flames") on the theme of the then-ongoing [[Spanish Civil War]]. [[Sidi Tal]] starred in many of these productions. The performances were popular with the Bucharest intelligentsia and Peretz's "Banakht Afn Altn Mark", for one, was played more than 150 times. During this time, Shternberg published his first collection of poetry, in Bucharest (1938). As antisemitic, pro-fascist tendencies gained power in Bucharest, the theater left for a prolonged tour of major European cities and eventually Shternberg moved to [[Czernowitz]], where he continued his theatrical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://eleven.co.il/article/14930 Штернберг Я‘аков] ("Shternberg Y'akov"), Электронная Еврейская Энциклопедия (Elektronnnaya Ebreskaya Enchiklopedia—Electronic Jewish Encyclopedia), Ассоциация по исследованию еврейских общин (Assochiachia po Issledovaniio Evreiskich Obshchin—Association for Common Jewish Research), Jerusalem, November 15, 2005. Accessed November 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Shternberg along with Moyshe Altman sneaked across the [[Dniester]] and became a Soviet citizen. A year later, when his native [[Bessarabia]] [[Romania during World War II#The war begins|was annexed]] by the [[Soviet Union]], he and most of his former troupe settled in [[Kishinev]], where Shternberg became artistic director of the Yiddish-language [[Moldova]]n State Jewish Theater and staged, among other works, M. Daniel's ''Zyamke Kopatsh'' and Sholom-Aleichem's ''Motl Peysi Dem Khazns'' ("Motl Peysi, the cantor's son") with Sidi Tal in the boys' roles. During the war, he and his theatre evacuated to [[Uzbekistan]], where he worked for the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] and was mobilized into a paramilitary construction unit. After the war, he returned to Kishinev and resumed his work at the Moldovan State Jewish Theater, where he staged his play ''Di Balade fun der Esesovke Brunhilde un ir hunt'' ("The ballad of the SS soldier Brunhilde and her dog") and published poetry in the almanac ''[[Heymland]]'' (1948). He was arrested at the height of the Stalin's campaign against "[[rootless cosmopolitans]]" (Jews) in the spring of 1949 and was sent to labour camps for 7 years. On his early return and rehabilitation 5 years later, Shternberg settled in Moscow and worked as a translator of Romanian literary works into Russian. He began to publish literary essays and poetry in the newly founded ''[[Sovetish Heymland]]'' in 1961 and briefly became a member of its editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://judaica.kiev.ua/Conference/Conf30.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021229231009/http://judaica.kiev.ua/Conference/Conf30.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2002 |title=Элиезер Штеинбарг, Яков Штеренберг и Моше Альтман&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; писатели, творцы духовного наследия на идиш в ХХ в [Eliezer Steinbarg, Yakov Shternberg and Moshe Altman&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Creators of the spiritual heritage in Yiddish in the 20th century] |type=conference paper abstract |date=2001 |last=Dorfman |first=Boris |authorlink=Boris Dorfman |publisher=Institute of Judaica. judaica.kiev.ua|language=Ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections of his poetry were published in Bucharest and Paris, and in Hebrew translation by Shlionsky and Penn in [[Israel]] on the occasion of his 75th birthday. Shternberg died of a heart attack in 1973 on the very day he received a permission to leave for Israel. His wife, the composer [[Otiliya Likhtenshteyn]], who set his poems and those of other Soviet Yiddish poets (first of all [[Leib Kvitko]]) to music, died the same year. A collection of Shternberg's literary essays on theatrical topics was published posthumously in Israel.

A committed socialist, Shternberg wrote that, in the wake of the [[October Revolution]], "we satirized bourgeois assimilation, struggled with the [Jewish] clergy, fought for progressive Jewish culture, for the [[emancipation of the Jews]], for the rights of citizenship… for progressive Jewish literature."&lt;ref name=Bercovici/&gt;

'''Yolmo''' (Hyolmo), or '''Helambu Sherpa''', is a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]] of the [[Hyolmo people|Hyolmo]] people of [[Nepal]]. Yolmo is spoken predominantly in the [[Helambu]] and [[Melamchi]] valleys in northern [[Nuwakot District]] and northwestern [[Sindhupalchowk District]]. Dialects are also spoken by smaller populations in [[Lamjung District]] and [[Ilam District]], and also in [[Ramechhap District|Ramecchap District]] (where it is known as [[Kagate language|Syuba]]). It has a very high level of similarity with [[Kyirong language|Kyirong Tibetan,]]&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and weaker but still observable similarities to [[Standard Tibetan]] and [[Sherpa language|Sherpa]].&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yolmo Sketch Grammar|last=Hari|first=Anne Marie|publisher=Ekta Books|year=2010|location=Kathmandu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language Name ==
Yolmo is both the name of the language ([[glottonym]]), and the ethnic group of [[Yolmo people|people who speak the language]] ([[ethnonym]]). Yolmo is also written ''Hyolmo, Yholmo'' or ''Yohlmo''. The 'h' in all of these spellings marks that the word has [[Yolmo language#Tone|low tone]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2013|title=Notes on the relationship between Yolmo and Kagate|url=http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/HimalayanLinguistics/articles/2013/HLJ1202A.html|journal=Himalayan Linguistics|volume=12(2)|pages=1–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the language is referred to as ''Yolmo Tam'', ''tam'' is the Yolmo word for 'language'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yolmo-Nepali-English Dictionary|last=Hari|first=Anne Marie|author2=Lama, C.|publisher=Central Dept. of Linguistics, Tribhnvan University|year=2004|location=Kathmandu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language is also referred to as Helambu Sherpa. This usage was common in the 1970s (see, for example, Clarke's work from the early 1980s).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This name appears to have been an attempt by Yolmo speakers to align themselves with the widely recognised and prosperous [[Sherpa people|Sherpas]] of the [[Solukhumbu District|Solu-Khumbu]] district. While there are many cultural affinities between the two groups, the [[Sherpa language]] is not mutually intelligible with Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707486953|title=Yohlmo grammar sketch|last=Hari|first=Anna Maria|date=2010|publisher=SIL International and Central Department of Linguistics, Tribhuvan University|others=SIL International.|year=|isbn=9789937101080|location=Kathmandu|pages=4|oclc=707486953}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a growing recognition of Nepal's ethnic minorities ([[Adivasi|Janajati]]), Yolmo people have moved away from associating themselves with the Sherpas in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52872722|title=Sensory biographies : lives and deaths among Nepal's Yolmo Buddhists|last=Desjarlais|first=Robert|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|isbn=9780520936744|location=Berkeley, CA.|pages=8|oclc=52872722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language Family ==
Yolmo is part of the family of languages called [[Kyirong–Kagate languages|Kyirong-Kagate]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;N. Tournadre (2005) "L'aire linguistique tibétaine et ses divers dialectes." ''Lalies'', 2005, n°25, p.&amp;nbsp;7–56 [http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2005-aire.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The languages of this family are located along the Himalayan hills and mountains mostly on the Nepal side of the border, although Kyirong is in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet Antonymous Region]]. Along with Yolmo, [[Kyirong language|Kyirong]] and [[Kagate language|Syuba]], other languages in the family include [[Tsum language|Tsum]], [[Nubri language|Nubri]] and [[Gyalsumdo language|Gyalsumdo]].

The language family is better considered be Kyirong-Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=|year=2013|title=Notes on the relationship between Yolmo and Kagate|url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/nepling/|journal=Himalayan Linguistics|volume=12(2)|pages=1–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yolmo has far more speakers (at least 10,000) than Kagate (Syuba) (1,500), Yolmo speakers are found in multiple districts, including Melamchi, Lamung and Ilam, while Kagate speakers are based in Ramechhap. Also, ''Kagate'' is an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]], and speakers now prefer the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] ''Syuba,'' which carries less pejorative stigma than the [[caste]]-associated term ''Kagate'' ('papermaker')''.''

This is part of a larger cluster of [[Tibetic languages]], which all have their roots in the language that was the basis for [[Classical Tibetan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trans-Himalayan Linguistics: Historical and Descriptive Linguistics of the Himalayan Area|surname=Tournadre|given=Nicolas|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2014|isbn=978-3-11-031074-0|editor1-surname=Owen-Smith|editor1-given=Thomas|pages=103–129|chapter=The Tibetic languages and their classification|editor2-surname=Hill|editor2-given=Nathan W.}} ([http://www.nicolas-tournadre.net/wp-content/uploads/multimedia/2014-The_Tibetic_languages.pdf preprint])&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Yolmo speakers traditionally reside in the [[Helambu]] and Melamchi Valley regions in the [[Nuwakot District|Nuwakot]] and [[Sindhupalchowk District|Sindhupalchowk]] districts of Nepal. Yolmo speakers migrated to the area, across the [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], from the [[Gyirong County|Kyriong]], in what is now Southwest Tibet, over 300 years ago.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Graham E.|date=1980|title=A Helambu History|url=|journal=Journal of the Nepal Research Centre|volume=4|pages=1–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This migration appears to have occurred slowly over multiple generations, rather than one large migration event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pokharel|first=Binod|date=2010|title=Adaptation and Identity of Yolmo|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxjQUMiQ-SYTemVVcHNrSWo1c1E/view|journal=Occasional Papers|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main villages where Yolmo speakers reside include Melamchi Ghyang, Tarke Ghyang, Nakote, Kangyul, [[Sermathang]], Norbugoun, Timbu, and Kutumsang.

Yolmo speakers are [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] of the [[Nyingma]] school. Yolmo Lamas are called upon to perform religious rituals for the [[Tamang people|Tamang]]-speaking communities that live in villages below the Yolmo-inhabited areas. This has created a strong socio-cultural link between the two groups that is reflected in traditional marriage practice where Tamang women marry into Yolmo villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tibetan Studies in honor of Hugh Richardson|last=Clarke|first=Graham E.|publisher=Phillip|year=1980|isbn=|editor-last=Richardson|editor-first=Hugh|location=Warminster|pages=79–86|chapter=Lama and Tamang in Yolmo|editor-last2=Aris &amp; Phillip|editor-first2=Michael|editor-last3=Aung San Suu Kyi|editor-first3=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a tradition of [[bon]] shaman practice in the Yolmo area. This practice appears to be evolving fit with the modern focus on Buddhism among Yolmo people. For example, blood sacrifices are no longer performed as commonly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/903903900|title=Il Lama e il Bombo : sciamanismo e buddhismo tra gli Hyolmo del Nepal|last=Torri|first=Davide|publisher=Sapienza Sciamanica|year=|isbn=9788868123536|location=Rome|pages=|oclc=903903900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally Yolmo people were yak herders and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Naomi H.|date=1989|title=From zomo to yak: Change in a Sherpa village|url=|journal=Human Ecology|volume=17(2)|pages=177–204|doi=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They currently practice a combination of mixed agriculture involving livestock herding, hotel management, restaurants, and trading. Although outward migrants would often return to village life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Naomi H.|date=1993|title=Circular migration and families: A Hyolmo Sherpa example|url=|journal=South Asia Bulletin|volume=13(1&amp;2)|pages=59–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; speakers of Yolmo are increasing settling in Kathmandu, or moving overseas, which has an effect on transmission of the language as speakers move towards dominant languages of formal education such as Nepal and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yolmo-Nepali-English Dictionary|last=Hari|first=Anna Maria|last2=Lama|first2=Chhegu|publisher=Central Dept. of Linguistics, Tribhnvan University|year=2004|isbn=|location=Kathmandu|pages=702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
There are a number of dialects of Yolmo, spread throughout Nepal, thanks to migration in recent centuries, including in Lamjung&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961180469|title=A sketch grammar of Lamjung Yolmo|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|publisher=Asia Pacific Linguistics|others=|year=2016|isbn=9781922185341|location=|publication-place=Canberra|pages=|oclc=961180469}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ilam.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thokar|first=Rajendra|date=2009|title=Linguistic fieldwork in Jhapa and Ilam districts|url=|journal=Paper presented at the Linguistics Society of Nepal Annual Conference, Kathmandu, Nepal.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also closely related languages that should be considered when discussing Yolmo, including [[Kagate language|Kagate (Syuba)]] and Langtang. Some of these varieties have been documented in more detail than others. Below is a list of established dialects, including what is known about each.

=== Melamchi Valley Yolmo ===
[[File:IMG_3726_Sermathang.jpg|thumb|Sermathang Village, Melamchi Valley, Nepal]]
The variety of Yolmo documented by Anna Marie Hari is mostly spoken in the Melamchi Valley area. Hari documented the variety of Yolmo mostly spoken around the villages of [[Sermathang]] and Chhimi. Hari also encountered speakers from other areas in the Melamchi and Helambu valleys, and suggested there are two dialects across this area. mostly distinguished by vocabulary. The two dialects are the 'western' dialect, mostly in [[Nuwakot District|Nuwakot]] district and the 'eastern' dialect, which Hari's work focuses on.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While discussing these dialects Hari also observes that the variety spoken around Tarkeghyang is different again, suggesting there may be more than two dialects spoken in the area.

Hari produced a Yolmo-Nepali-English dictionary of the language with Chhegu Lama,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and a sketch grammar.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Hari's also translated the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] into Yolmo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Good news, the New Testament in Helambu Sherpa|last=Hari|first=Anna Maria|publisher=Samdan Publishers|year=2000|isbn=|location=Kathmandu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Original cassette recordings of her work have been digitised and archived with [[Paradisec|PARADISEC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/AH1|title=Hyolmo songs, stories and grammar drills|last=Hari|first=Anna Maria|date=1980|website=Paradisec|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless otherwise stated, all discussion of the grammar of Yolmo on this page is drawn from the work on Melamchi Valley Yolmo.

[[File:LG1-PICS-9025.jpg|thumb|Nayagaun, Lamjung, Nepal]]

=== Langtang ===
Northwest of the Yolmo-speaking areas in the [[Langtang valley]] of the [[Rasuwa District]] are three villages that speak a language that is mutually intelligible with Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kvicalova|first=Radka|last2=Slade|first2=Rebekha|last3=Gawne|first3=Lauren|date=2017|title=BOLD documentation of the Langtang language (Rasuwa).|url=|journal=Nepalese Linguistics|volume=32|pages=33–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language also shares features with [[Kyirong language|Kyirong]] and is likely part of a [[dialect continuum]] between Yolmo and Kyirong.

=== Lamjung Yolmo ===
[[File:Gawne2016-YolmoGrammar.pdf|thumb|Gawne 2016]]
Lamjung Yolmo is spoken by around 700 people in five villages of the [[Lamjung District]] of Nepal.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Yolmo speakers have been residing in this area for over a century.&lt;ref name="Gawne" /&gt; Gawne has written a sketch grammar&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and a Lamjung Yolmo-Nepali-English dictionary.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lamjung Yolmo - Nepali - English Dictionary|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|publisher=Custom Book Centre, The University of Melbourne|year=2010|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a digital archive of Lamjung Yolmo recordings archived with [[Paradisec|PARADISEC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/LG1|title=Yolmo (also known as Helambu Sherpa, Nepal)|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2009-2016|website=Paradisec|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ilam Yolmo ===
A dialect of Yolmo is reportedly spoken in the [[Ilam District]] of far east Nepal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is very little documentation of this variety, but it is mutually intelligible with Syuba.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Recordings from the dialect are available as a subset of an online collection of Syuba materials archived with [[Paradisec|PARADISEC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/SUY1|title=Kagate (Nepal)|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Paradisec|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syuba (Kagate) ===
Although [[Kagate language|Syuba]] has a distinct name, and a separate [[ISO 639 code list|ISO 639-3 code]], linguistically it can be considered a dialect of Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2017|title=Syuba (Kagate)|url=http://www.elpublishing.org/itempage/147|journal=Language Documentation and Description|volume=13|pages=65–93|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syuba speakers say their families migrated to the area more than a century ago.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hari, who worked on both Yolmo&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; and Syuba&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kagate phonemic summary|last=Höhlig|first=Monika|last2=Hari|first2=Anna Maria|publisher=Summer Institute of Linguistics Institute of Nepal and Asian Studies|year=1976|isbn=|location=Kathmandu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that "to quite a large extent they are mutually intelligible dialects".&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; The lexical similarity between Syuba and Melamchi Valley Yolmo is at least 79%, with the similarity between Syuba and Lamjung Yolmo even higher (88%). There is a higher level of similarity between Yolmo and Syuba than there is between either of these languages and Kyirong.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An investigation of the relationship between the Kyirong, Yòlmo, and Standard Spoken Tibetan speech varieties (unpublished MA thesis)|last=Hedlin|first=Matthew|publisher=Payap University|year=2011|isbn=|location=Chiang Mai, Thailand|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This all suggests that the separated dialects may have more in common with each other than with the main dialect area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2010|title=Lamjung Yolmo: a dialect of Yolmo, also known as Helambu Sherpa|url=|journal=Nepalese Linguistics|volume=25|pages=34–41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Syuba2016.jpg|thumb|A photograph of the cover of the Syuba-Nepali-English Dictionary]]

== Language Vitality ==
The vitality of the language varies depending on the location. In the Melamchi Valley area the language is spoken mostly by older adults. The younger generations having largely shifted to Nepali, though the language is being maintained for religious practices.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; The shift towards Nepali for younger speakers has also been observed in Lamjung, as this is the language used in schools.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961180469|title=A sketch grammar of Lamjung Yolmo|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|publisher=Asia Pacific Linguistics|others=|year=2016|isbn=9781922185341|location=Canberra|pages=5–6|oclc=961180469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syuba variety in Ramechhap is currently still spoken across all generations, including children.&lt;ref name=":022"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sociolinguistic survey of Kagate: Language vitality and community desires.|last=Mitchell, Jessica R. &amp; Stephanie R. Eichentopf|first=|publisher=Central Department of Linguistics Tribhuvan University, Nepal and SIL International|year=2013|isbn=|location=Kathmandu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is insufficient data on the Ilam or Langtang variety to assess their vitality at this stage.

== Orthography ==
Yolmo does not have a written tradition although there are attempts to develop an orthography based on [[Devanagari]], the script used to write the national language [[Nepali language|Nepali]], as seen in the publication of two dictionaries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Syuba speakers also settled on a Devanagari orthography for their dictionary.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syuba-Nepali-English Dictionary|last=SIL International and HIS Nepal|first=|publisher=Himalayan Indigenous Society Nepal|year=2015|isbn=|location=Kathmandu|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All of these dictionaries also present the languages in [[Romanization|Roman]] orthographies.

=== Devanagari ===
The modifications to [[Devanagari]] are minor, and are intended to ensure that all sounds in the language can be represented. None of the orthographies use the '[[Devanagari#Principle|inherent schwa vowel]]', meaning that a consonant without an overt vowel is not treated as having an implied vowel. Consonants remain the same as in the existing Devanagari tradition, with the use of joined [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] to represent additional sounds in the language, such as the combination of क (k) and य (y) for the palatal stop क्य ([c] 'kh'), स (s) and य (y) for the palatal fricative स्य ([ʃ] 'sh'), र and ह for the voiceless liquid र्ह ([r̥] 'rh'), and ल and ह for the voiceless lateral ल्ह ([l̥] 'lh').

Vowel length is unmarked in the Syuba dictionary, in the two Yolmo dictionaries the standard Devanagari length distinctions are made, with the addition of a small diacritic below the 'a' vowel ( ा) to indicate a longer vowel. The Hari &amp; Lama&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and Gawne&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; dictionaries both use ह (h) after the vowel to mark low tone (e.g. टाह ''ʈà'' 'pheasant'), while in the Syuba orthography a colon represents the low tone (टाः ''ʈà'' 'pheasant'). High tone is left unmarked.

=== Roman ===
All three dictionaries also make use of variations on a Romanised orthography, although this does not appear to be used or preferred by Yolmo speakers, and is intended for the English-literate audience of the dictionaries. Consonants predominantly take their form from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], with some exception where there is a more common preference in English, such as digraphs for the palatal stops ([c] 'ky', [c&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;] 'khy', [ɟ] 'gy') and non-superscript for aspiration (e.g. ''phá'' 'pig'). This is represented in the [[Yolmo language#Consonants|consonant chart]] in the Phonology section.

The vowels in Yolmo follow the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], except for [ɔ] which uses 'o' for ease of typing. Long vowels are represented by double characters, e.g. [ɲíː] 'two' is represented as ''ɲíi'', except in the Syuba dictionary&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; where vowel length is not indicated in either the Devanagari or Roman scripts. For tone Hari&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; uses a 'h' after the vowel to represent low tone, (e.g. ''toh'' 'stone') with high tone unmarked (e.g. ''to'' 'rice'), Gawne&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; uses the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] convention of using accents over the vowel to mark high and low tone (e.g. ''tó'' 'rice' and ''tò'' 'stone'), while the Syuba dictionary uses a superscript &lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt; at the start of the syllable to mark low tone (e.g. ''&lt;sup&gt;L&lt;/sup&gt;to'' 'stone') with high tone unmarked.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

On this page the orthography mostly follows Hari's transcription,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; as outlined in the phonology. Unlike Hari, representation of tone follows the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], with accents to mark high and low tone (e.g. ''tó'' 'rice' and ''tò'' 'stone' respectively). This avoids Hari's use of 'h' to represent both low tone and the sound [h].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Grammatical overview ==
The sections below contain an overview of the key features of the grammar of Yolmo. Information is mostly drawn from Hari's grammar of the language,&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; supplemented by the Yolmo-Nepali-English dictionary she co-wrote with Chhegu Lama.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Differences between this variety and other documented dialects are indicated where relevant. Links to other related languages will also be made where relevant.

All example sentences are presented with an interlinear gloss. This breaks down the words on a [[morpheme]] level, giving information about the meaning of each morpheme using a standard set of [[List of glossing abbreviations|glossing abbreviations]]. All examples are cited back to the original publication they are drawn from. Some glossing has been regularised, or added where it was not included in the original.

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
There are 36 consonants in Yolmo, which are summarized in the table below. The form is given in IPA and then to the right in brackets is given the form used in this article, if different.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Not all consonants are equally frequent. In particular [h], [r̥] and [l̥] are not particularly frequent, nor are vowel-initial words.

=== Vowels ===
There are five places of articulation for vowels. There is a length distinction at each place of articulation. The form of each vowel is given in IPA and then to the right in brackets is given the form used in this article, if different.

:{| class="wikitable IPA"
!
!Front

!'''High'''
|i  iː (ii) 
|
|u  uː (uu)
|-
!'''Mid'''
|e  eː (ee)
|
|ɔ (o)  ɔː (oo)
|-
!'''Low'''
|
|a  aː (aa) 
|}
Below are some minimal pairs that demonstrate the vowel length distinction:
:{|
|-
|''tɕí''
|'one'
|-
|''tɕíi''
|'what'
|-
|''tó''
|‘rice (cooked)'
|-
|''tóo''
|'be hungry'
|}
Vowel-length distinctions are not common across Tibetic language, but they are also attested in Syuba&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; (although Syuba speakers do not consider them salient enough to encode in the orthography&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;) and in Kyirong for open syllables.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60613565|title=The Tibetan dialect of Lende (Kyirong) : a grammatical description with historical annotations|last=Huber|first=Brigitte|date=2005|publisher=VGH Wissenschaftsverlag|year=|isbn=3882800690|location=Bonn|pages=20–21|oclc=60613565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other Tibetic languages, including [[Kyirong language|Kyirong]], and [[Standard Tibetan]], Yolmo does not have a [[Front rounded vowel|front rounded]] [y]. This is true for all dialects of Yolmo documented to date, including Syuba. Langtang, however, does have this vowel.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Tone ===
Like other Tibetic languages, Yolmo has tone, which is located on the first vowel of a word. Hari presents a four tone contrast of Melamchi Valley Yolmo; high level, high falling, low level and low falling.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Acoustic evidence from Lamjung Yolmo and Kagate indicates that there is only acoustic evidence for a contrast between two tones; low and high.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Below are some examples of tone minimal pairs:
:{|
|-
|''pú'' 
| 'body hair' 
|-
|''pù''
|‘son’
|-
|''kómba''
|‘thirsty’
|-
|''kòmba''
|‘temple’
|}

Low tone words can be marked with [[breathy voice]], but this is not always the case. The practice of indicating low tone with a 'h' following the vowel in [[Yolmo language#Orthography|some orthographies]] is related to this breathy property of low-tone vowels. The high tone, which uses [[modal voice]], is left unmarked.

Tone is predictable in some environments. It is always high following [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[Stop consonant|stops]], aspirated [[Affricate consonant|affricates]] and [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] (which speakers treat as equivalent to aspirated). Examples of all of these include:

:{|
|-
|''pháa''
| 'pig' 
|-
|''thí''
|'ruler (for measuring)'
|-
|''ʈháa''
|'blood'
|-
|''khyá''
|'you, plural'
|-
|''khá''
|'mouth'
|-
|''tshá''
|'salt'
|-
|''tɕhá''
|'pair'
|-
|''rhílmu''
|'round'
|-
|''lhá''
|'god'
|}
Tone is always low following [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] stops, voiced fricatives and voiced affricates. Examples of all of these include:
:{|
|-
|''bù''
| 'insect' 
|-
|''dà''
|'arrow'
|-
|''ɖù''
|'grain'
|-
|''gyàa''
|'place'
|-
|''gùri''
|'cat'
|-
|''dzàdi''
|'nutmeg'
|-
|''dʑùbu''
|'huge/much'
|-
|''zà''
|'rainbow'
|-
|''ʑèe''
|'udder'
|}
The only prefixes in the language are the [[Yolmo language#Negation|negator]] prefixes ''mà-'' and ''mè-''. Both have low tone, however if the following root has high tone it will not change tone because of the preceding low suffix.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

=== Syllable structure ===
Yolmo has the [[syllable structure]] (C)(C)V(C).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This means that the minimum a syllable needs is a [[vowel]]. Syllables can also have up to two consonants before the vowel and one after the vowel. 
:{|
|-
|V
|''òo''
|'there'
|-
|VC
|''ùr''
|'fly'
|-
|CV
|''pù''
|'son'
|-
|CVC
|''pùp''
|'keep warm'
|-
|CCV
|''prù''
|'write'
|-
|CCVC
|''prùl''
|'snake'
|}
All consonants and vowels can occur word-initial, with a restricted set able to occur in the second syllable. The set of syllable initial consonant clusters includes /pr, br, kr, py, phy, sw, kw, the, rw/.

All vowels can occur syllable-final, and final consonants include voiceless unaspirated bilabial /b/ and velar stops /k/, voiced liquids /l,r/, the voiced labio-velar /w/ and all nasals except the palatal /m, n, ng/.

=== Morphophonemic processes ===
There is a regular process by which the suffixes undergo a change depending on the nature of the verb that they are attached to. Suffixes that begin with a [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Stop consonant|stop]], such as the [[Yolmo language#Non-past Tense|non-past ''-ke'']], the [[Yolmo language#Imperative|imperative ''-toŋ'']] or the [[Yolmo language#Hortative|hortative ''-ka'']]'','' all undergo regular morphophonological processes. If they occur after a syllable with a final sound that is voiced they will also be voiced, if they occur after an unvoiced final sound, or an /r/ the start of the suffix will be unvoiced. The examples below are with the [[Yolmo language#Non-past Tense|non-past ''-ke'']]'':'' 
:{|
|-
|''tá-ge''
| watch-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|-
|''tén-ge''
|show-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|-
|''zàp-ke''
|dress.up-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|-
|''mùr-ke''
|chew-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|}
The only forms that cannot be predicted by this process is if the suffix is after /i/ or /e/, both of which are [[Vowel|high front vowels]]. The voicing cannot be predicted in this context, and the suffix is sometimes voiced and sometimes unvoiced. Below are examples of verbs with both /i/ and /e/: 
:{|
|-
|''pí-ge''
| pull.out-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|-
|''ɕí-ge''
|die-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|-
|''ɕé-ke''
|tell-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|-
|''kyé-ke''
|give.birth-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|}

There is also a tendency for suffixes that begin with -k/ -g to omit the initial sound after a vowel. This is not as regular a process as the voicing alterations described above. Below are some examples of this process:

:{|
|-
|''ŋà=i''
|1{{Smallcaps|1=sg=gen}}
|'my'
|-
|''ɖò-en''
|go-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|'go'
|}

== Word order ==
Yolmo has the basic word order of [[Subject–object–verb|Subject-Object-Verb]]. This is common in the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman family]].

:{|
|-
| ''ŋà=ki'' || ''tó'' || ''sà-sin''
|-
| 1{{Smallcaps|1=sg=erg}}|| rice.cooked || eat-{{Smallcaps|pst}}
|-
| colspan= 3 | 'I ate rice' (Gawne 2016: 69)
|}

== Nouns/Nominals ==
The [[noun phrase]] in Yolmo includes either a [[noun]] or a [[pronoun]]. The noun phrase with a noun can also include a [[determiner]], [[adjective]] and [[Numeral classifier|number marker]], while the options are more limited with a pronoun or [[proper noun]]. Noun suffixes include [[case marker]]s, [[Plural|plural marker]] and numeral classifiers.

The order of the noun phrase is (Determiner) '''Noun'''=Plural(-Focus Marker)(=Case) (Numeral Classifier) (Number) (Adjective).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Determiners ===
The Yolmo [[Definiteness|definite]] [[determiner]] is ''dì'' the same as the third person inanimate pronoun 'it/this'. It occurs before the noun:
:{|
|-
|'''''dì'''''||''pèza''
|-
|'''{{Smallcaps|det}}'''|| child 
|-
| colspan="2" | 'The child' (Hari 2010: 31)
|}
The [[Definiteness|indefinite]] is marked using the numeral ''tɕíi'' 'one', which comes after the noun, like other numbers: 
:{|
|-
|''mì''||'''''tɕíi'''''
|-
| person ||'''one'''
|-
| colspan="2" | 'A person' (Hari 2010: 91)
|}

=== Pronouns ===
Yolmo pronouns are presented in the table below. There is an [[Clusivity|inclusive/exclusive]] distinction for first person plural pronouns, a [[Grammatical gender|gender]] distinction for third person singular and an [[animacy]] distinction for third person.

:{| class="wikitable"
!
!Singular
!Plural
|-
!'''First person'''
|''ŋà''
|''òraŋ/ùu'' (inclusive)
''ɲì'' (exclusive)
|-
!'''Second person'''
|''khyé''
|''khyá''
|-
!'''Third Person'''
|''khó'' (masc.)
''mò'' (fem.)

''dì'' (inanimate)
|''khúŋ''

''dìya'' (inanimate)
|-
!'''Reflexive'''
|''ràŋ''
|}

The first person plural ''òraŋ'' is more commonly found in the Western dialects of Melamchi and Helambu Valley Yolmo, as well as Lamjung Yolmo, while ''ùu'' is more common in the Eastern dialects. It is possible to create a dual form by adding ''ɲíi'' to the plural form (e.g. ''khyá ɲíi'' 'you two'), although this is optional.

The third person plural ''khúŋ'' can also be used as a polite form for a single third person.

Pronouns do not take determiners, number, or adjectives.

==== Interrogative pronouns ====
[[Interrogative word|Interrogative pronouns]] are used to form questions. Yolmo has the following attested interrogative pronouns:  
:{|
|-
|''sú''||'who'
|-
|''nàm''|| 'when' 
|-
|''kàla''
|'where'
|-
|''tɕípe, tɕíle, tɕí mée''
|'why'
|-
|''tɕí''
|'what'
|-
|''kàndi''
|'which one'
|-
|''súgi''
|'whose'
|-
|''súla''
|'whom'
|-
|''kànɖu, kànmu''
|'how'
|}
Hari gives both ''kà'' and ''kàla (kà'' with the dative suffix) as forms for 'where' in Melamchi Valley Yolmo, but only ''kàla'' is attested in Lamjung Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are also a number of forms for 'why', ''tɕípe'' and ''tɕíle'' are attested in both Melamchi Valley Yolmo and Lamjung Yolmo, but only ''tɕí mée'' in Melamchi Valley Yolmo. This is because it uses the verb ''mée'' 'say' as part of the construction, which is not in Lamjung Yolmo (see the section on [[Yolmo language#Reported speech|reported speech]], as well as the [[Yolmo language#100 Word Swadesh List|word list]]). The ''kànmu'' form of 'how' is attested in Lamjung Yolmo, while ''kànɖu'' is used in Melamchi Valley Yolmo, with an optional ''-mu'' suffix to make ''kànɖu-mu.'' Hari and Lama also note the form ''kànɖu-bar'' in the Western regions.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Note that the words ''súgi'' and ''súla'' are complex forms, ''súgi'' is ''sú'' 'who' with the genitive case suffix, and ''súla'' is ''sú'' with the dative case suffix.

For more on the structure of interrogative clauses, see the section on [[Yolmo language#Question formation|question formation]].

=== Proper Nouns ===
Proper nouns include people's names, place names and the names of deities. They do not take determiners, number, or adjectives.

=== Plural ===
The [[plural]] marker in Melamchi and Lamjung Yolmo is ''=ya''.The plural is treated as a [[clitic]] as it occurs after an [[adjective]] if there is one, rather than always attaching directly to the noun: 
:{|
|-
|''kháŋba''||''tɕímbu''||''tɕhímbu='''ya'''''
|-
| house || big || big='''{{Smallcaps|pl}}'''
|-
| colspan="3" | 'The big houses' (Hari 2010: 28)
|}
Plural marking is optional if an overt number is used with the noun, or if the number is clear from context: 
:{|
|-
|''pèmpiʑa''  ||'''''súm'''''  ||''dù'' 
|-
| women ||'''three'''||{{Smallcaps|cop.pe}}
|-
| colspan="3" | 'There are three women' (Gawne 2016: 55)
|}
The plural form in Syuba is =''kya'',&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; which is more similar to the Kyirong form,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; suggesting the Yolmo ''=ya'' is an innovation.

=== Focus marker ===
Yolmo has a nominal focus marker ''-ti''. The focus marker gives prominence to the noun it is attached to. In the example below, the older brother is singled out, contrasted with other relatives who perhaps did not obtain such wealth:

:{|
|-
|''áda-'''di'''''
|''ɲìma''
|''ɲèdzen''
|''tɕhúkpu''
|''kàl-di''
|''oŋ-sin''
|''dù''
|-
| older.brother'''{{Smallcaps|1=-foc}}'''|| day ||every
|rich
|went-{{Smallcaps|pfv}}
|come-{{Smallcaps|pst}}
|{{Smallcaps|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="7" | 'The older brother became richer every day.' (Hari &amp; Lama 2004: 271) 
|}
Hari also notes for Melamchi Valley Yolmo that there is a focus marker ''-ka'', which is used specifically to mark something as contrary to expectation. 
:{|
|-
|''kháŋba''
|''tɕhímbu''
|''tɕhímbu=ya-la-'''ga'''''
|''&lt;nowiki/&gt;tè-ku''
|''dù''
|-
| house||big
|big={{Smallcaps|pl-loc}}'''{{Smallcaps|-foc}}'''
|reside-{{Smallcaps|ipfv}}
|{{Smallcaps|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="5" | 'I realize that they are living in big houses.' (Hari 2010: 27) 
|}

Nouns can also take the emphatic suffixes ''-ni'' and ''-raŋ'', which are also used for other parts of speech (see section on [[Yolmo language#Lexical emphasis|lexical emphasis]]).

=== Case marking ===
Yolmo uses [[Postpositional case|post-positional]] suffixes to mark the [[Case marking|case]] of nouns. Similar to other [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] languages, Yolmo uses a single case form for multiple functions. Case marking is treated as a [[clitic]], as clitics come at the end of the whole noun phrase, rather than directly attaching to only the noun. Below the cases are listed with their functions.
:{| class="wikitable"
!Case marker
!Function
|-
|=ki
|[[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]]
|-
|=la
|[[Locative case|locative]], [[Allative case|allative]], [[Dative case|dative]]
|-
|=le(gi)
|[[Ablative case|ablative]]
|}
The case markers are phonologically bound, with the =''ki'' form becoming voiced in some environments, it is also reduced to =''i'' in some environments. See the section on [[Yolmo language#Morphophonemic processes|morphophonemic processes]] for more on this.

Where there is also a plural the case marker comes after the plural, as in the example below:
:{|
|-
|''tɕàmu=ya='''gi'''''
|''kòŋa''
|''tɕú''
|''thál''
|''kyée''
|''dù''
|-
| hen{{Smallcaps|1==pl}}'''{{Smallcaps|1==erg}}'''|| egg ||ten
|{{Smallcaps|num.clf}}
|lay
|{{Smallcaps|cop.pe}}
|-
| colspan="6" | 'The hens laid ten eggs' (Hari 2010: 23) 
|}

==== Ergative case ====
Yolmo has optional [[Ergative case|ergative]] case-marking. Ergative marking means that [[Grammatical subject|subjects]] of [[intransitive verb]]s are unmarked, the same as [[Object (grammar)|objects]] of [[transitive verb]]s. Subjects of transitive verbs are distinguistshed from both of these with the ''=ki'' marker (in contrast to [[Nominative–accusative language|nominative-accusitive]] languages like English, where the subjects of both intransitive and transitive verbs are marked in contrast with objects of transitive verbs).

Below is an intransitive sentence, with the subject ''ŋà'' taking no marking:
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''
|''ŋù-sin''
|-
|{{Smallcaps|1=1sg}}||cry-{{Smallcaps|pst}}
|-
| colspan="2" | 'I cried' 
|}
In contrast with this ergative-marked transitive, where the subject ''ŋà'' is marked with the ergative:
:{|
|-
|''ŋà='''gi'''''
|''ɕò''
|''úp-sin''
|-
|{{Smallcaps|1=1sg}}'''{{Smallcaps|1==erg}}'''|| yoghurt ||cover-{{Smallcaps|pst}}
|-
| colspan="3" | 'I covered the yoghurt' (Hari 2010: 39) 
|}

Speakers do not always use the ergative case, which is why it is considered 'optional':
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||''tó''||''sà-ke''
|-
| 1{{Smallcaps|sg}}|| rice.cooked || eat-{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}
|-
| colspan="3" | 'I eat rice' (Gawne 2016: 69)
|}

Ergative marking is more common for [[past tense]], and non-[[Habitual aspect|habitual]] actions. There also appears to be some effect of animacy, and the ergative appears to be used as a strategy in discourse to mark [[Agent (grammar)|agentivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961180469|title=A sketch grammar of Lamjung Yolmo|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|publisher=Asia Pacific Linguistics|others=|year=2016|isbn=9781922185341|location=Canberra|pages=66–68|oclc=961180469}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of optional ergativity is common across the Tibeto-Burman family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chelliah|first=Shobhana L.|author1link=Shobhana Chelliah|last2=Hyslop|first2=Gwendolyn|date=2011|title=Introduction to Special Issue on Optional Case Marking in Tibeto-Burman|url=|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|volume=34(2)|pages=1–7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dative case ====
[[Dative case]] is typically used to indicate, broadly, the noun to which something is given. The Yolmo dative has this function, but it also has a function in 'dative subject' constructions. The dative subject occurs with a small set of [[intransitive verb]]s, and denote personal, and usually internal, states.

:{|
|-
|''ŋà='''la'''''||''hé''||''kà-en''
|-
| 1{{Smallcaps|sg}}='''{{Smallcaps|dat}}'''|| potatoes || like{{Smallcaps|-non.pst}}
|-
| colspan="3" | 'I like potatoes.' (Hari 2010: 42)
|}
The use of dative subjects is common in languages of this area, and is also [[Dative construction|attested more broadly]].

=== Number ===
As can be seen in the examples above, [[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]] can be used in noun phrases. A list of numbers in Yolmo is given in the section on [[Yolmo language#Numbers|numbers]] below.

==== Numeral classifiers ====
Yolmo also has an optional [[Classifier (linguistics)|numeral classifier]] ''thál''. This is used to emphasise number. In the example in the [[Yolmo language#Case marking|section on case marking]] above, the speaker is emphasising that the hens laid a large number of eggs.

Lamjung Yolmo also has the classifier ''mènda'' which can only be used with humans.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Adjectives ===
[[Adjective]]s occur within the [[noun phrase]]. Adjectives usually come after the noun so 'small child' would be ''pìʑa tɕháme'' (lit. 'child small'). Adjectives can also occur before the noun, especially in casual speech.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Verbs ==
There are three main types of verbs in Yolmo, [[lexical verb]]s, [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[Copula (linguistics)|copula verbs]]. The lexical verbs inflect for [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Evidentiality|evidence]] and can take [[Negation (grammar)|negation]]. The [[infinitive]] form of verbs takes the suffix -''tɕe.'' The infinitive is used in a number of constructions, including the [[Yolmo language#Habitual|habitual]] and [[Yolmo language#Complementation|complementation]].

=== Copula verbs ===
The copula verbs and their functions are given in the table below. Copulas are not inflected for person, number or politeness level and many do not distinguish tense:&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawne"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gawne|first1=Lauren|title=Report on the relationship between Yolmo and Kagate|journal=Himalayan Linguistics|date=2013|volume= 12 |issue= 2|pages=1–27|url=http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/HimalayanLinguistics/articles/2013/PDF/HLJ1202A.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''yèken/yèba'' (past tense)
|''yèʈo''

|}

Equation copulas are used to link two noun phrases, while existential copulas are used for functions of existence, location, attribution and possession.&lt;ref name="Gawne"/&gt; Hari describes the forms that end in ''-pa'' (voiced in this environment so they become ''-ba)'' as more emphatic, unlike lexical verbs with a ''-pa'' suffix they do not indicate [[Yolmo language#Past Tense|past tense]], and are not used exclusively in [[Yolmo language#Question formation|question structures]].&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Some copula verbs can also be used as verbal auxiliaries, particularly in constructions [[Yolmo language#Aspect|marked for aspect]], where they contribute evidential, tense or epistemic information. The negative forms of each copula are given in the section on [[Yolmo language#Negation|negation]].

Below the different [[Evidentiality|evidential]] and [[Epistemic modality|epistemic]] functions of each copula type are discussed.

==== Egophoric ====
The egophoric, or personal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2017-01-24|editor-last=Gawne|editor-first=Lauren|editor2-last=Hill|editor2-first=Nathan W.|title=Egophoric evidentiality in Bodish languages|url=https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110473742|journal=Evidential Systems of Tibetan Languages|language=en|volume=|pages=61–94|doi=10.1515/9783110473742|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to indicate that the speaker has personal knowledge about the information. In the example below, the speaker would not be reading the name of the book, but already know the name as they show it to someone else:
:{|
|-
|''òo''
|''tɕhée=gi''
|''mìn''
|''gyàldzen''
|''tsému''
|''púŋgyen''

| colspan="8" | 'This book is called 'Gyaldzen Tsemu Punggyen.' (Hari 2010: 66)
|}
Unlike in Standard Tibetan,&lt;ref&gt;Tournadre N. (2008), "Arguments against the Concept of ‘Conjunct’/‘Disjunct’ in Tibetan" in Chomolangma, Demawend und Kasbek. Festschrift für Roland Bielmeier zu seinem 65. Geburtstag. B. Huber, M. Volkart, P. Widmer, P. Schwieger, (Eds), Vol 1. p. 281–308. http://tournadre.nicolas.free.fr/fichiers/2008-Conjunct.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the speaker does not need to be personally close to an individual to use the egophoric while talking about them.

Different varieties of Yolmo prefer different forms of the egophoric as the default; In Helambu they prefer ''yìn'', in Lamjung ''yìmba'' and Ilam ''yìŋge''. ''yèken'' is past tense forms of the existential (''yèke'' in Lamjung), with the form ''yèba'' also often used in past tense structures, as well as questions. The past form cannot be further decomposed, as the form ''-ken/-ke'' is the [[Yolmo language#Non-past Tense|non-past tense suffix]] for lexical verbs.

There are some structures where the egophoric is used as the default, such as [[Yolmo language#Conditional|conditionals]].

==== Dubitative ====
Unlike the other copulas, which mark evidential distinctions, the dubitative copulas are epistemic forms used for reduced certainty. They are related to the [[Yolmo language#Dubitative|''-ʈo'' dubitative suffixes]] for lexical verbs. In the example below, the speaker does not have any direct evidence that Rijan is in the house, but thinks that is where he might be:
:{|
|-
|''rídʑan''
|''khím=la'' 
|'''''yèʈo''''' 
|-
|Rijan
| house={{Smallcaps|dat}}||'''{{Smallcaps|cop.dub}}'''
|-
| colspan="3" | 'Rijan is probably in the house.' (Gawne 2016: 88)
|}

==== Perceptual ====
The perceptual, or sensory, evidential is used to mark information acquired through direct sensory evidence, either through sight, one of the other [[sense]]s, or internal state (such as feeling an ache).   
:{|
|-
|''dèla''
|''ʈháa''
|'''''dù'''''
|-
|here
| blood||'''{{Smallcaps|cop.pe}}'''
|-
| colspan="3" | 'I see there is some blood here.' (Hari 2010: 60)
|}

Hari calls the perceptual forms [[mirative]], as indicating knowledge through sense often occurs for information recently acquired. Only the ''dùba'' form, with the emphatic suffix ''-pa'', appears to indicate some amount of surprise or counter-expectation.

==== General fact ====
The general fact form is used for uncontroversial and universally known facts. This verb is used in functions of existence, location, attribution and possession, and is not used in equational structures.  
:{|
|-
|''ɲì''
|''yùl=gi''
|''hé''
|''ɕìmbu''
|'''''òŋgen'''''
|-
|2{{Smallcaps|pl.ex}}
| village={{Smallcaps|gen}}||potato
|tasty
|'''{{Smallcaps|cop.dub}}'''
|-
| colspan="5" | 'The potatoes of our village are tasty.' (Hari 2010: 52)
|}
The form is ''òŋgen'' in Melamchi Valley Yolmo and ''òŋge'' in Lamjung Yolmo, demonstrating a link with the [[Yolmo language#Non-past Tense|non-past tense suffix]]. The verb itself is from the lexical verb ''òŋ-'' 'come'. It cannot be used for facts about the past. This copula is not attested in [[Standard Tibetan]] or any other Tibetic language outside of Yolmo.

=== Lexical verb stems ===
The Melamchi Valley variety of Yolmo exhibit verb stem alterations in the context of some verb structures.

Verb stems with short front vowels have their vowels lengthened (e.g. /i/→/ii/), short back vowels are fronted and lengthened (e.g. /o/ and /a/→/ee/, /u/→/i/). These changes occur mostly with [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] structures and [[Imperative mood|imperatives]]. Below are some examples of this alternation using the verb ''má-'' 'say':
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||'''''má'''-ke''
|-
|1{{sc|sg}}
|'''say'''-{{sc|non.pst}}
|-
| colspan="2" |'I say' (Hari 2010: 35)
|}
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||'''''mée'''-di''
|''yè''
|-
|1{{sc|sg}}
|'''say'''-{{sc|pfv}}
|{{sc|aux.ego}}
|-
| colspan="3" |'I have said' (Hari 2010: 35)
|}
:{|
|-
|'''''mée'''-doŋ''
|-
|'''say'''-{{sc|imp}}
|-
|'say it!' (Hari 2010: 35)
|}
When these structures are negated, the negative prefix is lengthened rather than the verb stem, which maintains the vowel change (this does not occur in the imperative).
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||'''''màa-'''mé'' 
|''yè''
|-
|1{{sc|sg}}
|say-{{sc|pfv}}
|{{sc|aux.ego}}
|-
| colspan="3" |'I have not said' (Hari 2010: 35)
|}
These alterations do not occur in Lamjung Yolmo&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or Syuba.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Auxiliary verbs ===
There is a small set of auxiliary verbs in Yolmo. The auxiliary ''tè''- is the same as the lexical verb ''tè''- 'sit' and is used to add imperfective aspect:&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

:{|
|-
| ''mò'' || ''sà'' || '''''tè'''-ku'' || ''dù''
|-
| she || eat || '''{{Smallcaps|aux}}'''{{Smallcaps|-ipvf}} || {{sc|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan=4 | 'she is eating'
|}

A subset of the copulas can also be used as verbal auxiliaries; ''yìn, yè, yèken ''and'' dù''. These contribute evidential information and for ''yè/yèken'' also some tense information. As you can see in the example above the ''dù'' copula is being used as an auxiliary, so they can co-occur with the other auxiliaries.

=== Tense ===
Yolmo has a major tense distinction between past and non-past. These are marked with suffixes on the lexical verb, ''-sin ''is the past tense marker and -''ke'' or -''ken ''is the non-past marker.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

==== Past tense ====
The past tense form is ''-sin.''

:{|
|- 
|''ŋà=gi''
|''ɕò''
|''úp-'''sin'''.'' 
|- 
| 1{{Smallcaps|1=sg=erg}}|| yoghurt || cover'''{{Smallcaps|-pst}}''' 
|- | colspan="3" | 'I covered up the yoghurt.' (Hari 2010: 23) 
|}

The past tense form ''-sin'' can also occur with the [[Yolmo language#Perceptual|perceptual evidential]] ''dú'' in an auxiliary position. This is not possible with the non-past tense suffix, nor can any other copula be used as an auxiliary with the past tense suffix. Hari suggests this structure is inferential, in that the speaker did not have to witness the event,&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Gawne describes it as 'narrative past'.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

:{|
|-
|''tɕhú-kúla''
|''tshúr''
|''gyùr-'''sin'''''
|'''''dù'''''
|-
| water channel|| this.side || change'''{{Smallcaps|-pst}}'''
|'''{{Smallcaps|aux.pe}}'''
|-
| colspan="4" | 'I see, the water channel has changed course to this side.' (Hari 2010: 45)
|}
Melamchi Valley Yolmo also has a past tense form ''-kyo'' that Hari refers to as the 'main-point past/ telling past’,&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; this form is not found in Lamjung Yolmo.

There is also the form ''-pa'', which Hari says is always used in [[Yolmo language#Question formation|question structures]]. In Lamjung Yolmo there are some examples where it is used in declaratives rather than questions, with a past-tense meaning.

:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||''tɕhám'''-pa''''' 
|-
| 1{{Smallcaps|sg}}|| dance'''{{Smallcaps|-pst}}'''
|-
| colspan="2" | 'I danced.' (Gawne 2016: 107)
|}

==== Non-past tense ====
The non-past tense is used for both present and future constructions. Hari gives the forms ''-ke'' and -''ken ''for Melamchi Valley Yolmo, but only ''-ke'' is attested in Lamjung Yolmo. 
:{|
|-
|''ŋà='''la'''''||''hé''||''kà-'''en'''''
|-
| 1{{Smallcaps|sg}}='''{{Smallcaps|dat}}'''|| potatoes || like'''{{Smallcaps|-non.pst}}'''
|-
| colspan="3" | 'I like potatoes.' (Hari 2010: 42)
|}
Hari refers to this form as the 'intentional present' but it can also be used in future constructions:
:{|
|-
|''dì''||''kyée-di''
|''ɲì-ti''
|''pèza''
|''ɕi''
|''ɖò-'''en'''''
|-
|this
| be.born{{Smallcaps|-perf}}|| 2{{Smallcaps|pl-emph}}
|child
|four
|go-'''{{Smallcaps|non.pst}}'''
|-
| colspan="6" | 'After this one is born we will have four children.' (Hari 2010: 53)
|}

=== Aspect ===
There are a number of verb suffixes that are used to mark aspect, these broadly fall into categories of [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[Perfective aspect|perfective]], as well as [[Habitual aspect|habitual]]. When an aspect form is used, a [[Yolmo language#Copula verbs|copula verb]] is also used.

==== Imperfective ====
The imperfective is used for events that are ongoing or not complete. The ''-ku'' suffix is attested in both Melamchi Valley and Lamjung Yolmo. It can only be used with the ''dù'' [[Yolmo language#Copula verbs|copula verb]].

:{|
|-
|''tìriŋ''
|''kháwa là''
|''thóŋ-'''gu'''''
|''dù''
|-
|today
| snow mountains|| be.seen{{Smallcaps|-impf}}
|{{Smallcaps|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="4" | 'Today the snow mountains can be seen.' (Hari 2010: 43)
|}

The imperfective form -''teraŋ'' can be used with either the ''dù'' or ''yè'' [[Yolmo language#Copula verbs|copula verb]]. In Lumjung Yolmo some speakers pronounce it as ''-tiraŋ.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hari refers to the -''teraŋ'' construction as the 'perfect continuous aspect', because it can be used to refer to something that was ongoing until a particular point, as per this first example:

:{|
|-
|''tànda''
|''sámma-ni''
|''ɖìbu''
|''tér-'''teraŋ'''''
|''yè''
|-
|now
| until{{Smallcaps|-foc}}|| money
|give'''{{Smallcaps|-impf}}'''
|{{Smallcaps|aux.ego}}
|-
| colspan="5" | 'Up to now he has been giving money.' (Hari &amp; Lama 2004: 278)
|}

Gawne describes it as an imperfective, as it does not appear to have this perfect aspect function in Lamjung Yolmo, as per this example:

:{|
|-
|''mò'' 
|''kòlela'' 
|''tè-'''teraŋ'''''
|''dù''
|-
|3{{Smallcaps|sg.f}}
| slowly|| sit'''{{Smallcaps|-impf}}'''
|{{Smallcaps|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="4" | 'She is slowly sitting down.' (Gawne 2016: 109)
|}

The [[Yolmo language#Auxiliary verbs|auxiliary verb ''tè'']] can also be used to mark an imperfective construction. Neither ''-ku'' nor -''teraŋ'' are used if the negative prefix is on the main verb. The auxiliary verb can be used in negative constructions, and takes the negative prefix, rather than the main verb. In the example below, the -''teraŋ'' imperfective is used as the negative prefix is on the auxiliary:

:{|
|-
|''ŋà'' 
|''lèn-'''diraŋ'''''
|''mà-tè''
|''yè'' 
|-
|1{{Smallcaps|sg}}
| sing'''{{Smallcaps|-impf}}'''||{{Smallcaps|neg.pst-aux}}
|{{Smallcaps|aux.ego}}
|-
| colspan="4" | 'I was not singing.' (Gawne 2016: 111)
|}

==== Perfective ====
The [[perfective aspect]] suffix is used for events that can be described as whole, without reference to the duration like the imperfective. The perfective form in Yolmo is ''-ti.''

:{|
|-
|''mèŋgaŋ-la-ni''
|''thóola''
|''tɕhám''
|''tɕhímbu''
|''káp-'''ti'''''
|''yè''
|-
|cooking.shed{{Smallcaps|-loc-foc}}
| above|| board
|large
|cover'''{{Smallcaps|-pfv}}'''
|{{Smallcaps|aux.ego}}
|-
| colspan="6" | 'The cooking shed was covered with large boards.' (Hari &amp; Lama 2004: 270)
|}

Multiple verbs with perfective aspect can be used together to create a [[Yolmo language#Clause chaining|clause chaining]] structure. It is distinct from the [[Yolmo language#Focus marker|nominal focus suffix]] ''-ti.''

==== Habitual ====
[[Habitual aspect]] marks that an event is usual, customary or frequent. There is no specific habitual aspect suffix for Yolmo. Speakers will either use a verb with an infinitive, or with no suffix.
:{|
|-
|''ŋà'' 
|''ɲìma'' 
|''ʈàŋmaraŋ'' 
|''khúra'' 
|''sà'' 
|''yè''
|-
|1{{Smallcaps|sg}}
| day|| every
|bread
|eat
|{{Smallcaps|aux.ego}}
|-
| colspan="6" | 'I eat bread every day.' (Gawne 2016: 112)
|}

=== Mood ===
Mood is marked in Yolmo with a set of verb suffixes. The main mood suffixes are given in the table below
:{| class="wikitable"
!Particle
!Function
|-
| -''toŋ''
|[[Imperative mood|Imperative]]
|-
|''-ka ''or ''-tɕo/tɕu''
|[[Hortative]]
|-
|''-ɲi''
|[[Optative mood|Optative]]
|-
|''-ʈo''
|[[Dubitative mood|Dubitative]]
|}

==== Imperative ====

The polite imperative suffix is -''toŋ'' (voiced as ''-doŋ'' after voiced codas and some vowels). An overt subject is not used, and the same imperative form is used regardless of person or number:
:{|
|-
|''mée-'''doŋ'''!''
|-
|speak-'''{{sc|imp}}'''
|-
|'Speak!' (Hari 2010: 46)
|}
The less polite form of the imperative consists of an unmarked verb stem: 
:{|
|-
|''mée!''
|-
|speak.{{sc|imp}}
|-
|'Speak!' (Hari 2010: 46)
|}

There are also a small number of irregular imperatives that are formed without the imperative suffix, particularly ''sò'' 'eat!', from ''sà''- 'eat'.

If there is an honorific form of the verb it can be used, unmarked, as the most polite form of the imperative: 
:{|
|-
|''ɕè''
|-
|eat.{{sc|hon}}
|-
|'Please eat' (Hari 2010: 113)
|}
The negative form of the imperative (the [[prohibitive]]) uses the ''mà-'' form of the [[Yolmo language#Negation|negator prefix]] with the verb stem. The imperative suffix is not included.
:{|
|-
|'''''mà'''-má!''
|-
|'''{{sc|neg}}'''-speak
|-
|'Don't speak!' (Hari 2010: 46)
|}

==== Hortative ====

Gawne notes two verbal suffix forms for the hortative in Lamjung Yolmo, a ''-ka'' and a ''-tɕo.''

The ''-ka'' form is used with all persons except first person singular.
:{|
|-
|''òraŋ'' ||''sà'''-ka''''' 
|-
|1{{sc|pl.incl}}
|eat-'''{{sc|hort}}'''
|-
| colspan="2" |‘Let’s eat!’ (Gawne 2016: 114)
|}

The suffix remains in negated horatitves:
:{|
|-
|''ɲì''||'''''mà'''-tɕhám'''-ka'''''
|-
|1{{sc|pl.excl}}
|'''{{sc|neg}}'''-dance-'''{{sc|hort}}'''
|-
| colspan="2" |‘Let’s not dance!’ (Gawne 2016: 114)
|}
The ''-tɕo'' form is used with first person singular, as well as with other persons. It also remains in negative constructions. 
:{|
|-
|''ŋà'' ||''khím=ki'' 
|''lè'' 
|''pè'''-tɕo''''' 
|-
|1{{sc|pl.excl}}
|house={{sc|gen}}
|work
|do-'''{{sc|hort}}'''
|-
| colspan="4" |‘Let me do the house work!’ (Gawne 2016: 114)
|}
''-tɕo'' appears to be less strong, and tends to be used more frequently. Hari gives the form as ''-tɕo'' (she also calls it an optative, but it appears to be a hortative) 
:{|
|-
|''tìriŋ''||''khó''
|''dèla-raŋ''
|''tè-'''tɕo'''''
|-
|today
|3{{sc|sg.m}}
|here-{{sc|emph}}
|sit-'''{{sc|hort}}'''
|-
| colspan="4" |‘Let him stay here today.’ (Hari &amp; Lama 2004: 174)
|}

==== Optative ====

Hari does not list an [[Optative mood|optative]] suffix.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; Gawne gives the optative -''ɲi'' in Lamjung Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||''ɲàl'''-ɲi'''''  
|''tè-ku''
|''dù''  
|-
|1{{sc|sg}}
|sleep='''{{sc|opt}}'''
|{{sc|aux-ipfv}}
|{{sc|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="4" |‘I want to sleep.’ (Gawne 2016: 115)
|}
Hari &amp; Lama (2004: 146) list ''ɲi-'' as a verb that expresses a 'strong wish’, clearly linking to the Lamjung Yolmo optative form.

==== Dubitative ====

Hari describes the [[Dubitative mood|dubitative]] as 'probable future',&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; indicating the sense of decreased certainty that the dubitative mood marks. The forms ''-ʈo, -ɖo'' and ''-ro'' are found in Melamchi Valley Yolmo as part of the [[Yolmo language#Morphophonemic processes|morphophonemic voicing process]], but the ''-ro'' form is not found in Lamjung Yolmo.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
:{|
|-
|''khúŋ-gi''||''sèn''
|''sà-'''ro'''''
|-
|{{sc|3pl-erg}}
|corn.mash
|eat-{{sc|dub}}
|-
| colspan="3" |'they will probably eat corn mash’ (Hari &amp; Lama 2004: 237)
|}
This verb suffix is related to the dubitative form of the copula.

=== Negation ===
Negation is marked on lexical verbs by [[prefix]]. There are two prefix forms, ''mè-'' is for negation in [[Nonpast tense|non-past tense]] (present and future), while ''mà''- is used for past tense, as well as negation of imperatives (''mà-tàp!'' 'don't fall'!). 
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||'''''mè'''-tàp''
|-
|1{{sc|sg}}
|'''{{sc|neg.non.pst}}'''-fill
|-
| colspan="2" |'I do not/will not fall.' (Hari 2010: 132)
|}
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''||'''''mà'''-tàp''
|-
|1{{sc|sg}}
|'''{{sc|neg.pst}}'''-fill
|-
| colspan="2" |'I did not fall.' (Hari 2010: 132)
|}
The negated forms of copulas are slightly irregular. They are listed in the table below in brackets underneath the regular forms:

== Clause structure ==
This section outlines some of the main features of the structure of [[Sentence clause structure|clauses]] in Yolmo.

=== Nominalisation ===
[[Nominalization|Nominalisation]] is the process by which words undergo a change that allows them to act as nouns. While nominalisation is common process, it is particularly pervasive in [[Bodic languages]], where it can be used for a variety of functions, including the formation of [[complement clause]]s and [[relative clause]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Noonan|first=Michael|title=Nominalizations in Bodic languages|date=2008|url=https://doi.org/10.1075/tsl.76.11noo|work=Typological Studies in Language|pages=219–237|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|language=English|doi=10.1075/tsl.76.11noo|isbn=9789027229885|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common Bodic nominaliser ''-pa &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Lancey|first=Scott|date=2002|title=Relativization and Nominalization in Bodic|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual Meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society: Special Session on Tibeto-Burman and Southeast Asian Linguistics|volume=|pages=55–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' productively functions in Yolmo as a suffix that can mark [[Yolmo language#Past Tense|past tense]], [[Yolmo language#Question formation|question structures]] or [[Yolmo language#Copula verbs|emphasis]]. There are other nominalising forms in Yolmo.

Hari describes a number of nominalisers in Melamchi Valley Yolmo. The first is the nominalising suffix ''-ka'': 
:{|
|-
|''dì''
|''saudʑi''
|''kár-'''ka'''''
|''yàabu''
|''tér-ku''
|''dù''
|-
|this
|shopkeeper
|weight-'''{{sc|nmlz}}'''
|good
|give-{{sc|ipfv}}
|{{sc|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="6" |‘This shop keeper gives good weight.’ (Hari 2010: 30)
|}

A number of other nominalising suffixes that attach to verbs have more specific functions:
:{| class="wikitable"
!Suffix
!Function
|-
|''-naŋ''
|appearance of state or action
|-
|''-taŋ''
|displaying a forceful show
|-
|''-luŋ''
|have time for an activity 
|-
|''-lu''
|way of doing something
|}
In Lamjung Yolmo the most productive nominaliser is ''-kandi''.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; None of the others described above have been attested. This form is not attested in Hari's description of Melamchi Valley Yolmo, but is probably related to the ''-ka'' form described above.
:{|
|-
|''ŋà=ki''
|''ʈìlbu'' 
|''yúŋ'''-kandi''''' 
|''thé-ku'' 
|''dù'' 
|-
|1{{sc|1=sg=erg}}
|bell
|ring-'''{{sc|nmlz}}'''
|hear-{{sc|ipfv}}
|{{sc|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="5" |‘I hear the ringing of bells.’ (Gawne 2016: 132)
|}

There is also a locative nominaliser ''-sa'', which creates a noun that denotes location:
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''
|''dzàra''
|''sà-'''sa'''=la''
|''ɖò-en''
|-
|1{{sc|sg}}
|snack
|eat-'''{{sc|nmlz.loc}}'''={{sc|loc}}
|go-{{sc|non.pst}}
|-
| colspan="4" |‘I want to go to the snack place.’ (Hari 2010: 33)
|}

=== Adverbials ===
An [[Adverbial|adverbial structure]] modifies the verb in some way.

==== Temporal adverbial subordination ====
Temporal adverbs can create subordinated clauses.

:{|
|-
|''sà-kandi'' 
|'''''tòŋla''''' 
|''ŋà'' 
|''làkpa'' 
|''ʈhú-ke'' 
|-
|eat-{{sc|nmlz}}
|'''before'''
|1{{sc|sg}}
|hand
|wash-{{sc|non.pst}}
|-
| colspan="5" |‘I wash my hands before eating.’ (Gawne 2016: 130)
|}

Below is the list of temporal adverbs observed in Yolmo to date, some are independent words, and others are verbal suffixes:
:{| class="wikitable"
!Adverb
!Translation
!Additional information
|-
|''nàm''
|'when'
|
|-
|''gàrila'' 
|'at the time'
|Nepali loanword
|-
|''bèlala''
|'at the time'
|Nepali loanword
|-
| -''kamu'' 
|'at the time'
|only attested in Lamjung Yolmo
|-
|''tòŋla'' 
|'before'
|
|-
|''tíŋla'' 
|'after'
|
|-
|''-tile'' 
|'after'
|
|-
|''-timaraŋ'' 
|'after'
|
|-
|''yìndʑu''
|'since'
|only attested in Melamchi Valley Yolmo
|}

==== Manner adverbs ====
Manner adverbs create a subordinated clause that expresses the manner of an action. The manner adverb is ''lèemu'' (''lìmu'' in Lamjung).

:{|
|-
|''khúŋ'' 
|''tábu'' 
|'''''límu''''' 
|''gyùbu'' 
|''tɕóŋ-ku'' 
|''dù'' 
|-
|3{{sc|1=pl}}
|house
|'''like'''
|fast
|run-{{sc|1=nmlz}}
|{{sc|1=aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="6" |‘He runs fast like a horse.’ (Gawne 2016: 129)
|}
The forms ''tíle'' and ''dènmu'' are also found in Lamjung Yolmo,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; but not yet attested in other varieties.

=== Conditional ===
[[Conditional sentence|Conditional constructions]] are formed through the use of the suffix ''-na'' on the verb in the [[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] clause (the 'if' clause). Speakers will either use the ''-na'' suffix directly on the verb, or leave the verb unmarked at attach the ''-na'' suffix to the verb meaning ‘say’ (''mée'' in Melamchi Valley Yolmo, ''làp'' in Lamjung Yolmo). 
:{|
|-
|''nám'' 
|''mà-kyàp''
|''làp'''-na''''' 
|''ŋà'' 
|''phíla''
|''ɖò-ke''
|-
|rain
|{{sc|neg.pst}}-fall
|say-'''{{sc|cond}}'''
|1{{sc|sg}}
|outside
|go-{{sc|non.pst}}
|-
| colspan="6" |‘If it doesn’t rain I will go outside.’ (Gawne 2016: 130)
|}

=== Complementation ===
A [[complement clause]] is a clause that functions as an argument of another clause. In Yolmo the embedded complement clause takes the infinitive suffix ''-tɕe''. 
:{|
|-
|''ɲì=la'' 
|''yìgi'' 
|''prù'''-tɕe''''' 
|''ʈèmba sàl-toŋ'' 
|-
|1{{sc|1=pl.excl=dat}}
|letter
|write-'''{{sc|inf}}'''
|remember-{{sc|imp}}
|-
| colspan="4" |‘Remember to write us a letter!’ (Gawne 2016: 134)
|}
The [[Yolmo language#Optative|optative mood suffix ''-ɲi'']] in Yolmo can also be said to be acting as a complementiser.

=== Relativisation ===
A [[relative clause]] is depended on a main clause. Different relativising strategies are used in the two described varieties of Yolmo. In Melamchi Valley Yolmo the non-past tense form ''-ken(-gi)'' is used for non-past constructions, and the past tense form ''-kyo(-gi)'' is used for past tense constructions (for each the ''-gi'' is optional). Similarly, in Lamjung Yolmo, ''-ke-ki'' can be used for non-past relativised clauses and -''pa-ki f''or past relativised clauses. This difference reflects the fact that the past tense form [[Yolmo language#Past Tense|-''kyo'' is not found]] in Lamjung Yolmo.
:{|
|-
|''òze''
|''bèle''
|''aʑi=gi''
|''gòo''
|''thóo=la''
|''tɕáŋ-'''gyo-gi'''''
|''làawor''
|''phók''
|''táŋ-sin''
|''&lt;nowiki/&gt;dù''
|''ló''

|{{Smallcaps|rs}}
|-
| colspan="11" | 'At that moment (the monster) swiftly loosened the mill stone which was hanging just above the head of the elder sister.' (Hari 2010: 76)
|}
:{|
|-
|''khyá=ki'' 
|''prù-prù'''-pa-ki''''' 
|''yìgi'' 
|-
|{{Smallcaps|1=2pl=gen}}
| write-write-'''{{Smallcaps|rel}}'''|| letter
|-
| colspan="3" | 'The letter that you wrote.' (Gawne 2016: 134)
|}
In Lamjung Yolmo, the nominaliser ''-kandi'' can be used to make a relative clause:
:{|
|-
|''khím'' 
|''sáŋma'' 
|''pè'''-kandi''''' 
|''mì'' 
|''nà-sin'' 
|''dù'' 
|-
|house
| clean|| do='''{{Smallcaps|nmlz}}'''
|person
|ill-{{Smallcaps|pst}}
|{{Smallcaps|aux.pe}}
|-
| colspan="6" | 'The person who cleans the house is ill.' (Gawne 2016: 135)
|}

=== Clause chaining ===
The [[Yolmo language#Perfective|perfective suffix ''-ti'']] is used to chain clauses together. Multiple verbs with this suffix can be stacked to create a complex series of events.

:{|
|-
|''tɕádzuŋma'' 
|''tɕíi'' 
|''òŋ-'''ti''''' 
|''ʈúu'''-ti''''' 
|''khér-sin'' 
|-
|bird
| one|| come-'''{{Smallcaps|pftv}}'''
|pick.up-'''{{Smallcaps|pftv}}'''
|carry.away-{{Smallcaps|pst}}
|-
| colspan="5" | 'A bird came, picked up (a fish) and took (it) away.' (Gawne 2016: 136)
|}

=== Question formation ===
Word order does not change to form questions in Yolmo. Rising intonation at the end of the utterance can indicate it is a question. [[Yolmo language#Interrogative pronouns|A set of interrogative pronouns]] are used for open content questions.

The ''-pa'' suffix, which was introduced in the section on [[Yolmo language#Past Tense|past tense]] is used in question structures.

:{|
|-
|''khé'' 
|''tó'' 
|''sà'''-pa''''' 
|-
|2{{Smallcaps|sg}}
|rice.cooked
|eat'''{{Smallcaps|-q}}'''
|-
| colspan="3" |‘Did you eat cooked rice?’ (Gawne 2016: 139)
|}
The reply would be with the regular past tense, and not the ''-pa'' suffix:
:{|
|-
|''ŋà''
|''tó'' 
|''sà'''-sin''''' 
|-
|1{{Smallcaps|sg}}
|rice.cooked
|eat'''{{Smallcaps|-pst}}'''
|-
| colspan="3" |‘I ate rice.’ (Gawne 2016: 139)

The [[Yolmo language#Copula verbs|copula form]] used in a question matches the form the question-asked anticipates the question-answerer will use in their answer. That is, if they anticipate the answer will use the perceptual evidential ''dù'', this is the form they will use in asking the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2016|title=Questions and answers in Lamjung Yolmo|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378216616300820|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=101|pages=31–53|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2016.04.002|issn=0378-2166|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reported speech ===
Yolmo has two strategies for reporting speech, the first is using the lexical verb ''má'' or ''làp'' 'say', the second is using the [[Yolmo language#Clause final particles|clause final evidential particle]] ''ló.''&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gawne|first=Lauren|date=2015|title=The reported speech evidential particle in Lamjung Yolmo|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ltba.38.2.09gaw|journal=Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=292–318|doi=10.1075/ltba.38.2.09gaw|issn=0731-3500|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lexical verb ====
In Melamchi Valley Yolmo the main lexical verb of saying is ''má,'' in Lamjung Yolmo it is ''làp''. Hari and Lama note that ''làp'' is found in Melamchi Valley Yolmo, but in restricted use.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If the speaker, and the person the speech is directed at are overtly marked, these usually proceed the reported content (although they are frequently not overt in natural speech). The 'say' verb prototypically occurs after the reported content, although if the reported content is quite long the verb may occasionally come before it.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

|}
The lexical verb 'say' is also used in a number of other constructions, including [[Yolmo language#Conditional|conditionals]].

==== Reported speech evidential ====
The reported speech particle also indicates that the speaker is reporting a prior utterance, but has a different focus. The reported speech particle does not account for who the speaker way, but instead primarily serves to focus on the fact the information is reported, and not directly witnessed by the speaker. In the example below from Syuba, it is not made explicit if the report comes from Maila, or another person. The reported speech evidential occurs frequently in narratives.

|}

This is part of the wider evidential system of Yolmo, which is also found in the [[Yolmo language#Copula verbs|copula verbs]] above.

=== Lexical emphasis ===
There are two emphatic suffixes that can be used with a number of word classes. This is in contrast to the [[Yolmo language#Focus marker|emphatic form ''-ti'']], which is only used with nouns. The first is ''-ni, and'' the second is ''-raŋ'', which Hari &amp; Lama note is a frequently used emphatic marker in informal speech.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The distinction between all of these forms is unclear, although Hari refers to the ''-ni'' form as used for 'moderate focus',&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; so it is perhaps less emphatic for nouns than the ''-ti'' suffix.

=== Clause final particles ===
Yolmo has a series of sentence final [[Grammatical particle|particles]] that can be used to achieve a range of effects. The table below gives some of the particles in Yolmo and a brief description of their function.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawne"/&gt;
::{| class="wikitable"
!Particle
!Function
|-
|''ló''
|reported speech
|-
|''nà''
|emphasis/insistence
|-
|''yàŋ''
|emphasis/focus
|-
|''làa''
|polite
|-
|''lé''
|pleading
|-
|''lò''
|friendly/encouraging
|-
|''óo''
|invoking/encouraging
|}
The reported speech marker ''ló ''is an [[Evidentiality|evidential]] form, as it indicates the source of the information as someone else. This structure is described in the section on [[Yolmo language#Reported speech|reported speech]].

== Honorifics ==
Yolmo has a subset of [[Honorifics (linguistics)|honorific]] vocabulary which is used when talking to, or about, people of higher social status, particularly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Lama]]s. Honorific lexicon includes nouns, verbs and adjectives. The table below gives some examples, including the regular word, the honorific form, and the English translation.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;
:{| class="wikitable"
!Regular form
!Honorific form

|-
|''tér''
|''nàŋ''
|'give'
|-
|''ɲí lòo''
|''zìm''
|'sleep'
|-

|''ɕè'' 
|'eat'

|'foot/leg'
|-
|''gòo''
|''ú''
|'head'
|-
|''ɕìmbu''
|''ɲéebu''
|'tasty'
|}

The use of honorifics in Syuba and Lamjung Yolmo is not as common, although some speakers still recognise and use these forms.&lt;ref name="Gawne"/&gt;

== 100 word Swadesh list ==
Below is a 100 word [[Swadesh list]] in Yolmo. The Yolmo forms are taken from Hari and Lama,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; who note some variation between the Eastern (E) and Western (W) varieties in the Melamchi and Helambu Valley area. Where the form is different in other varieties this is indicated in the right-hand column of the table. This variation shows that the Lamjung variety and Syuba have more in common with each other lexically than they do with the Melamchi Valley variety.

== Numbers ==
Yolmo has a base-20 counting system.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yohlmo-Nepali-English Dictionary|last=Hari|first=Anna Maria|last2=Lama|first2=Chhegu|publisher=Central Department of Linguistics|year=2004|isbn=|location=Kathmandu|pages=710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yolmo number system is very similar to that of Standard Tibetan and other Tibetan varieties. In the table below is the Yolmo number, taken from Hari's dictionary.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

In Lamjung Yolmo, the base-20 system is only used by a small number of older speakers, with others using a base-10 system. For example, 'twenty' is ''ɲídʑu'', 'thirty' is ''súmdʑu'', 'forty' is ''ɕíptɕu'', etc. Even then, once people reach 20 the usually switch to counting in Nepali.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Ordinal numbers are formed by addition of the suffix ''-pa'', or alternatively with the suffix ''-pu'' for ordinals relating to people, in Melamchi Yolmo. Ordinals are typically only formed up to 20.

'''Yossi Abulafia''' ({{lang-he|יוסי אבולעפיה}}; born 1944) is an Israeli writer and illustrator of children's books, as well as a graphic artist, cartoonist, director and screenwriter of [[animation film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/47/ART1/889/897.html|title=Made Comfort and Me – Interview with Yossi Abulafia|last=Sapphire-Weitz|first=Carmit|date=May 13, 2009|publisher=Nrg|language=Hebrew|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Abulafia was born in [[Tiberias]] in 1944 in what was then the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. At age 17, he was accepted to Israel's national school of art "[[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]]". He graduated from the school after majoring graphic design for 4 years. After his military service Abulafia began to work in the Israeli [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel 1]] as graphic artist and cartoonist.

==Work==
In 1975 Abulafia illustrated the back cover for [[Kaveret]]'s third album ''[[Crowded in the Ear]]'' (צפוף באוזן) which was a collage of images illustrating the various songs on the album in the style of the famous [[Monty Python]] illustrations done by [[Terry Gilliam]].

Towards the mid-1980s Abulafia moved to North America, where he worked for six years as an animation producer and as a director in both Canada and the United States. During these years Abulafia began to illustrate and write children's books, both for Israelis and for Americans.

In 1990 Abulafia published the children's book ''HaKina Nechama'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: Nechama the Head Louse) which was written by [[Meir Shalev]] and illustrated by Abulafia. The book, which humorously describes the adventures of a [[head louse]], became very popular and influential in Israel and was adapted to other media numerous times.
