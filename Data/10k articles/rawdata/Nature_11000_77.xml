'''{{mp|(33342) 1998 WT|24}}''' is a bright, sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] (PHA) of the [[Aten asteroid|Aten group]], located in [[Venus]]'s zone of influence that has frequent close encounters with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], Venus, and [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It made a close approach to Earth on 11 December 2015, passing at a distance of about 4.2 million kilometers (2.6 million miles, 11 lunar distances)&lt;ref name=jpl-2015/&gt; and reaching about [[apparent magnitude]] 11.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2015"/&gt;

The asteroid was discovered on November 25, 1998, by [[LINEAR]] about four months after a close encounter with the planet Mercury (about 0.047 [[astronomical unit|AU]]).&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It measures approximately 400 meters in diameter. It is also one of the best studied PHAs and was the 10th Aten asteroid to be [[Minor planet designation|numbered]].

== Classification and orbit ==
[[File:(33342) 1998 WT24 bistatic radar image.gif|left|250px|thumb|Radar observation during 2001 encounter]]

{{mp|1998 WT|24}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.42–1.02&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 7 months (222 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 0.72&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.42 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 7[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

=== Low aphelion ===

At the time of its discovery, astronomers were trying to find the first [[Apohele asteroid]] (one that is always closer to the [[Sun]] than Earth). All asteroids known at the time that got closer to the Sun than Earth also crossed Earth's orbit. Earlier that year, [[David J. Tholen]] claimed to have spotted the first Apohele asteroid, which was dubbed {{mpl|1998 DK|36}}. However, the object was lost without being confirmed. Thus, [[1993 DA]] remained the asteroid with the lowest known [[aphelion]] at 1.023 AU. When {{mp|1998 WT|24}} was discovered, it was found to have a slightly smaller aphelion (1.019 AU) than 1993 DA, and was thus the closest thing to an Apohele asteroid known at the time. It lost its smallest aphelion title almost immediately when {{mpl|(415713) 1998 XX|2}} was discovered only a few weeks later (aphelion = 1.014 AU). Asteroids with even smaller aphelions were discovered until February 2003, when finally, an asteroid with an aphelion smaller than 1.000 AU was discovered. This was [[163693 Atira]], the first confirmed Apohele asteroid.

=== Venus zone of influence ===

{{mp|1998 WT|24}} was the second asteroid discovered to be close enough to [[Venus]] as to be within the major planet's zone of influence. It is located at about the inner edge of the zone, while [[(99907) 1989 VA]], the first asteroid discovered there, is at about the outer edge. It is possible for planets to capture asteroids located in their sphere of influences into co-orbital relationships such as [[Trojan asteroid|Trojan]] and [[horseshoe orbit|horseshoe]] asteroids. Because of its frequent close encounters with Mercury and Earth, however, it may prove difficult for Venus to keep {{mp|1998 WT|24}} in a co-orbital relationship for any length of time. Of the six objects in Venus's zone of influence, only one ({{mpl|2002 VE|68}}) is currently a co-orbital.

=== Record close encounter ===

{{mp|1998 WT|24}} is a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]]. That means its orbit takes it very close to Earth and if it were to collide with our planet, it would cause devastation on at least a regional scale. On December 16, 2001,&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; it became the first PHA to be observed passing within 5 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distances]] (the average distance between Earth and the [[Moon]]) from Earth. Other asteroids have come closer, and numerous have even come closer than the Moon, but these have all been small asteroids, incapable of causing much damage to the planet, or much concern. The 2001 encounter was the closest known approach to Earth any PHA had made since {{mpl|(192642) 1999 RD|32}} passed by on August 27, 1969.&lt;ref name=NASA20011214/&gt; However, {{mp|1999 RD|32}} was not discovered until September 1999 many years after its closest approach, so no one knew about {{mp|1999 RD|32}} in 1969.

In September 2004, the well known PHA [[4179 Toutatis]] came about 4 Lunar Distances from Earth. Due to its diameter being over ten times larger (5.7&amp;nbsp;km) and its closer approach, Toutatis at its closest (mag 8.9) was about half an [[apparent magnitude]] brighter than {{mp|1998 WT|24}} was at its closest (mag 9.5).&lt;ref name=NASA20011214/&gt; However, Toutatis arrived during a full moon, and thus {{mp|1998 WT|24}}'s 2001 encounter is still the most easily observed flyby of an asteroid in history. It also made {{mp|1998 WT|24}} the first [[Near-Earth asteroid]] observed to be brighter than magnitude 10.

=== Frequent inner-planet encounters ===

{{mp|1998 WT|24}} is a [[Mercury-crosser asteroid]], a [[Venus-crosser asteroid]], and an [[Earth-crosser asteroid]]. Because of its relatively low inclination (7.34°), it is able to come close to each of these planets. Its orbit takes it within 0.021 AU of Mercury's orbit, 0.0368 AU of Venus's orbit, and 0.00989 AU of Earth's orbit. It makes frequent encounters with these inner planets. The last time it came close to Mercury, Venus and Earth was 2010, 1977, and November 12, 2004 respectively.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; The most recent close approach to Earth was on 11 December 2015 at about 4.2 million kilometers (2.6 million miles, 11 lunar distances). The next visit of the asteroid to Earth's neighborhood will be on 11 November 2018, when it will make a relatively distant pass at about 20 million kilometers (12.5 million miles, 52 lunar distances).&lt;ref name=jpl-2015/&gt; These encounters [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturb]] its orbit parameters slightly, and each pass reduces its inclination further.

== Physical characteristics ==

During its close encounters in 2001 and 2015, astronomers were able to make radar images of its surface and determine physical properties that remain unknown for most asteroids.&lt;ref name=jpl-2015 /&gt; According to the ExploreNEOs Warm Spitzer Exploration Science program, {{mp|1998 WT|24}} is a bright [[E-type asteroid]] with an exceptionally high albedo of {{val|0.75|0.35}}.&lt;ref name="Thomas-2011b" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

{{mp|1998 WT|24}} measures between 350 and 415 meters in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.34 and 0.75.&lt;ref name="Harris-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Busch-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas-2011b" /&gt;{{efn|name=lcdb-Robinson-2011}} The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' an albedo of 0.34 and takes a diameter of 410 meters based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 18.69.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; The asteroid is modestly elongated, approximately 420&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;330 meters.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

=== Rotation period ===

Several rotational [[lightcurve]]s of {{mp|1998 WT|24}} have been obtained from radiometric and photometric observations.&lt;ref name="Busch-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner-2016e" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krugly-2002b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geneva-obs" /&gt;{{efn|name=lcdb-Pravec-2001}}{{efn|name=lcdb-Robinson-2011}} Lightcurve analysis gave a consolidated [[rotation period]] of 3.697 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.19 and 0.65 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3]]}}).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;{{efn|name=lightcurve-plots-Warner}}

== Future flyby candidate ==

{{mp|1998 WT|24}} has an orbit that not only crosses Earth's orbit, but is roughly parallel to it at its furthest. This means that during favourable years it is easy to reach from Earth. Several times this decade, it will be an easier target than Earth's own Moon. It is high on the list of possible Near-Earth Asteroid targets for future flybys, landings, mining, or orbit manipulations.

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was [[Minor planet designation|numbered]] by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 28 January 2002.&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; As of 2018, it has not been [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''1566 Icarus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|k|ər|ə|s}} {{respell|IK|ə-rəs}}), provisional designation {{mp|1949 MA}}, is an extremely eccentric [[asteroid]], approximately 1.4 kilometers in diameter. It is a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]] and the lowest numbered [[potentially hazardous asteroid]].&lt;ref name="MPC-PHA-list" /&gt; In 1968, it became the first asteroid ever observed by radar.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; Its orbit brings it closer to the Sun than Mercury and further out than the orbit of Mars, which also makes it a [[List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|Mercury-]], [[List of Venus-crossing minor planets|Venus-]], and [[Mars-crosser]]. This stony asteroid and relatively [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]] was discovered by German astronomer [[Walter Baade]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]], California, on 27 June 1949.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; It was named after the mythological boy [[Icarus]], who flew too close to the Sun.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==
[[File:1566 Icarus orbit.gif|thumb|left|Orbital diagram of ''Icarus'']]

''Icarus'' orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.2–2.0&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 1 years and 1 month (409 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.83 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 23[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with its official discovery observation at Palomar.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

At [[perihelion]], ''Icarus'' comes closer to the [[Sun]] than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], i.e. it is a [[Mercury-crossing asteroid]]. It is also a [[Venus-crosser asteroid|Venus]] and [[Mars-crosser asteroid|Mars-crosser]]. From 1949 until the discovery of [[3200&amp;nbsp;Phaethon]] in 1983, it was known as the asteroid that passed closest to the Sun. Since then hundreds of Mercury-crossers have been found, the closest ones are now being {{mpl|2005 HC|4}} and {{mpl|(394130) 2006 HY|51}} ''(also see {{section link|List of Mercury-crossing minor planets|List}})''.

=== Meteor shower ===

''Icarus'' is thought to be the source of the [[Arietids]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceweather.com/meteors/arietids.html Daylight Meteors: The Arietids @spaceweather.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a strong daylight [[meteor shower]]. However other objects such as the short-period sun-grazing comet [[96P/Machholz]] are also possible candidates for the shower's origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8197785/ On the Association among Periodic Comet 96P/Machholz, Arietids, the Marsden Comet Group, and the Kracht Comet Group]&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Close approaches ===

''Icarus'' has an ''Earth [[minimum orbital intersection distance]]'' of {{convert|0.0352 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=on}}, which translates into 13.7 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] (LD).&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; This [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] makes close approaches to [[Earth]] in June at intervals of 9, 19, or 28 years.

In 14 June 1968, it came as close as {{convert|0.042482 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=on}}, or 16&amp;nbsp;LD.&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt; During this approach, Icarus became the first minor planet to be observed using [[radar]], with measurements obtained at the [[Haystack Observatory]]&lt;ref name="Pettengill-1969" /&gt; and the [[Goldstone Tracking Station]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein-1968" /&gt;

The last close approach was on 16 June 2015, when ''Icarus'' passed Earth at {{convert|0.05383 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off}} or 22&amp;nbsp;LD.&lt;ref name="Greenberg-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt; Before that, the previous close approach was on 11 June 1996, at {{convert|0.10119 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off}}, almost 40 times as far as the Moon. The next notably close approach will be on 13 June 2043, at {{convert|0.0586 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

Radiometric observation characterized ''Icarus'' as a stony [[S-type asteroid|S-type]] and [[Q-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="Mahapatra-1999" /&gt;

=== Rotation period ===

Since 1968, several rotational [[lightcurve]]s of ''Icarus'' were obtained from photometric and radiometric observations.&lt;ref name="Miner-1969" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gehrels-1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="De-Angelis-1995a" /&gt; During the asteroid's close approach in June 2017, observations of the fast-moving object were taken by Italian astronomers Virginio Oldani and Federico Manzini, [[Brian D. Warner|Brian Warner]] at the Palmer Divide Station ({{small|[[IAU code#U82|U82]]}}) in California, and by Australian astronomers at the Darling Range and Blue Mountains Observatories ({{small|[[IAU code#Q68|Q68]]}}).&lt;ref name="geneva-obs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Warner-2015r" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oey-2017b" /&gt;{{efn|name=ligthcurve-plot-Warner}}

Lightcurve analysis gave it a consolidated [[rotation period]] of 2.2726 hours with a brightness variation of 0.22 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3]]}}).&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;{{efn|name=ligthcurve-plot-Warner}} ''Icarus'' is a relatively [[List of fast rotators (minor planets)|fast rotator]], near the threshold where non-solid [[rubble pile]]s fly apart.

=== Spin axis ===

In 2015, radiometric observations at the [[Goldstone Observatory]] in California found a [[Poles of astronomical bodies|spin axis]] of (270.0°, −81.0°) in [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic coordinates]] (λ,&amp;thinsp;β).&lt;ref name="Greenberg-2017" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to several radiometric and photometric observations, including the survey carried out by the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], ''Icarus'' measures between 1.0 and 1.44 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] between 0.14 and 0.51.&lt;ref name="Nugent-2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris-1998a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainzer-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg-2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas-2011b" /&gt;{{efn|name=Gehrels}}

The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' adopts the radiometric results obtained at Goldstone Observatory in June 2015, which gave an albedo of 0.14 and a diameter of 1.44 kilometers based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 16.96.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt; Goldstone observations also gave the body's dimensions: 1.61&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;1.60&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;1.17 kilometers.&lt;ref name="Greenberg-2017" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after [[Icarus]], son of [[Daedalus]] ''(also see [[1864 Daedalus]])'' from [[Greek mythology]]. They attempted to escape prison by means of wings constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the Sun. When the wax in his wings melted he fell into the sea and drowned.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The naming was suggested by R. C. Cameron and Dr. Folkman. The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] before November 1977 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 347}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt; Both mythological figures are honored with the lunar craters ''[[Icarus (crater)|Icarus]]'' and ''[[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus]]''.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Research interests ==

''Icarus'' is being studied to better understand [[general relativity]], solar oblateness, and [[Yarkovsky effect|Yarkovsky drift]].&lt;ref name="ucla"/&gt; [[Apsidal precession#General relativity|Perihelion precession]], caused by general relativity, in the case of Icarus is 10.05 [[arcsecond]]s per [[Julian century]].&lt;ref name="ucla"/&gt;

== Project Icarus ==

"Project Icarus" was a student project conducted at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in the spring of 1967, to defend against risks from {{mp|1566 Icarus}}.

This project was an assignment by Paul Sandorff for his group of Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate students in a systems engineering class to devise a plan to use rockets to deflect or destroy ''Icarus'' in the case that it was found to be on a collision course with planet Earth.&lt;ref name=kleiman&gt;Kleiman, Louis A., [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6840 ''Project Icarus: an MIT Student Project in Systems Engineering''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017105104/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6840 |date=October 17, 2007 }}, Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843952,00.html "Systems Engineering: Avoiding an Asteroid"], ''Time'' magazine, June 16, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;Day, Dwayne A., [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/175/1 "Giant bombs on giant rockets: Project Icarus"], ''The Space Review'', Monday, July 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine ran an article on the endeavor in June 1967&lt;ref name=time/&gt; and the following year the student report was published as a book.&lt;ref name=kleiman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6840 Project Icarus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017105104/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=6840 |date=October 17, 2007 }}, MIT Report No. 13, MIT Press 1968, edited by Louis A. Kleiman. "Interdepartmental Student Project in Systems Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Spring Term, 1967"; reissued 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of their study the students visited the [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, where they were so impressed with the [[Vertical Assembly Building]] that they wrote of "the awesome reality" that had "completely erased" their doubts over using the technology associated with the [[Apollo program]] and [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David S.

'''2009 RR''' micro-[[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]].&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It was discovered on 11 September 2009 by the [[Catalina Sky Survey]] at an [[apparent magnitude]] of 19.5 using a {{convert|0.68|m|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope]].&lt;ref name="MPEC2009-R39"/&gt; {{mp|2009 RR}} was the only asteroid discovered before 2014 that was predicted to potentially pass [[List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2014|inside the orbit of the Moon]] during 2014. The asteroid has an estimated diameter of {{convert|26|m|sp=us}} and is listed on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]].&lt;ref name="summary"/&gt; It is not large enough to qualify as a [[potentially hazardous object]].

== Description ==

With an observation arc of only 4 days, the asteroid has a [[Uncertainty Parameter U|poorly determined orbit]].&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt; It is already known that there is no risk of an Earth [[Impact event|impact]] before 2098.&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; The power of such an [[air burst]] would be somewhere between the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]] and the [[Tunguska event]] depending on the actual size of the asteroid.

The [[Curve fitting|nominal]] orbit shows that on 16 September 2014 the asteroid could have passed just inside one [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distance]] from Earth,&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; but the orbital uncertainties show that it could have passed as much as {{convert|0.1|AU|km mi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name=jpl-close/&gt; On 9 September 2014 the [[full moon]] may have only be 15 degrees from the 20th magnitude asteroid, making it difficult to detect the asteroid.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; The asteroid was estimated to be brighter than magnitude 20 from 10 September until 16 September 2014.&lt;ref name="NEODyS2014"/&gt; {{mp|2009 RR}} was not recovered during the 2014 approach and thus probably passed more than one lunar distance from Earth.

'''{{mp|2012 UE|34}}''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as a [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately 70 meters in diameter. It was first observed on 18 October 2012, by [[Pan-STARRS]] at [[Haleakala Observatory]] on the island of Maui, Hawaii, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The object was removed from the [[Sentry Risk Table]] on 29 December 2013.&lt;ref name="removed" /&gt; Due to its presumed small size, it does not qualify as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]], despite its low Earth [[MOID]] of 0.1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Description ==

{{mp|2012 UE|34}} is an [[Apollo asteroid]], which are [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crossers]] and the largest subgroup in the [[near-Earth object]] population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.00–1.22&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 14 months (424 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.11&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.10 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 10[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins with its official first observation at Haleakala in October 2012.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

=== Close encounters ===

{{mp|2012 UE|34}} passed about {{convert |0.002 |AU|km mi |abbr=on |lk=off |order=flip}} from Earth on 8 April 1991.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; On 8 April 2041, the asteroid will pass about {{convert |0.0007 |AU|km mi |abbr=on |lk=off |order=flip}} from Earth. For comparison, the distance to the [[Moon]] is about 0.0026 AU (384,400&amp;nbsp;km).

It has an exceptionally low [[minimum orbital intersection distance]] with Earth of {{convert|0.0002 |AU |km |abbr=on |lk=off}}, which translates into 0.1 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar distances]]. Despite this exceptionally low theoretical distance, the asteroid is not listed as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]], due to its small size, represented by its proxy, an [[absolute magnitude]] of 23.3, which is too faint and above the defined threshold of 22 magnitude.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

Based on its incoming velocity (14.6&amp;nbsp;km/s) and energy, the original asteroid was likely between 2.2 and 3.6 meters across,&lt;ref name="impactcalculator"&gt;{{cite web|title=Asteroid Impact Crater Calculator - calculates the effects of the impact of an object hitting the earth|url=http://convertalot.com/asteroid_impact_calculator.html|website=convertalot.com|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; slightly smaller than the [[2015 Thailand bolide]], which fell about 2 years previously, several hundred miles to the south.

This is the largest recorded meteor to fall over China since the 2000 bolide, which radiated about 262 [[Joule|gigajoules]] of energy compared to the 2017 event's 192. While it was only the 5th most energetic impact event of 2017, it was the largest one to occur over land, and a populated area no less.&lt;ref name="jpl"/&gt;

It has found wide use in tube radios and early [[guitar amplifiers]] (of the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] Champ type).  It is virtually identical, electrically, to the older four-pin type 80 tube, but with an [[octal]] [[valve base|base]]. 5Y3G, 5Y3GT, and 5Y3WGTA are variants with essentially the same specification;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/static/web05.htm National Valve Museum, equivalents beginning "5"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203211801/http://www.r-type.org/static/web05.htm |date=February 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the 6087 is similar and a plug-in replacement, but with indirectly heated cathode.

RCA and other manufacturers later introduced many similar 5V rectifier tubes of both higher and lower current and voltage rating, including the 5V3, 5W3, 5X3, 5Z3, 5U4, 5Z4, GZ32, and GZ34.

As for a suitable replacement, the 5Y4G has same specifications as the 5Y3G but with a different pin out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/155/5/5Y3GT.pdf 5Y3GT data]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://frank.pocnet.net/sheets/049/5/5Y4GT.pdf 5Y4GT data]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sovtek]] in Russia manufacture a 5Y3GT with similar specifications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svetlana.com/ProductHighLight.aspx?ProId=155 New Sensor: brief Sovtek 5Y3GT specification. Filament current misprinted; actually 2A.]&lt;/ref&gt; but indirectly heated, and with higher maximum current at 140 instead of 120&amp;nbsp;mA.{{dubious|date=August 2016}}

'''Batemans Bay''' is an open [[bay|oceanic embayment]] that is located in the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]] region of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. The bay forms the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the [[Clyde River (New South Wales)|Clyde River]] and its primary outflow is to the [[Tasman Sea]] of the [[South Pacific Ocean]].

==Location and features==
Batemans Bay is fed by the Clyde River and its tributaries, drawing its catchment from the eastern slopes of the [[Budawang Range]] and the [[Great Dividing Range]] from within the [[Budawang National Park|Budawang]], [[Clyde River National Park|Clyde River]], [[Bimberamala National Park|Bimberamala]], and [[Monga National Park|Monga]] national parks.&lt;ref name=bonzle&gt;{{cite web|title=Map of Batemans Bay, NSW|url=http://www.bonzle.com/c/a?a=p&amp;p=37208&amp;cmd=sp|work=Bonzle Digital Atlas of Australia|year=2013|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gnb&gt;{{NSW GNR|id=anKqZxUl|title=Batemans Bay|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cullendulla Creek also flows into Batemans Bay, between the townships of Surfside and Longbeach, west of Square Head.&lt;ref name=ATSILEP /&gt;

The total catchment area of the bay is approximately {{convert|28|km2}} and the bay holds an estimated {{convert|383484|ML}} of water at an average depth of {{convert|11.1|m}}. The surface area of the bay comprises {{convert|34.5|km2}}&lt;ref name=environ /&gt; and generally stretches from the [[confluence]] of the Clyde River with the bay east of the town of Batemans Bay, near Snapper Island; to its mouth with the Tasman Sea at the Tollgate Islands, located between North Head and Circuit Beach.

==History==
The traditional custodians of the land surrounding Batemans Bay are the [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] [[Yuin people]] of the Walbunja clan. A number of sites surrounding the bay are considered culturally significant to the Aboriginal peoples.&lt;ref name=ATSILEP&gt;{{cite web|title=Hanging Rock Catalina |work=Preliminary Public Aboriginal Heritage Inventory |publisher=[[Eurobodalla Shire Council]] |date=April 2009 |accessdate=25 May 2013 |url=http://www.esc.nsw.gov.au/site/AboriginalHeritageStudy/pdf/stage4/Part%201.pdf |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 1770, European explorer, [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]] first sighted the bay when navigating his way around Australia on his ship, [[HMS Endeavour|HMS ''Endeavour'']]. Cook may have named the bay in honour of Nathaniel Bateman; the captain of [[HMS Northumberland (1750)|HMS ''Northumberland'']] at the time when Cook was serving as her master from 1760-62.&lt;ref name=gnb /&gt;&lt;ref name="InletEludedBass"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Dennis|year=2002|url= http://www.southcoast.com.au/batemansbay/bassinlet/index.html|title=The Inlet That Eluded Bass, Batemans Bay - South Coast NSW|publisher=Morningside Internet|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the name was chosen in honour of [[John Bateman, 2nd Viscount Bateman]], a former [[Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty]] in the 1750s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Captain Cook's War and Peace | first =John | last =Robson | coauthors= | month = | year =2009 | publisher =University of New South Wales Press | page=107 | url = | isbn =9781742231099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], '''Ceres''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪər|iː|z}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ceres |encyclopedia=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |year=2014 |url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Ceres }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ceres |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries |year= |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Ceres }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-la|Cerēs}} {{IPA-la|ˈkɛreːs|}}) was a [[goddess]] of [[Roman agriculture|agriculture]], [[cereal|grain crops]], fertility and motherly relationships.&lt;ref name=Whos&gt;Room, Adrian, ''Who's Who in Classical Mythology'', p. 89-90. NTC Publishing 1990. {{ISBN|0-8442-5469-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She was originally the central deity in Rome's so-called [[plebs|plebeian]] or [[Aventine Triad]], then was paired with her daughter [[Proserpina]] in what Romans described as "the Greek rites of Ceres". Her seven-day April [[Roman festivals|festival]] of [[Cerealia]] included the popular ''[[Ludi]] Ceriales'' (Ceres' games). She was also honoured in the May ''[[lustratio]]'' of the fields at the [[Ambarvalia]] festival, at harvest-time, and during [[Marriage in ancient Rome|Roman marriages]] and [[Roman funerals and burial|funeral rites]].

Ceres is the only one of Rome's many [[List of Roman agricultural deities|agricultural deities]] to be listed among the [[Dii Consentes]], Rome's equivalent to the [[Twelve Olympians]] of Greek mythology. The Romans saw her as the counterpart of the Greek goddess [[Demeter]],&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; whose [[Greek mythology|mythology]] was [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreted]] for Ceres in [[Roman art]] and [[Latin literature|literature]].&lt;ref name=Whos /&gt;

==Etymology and origins==
Ceres' name derives from the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European root]] ''*ḱerh₃-'', meaning "to satiate, to feed",&lt;ref&gt;[[Lexikon der Indogermanischen Verben]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is also the root for Latin ''crescere'' "to grow" and through it, the English words ''create'' and ''increase''. Roman etymologists thought ''ceres'' derived from the Latin verb ''gerere'', "to bear, bring forth, produce", because the goddess was linked to [[pastoralism|pastoral]], agricultural and human fertility. Archaic cults to Ceres are well-evidenced among Rome's neighbours in the [[Kingdom of Rome|Regal period]], including the ancient [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], [[Oscans]] and [[Sabellians]], less certainly among the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and [[Umbrians]]. An archaic [[Falisci|Faliscan]] inscription of c. 600 BC asks her to provide ''far'' ([[spelt]] wheat), which was a dietary staple of the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]]. Throughout the Roman era, Ceres' name was synonymous with grain and, by extension, with bread.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1990, pp. 1, 33, 182. See also Spaeth, 1996, pp. 1–4, 33–34, 37. Spaeth disputes the identification of Ceres with warlike, protective Umbrian deities named on the [[Iguvine Tablets]], and Gantz' identification of Ceres as one of six figures shown on a terracotta plaque at Etruscan [[Murlo]] ([[Poggio Civitate]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cults and cult themes==

===Agricultural fertility===
Ceres was credited with the discovery of [[spelt]] wheat (Latin ''far''), the yoking of oxen and ploughing, the sowing, protection and nourishing of the young seed, and the gift of agriculture to humankind; before this, it was said, man had subsisted on acorns, and wandered without settlement or laws. She had the power to fertilise, multiply and fructify plant and animal seed, and her laws and rites protected all activities of the agricultural cycle. In January, Ceres was offered spelt wheat and a pregnant sow, along with the earth-goddess [[Terra Mater|Tellus]], at the movable ''[[Feria]]e [[Sementivae]]''. This was almost certainly held before the annual sowing of grain. The divine portion of sacrifice was the entrails ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#exta|exta]])'' presented in an earthenware pot ''([[Olla (Roman pot)|olla]]).''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], in [[Jörg Rüpke|Rüpke, Jörg]] (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p 264; and Varro, ''Lingua Latina'', 5.98.&lt;/ref&gt; In a rural context, [[Cato the Elder]] describes the offer to Ceres of a ''porca praecidanea'' (a pig, offered before the sowing).&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, p. 35: "The pregnant victim is a common offering to female fertility divinities and was apparently intended, on the principle of sympathetic magic, to fertilise and multiply the seeds committed to the earth." See also Cato the Elder, ''On Agriculture'', 134, for the ''porca praecidanea''.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the harvest, she was offered a propitiary grain sample (''praemetium'').&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 35–39: the offer of ''praemetium'' to Ceres is thought to have been an ancient Italic practice. In Festus, "Praemetium [is] that which was measured out beforehand for the sake of [the goddess] tasting it beforehand".&lt;/ref&gt; Ovid tells that Ceres "is content with little, provided that her offerings are [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#castus, castitas|casta]]" (pure).&lt;ref&gt;Linderski, J., in Wolfgang Haase, Hildegard Temporini (eds), ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'', Volume 16, Part 3, de Gruyter, 1986, p. 1947, citing Ovid, Fasti, 4.411 - 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceres' main festival, [[Cerealia]], was held from mid to late April. It was organised by her [[plebeian]] [[aedile]]s and included circus games (''[[Ludi|ludi circenses]]''). It opened with a horse-race in the [[Circus Maximus]], whose starting point lay below and opposite to her Aventine Temple;&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, 1995, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; the turning post at the far end of the Circus was sacred to [[Consus]], a god of grain-storage. After the race, foxes were released into the Circus, their tails ablaze with lighted torches, perhaps to cleanse the growing crops and protect them from disease and vermin, or to add warmth and vitality to their growth.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 36–37. Ovid offers a myth by way of explanation: long ago, at ancient Carleoli, a farm-boy caught a fox stealing chickens and tried to burn it alive. The fox escaped and fired the fields and their crops, which were sacred to Ceres. Ever since (says Ovid) foxes are punished at her festival.&lt;/ref&gt; From c.175 BC, Cerealia included ''[[ludi scaenici]]'' (theatrical religious events) through April 12 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;A plebeian aedile, C. Memmius, claims credit for Ceres' first ludi scaeneci. He celebrated the event with the dole of a new commemorative [[denarius]]; his claim to have given "the first Cerealia" represents this innovation. See Spaeth, 1996, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Helper gods====
In the ancient ''sacrum cereale'' a priest, probably the [[Flamen|Flamen Cerialis]], invoked Ceres (and probably Tellus) along with twelve specialised, minor assistant-gods to secure divine help and protection at each stage of the grain cycle, beginning shortly before the Feriae Sementivae.&lt;ref&gt;Ceres' 12 assistant deities are listed in [[Servius]], ''On Vergil's Georgics'', 1.21. Cited in Spaeth, 1996, p. 36. Servius cites the historian [[Fabius Pictor]] (late 3rd century BC) as his source.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher|W.H. Roscher]] lists these deities among the ''[[indigitamenta]]'', names used to invoke specific divine functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher]], ''Ausführliches Lexikon der griechischen und römischen Mythologie'' (Leipzig: Teubner, 1890–94), vol. 2, pt. 1, pp. 187–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage, human fertility and nourishment===
In Roman bridal processions, a young boy carried Ceres' torch to light the way; "the most [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|auspicious wood]] for wedding torches came from the ''spina alba'', the [[Crataegus|may tree]], which bore many fruits and hence symbolised fertility".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, citing [[Pliny the Elder]], ''Historia Naturalis'', 30.75.&lt;/ref&gt; The adult males of the wedding party waited at the groom's house. A wedding sacrifice was offered to [[Terra Mater|Tellus]] on the bride's behalf; a sow is the most likely [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#victima|victim]]. Varro describes the sacrifice of a pig as "a worthy mark of weddings" because "our women, and especially nurses" call the female genitalia ''porcus'' (pig). [[Barbette Spaeth|Spaeth]] (1996) believes Ceres may have been included in the sacrificial dedication, because she is closely identified with Tellus and, as ''Ceres legifera'' (law-bearer), she "bears the laws" of marriage. In the most solemn form of marriage, ''confarreatio'', the bride and groom shared a cake made of far, the ancient wheat-type particularly associated with Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 5, 6, 44–47. ; the relevant passage from Varro is ''Rerum Rusticarum'', 2.4.10. [[Servius]], ''On Vergil's Aeneid'', 4.58, "implies that Ceres established the laws for weddings as well as for other aspects of civilized life." For more on Roman attitudes to marriage and sexuality, Ceres' role at marriages and the ideal of a "chaste married life" for Roman matrons, see Staples, 1998, pp. 84–93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benko, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ceres statue.jpg|thumb|Funerary statue of an unknown woman, depicted as Ceres holding wheat. Mid 3rd century AD. ([[Louvre]])]]
From at least the mid-republican era, an official, joint cult to Ceres and Proserpina reinforced Ceres' connection with Roman ideals of female virtue. The promotion of this cult coincides with the rise of a plebeian nobility, an increased birthrate among plebeian commoners, and a fall in the birthrate among patrician families. The late Republican ''Ceres Mater'' (Mother Ceres) is described as ''genetrix'' (progenitress) and ''alma'' (nourishing); in the early Imperial era she becomes an Imperial deity, and receives joint cult with [[Ops]] [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]], Ceres' own mother in Imperial guise and a bountiful genetrix in her own right.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, 103 - 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Ceres' ancient Italic precursors are connected to human fertility and motherhood; the Pelignan goddess ''[[Angitia]] Cerealis'' has been identified with the Roman goddess [[Angerona]] (associated with childbirth).&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 42–43, citing Vetter, E., 1953, ''Handbuch der italienischen Dialekte'' 1. Heidelberg, for connections between Ceres, Pelignan ''Angitia Cerealis'', ''Angerona'' and childbirth.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws===
Ceres was patron and protector of [[Plebeian Council|plebeian laws]], rights and [[Tribune]]s. Her Aventine Temple served the plebeians as cult centre, legal archive, treasury and possibly law-court; its foundation was contemporaneous with the passage of the [[Lex Sacrata]], which established the office and person of plebeian aediles and tribunes as inviolate representatives of the Roman people. Tribunes were legally immune to arrest or threat, and the lives and property of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacer|those who violated this law]] were forfeit to Ceres.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of the duties, legal status and immunities of plebeian tribunes and aediles, see Andrew Lintott, ''Violence in Republican Rome'', Oxford University Press, 1999,[https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKEpOP4lLIC&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;ots=6D9vv75Yun&amp;dq=servare%20de%20caelo&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q=Ceres&amp;f=false pp. 92–101]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lex Hortensia]] of 287 BC extended plebeian laws to the city and all its citizens. The official decrees of the Senate (''senatus consulta'') were placed in Ceres' Temple, under the guardianship of the goddess and her aediles. Livy puts the reason bluntly: the consuls could no longer seek advantage by arbitrarily tampering with the laws of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Livy's proposal that the ''senatus consulta'' were placed at the Aventine Temple more or less at its foundation (Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', 3.55.13) is implausible. See Spaeth, 1996, pp. 86–87, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The Temple might also have offered asylum for those threatened with arbitrary arrest by patrician magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for the temple as asylum is inconclusive; discussion is in Spaeth, 1996, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceres' temple, games and cult were at least part-funded by fines imposed on those who offended the laws placed under her protection; the poet Vergil later calls her ''legifera Ceres'' (Law-bearing Ceres), a translation of Demeter's Greek epithet, ''[[Thesmophoria|thesmophoros]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, T., ''The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c.1000–264 BC)'', Routledge, 1995, p. 264, citing vergil, Aeneid, 4.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Ceres' first plough-furrow opened the earth (Tellus' realm) to the world of men and created the first field and its boundary, her laws determined the course of settled, lawful, civilised life. Crimes against fields and harvest were crimes against the people and their protective deity. Landowners who allowed their flocks to graze on public land were fined by the plebeian aediles, on behalf of Ceres and the people of Rome. Ancient laws of the [[Twelve Tables]] forbade the magical charming of field crops from a neighbour's field into one's own, and invoked the death penalty for the illicit removal of field boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, in Valerie Flint, ''et al.'', ''Athlone History of Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 2, Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd., 1998, p. 83: citing Pliny, Natural History, 28.17–18; Seneca, Natural Questions, 4.7.2&lt;/ref&gt; An adult who damaged or stole field-crops should be hanged "for Ceres".&lt;ref&gt;Cereri necari, literally "killed for Ceres".&lt;/ref&gt; Any youth guilty of the same offense was to be whipped or fined double the value of damage.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, p. 70, citing Pliny the elder, Historia naturalis, 18.3.13 on the Twelve Tables and ''cereri necari''; cf the terms of punishment for violation of the sancrosancticity of Tribunes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The killing of the tribune Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC was justified by some as rightful punishment for attempted tyranny, an offense against Ceres' ''Lex sacrata''. Others deplored it as murder, because the same ''Lex sacrata'' made his person sacrosanct. In 70 BC, [[Cicero]] refers to this killing in connection with Ceres' laws and cults, during his prosecution of [[Verres]], Roman governor of Sicily, for extortion.&lt;ref&gt;David Stockton, ''Cicero: a political biography'', Oxford University Press, 1971, pp. 43–49. Cicero's published account of the case is usually known as ''In Verrem'', or ''Against Verres''.&lt;/ref&gt; The case included circumstantial details of Verres' irreligious exploitation and abuse of Sicilian grain farmers, who were naturally under Ceres' special protection at the very place of her "earthly home" &amp;ndash; and his thefts from her temple, including an ancient image of the goddess herself.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, Against Verres, Second pleading, 4.49–51:[[s:Against Verres/Second pleading/Book 4|English version available at wikisource.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Faced by the mounting evidence against him, Verres abandoned his own defense and withdrew to a prosperous exile. Soon after, Cicero won election as [[aedile]].

Ceres protected transitions of women from girlhood to womanhood, from unmarried to married life and motherhood. She also maintained the boundaries between the realms of the living and the dead, regardless of their sex. Given the appropriate rites, she helped the deceased into afterlife as an underworld shade ([[Di Manes]]), else their spirit might remain to haunt the living, as a wandering, [[vengeful ghost]] ([[Lemures|Lemur]]). For this service, well-off families offered Ceres sacrifice of a pig. The poor could offer wheat, flowers, and a libation.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 55–63. See also Viet Rosenberger, in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p 296, for sacrifice of a pig at funerals.&lt;/ref&gt; The expected afterlife for the exclusively female initiates in the ''sacra Cereris'' may have been somewhat different; they were offered "a method of living" and of "dying with better hope".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 60–61, 66; citing Cicero, ''de Legibus'', 2.36. As initiates of mystery religions were sworn to secrecy, very little is known of their central rites or beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''mundus'' of Ceres===
The ''mundus cerialis'' (literally "the world" of Ceres or ''Caereris mundus'') was a hemispherical pit or underground vault in Rome. Its location is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Candidates for location include the site of Rome's [[Comitium]] and the [[Palatine Hill]], within the city’s ritual boundary ([[pomerium]]).&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually sealed by a stone lid known as the ''[[lapis manalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Apparently not the same [[Lapis manalis]] used by the pontifices to alleviate droughts.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, October 5 and November 8, it was opened with the official announcement "''mundus patet''" ("the ''mundus'' is open"), and offerings were made there to agricultural or underworld deities, including Ceres as goddess of the fruitful earth and guardian of its underworld portals. Its opening offered the spirits of the dead temporary leave from the underworld, to roam lawfully among the living, in what Warde Fowler describes as ‘holidays, so to speak, for the ghosts’.&lt;ref&gt;W. Warde Fowler, "Mundus Patet" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 2, 1912, pp. 25–26: Warde Fowler notes the possibility that pigs were offered: also (pp. 35–36) seed-corn, probably ''far'', from the harvest.&lt;/ref&gt; The days when the mundus was open were among the very few occasions that Romans made official contact with the collective spirits of the dead, the ''Di Manes'' (the others being [[Parentalia]] and [[Lemuralia]]). This secondary or late function of the ''mundus'' is attested no earlier than the Late Republican Era, by [[Varro]].&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Macrobius, 1.16.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The jurist [[Marcus Porcius Cato Licinianus|Cato]] understood the mundus' shape as a reflection or inversion of the dome of the upper heavens.&lt;ref&gt;Festus p. 261 L2, citing's Cato's commentaries on civil law.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman tradition held that the ''mundus'' had been dug and sealed by [[Romulus]] as part of Rome's foundation; Plutarch compares it to pits dug by Etruscan colonists, containing soil brought from their parent city, used to dedicate the first fruits of the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Romulus'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Warde Fowler speculates the ''mundus'' as Rome's first storehouse (''penus'') for seed-grain, later becoming the symbolic ''penus'' of the Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;See Spaeth, pp. 63–5: W. Warde Fowler, "Mundus Patet" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 2, (1912), pp. 25–33: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/JRS/2/Mundus*.html available online at Bill Thayer's website]: M. Humm, "Le mundus et le Comitium : représentations symboliques de l’espace de la cité," Histoire urbaine, 2, 10, 2004. [http://www.cairn.info/revue-histoire-urbaine-2004-2-page-43.htm French language, full preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest known Roman calendar, the days of the ''mundus'' are marked as C(omitiales) (days when the [[Comitia]] met). Later authors mark them as ''dies [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#religiosus|religiosus]]'' (when no official meetings could be held). Some modern scholars seek to explain this as the later introduction and accommodation of Greek elements, grafted onto the original ''mundus'' rites.&lt;ref&gt;M. Humm, "Le mundus et le Comitium : représentations symboliques de l’espace de la cité," Histoire urbaine, 2, 10, 2004. [http://www.cairn.info/revue-histoire-urbaine-2004-2-page-43.htm French language, full preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; The rites of August 24 were held between the agricultural festivals of [[Consualia]] and [[Opiconsivia]]; those of October 5 followed the ''[[Ieiunium Cereris]]'', and those of November 8 took place during the [[Ludi Plebeii|Plebeian Games]] As a whole, the various days of the ''mundus'' suggest rites to Ceres as the guardian deity of seed-corn in the establishment of cities, and in her function as a door-warden of the afterlife, which was co-ruled during the winter months by her daughter Proserpina, queen-companion to [[Dis Pater|Dis]].&lt;ref&gt;In Festus, the ''mundus'' is an entrance to the underworld realm of [[Orcus]], broadly equivalent to Dis Pater and Greek [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]]. For more on Ceres as a [[liminal deity]], her earthly precedence over the underworld and the ''mundus'', see Spaeth, 1996, pp. 5, 18, 31, 63-5.

Warde Fowler, "Mundus Patet" in ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 2, (1912), pp. 25–33: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/journals/JRS/2/Mundus*.html available online at Bill Thayer's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expiations===
In Roman theology, [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#prodigium|prodigies]] were abnormal phenomena that manifested [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ira deorum|divine anger]] at human impiety. In Roman histories, prodigies cluster around perceived or actual threats to the Roman state, in particular, famine, war and social disorder, and are expiated as matters of urgency. The establishment of Ceres' Aventine cult has itself been interpreted as an extraordinary expiation after the failure of crops and consequent famine. In Livy's history, Ceres is among the deities placated after a remarkable series of prodigies that accompanied the disasters of the [[Second Punic War]]: during the same conflict, a lightning strike at her temple was expiated. A fast in her honour is recorded for 191 BC, to be repeated at 5-year intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]], 36.37.4-5. Livy describes the fast as a cyclical ''ieiunium Cereris''; but see also Viet Rosenberger, in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p 296; if expiatory, it may have been a once-only event.&lt;/ref&gt; After 206, she was offered at least 11 further official expiations. Many of these were connected to famine and manifestations of plebeian unrest, rather than war. From the Middle Republic onwards, expiation was increasingly addressed to her as mother to Proserpina. The last known followed [[Great Fire of Rome|Rome's Great Fire of 64 AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 14–15, 65–7(?).&lt;/ref&gt; The cause or causes of the fire remained uncertain, but its disastrous extent was taken as a sign of offense against [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], and Ceres-with-Proserpina, who were all were given expiatory cult. Champlin (2003) perceives the expiations to Vulcan and Ceres in particular as attempted populist appeals by the ruling emperor, [[Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;For the circumstances of this expiation, and debate over the site of the Cerean expiation, see Edward Champlin, ''Nero'', Harvard University Press, 2003, pp. 191–4: this expiation is usually said to be at the Aventine Temple. Champlin prefers the mundus (at or very near the [[Comitia]]).

==Myths and theology==
[[File:Ceres - Dominikus Auliczek um 1770-1.jpg|thumb|Porcelain model of Ceres with cereals by [[Dominik Auliczek]] of the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]], late 18th century ]]
The complex and multi-layered origins of the Aventine Triad and Ceres herself allowed multiple interpretations of their relationships; Cicero asserts Ceres as mother to both Liber and Libera, consistent with her role as a mothering deity. Varro's more complex theology groups her functionally with Tellus, Terra, Venus (and thus Victoria) and with Libera as a female aspect of Liber.&lt;ref&gt;C.M.C. Green, "Varro's Three Theologies and their influence on the Fasti", in Geraldine Herbert-Brown, (ed)., ''Ovid's Fasti: historical readings at its bimillennium'', Oxford University Press, 2002. pp. 78–80.[https://books.google.com/books?id=CeFErNPdXOMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=jKfOltwDm_&amp;dq=Ovid's%20Fasti%3A%20historical%20readings%20at%20its%20bimillennium%20%20By%20Geraldine%20Herbert-Brown&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; No native Roman myths of Ceres are known. According to ''[[Interpretatio graeca#Roman version|interpretatio romana]]'', by which Roman deities were identified with their Greek counterparts, she was an equivalent to Demeter, one of the [[Twelve Olympians]] of Greek religion and mythology; this made Ceres one of Rome's twelve [[Di Consentes]], daughter of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and [[Ops]], sister of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], mother of [[Proserpina]] by Jupiter and sister of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] and [[Dis Pater|Dis]]. Ceres' known mythology is indistinguishable from Demeter's:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"When Ceres sought through all the earth with lit torches for Proserpina, who had been seized by Dis Pater, she called her with shouts where three or four roads meet; from this it has endured in her rites that on certain days a lamentation is raised at the crossroads everywhere by the ''matronae''."&lt;ref&gt;Servius on [[Vergil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'', 4.609. Cited in Spaeth, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ovid]] likens Ceres' devotion to her own offspring to that of a cow to its calf; but she is also as the originator of bloody animal sacrifice, a necessity in the renewal of life. She has a particular enmity towards her own sacrificial animal, the pig. Pigs offend her by their destructive rooting-up of field crops under her protection; and in the myth of Proserpina's abduction on the plains of [[Enna|Henna]] (Enna), her tracks were obscured by their trampling. If not for them, Ceres might have been spared the toils and grief of her lengthy search and separation.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Feeney, "Sacrificial Ritual in Roman Poetry", in Barchiesi, Rüpke, Stephens, ''Rituals in Ink: A Conference on Religion and Literary Production in Ancient Rome Held at Stanford University in February 2002'', Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004, pp. 14, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Enna, in [[Sicily]], had strong mythological connections with Ceres and Proserpina, and was the site of Ceres most ancient sanctuary. Flowers were said to bloom throughout the year on its "miraculous plain".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
[[Vitruvius]] (c.80 – 15 BC) describes the "Temple of Ceres near the Circus Maximus" (her Aventine Temple) as typically [[Araeostyle]], having widely spaced supporting columns, with [[architrave]]s of wood, rather than stone. This species of temple is "clumsy, heavy roofed, low and wide, [its] [[pediment]]s ornamented with statues of clay or brass, gilt in the [[Etruscan civilization#Architecture|Tuscan fashion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, On Architecture, 3.1.5 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/3*.html#1.5 available at penelope. edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He recommends that temples to Ceres be sited in rural areas: "in a solitary spot out of the city, to which the public are not necessarily led but for the purpose of sacrificing to her. This spot is to be reverenced with religious awe and solemnity of demeanour, by those whose affairs lead them to visit it."&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius, On Architecture, 1.7.2 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#7.2 available at penelope. edu]&lt;/ref&gt; During the early Imperial era, soothsayers advised [[Pliny the Younger]] to restore an ancient, "old and narrow" temple to Ceres, at his rural property near [[Como]]. It contained an ancient wooden cult statue of the goddess, which he replaced. Though this was unofficial, private cult (''sacra privata'') its annual feast on the [[Roman calendar#Months|Ides]] of September, the same day as the [[Epulum Jovis]], was attended by pilgrims from all over the region. Pliny considered this rebuilding a fulfillment of his civic and religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, ''Epistles'', 9.39: cited by Oliver de Cazanove, in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Images of Ceres===
[[File:Denarius C. Memmius C. F. Romulus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Denarius]] picturing [[Quirinus]] on the [[obverse]], and Ceres enthroned on the reverse, a commemoration by a moneyer in 56 BC of a Cerialia, perhaps her first ''[[ludi]]'', presented by an earlier [[Memmia (gens)|Gaius Memmius]] as [[aedile]]&lt;ref&gt;Eric Orlin, ''Foreign Cults in Rome: Creating a Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

No images of Ceres survive from her pre-Aventine cults; the earliest date to the middle Republic, and show the Hellenising influence of Demeter's iconography. Some late Republican images recall Ceres' search for Proserpina. Ceres bears a torch, sometimes two, and rides in a chariot drawn by snakes; or she sits on the sacred ''kiste'' (chest) that conceals the objects of her mystery rites.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, pp. 11, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes she holds a [[caduceus]], a symbol of [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]] (Roman goddess of Peace).&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, pp. 28, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustan reliefs show her emergence, plant-like from the earth, her arms entwined by snakes, her outstretched hands bearing poppies and wheat, or her head crowned with fruits and vines.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, p. 37, illustrated at fig. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In free-standing statuary, she commonly wears a wheat-crown, or holds a wheat spray. [[Moneyer|Moneyers of the Republican era]] use Ceres' image, wheat ears and garlands to advertise their connections with prosperity, the annona and the popular interest. Some Imperial coin images depict important female members of the Imperial family as Ceres, or with some of her attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, pp. 97–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Priesthoods==
[[File:Склеп Деметры.JPG|thumb|A Greek [[fresco]] depicting the goddess [[Demeter]], from [[Panticapaeum]] in the ancient [[Bosporan Kingdom]] (a [[client state]] of the [[Roman Empire]]), 1st century AD, [[Crimea]].]]
Ceres was served by several public priesthoods. Some were male; her senior priest, the ''flamen cerialis'', also served Tellus and was usually plebeian by ancestry or adoption.&lt;ref&gt;Rome's legendary second King, [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] was thought to have instituted the flamines, so Ceres' service by a ''flamen cerialis'' suggested her oldest Roman cult as one of great antiquity.&lt;/ref&gt; Her public cult at the [[Ambarvalia]], or "perambulation of fields" identified her with [[Dea Dia]], and was led by the [[Arval Brethren]] ("The Brothers of the Fields"); rural versions of these rites were led as private cult by the [[Pater familias|heads of households]]. An inscription at [[Capua]] names a male ''sacerdos Cerialis mundalis'', a priest dedicated to Ceres' rites of the ''mundus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]] X 3926.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aedile|plebeian aediles]] had minor or occasional priestly functions at Ceres' Aventine Temple and were responsible for its management and financial affairs including collection of fines, the organisation of ''ludi Cerealia'' and probably the Cerealia itself. Their ''cure'' (care and jurisdiction) included, or came to include, the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome#Grain supply made an official responsibility|grain supply]] (''annona'') and later the plebeian grain doles (''frumentationes''), the organisation and management of public [[Ludi|games]] in general, and the maintenance of Rome's streets and public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Responsibility for the provision of grain and popular games lent the aedileship a high and politically useful public profile. See [[Cursus honorum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, in Rome and throughout Italy, as at her ancient sanctuaries of Henna and Catena, Ceres' ''[[ritus graecus]]'' and her joint cult with Proserpina were invariably led by female ''sacerdotes'', drawn from local and Roman elites: Cicero notes that once the new cult had been founded, its earliest priestesses "generally were either from Naples or Velia", cities allied or federated to Rome. Elsewhere, he describes Ceres' Sicilian priestesses as "older women respected for their noble birth and character".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 104-5, citing Cicero, ''Pro Balbus'', 55, and Cicero, ''Contra Verres'', 2.4.99. The translations are Spaeth's.&lt;/ref&gt; Celibacy may have been a condition of their office; sexual abstinence was, according to Ovid, required of those attending Ceres' major, nine-day festival.&lt;ref&gt;Most modern scholarship assumes Cerean priestesses celibate during their term of office but the evidence is inconclusive. See Schultz, 2006, pp. 75–78, for full discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Her public priesthood was reserved to respectable matrons, be they married, divorced or widowed.&lt;ref&gt;See Schultz, pp. 75–78: also Schultz, Celia E., Harvey, Paul, (Eds), ''Religion in Republican Italy'', Yale Classical Studies, 2006, pp. 52–53: [https://books.google.com/books?id=paoDK0afIcIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=knQm_fNTYy&amp;dq=Religion%20in%20republican%20Italy%20%20By%20Paul%20B.%20Harvey%2C%20Celia%20E.%20Schultz&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q=Ceres&amp;f=false googlebooks preview]&lt;/ref&gt; The process of their selection and their relationship to Ceres' older, entirely male priesthood is unknown; but they far outnumbered her few male priests, and would have been highly respected and influential figures in their own communities.&lt;ref&gt;A Roman matron was any mature woman, married or unmarried, usually but not exclusively of the upper class. While females could serve as [[Vestal Virgins]], few were chosen, and those were selected as young maidens from families of the upper class.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 4–5, 9, 20 (historical overview and Aventine priesthoods), 84–89 (functions of plebeian aediles), 104–106 (women as priestesses): citing among others Cicero, ''In Verres'', 2.4.108; Valerius Maximus, 1.1.1; Plutarch, ''De Mulierum Virtutibus'', 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More epigraphic evidence survives for priestesses of Ceres than for any other priesthood; it shows Cerean cults as less exclusively female than contemporary Roman authors would have it; while most Cerean priestesses were assisted by females, two in the Italian province are known to have had male assistants (''Magistri Cereris''). See Schultz, p. 72 and footnote 90 (p. 177).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult development==

===Archaic and Regal eras===
Roman tradition credited Ceres' eponymous festival, [[Cerealia]], to Rome's second king, the semi-legendary [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]]. Ceres' senior, male priesthood was a [[Flamen|minor flaminate]] whose priesthood and rites were supposedly also innovations of Numa.&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not Numa existed, the antiquity of Ceres' Italic cult is attested by the threefold inscription of her name c.600 BC on a Faliscan jar; the Faliscans were close neighbours of Rome. See Spaeth, 1996, pp. 4, 5, 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Her affinity and joint cult with Tellus, also known as [[Terra Mater]] (Mother Earth) may have developed at this time. Much later, during the [[Principate|early Imperial era]], [[Ovid]] describes these goddesses as "partners in labour"; Ceres provides the "cause" for the growth of crops, while Tellus provides them a place to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', 1.673–684.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican era===

====Ceres and the Aventine Triad====
In 496 BC, against a background of economic recession and famine in Rome, imminent war against the Latins and a threatened secession by Rome's [[plebs]] (citizen commoners), the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis|A. Postumius]] [[Votum|vowed]] a temple to Ceres, [[Liber]] and [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]] on or near the [[Aventine Hill]]. The famine ended and Rome's plebeian citizen-soldiery co-operated in the conquest of the Latins. Postumius' vow was fulfilled in 493 BC: Ceres became the central deity of the new [[Triple deity#List of triple deities|Triad]], housed in a [[Aventine Triad|new-built Aventine temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp.[https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;vq=lavinium&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 8], [https://books.google.com/books?id=5g3YDlPvbeMC&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;vq=Liber%20Cicero&amp;dq=%20Spaeth%2C%20Barbette%20S.%2C%20&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 44.]&lt;/ref&gt; She was also &amp;ndash; or became &amp;ndash; the patron goddess of the ''[[plebs]]'', whose enterprise as tenant farmers, estate managers, agricultural factors and importers was a mainstay of Roman agriculture.

Much of Rome's grain was imported from territories of [[Magna Graecia]], particularly from [[Sicily]], which later Roman [[mythographer]]s describe as Ceres' "earthly home". Writers of the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147–30 BC)|late Roman Republic]] and early Empire describe Ceres' Aventine temple and rites as conspicuously Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Wiseman, 1995, p. 133 and notes 20, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern scholarship, this is taken as further evidence of long-standing connections between the plebeians, Ceres and Magna Graecia. It also raises unanswered questions on the nature, history and character of these associations: the Triad itself may have been a self-consciously Roman cult formulation based on Greco-Italic precedents.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Sibylline Books]] were written in Greek; according to later historians, they had recommended the inauguration of Roman cult to the Greek deities [[Demeter]], [[Dionysus]] and [[Persephone]]. See also Cornell, T., ''The beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c.1000–264 BC)'', Routledge, 1995, p. 264, for Greek models as a likely basis in the development of plebeian political and religious identity from an early date.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate matters further, when a new form of Cerean cult was officially imported from Magna Graecia, it was known as the ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ritus graecus|ritus graecus]]'' (Greek rite) of Ceres, and was distinct from her older Roman rites.&lt;ref name="Spaeth 1996, pp. 4, 6"&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 4, 6–13. For discussion of ''ritus graecus'' and its relation to Ceres' cult, see Scheid, pp. 15–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The older forms of Aventine rites to Ceres remain uncertain. Most Roman cults were led by men, and the officiant's head was [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#capite velato|covered]] by a fold of his toga. In the Roman ''ritus graecus'', a male celebrant wore Greek-style vestments, and remained bareheaded before the deity, or else wore a wreath. While Ceres' original Aventine cult was led by male priests, her "Greek rites" (''ritus graecus Cereris'') were exclusively female.&lt;ref name="Spaeth 1996, pp. 4, 6"/&gt;

===Middle Republic===
[[File:20120929 Chicago Board of Trade Building top recrop.jpg|thumb|upright|A 3-storey faceless depiction of Ceres rests atop the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]].]]

====Ceres and Proserpina====
Towards the end of the [[Second Punic War]], around 205 BC, an officially recognised joint cult to Ceres and her daughter [[Proserpina]] was brought to Rome from southern Italy (part of [[Magna Graecia]]) along with Greek priestesses to serve it.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 4, 6–13, citing [[Arnobius]], who mistakes this as the first Roman cult to Ceres. His belief may reflect its high profile and ubiquity during the later Imperial period, and possibly the fading of older, distinctively Aventine forms of her cult.&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome, this was known as the ''ritus graecus Cereris''; its priestesses were granted [[Roman citizenship]] so that they could pray to the gods "with a foreign and external knowledge, but with a domestic and civil intention". The cult was based on ancient, ethnically Greek cults to Demeter, most notably the [[Thesmophoria]] to [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]], whose cults and myths also provided a basis for the [[Eleusinian mysteries]].

From the end of the 3rd century BC, Demeter's temple at [[Enna]], in [[Sicily]], was acknowledged as Ceres' oldest, most authoritative cult centre, and Libera was recognised as Proserpina, Roman equivalent to Demeter's daughter [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheid, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Their joint cult recalls Demeter's search for Persephone, after the latter's rape and abduction into the underworld by [[Hades]]. The new cult to "mother and maiden" took its place alongside the old, but made no reference to Liber. Thereafter, Ceres was offered two separate and distinctive forms of official cult at the Aventine. Both might have been supervised by the male [[Flamen#Flamines minores|flamen Cerialis]] but otherwise, their relationship is unclear. The older form of cult included both men and women, and probably remained a focus for plebeian political identity and discontent. The new identified its exclusively females initiates and priestesses as upholders of Rome's traditional, [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]]-dominated social hierarchy and [[mos maiorum|morality]].&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 13, 15, 60, 94–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ceres and Magna Mater====
A year after the import of the ''ritus cereris'', patrician senators imported cult to the Greek goddess [[Cybele]] and established her as [[Magna Mater]] (The Great Mother) within Rome's [[Pomerium|sacred boundary]], facing the Aventine Hill. Like Ceres, Cybele was a form of Graeco-Roman earth goddess. Unlike her, she had mythological ties to [[Troy]], and thus to the Trojan prince [[Aeneas]], mythological ancestor of [[Founding of Rome|Rome's founding father]] and first patrician [[Romulus]]. The establishment of official Roman cult to Magna Mater coincided with the start of a new ''saeculum'' (cycle of years). It was followed by Hannibal's defeat, the end of the Punic War and an exceptionally good harvest. Roman victory and recovery could therefore be credited to Magna Mater and patrician piety: so the patricians dined her and each other at her festival banquets. In similar fashion, the plebeian nobility underlined their claims to Ceres. Up to a point, the two cults reflected a social and political divide, but when certain prodigies were interpreted as evidence of Ceres' displeasure, the senate appeased her with a new festival, the ''ieiunium Cereris'' ("[[fasting|fast]] of Ceres").&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 14, 94–97. See also the legend of [[Claudia Quinta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 133 BC, the [[Nobiles|plebeian noble]] [[Tiberius Gracchus]] bypassed the [[Roman senate|Senate]] and appealed directly to the popular assembly to pass his proposed [[agrarian law|land-reforms]]. Civil unrest spilled into violence; Gracchus and many of his supporters were murdered by their conservative opponents. At the behest of the [[Sibylline Books|Sibylline oracle]], the senate sent the [[Quindecimviri sacris faciundis|quindecimviri]] to Ceres' ancient cult centre at [[Enna|Henna]] in [[Sicily]], the goddess' supposed place of origin and earthly home. Some kind of religious consultation or propitiation was given, either to expiate Gracchus' murder &amp;ndash; as later Roman sources would claim &amp;ndash; or to justify it as the lawful killing of a would-be king or [[Demagogy|demagogue]], a ''[[homo sacer]]'' who had offended Ceres' laws against tyranny.&lt;ref&gt;Both interpretations are possible. On the whole, Roman sources infer the expedition as expiatory; for background, see Valerius Maximus, 1.1.1., and Cicero, ''In Verres'', 2.4.108 ''et passim'', cited by Olivier de Cazanove, in Rüpke, Jörg (Editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, p 56. For debate and challenge to Roman descriptions of the motives for this expedition, see Spaeth, 1990, pp. 182–195. Spaeth finds the expedition an attempt to justify the killing of T. Gracchus as official, right and lawful, based on senatorial speeches given soon after the killing; ''contra'' Henri Le Bonniec, ''Le culte de Cérès à Rome. Des origines à la fin de la République'', Paris, Librairie C. Klincksieck, 1958. Le Bonniec interprets the consultation as an attempt to compensate the plebs and their patron goddess for the murder.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Republic===
The Eleusinian mysteries became increasingly popular during the late Republic. Early Roman initiates at [[Eleusis]] in Greece included [[Sulla]] and [[Cicero]]; thereafter many [[Roman emperor|Emperors]] were initiated, including [[Hadrian]], who founded an Eleusinian cult centre in Rome itself.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 13, citing Cicero, Balbus, 55.5., and p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Late Republican politics, [[Optimates|aristocratic traditionalists]] and [[Populares|popularists]] used coinage to propagate their competing claims to Ceres' favour. A coin of [[Sulla]] shows Ceres on one side, and on the other a ploughman with yoked oxen: the images, accompanied by the legend ''"conditor"'', claim his rule (a military dictatorship) as regenerative and divinely justified.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, J. Rufus, ''The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology'', in Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase (eds), Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt, Part 2, Volume 17, p. 795.[https://books.google.com/books?id=QK1M2VD1tsAC&amp;lpg=PA795&amp;vq=Sulla%20conditor&amp;dq=The%20Cult%20of%20Virtues%20and%20Roman%20Imperial%20Ideology%2C&amp;pg=PA795#v=snippet&amp;q=Sulla%20conditor&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Popularists used her name and attributes to appeal their guardianship of plebeian interests, particularly the ''annona'' and ''frumentarium''; and plebeian nobles and aediles used them to point out their ancestral connections with plebeians as commoners.&lt;ref&gt;The plebeian L. Assius Caeicianus, identifies his plebeian ancestry and duties to Ceres on a denarius issue, c.102 BC. Spaeth, 1996, pp. 97–100.&lt;/ref&gt; In the decades of Civil War that ushered in the Empire, such images and dedications proliferate on Rome's coinage: [[Julius Caesar]], his opponents, his assassins and his heirs alike claimed the favour and support of Ceres and her plebeian proteges, with coin issues that celebrate Ceres, ''[[Libertas]]'' (liberty) and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] (victory).&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 97–100, with further coin images between pp. 32–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial era===
[[File:Nero Lugdunum sestertius 691535.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Emperors celebrated imperial and divine partnerships in grain import and provision. On this [[sestertius]] of 66 AD, [[Nero]]'s garlanded head is left.

Between them on a garlanded altar, a [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Dry measures|modius]] (grain measure), and in the background, a ship's stern.]]
Imperial theology conscripted Rome's traditional cults as the divine upholders of Imperial [[Pax (mythology)|Pax]] (peace) and prosperity, for the benefit of all. The emperor [[Augustus]] began the restoration of Ceres' Aventine Temple; his successor [[Tiberius]] completed it.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 6–8, 86ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the several figures on the Augustan [[Ara Pacis]], one doubles as a portrait of the Empress [[Livia]], who wears Ceres' ''corona spicea''. Another has been variously identified in modern scholarship as Tellus, Venus, Pax or Ceres, or in Spaeth's analysis, a deliberately broad composite of them all.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth argues for the identification of the central figure in the Ara Pacis relief as Ceres. It is more usually interpreted as Tellus. See Spaeth, 1996, 127–134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emperor [[Claudius]]' reformed the grain supply and created its embodiment as an Imperial goddess, [[Annona (goddess)|Annona]], a junior partner to Ceres and the Imperial family. The traditional, Cerean virtues of provision and nourishment were symbolically extended to Imperial family members; some coinage shows Claudius' mother [[Antonia Minor|Antonia]] as an [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusta]], wearing the ''corona spicea''.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 26, 30. See also Fears, J. Rufus, ''The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology'', in Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase (eds), Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt, Part 2, Volume 17, pp. 894–5.[https://books.google.com/books?id=QK1M2VD1tsAC&amp;pg=PA827&amp;lpg=PA827&amp;dq=The+Cult+of+Virtues+and+Roman+Imperial+Ideology,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dMROFqIUgG&amp;sig=d5gFwDI669qFv-6EWbfZuJJESHI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=12KOTa6mKdGDhQeMmuS7Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Cult%20of%20Virtues%20and%20Roman%20Imperial%20Ideology%2C&amp;f=false]: Ceres Augusta can be considered, along with Pax, Libertas ''et al.'', as one of several Imperial Virtues.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between the reigning emperor, empress and Ceres was formalised in titles such as [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]] mater agrorum&lt;ref&gt;[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]Xl, 3196.&lt;/ref&gt; ("The august mother of the fields) and ''Ceres Augusta''. On coinage, various emperors and empresses wear her ''corona spicea'', showing that the goddess, the emperor and his spouse are conjointly responsible for agricultural prosperity and the all-important provision of grain. A coin of [[Nerva]] (reigned AD 96–98) acknowledges Rome's dependence on the princeps' gift of ''frumentio'' (corn dole) to the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Nerva's later dynastic successor [[Antoninus Pius]], Imperial theology represents the death and [[apotheosis]] of the Empress [[Faustina the Elder]] as Ceres' return to Olympus by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter's]] command. Even then, "her care for mankind continues and the world can rejoice in the warmth of her daughter Proserpina: in Imperial flesh, Proserpina is [[Faustina the Younger]]", empress-wife of Pius' successor [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Fears, J. Rufus, ''The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology'', in Hildegard Temporini, Wolfgang Haase (eds), Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt, Part 2, Volume 17, Walter de Gruyter, 1981, pp. 905–5, footnote 372 1, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, a soldier's inscription of the 2nd century AD attests to Ceres' role in the popular syncretism of the times. She is "the bearer of ears of corn", the "Syrian Goddess", identical with the universal heavenly Mother, the Magna Mater and [[Virgo (constellation)#Mythology|Virgo]], virgin mother of the gods. She is peace and virtue, and inventor of justice: she weighs "Life and Right" in her scale.&lt;ref&gt;Benko, pp. 112–114: see also pp. 31, 51, citing Apuleius, Metamorphoses, 11.2, in which Isis reveals to Lucius that she, Ceres and Proserpina, Artemis and Venus are all aspects of the one "Heavenly Queen"; cf [[Juno (mythology)#Epithets|Juno Caelestis]], "Queen of Heaven", the Romanised form of [[Tanit]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Late Imperial era, Ceres gradually "slips into obscurity"; the last known official association of the Imperial family with her symbols is a coin issue of [[Septimius Severus]] (AD 193–211), showing his empress, [[Julia Domna]], in the ''corona spicea''. After the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus]], no coinage shows Ceres' image. Even so, an initiate of her mysteries is attested in the 5th century AD, after the official abolition of all non-Christian cults.&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth, 1996, pp. 30, 62, citing EE 4.866 for the 5th century ''mystes Cereris''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[cereal]]s derives from Ceres, commemorating her association with edible grains. Statues of Ceres top the domes of the [[Missouri State Capitol]] and the [[Vermont State House]] serving as a reminder of the importance of agriculture in the states' economies and histories. There is also a statue of her on top of the [[Chicago Board of Trade Building]], which conducts trading in agricultural commodities.

The [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] (discovered 1801), is named after this goddess. And in turn, the chemical element [[cerium]] (discovered 1803) was named after the dwarf planet. A poem about Ceres and humanity features in [[Dmitri]]'s confession to his brother Alexei in Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', Part 1, Book 3, Chapter 3.

Ceres appears as a character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]'' (1611).

An aria in praise of Ceres is sung in Act 4 of the opera ''The Trojans'' by [[Hector Berlioz]].

The 1937-1940 French 50 Francs bank note depicts Ceres in the Garden of Versailles.

The goddess Ceres is one of the three goddess offices held in [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry]]. The other goddesses are [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]], and [[Flora (deity)|Flora]].

Ceres is depicted on the [[Seal of New Jersey]] as a symbol of prosperity.

Ceres was depicted on several ten and twenty [[Confederate States of America dollar]] notes.

[[Yuu Watase]]'s [[manga]] is titled ''[[Ayashi no Ceres]]''.

A statue of Ceres stands at the top of the dome of the [[Missouri State Capitol]] in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]].

'''Christian Andreas Doppler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɒ|p|l|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈdɔplɐ|lang}}; 29 November 1803 – 17 March 1853)&lt;ref name=whonamedit/&gt; was an Austrian [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]]. He is celebrated for his principle — known as the [[Doppler effect]] — that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer. He used this concept to explain the color of [[binary star]]s.

==Biography==
Christian Doppler was born in [[Salzburg]] (today Austria) in 1803. After completing high school, Doppler studied philosophy in Salzburg and mathematics and physics at the Imperial–Royal Polytechnic Institute (now [[TU Wien]]), where he became an assistant in 1829. In 1835 he began work at the Prague Polytechnic (now [[Czech Technical University in Prague]]), where he received an appointment in 1841.

[[File:Doppler's Birth House.jpg|thumb|right|Doppler's birth house in [[Salzburg]], just next door to where [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] family had lived. A Doppler research-and memorial society is now housed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-salzburg.net/sights/christiandoppler.htm|title=Visit Salzburg - Christian Doppler birthplace|website=www.visit-salzburg.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Christan Doppler österreichischer Physiker.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on the house in [[Prague]] in which Doppler lived from 1843 to 1847]]

One year later, at the age of 38, Doppler gave a lecture to the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences and subsequently published his most notable work, "[[Über das farbige Licht der Doppelsterne und einiger anderer Gestirne des Himmels]]" ''(On the coloured light of the binary stars and some other stars of the heavens)''. There is a facsimile edition with an English translation by Alec Eden.&lt;ref name="AlecEden"&gt;{{Cite book

| title=The search for Christian Doppler

| isbn=0-387-82367-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Doppler postulated his principle (later coined the [[Doppler effect]]) that the observed frequency of a wave depends on the relative speed of the source and the observer, and he later tried to use this concept for explaining the colour of binary stars.

This was independently at the same time when [[physicist]] Armand [[Hippolyte Fizeau|Hippolyte Louis Fizeau]] ({{daterangedash|23 September 1819|18 September 1896|dmy}}) became also involved in aspects of the discovery of the [[Doppler effect]],&lt;ref name="Houda1991"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is known by the French as the ''Doppler-Fizeau Effect''. Fizeau contributed towards understanding its effect with light rather than sound, and in doing so, corrected many of Doppler's persistent errors. He also developed the formal mathematical theorem underlying the principles of this effect. In 1848, he discovered the frequency shift of a wave when the source and receiver are moving relative to each other,&lt;ref name="Houda1991" /&gt; therefore being the first to predict blue shifts and red shifts of light waves.&lt;ref name="Tobin2014"&gt;{{cite book

Doppler continued working  as a professor at the Prague Polytechnic, publishing over 50 articles on mathematics, physics and astronomy, but in 1847 he left Prague for the professorship of mathematics, physics, and mechanics at the Academy of Mines and Forests (its successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]) in [[Selmecbánya]] (then [[Kingdom of Hungary]], now Banská Štiavnica, [[Slovakia]]),

Doppler's research was interrupted by the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary incidents]] of 1848. During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian Revolution]], he fled to [[Vienna]]. There he was appointed head of the Institute for Experimental Physics at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1850. While there, Doppler, along with [[Franz Unger]], influenced the development of young [[Gregor Mendel]], the founding father of [[genetics]], who was a student at the University of Vienna from 1851 to 1853.&lt;ref name="Mathofinheritance"&gt;{{cite web

Doppler died on 17 March 1853 at age 49 from a [[pulmonary disease]] in [[Venice]] (at that time part of the Austrian Empire). His tomb, found by Dr. Peter M. Schuster&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, Peter M.

==Full name==
Some confusion exists about Doppler's full name. Doppler referred to himself as Christian Doppler. The records of his birth and baptism stated Christian ''Andreas'' Doppler. Forty years after Doppler's death the misnomer ''Johann'' Christian Doppler was introduced by the astronomer [[Julius Scheiner]]. Scheiner's mistake has since been copied by many.&lt;ref name="AlecEden" /&gt;

'''Closed ecological systems''' ('''CES''') are [[ecosystems]] that do not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system.

The term is most often used to describe small [[wikt:manmade|manmade]] ecosystems. Such systems are scientifically interesting and can potentially serve as a [[life support system]] during [[space flight]]s, in [[space stations]] or [[space habitat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Manmade Closed Ecological Systems | author= I. I. Gitelson | author2= G. M. Lisovsky | author3= R. D. MacElroy | last-author-amp= yes | publisher= [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |date=2003 | ISBN = 0-415-29998-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a closed ecological system, any waste products produced by one species must be used by at least one other species. If the purpose is to maintain a life form, such as a [[mouse]] or a [[human]], waste products such as [[carbon dioxide]], [[feces]] and [[urine]] must eventually be converted into [[oxygen]], [[food]], and [[water]].

A closed ecological system must contain at least one [[autotroph]]ic organism. While both [[chemotroph]]ic and [[phototroph]]ic organisms are plausible, almost all closed ecological systems to date are based on a phototroph such as green [[algae]].

== Examples ==

A closed ecological system for an entire planet is called an [[Ecosphere (planetary)|ecosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cof.orst.edu/cof/fs/turner/pdfs/lexicon_of_the_spheres.pdf|title=A Lexicon of the Spheres|publisher=[[Oregon State University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencehelpdesk.com/unit/science2/11|title=ESO 2 Science 11: The Ecosphere and the Ecosystems|publisher=Science Helpdesk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artificiality|Man-made]] closed ecological systems which were created to sustain human life include [[Biosphere 2]], [[MELiSSA]], and the BIOS-1, BIOS-2, and [[BIOS-3]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=BioScience | date=Oct 1997 | volume=47 |issue=9 | pages=575–85 | title= Bios-3: Siberian experiments in bioregenerative life support | author=Salisbury FB | author2=Gitelson JI | author3=Lisovsky GM | doi=10.2307/1313164 | pmid=11540303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bottle garden]]s and [[Ecosphere (aquarium)|aquarium ecospheres]] are partially or fully enclosed glass containers that are self-sustaining closed ecosystems that can be made or purchased. They can include tiny [[shrimp]], [[algae]], [[gravel]], decorative [[Animal shell|shell]]s, and [[gorgonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecospheres.co.uk/what-is-an-ecosphere/  | title=What is an EcoSphere?  (Shrimp and Gorgonia coral)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

The 1993 novel ''[[This Other Eden (novel)|This Other Eden]]'' by [[Ben Elton]] featured the development of "claustrospheres" which were closed ecological systems contained within a dome in which people could take refuge in the event of environmental collapse.

The critically panned 1996 comedy film ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' involved the protagonists becoming trapped in a closed ecological system being run as an experiment.

In [[physical cosmology]] and [[astronomy]], '''dark energy''' is an unknown form of [[energy]] which is [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] to permeate all of space, tending to [[Accelerating universe|accelerate]] the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Peebles, P.

Assuming that the [[lambda-CDM model|standard model of cosmology]] is correct, the [[Planck (spacecraft)#2013 data release|best current measurements]] indicate that dark energy contributes 68% of the total energy in the present-day [[observable universe]]. The mass–energy of [[dark matter]] and [[Baryon#Baryonic matter|ordinary (baryonic)]] [[matter]] contribute 27% and 5%, respectively, and other components such as [[neutrino]]s and [[photon]]s contribute a very small amount.&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results.

==History of discovery and previous speculation==

===Einstein's cosmological constant===
The "cosmological constant" is a constant term that can be added to [[Einstein's field equation]] of general relativity.  If considered as a "source term" in the field equation, it can be viewed as equivalent to the mass of empty space (which conceptually could be either positive or negative), or "[[vacuum energy]]".

The cosmological constant was first proposed by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] as a mechanism to obtain a solution of the gravitational [[field equation]] that would lead to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity.&lt;ref name="Einstein"&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=Harvey, Alex |title=How Einstein Discovered Dark Energy |year=2012|arxiv = 1211.6338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein gave the cosmological constant the symbol Λ (capital lambda).

The mechanism was an example of [[fine-tuning]], and it was later realized that Einstein's static universe would not be stable: local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead to either the runaway expansion or contraction of the universe. The [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting. These sorts of disturbances are inevitable, due to the uneven distribution of matter throughout the universe. Further, observations made by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 showed that the universe appears to be expanding and not static at all. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to predict the idea of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest blunder.&lt;ref&gt;Gamow, George (1970) ''My World Line: An Informal Autobiography''. p. 44: "Much later, when I was discussing cosmological problems with Einstein, he remarked that the introduction of the cosmological term was the biggest blunder he ever made in his life." – Here the "cosmological term" refers to the cosmological constant in the equations of general relativity, whose value Einstein initially picked to ensure that his model of the universe would neither expand nor contract; if he hadn't done this he might have theoretically predicted the universal expansion that was first observed by Edwin Hubble.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflationary dark energy===
[[Alan Guth]] and [[Alexei Starobinsky]] proposed in 1980 that a negative pressure field, similar in concept to dark energy, could drive [[cosmic inflation]] in the very early universe. Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of the universe slightly after the [[Big Bang]]. Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang. However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher energy density than the dark energy we observe today and is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old. It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation. Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.

Nearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]. During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% [[cold dark matter]] and 5% ordinary matter (baryons). These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: in particular, the model required a value for the [[Hubble constant]] lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering. These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of anisotropy in the [[cosmic microwave background]] by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model.  The first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations in 1998 of [[deceleration parameter|accelerated expansion]] in [[Adam Riess|Riess]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name="riess" /&gt; and in [[Saul Perlmutter|Perlmutter]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="perlmutter" /&gt; and the Lambda-CDM model then became the leading model. Soon after, dark energy was supported by independent observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]] and [[Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array|Maxima]] cosmic microwave background experiments observed the first [[Baryon acoustic oscillations|acoustic peak]] in the CMB, showing that the total (matter+energy) density is close to 100% of critical density. Then in 2001, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] gave strong evidence that the matter density is around 30% of critical. The large difference between these two supports a smooth component of dark energy making up the difference. Much more precise measurements from [[WMAP]] in 2003–2010 have continued to support the standard model and give more accurate measurements of the key parameters.

The term "dark energy", echoing [[Fritz Zwicky]]'s "dark matter" from the 1930s, was coined by [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;The first appearance of the term "dark energy" is in the article with another cosmologist and Turner's student at the time, Dragan Huterer, "Prospects for Probing the Dark Energy via Supernova Distance Measurements", which was posted to the [[ArXiv.org e-print archive]] in [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808133 August 1998] and published in {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.60.081301| title = Prospects for probing the dark energy via supernova distance measurements| journal = Physical Review D| volume = 60| issue = 8| year = 1999| last1 = Huterer | first1 = D. | last2 = Turner | first2 = M. |arxiv = astro-ph/9808133 |bibcode = 1999PhRvD..60h1301H }}, although the manner in which the term is treated there suggests it was already in general use. Cosmologist Saul Perlmutter has credited Turner with coining the term [http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html in an article] they wrote together with Martin White, where it is introduced in quotation marks as if it were a neologism. {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.670| title = Constraining Dark Energy with Type Ia Supernovae and Large-Scale Structure| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 83| issue = 4| pages = 670| year = 1999| last1 = Perlmutter | first1 = S. | last2 = Turner | first2 = M. | last3 = White | first3 = M. |arxiv = astro-ph/9901052 |bibcode = 1999PhRvL..83..670P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change in expansion over time===
[[File:Dark Energy.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram representing the accelerated expansion of the universe due to dark energy.]]
High-precision measurements of the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] are required to understand how the expansion rate changes over time and space. In [[general relativity]], the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] and the cosmological [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space). Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today. Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW metric]] leads to the [[Lambda-CDM model]], which has been referred to as the "''standard model of cosmology''" because of its precise agreement with observations.

As of 2013, the Lambda-CDM model is consistent with a series of increasingly rigorous cosmological observations, including the [[Planck spacecraft]] and the Supernova Legacy Survey. First results from the SNLS reveal that the average behavior (i.e., equation of state) of dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological constant to a precision of 10%.&lt;ref name="snls"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Astier, Pierre ([[Supernova Legacy Survey]])|title=The Supernova legacy survey: Measurement of Ω&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; and W from the first year data set|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=447|pages=31–48|year=2006|arxiv=astro-ph/0510447|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20054185|bibcode=2006A&amp;A...447...31A|last2=Guy|last3=Regnault|last4=Pain|last5=Aubourg|last6=Balam|last7=Basa|last8=Carlberg|last9=Fabbro|last10=Fouchez|last11=Hook|last12=Howell|last13=Lafoux|last14=Neill|last15=Palanque-Delabrouille|last16=Perrett|last17=Pritchet|last18=Rich|last19=Sullivan|last20=Taillet|last21=Aldering|last22=Antilogus|last23=Arsenijevic|last24=Balland|last25=Baumont|last26=Bronder|last27=Courtois|last28=Ellis|last29=Filiol|last30=Gonçalves|display-authors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent results from the Hubble Space Telescope Higher-Z Team indicate that dark energy has been present for at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration.

== Nature ==
The nature of dark energy is more hypothetical than that of dark matter, and many things about it remain matters of speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Overbye|first1=Dennis|title=Astronomers Report Evidence of 'Dark Energy' Splitting the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/22/us/astronomers-report-evidence-of-dark-energy-splitting-the-universe.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark energy is thought to be very homogeneous and not very [[density|dense]], and is not known to interact through any of the [[fundamental forces]] other than [[gravity]]. Since it is quite rarefied and un-massive — roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; — it is unlikely to be detectable in laboratory experiments. The reason dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density in spite of being so dilute, is that it uniformly fills otherwise empty space.

Independently of its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure (repulsive action), like [[radiation pressure]] in a [[metamaterial]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zhong-Yue Wang|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the observed [[Accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]]. According to general relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other objects just as its mass density does. This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the [[stress–energy tensor]], which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure and viscosity{{doubtful|date=February 2017}}. In the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]], it can be shown that a strong constant negative pressure in all the universe causes an acceleration in the expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration in contraction if the universe is already contracting. This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled "gravitational repulsion".

===Technical definition===
{{see also|Friedmann equations}}
In standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation, and dark energy. Matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the scale factor, i.e., ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;, while radiation is anything which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor (ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;). This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a square box, doubling the length of a side of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf|title=Cosmology: Part III Mathematical Tripos, Cambridge University|author=Daniel Baumann|page=21−22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final component, dark energy, is an intrinsic property of space, and so has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration (ρ ∝ a&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;). Thus, unlike ordinary matter, it does not get diluted with the expansion of space.

==Evidence of existence==
The evidence for dark energy is indirect but comes from three independent sources:

* Distance measurements and their relation to redshift, which suggest the universe has expanded more in the last half of its life.&lt;ref name="Durrer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Durrer, R. |title=What do we really know about Dark Energy?|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=369|issue=1957|pages=5102|arxiv=1103.5331|year=2011|bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369.5102D|doi=10.1098/rsta.2011.0285}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theoretical need for a type of additional energy that is not matter or dark matter to form the [[observationally flat universe]] (absence of any detectable global curvature).
* Measures of large-scale wave-patterns of mass density in the universe.

Since then, these observations have been corroborated by several independent sources. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]], [[gravitational lens]]ing, and the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos]], as well as improved measurements of supernovae, have been consistent with the [[Lambda-CDM model]].&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Spergel, D.

Supernovae are useful for cosmology because they are excellent [[standard candle]]s across cosmological distances. They allow researchers to measure the expansion history of the universe by looking at the relationship between the distance to an object and its [[redshift]], which gives how fast it is receding from us. The relationship is roughly linear, according to [[Hubble's law]]. It is relatively easy to measure redshift, but finding the distance to an object is more difficult. Usually, astronomers use standard candles: objects for which the intrinsic brightness, or [[absolute magnitude]], is known. This allows the object's distance to be measured from its actual observed brightness, or [[apparent magnitude]]. Type Ia supernovae are the best-known standard candles across cosmological distances because of their extreme and consistent [[luminosity]].

Recent observations of supernovae are consistent with a universe made up 71.3% of dark energy and 27.4% of a combination of [[dark matter]] and [[Baryon|baryonic matter]].&lt;ref name="Kowalski2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kowalski|first=Marek|author2=Rubin, David|date=October 27, 2008|title=Improved Cosmological Constraints from New, Old and Combined Supernova Datasets|journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]]|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|volume=686|issue=2|pages=749–778|doi=10.1086/589937 |arxiv=0804.4142 |bibcode=2008ApJ...686..749K|last3=Aldering|first3=G.|last4=Agostinho|first4=R.

===Cosmic microwave background===

The existence of dark energy, in whatever form, is needed to reconcile the measured geometry of space with the total amount of matter in the universe. Measurements of [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) [[anisotropy|anisotropies]] indicate that the universe is close to [[flatness problem|flat]]. For the [[shape of the universe]] to be flat, the mass-energy density of the universe must be equal to the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]]. The total amount of matter in the universe (including [[baryon]]s and [[dark matter]]), as measured from the CMB spectrum, accounts for only about 30% of the critical density. This implies the existence of an additional form of energy to account for the remaining 70%.&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; The [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) spacecraft [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Seven-year data release|seven-year analysis]] estimated a universe made up of 72.8% dark energy, 22.7% dark matter, and 4.5% ordinary matter.&lt;ref name="wmap7parameters" /&gt;
Work done in 2013 based on the [[Planck spacecraft]] observations of the CMB gave a more accurate estimate of 68.3% dark energy, 26.8% dark matter, and 4.9% ordinary matter.&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Bang’s afterglow shows universe is 80 million years older than scientists first thought|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/telescope-that-sees-big-bangs-afterglow-sees-older-universe-in-glimpse-of-first-split-second/2013/03/21/ada16076-920e-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story_1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322054138/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/telescope-that-sees-big-bangs-afterglow-sees-older-universe-in-glimpse-of-first-split-second/2013/03/21/ada16076-920e-11e2-9173-7f87cda73b49_story_1.html|archive-date=22 March 2013|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 March 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large-scale structure===
The theory of [[Observable universe#Large-scale structure|large-scale structure]], which governs the formation of structures in the universe ([[star]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[galaxy groups and clusters]]), also suggests that the density of matter in the universe is only 30% of the critical density.

A 2011 survey, the WiggleZ galaxy survey of more than 200,000 galaxies, provided further evidence towards the existence of dark energy, although the exact physics behind it remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13462926|publisher=BBC News|title=New method 'confirms dark energy'|date=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=real/&gt; The WiggleZ survey from the [[Australian Astronomical Observatory]] scanned the galaxies to determine their redshift. Then, by exploiting the fact that [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] have left [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] regularly of ~150 Mpc diameter, surrounded by the galaxies, the voids were used as standard rulers to estimate distances to galaxies as far as 2,000 Mpc (redshift 0.6), allowing for accurate estimate of the speeds of galaxies from their redshift and distance. The data confirmed [[cosmic acceleration]] up to half of the age of the universe (7 billion years) and constrain its inhomogeneity to 1 part in 10.&lt;ref name=real&gt;[http://wigglez.swin.edu.au/site/prmay2011a.html Dark energy is real], Swinburne University of Technology, 19 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a confirmation to cosmic acceleration independent of supernovae.

===Late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect===
Accelerated cosmic expansion causes [[gravitational potential well]]s and hills to flatten as [[photon]]s pass through them, producing cold spots and hot spots on the CMB aligned with vast supervoids and superclusters. This so-called late-time [[Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect|Integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect (ISW)]] is a direct signal of dark energy in a flat universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crittenden |author2=Neil Turok |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.575 |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=76 |title=Looking for $\Lambda$ with the Rees-Sciama Effect |issue=4 |pages=575–578 |year=1995 |arxiv=astro-ph/9510072 |bibcode=1996PhRvL..76..575C |pmid=10061494}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported at high significance in 2008 by Ho ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shirley Ho |author2=Hirata |author3=Nikhil Padmanabhan |author4=Uros Seljak |author5=Neta Bahcall |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.043519 |journal=Physical Review D |title=Correlation of CMB with large-scale structure: I.

===Observational Hubble constant data===
A new approach to test evidence of dark energy through observational [[Hubble constant]] data (OHD) has gained significant attention in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zelong Yi|author2=Tongjie Zhang|title = Constraints on holographic dark energy models using the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies|journal = Modern Physics Letters A|volume = 22|issue = 1|pages=41|year = 2007|doi=10.1142/S0217732307020889|arxiv=astro-ph/0605596|bibcode = 2007MPLA...22...41Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Haoyi Wan|author2=Zelong Yi|author3=Tongjie Zhang|author4=Jie Zhou|title = Constraints on the DGP Universe Using Observational Hubble parameter |journal = Physics Letters B|volume = 651|issue = 5|pages=352|year = 2007|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2007.06.053|arxiv=0706.2723 |bibcode = 2007PhLB..651..352W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cong Ma|author2=Tongjie Zhang|title = Power of Observational Hubble Parameter Data: a Figure of Merit Exploration|journal = Astrophysical Journal|volume = 730|issue = 2|pages=74|year = 2010|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/730/2/74|arxiv=1007.3787 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...730...74M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tongjie Zhang|author2=Cong Ma|author3=Tian Lan|title = Constraints on the Dark Side of the Universe and Observational Hubble Parameter Data|journal = Advances in Astronomy|volume = 2010|issue = 1|pages=1|year = 2010|doi=10.1155/2010/184284|arxiv=1010.1307 |bibcode = 2010AdAst2010E..81Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubble constant, ''H''(''z''), is measured as a function of cosmological [[redshift]].

The core of this idea is the measurement of the differential age evolution as a function of redshift of these cosmic chronometers. Thus, it provides a direct estimate of the Hubble parameter

:&lt;math&gt; H(z)=-\frac{1}{1+z} \frac{dz}{dt} \approx -\frac{1}{1+z} \frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The reliance on a differential quantity, {{sfrac|Δ''z''|Δ''t''}}, can minimize many common issues and systematic effects; and as a direct measurement of the Hubble parameter instead of its integral, like [[supernova]]e and [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] (BAO), it brings more information and is appealing in computation. For these reasons, it has been widely used to examine the accelerated cosmic expansion and study properties of dark energy.

==Theories of dark energy==
Dark energy's status as a hypothetical force with unknown properties makes it a very active target of research. The problem is attacked from a great variety of angles, such as modifying the prevailing theory of gravity (general relativity), attempting to pin down the properties of dark energy, and finding alternative ways to explain the observational data.

===Cosmological constant===
{{main|Cosmological constant}}
{{Details|Equation of state (cosmology)}}
[[File:DMPie 2013.svg|thumb|Estimated distribution of [[matter]] and [[energy]] in the universe&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planck reveals an almost perfect universe |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck/Planck_reveals_an_almost_perfect_Universe |work=Planck |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The simplest explanation for dark energy is that it is an intrinsic, fundamental energy of space. This is the cosmological constant, usually represented by the Greek letter Λ (Lambda, hence [[Lambda-CDM model]]). Since energy and mass are related according to the equation ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that this energy will have a gravitational effect. It is sometimes called a [[vacuum energy]] because it is the energy density of empty [[vacuum]].

The cosmological constant has negative pressure equal to its [[energy density]] and so causes the expansion of the universe to [[Deceleration parameter|accelerate]]. The reason a cosmological constant has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics. In general, energy must be lost from inside a container (the container must do work on its environment) in order for the volume to increase. Specifically, a change in volume ''dV'' requires work done equal to a change of energy −''P&amp;nbsp;dV'', where ''P'' is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a container full of vacuum actually increases when the volume increases, because the energy is equal to ''ρV'', where ''ρ'' is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, ''P'' is negative and, in fact, ''P''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''ρ''.

There are two major advantages for the cosmological constant. The first is that it is simple. Einstein had in fact introduced this term in his original formulation of general relativity such as to get a static universe. Although he later discarded the term after [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] found that the universe is expanding, a nonzero cosmological constant can act as dark energy, without otherwise changing the Einstein field equations. The other advantage is that there is a natural explanation for its origin. Most [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuation]]s that would give the vacuum this sort of energy. This is related to the [[Casimir effect]], in which there is a small suction into regions where virtual particles are geometrically inhibited from forming (e.g. between plates with tiny separation).

A major outstanding [[Unsolved problems in physics|problem]] is that the same [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict a huge [[cosmological constant]], more than 100 [[orders of magnitude]] too large.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; This would need to be almost, but not exactly, cancelled by an equally large term of the opposite sign. Some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Wess |first1= Julius |last2=Bagger |first2=Jonathan |title=Supersymmetry and Supergravity |isbn=978-0691025308}}&lt;/ref&gt; which does not help because supersymmetry must be broken.

Nonetheless, the cosmological constant is the most [[Occam's razor|economical solution]] to the problem of [[cosmic acceleration]]. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, includes the cosmological constant as an essential feature.

===Quintessence===
{{main|Quintessence (physics)}}
In [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] models of dark energy, the observed acceleration of the scale factor is caused by the potential energy of a dynamical [[scalar field|field]], referred to as quintessence field. Quintessence differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In order for it not to clump and form [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|structure]] like matter, the field must be very light so that it has a large [[Compton wavelength]].

No evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] and [[equivalence principle#Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle|variation of the fundamental constants]] in space or time.&lt;ref name="Carroll1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Quintessence and the Rest of the World: Suppressing Long-Range Interactions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=81|issue=15|year=1998|pages=3067–3070|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3067|arxiv = astro-ph/9806099 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.3067C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scalar field]]s are predicted by the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics and [[string theory]], but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of [[cosmological inflation]]) occurs: [[renormalization]] theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses.

The coincidence problem asks why the [[accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the Universe began when it did.  If acceleration began earlier in the universe, structures such as [[galaxy|galaxies]] would never have had time to form, and life, at least as we know it, would never have had a chance to exist. Proponents of the [[anthropic principle]] view this as support for their arguments. However, many models of quintessence have a so-called "tracker" behavior, which solves this problem. In these models, the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than) the radiation density until [[big bang|matter-radiation equality]], which triggers quintessence to start behaving as dark energy, eventually dominating the universe. This naturally sets the low [[energy scale]] of the dark energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ratra|first1=Bharat|last2=Peebles|first2=P.J.E.|title=Cosmological consequences of a rolling homogeneous scalar field|journal=Phys. Rev.|volume=D37|pages=3406|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.37.3406|bibcode=1988PhRvD..37.3406R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steinhardt|first1=Paul J.|last2=Wang|first2=Li-Min|last3=Zlatev|first3=Ivaylo|title=Cosmological tracking solutions|journal=Phys.

In 2004, when scientists fit the evolution of dark energy with the cosmological data, they found that the equation of state had possibly crossed the cosmological constant boundary (w&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1) from above to below. A No-Go theorem has been proved that gives this scenario at least two degrees of freedom as required for dark energy models. This scenario is so-called [[Quintom scenario]].

Some special cases of quintessence are [[phantom energy]], in which the energy density of quintessence actually increases with time, and k-essence (short for kinetic quintessence) which has a non-standard form of [[kinetic energy]] such as a [[negative kinetic energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.R.Caldwell|title=A phantom menace? Cosmological consequences of a dark energy component with super-negative equation of state|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=545|pages=23–29|date=2002|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(02)02589-3|issue=1–2|arxiv = astro-ph/9908168 |bibcode = 2002PhLB..545...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can have unusual properties: [[phantom energy]], for example, can cause a [[Big Rip]].

===Interacting dark energy===
This class of theories attempts to come up with an all-encompassing theory of both dark matter and dark energy as a single phenomenon that modifies the laws of gravity at various scales. This could, for example, treat dark energy and dark matter as different facets of the same unknown substance,&lt;ref&gt;See [[dark fluid]].&lt;/ref&gt; or postulate that cold dark matter decays into dark energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=Interacting dark energy models in Cosmology and large-scale structure observational tests|arxiv=1610.01272|author=Rafael J. F. Marcondes|date=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another class of theories that unifies dark matter and dark energy are suggested to be covariant theories of modified gravities. These theories alter the dynamics of the space-time such that the modified dynamic stems what have been assigned to the presence of dark energy and dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Exirifard |first=Q. |year=2010 |pages=93–106 |volume=43|title=Phenomenological covariant approach to gravity |journal=General Relativity and Gravitation |doi=10.1007/s10714-010-1073-6|bibcode = 2011GReGr..43...93E|arxiv = 0808.1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variable dark energy models===
The density of dark energy might have varied in time over the history of the universe. Modern observational data allow for estimates of the present density. Using [[baryon acoustic oscillations]], it is possible to investigate the effect of dark energy in the history of the Universe, and constrain parameters of the [[equation of state]] of dark energy. To that end, several models have been proposed. One of the most popular models is the Chevallier–Polarski–Linder model (CPL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chevallier|first1=M|last2=Polarski|first2=D|title=Accelerating Universes with Scaling Dark Matter|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=10 |pages=213–224 |year=2001|arxiv=gr-qc/0009008|bibcode = 2001IJMPD..10..213C |doi = 10.1142/S0218271801000822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linder|first1=Eric V.|title=Exploring the Expansion History of the Universe|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=3 March 2003|volume=90|issue=9|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.091301|arxiv=astro-ph/0208512v1|bibcode = 2003PhRvL..90i1301L|pmid=12689209|page=091301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other common models are, (Barboza &amp; Alcaniz. 2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alcaniz|first1=E.M.|last2=Alcaniz|first2=J.S.|title=A parametric model for dark energy|journal=Physics Letters B |volume=666 |pages=415–419 |year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2008.08.012|arxiv = 0805.1713 |bibcode = 2008PhLB..666..415B }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Jassal et al. 2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jassal|first1=H.K|last2=Bagla|first2=J.S|title=Understanding the origin of CMB constraints on Dark Energy|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=405 |pages=2639–2650 |year=2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16647.x |arxiv = astro-ph/0601389 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2639J }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Wetterich. 2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wetterich|first1=C.|title=Phenomenological parameterization of quintessence|date=2004|arxiv=astro-ph/0403289v1|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2004.05.008|volume=594|journal=Physics Letters B|pages=17–22|bibcode = 2004PhLB..594...17W }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Oztas et al. 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oztas|first1=A.|last2=Dil|first2=E.|last3=Smith|first3=M.L.|title=The varying cosmological constant: a new approximation to the Friedmann equations and universe model|date=2018|doi=10.1093/mnras/sty221|volume=476|journal=Mon.

===Observational skepticism===
Some alternatives to dark energy aim to explain the observational data by a more refined use of established theories. In this scenario, dark energy doesn't actually exist, and is merely a measurement artifact. For example, if we are located in an emptier-than-average region of space, the observed cosmic expansion rate could be mistaken for a variation in time, or acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiltshire |first=David L. |year=2007 |title= Exact Solution to the Averaging Problem in Cosmology |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=99 |issue= 25|page=251101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.251101 |pmid=18233512 |bibcode=2007PhRvL..99y1101W|arxiv = 0709.0732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ishak, Mustapha |author2=Richardson, James |author3=Garred, David  |author4=Whittington, Delilah |author5=Nwankwo, Anthony  |author6=Sussman, Roberto  |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.78.123531 |journal=Physical Review D|title=Dark Energy or Apparent Acceleration Due to a Relativistic Cosmological Model More Complex than FLRW? |volume=78 |issue=12 |pages=123531 |year=2007 |arxiv=0708.2943|bibcode = 2008PhRvD..78l3531I}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mattsson, Teppo |doi=10.1007/s10714-009-0873-z|journal=Gen.

==Other mechanism driving acceleration==
===Modified gravity===
The evidence for dark energy is heavily dependent on the theory of general relativity. Therefore, it is conceivable that a modification to general relativity also eliminates the need for dark energy. There are very many such theories, and research is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citejournal|author1=M. Sami|author2=R.

Astrophysicist [[Ethan Siegel]] states that, while such alternatives gain a lot of mainstream press coverage, almost all professional astrophysicists are confident that dark energy exists, and that none of the competing theories successfully explain observations to the same level of precision as standard dark energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel|first1=Ethan|title=What Astronomers Wish Everyone Knew About Dark Matter And Dark Energy|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/04/10/what-astronomers-wish-everyone-knew-about-dark-matter-and-dark-energy/|accessdate=11 April 2018|work=Forbes (Starts With A Bang blog)|date=2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for the fate of the universe==
Cosmologists estimate that the [[Deceleration parameter|acceleration]] began roughly 5 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Frieman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frieman|first=Joshua A.|last2=Turner|first2=Michael S.|last3=Huterer|first3=Dragan|date=2008-01-01|title=Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243|journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=46|issue=1|pages=385–432|arxiv=0803.0982|bibcode=2008ARA&amp;A..46..385F|doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.46.060407.145243}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1= &lt;ref name="Frieman" /&gt; Frieman, Turner &amp; Huterer (2008) p. 6: "The Universe has gone through three distinct eras: radiation-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≳ 3000}}; matter-dominated, {{math|3000 ≳ ''z'' ≳ 0.5}}; and dark-energy-dominated, {{math|''z'' ≲ 0.5}}. The evolution of the scale factor is controlled by the dominant energy form: {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + ''w'')}} (for constant {{mvar|w}}). During the radiation-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}; during the matter-dominated era, {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;}}; and for the dark energy-dominated era, assuming {{math|''w'' {{=}} −1}}, asymptotically {{math|''a''(''t'') ∝ exp(''Ht'')}}."&lt;br /&gt;

This implies that the Universe began accelerating at redshift {{math|''z'' ∼}}&amp;nbsp;0.4 and age {{math|''t'' ∼}}&amp;nbsp;10&amp;nbsp;Gyr. These results are robust – data from any one method can be removed without compromising the constraints – and they are not substantially weakened by dropping the assumption of spatial flatness."|group="notes"}} Before that, it is thought that the expansion was decelerating, due to the attractive influence of matter. The density of dark matter in an expanding universe decreases more quickly than dark energy, and eventually the dark energy dominates. Specifically, when the volume of the universe doubles, the density of [[dark matter]] is halved, but the density of dark energy is nearly unchanged (it is exactly constant in the case of a cosmological constant).

Projections into the future can differ radically for different models of dark energy. For a cosmological constant, or any other model that predicts that the acceleration will continue indefinitely, the ultimate result will be that galaxies outside the [[Local Group]] will have a [[radial velocity|line-of-sight velocity]] that continually increases with time, eventually far exceeding the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-end-of-cosmology |title=The End of Cosmology?|journal= Scientific American |date=March 2008|author1=Krauss, Lawrence M.  |author2=Scherrer, Robert J. | volume= 82|accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not a violation of [[special relativity]] because the notion of "velocity" used here is different from that of velocity in a local [[inertial frame of reference]], which is still constrained to be less than the speed of light for any massive object (see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|Uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion of the subtleties of defining any notion of relative velocity in cosmology). Because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can actually be cases where a galaxy that is receding from us faster than light does manage to emit a signal which reaches us eventually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031123150109/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 |date=2003-11-23 }} (see the last two paragraphs)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ly93&gt;{{cite web|last = Lineweaver|first = Charles|author2 = Tamara M.

Assuming the dark energy is constant (a [[cosmological constant]]), the current distance to this cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' would eventually be able to reach us in the future if the event were less than 16 billion light years away, but the signal would never reach us if the event were more than 16 billion light years away.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;

As galaxies approach the point of crossing this cosmological event horizon, the light from them will become more and more [[redshift]]ed, to the point where the wavelength becomes too large to detect in practice and the galaxies appear to vanish completely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Krauss|first = Lawrence M.|author2=Robert J.

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment "And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared. The entire universe will disappear before our very eyes, and it's one of my arguments for actually funding cosmology. We've got to do it while we have a chance."&lt;/ref&gt; (''see'' [[Future of an expanding universe]]). Planet Earth, the [[Milky Way]], and the Local Group of which the Milky way is a part, would all remain virtually undisturbed as the rest of the universe recedes and disappears from view. In this scenario, the Local Group would ultimately suffer [[heat death of the universe|heat death]], just as was hypothesized for the flat, matter-dominated universe before measurements of [[accelerating expansion of the universe|cosmic acceleration]].

There are other, more speculative ideas about the future of the universe. The [[phantom energy]] model of dark energy results in ''divergent'' expansion, which would imply that the effective force of dark energy continues growing until it dominates all other forces in the universe. Under this scenario, dark energy would ultimately tear apart all gravitationally bound structures, including galaxies and solar systems, and eventually overcome the [[electric force|electrical]] and [[nuclear force]]s to tear apart atoms themselves, ending the universe in a "[[Big Rip]]". It is also possible the universe may never have an end and continue in its present state forever{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} (see [[Ludwig Boltzmann#Second thermodynamics law as a law of disorder|The second thermodynamics law as a law of disorder]]). On the other hand, dark energy might dissipate with time or even become attractive. Such uncertainties leave open the possibility that gravity might yet rule the day and lead to a universe that contracts in on itself in a "[[Big Crunch]]",&lt;ref name=HTUW&gt;{{cite AV media | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | year=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that there may even be a dark energy cycle, which implies a [[cyclic model|cyclic model of the universe]] in which every iteration ([[Big Bang]] then eventually a [[Big Crunch]]) takes about a [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9114-cyclic-universe-can-explain-cosmological-constant.html 'Cyclic universe' can explain cosmological constant], NewScientistSpace, 4 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Steinhardt &amp; Turok 2002"&gt;{{cite journal

==In philosophy of science==
In [[philosophy of science]], dark energy is an example of an "auxiliary hypothesis", an [[Ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]] postulate that is added to a theory in response to observations that [[falsifiability|falsify]] it. It has been argued that the dark energy hypothesis is a [[conventionalism#Epistemology|conventionalist]] hypothesis, that is, a hypothesis that adds no empirical content and hence is [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] in the sense defined by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Merritt|Merritt, David]] [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219816301563 "Cosmology and Convention"], ''Studies In History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies In History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', '''57'''(1):41–52, February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern gdubfding Highlands moist deciduous forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] ecoregion of east-central [[India]]. The ecoregion covers an area of {{convert|341,100|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, extending across portions of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Odisha]], and [[Telangana]] states.

==Setting==
The Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests extend from the [[Bay of Bengal]] coast in northern Andhra Pradesh and southern Orissa, across the northern portion of the [[Eastern Ghats]] range and the northeastern [[Deccan Plateau]], to the eastern [[Satpura Range]] and the upper [[Narmada River]] valley. 

The forests of the ecoregion are sustained by the moisture-bearing [[monsoon]] winds from the [[Bay of Bengal]], which lies to the southeast. The ecoregion is bounded on the north and west by [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry deciduous forest]] ecoregions, including the [[Central Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]] to the southwest and west, the [[Narmada valley dry deciduous forests]] to the northwest, and the [[Chota Nagpur dry deciduous forests]] to the north and northeast. The drier [[Northern dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, lying west of the Eastern Ghats range, is completely surrounded by the Eastern Highlands moist deciduous forests, in the [[rain shadow]] of the Ghats, which partially block the moisture-laden monsoon winds off the Bay of Bengal. The humid [[Orissa semi-evergreen forests]] ecoregion lies to the northeast in the coastal lowlands of Orissa.

==Flora==
The ecoregion's forests are dominated by [[Sal tree|Sal]] ''(Shorea robusta)'', in association with ''[[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]], [[Adina (plant)|Adina]], [[Toona]], [[Syzygium]], [[Buchanania]], [[Cleisanthus]],'' and ''[[Anogeissus]]''. The flora of the ecoregion shares many affinities with the moist forests of the [[Western Ghats]] and the eastern [[Himalaya]]s.

==Conservation==
Approximately 25% of the original habitat remains, much of it in blocks of 5000 km² or larger. 31 protected areas, totaling 13,500 km², preserve about 4% of the ecoregion's intact habitat. The largest protected area in the ecoregion is [[Simlipal National Park]] in [[Odisha]] state.&lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002).

Lithuania is net energy importer. 
Primary energy use in Lithuania was 98 TWh, or 29 TWh per million people in 2009.&lt;ref name=IEA2010&gt;[http://www.iea.org/textbase/nppdf/free/2010/key_stats_2010.pdf IEA Key energy statistics 2010] Page: Country specific indicator numbers from page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic diversification of energy imports and resources is Lithuania's key energy strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lsta.lt/files/seminarai/2015-04-09_Ryga/03.-ey-bus-2015-rokas-masiulis.pdf |title=Lithuania’s Energy Sector Development Trends|format=PDF|page=2|website=www.lsta.lt|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Long term aims were defined in National Energy Independence strategy in 2012 by Lietuvos Seimas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://gamyba.le.lt/sites/default/files/media/dynamic/files/481/nationalenergyindependencestrategy.pdf | title= National Energy Independence Strategy |format=PDF|website=gamyba.le.lt|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was estimated that strategic energy independence initiatives will cost {{euro}}6.3–7.8 billion in total and provide annual savings of {{euro}}0.9-1.1 billion. 
In 2018 synchronising the Baltic States' electricity grid with the [[Synchronous grid of Continental Europe]] has started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-18-4285_en.htm |title= Questions and answers on the synchronisation of the Baltic States' electricity networks with the continental European network (CEN) | date=28 June 2018 | accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gas Interconnection Poland–Lithuania]] (GIPL), also known as Lithuania–Poland pipeline, is a proposed natural gas pipeline interconnection between Lithuania and Poland that is expected to be finished by 2019.

Natural gas companies in Lithuania include [[Lietuvos Dujos]].

==Electricity==
Lithuania imports 70% of its power mostly from [[Sweden]], and the average price of electricity is among the highest in EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_and_natural_gas_price_statistics Electricity and natural gas price statistics] ''EuroStat'', May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statnett.no/Drift-og-marked/Data-fra-kraftsystemet/Nordisk-kraftflyt/ Current electricity flows] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218031130/http://www.statnett.no/Drift-og-marked/Data-fra-kraftsystemet/Nordisk-kraftflyt/ |date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutdelors.eu/media/balticstateseu-energypolicy-grigas-ne-jdi-july13.pdf?pdf=ok&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, transmission lines connected Lithuania to [[NordBalt|Sweden (700MW)]] and [[LitPol Link|Poland (500MW)]].

== Renewable energy ==
{{main|Renewable energy in Lithuania}}
[[File:Vejo jegaine, 2006-09-02.jpg|thumb|Wind turbine in Lithuania]]
In 2016 [[Renewable energy in Lithuania]] constituted 27.9% of the country's overall electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://osp.stat.gov.lt/informaciniai-pranesimai?articleId=5146928]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/8-18062012-AP/EN/8-18062012-AP-EN.PDF ]&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the Lithuanian government aimed to generate 23% of total power from renewable resources by 2020, a goal was achieved in 2014 (23.9).

With new installed wind capacity of 178 MW in 2016, and an average power consumption of 1.1 GW, Lithuania is the EU Member State with the highest level of installed wind capacity relative to its power consumption (ratio of 16%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/statistics/WindEurope-Annual-Statistics-2016.pdf |title=Wind in power - 2016 European statistics |publisher=Wind Europe |format=PDF | page=18 |access-date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant]], its main purpose is to provide a spinning reserve of the power system, to regulate the load curve of the power system 24 hours a day. Installed capacity of the pumped storage plant: 900 MW (4 units, 225 MW each). [[Kaunas Hydroelectric Power Plant]], it supplies about 3% of the electrical demand in Lithuania.&lt;ref name=kh&gt;{{cite web|title=Kauno HE modernizavimas|publisher=[[Lietuvos Energija]]|url=http://www.lpc.lt/lt/main/system/he_modern|accessdate=2008-01-09|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation of company name==
According to the company, Esri is pronounced as a word, 'ez-ree'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adena Schutzberg |url=http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/esri-transitioning-pronunciation-of-its-name/162035 |title=ESRI "Transitioning" Pronunciation of its Name |website=Directionsmag.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some distributors outside of the USA such as [[Esri Canada]] market themselves with the 'ess-ree' pronunciation followed by the country name.

==Products==
{{Main article|ArcGIS}}
Esri uses the name [[ArcGIS]] to refer to its suite of GIS software products, which operate on desktop, server, and mobile platforms. ArcGIS also includes developer products and web services. In a general sense, the term GIS describes any [[Information systems|information system]] that integrates, stores, edits, analyzes, shares and displays [[georeference|geographic]] information for informing [[decision making]]. The term GIS-Centric, however, has been specifically defined as the use of the Esri ArcGIS geodatabase as the asset and feature data repository central to [[computerized maintenance management system]]s (CMMS) as a part of [[enterprise asset management]] and analytical software systems. GIS-centric certification criteria have been specifically defined by NAGCS, the National Association of GIS-Centric Solutions.

===Desktop GIS===
As of February 2018, the company's desktop GIS suite is [[ArcGIS]] for Desktop version 10.6. ArcGIS for Desktop consists of several integrated applications, including [[ArcMap]], [[ArcCatalog]], [[ArcToolbox]], [[ArcScene]], [[ArcGlobe]], and [[ArcGIS Pro]]. The suite's main components, [[ArcMap]], [[ArcCatalog]] and [[ArcToolbox]], allow users to author, analyze, map, manage, share, and publish geographic information. The product suite is available in three levels of licensing:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop/pricing |title=Buy ArcGIS for Desktop |website=Esri.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic (formerly called [[ArcView]]), Standard (formerly called [[ArcEditor]]) and Advanced (formerly called [[ArcInfo]]). Basic (ArcView) provides a basic set of GIS capabilities suitable for many GIS applications. Standard (ArcEditor), at added cost, allows more extensive data editing and manipulation, including server [[geodatabase]] editing.  Advanced ([[ArcInfo]]), at the high end,  provides full, advanced analysis and data management capabilities, including [[geostatistics|geostatistical]] and [[Geospatial topology|topological]] analysis tools. Additionally, ArcGIS is compatible with following OGC standards: WFS, WCS, GFS and various others. 

[[ArcGIS Explorer]], [[ArcReader]],  and [[ArcExplorer]] are basic [[freeware]] applications for viewing GIS data.

ArcGIS for Desktop Extensions are available, including Spatial Analyst for raster analysis, and 3D Analyst for terrain mapping and analysis.  Other more specialized extensions are available from Esri and third parties.

Esri's original product, [[ArcInfo|ARC/INFO]], was a command line GIS product available initially on minicomputers, then on UNIX workstations. In 1992, a GUI GIS, [[ArcView 3.x|ArcView GIS]], was introduced. Over time, both products were offered in Windows versions, and ArcView also as a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] product. The names ArcView and ArcInfo are now used to name different levels of licensing in ArcGIS for Desktop, and less often refer to these original software products. The Windows version of ArcGIS is now the only ArcGIS for Desktop platform that is undergoing new development for future product releases.

===Server GIS===
Server GIS products provide GIS functionality and data deployed from a central environment. [[ArcGIS Server|ArcGIS for Server]] is an Internet application service, used to extend the functionality of ArcGIS for Desktop software to a browser based environment. It is available on Solaris and Linux as well as Windows. [[ArcSDE]] (Spatial Database Engine) is used as an [[Relational database management system]] connector for other Esri software to store and retrieve GIS data within a commercially available database: currently, it can be used with Oracle, [[PostgreSQL]], DB2, Informix and Microsoft SQL Server databases. It supports its native SDE binary data format, [[Oracle Spatial]], and ST_geometry.
[[ArcIMS]] (Internet Mapping Server) provides browser-based access to GIS. As of ArcGIS 10.1, ArcIMS has been depreciated in favour of ArcGIS for Server, but there are still many instances of ArcIMS (10.0 and older) in production environments.
Other server-based products include Geoportal Extension, [[ArcGIS Image Server]] and Tracking Server as well as several others.

===Mobile GIS===
Mobile GIS conflates GIS, GPS, [[location-based service]]s, hand-held computing, and the growing availability of geographic data. ArcGIS technology can be deployed on a range of mobile systems from lightweight devices to PDAs, laptops, and Tablet PCs. The firm's products for this use are   [[ArcPad]], ArcGIS for Mobile, ArcGIS for Server (Server-oriented [[API]]s), ArcWeb Services (Web-oriented [[API]]s),  hosted geographic databases, ArcGIS mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile GIS App Development|url=http://www.webmapsolutions.com|publisher=WebMapSolutions|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ArcGIS for mobile ADF is an application programming interface (API) for developing solutions on various Windows Mobile and Windows-embedded platforms (pocket PC, smartphone, ultra-mobile devices, etc.).

===Developer GIS===
Developer GIS products enable building custom desktop or server GIS applications or embed GIS functionality in existing applications. These focused solutions can then be deployed throughout an organization. The firm's products for this are   Esri Developer Network or EDN, [[ArcEngine]] (Desktop-oriented [[API]]s), ArcGIS for Server (Server-oriented [[API]]s and a web development ADF which is part of ArcGIS for Server), [[ArcWeb Services]] (Web-oriented [[API]]s).

===Online GIS (ArcGIS Online)===
ArcGIS includes Internet capabilities in all Esri software products. The services, provided through ArcGIS Online at www.arcgis.com, include web APIs, hosted map and geoprocessing services, and a user sharing program. A variety of basemaps is a signature feature of ArcGIS Online. The Esri Community Maps program compiles detailed user basemap information into a common cartographic format called Topographic Basemap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Mobile app for ArcGIS Online|url=http://www.webmapsolutions.com/arcgisonline|publisher=WebMapSolutions|accessdate=16 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130209095417/http://www.webmapsolutions.com/arcgisonline|archivedate=9 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data formats==

===Vector===
* '''[[Shapefile]]''' – Esri's somewhat open, hybrid vector data format using SHP, SHX and DBF files.
* '''Enterprise Geodatabase''' – Esri's geodatabase format for use in an [[Relational database system|RDBMS]].
* '''File Geodatabase''' – Esri's file-based geodatabase format, stored as folders in a file system.
* '''Personal Geodatabase''' – Esri's closed, integrated vector data storage strategy using Microsoft's [[Microsoft Access|Access]] MDB format.
* '''Coverage''' – Esri's closed, hybrid vector data storage strategy. Legacy ArcGIS Workstation / ArcInfo format with reduced support in ArcGIS Desktop lineup.

===Raster===
* [[Esri grid]] – binary and metadataless ASCII raster formats.
*  [http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/manage-data/raster-and-images/what-is-a-mosaic-dataset.htm Mosaic] - data structure for managing and analyzing multidimensional raster and imagery data, including [[netCDF]], [[GRIB]], and [[Hierarchical Data Format]]

==Esri Technical Certification==
The Esri Technical Certification program was launched in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earn the New Esri Technical Certification|url=http://www.esri.com/news/releases/10_4qtr/technical-cert.html|publisher=Esri|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program provides an exam based certification for Esri software.  The core groups for the certification include Desktop, Developer, and Enterprise.  Each subcategory under these groups have two certification levels, Associate and Professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Certification|url=http://training.esri.com/certification/|work=Esri|accessdate=4 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Esri Conservation Program==

In 1989, the [http://www.conservationgis.org Esri Conservation Program] was started to help change the way nonprofit organizations carried out missions of nature conservation and social change. This program provides GIS software, data, and training, as well as helping to coordinate multiorganizational efforts (e.g. [http://www.scgis.org The Society for Conservation GIS]).

==Federal investigation==

On June 28, 2006, an Esri official said that the company had received a federal [[subpoena]] as part of the ongoing investigation into the ties between [[Jerry Lewis (California politician)|Jerry Lewis]] and [[Copeland Lowery]]. "We have no concerns," Esri spokesman Don Berry said. "We retain a lobbyist and it is not an issue for us." On September 5, 2006, the Associated Press reported that federal investigators were looking into a donation of {{convert|41|acre|m2}} of land to the city of [[Redlands, California|Redlands]] by the owners of Esri in 2001, land adjacent to the home of Lewis. In late November 2010, the US Department of Justice notified Lewis's attorneys that the case had been concluded and closed without charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Justice Department closes long-running case involving Rep. Lewis |author=Ben Goad |newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]] |date=2010-12-03 |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/stories/PE_News_Local_D_lewis04.2edc8f6.html |accessdate=December 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flute's Journey: The Life of a Wood Thrush''''' is a children's picture book by [[Lynne Cherry]].

==Plot summary==
The book tells the first year of a [[wood thrush|wood thrush's]] life starting from it hatching in a forest that is in [[Maryland]]. Two children see the bird when it is young and calls it Flute. The children wait for Flute to return from [[bird migration|migration]] and watch him and his [[Mating|mate]] build a [[bird nest|nest]] and raise their young. In Flute's travels, he encounters many dangers. The [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[nestlings]] are at more of a risk.

==Reception==
A review in the book ''Gotcha!: Nonfiction Booktalks to Get Kids Excited about Reading'' says, "Whether or not you know much about songbirds and the dangers they face, this book is great reading, and it includes ideas for things that kids can do to help them. The illustration of Flute's mother feeding her babies a worm is a good one to show."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FQrW4WYRKs4C&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=Flute%27s+Journey:+The+Life+of+a+Wood+Thrush&amp;lr=#PPA44,M1  Gotcha!: Nonfiction Booktalks to Get Kids Excited about Reading]&lt;/ref&gt; Books use the book for activities for kids to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q8oYWI7KFi0C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Flute%27s+Journey:+The+Life+of+a+Wood+Thrush&amp;lr= Writing with Authors Kids Love]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KPNotFXqXQ0C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=Flute%27s+Journey:+The+Life+of+a+Wood+Thrush&amp;lr= Young Adult Literature in the Classroom]&lt;/ref&gt; The book focused national media attention on conservation efforts to save the Belt Woods in Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhousenet.org/network/dcarea.html Green House Network] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081227091029/http://www.greenhousenet.org/network/dcarea.html |date=December 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundary is defined on the appearance of the complex, vertical trace fossil Treptichnus (formerly Phycodes) pedum.]]

The '''Fortunian [[stage (geology)|stage]]''' marks the beginning of the [[Phanerozoic]] eon, the [[Paleozoic]] era, and the [[Cambrian]] period. It is the first of the two stages of the [[Terreneuvian]] series. Its base is defined as the first appearance of the trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' {{Period start|Fortunian}} million years ago. The top of the Fortunian which is the base of the [[Cambrian Stage 2|Stage 2]] of the Cambrian has not been formally defined yet, but will correspond to the appearance of an [[Archeocyatha]] species or "Small shelly fossils" approximately {{Period start|Stage 2}} million years ago.&lt;ref name="GSSP Web"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/index.html |publisher=International Commission of Stratigraphy |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115175854/http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/index.html |archivedate=15 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Fortunian is derived from a part of the [[Burin Peninsula]], the town of [[Fortune, Newfoundland and Labrador|Fortune]] near the GSSP and [[Fortune Bay]].&lt;ref name="Landing Fortunian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Landing|first=E|title=THE BASE OF THE CAMBRIAN: TERRENEUVIAN SERIES AND FORTUNIAN STAGE|url=http://www.palaeontology.geo.uu.se/ISCS/ISCS_Terreneuvian_Fortunian_2007.pdf|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GSSP==
The type locality ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|GSSP]]) of the Fortunian stage is in [[Fortune Head]], at the northern edge of the [[Burin Peninsula]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]] ({{Coord|47.0762|N|55.8310|W|display=inline}}). This GSSP coincides with the beginning of the [[Terreneuvian]] series, the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary and the beginning of the Phanerozoic. The outcrops show a carbonate-siliciclastic succession which is mapped as the [[Chapel Island Formation]]. The formation is divided into the following members that are composed of peritidal sandstones and shales (Member 1), muddy deltaic and shelf sandstones and mudstones (Member 2A), laminated siltstones (Member 2B and 3) and mudstones and limestones of the inner shelf (Member 4). The Precambrian-Cambrian boundary lies 2.4 m above the base of the 2nd member which is the lowest occurrence of ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]''. The traces can be seen on the lower surface of the sandstone layers. The first calcareous shelled skeletal fossils ''([[Ladatheca cylindrica]])'' is 400 m above the boundary. The first [[trilobites]] appear 1400 m above the boundary which corresponds to the beginning of the [[Branchian Series]].&lt;ref name="Brasier 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasier|first=Martin|author2=John Cowie |author3=Michael Taylor |title=Decision on the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary stratotype|journal=Episodes|year=1994|volume=17|issue=1–2|pages=95–100|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/GSSP/file46.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eastern South Australia Satellite Photo.jpg|thumb|273px|Satellite image of vegetation and desert in [[South Australia]]. [[George Goyder]] provided advice as to the geographic limits of crop growing in South Australia.]]
'''Goyder's Line''' is a line that runs roughly east-west across [[South Australia]] and, in effect, joins places with an average annual [[rainfall]] of {{convert|10|in|mm|}}. North of Goyder's Line, annual rainfall is usually too low to support [[crop|cropping]], with the land being only suitable for [[grazing]]. Related to that, the line also marks a distinct change in [[vegetation]]. To the south, it is composed mainly of [[mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]] scrub, whilst [[saltbush]] predominates to the north of the line.

==History==
[[Image:Goyders Line within South Australia.png|thumb|left|302px|Approximation of Goyder's Line within South Australia]]
With barely 30 years' knowledge of this new country, farmers needed reliable information about the climate and growing conditions. In 1865 [[George Goyder]], the then [[Surveyor General of South Australia|Surveyor-General]] of the colony, was asked to map the boundary between those areas that received good rainfall and those experiencing [[drought]]. After traversing an estimated 3200&amp;nbsp;km on horseback (not including the [[Eyre Peninsula]]) in November 1865, he submitted his report and map to the state government on 6 December. The map included a line of demarcation, the areas north of which being those Goyder judged "liable to drought", with the areas to the south deemed [[arable land|arable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Goyder's Line |first=R A |last=Heathcote |journal=People and Plants in Australia |editor=DJ and SGM Carr |publisher=Academic Press |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; He discouraged farmers from planting crops north of his line, declaring this land suitable only for light [[grazing]]. Goyder's report was based on the information already in his office, supplemented by the observations made during the 1865 journey to observe the effects of drought. He was guided in drawing the line by the changes in vegetation, especially various kinds of saltbush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southernflinders-midnorth.com.au/narrate/n_goyder.htm |title=Goyder's Line |publisher=The Mid North and Southern Flinders Ranges |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ample rains fell in 1865, prompting farmers to ignore Goyder's report and settle in the north, starting farms and planting crops. The idea that [[rain follows the plow]], developed during the contemporaneous westward expansion of cropping in the [[United States]], encouraged this trend. A few years later, many had to abandon their properties. The land was indeed unsuitable for crops, and Goyder was proved correct. Many [[farmhouse]] ruins can still be seen in the vicinity of Goyder's line.&lt;ref name="line150"/&gt;

Goyder's Line was embodied in Schedule 1 of the ''Waste Lands Alienation Act 1872'' which prohibited purchase of land on credit outside of designated agricultural areas. However a few good seasons led to the repeal of that act in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sahistoryhub.com.au/subjects/goyders-line |title=Goyder's Line |first=Judith |last=Jeffery |publisher=History Trust of South Australia |work=SA History Hub |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other periods of development north of the line but, invariably, adverse conditions proved decisive. Entire towns and farms were abandoned when there was a return to longer-term average rainfall patterns. The line has proven highly accurate, a notable feat given the relatively limited knowledge of the local climate at the time it was surveyed.

In December 2015, climate scientist Peter Hayman acknowledged that the current "warming, drying trend" of South Australia's climate would definitely "put a downward shift on Goyder's Line" towards the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Goyder's Line moving south with climate change, SA scientists say, forcing farming changes |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-02/goyders-line-climate-change-wheat-wine-grapes/6919276 |date=2 December 2015 |work=ABC News |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |first1=Michael |last1=Dulaney |first2=Daniel |last2=Keane |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goyder's Line starts on the west coast near [[Ceduna, South Australia|Ceduna]] and runs south-east across the [[Eyre Peninsula]] to strike [[Spencer Gulf]] near [[Arno Bay, South Australia|Arno Bay]]. It continues from near [[Moonta, South Australia|Moonta]] north to [[Crystal Brook, South Australia|Crystal Brook]] and [[Orroroo, South Australia|Orroroo]], then south-east past [[Peterborough, South Australia|Peterborough]] and [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]] to the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n border near [[Pinnaroo, South Australia|Pinnaroo]], crossing the [[Murray River]] south of [[Blanchetown, South Australia|Blanchetown]]. Agriculture is possible north of the line near the Murray River, only because of [[irrigation]] using water drawn from the river.

When flying over the area, the distinct change in [[flora (plants)|flora]] makes it possible to see the approximate path of Goyder's Line.

==Cultural significance==
Goyder's Line became a [[National Trust of Australia]] Heritage Icon&lt;ref name="line150"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-09/goyders-line150-anniversary/6999656 |date=9 December 2015 |title=Rain, grain and drought: Life on Goyder's Line after 150 years |first1=Michael |last1=Dulaney |first2=James |last2=Jooste |accessdate=12 February 2016 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The Goyder Line was also mentioned in the [[Redgum]] song "Virgin Ground" from the 1980 [[Virgin Ground|album of the same name]], and in the song "Spark of the Heart", from their 1984 album [[Frontline (album)|''Frontline'']].

Other states have similar conditions where parts of a state are arable but other parts are suitable only for pastoral grazing, however no other state has a surveyed line equivalent to Goyder's line.&lt;ref name="line150"/&gt;

The '''Inter-Allied Games''' was a one-off multi-sport event held from June 22 to July 6, 1919 at the newly constructed [[Stade Pershing|Pershing Stadium]] just outside [[Paris]], [[France]] following the end of [[World War I]]. The host stadium had been built near the [[Bois de Vincennes]] by the U.S. Military in cooperation with the [[YMCA]]. The event was only open to participation by military personnel who were currently serving or had formerly served in the armed forces during the War. Around 1500 athletes from a total of eighteen nations participated in the proceedings which featured nineteen sports. Following the conclusion of the games, Pershing Stadium was presented as a gift to the people of France from the United States of America.  The area, still known as Le Stade Pershing, continues to be used as an open air recreation park to this day.

==Sports==
A total of nineteen sports were contested at the games. A number of military-oriented events was initially planned, but only [[hand-grenade]] throwing and shooting made it on to the final programme.

==Participating nations==
A total of twenty-eight nations from the [[Allies of World War I]] were invited to the competition and eighteen nations accepted the invite. China aimed to compete, but ultimately was unable to send any athletes to the games within the time scale. It did, however, provide medals and trophies in support of the games. The [[Kingdom of Hejaz]] sent a delegation but with no athletes, choosing to demonstrate the skills of their Arabian horsemen instead. A full list of participants was made by the organisers.

The '''TVA Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill''' occurred just before 1 a.m. on Monday December 22, 2008, when an ash [[Levee|dike]] ruptured at an {{convert|84|acre|km2|adj=on}} solid waste containment area at the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] in [[Roane County, Tennessee]]. {{convert|1.1|e9USgal|m3}} of [[coal]] [[fly ash]] [[slurry]] was released. The [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power plant]], located across the [[Clinch River]] from the city of [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], uses ponds to dewater the fly ash, a [[Coal combustion products|byproduct of coal combustion]], which is then stored in wet form in dredge cells. The slurry (a mixture of fly ash and water) traveled across the [[Emory River]] and its Swan Pond embayment, on to the opposite shore, covering up to {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of the surrounding land, damaging homes and flowing up and down stream in nearby waterways such as the Emory River and Clinch River ([[Tributary|tributaries]] of the [[Tennessee River]]). It was the largest fly ash release in United States history.

==Details==
[[File:TVAHouseflood.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A collapsed house inundated by the spill.]]
The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) and [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) initially estimated that the spill released 1.7 million cubic yards (1.3 million m³) of sludge, which is gray in color.&lt;ref name=Discovery&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/12/25/tennessee-coal-ash.html|title=Tenn.

TVA spokesman Gil Francis Jr. said that the TVA was "taking steps to stabilize runoff from this incident." In response to a video that showed dead fish on the Clinch River, which had received [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the spill, he stated "in terms of toxicity, until an analysis comes in, you can't call it toxic." He continued by saying that "it does have some [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] within it, but it's not toxic or anything."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Chandra Taylor, an attorney with the [[Southern Environmental Law Center]], called this statement irresponsible, and stated that coal fly ash contains concentrated amounts of mercury, arsenic, and [[benzene]]. She added, "These things are naturally occurring, but they concentrate in the burning process and the residual is more toxic than it starts."&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; Nevertheless, due to pressure exerted in 2000 by [[Public utility|utilities]], the [[Coal in the United States|coal industry]], and [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] officials, fly ash is not strictly regulated as a toxic pollutant by the EPA.&lt;ref name=seattletimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2008558917_sludge25.html|title=Massive coal-ash spill causes river of sludge and controversy|publisher=[[The Seattle Times]]|author=Dewan, Shaila|date=2008-12-25|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents and environmental groups expressed concern that the fly ash slurry could become more dangerous once it dries out, but have as yet received no information about this from the TVA.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; On January 1, 2009, the TVA disseminated a fact sheet stating that the ash is "not hazardous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/jan/03/epa-found-high-arsenic-levels-day-after-ash-spill/|title=EPA found high arsenic levels day after ash spill|publisher=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]|date=2009-01-03|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the EPA and [[Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation]] awaited the results of soil and water testing to judge their response, while the [[Tennessee Emergency Management Agency]] indicated that barriers would be constructed to stop the ash from reaching the [[Tennessee River]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; By early on December 24, 2008, a flyover by ''[[The New York Times]]'' did note repair work being done on the nearby [[railroad]], which had been obstructed when {{convert|78000|cuyd|m3}} of sludge covered tracks.&lt;ref name=KnoxTrip /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; By the afternoon of that day, [[dump truck]]s were being used to deposit rock into the Clinch River to prevent the further downstream contamination.&lt;ref name=seattletimes/&gt; The TVA had also slowed river flow, for the same purpose.&lt;ref name=commondreams/&gt; The slurry that was cleared from Swan Pond Road was brought back to one of the plant's intact containment ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wbir.com/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=72819&amp;catid=2|title=Crews storing ash sludge nearby|publisher=[[WBIR-TV]]|date=2008-12-28|accessdate=2009-01-09|author=Matheny, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December 30, 2008, the TVA had announced it was requesting the assistance of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to dredge the ash-filled Emory River to restore navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/dec/30/tennessee-corps-dredge-river-around-kingston-plant/?breakingnews|title=Tennessee: Corps to dredge river around Kingston plant|publisher=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|date=2008-12-30|accessdate=2009-01-09|author=Flessner, Dave|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113163238/http://timesfreepress.com/news/2008/dec/30/tennessee-corps-dredge-river-around-kingston-plant/?breakingnews|archive-date=2009-01-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2009 the TVA announced that rather than attempting to clear away all the slurry, they would be spraying seed, straw, and mulch on top of much of it, "to combat dust and erosion".&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/jan/01/tva-spread-seed-and-straw-kingston-spill-site/|title=TVA to spread seed and straw at Kingston spill site|publisher=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]|date=2009-01-01|accessdate=2009-01-09|author=Balloch, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisa Evans, an attorney for the environmental group [[Earthjustice]] (headquartered in Oakland, CA), spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue. She also blamed the industry for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases. She stated that "The saddest thing is this is entirely avoidable. These people in these communities don't have to be in harm's way. This is not some complicated problem like nuclear waste. This is something the utilities know how to do."&lt;ref name=AP2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/12/24/ap5858629.html|title=Cleanup begins in wake of Tennessee ash pond flood|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|author=Duncan Mansfield|date=2008-12-24|accessdate=2008-12-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, told ''The New York Times'' that the ash should have been buried in [[Landfill liner|lined]] [[landfills]] to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater (as recommended in a 2006 EPA report), and stated that "I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, on-site the week of the spill, acknowledged that the [[Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation]], which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA's own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells."Believe me, there will be a full-bore look at this to understand the causes of this thing and to try to make sure it never happens again," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesfreepress.com/news/2009/jan/05/tennessee-early-warnings-ash-pond-leaks/?local|title=Tennessee: Early Warning on Ash Leaks|date=2009-01-05|author=Flessner,Sohn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern has also been expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site.&lt;ref name=seattletimes/&gt; On December 27, 2008 the TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although Stephen Smith of the [[Southern Alliance for Clean Energy]] and Chris Irwin of United Mountain Defense told ''[[The Tennessean]]'' newspaper that they believe the TVA knows what is in it, due to the TVA having tested it prior to the spill.&lt;ref name=Tennessean&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20081228/NEWS01/81228006/1006|title=Coal ash precautions issued around spill|date=2008-12-28|accessdate=2009-01-09|publisher=[[The Tennessean]]|author=Paine, Anne}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and [[manganese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/us/30sludge.html?_r=1&amp;em|title=At Plant in Coal Ash Spill, Toxic Deposits by the Ton|publisher=[[New York Times]]|author=Dewan, Shaila|date=2008-12-29|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it is believed that the area of the spill may contain "hot spots" of higher toxicity.&lt;ref name=Tennessean /&gt;

In response to independent attempts at sampling of the water quality and the taking of photos, the TVA illegally detained, for approximately one hour, two members of the [[Knoxville, Tennessee]]-based environmental organization [[United Mountain Defense]] who were traversing public land in the area of the spill,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Environmentalists-Detained-for-Photographing-Tennessee-Ash-Spill-100941.shtml|title=Environmentalists Detained for Photographing Tennessee Ash Spill|publisher=[[Softpedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cited three other individuals, warning them that any attempt to enter the public waterway again would lead to prosecution.

TVA president [[Tom Kilgore]] said that, in light of the spill, the Authority would consider switching the Kingston plant over to "dry" byproduct methods, which would reduce the chances of another spill. Five TVA-operated plants use this method, while Kingston and another five use a "wet" process.&lt;ref name=AP2 /&gt; The power plant continues to operate, with waste being sent to one of the two remaining intact containment ponds.&lt;ref name=commondreams/&gt;

On December 26, 2008 the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation stated that it was satisfied with the water quality in the wake of the spill but that it will continue to examine and deal with the potential for chronic health effects.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98741603|title=Coal Ash May Pose Health Hazard|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=2008-12-26|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee governor [[Phil Bredesen]] toured the spill site on December 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2009/jan/01/bredesen-visits-site-of-retention-pond-spill|author=Lakin, Matt|date=2009-01-01|accessdate=2009-01-09|title=Bredesen visits site of retention pond spill|publisher=[[Knoxville News-Sentinel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Senate]] [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Environment and Public Works Committee]], which oversees the TVA, held a hearing on January 8 to examine the disaster.

==Legal actions==
On December 23, 2008 the environmental group [[Greenpeace]] asked for a criminal investigation into the incident, focusing on whether the TVA could have prevented the spill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-calls-for-criminal|title=Greenpeace calls for criminal investigation into coal ash spill|publisher=[[Greenpeace]]|date=2008-12-23|accessdate=2009-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230023103/http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/press-center/releases2/greenpeace-calls-for-criminal|archive-date=2008-12-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28390371/|title=Sludge from dike is twice the original estimate|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|date=2008-12-26|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, 2008 a group of landowners filed suit against the TVA for $165 million in Tennessee state court.&lt;ref name=Sue&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=6546366 |title=Landowners Sue TVA for $165M Over Coal Ash Spill |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2009-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528211536/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=6546366 |archivedate=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on December 30, 2008 the [[Southern Alliance for Clean Energy]] announced its intention to sue the TVA under the federal [[Clean Water Act]] and the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]].&lt;ref name=Sue /&gt;

"On February 4, 2009, EPA, pursuant to Executive Order 12088, and TDEC issued a letter to TVA in which EPA provided notice to TVA that EPA considers the release to be an unpermitted discharge of a pollutant in contravention of the Clean Water Act."&lt;ref name="EPAAOAC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tva.gov/kingston/tva_epa.pdf|title=Administrative Order and Agreement on Consent U.S. EPA Region 4 and Tennessee Valley Authority|date=2009-05-06|accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2009 "TVA and the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced today an EPA Order and Agreement that documents the relationship between TVA and EPA in managing the clean-up of the Kingston ash spill and further ensures that TVA will meet all federal and state environmental requirements in restoring affected areas."&lt;ref name="TVAAOAC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tva.gov/news/releases/aprjun09/epa.htm|title=TVA, EPA Sign Agreement on Site Clean-up at Kingston|date=2009-05-11|accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the time-critical phase of the EPA Order was to expedite the removal of ash from the Emory River.  The ash resided in the Emory River subject to significant migration in heavy storms.  Over 3.5 million cubic yards were removed in a 12-month period, with 85% being removed in a 10-month time frame.  The time-critical phase accelerated the removal of ash from the river by 75% over original expectations and safely transported it to a permanent, lined and [[leachate]] collecting facility in Perry County, Alabama called Arrowhead landfill.  Arrowhead landfill is located on a thick layer of Selma chalk.  Significant benefits were derived by the receiving community in both jobs and county improvements.  The once-closed Emory River was reopened in late spring 2010 and has been reopened for full community use with only minor wake zone restrictions.  Drinking water continues to remain safe for consumption, and air quality associated with the site continues to meet federal standards.  The time-critical phase removed 90% of the ash located in the Emory River, leaving about 500,000 cubic yards of material which will be addressed in the next phase of the clean-up.    A more comprehensive report of the actions was finalized in March 2011 and can be found at [http://www.epakingstontva.com/Work%20Plan%20Approvals/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fWork%20Plan%20Approvals%2fOSC%20REPORT&amp;FolderCTID=&amp;View=%7bFD51B683%2dDA50%2d40E4%2dAFF8%2dA1C4757A0078%7d. EPA OSC Report for the Time Critical Removal Action] 
 
In August 2010, the non-time-critical phase began removing ash from the remaining, more contained embayment and began preparations for closing out the failed dredge cell with an earthquake-proof subsurface wall and cap. In addition, the non-time-critical phase is conducting ecological evaluations concerning the remaining risks of the ash in the river.

Critics of the EPA's response claim the solution was an act of environmental racism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/digest/five_questions_for_robert_bullard_on_the_flint_michigan_water_crisis|title=Five Questions for Robert Bullard On the Flint Water Crisis and Justice - Yale E360|website=e360.yale.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roane county's population is 91% Caucasian.

A number of workers suffered health effects in the years following the spill at the cleanup site. A federal jury ruled in favor of the workers seeking compensation in November 2018. The plaintiffs alleged contractor Jacobs Engineering for failing to keep workers safe from environmental hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2018/11/07/verdict-reached-favor-sickened-workers-coal-ash-cleanup-lawsuit/1917514002/|title=Jury: Jacobs Engineering endangered Kingston disaster clean-up workers|last=Satterfield|first=Jamie|newspaper=Knoxville News Sentinel|date=November 7, 2018|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mode and mechanism==
According to the [[AECOM]] report commissioned by TVA and released June 25, 2009, failure occurred due to a variety of causes, primarily due to liquefaction of layers of "slimes" and other water-saturated materials deep within the growing ash pile. Collapse occurred over the course of approximately one hour in consecutive waves of breaking away and sliding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tva.gov/kingston/rca/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721020014/http://www.tva.gov/kingston/rca/ |archivedate=2009-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plant and spill location==
[[File:Kingston-fossil-plant-design1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Original design of the ash disposal area]]
The Kingston Fossil Plant is located on a peninsula at the junction of the Emory River (to the north) and Clinch River (to the south and east), just over {{convert|4|mi|km}} upstream from the latter's mouth along the Tennessee River.  [[Watts Bar Dam]], located along the Tennessee {{convert|38|mi|km}} downstream from the mouth of the Clinch, impounds a reservoir (Watts Bar Lake) that spans a {{convert|72|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the Tennessee (to [[Fort Loudoun Dam]]), the lower {{convert|23|mi|km}} of the Clinch (to [[Melton Hill Dam]]), and the lower {{convert|12|mi|km}} of the Emory. The plant, originally known as the Kingston Steam Plant, was built in the early 1950s primarily to provide electricity to atomic energy installations at nearby [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Tennessee Valley Authority Office of Engineering Design and Construction, ''The Kingston Steam Plant: A Report on the Planning, Design, Construction, Costs, and First Power Operations'' (Tennessee Valley Authority Technical Report no. 34, 1965), pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant's ash pond disposal area is located immediately north of the plant along the peninsula's Emory River shore. The ponds were originally created by diking off part of the lake at the Emory's confluence with Swan Pond Creek, which flows down from [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] (just over the ridge to the northwest).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The disposal area consists of the main ash pond (where ash is initially dumped), which is flanked on the southeast by a stilling pond (where water from the main pond is placed to further separate it from the ash) and on the northwest by "dredge cells," where ash from the main pond is placed to further solidify. The [[dike breach]] occurred at the northwest corner of the dredge cell area, overlooking the Swan Pond Creek spillway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2008/12/25/us/20081225_SLUDGE_GRAPHIC.html|title=Site of the Spill, and How Fly Ash Is Produced|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-12-25|accessdate=2009-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahmudur Rahman''' ({{lang-bn|মাহমুদুর রহমান }}; born 6 July 1953) is the one of the owners and acting editor of one of [[Bangladesh]]'s [[Bengali language|Bengali]] daily newspapers, ''[[Amar Desh]]''. He is also an engineer and businessman.

Established in business, Mahmudur Rahman was appointed the executive chairman of the National Investment Board in 2002, and then elevated to national energy adviser in 2005. In both positions, Rahman set high goals for attracting foreign investments and increasing energy capacity in Bangladesh. While he had success in attracting foreign investors, he also took controversial steps such as increasing petrol prices or developing open-pit mines that set off protests across the country.

Since the restoration of civilian government and the [[Awami League]] victory in 2008, Rahman has been a strong critic of the government through his newspaper. Party and government officials have reacted by charging him with [[defamation]] and [[sedition]] cases more than 50 times since 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=AJZ /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC /&gt; He is the only person to be sentenced for contempt by the [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=ns /&gt;&lt;ref name=sentenced&gt;{{cite news |date=19 August 2010 |title=Mahmudur jailed for contempt of court |url=http://ns.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=171085&amp;cid=2 |newspaper=bdnews24.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FNaeZq5U?url=http://www.newstatesman.com/newspapers/2010/08/court-bangladesh-amar-contempt |archivedate=25 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=21 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ARFreed&gt;{{cite news |date=17 March 2011 |title=Mahmudur Rahman freed |url=http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=9dd28afc29684433c16b3855ae3cb9b6&amp;nttl=2011032016886 |newspaper=Banglanews24.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316024133/http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=9dd28afc29684433c16b3855ae3cb9b6&amp;nttl=2011032016886 |archive-date=16 March 2012 |accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cpj&gt;{{cite web|title=Editor, journalist jailed for contempt in Bangladesh |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=20 August 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2013 |url=http://www.cpj.org/2010/08/editor-journalist-jailed-for-contempt-in-banglades.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; International human rights groups and press organisations have characterised the government's actions against him as judicial harassment.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |first1=Elizabeth |last1=Yuan |first2=Farid |last2=Ahmed |date=1 March 2013 |title=Seeking war crimes justice, Bangladesh protesters fight 'anti-Islam' label |work=CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/27/world/asia/bangladesh-protests/ |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fidh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fidh.org/Ongoing-judicial-harassment,9477 |title=Ongoing judicial harassment against Mr. Mahmudur Rahman – BGD 001 / 0610 / OBS 075.3 |date=8 April 2011 |publisher=International Federation for Human Rights |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have said he has misrepresented bloggers and activists associated with the [[2013 Shahbag protests]] and contributed to widespread religious tensions and civil unrest.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;{{cite news |date=24 February 2013 |title=Protesters vow to resist anti-lib forces |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2900317731.html |work=The New Nation |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also earned an [[M.B.A.]] from the [[Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka|Institute of Business Administration]], [[Dhaka University]].

He married Firoza Khan, the daughter of [[Harunur Rashid Khan Monno]]. The latter has been politically affiliated with the BNP since independence.&lt;ref name=headlines /&gt;

==Business career==

After returning to Bangladesh, Rahman started and developed his own company, Artisan Ceramics Limited in 1999.&lt;ref name=headlines /&gt; It was the first bone china plant in the country and a technological breakthrough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 August 2000 |title=Finance Minister draws attention to domestic market |url=http://www.bangla2000.com/news/archive/business/8-23-2000/news_detail1.html |newspaper=Bangla 2000 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artisan Ceramics was sold in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sajjadur |last=Rahman |date=25 August 2013 |title=Finlay makers buy Mahmudur Rahman's Artisan Ceramics |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/finlay-makers-buy-mahmudur-rahmans-artisan-ceramics/ |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

=== National Investment Board ===
Rahman was appointed by the administration of [[Khaleda Zia]] as chair of the National Investment Board.&lt;ref name=headlines /&gt; In 2002, he described the obstacles to foreign investment in Bangladesh as the "five 'I's": "image, information, infrastructure, implementation and inefficiency" and committed the government to achieving change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 October 2002 |title=Corruption, poor infrastructure repelling investment |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-68809887.html |location=Dhaka |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the opening of the power plant Meghna Energy Limited in Kanchpur, to the government's energy deregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= 23 May 2002 |title=Independent power plant opens at Kanchpur |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-53194634.html |location=Dhaka |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2002 and 2003, foreign investment in Bangladesh increased from $52 million to US$121 million, an increase which Rahman said was the greatest in South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-99259908.html |title=Foreign investment doubles to US$121 million in Bangladesh: U.N. report |author=Julhas Alam |date=22 September 2004 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the United Nations reported that foreign investment in Bangladesh had reached a record US$460 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-113628605.html |title=Bangladesh receives record US$460 million in foreign direct investment in 2004, UN says |author=Julhas Alam |date=29 September 2005 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political unrest arose in 2004. On 21 August, grenade attacks at an opposition Awami League rally killed 20 and injured around 300 others. General strikes against Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government were held regularly throughout the end of the year. Rahman criticized both sides, saying that such political violence and unrest threatened much-needed foreign investment, and the government had to provide security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-98559568.html |title=Foreign investment threatened by unrest in Bangladesh, official says |author=Julhus Alam |date=31 August 2004 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered his resignation in December 2004, reportedly over a dispute with officials in the [[Prime Minister's Office (Bangladesh)|Prime Minister's Office]], but Zia declined to accept it. Rahman continued in the post for the remainder of his "two-year contractual obligation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 December 2004 |title=BOI chief's resignation not accepted |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-103215556.html |location=Dhaka |work=The Independent |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman's goal was to attract US$1 billion in investment to Bangladesh while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 March 2005 |title=Bangladesh expects investment rise |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/03/200841013483295819.html |work=Al Jazeera |archivedate=22 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FJoFmJ90?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/03/200841013483295819.html |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that Bangladesh's infrastructure needed improvement. The government encouraged foreign investment in infrastructure through a "build-own-transfer" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-106265312.html |title=Bangladesh targets US$1 billion in foreign investment in 2006 |author=Julhas Alam |date=11 March 2005 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2005, Rahman announced a deal with the US company [[Vulcan Inc.]] to invest $1.6 billion in new power and fertiliser plants, projected to increase Bangladesh's energy capacity by nearly 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 May 2005 |title=Bangladesh gets $1.6bn investment |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/05/2008410111252757113.html |work=Al Jazeera |accessdate=22 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FJoROPKo?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/05/2008410111252757113.html |deadurl=no |archivedate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, Rahman sued five members of the [[Centre for Policy Dialogue]], a private think tank, for [[defamation]] after they criticised his investment policy. He said they had made "disgraceful, false and fabricated statements".&lt;ref name="warrants"/&gt; The ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' said the suit and issuance of related arrest warrants, was an example of "persecution of intellectuals critical of the government" and the persons sued were renowned in their field.&lt;ref name="warrants"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1092377531.html |title=Arrest warrants against Zia government critics |date=10 August 2006 |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Adviser ===
The June 2005 explosion at [[Niko Resources]]' Tengratila Gas Field in [[Sunamganj District]], was the second during the project to revive the Chattack field. Against accusations that Niko had bribed Energy Adviser Mosharraf Hossain, he resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-134172580.html |title=Bangladesh—a second blowout has hit the Niko Resources project to revive the Chattak natural gas field |date=4 July 2005 |work=Petroleum Intelligence Weekly |publisher= {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-110446953.html |title=Villagers flee homes as fire burns at Bangladesh gas field |date=25 June 2005 |publisher=Associated Press Worldbeam {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman was named to succeed him.&lt;ref name=headlines /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energybangla.com/index.php?mod=article&amp;cat=SomethingtoSay&amp;article=733 |title=Mahmudur Rahman and His Energy Vision |last=Saleque |first=Khondkar Abdus |date=7 June 2008 |website=Energy Bangla |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009105007/http://www.energybangla.com/index.php?mod=article&amp;cat=SomethingtoSay&amp;article=733 |archive-date=9 October 2011 |accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2005, he announced completion of a deal with the British oil company Cairn Energy to explore oil and gas deposits offshore Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-112199177.html |title=Cairn Energy signs deal to explore gas and oil off Bangladesh |date=16 August 2005 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, Rahman participated in talks for a transborder natural gas pipeline from Burma's [[Arakan State]] to India, to pass through Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-112835089.html |title=India's petroleum minister visits Bangladesh; pipeline talks 'constructive' |date=5 September 2005 |publisher=Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was shelved in early October 2005 after Bangladesh asked for additional trade concessions, and Burma and India chose to develop a direct route between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Subir Bhaumik |date=7 October 2005 |title=Indian gas deal to sideline Dhaka |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4318174.stm |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FJsBgkKz?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4318174.stm |archivedate=22 March 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Rahman accused Burma and India of having encroached on thousands of square miles of Bangladeshi territorial waters for natural gas exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1414954061.html |title=Dhaka-Yangon to discuss maritime boundary, gas search |date=18 January 2008 |agency=Indo-Asian News Service |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahman was involved in talks between the government and India's Tata Group in early 2006 over a $300 million proposal to build steel and fertiliser factories, as well as a power plant.&lt;ref name=headlines /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Waliru Rahman |date=8 February 2006 |title=Bangladesh power deal in balance |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4694580.stm |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FJpDaj1V?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4694580.stm |archivedate=22 March 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the talks were unsuccessful, Rahman opened talks with Pakistan's [[Dawood Group]] in August 2006 on a more modest $30 million deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1101886051.html |title=After no to Tata, Bangladesh woos Pakistan's Dawood Group |date=21 August 2006 |work=Hindustan Times |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Rahman announced a 16 percent increase in petrol prices to aid the government-owned [[Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation]], due to the price increases for crude oil on world markets. The price hikes sparked protests in Dhaka, and the government adopted a five-day workweek to conserve energy. It expected that the private sector would follow the government example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-112863286.html |title=Bangladesh introduces five-day workweek to save energy after oil price jump |date=6 September 2005 |publisher= Associated Press {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, Rahman announced an additional one-third increase in petrol prices, as well as a 10 percent increase in diesel and kerosene prices, one of the largest fuel-price hikes in Bangladesh's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 June 2006 |title=Bangladesh fuel prices up by 10% |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5061698.stm |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FJoogoxM?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5061698.stm |archivedate=22 March 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2006, protesters demanded Rahman's resignation as energy adviser and burned him in effigy in response to plans by the British corporation Asia Energy (now Global Coal, [[GCM Resources]]) to develop an open-pit coal mine in Phulbari, Dinajpur district.&lt;ref name="2010protest"&gt;{{cite news |date=10 December 2010 |title=Massive demo in London in support of Phulbari movement against Asia Energy |url=http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=c876914f82ce54cb533b186afd41166e |newspaper=BanglaNews24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224172420/http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=c876914f82ce54cb533b186afd41166e |archive-date=24 February 2013 |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists said that the mine would cause environmental damage, threaten water supply, and displace up to 120,000 residents of the area, including the Shantal [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name="2010protest"/&gt; On the first day of protests, police killed six persons and 300 were injured in a massive protest of 30,000 people outside the local Asia Energy offices. The protests spread and the next day, twenty people were injured. Students at Dhaka University joined the effort. An estimated 70,000 people in total joined the protests across the country.&lt;ref name="2010protest"/&gt; As of December 2010, the mine was still being protested and the government had not awarded a contract for its development.&lt;ref name="2010protest"/&gt;

In 2006 Rahman urged calm, saying, "This incident has sent the wrong message to foreign investors, which we cannot afford at all when we are struggling hard to woo more and more investment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 August 2006 |title=Bangladesh coal mine protest spreads |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/08/200841015949276971.html |work=Al Jazeera |agency=Reuters |archivedate=22 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FJnjVFTB?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/08/200841015949276971.html |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 August 2006 |title=Strike urged over Bangladesh mine |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/08/2008410115343541975.html |work=Al Jazeera |agency=Reuters |archivedate=22 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FJnrDLCw?url=http://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2006/08/2008410115343541975.html |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caretaker government ===
[[Khaleda Zia]]'s government ended in October 2006 and, under the constitution, elections are supposed to take place within three months, or January 2007. That fall there was a fierce struggle among the numerous parties, 14 of which were part of an Awami League-alliance and several were allied with the BNP. The [[caretaker government]] was trying to bring all parties to the table to settle election questions amidst rising tensions and violence.&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt; ''Arab News'' noted when reporting the late November 2006 incident below, that "At least 40 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes between rival parties since late October."&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt;

As an ex-energy adviser,&lt;ref name="secret"/&gt; Rahman kept in touch with colleagues from the BNP in the government. On 24 November 2006, journalists and TV news reporters took photos of 44 BNP administration officials, some retired like Rahman and others incumbents, leaving Rahman's office after a midnight meeting; many tried to hide their faces. A spokesman from the Awami League said that the men were meeting to try to "rig" the scheduled January 2007 election for BNP and its allies.&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt; Rahman denied the charge, saying he was holding a "private party" for friends to see his new office.&lt;ref name="secret"/&gt; The Awami League (and allies) called for a boycott of the scheduled January 2007 elections, demanding electoral reform.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangladesh-election/hasina-led-alliance-to-boycott-bangladesh-elections-idUSDHA15142020070103 Hasina-led alliance to boycott Bangladesh elections]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, the military led by [[Moeen U Ahmed|General Moeen]] took over the caretaker government, and imposed a [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref name="barred"&gt;{{cite news |date=11 April 2007 |title=Politicians barred from visiting Khaleda Zia's residence |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200704110341.htm |newspaper=The Hindu |agency=PTI |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222644/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/003200704110341.htm |archive-date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the then Presidential Adviser and Minister [[Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury]], Army Chief, Lt. Gen. Moeen was the main force in the military intervention and declaration by President Iajuddin Ahmed of a state of emergency on 11 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsfrombangladesh.net/view.php?hidRecord=300534&lt;/ref&gt; ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thikana.net/?q=softwork/news_print&amp;news_id=4&amp;edition=12|title=Individual News Print - THIKANA|work=thikana.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mukhlesurrahmanchowdhury.webs.com/challengegenmoeen.htm |script-title=জেনারেল মঈন উ আহমেদ একজন জাতীয় বেঈমানঃ |trans-title= |website=Mukhlesur Rahman Chowdhury |language=bn |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418220754/http://mukhlesurrahmanchowdhury.webs.com/challengegenmoeen.htm |archive-date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moeen and his associates selected that illegal government's Chief Advisor Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmed. Prof. Dr. Iauddin Ahmed continued as President. In March 2007, the caretaker government charged Khaleda Zia's two sons with corruption. In April, it announced a ban on politicians visiting the former prime minister, under the conditions of the emergency.&lt;ref name="barred"/&gt; The CTG also charged some of Zia's ministers with corruption. Also in April 2007, the CTG sued [[Sheikh Hasina]], leader of the Awami League, for graft.&lt;ref name="barred"/&gt;

On 31 March 2007, the Establishment Ministry (under the caretaker government) announced that it had completed a three-person inquiry into the actions of some of the senior officials at the November 2006 meeting with ex-energy advisor Rahman. As a result, it reassigned 13 men out of office to positions as "officers on special duty" (OSD).&lt;ref name="OSD"&gt;{{cite news |date=31 March 2007 |title=Uttara 'conspiracy' officers found guilty, shunted out of office |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2007/03/31/uttara-conspiracy-officers-found-guilty-shunted-out-of-office |newspaper=BDNews24 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the men were "joint secretaries, four deputy secretaries and six senior assistant secretaries."&lt;ref name="OSD"/&gt;

The CTG in late 2008 began to prepare for an election that year. In October 2008, shortly before the December election, Rahman filed a complaint with the [[Anti Corruption Commission Bangladesh|Anti-Corruption Commission]] (ACC), against its chair General [[Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury]]. Rahman accused the BNP appointee of having misappropriated 224.1 million [[Bangladeshi taka|taka]] in a money-laundering scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1669820591.html |title=ACC chairman ready to quit |date=4 December 2008 |work=The New Nation |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNB193 /&gt; After an investigation, on 19 March 2009, an ACC internal committee dismissed the complaint as "baseless and unmotivated".&lt;ref name=UNB193/&gt; It noted that Rahman had failed to appear personally before the committee to provide evidence.&lt;ref name=UNB193&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1665722021.html |title=ACC committee trashes Mahmudur's money-laundering complaint against General Mashhud as baseless, motivated |date=19 March 2009 |publisher=United News of Bangladesh {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Awami League government charged the 13 bureaucrats of what had become known as the "Uttara Conspiracy" with [[sedition]]. They received bail. At that time, eleven were still serving in the government and two had retired.&lt;ref name="bail"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2058874481.html |title=HC upholds bail of 13 bureaucrats |date=16 June 2010 |work=The New Nation |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newspaper career==
In 2008, Mahmudur Rahman bought the ownership of the Bengali-language, daily newspaper ''[[Amar Desh]],'' and was appointed acting editor. He has made it a leading opposition paper.&lt;ref name=kas&gt;{{cite news|first1=Alastair |last1=Carthew |first2=Simon |last2=Winkelmann |title=Bangladesh – Archive: Second Half 2010 |publisher=Konrad Adenauer-Stiftung  |accessdate=17 March 2013 |url=http://www.kas.de/medien-asien/en/pages/11830/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a19onclosedforce&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Opposition Newspaper Raided by Police And Forced to Close |date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |publisher=Article 19 |url=http://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/1554/en/bangladesh:-opposition-newspaper-raided-by-police-and-forced-to-close}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shutdown /&gt;

On 28 December 2008, the day before national elections, an [[Awami League]] committee chairman accused Rahman of collaborating to print fake ballot papers with his presses in order for BNP supporters to rig the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1668489461.html |title=Mahmudur Rahman accused of making bid to rig votes: 4-party using militants in electioneering: AL |date=28 December 2008 |work=The New Nation |accessdate=22 March 2013 |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Awami League-coalition won the 2008 election by an overwhelming margin, winning two-thirds of the seats in Parliament. It had promised to set up an International Crimes Tribunal to prosecute war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War.

===Legal disputes===
On 2 October 2009, ''Amar Desh'' reported that the [[Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission]] had hired Indian employees, and that their presence threatened state security. The BTRC sued the paper for defamation on 28 October, noting that the Indian nationals had been appointed by the United Nations, rather than the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1888589451.html |title=Amar Desh authorities sued by state-run BTRC; Court summons Desh editor, publisher, 2 reporters |date=28 October 2009 |publisher=United News of Bangladesh {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, the energy minister, Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury, sued ''Amar Desh'' for defamation over a December 2009 article alleging that he and Sajeeb Wazed Joy Hasina, the son of Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]], had received bribes from [[Chevron Corporation]] to secure contracts in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=tawfik&gt;{{cite news |date=19 January 2010 |title=Tawfik sues Amar Desh |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2010/01/19/tawfik-sues-amar-desh |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 December 2009 |title=Amar Desh newsmen sued in Jhenaidah, Gaibandha |url=http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2009/12/28/88043.html |location=Dhaka |newspaper=The Financial Express |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenslade&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenslade |first=Roy |date=3 June 2010 |title=Bangladesh newspaper closed down |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2010/jun/03/press-freedom-bangladesh |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the story was published, the reporter was physically attacked by unknown persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/141/155/76fdc8d-94b2e9b.pdf |title=Battle for Democracy: Press Freedom in South Asia, 2009–2010 |publisher=International Federation of Journalists |page=12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326160425/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/141/155/76fdc8d-94b2e9b.pdf |archive-date=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in response to the article on Hasina and Chowdhury, Awami League members had already filed 24 defamation charges against ''Amar Desh'' before the energy minister did.&lt;ref name=cpj /&gt;&lt;ref name=tawfik /&gt;

[[Reporters Without Borders]] reported that on 1 June 2010, the government sent more than 100 police to arrest Rahman and close down the paper's printing press.&lt;ref name=rsfonclosedforce/&gt; National media also carried news of the paper's shutdown and editors' arrest.&lt;ref name=a19onclosedforce/&gt;&lt;ref name=shutdown&gt;{{cite news |date=1 June 2010 |title=Govt closes Amar Desh |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2010/06/01/govt-closes-amar-desh |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2 June 2010 |title=Amar Desh shut |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=141097 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Reporters without Borders, Mohammad Hasmat Ali, publisher of ''Amar Desh'', the previous day had been taken by the National Security Intelligence (NSI), interrogated, and forced to sign two blank pieces of paper. NSI agents later filled these in with the following statements:
# Ali claimed still to be the newspaper’s publisher after having transferred ownership to Rahman’s media company, and

On 17 March 2011, Mahmudur Rahman was freed from prison.

===Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal===
In fulfilment of its campaign promises, the Awami government initiated a Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal to bring justice related to war crimes committed during the Bangladesh liberation war in 1971.

Less than a month after Rahman's release, on 28 March 2011 a judge issued an arrest order for him and two other journalists for defamation charges related to an April 2010 article reporting that certain Awami Party leaders of Kotalipara and their relatives were on the war crimes suspects' list of the International Crimes Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 March 2011 |title=Arrest warrant against Mahmudur Rahman |url=http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=b86b8c4fa6f55a31dd1964bd374d654f&amp;nttl=2011032917596 |newspaper=banglanews24.com |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628171431/http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=b86b8c4fa6f55a31dd1964bd374d654f&amp;nttl=2011032917596 |archivedate=28 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge issued the arrest order for the three journalists because they failed to appear in court; but they had notified him of an earlier case requiring them to be in a Dhaka court the same day. Journalist organisations criticized the arrest order, saying a person could not appear before two courts the same day. They said that the government was disregarding the 2 February 2011 legislation passed by Parliament, which had "nullified the provision of issuing arrest warrants against newsmen in defamation cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 March 2011 |title=Fresh arrest warrant against Mahmudur issued |url=http://newagebd.com/newspaper1/archive_details.php?date=2011-03-28&amp;nid=13346 |newspaper=New Age |accessdate=9 April 2013 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, Mahmudur Rahman had been subject to 49 legal cases under the Awami government, most for defamation.&lt;ref name=casesnowtotal49&gt;{{cite news |date=29 March 2011 |title=Mahmudur secures bail |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2011/03/29/mahmudur-secures-bail |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In protesting the charges, [[Amnesty International]] said, "The government of Bangladesh must ensure that everyone, in particular journalists and editors, are free to express their views and opinion peacefully without being harassed, intimidated, detained or tortured."&lt;ref name="risk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/bangladesh-journalist-faces-sedition-charges-2013-01-08 |title=Bangladesh newspaper editor at risk |date=8 January 2013 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutions and convictions by the International Tribunal have resulted in rising political tensions among some interests. [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]], the largest Islamist party, led a one-day strike that developed into violent riots when one of its top officials was convicted. The [[2013 Shahbag protests]], supported by many students and younger people, began 5 February 2013 in Dhaka after one of the men convicted of war crimes was sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death, as two others were. Protesters demanded that persons convicted of war crimes be sentenced to death, and Jamaat-e-Islami be banned from politics because of the violence of its followers.&lt;ref name="arrest-1"/&gt; On 24 February, protest leaders called for the arrest of Mahmudur Rahman, accusing him of inciting communal violence and sedition because of ''Amar Desh'' coverage of bloggers and activists.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt; Demonstrators said Rahman had reported "fabricated" news.&lt;ref name=bdnews24-22Mar2013&gt;{{cite news |date=23 February 2012 |title=Case against Mahmudur Rahman |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/23/case-against-mahmudur-rahman |newspaper=bdnews24 |archivedate=24 March 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FMT01qSC?url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/23/case-against-mahmudur-rahman |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shahbag&gt;{{cite news |date=23 February 2013 |title=BNP hints govt hand in Shahbagh protest |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/23/bnp-hints-govt-hand-in-shahbagh-protest |newspaper=bdnews24.com |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February, Home Minister [[Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir]] met with protesters and pledged to take measures against Rahman. In response, the editor has called the Shahbag movement "nothing but fascism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 February 2013 |title=Mahmudur takes a jibe at protesters, press |url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/26/mahmudur-takes-a-jibe-at-protesters-press |newspaper=bdnews24 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FMSivKyj?url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/02/26/mahmudur-takes-a-jibe-at-protesters-press |archivedate=24 March 2013 |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview earlier in February with ''Prime News'', Rahman had said,

Islam-affiliated parties held large demonstrations on 6 April 2013, with protesters demanding a new blasphemy law with a penalty of death.

Noting that blasphemy laws covered "hurting religious sentiment," the government charged four bloggers of eleven it identified as posting anti-Muslim material.

===Reactions to arrest===

International human rights groups criticised the government's actions and called for the release of Rahman and the four bloggers. Protesting were [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Crackdown on Bloggers, Editors Escalates |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=17 April 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2013 |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/04/15/bangladesh-crackdown-bloggers-editors-escalates|quote="By targeting peaceful critics in the media and blogosphere and promising more arrests, the government is abandoning any serious claim that it is committed to free speech.

In addition, press organisations supported release of the publisher and bloggers, and urged the government to protect freedom of the press. They included [[International Federation of Journalists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 April 2013 |title=Bangladesh Should Immediately Release Detained Editor, Bloggers |url=http://asiapacific.ifj.org/en/articles/bangladesh-should-immediately-release-detained-editor-bloggers |publisher=International Federation of Journalists |accessdate=12 April 2013 |quote="As the political confrontation between the ruling party and the opposition in Bangladesh escalates, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) calls for the immediate cessation of all hostile actions against journalists and free speech activists."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Committee to Protect Journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editor of pro-opposition daily arrested in Bangladesh |publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists |date=12 April 2013 |quote="We are concerned by the arrest of Mahmudur Rahman.

Bangladesh politicians and activists generally responded in terms of their affiliations. Concerns expressed included that the government was increasing tensions, and opposition leaders urged freedom of the press. Representatives of the Awami League and those who opposed Rahman repeated accusations against him. [[Nurul Kabir]], editor of the competing daily, ''New Age,'' said, "I have serious disagreement with the editorial policy of Mahmudur Rahman and the most of the contents that his paper ''Amar Desh'' disseminates, but I have no doubt that the government has arrested him primarily because of his active support for the opposition political camps. In a democratic dispensation, this is unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Burke |date=16 April 2013 |title=Bangladesh simmers as Islamic conservatives and progressives clash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/16/bangladesh-hefazat-e-islam-women |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a Dhaka court accepted charges against 41 opposition politicians related to protests, BNP committee member MK Anwar spoke before a rally at the National Press Club. He said, "There's no peace in people's minds. Opposition leaders and workers are subjected to extreme torture. Now they (the Awami League government) have launched coercive acts against mass media. This government can't tolerate its opponents' views.

After more than a month of confinement, 15 editors signed a joint statement that demanded the release of Rahman, dismissal of cases against Rahman's mother and ''Daily Sangram'' for printing ''Amar Desh'' after Rahman's arrest, and an end to the ban on ''Amar Desh's'' publication, as well as similar bans from 5 May on broadcasters Diganta and Islamic TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 May 2013 |title=15 editors concerned |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/15-editors-concerned/ |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manilkara bidentata MHNT.BOT.2010.6.32.jpg|thumb|''Manilkara bidentata'' - [[MHNT]]]]

'''''Manilkara bidentata''''' is a species of ''[[Manilkara]]'' native to a large area of northern [[South America]], [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]].  Common names include '''bulletwood''',&lt;ref&gt;{{PLANTS|id=MABI5|taxon=Manilkara bidentata|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''balatá''', '''ausubo''', '''massaranduba''', and (ambiguously) "[[Cow-tree (disambiguation)|cow-tree]]".

Balatá is a large [[tree]], growing to {{convert|30–45|m|abbr=on}} tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, elliptical, entire, and {{convert|10–20|cm|abbr=on}} long. The [[flower]]s are white, and are produced at the beginning of the rainy season. The [[fruit]] is a yellow [[Berry (botany)|berry]], {{convert|3–5|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, which is edible; it contains one (occasionally two) [[seed]](s). Its [[latex]] is used industrially for products such as [[chicle]].

==Uses==
[[File:Logging Bulletwood Berbice-Guyana JK.JPG|thumb|left|Harvesting bulletwood in [[Guyana]]]]
[[File:Tropenmuseum Royal Tropical Institute Objectnumber 1336-6 Zweep van balata.jpg|thumb|A whip handle of balatá, made before 1939]]

The [[latex]] is extracted in the same manner in which sap is extracted from the [[rubber tree]]. It is then dried to form an [[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]] rubber-like material. It is almost identical to [[gutta-percha]] (produced from a closely related [[southeast Asia]]n tree), and is sometimes called ''gutta-balatá''.

Balatá was often used in the production of high-quality [[golf ball]]s, to use as the outer layer of the ball. Balatá-covered balls have a high spin rate, but do not travel as far as most balls with a [[Surlyn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Surlyn/en_US/|title=Ionomer Resin- DuPont™ Surlyn® - DuPont USA|website=2.dupont.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover. Due to the nondurable nature of the material the golf club strikes, balatá-covered balls do not last long before needing to be replaced. While once favored by professional and low-handicap players, they are now obsolete, replaced by newer Surlyn and [[polyurethane|urethane]] technology.

Today, Brazil is the largest producer of Massaranduba wood, where it is cut in the Amazon rainforest.

The tree is a [[hardwood]] with a red heart, which is used for [[furniture]] and as a [[construction]] material where it grows. Locals often refer to it as '''bulletwood''' for its extremely hard wood, which is so dense that it does not float in water. Drilling is necessary to drive nailed connections. In trade, it is occasionally (and incorrectly) called "[[brazilwood]]".

The fruit, like that of the related sapodilla (''[[Manilkara zapota|M. zapota]]''), is edible.

Though its [[heartwood]] may present in a shade of purple, ''Manilkara bidentata'' should not be confused with another tropical tree widely known as "purpleheart", ''[[Peltogyne]] pubescens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simonandshock.com/lumber.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106165409/http://www.simonandshock.com/lumber.htm |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This timber is being used to produce outdoor furniture and is being marketed as "Pacific Jarrah" in Australia.

A '''mass balance''', also called a '''material balance''', is an application of [[conservation of mass]] to the analysis of physical systems. By accounting for material entering and leaving a system, [[mass flow]]s can be identified which might have been unknown, or difficult to measure without this technique.  The exact [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]] used in the analysis of the system depends on the context of the problem, but all revolve around mass conservation, i.e. that [[matter]] cannot disappear or be created spontaneously.&lt;ref name="himmelblau"&gt;{{cite book | last = Himmelblau | first = David M. | title = Basic Principles and Calculations in Chemical Engineering | edition = 2nd | date = 1967 | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | url = http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Basic-Principles-and-Calculations-in-Chemical-Engineering/9780132346603.page}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–62}}

Therefore, mass balances are used widely in [[engineering]] and [[Environmental analysis|environmental analyses]]. For example, mass balance theory is used to design [[chemical reactor]]s, to analyse alternative processes to produce chemicals, as well as to model [[pollution]] dispersion and other processes of physical systems. Closely related and complementary analysis techniques include the [[population balance equation|population balance]], [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] and the somewhat more complex [[entropy]] balance. These techniques are required for thorough design and analysis of systems such as the [[refrigeration cycle]].

In environmental monitoring the term '''budget calculations''' is used to describe mass balance equations where they are used to evaluate the monitoring data (comparing input and output, etc.) In biology the [[dynamic energy budget]] theory for metabolic organisation makes explicit use of mass and energy balance.

==Introduction==

The general form quoted for a mass balance is ''The mass that enters a system must, by conservation of mass, either leave the system or accumulate within the system ''.

Mathematically the mass balance for a system without a chemical reaction is as follows:&lt;ref name="himmelblau"/&gt;{{rp|59–62}}

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Input} = \mathrm{Output} + \mathrm{Accumulation} \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Strictly speaking the above equation holds also for systems with [[chemical reaction]]s if the terms in the balance equation are taken to refer to total mass, i.e. the sum of all the chemical species of the system. In the absence of a chemical reaction the amount of any chemical species flowing in and out will be the same; this gives rise to an equation for each species present in the system. However, if this is not the case then the mass balance equation must be amended to allow for the generation or depletion (consumption) of each chemical species. Some use one term in this equation to account for chemical reactions, which will be negative for depletion and positive for generation. However, the conventional form of this equation is written to account for both a positive generation term (i.e. product of reaction) and a negative consumption term (the reactants used to produce the products). Although overall one term will account for the total balance on the system, if this balance equation is to be applied to an individual species and then the entire process, both terms are necessary. This modified equation can be used not only for reactive systems, but for population balances such as arise in [[particle mechanics]] problems. The equation is given below; note that it simplifies to the earlier equation in the case that the generation term is zero.&lt;ref name="himmelblau"/&gt;{{rp|59–62}}

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \text{Input} + \text{Generation} = \text{Output} + \text{Accumulation} \ + \text{Consumption} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

*In the absence of a [[nuclear reaction]] the number of [[atoms]] flowing in and out must remain the same, even in the presence of a chemical reaction.
*For a balance to be formed, the boundaries of the system must be clearly defined. &lt;!-- this statement is unclear, but it means to say you must have a good knowledge of where the inlets and outlets to your system are --&gt;
*Mass balances can be taken over physical systems at multiple scales. &lt;!-- Needs an example which the reader can relate to. I tried the idea of a watercourse having a balance at the river level as well as in the water cycle, but it seemed to ill-defined --&gt;
*Mass balances can be simplified with the assumption of [[steady state]], in which the accumulation term is zero.

==Illustrative example==
[[File:mass bal clarifier.svg|thumb|350px|right|Diagram showing clarifier example]]
A simple example can illustrate the concept. Consider the situation in which a [[slurry]] is flowing into a [[settling tank]] to remove the solids in the tank. Solids are collected at the bottom by means of a [[conveyor belt]] partially submerged in the tank, and water exits via an overflow outlet.

In this example, there are two substances: solids and water. The water overflow outlet carries an increased concentration of water relative to solids, as compared to the slurry inlet, and the exit of the conveyor belt carries an increased concentration of solids relative to water.

'''Assumptions'''
*Steady state
*Non-reactive system

'''Analysis'''

Suppose that the slurry inlet composition (by mass) is 50% solid and 50% water, with a mass flow of {{val|100|ul=kg|upl=min}}. The tank is assumed to be operating at steady state, and as such accumulation is zero, so input and output must be equal for both the solids and water. If we know that the removal efficiency for the slurry tank is 60%, then the water outlet will contain {{val|20|ul=kg|upl=min}} of solids (40% times {{val|100|ul=kg|upl=min}} times 50% solids). If we measure the flow rate of the combined solids and water, and the water outlet is shown to be {{val|65|ul=kg|upl=min}}, then the amount of water exiting via the conveyor belt must be {{val|5|ul=kg|upl=min}}. This allows us to completely determine how the mass has been distributed in the system with only limited information and using the mass balance relations across the system boundaries.

==Mass feedback (recycle)==
[[File:CoolingTower.png|frame|right|256px|Cooling towers are a good example of a recycle system]]
Mass balances can be performed across systems which have cyclic flows. In these systems output streams are fed back into the input of a unit, often for further reprocessing.&lt;ref name="himmelblau" /&gt;{{rp|97–105}}

Such systems are common in [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] circuits, where grain is crushed then sieved to only allow fine particles out of the circuit and the larger particles are returned to the roller mill (grinder). However, recycle flows are by no means restricted to solid mechanics operations; they are used in liquid and gas flows, as well. One such example is in [[cooling tower]]s, where water is pumped through a tower many times, with only a small quantity of water drawn off at each pass (to prevent solids build up) until it has either evaporated or exited with the drawn off water.

&lt;!-- Insert generic derivation of mass flow around a recycle with a recyc ratio of R, defined as returned flow/outlet flow--&gt;
The use of the recycle aids in increasing overall conversion of input products, which is useful for low per-pass conversion processes (such as the [[Haber process]]).

==Differential mass balances==

A mass balance can also be taken [[Calculus|differentially]]. The concept is the same as for a large mass balance, but it is performed in the context of a limiting system (for example, one can consider the limiting case in time or, more commonly, volume). A differential mass balance is used to generate [[differential equation]]s that can provide an effective tool for modelling and understanding the target system.

The differential mass balance is usually solved in two steps: first, a set of governing differential equations must be obtained, and then these equations must be solved, either analytically or, for less tractable problems, numerically.

The following systems are good examples of the applications of the differential mass balance:

# Ideal (stirred) Batch reactor
# Ideal tank reactor, also named [[Continuous stirred-tank reactor|Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor]] (CSTR)
# Ideal [[Plug flow reactor model|Plug Flow Reactor]] (PFR)

===Ideal batch reactor===
The ideal completely mixed batch reactor is a closed system. [[Isothermal process|Isothermal conditions]] are assumed, and mixing prevents concentration gradients as reactant concentrations decrease and product concentrations increase over time.&lt;ref name="weber"&gt;{{cite book | last = Weber | first = Walter J., Jr. | title = Physicochemical Processes for Water Quality Control | date = 1972 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley-Interscience]] | isbn = 0-471-92435-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–41}}  Many chemistry textbooks implicitly assume that the studied system can be described as a batch reactor when they write about reaction kinetics and [[chemical equilibrium]].
The mass balance for a substance A becomes

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{IN} + \mathrm{PROD} = \mathrm{OUT} + \mathrm{ACC} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; 0  +  r_{\mathrm{A}}  V = 0 + \frac{dn_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the rate at which substance A is produced, V is the volume (which may be constant or not), ''n''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; the number of moles (''n'') of substance A.

In a fed-batch reactor some reactants/ingredients are added continuously or in pulses (compare making porridge by either first blending all ingredients and then letting it boil, which can be described as a batch reactor, or by first mixing only water and salt and making that boil before the other ingredients are added, which can be described as a fed-batch reactor). Mass balances for fed-batch reactors become a bit more complicated.

====Reactive example====
In the first example, we will show how to use a mass balance to derive a relationship between the [[Air–fuel ratio|percent excess air]] for the [[combustion]] of a hydrocarbon-base fuel oil and the percent oxygen in the combustion product gas. First, normal dry air contains {{val|0.2095|ul=mol}} of oxygen per mole of air, so there is one mole of {{chem|O|2}} in {{val|4.773|u=mol}} of dry air. For stoichiometric combustion, the relationships between the mass of air and the mass of each combustible element in a fuel oil are:

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{Carbon: } \frac {\text{mass of air}}{\text{mass of  C}} = \frac {4.773 \times 28.96} {12.01} = 11.51&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{Hydrogen: } \frac {\text{mass of air}}{\text{mass of H}} = \frac {\frac {1}{4} (4.773) \times 28.96} {1.008} = 34.28&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\text{Sulfur: } \frac {\text{mass of air}}{\text{mass of S}} = \frac {4.773 \times 28.96} {32.06} = 4.31&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Considering the accuracy of typical analytical procedures, an equation for the mass of air per mass of fuel at stoichiometric combustion is:
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {\mathrm{mass \ of \ air}}{\mathrm{mass \ of \ fuel}} = AFR_{mass} = 11.5(wC) + 34.3(wH) + (wS - wO)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
where wC, wH, wS, and wO refer to the mass fraction of each element in the fuel oil, sulfur burning to SO2, and AFR&lt;sub&gt;mass&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the [[air-fuel ratio]] in mass units.

For {{val|1|ul=kg}} of fuel oil containing 86.1% C, 13.6% H, 0.2% O, and 0.1% S the stoichiometric mass of air is {{val|14.56|u=kg}}, so AFR = 14.56. The combustion product mass is then {{val|15.56|u=kg}}. At exact stoichiometry, {{chem|O|2}} should be absent. At 15 percent excess air, the AFR = 16.75, and the mass of the combustion product gas is {{val|17.75|u=kg}}, which contains {{val|0.505|u=kg}} of excess oxygen. The combustion gas thus contains 2.84 percent {{chem|O|2}} by mass. The relationships between percent excess air and %{{chem|O|2}} in the combustion gas are accurately expressed by quadratic equations, valid over the range 0–30 percent excess air:

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\% \ excess \ air} = 1.2804 \times (\mathrm{\%O_2 \ in \ combustion \ gas})^2 + 4.49 \times (\mathrm{\%O_2 \ in \ combustion \ gas})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\%O_2 \ in \ combustion \ gas} = -0.00138 \times (\mathrm{\% \ excess \ air})^2 + 0.210 \times (\mathrm{\% \ excess \ air})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the second example we will use the law of [[Law of mass action|mass action]] to '''derive''' the expression for a [[chemical equilibrium]] constant.

Assume we have a closed reactor in which the following liquid phase reversible reaction occurs:

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; a\mathrm{A} + b\mathrm{B} \leftrightarrow c\mathrm{C} + d\mathrm{D} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The mass balance for substance A becomes

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{IN} + \mathrm{PROD} = \mathrm{OUT} + \mathrm{ACC} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; 0  +  r_{\mathrm{A}}  V = 0 + \frac{dn_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As we have a liquid phase reaction we can (usually) assume a constant volume and since &lt;math&gt; n_{\mathrm{A}}= V * C_{\mathrm{A}} &lt;/math&gt; we get

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; r_{\mathrm{A}}  V = V \frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

or

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; r_{\mathrm{A}}  = \frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In many text books this is given as the definition of [[reaction rate]] without specifying the implicit assumption that we are talking about reaction rate in a closed system with only one reaction. This is an unfortunate mistake that has confused many students over the years.

According to the [[law of mass action]] the forward reaction rate can be written as

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; r_1=k_1 [\mathrm{A}]^a[\mathrm{B}]^b &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

and the backward reaction rate as

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; r_{-1}=k_{-1}1 [\mathrm{C}]^c[\mathrm{D}]^d &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The rate at which substance A is produced is thus

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; r_{\mathrm{A}} = a ( r_{-1} - r_1 ) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

and since, at equilibrium, the concentration of A is constant we get

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; r_{\mathrm{A}} = a ( r_{-1} - r_1 ) = \frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} =0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

or, rearranged

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}=\frac{[\mathrm{C}]^c[\mathrm{D}]^d}{[\mathrm{A}]^a[\mathrm{B}]^b}=K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

===Ideal tank reactor/continuously stirred tank reactor===
{{main article|Continuous stirred-tank reactor}}
The continuously mixed tank reactor is an open system with an influent stream of reactants and an effluent stream of products.&lt;ref name="weber" /&gt;{{rp|41}}  A lake can be regarded as a tank reactor, and lakes with long turnover times (e.g. with low flux-to-volume ratios) can for many purposes be regarded as continuously stirred (e.g. homogeneous in all respects). The mass balance then becomes

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{IN} + \mathrm{PROD} = \mathrm{OUT} + \mathrm{ACC} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q_0\cdot C_{\mathrm{A},0} + r_{\rm A}\cdot V = Q\cdot C_{\mathrm{A}} + \frac{dn_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

where ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and Q denote the volumetric flow in and out of the system respectively and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;A,0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; the concentration of A in the inflow and outflow respective. In an open system we can never reach a chemical equilibrium. We can, however, reach a [[dynamic equilibrium|steady state]] where all '''state variables''' (temperature, concentrations etc.) remain constant (&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ACC} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;).

====Example====
Consider a bathtub in which there is some bathing salt dissolved. We now fill in more water, keeping the bottom plug in. What happens?

Since there is no reaction, &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{PROD} =0&lt;/math&gt; and since there is no outflow &lt;math&gt; Q=0 &lt;/math&gt;. The mass balance becomes

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{IN} + \mathrm{PROD} = \mathrm{OUT} + \mathrm{ACC} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q_0 \cdot C_{\mathrm{A},0} +0 = 0\cdot C_{\mathrm{A}} + \frac{dn_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

or

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; Q_0\cdot C_{\mathrm{A},0}= \frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}V}{dt}=V \frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} + C_{\mathrm{A}}\frac{dV}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using a mass balance for total volume, however, it is evident that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dt}=Q_0&lt;/math&gt;and that &lt;math&gt;V=V_{t=0}+Q_0t&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we get

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt}=\frac{Q_0}{(V_{t=0}+Q_0t)}\left( C_{\mathrm{A},0}-C_{\mathrm{A}} \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Note that there is no reaction and hence no [[reaction rate]] or [[rate law]] involved, and yet &lt;math&gt;\frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt}\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. We can thus draw the conclusion that reaction rate can not be defined in a general manner using &lt;math&gt; \frac{dC}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;. One '''must''' first write down a mass balance before a link between &lt;math&gt; \frac{dC}{dt} &lt;/math&gt; and the reaction rate can be found. Many textbooks, however, define reaction rate as

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt;v= \frac{dC_{\mathrm{A}}}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

without mentioning that this definition implicitly assumes that the system is closed, has a constant volume and that there is only one reaction.

===Ideal plug flow reactor (PFR)===
The idealized plug flow reactor is an open system resembling a tube with no mixing in the direction of flow but perfect mixing perpendicular to the direction of flow. Often used for systems like rivers and water pipes if the flow is turbulent. When a mass balance is made for a tube, one first considers an [[infinitesimal]] part of the tube and make a mass balance over that using the ideal tank reactor model.&lt;ref name="weber" /&gt;{{rp|46–47}} That mass balance is then [[integral|integrated]] over the entire reactor volume to obtain:

&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(Q\cdot C_{\rm A})}{dV} = r_{\rm A} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In numeric solutions, e.g. when using computers, the ideal tube is often translated to a series of tank reactors, as it can be shown that a PFR is equivalent to an infinite number of stirred tanks in series, but the latter is often easier to analyze, especially at steady state.

==More complex problems==
In reality, reactors are often non-ideal, in which combinations of the reactor models above are used to describe the system. Not only chemical reaction rates, but also [[mass transfer]] rates may be important in the mathematical description of a system, especially in [[heterogeneous]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = Robert H. | last2 = Chilton | first2 = Cecil H. | last3 = Kirkpatrick | first3 = Sidney D. | title = [[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|Chemical Engineers' Handbook]] | edition = 4th | date = 1963 | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill#McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]] | pages = 4–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the chemical [[reaction rate]] depends on temperature it is often necessary to make both an [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] (often a heat balance rather than a full-fledged energy balance) as well as mass balances to fully describe the system. A different reactor model might be needed for the energy balance: A system that is closed with respect to mass might be open with respect to energy e.g. since heat may enter the system through [[heat conduction|conduction]].

==Commercial use==
In industrial process plants, using the fact that the mass entering and leaving any portion of a process plant must balance, [[data validation and reconciliation]] algorithms may be employed to correct measured flows, provided that enough redundancy of flow measurements exist to permit statistical reconciliation and exclusion of detectably erroneous measurements. Since all real world measured values contain inherent error, the reconciled measurements provide a better basis than the measured values do for financial reporting, optimization, and regulatory reporting. Software packages exist to make this commercially feasible on a daily basis.

'''Metabolic rift''' is  [[Karl Marx| Karl Marx's]] notion of the "irreparable rift in the interdependent process of [[social metabolism]],"&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. 1981. ''Capital, vol. III''. New York: Vintage, p. 949.&lt;/ref&gt;—Marx's key conception of [[ecological crisis]] tendencies under [[capitalism]].  Marx theorized a rupture in the metabolic interaction between humanity and the rest of nature emanating from capitalist production and the growing division between town and country.

Metabolic rift, according to [[John Bellamy Foster]] who coined the term, is the development of Marx's earlier work in the [[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts'']] on [[species-being]] and the relationship between humans and nature. Metabolism is Marx's "mature analysis of the alienation of nature,"&lt;ref&gt;Foster, John Bellamy (2000) [http://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb0122/ ''Marx's Ecology: Materialism and Nature''], New York: Monthly Review Press, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; and presents "a more solid—and scientific—way in which to depict the complex, dynamic interchange between human beings and nature, resulting from human labor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foster | first1 = John Bellamy | year = 1999 | title = 'Marx's Theory of Metabolic Rift: Classical Foundations for Environmental Sociology' | jstor =10.1086/210315 | journal = The American Journal of Sociology | volume = 105 | issue = 2| page = 381 | doi=10.1086/210315| citeseerx = 10.1.1.534.2551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to those who have attributed to Marx a disregard for nature and responsibility for the environmental problems of the [[Soviet Union]] and other purportedly [[communist state]]s, Foster sees in the theory of metabolic rift evidence of Marx's [[Ecology|ecological]] perspective. The theory of metabolic rift "enable[ed] [Marx] to develop a critique of environmental degradation that anticipated much of present-day ecological thought,"&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; including questions of [[sustainability]].

== Origins ==

=== Soil exhaustion and agricultural revolutions ===
Marx's writings on metabolism were developed during England's "second" [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] (1815–1880), a period which was characterized by the development of [[soil chemistry]] and the growth of the use of chemical [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The depletion of [[Fertility (soil)|soil fertility]], or "soil exhaustion," had become a key concern for capitalist society, and demand for fertilizer was such that Britain and other powers initiated explicit policies for the importation of [[Bone meal|bone]] and [[guano]], including raiding of Napoleonic battlefields&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; and catacombs,&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; British monopolization of Peruvian guano supplies,&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the United States, "the imperial annexation of any [[List of Guano Island claims|islands]] thought to be rich in [guano]"  through the [[Guano Islands Act]] (1856).&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clark | first1 = Brett | last2 = Foster | first2 = John Bellamy | year = 2009 | title = 'Ecological Imperialism and the Global Metabolic Rift: Unequal Exchange and the Guano/Nitrates Trade' | url = | journal = International Journal of Comparative Sociology | volume = 50 | issue = 3–4| pages = 311–334 | doi = 10.1177/0020715209105144 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liebig and soil science ===

Marx's theory drew heavily on contemporary advances in agricultural chemistry unknown to earlier classical economists such as [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Malthus|Malthus]]. For them, different levels of soil fertility (and thus [[Economic rent|rent]]) was attributed "almost entirely to the natural or absolute productivity of the soil,"&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt; with improvement (or degradation) playing only a minor role.

German agricultural chemist [[Liebig|Justus von Liebig]], in his [https://books.google.com/books?id=p-IMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Organic+Chemistry+in+its+Application+to+Agriculture+and+Physiology  ''Organic Chemistry in Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology''] (1840), presented the first convincing explanation of the role of soil nutrients in the growth of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; In [https://books.google.com/books?id=90AQAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Organic+Chemistry+in+its+Application+to+Physiology+and+Pathology 1842], Liebig expanded the use of the term [[metabolism]] (''Stoffwechsel''), from referring to material exchanges in the body, up to the biochemical processes of natural systems.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster argues that Liebig's work became more critical of capitalist agriculture as time went on. From the standpoint of nutrient cycling, the socio-economic relationship between rural and urban areas was self-evidently contradictory, hindering the possibility of sustainability:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it were practicable to collect, with the least loss, all the solid and fluid excrements of the inhabitants of the town, and return to each farmer the portion arising from produce originally supplied by him to the town, the productiveness of the land might be maintained almost unimpaired for ages to come, and the existing store of mineral elements in every fertile field would be amply sufficient for the wants of increasing populations.&lt;ref&gt;von Liebig, Justus (1863) ''The Natural Laws of Husbandry'', New York: D. Appleton, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Human labor and nature ===

Marx rooted his theory of social-ecological metabolism in Liebig's analysis but connected it to his understanding of the labor process.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx understood that, throughout history, it was through labor that humans appropriated nature to satisfy their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the metabolism, or interaction, of society with nature is "a universal and perpetual condition."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1996) ''Justice, Nature and the Geography of Difference'', Malden: Blackwell, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'', Marx integrated his [[materialist]] conception of nature with his [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Fertility, Marx argued, was not a natural quality of the soil, but was rather bound up with the social relations of the time. By conceptualizing the complex, interdependent processes of material exchange and regulatory actions that link human society with non-human nature as "metabolic relations," Marx allowed these processes to be both "nature-imposed conditions" and subject to human [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; a dynamic largely missed, according to Foster, by the reduction of ecological questions to [[Ecocentrism|issues of value]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writers since Marx ==

The central contribution of the metabolic rift perspective is to locate socio-ecological contradictions internal to the development of capitalism. Later socialists expanded upon Marx's ideas, including [[Bukharin|Nikolai Bukharin]] in ''Historical Materialism'' (1921) and [[Karl Kautsky]] in ''The Agrarian Question'' (1899), which developed questions of the exploitation of the countryside by the town and the "fertilizer treadmill" that resulted from metabolic rift.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary [[Eco-socialism|eco-socialist]] theorists aside from Foster have also explored these directions, including [[James O'Connor (academic)|James O'Connor]], who sees capitalist undervaluing of nature as leading to economic crisis, what he refers to as 
[[Eco-socialism#The "second contradiction" of capitalism|the second contradiction of capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, James (1997) ''Natural Causes: Essays in Ecological Marxism'', New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from a variety of disciplines have drawn on Marx's metabolic approach and the concept of metabolic rift in analyzing the relation of society to the rest of nature.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://monthlyreview.org/commentary/metabolic-rift Metabolic Rift: A Selected Bibliography]"&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] being released into the environment from capitalist production, the theory of a [[carbon rift]] has also immerged.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Brett, and Richard York. “Carbon Metabolism: Global Capitalism, Climate Change, and the Biospheric Rift.” ''Theory and Society'', vol. 34, no. 4, 2005, pp. 391–428. www.jstor.org/stable/4501730&lt;/ref&gt;

The metabolic rift is characterized in different ways by historical materialists. For [http://www.jasonwmoore.com Jason W. Moore], the distinction between social and natural systems is empirically false and theoretically arbitrary; following a different reading of Marx, Moore views metabolisms as relations of human and extra-human natures. In this view, capitalism's metabolic rift unfolds through the town-country division of labor, itself a "bundle" of relations between humans and the rest of nature. Moore sees it as constitutive of the endless accumulation of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W | year = 2011 | title = Transcending the Metabolic Rift: Towards a Theory of Crises in the Capitalist World-Ecology | url = http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html | journal = Journal of Peasant Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–46 | doi = 10.1080/03066150.2010.538579 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110510142258/http://www.jasonwmoore.com/Essays.html | archivedate = 2011-05-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore's perspective, although also rooted in historical materialism, produces a widely divergent view from that of Foster and others about what makes ecological crisis and how it relates to capital accumulation.

Nine months after Foster's groundbreaking article appeared, Moore argued that the origins of the metabolic rift were not found in the 19th century but in the rise of capitalism during the "long" 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W | year = 2000 | title = Environmental Crises and the Metabolic Rift in World-Historical Perspective | url = | journal = Organization and Environment | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 123–158 | doi=10.1177/1086026600132001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metabolic rift was not a consequence of industrial agriculture but capitalist relations pivoting on the law of value. Moore consequently focuses attention on the grand movements of primitive accumulation, colonialism, and the globalization of town-country relations that characterized early modern capitalism. There were, in this view, not one but many metabolic rifts; every great phase of capitalist development organized nature in new ways, each one with its own metabolic rift. In place of agricultural revolutions, Moore emphasizes recurrent agro-ecological revolutions, assigned the historical task of providing [[cheap food]] and cheap labor, in the history of capitalism, an interpretation that extends the analysis to the food crises of the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W | year = 2010 | title = The End of the Road?

== Environmental contradiction under capitalism ==

=== Town and country ===

Up until the 16th or 17th centuries, cities' metabolic dependency upon surrounding countryside (for resources, etc.), coupled with the technological limitations to production and extraction, prevented extensive urbanization. Early urban centers were [[Ecoregion|bioregionally]] defined, and had relatively light "[[Ecological footprint|footprints]]," recycling city [[nightsoil]]s back into the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, pp. 410-411.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the rise of capitalism, cities expanded in size and population. Large-scale industry required factories, raw material, workers, and large amounts of food. As urban economic security was dependent upon its metabolic support system,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; cities now looked further afield for their resource and waste flows. As spatial barriers were broken down, capitalist society "violated" what were previously "nature-imposed conditions of sustainability."&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, pp. 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

With trade and expansion, food and fiber were shipped longer distances. The nutrients of the soil were sent to cities in the form of agricultural produce, but these same nutrients, in the form of human and animal waste, were not returned to the land. Thus there was a one-way movement, a "robbing of the soil" in order to maintain the socio-economic reproduction of society.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, pp. 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx thus linked the crisis of pollution in cities with the crisis of soil depletion. The rift was a result of the antagonistic separation of town and country, and the social-ecological relations of production created by capitalism were ultimately unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Jason W. | year = 2000 | title = 'Environmental Crises and the Metabolic Rift in World-Historical Perspective' | url = | journal = Organization &amp; Environment | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 123–158 | doi = 10.1177/1086026600132001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''Capital'', volume 1, on "Large-scale Industry and Agriculture":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Capitalist production collects the population together in great centres, and causes the urban population to achieve an ever-growing preponderance. This has two results. On the one hand it concentrates the historical motive force of society; on the other hand, ''it disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth, i.e. it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing; hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil''...But by destroying the circumstances surrounding that metabolism...it compels its systematic restoration as a regulative law of social production, and in a form adequate to the full development of the human race...All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress toward ruining the more long-lasting sources of that fertility...''Capitalist production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth—the soil and the worker''.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1976) ''Capital, vol. I'', New York: Vintage, pp. 637-638. (emphasis added)  Alternate translation: Marx, Karl (1967) ''Capital, vol. I'', New York: International Publishers Co., Inc., pp. 505-506, http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch15.htm#S10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The future socialist society ===

The concept of metabolic rift captures "the material [[Marx's theory of alienation|estrangement]] of human beings within capitalist society from the natural conditions which formed the basis for their existence."&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Marx also emphasizes the importance of historical change. It was both necessary and possible to rationally govern human metabolism with nature, but this was something "completely beyond the capabilities of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society."&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; In a future [[Free Association of producers|society of freely associated producers]], however, humans could govern their relations with nature via collective control, rather than through the blind power of market relations.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Capital, Volume III|''Capital'', volume 3]], Marx states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Freedom, in this sphere...can consist only in this, that socialized man, the associated producers, govern the human metabolism with nature in a rational way, bringing it under their own collective control rather than being dominated by it as a blind power; accomplishing it with the least expenditure of energy and in conditions most worthy and appropriate for their human nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marx 1981, p. 959.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But Marx did not argue that a sustainable relation to the earth was an automatic result of the transition to [[socialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1999, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, there was a need for planning and measures to address the division of labor and population between town and country and for the restoration and improvement of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl, and Engels, Friedrich (1967) ''The Communist Manifesto'', New York: Monthly Review Press, pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metabolism and environmental governance ==

Despite Marx's assertion that a concept of ecological sustainability was "of very limited practical relevance to capitalist society," as it was incapable of applying rational scientific methods and social planning due to the pressures of competition,&lt;ref&gt;Foster 2000, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; the theory of metabolic rift may be seen as relevant to, if not explicitly invoked in, many contemporary debates and policy directions of [[environmental governance]].

There is a rapidly growing body of literature on social-ecological metabolism. While originally limited to questions of soil fertility—essentially a critique of capitalist agriculture—the concept of metabolic rift has since been taken up in numerous fields and its scope expanded. For example, Clausen and Clark (2005) have extended the use of metabolic rift to [[marine ecology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clausen | first1 = Rebecca | last2 = Clark | first2 = Brett | year = 2005 | title = 'The Metabolic Rift and Marine Ecology: An Analysis of the Ocean Crisis Within Capitalist Production Organization &amp; Environment' | url = | journal = Organization and Environment | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 422–444 | doi = 10.1177/1086026605281187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Moore (2000) uses the concept to discuss the broader concerns of global environmental crises and the viability of capitalism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Moore 2000, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer-Kowalski (1998) discusses the application of "the biological concept of metabolism to social systems," tracing it through several contributing scientific traditions, including [[biology]], ecology, [[social theory]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[social geography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer-Kowalski | first1 = Marina | year = 1998 | title = 'Society's Metabolism: The Intellectual History of Materials Flow Analysis, Part I, 1860–1970' | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 61–78 | doi=10.1162/jiec.1998.2.1.61}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[social metabolism]] approach has become "one of the most important paradigms for the empirical analysis of the society-nature-interaction across various disciplines,"&lt;ref&gt;Fischer-Kowalski 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in the fields of [[industrial metabolism]] and [[material flow analysis]].

=== Urban political ecology ===

[[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] points out that much of the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] has held (and in some areas continues to hold) a profound anti-urban sentiment, seeing cities as "the highpoint of plundering and pollution of all that is good and holy on planet earth."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is that such a perspective focuses solely on a particular form of nature, ignoring many people's lived experience of the environment and the importance of cities in ecological processes and as ecological sites in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Erik Swyngedouw]] and other theorists have conceptualized the city as an ecological space through urban [[political ecology]], which connects material flows within cities and between the urban and non-urban.

=== Sustainable cities ===

In city planning policy circles, there has been a recent movement toward [[urban sustainability]]. Hodson and Marvin discuss a "new eco-urbanism" that seeks to integrate environment and infrastructure, "bundling" [[architecture]], ecology and technology in order to "internalize" energy, water, food, waste and other material flows.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson, Mike and Marvin, Simon (2010) 'Eco-urbanism: Transcendent Eco-Cities or Urban Ecological Security?', in: Mostafavi, M. and Doherty, G. (eds)  ''Ecological Urbanism'', Cambridge: Lars Muller Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous efforts to integrate nature into the city, which, according to Harvey, were primarily aesthetic and bourgeois in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; these new efforts are taking place in the context of climate change, resource constraints and the threat of environmental crises.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson &amp; Marvin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the traditional approach of capitalist urbanization, which sought more and more distant sources for material resources and waste sinks (as seen in the [[California Water Wars|history of Los Angeles water]]), eco-urban sites would re-internalize their own resources and re-circulate wastes. The goal is [[autarky]] and greater ecological and infrastructural self-reliance through "[[Closed ecological system|closed-loop systems]]" that reduce reliance on external networks.&lt;ref&gt;Hodson &amp; Marvin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although difficult given the reliance on international supply chains, urban food movements are working to reduce the commodification of food and individual and social forms of alienation from food within cities.&lt;ref&gt;Sbicca, Joshua (2014). 'The Need to Feed: Urban Metabolic Struggles of Actually Existing Radical Projects.' Critical Sociology. 40(3): 817–834.&lt;/ref&gt; This takes place within actually existing conditions of neoliberalization, suggesting that healing metabolic rifts will be a process that requires both social and ecological transformations. 

However, critics link these efforts to "managerial environmentalism,"&lt;ref&gt;Harvey 1996, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; and worry that eco-urbanism too closely falls into an "urban ecological security" approach,&lt;ref&gt;Hodson &amp; Marvin 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; echoing [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]]' analysis of [[Securitization (international relations)|securitization]] and fortress urbanism. A Marxist critique might also question the feasibility of sustainable cities within the context of a global capitalist system.

According to the [[CBC News|CBC]], Hughes collapsed after the landing and it took Hughes three days to recover.

===Flat-Earth rocket fundraising and launch===
In 2016 Hughes launched a failed fundraising attempt for a rocket that earned only $310.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt;&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; After professing his belief in a flat Earth later that year, Hughes gained support within the [[Modern flat Earth societies|flat-Earth community]]. His post-flat-Earth fundraising campaign made its $7,875 goal. He has said he intends to make multiple rocket journeys, culminating in a flight to outer space, where he believes he will be able to take a picture of the entire Earth as a flat disk.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; He claimed in November 2017 that the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) had given him verbal permission more than a year ago to launch his rocket, pending approval from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]; however, a BLM spokesman said its local field office had no record of speaking to Hughes at the time. According to the BLM, after seeing some news articles about the planned launch, a BLM representative reached out to Hughes with concerns. The rocket launch was originally scheduled for the weekend of November 25, 2017; Hughes then rescheduled for December 2, 2017, blaming ongoing difficulties in obtaining permissions.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; Hughes moved his launch pad {{convert|4|mi|km}} so that he could take off and land on private property; however, the BLM maintained he still needed to fill out permits. Hughes defiantly stated the dispute would not stop him flying: "I'm a daredevil. I'm not much for authority or rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Self-taught rocket scientist eyes new launch date in Calif.|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/self-taught-rocket-scientist-eyes-new-launch-date-in-calif/|accessdate=29 November 2017|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The untested initial rocket was intended to reach a speed of {{convert|500|mph|km/h}}; further rocket trips, to be launched from a balloon {{convert|20|mi|km}} up,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dow|first1=Mike|title='Mad' Mike Hughes – limo driver turned rocket man|url=http://www.themaineedge.com/adventure/mad-mike-hughes-%E2%80%93-limo-driver-turned-rocket-man|accessdate=10 January 2018|work=[[The Maine Edge]]|date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are intended to reach above the atmosphere into outer space. Hughes acknowledged there are risks, telling the Associated Press: "It's scary as hell. But none of us are getting out of this world alive."&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; A fundraising campaign to cover the costs of the delay raised only around $100 of its $10,000 goal. On February 3, 2018, Hughes live-streamed another attempted to launch in front of spectators, but the rocket failed to ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Selk|first1=Avi|last2=Wang|first2=Amy B.|title=Analysis {{!}} A flat-earther finally tried to fly away. His rocket didn’t even ignite.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/02/06/a-flat-earther-finally-tried-to-fly-away-his-rocket-didnt-even-ignite/|accessdate=7 February 2018|work=Washington Post|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful launch on March 24, 2018, resulted in his reaching a height of {{convert|1875|ft|m}} and a [[hard landing]] in the Mojave Desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/flat-earther-mad-mike-hughes-rocket-launch-man-blasts-off-a8272761.html|title=Flat-earther blasts off in homemade rocket in bid to reassure himself world is shaped 'like a Frisbee'|date=25 March 2018|author=Chiara Giordano|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steam-powered rocket launched at a sharp angle to avoid falling back to Earth on public land, and landed about {{convert|1500|ft|m}} away from the launch point. Hughes' team reported a maximum speed of 350 mph. Hughes reported no serious injury from the landing.&lt;ref name="ap via latimes"/&gt;

Ian Whittaker of [[Nottingham Trent University]] has commented that a more feasible way to view the shape of the Earth is to send up a camera in a [[high-altitude balloon]]; if high up enough in the atmosphere, such a camera can see the curvature of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why you don't need a rocket to prove the planet is round|url=http://www.newsweek.com/flat-earth-society-mike-hughes-rocket-proof-planet-round-724207|accessdate=30 November 2017|work=Newsweek|date=28 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nymph''' ({{lang-el|νύμφη}}, ''nýmphē'' {{IPA-el|nýmpʰɛː|}}) in [[Greek mythology]] is a minor female [[nature deity]] typically associated with a particular location or landform.

Different from other [[goddess]]es, nymphs are generally regarded as divine spirits who animate nature, and are usually depicted as beautiful, young [[nubile]] maidens who love to dance and sing; their amorous freedom sets them apart from the restricted and [[chaste]] wives and daughters of the Greek ''[[polis]]''. They are beloved by many and dwell in mountainous regions and forests by springs or rivers; as [[Walter Burkert]] (Burkert 1985:III.3.3) remarks, "The idea that rivers are gods and springs divine nymphs is deeply rooted not only in poetry but in belief and ritual; the worship of these deities is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality."
Other nymphs, always in the shape of young maidens, were part of the [[retinue]] of a god, such as [[Dionysus]], [[Hermes]], or [[Pan (god)|Pan]], or a goddess, generally the huntress [[Artemis]].&lt;ref&gt;But see Jennifer Larson, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3298110 "Handmaidens of Artemis?"], ''The Classical Journal'' '''92'''.3 (February 1997), pp. 249–257.&lt;/ref&gt; Nymphs were the frequent target of [[satyr]]s.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|νύμφη}}
The [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|νύμφη}} has the primary meaning of "nubile young woman; bride, young wife" and is not associated with deities in particular. It refers to young women at the peak of sexual attractiveness, contrasting with ''parthenos'' ({{lang|grc|παρθένος}}) "a virgin (of any age)", and generic ''[[Kore (sculpture)|kore]]'' ({{lang|grc|κόρη}} &lt; {{lang|grc|κόρϝα}}) "maiden, girl". The term is used by (human) women to address each other, so Iris addressing Helen, or Eurycleia addressing Penelope as {{lang|grc|νύμφα φίλη}} "dear ''nymph''" (''Il.'' 3.130, ''Od.'' 4.743). Reduced to {{lang|el|[[:wikt:νύφη|νύφη]]}}, the word remains the regular [[Modern Greek]] term for "[[bride]]". In [[Katharevousa]], it is still {{lang|grc|νύμφη}}, as in the [[Responsory|refrain]] of the [[Marian hymn]] ''[[O Virgin Pure|Agni Parthene]]'' (c. 1880), {{lang|grc|χαῖρε νύμφη ἀνύμφευτε}} "hail, unwedded bride".&lt;ref&gt;first published in Θεοτοκάριον μικρόν, Athens (1905).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Doric Greek|Doric]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] ([[Homeric Greek|Homeric]]) form is {{lang|grc|νύμφα}}. The ''[[Iliad]]'' (6.420) refers to "mountain nymphs, maidens of Zeus":
:{{lang|grc|ἠδ᾽ ἐπὶ σῆμ᾽ ἔχεεν: περὶ δὲ πτελέας ἐφύτευσαν / νύμφαι ὀρεστιάδες κοῦραι Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο.}} [''Il.'' 6.419f.]
:"He &amp;#x5b;[[Achilles]]&amp;#x5d; heaped over him &amp;#x5b;[[Eetion]]&amp;#x5d; a barrow, and all about were elm-trees planted / by mountain-nymphs, maidens of Zeus the aegis-bearer."
{{Greek myth (nymph)}}

The divine nymphs are called θεαὶ Νύμφαι "the nubile goddesses" in ''Il.'' 24.616. In [[mystery cult|mystical theology]], the term is applied to souls seeking re-birth. The derived verb {{lang|grc|νυμφεύω}} means "to marry (of a woman)" (with dative), "to give in marriage (of the bride's father)" or "to marry (of the husband)" (with accusative).

The etymology of the noun {{lang|grc|νύμφη}} is not certain. It has been compared to [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|nubere}}'' "to wed", as derived from a word for "veil, cover", root cognate with Greek νέφος, Latin ''nubes'' ("cloud"), Greek νεφέλη, Latin ''nebula'' ("mist, vapor"), and Latin ''nimbus'' ("cloud cover"). This is not generally accepted. Beekes argues for a [[pre-Greek]] origin of the word.{{cn|date=July 2018}} An alternative suggestion{{by whom|date=July 2018}} connects a word for "to bud, swell", from the root of German ''{{lang|de|Knospe}}'') "bud".{{cn|date=July 2018}}&lt;!--highly dubious, the Germanic is from *knup-, where is the initial *k- ?--&gt; This is informed by a gloss of [[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] which gives "rose-bud" as a meaning of {{lang|grc|νύμφη}}.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Ancient Greek mythology==
The Greek nymphs were spirits invariably bound to places, not unlike the Latin ''[[genius loci]]'', and the difficulty of transferring their cult may be seen in the complicated myth that brought [[Arethusa (mythology)|Arethusa]] to Sicily. In the works of the Greek-educated [[Latin literature|Latin poets]], the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams ([[Juturna]], [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]], [[Carmentis]], [[Fontus]]), while the [[Lympha]]e (originally Lumpae), Italian water-goddesses, owing to the accidental similarity of their names, could be identified with the Greek Nymphae. The mythologies of classicizing Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cult of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of [[Latium]]. Among the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] literate class, their sphere of influence was restricted, and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element.

==Greek folk religion==
The ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century, when they were usually known as "[[nereids]]". At that time, John Cuthbert Lawson wrote: "...there is probably no nook or hamlet in all Greece where the womenfolk at least do not scrupulously take precautions against the thefts and malice of the nereids, while many a man may still be found to recount in all good faith stories of their beauty, passion and caprice.

"Nor is it a matter of faith only; more than once I have been in villages where certain Nereids were known by sight to several persons (so at least they averred); and there was a wonderful agreement among the witnesses in the description of their appearance and dress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawson |first=John Cuthbert |title=Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion |edition=1st |year=1910 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nymphs tended to frequent areas distant from humans but could be encountered by lone travelers outside the village, where their music might be heard, and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool, either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night. They might appear in a whirlwind. Such encounters could be dangerous, bringing dumbness, besotted infatuation, madness or stroke to the unfortunate human. When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck, they would pray to Saint Artemidos.&lt;ref&gt;"heathen Artemis yielded her functions to her own genitive case transformed into Saint Artemidos", as [[Terrot Reaveley Glover]] phrased it in discussing the "practical polytheism in the worship of the saints", in ''Progress in Religion to the Christian Era''

==Modern reception==
===Sleeping nymph===
A motif that entered European art during the [[Renaissance]] was the idea of a statue of a nymph sleeping in a [[grotto]] or spring.&lt;ref name="National Gallery of Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nymph of the Spring|url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.43716.html|website=National Gallery of Art|accessdate=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen John Campbell|title=The Cabinet of Eros: Renaissance Mythological Painting and the Studiolo of Isabella D'Este|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_GBq346SKIC&amp;pg=PA95|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-11753-0|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AinsworthWaterman2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maryan Wynn Ainsworth|author2=Joshua P.

Levenson|author2=National Gallery of Art (U.S.)|title=Circa 1492: Art in the Age of Exploration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMK-Ba0-RG4C&amp;pg=PA260|year=1991|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-05167-4|pages=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, and an accompanying poem supposedly on the fountain describing the sleeping nymph, are now generally concluded to be a fifteenth-century forgery, but the motif proved influential among artists and landscape gardeners for several centuries after, with copies seen at neoclassical gardens such as the grotto at [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref name="Barkan1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonard Barkan|title=Unearthing the Past: Archaeology and Aesthetics in the Making of Renaissance Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMHJVKLc74C&amp;pg=PA237|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-08911-0|pages=237–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacDougall1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elisabeth B.

===Sexual connotations===
Due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women freely and without care, the term is often related to women who are perceived as behaving similarly. (For example, the title of the [[Perry Mason]] detective novel ''The Case of the Negligent Nymph'' (1956) by [[Erle Stanley Gardner]] is derived from this meaning of the word.){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The term ''[[nymphomania]]'' was created by modern [[psychology]] as referring to a "desire to engage in [[human sexual behavior]] at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant", ''nymphomaniac'' being the person suffering from such a disorder. Due to widespread use of the term among lay persons (often shortened to ''nympho'') and stereotypes attached, professionals nowadays prefer the term ''[[hypersexuality]]'', which can refer to males and females alike.

The word ''[[nymphet]]'' is used to identify a sexually precocious girl. The term was made famous in the novel ''[[Lolita]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]]. The main character, [[Humbert Humbert]], uses the term many times, usually in reference to the title character.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==List==
{{refimprove|date=July 2018}}
As [[H.J. Rose]] states, all the names for various classes of nymphs are plural feminine adjectives agreeing with the substantive ''nymphai'', and there was no single classification that could be seen as canonical and exhaustive. Thus, the classes of nymphs tend to overlap, which complicates the task of precise classification.

Rose mentions [[dryad]]s and [[hamadryad]]s as nymphs of trees generally, ''[[meliai]]'' as nymphs of [[ash tree]]s, and [[naiad]]s as nymphs of water, but no others specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rose |first=Herbert Jennings |authorlink=H.

'''Philip Carteret, [[Lord|Seigneur]] of [[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]]''' (22 January 1733, [[Trinity Manor]], [[Jersey]] – 21 July 1796, [[Southampton]]) was a [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval officer and [[List of explorers|explorer]] who participated in two of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[circumnavigation]] expeditions in 1764–66 and 1766–69.

==Biography==
Carteret entered the navy in 1747, serving aboard the {{HMS|Salisbury|1746|2}}, and then under Captain [[John Byron]] from 1751 to 1755. Between 1757 and 1758 he was in the {{HMS|Guernsey|1696|2}} on the [[Mediterranean Station]]. As a lieutenant in the {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}} he accompanied Byron during his voyage of circumnavigation, from June 1764 to May 1766.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |title=Carteret, Philip, Rear-Admiral 
 |work=[[National Maritime Museum]]
 |accessdate=16 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1766 he was made a commander and given the command of the {{HMS|Swallow|1766|2}} to circumnavigate the world, as consort to the {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|2}} under the command of [[Samuel Wallis]]. The two ships were parted shortly after sailing through the [[Strait of Magellan]], Carteret discovering [[Pitcairn Island]] and the [[Carteret Islands]], which were subsequently named after him. In 1767, he also discovered a new archipelago inside [[Saint George's Channel]] between [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[New Britain]] Islands ([[Papua New Guinea]]) and named it [[Duke of York Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], vol. 4, p.263: ''"[[Duke of York Islands]]"''. Chicago, 1989. {{ISBN|0-85229-493-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as rediscovered the [[Solomon Islands]] first sighted by the [[Spaniard]] [[Álvaro de Mendaña]] in 1568,&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], vol. 25, p.254: ''"[[Pacific Islands]]"''. Chicago, 1989. {{ISBN|0-85229-493-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] first discovered by [[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernández]] in 1574.&lt;ref name="captain_moss"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.royal-navy.org/lib//index.php?title=Captain_Mosses_Account_of_the_Islands_of_Juan_Fernandez_and_Masa_Fuero%2C_in_the_Pacific_Ocean|title=Captain Mosses Account of the Islands of Juan Fernandez and Masa Fuero, in the Pacific Ocean – Royal Navy History|year=1807|volume=18|work=The Naval Chronicle|accessdate=1 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722002222/http://www.royal-navy.org/lib//index.php?title=Captain_Mosses_Account_of_the_Islands_of_Juan_Fernandez_and_Masa_Fuero,_in_the_Pacific_Ocean|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weakened by severe illness, he arrived back in England, at [[Spithead]], on 20 March 1769, having been ably assisted by Lieutenant [[Erasmus Gower]] who was, for much of the voyage, the only fit person on board ''Swallow'' who could navigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The following year he returned to Jersey as seigneur of Trinity and took part in [[Politics of Jersey|Jersey politics]]. He was promoted to post captain in 1771 and was in London on 5 May 1772, when he married Mary Rachel Silvester (1741–1815), a doctor's daughter.  Four of their five children survived to adulthood, including:
*the second son, [[Philip Carteret Silvester]] (1777–1828), entered the navy like his father and inherited a [[baronetcy]] from his maternal uncle Sir John Silvester
*a daughter, Elizabeth Mary (1774 – 21 September 1851, [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]]), in 1818 became the third wife of [[William Symonds]], [[Surveyor of the Navy]].

Carteret's health was ruined by his voyage of exploration, and he received little reward from the Admiralty. He did not have the patrons which were necessary for naval promotion at this time, and this and his complaints before the voyage on the ''Swallow'''s ill-suitedness to the voyage ensured that his requests for a new ship in 1769 fell on deaf ears. Put on [[half-pay]], the petition for increasing half-pay which he got together helped many officers, but not Carteret himself. In the meantime, in 1773, his journals of the voyage were published as part of ''An Account of the Voyages undertaken by Byron, Wallis, Carteret and Cook'', but that volume's editor [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]] made many changes to his account and so Carteret drafted a correct version of his own (which, however, only got published in 1965, by the [[Hakluyt Society]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallis|first1=Helen|title=Carteret's voyage round the world, 1766–1769|date=1965|publisher=[[Hakluyt Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His new ship, {{HMS|Endymion|1779|6}}, at last came on 1 August 1779 and despite problems in the [[English Channel|Channel]], off [[Senegal]] and off the [[Leeward Islands]] (at the last of which Carteret was nearly killed in a hurricane) he arrived in the [[West Indies]] as instructed. Despite having a share in four [[prize ship]]s, he was paid off and the ''Endymion'' transferred to another captain. All his petitions for a new ship were unsuccessful and he suffered a stroke in 1792, retiring to [[Southampton]] in 1794 with the rank of [[Rear Admiral (Royal Navy)|rear admiral]]. He died there two years later and was buried in the catacombs of [[All Saints' Church, Southampton]].

[[File:Purple poppy (28893975492).jpg|thumb|A purple poppy, on which the symbol is based]]
The '''purple poppy''' is a symbol  of remembrance in the United Kingdom for animals that served during wartime.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; The symbol was created in 2006 based on the principle of the traditional red [[remembrance poppy]] for [[Remembrance Day]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

In contemporary service, most animals in United Kingdom military service are [[military working dogs]], particularly in the [[1st Military Working Dog Regiment]]. Historically the greatest number of animal casualties in conflict have been [[Horses in warfare|horses and ponies]].

== Background ==
The purple [[poppy]] was created in 2006 by the charity [[Animal Aid]] as a way to commemorate animals which served during conflicts as the charity viewed that they had been the forgotten victims of war.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|first=James |last=McClean |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/29848595/remembrance-poppy-controversies-and-how-to-wear-it |title=Remembrance poppy: Controversies and how to wear it |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately eight million horses and donkeys died during the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/poppy-appeal-white-gold-purple-remembrance-day-a3971771.html |title=Poppy Appeal: White, gold and purple poppy meanings and where to get them for Remembrance Day 2018 |newspaper=[[Evening Standard]] |date=2018-10-25 |accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to be worn alongside red or white poppies.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Animal Aid continued to sell the purple poppy with proceeds going to them until 2015 when they replaced the symbol with an enamel purple paw badge as they felt it was being misinterpreted {{mdash}} the animals are not "heroes" but victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Andrew |last1=Tyler |url=https://www.animalaidshop.org.uk/accessories/the-purple-poppy |publisher=Animals Aid |title=Purple poppy |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/25/what-is-the-purple-poppy-appeal-and-where-can-i-buy-one-8074878/ |title=What is the purple poppy appeal and where can I buy one? |publisher=Metro |date=2018-10-25 |accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purple poppy symbol was subsequently picked up by the Murphy's Army charity in 2016 and continued to be sold by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/purple-poppy-remembrance-day-what-15345757 |title=What is a purple poppy and where can you buy one for Remembrance Day? |newspaper=[[Manchester Evening News]] |date= |accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smallholder.co.uk/news/15652375.Purple_poppies__lest_we_forget_animals_harmed_in_conflict/ |title=Purple poppies: lest we forget animals harmed in conflict |work=[[Smallholder (magazine)|Smallholder]] |date=2017-11-12 |accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a specified purple poppy day in addition to Remembrance Day on 11 November where purple poppies would be worn. The date is movable, however. In 2018, in order to coincide with 100 years since the end of the First World War, 23 August was chosen as purple poppy day to coincide with the [[Battle of Mons]]. This was the date of the first battle between British and German forces during the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Centenary Digital |url=http://www.centenarynews.com/article/purple-poppy-day-launches---august-23---in-memory-of-first-world-war-horses |title=Purple Poppy Day launches, August 23, in memory of First World War horses |newspaper=Centenary News |date=2018-08-23 |accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purple poppy was not endorsed by [[The Royal British Legion]], which sells the official red remembrance poppies.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; However they did state: "We see no conflict in wearing the red poppy next to the purple or [[white poppy]]. Many animal rights supporters also support our work. We do ask that the items are not offered alongside each other however as this would confuse the public."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Some towns have included purple poppies alongside red ones in official Remembrance displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-45933097 |title=Prince Harry 'proud' of Rutland's poppy WW1 tribute |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reactive sulfur species''' (RSS) are a family of sulfur-based chemical compounds that can oxidize and inhibit thiol-proteins and enzymes. They are often formed by the oxidation of Thiols and disulfides into higher oxidation states. Examples of RSS include [[persulfide]]s, [[polysulfide]]s and [[thiosulfate]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov_January_28_2016c"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Reactive sulfur species: an emerging concept in oxidative stress |pmid=12033429 | doi=10.1515/BC.2002.042 |volume=383 |pages=375-88 | last1 = Giles | first1 = GI | last2 = Jacob | first2 = C | journal=Biol Chem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Nature.com_January_28_2016c"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v11/n7/full/nchembio.1834.html |title=Biogenesis of reactive sulfur species for signaling by hydrogen sulfide oxidation pathways |journal=Nature Chemical Biology |author= |accessdate= January 28, 2016 |volume=11|doi= 10.1038/nchembio.1834|pmc=4818113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rock glaciers''' are distinctive [[geomorphological]] [[landform]]s, consisting either of angular rock debris frozen in [[:wikt:interstitial|interstitial]] ice, former "true" glaciers overlain by a layer of talus, or something in between. Rock glaciers may extend outward and downslope from [[Scree|talus]] cones, [[glacier]]s or [[terminal moraine]]s of glaciers.&lt;ref name=Moffit&gt;{{Cite book |author=Fred H. Moffit |author2=Stephen R. Capps |title=Geology and Mineral Resources of the Nizina District, Alaska, USGS Bulletin 448 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |year=1911 |pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of rock glaciers: periglacial glaciers, or talus-derived glaciers, and glacial rock glaciers, such as the [[Timpanogos Glacier]] in [[Utah]], which are often found in the former places of glaciers. Possible [[Mars|Martian]] rock glacier features have been identified by the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter|Mars Orbiter]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/2002JE001864 | bibcode=2003JGRE..108.8032W | volume=108 | title=Rock glaciers and protalus landforms: Analogous forms and ice sources on Earth and Mars | year=2003 | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | last1 = Whalley | first1 = W. Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rock glacier, especially if its origin is unclear, can be considered as a [[discrete debris accumulation]].

==Formation==

The two known factors that must be present in order to create rock glaciers are low ice velocity and permafrost. Most glacial rock glaciers are created by the recession of debris covered glaciers. Glacial rock glaciers are often found in cirque basins where rocky debris falls off the steep sides and accumulates on ice glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the glaciers shrink, their composition changes as they become increasingly covered with debris. Eventually, the glacial ice is replaced by ice cored rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Gürgen, Gürcan, et al. "Debris Covered Glaciers and Rock Glaciers," e-Journal of New World Sciences Academy (NWSA) 5.1 (2010): 32-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the exception of ice-cored rock glaciers, rock glaciers are a periglacial process. This means that they are a nonglacial landform associated with cold climates, particularly with various aspects of frozen ground. Periglacial rock glaciers require permafrost instead of glacial ice in order to form. Instead, they are caused by continuous freezing occurring within a talus lobe.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
Rock glaciers move downslope by deformation of the ice contained within them, causing their surface to resemble those of glaciers. Some rock glaciers can reach lengths of 3&amp;nbsp;km and can have terminal embankments of 60 m high. Blocks on the surface can be up to 8 m in diameter. Flow features on the surface of rock glaciers may develop from:

* Deformation of the ice core.
* Movement of the debris cover along the debris-ice interface.
* Deformation from a period of glacial advance.
* Changes in the hydrologic balance.
Their growth and formation is subject to some debate, with three main theories:
* A [[permafrost]] origin, which implies that the features are related to permafrost action rather than glacial action;
* A [[mass wasting]] or [[landslide]] origin which does not require the presence of ice and suggests a sudden ''catastrophic'' origin with little subsequent movement.

Rock glaciers may move or ''creep'' at a very slow rate in part dependent on the amount of ice present.

According to recent studies, rock glaciers positively influence the streams around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1657/1938-4246-46.3.645|title=Influence of Rock Glaciers on Stream Hydrology in the La Sal Mountains, Utah|first1=Stuart T.|last1=Geiger|first2=J.

Subject to climate variation, rock glaciers in proximity tend to have highly synchronous movement pattern over a short time scale; over long term, however, the relationship between rock glacier velocity and climate difference may not be as pronounced, due to the influences of topographic factors and lack of ice or debris budget within the glacier body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sorg|first=Annina|last2=Kääb|first2=Andreas|last3=Roesch|first3=Andrea|last4=Bigler|first4=Christof|last5=Stoffel|first5=Markus|date=2015-02-06|title=Contrasting responses of Central Asian rock glaciers to global warming|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep08228|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=5|doi=10.1038/srep08228|issn=2045-2322| pmc=4319170 |pmid=25657095|bibcode=2015NatSR...5E8228S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human use==
Rock glaciers in the Chilean Andes help supply the water for much of Chile, including the capital of Santiago. Mining operations in the high mountains have led to the degradation and destruction of more than two rock glaciers. Several copper mines dump their waste rock onto rock glaciers, which results in faster melting and higher velocity movement of these rock glaciers. The dumping of waste rock on the rock glaciers may lead to their destabilization. In 2004, protesting irrigation farmers and environmentalists changed rules so new mining projects can no longer damage or alter rock glaciers in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book

The '''seismoelectrical method''' (which is different from the electroseismic physical principle) is based on the generation of [[electromagnetic field]]s in soils and rocks by [[seismic wave]]s. This technique is still under development and in the future it may have applications like detecting and characterizing fluids in the underground by their electrical properties, among others, usually related to fluids (porosity, transmissivity, physical properties).

==Operation==
When a seismic wave encounters an interface, it creates a charge separation at the interface forming an [[electric dipole]].  This dipole radiates an electromagnetic wave that can be detected by antennae on the ground surface.

As the seismic ([[P-wave|P]] or [[Longitudinal wave|compression]]) waves stress earth materials, four geophysical phenomena occur:
# The resistivity of the earth materials is modulated by the seismic wave;
# Electrokinetic effects analogous to streaming potentials are created by the seismic wave;
# Piezoelectric effects are created by the seismic wave; and
# High-frequency, audio- and high-frequency radio frequency impulsive responses are generated in sulfide minerals (sometimes referred to as RPE).

The dominant application of the electroseismic method is to measure the [[electrokinetic effect]] or streaming potential (item 2, above).  Electrokinetic effects are initiated by sound waves (typically P-waves) passing through a porous rock inducing relative motion of the rock matrix and fluid.  Motion of the ionic fluid through the [[capillarity|capillaries]] in the rock occurs with cations (or less commonly, anions) preferentially adhering to the capillary walls, so that applied pressure and resulting fluid flow relative to the rock matrix produces an electric dipole.  In a non-homogeneous formation, the seismic wave generates an oscillating flow of fluid and a corresponding oscillating electrical and EM field.  The resulting EM wave can be detected by electrode pairs placed on the ground surface.

However, P-waves moving through a solid that contains some moisture also generates an electric phenomenon called coseismic waves.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, S., Haartsen, M.W., 1996. Electroseismic wave properties. J. Acoust. Soc. Am.
100, 1301–1315&lt;/ref&gt; The coseismic waves travel with P-waves and are not sensitive to electrical properties of the subsurface. The dipole antenna cannot distinguish electrokinetic signal from coseismic signal so it records them both, and coseismic waves must be removed while processing field data to be able to actually interpret electrokinetic effect &lt;ref name="Zyserman"&gt;Zyserman, F., Jouniaux, L., Warden, S., and Garambois, S. (2015). "Borehole seismoelectric logging using a shear-wave source: Possible application to CO2 disposal?." International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, 10.1016/j.ijggc.2014.12.009, 89-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the moment, there is not a field routine operation method, but in scientific studies an array of several dipole antennas is placed along a straight line to record seismoelectric waves, and an array of geophones placed between dipole antennas to record seismic wave arrivals. Geophones are necessary to be able to suppress coseismic waves from the seismoelectric signal, so that electrokinetic effect can be separated and studied.&lt;ref&gt;Dupuis, J.C., Butler, K.E., Kepic, A.W., 2007. Seismoelectric imaging of the vadose zone of a sand aquifer. Geophysics 72, A81–A85.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The electroseismic method is very susceptible to electrical cultural noise, and has also the same noise sources as reflection seismic method, which include ground roll, multiples and random noise. Seismoelectrical method also has a very low signal-to-noise ratio, because the attenuation of electromagnetic waves inside the earth is 1/r^3, thus theoretically limiting its depth of exploration to three hundred meters.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, A., and Gist, G., 1993, Geophysical applications of electrokinetic conversion: The Leading Edge, 12, 1169-1173&lt;/ref&gt; Typical electroseismic signals are at the microvolt level.  The electroseismic signal is proportional to the pressure of the seismic wave. Thus it is possible to increase the signal by using stronger seismic sources.&lt;ref&gt;Dean T, Dupuis C, Herrmann R, Valuri J (2012) A brute-strength approach to improving the quality of Seismoelectric data. SEG Las Vegas annual meeting, SEG technical program expanded abstracts, pp 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The electrokinetic effect is produced by several kinds of contrasts between layers like porosity contrasts, potential contrasts, viscosity contrasts and saturation in fluids contrasts among others.&lt;ref name="Zyserman" /&gt; The possible causes of elektronkinetic effect between layers is still now a matter of study. With nowadays knowledge and technology it's really hard to determine without further data (like borehole or other geophysics data from the location), what are electrokinetic conversions produced by, and further studies will have to be carried out to be able to interpret electrokinetic data correctly. Although that, the electrokinetic effect has a promising future in near-surface and borehole geophysics.

==Examples of successful field studies==
The propagation of seismic waves in porous rocks is associated with a small transient deformation of [[rock matrix]] and pore space which can cause electromagnetic fields of observable amplitude if the pores are saturated. Seismoelectric field measurements are expected to help localize permeable layers in porous rocks and provide information about [[Viscoelasticity|anelastic]] properties. This theoretical potential for hydrogeological applications, however, is so far confirmed only by a very limited number of successful field studies. As a consequence, the seismoelectric method is still far from being routinely used.&lt;!--THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN COPIED FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE: We present a number of field data examples which prove a successful detection of the seismoelectric wave converted from seismic compressional waves at a layer boundary. Our data include the mapping of a 2D-structure.

[[File:Kalová laguna Sojovice.jpg|thumb|Settling pond for iron particles at water works]]
'''Settling''' is the process by which particulates settle to the bottom of a liquid and form a [[sediment]]. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to [[Centrifuge|centrifugal motion]] will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming a [[slurry]] at the vessel base.

Settling is an important operation in many applications, such as [[mining]], [[wastewater]] treatment, biological science, [[outer space|space]] [[rocket propellant|propellant]] reignition,&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902&gt;

== Physics ==
[[File:Stokes sphere.svg|thumb|upright|Creeping flow past a sphere: [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamline]]s, drag force ''F''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and force by gravity ''F''&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.]]   
For settling particles that are considered individually, i.e. dilute particle solutions, there are two main forces enacting upon any particle. The primary force is an applied force, such as gravity, and a [[Drag (physics)|drag]] force that is due to the motion of the particle through the [[fluid]]. The applied force is usually not affected by the particle's velocity, whereas the drag force is a function of the particle velocity.

For a particle at rest no drag force will be exhibited, which causes the particle to accelerate due to the applied force. When the particle accelerates, the drag force acts in the direction opposite to the particle's motion, retarding further acceleration, in the absence of other forces drag directly opposes the applied force. As the particle increases in velocity eventually the drag force and the applied force will [[limit (mathematics)|approximately equate]], causing no further change in the particle's velocity. This velocity is known as the [[terminal velocity]], ''settling velocity'' or ''fall velocity'' of the particle. This is readily measurable by examining the rate of fall of individual particles.

The terminal velocity of the particle is affected by many parameters, i.e. anything that will alter the particle's drag. Hence the terminal velocity is most notably dependent upon [[Particle size|grain size]], the shape (roundness and sphericity) and density of the grains, as well as to the [[viscosity]] and [[density]] of the fluid.

=== Single particle drag ===

==== Stokes' drag ====
{{main|Stokes' law}}
[[File:Reynolds-drag.svg|thumb|200px|right|Dimensionless force versus Reynolds number for spherical particles]]
For dilute suspensions, [[Stokes Law|Stokes' law]] predicts the settling velocity of small spheres in [[fluid]], either air or water.  This originates due to the strength of viscous forces at the surface of the particle providing the majority of the retarding force. Stokes' law finds many applications in the natural sciences, and is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;w=\frac{2(\rho_p-\rho_f)gr^2}{9\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the settling velocity, ''ρ'' is density (the subscripts ''p'' and ''f'' indicate particle and fluid respectively), ''g'' is the acceleration due to gravity, ''r'' is the radius of the particle and ''μ'' is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.

Stokes' law applies when the [[Reynolds number]], Re, of the particle is less than 0.1. Experimentally Stokes' law is found to hold within 1% for &lt;math&gt; Re \leq 0.1&lt;/math&gt;, within 3% for &lt;math&gt;Re \leq 0.5&lt;/math&gt;  and within 9% &lt;math&gt; Re \leq 1.0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;{{cite book| title=Introduction to Particle Technology | author=Martin Rhodes }}&lt;/ref&gt; With increasing Reynolds numbers, Stokes law begins to break down due to the increasing importance of fluid inertia, requiring the use of empirical solutions to calculate drag forces.

==== Newtonian drag ====
Defining a [[drag coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt;, as the ratio of the force experienced by the particle divided by the [[impact pressure]] of the fluid, a coefficient that can be considered as the transfer of available fluid force into drag is established. In this region the inertia of the impacting fluid is responsible for the majority of force transfer to the particle.

:&lt;math&gt; C_d = \frac{F_d}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_f U^2 A} &lt;/math&gt;

For a spherical particle in the Stokes regime this value is not constant, however in the Newtonian drag regime the drag on a sphere can be approximated by a constant, 0.44. This constant value implies that the efficiency of transfer of energy from the fluid to the particle is not a function of fluid velocity.

As such the [[terminal velocity]] of a particle in a Newtonian regime can again be obtained by equating the drag force to the applied force, resulting in the following expression

:&lt;math&gt; w = 2.46\left( \frac{(\rho_p-\rho_f)gr}{\rho_f}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} .&lt;/math&gt;

==== Transitional drag ====
In the intermediate region between Stokes drag and Newtonian drag, there exists a transitional regime, where the analytical solution to the problem of a falling sphere becomes problematic. To solve this, empirical expressions are used to calculate drag in this region. One such empirical equation is that of Schiller and Naumann, and may be valid for &lt;math&gt; 0.2 \leq Re \leq 1000&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name="CoulsonAndRichardsonV2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical Engineering|volume=2|date=1955|publisher=Pergamon press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{F}{\rho_f U^2 A} = \frac{12}{ \mathrm{Re}} \left( 1 + 0.15\mathrm{Re}^{0.687} \right) . &lt;/math&gt;

=== Hindered settling ===
Stokes, transitional and Newtonian settling describe the behaviour of a single spherical particle in an infinite fluid, known as free settling. However this model has limitations in practical application. Alternate considerations, such as the interaction of particles in the fluid, or the interaction of the particles with the container walls can modify the settling behaviour. Settling that has these forces in appreciable magnitude is known as hindered settling. Subsequently semi-analytic or empirical solutions may be used to perform meaningful hindered settling calculations.

== Applications ==
The solid-gas flow systems are present in many industrial applications, as dry, catalytic reactors, settling tanks, pneumatic conveying of solids, among others. Obviously, in industrial operations the drag rule is not simple as a single sphere settling in a stationary fluid. However, this knowledge indicates how drag behaves in more complex systems, which are designed and studied by engineers applying empirical and more sophisticated tools.

For example, ''Settling [[Storage tank|tanks]]'' are used for separating solids and/or oil from another liquid. In [[food processing]], the vegetable is crushed and placed inside of a settling tank with water. The oil floats the top of the water then is collected. In water and waste [[water treatment]] a [[flocculant]] is often added prior to settling to form larger particles that settle out quickly in a settling tank or an [[inclined plate settler]], leaving the water with a lower [[turbidity]].

In [[winemaking]], the [[French (language)|French]] term for this process is ''[[:fr:Débourbage|débourbage]]''. This step usually occurs in white wine production before the start of [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]].&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 223"&gt;Robinson, J. (ed) (2006) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition p. 223 Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settleable solids analysis===
'''Settleable solids''' are the particulates that settle out of a still fluid. Settleable solids can be quantified for a [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] using an Imhoff cone. The standard Imhoff cone of transparent glass or plastic holds one liter of liquid and has calibrated markings to measure the volume of solids accumulated in the bottom of the conical container after settling for one hour. A standardized Imhoff cone procedure is commonly used to measure suspended solids in [[wastewater]] or [[stormwater runoff]]. The simplicity of the method makes it popular for estimating [[water quality]].

The water sample to be measured should be representative of the total stream. Samples are best collected from the discharge falling from a pipe or over a weir, because samples skimmed from the top of a flowing channel may fail to capture larger, high-density solids moving along the bottom of the channel. The sampling bucket is vigorously stirred to uniformly re-suspend all collected solids immediately before pouring the volume required to fill the cone. The filled cone is immediately placed in a stationary holding rack to allow quiescent settling. The rack should be located away from heating sources, including direct sunlight, which might cause currents within the cone from thermal density changes of the liquid contents. After 45 minutes of settling, the cone is partially rotated about its axis of symmetry just enough to dislodge any settled material adhering to the side of the cone. Accumulated sediment is observed and measured fifteen minutes later, after one hour of total settling time.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Mary Ann (1975) ''Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater'' 14th edition, APHA, AWWA &amp; WPCF {{ISBN|0-87553-078-8}} pp. 89–91, 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Park grid.JPG|thumb|Park fence shadow is distorted by an uneven snow surface]]
A '''shadow''' is a dark area where [[light]] from a light source is blocked by an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] object. It occupies all of the three-dimensional volume behind an object with light in front of it. The [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a shadow is a two-[[dimension]]al [[silhouette]], or a reverse [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection]] of the object blocking the light.

== Point and non-point light sources ==
[[File:Diagram of umbra, penumbra &amp; antumbra.png|thumb|right|[[Umbra, penumbra and antumbra]].]]
A [[point source]] of light casts only a simple shadow, called an "'''umbra'''". For a non-point or "extended" source of light, the shadow is divided into the [[umbra, penumbra and antumbra]]. The wider the light source, the more blurred the shadow becomes.  If two penumbras overlap, the shadows appear to attract and merge.  This is known as the '''[[Shadow blister effect]]'''.

The outlines of the shadow zones can be found by tracing the rays of light emitted by the outermost regions of the extended light source. The umbra region does not receive any direct light from any part of the light source, and is the darkest. A viewer located in the umbra region cannot directly see any part of the light source.

By contrast, the penumbra is illuminated by some parts of the light source, giving it an intermediate level of light intensity. A viewer located in the penumbra region will see the light source, but it is partially blocked by the object casting the shadow.

If there is more than one light source, there will be several shadows, with the overlapping parts darker, and various combinations of brightnesses or even colors. The more [[Diffuser (optics)|diffuse]] the lighting is, the softer and more indistinct the shadow outlines become, until they disappear. The lighting of an overcast sky produces few visible shadows.

The absence of diffusing atmospheric effects in the [[vacuum]] of [[outer space]] produces shadows that are stark and sharply delineated by high-contrast boundaries between light and dark.

For a person or object touching the surface where the shadow is projected (e.g. a person standing on the ground, or a pole in the ground) the shadows converge at the point of contact.

A shadow shows, apart from distortion, the same image as the silhouette when looking at the object from the sun-side, hence the [[mirror image]] of the silhouette seen from the other side.

== Astronomy ==
[[File:Three moons and their shadows parade across Jupiter.jpg|thumb|Three moons ([[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Io (moon)|Io]]) and their shadows parade across [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=March of the moons|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1504/|accessdate=24 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728173551/http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1504/|archivedate=28 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The names [[umbra, penumbra and antumbra]] are often used for the shadows cast by [[astronomical object]]s, though they are sometimes used to describe levels of darkness, such as in sunspots.  An astronomical object casts human-visible shadows when its [[apparent magnitude]] is equal or lower than -4.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070627044109/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/scienceques2005/20060406.htm NASA Science Question of the Week]. Gsfc.nasa.gov (April 7, 2006). Retrieved on 2013-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the only astronomical objects able to produce visible shadows on Earth are the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and, in the right conditions, [[Venus]] or [[Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/18/young-astronomer-captures-a-shadow-cast-by-jupiter/#.UaDO1UAoNAU |title=Young astronomer captures a shadow cast by Jupiter : Bad Astronomy |publisher=Blogs.discovermagazine.com |date=2011-11-18 |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702142010/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2011/11/18/young-astronomer-captures-a-shadow-cast-by-jupiter#.UaDO1UAoNAU |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shadow cast by the [[Earth]] on the [[Moon]] is a [[lunar eclipse]]. Conversely, a shadow cast by the Moon on the Earth is a [[solar eclipse]].

== Daytime variation ==
The sun casts shadows which change dramatically through the day. The length of a shadow cast on the ground is proportional to the [[cotangent]] of the sun's [[Altitude (astronomy)#Elevation angle|elevation angle]]—its angle ''θ'' relative to the horizon. Near sunrise and sunset, when ''θ'' = 0° and ''cot(θ)'' = ∞, shadows can be extremely long. If the sun passes directly overhead, then ''θ'' = 90°, ''cot(θ)'' = 0, and shadows are cast directly underneath objects.

Such variations have long aided travellers during their travels, especially in barren regions such as the [[Arabian Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Edinburgh monthly review|date=1820|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Propagation speed ==
[[File:Steam phase eruption of Castle Geyser with crepuscular rays and shadow.jpg|thumb|[[Steam]] phase [[eruption]] of [[Castle Geyser]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] casts a shadow on its own steam. [[Crepuscular rays]] are also visible.]]
The farther the distance from the object blocking the light to the surface of projection, the larger the silhouette (they are considered [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]]). Also, if the object is moving, the shadow cast by the object will project an image with dimensions (length) expanding proportionally faster than the object's own rate of movement. The increase of size and movement is also true if the distance between the object of interference and the light source are closer. This, however, does not mean the shadow may move faster than light, even when projected at vast distances, such as [[light year]]s. The loss of light, which projects the shadow, will move towards the surface of projection at [[light speed]].

Although the edge of a shadow appears to "move" along a wall, in actuality the increase of a shadow's length is part of a new projection which propagates at the speed of light from the object of interference. Since there is no actual communication between points in a shadow (except for reflection or interference of light, at the speed of light), a shadow that projects over a surface of large distances (light years) [[Special relativity#Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light|cannot convey information]] between those distances with the shadow's edge.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Gibbs (1997) [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/FTL.html#3 Is Faster-Than-Light Travel or Communication Possible?] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lLRguF0I?url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SpeedOfLight/FTL.html |date=2009-11-17 }} math.ucr.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

== Color ==
Visual artists are usually very aware of colored light emitted or reflected from several sources, which can generate complex multicolored shadows. [[Chiaroscuro]], [[sfumato]], and [[silhouette]] are examples of artistic techniques which make deliberate use of shadow effects.

During the daytime, a shadow cast by an opaque object illuminated by sunlight has a bluish tinge. This happens because of [[Rayleigh scattering]], the same property that causes the sky to appear blue. The opaque object is able to block the light of the sun, but not the ambient light of the sky which is blue as the atmosphere molecules scatter blue light more effectively. As a result, the shadow appears bluish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pa.uky.edu/sciworks/qlight.htm Question Board – Questions about Light]. Pa.uky.edu. Retrieved on 2013-04-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Three-dimensional shadows ==
[[File:Fog shadow of GGB.jpg|thumb|Fog shadow of the south tower of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]]]
A shadow occupies a three-dimensional volume of space, but this is usually not visible until it projects onto a reflective surface. A light [[fog]], mist, or dust cloud can reveal the 3D presence of volumetric patterns in light and shadow.

Fog shadows may look odd to viewers who are not used to seeing shadows in three dimensions. A thin fog is just dense enough to be illuminated by the light that passes through the gaps in a structure or in a tree.  As a result, the path of an object's shadow through the fog becomes visible as a darkened volume. In a sense, these shadow lanes are the inverse of [[crepuscular rays]] caused by beams of light, but caused by the shadows of solid objects.

[[Theatrical fog]] and strong beams of light are sometimes used by lighting designers and visual artists who seek to highlight three-dimensional aspects of their work. 

== Shadow inversions ==
Oftentimes shadows of chain-linked fences and other such objects become inverted (light and dark areas are swapped) as they get farther from the object. A chain-link fence shadow will start with light diamonds and shadow outlines when it is touching the fence, but it will gradually blur. Eventually, if the fence is tall enough, the light pattern will go to shadow diamonds and light outlines.

== Photography ==
[[File:Moonlight shadow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Moonlight]] shadow of a photographer]]
In photography, which is essentially recording patterns of light, shade, and color, "highlights" and "shadows" are the brightest and darkest parts, respectively, of a scene or image. [[Photographic exposure]] must be adjusted (unless special effects are wanted) to allow the [[Photographic film|film]] or [[sensor]], which has limited [[dynamic range]], to record detail in the highlights without them being washed out, and in the shadows without their becoming undifferentiated black areas.

On [[satellite imagery]] and [[aerial photograph]]s, taken vertically, tall buildings can be recognized as such by their long shadows (if the photographs are not taken in the tropics around noon), while these also show more of the shape of these buildings.

== Analogous concepts ==
''Shadow'' as a term is often used for any occlusion or blockage, not just those with respect to light.  For example, a [[rain shadow]] is a dry area, which with respect to the prevailing [[wind]] direction, is beyond a [[mountain range]]; the elevated terrain impedes rainclouds from entering the dry zone. An [[acoustic shadow]] occurs when direct sound has been blocked or diverted around a given area.

== Cultural aspects ==
An unattended [[Shade (mythology)|shade]] was thought by some cultures to be similar to that of a ghost. The name for the fear of shadows is "sciophobia" or "sciaphobia".

[[Chhaya]] is the Hindu goddess of shadows.

In [[heraldry]], when a charge is supposedly shown "in shadow" (the appearance is of the charge merely being outlined in a neutral tint rather than being of one or more [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] different from the field on which it is placed), it is technnically described as "umbrated".  Supposedly, only a limited number of specific charges can be so depicted.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''TAITRONICS''', or '''Taipei International Electronics Show''' ({{zh|t=台北國際電子展}}) is a [[Taipei Trade Shows|trade show]] held every October by [[Taiwan External Trade Development Council]] and Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association to promote electronic industry in Taiwan since 1974.

After entering the [[World Trade Center (Taipei)|Taipei World Trade Center]] in 1986, the TAITRONICS held every spring and autumn with different topics. Initially, the spring show before 1994 was ever named with Taipei International Electrical Equipment Show. In addition, TAITRA made an initiation on DVD and optoelectronic show from 2001 to 2005.

With a rapid change in electronic industry, some subsidiary shows confronted to be combined and suspended. In 2006, the TAITRA priory repackaged Taipei Opto and TAITRONICS Spring with AutoTronics Taipei (Taipei International Automobile Electronics Show) and DigiTronics Taipei, to adapt trendy changes on electronic industry. Afterward, the Taipei Computer Association also suspended "Taipei Telecom", a 14-year-old telecommunication show, with quality issue and category duplications with TICA (Taipei Computer Applications Show) since 2001.

In the presence, only the AutoTronics Taipei can be held sustainably in conjunction with two auto shows - Taipei AMPA (Taipei International Auto Parts &amp; Accessories Show) and Motorcycle Taiwan (Taiwan International Motorcycle Industry Show) every spring since 2007.

Not only the main show every October, the TAITRA also promotes this show brand successively to help the [[Information communication technology|ICT]] and electronic industries expanding in [[Thailand]] and [[India]] since 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18634">[[Image:Ottoman-Tehcir Law.jpg|280px|thumb|The Tehcir Law]]
The '''Tehcir Law''' (from ''tehcir'', a word of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin in  [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and meaning "deportation" or "forced displacement" as defined by the [[Türk Dil Kurumu|Turkish Language Institute]]), or, officially by the Republic of Turkey, the "Sevk ve İskân Kanunu" (Relocation and Resettlement Law)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fakulteler.atauni.edu.tr/ermenia/mndty.php?al=3 |title=''Sevk ve İskân Kanunu'' |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Research Centre for Turkish–Armenian Relations, [[Ataturk University]] |accessdate=April 25, 2010 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426035934/http://fakulteler.atauni.edu.tr/ermenia/mndty.php?al=3 |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a law passed by the [[Ottoman Parliament]] on May 27, 1915 authorizing the deportation of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Ottoman Armenian|Armenian]] population. The resettlement campaign resulted in the deaths of anywhere between 800,000 and over 1,800,000 civilians in what is commonly referred to as the [[Armenian Genocide]]. The bill was officially enacted on June 1, 1915 and expired on February 8, 1916.

== Issues ==
{{further|Armenian Question}}
The Tehcir Law was part of the "special measures" (declared in a euphemistic language) against the Armenian population taken by the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]]. This was coupled with a second set of orders given to the [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|"Special Organization"]] for systematic elimination of the evacuated population during the death marches,&lt;ref&gt;America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915, by Jay Murray Winter, Cambridge University Press, (2004), pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; also including the alleged taking care of the vacated properties.&lt;ref name="Their Properties 2007 pp. 138"&gt;Legislative Provisions of the Ottoman/Turkish Governments Regarding Minorities and Their Properties, Anastasia Lekka, Mediterranean Quarterly 18.1 (2007) pp. 138–139&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman archives document that the Armenian deportations started as early as March 2, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;The Deportation of the Armenians of Dörtyol, Ciphered telegram from the Ministry of the Interior to the Province of Adana, BOA. DH. ŞFR, nr. 50/141&lt;/ref&gt;

After the expiration of the Tehcir Law, deportations and massacres still occurred. On September 13, 1915, the Ottoman parliament passed the "Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation," stating that all property, including land, livestock, and homes belonging to Armenians, was to be confiscated by the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Vahakn N. Dadrian (2003) "The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus" Berghahn Books page. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Before the Ottoman parliament implemented the "Tehcir Law", there was a circular by [[Talaat Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Archive code BOA. DH. ŞFR, nr.52/96,97,98&lt;/ref&gt; In the night of April 24, 1915, [[Mehmed Talaat]] Bey, who was the minister of interior at the time, ordered [[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915|250 Armenian intellectuals]] to be deported from [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Balakian, Peter (2003). ''The Burning Tigris'', pp. 211–2. Harper Collins. {{ISBN|0-06-019840-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1915, Mehmed Talaat Pasha requested that the [[Cabinet (government)|Ottoman Cabinet]] and the then [[Grand Vizier]] [[Said Halim Pasha]] legalize a measure for relocation and settlement of the Armenians to other places. Talaat's words were "the Armenian riots and massacres, which had arisen in a number of places in the country are a threat to national security."&lt;ref&gt;Balakian. ''The Burning Tigris'', pp. 186–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The nature of the law ==
Tehcir Law was officially a "temporary" law that expired on February 8, 1916. It was a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], planned, implemented and enforced with an office (created by the law) to coordinate the activities under the name of "Migrant General Directorate" (Ottoman Turkish: Muhacirin Müdüriyet-i Umumîyesi). The civil law gave the military an enforcing power only if there were parties opposing the implementation. The rules and regulations of the law, as published in the ''Takvim-i Vekayi'' (Ottoman official newspaper), were public and they were shared with all the political parties.

== Contents ==
The Tehcir Law was allegedly about 
# the military measures against those opposing government orders, national defense, and the protection of peace and against those organizing armed attacks and resistance, and killing rebels during aggression and uprising in wartime, 
# the transfer and resettlement on a single basis or en masse, the people living in villages and towns who are found to be engaged in espionage or treason, 
# the temporary law's effect and expiration, and 
# the definition of the responsible parties (application).

One Ottoman Archival material, dated from July 12, 1915 suggests that massacres were part of those measures implemented against the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;Ciphered telegram from the Ministry of the Interior, BOA. DH. ŞFR, nr. 54/406&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Martial Court supports this by referring to documents that claim that the main reason for the evacuation was annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;Ihsan Bey, Director of the Special Office of the Interior Ministry confirms that Abdulahad Nuri Bey, who had been sent from Istanbul to the office in Aleppo has stated: ''The main reason for the deportations is annihilation'', Takvim-i Vekayi, April 27, 1919 Number 3540&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this law was directed against one particular ethnic group (the [[Armenians]]), the Assyrian population of the Ottoman Empire also fell victim as did some other [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Christians from the East]].&lt;ref&gt;Massacres, Resistance, Protectors: Muslim-Christian Relations in Eastern Anatolia During World War I By David Gaunt, Gorgias Press LLC, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the text of the law, there is no explicit mention of the [[Armenian Question]], and the text contains that: (1) the ill, (2) the blind, (3) Catholics, (4) Protestants, (5) the soldiers and their families, (6) the officers, (7) merchants, some workers and masters were not subject to evacuation. If conditions got worse, these groups are ordered to be settled in the city centers.&lt;ref name="Coding Office, no 56/27; no 67/186"&gt;Coding Office, no 56/27; no 67/186&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]] granted missionaries a protectorate state (see:[[Protectorate of missions]]). There is a group of rules that grant rights to missionaries under the Ottoman Empire. Another decipher orders the [[Armenian Catholic Church|Catholic Armenian]] missionaries not to leave the Ottoman Empire until the next order.&lt;ref&gt;BOA. DH. SFR, nr. 54/55 archive, which stats: Ermeni Katolik misyonerlerle sörlerin simdilik orada kalmalari daha münâsibdir&lt;/ref&gt; This message was not respected in some centers, such as [[Marash|Maraş]] and [[Konya]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example BOA. DH. SFR, nr. 58/2 for Konya or BOA. DH. SFR, nr.63/157 for Marash,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fate of the subjects ===
The alleged intention of the law, which was published during [[World War I]], was a "temporary movement of the Ottoman citizens" during the conflicts and not the permanent displacement as there was a decree (regulation, or adjunct) with respect to the relocated citizens by the "Tehcir Law" who wanted to return; it claimed "except those people [affected by the Tehcir Law], no one else will be touched."&lt;ref name="Rights"&gt;{{cite web

|quote=The Arabic originated word "tehcir" means "emigration / immigration", it definitely does not mean "deportation" or "exile". Hence the law commonly known as the "Tehcir Law" is the same as "Temporary Law On The Military Measures To Be Taken For Those Who Resist The Governmental Acts And Supplementation's." The word used to explain the implementation in line with this law is "tenkil" in the Ottoman language and means "transport- not the equivalent of "deportation", "exile" or "proscription" in Latin originated languages. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rights-0"&gt;{{cite web

|quote=In the letter sent by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Mustafa Pasha, to the Prime Ministry in January 1919, it is indicated that orders have been given to the related places for the transportation of the Armenians, who wanted to return to their former locations and that the necessary precautions have been taken. (6) The decree of return prepared by the government, dated December 31, 1918 is as follows: 1- Only the ones, who want to return, will be migrated, except those people, no one else will be touched&lt;br&gt; 2- The precautions necessary will be taken for assuring a good journey, and for preventing housing and catering shortage in the returning locations; the migration and returning transactions will be started after contact is established with the administrators of the regions they will return to and after the necessary precautions are taken.&lt;br&gt; 3- The abandoned houses and lands will be returned to the owners.&lt;br&gt; 4- The houses of the ones, where formerly immigrants have been placed, will be evacuated.&lt;br&gt; 5- A few families may be settled in the same location temporally in order to provide sufficient housing.&lt;br&gt; 6- Buildings such as churches, schools and the income generating locations will be returned to the society they belong to.&lt;br&gt; 7- If requested, the orphans will be returned to their guardians, who will be carefully determined, or to their societies, after their identifications are carefully determined.&lt;br&gt; 8- The ones, who have converted their religions, will be able to return to their former religion if they want to.&lt;br&gt; 9- Among the Armenian women, who have married to Muslims and converted their religions will be free to return to their former religion. In this case their marriage act will be automatically canceled. The problems relating to the ones, who do not want to return to their former religion and not wish to divorce from their husbands will be dissolved by the courts.&lt;br&gt; 10- The Armenian properties, which are not in anyone's ownership, will be returned to their first owners and the return of those that have become the property of treasury will be decided with the approval of the property officers. Further explanatory minutes will be prepared about this issue.&lt;br&gt; 11- The property sold to the Muslim immigrants will be delivered to their first owners gradually as their owners return. Article 4 will be definitely applied.&lt;br&gt; 12- If the Muslim immigrants have made repairs and additions in the houses and stores that will be returned to their former owners, or if they have planted the lands and olive groves, the rights of both sides will be observed.&lt;br&gt; 13- The immigration and expenses of the Armenians in need will be met from the Military College Allowance.&lt;br&gt; 14- The amount of transportation made until the current time and the amount of transportation made and the target location of such transportation will be notified on the fifteenth and last days of each month.&lt;br&gt; 15- The Armenians, who have left the Ottoman borders and who want to return, will not be accepted until a new order is issued. ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also if we look at the fourth section of the Tehcir law, it was specifically designed to hold the enforcer units responsible to follow up and record the properties owned by the subjects of the immigration.&lt;ref name="Rights-1"&gt;{{cite web

|quote=These commissions are to determine Armenian properties in the villages and towns that are evacuated, and to keep detailed record books. One of the books is to be kept in the regional churches, one to be submitted to the regional administration, and one shall be kept by the commission. Non-durable goods and animal stock shall be auctioned and the money shall be kept. In location where a commission is not appointed, the provisions of the communiqué shall be enforced by the officers in the regions. Both the commission and the regional administrators shall be responsible for the protection of these properties until the '''Armenians return'''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law included a responsible party for the protection of properties the owners could/will return in a later term.&lt;ref name="Rights-1" /&gt; Another law was passed to regulate the enforcement of this section On 10 June 1915.&lt;ref&gt;ATBD, December 1982, ibid., no:81, document 1832&lt;/ref&gt; In this section, it was demanded that there would be three copies of this information; one kept in the regional churches, one in the regional administration, and one kept by the commission responsible for the execution of the law. The second and third parties of this law were held responsible for the protection of the properties until the immigrants' return.&lt;ref name="Rights-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ATBD, December 1982, ibid., no:81, document 1832&lt;/ref&gt;

While on the surface the law was allegedly temporary, the main reason of the law was to settle the [[Armenian Question]] once for all, therefore permanently. Kamuran Gurun has released archival material from the minister of war that provides the aim of passing the law. In that letter Enver takes it as permanent and not temporary with the aim of fixing the Armenian ''problem'' once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian file: the myth of innocence exposed. By Kamuran Gurun. New York : St. Martin's Press, (1985), p.209&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is claimed that the debts of the evacuated population were to be completely canceled, and recurring tax debts (property tax) of the Armenians were to be postponed until their supposed return,&lt;ref&gt;Coding Office, no 54-A/268&lt;/ref&gt; the Armenian properties were seized by the government, sold or given to the Muslim residents or immigrants.&lt;ref name="Their Properties 2007 pp. 138"/&gt; A significant amount of money made from the sale of the seized properties was transferred and secured in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Armenia and the Near East, Fridtjof Nansen, G. Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial aspects ==
A fund was initiated with the law. The control of the fund was assigned to director Şükrü Bey, a directorate under the immigrants general office (Immigrant and Tribe Settling). He was accused of complicity during the courts-martial in the destruction of the Armenian population. Also considered to maintain the link between the Ittihadists and the Special Organization.

Also, the Ottoman government under the international agreements assigned within the capitulations, enabled fund transfers using the missionaries and consuls. Armenian immigrants from the United States sent funds, which were distributed to the Armenians under the knowledge of the government by these institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Coding Office, no 60/178&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[American Near East Relief Committee]]'', a relief organization for refugees in the Middle East, helped donate over $102 million to Armenians both during and after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Andrew. ''The Armenian Genocide''. Two Cats Productions, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

It has to be noted that the funds within the provinces aided the immigrants, whose money allocations were sent under provincial budgets depending on the condition of needs.

Those are contradicted by the Ottoman barring access to its own allies relief to the starving Armenian population.

== Repeal of the law ==
The law was repealed on February 21, 1916,&lt;ref&gt;Coding Office, no 57/273; no 58/124; no 58/161; no 59/123; no 60/190&lt;/ref&gt; with an order sent to all Ottoman provinces, while the destruction of the Armenian population continued.

[[File:Rajasthanthali.jpg|thumb|A vegetarian [[thali]] from [[Rajasthan]], India. Since many [[Indian religions]] promote vegetarianism, [[Indian cuisine]] offers a wide variety of vegetarian delicacies]]

Vegetarianism is strongly linked with a number of religions that originated in ancient India ([[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]]). In Jainism, [[vegetarianism]] is mandatory for everyone; in Hinduism and [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], it is advocated by some influential scriptures and religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Tähtinen| first = Unto| title = Ahimsa: Non-Violence in Indian Tradition | year = 1976| location = London| pages = 107–111| isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Walters| first = Kerry S.| authorlink = Kerry S.

Consequently, [[India]] is home to more vegetarians than any other country.

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jain vegetarianism}}
[[File:Jain Vegetarianism Illustration.jpg|thumb|The food choices of Jains are based on the value of [[Ahimsa|Ahimsa (non-violence)]], and this makes the Jains to prefer food that inflict the least amount of violence]]
Vegetarianism in [[Jainism]] is based on the principle of nonviolence ([[ahimsa]], literally "non-injuring"). Vegetarianism is considered mandatory for everyone. Jains are either [[Lacto-vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarians]] or [[Veganism|vegans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dietary code of practice amongst Jains|url=http://www.ivu.org/congress/2000/jainism.html|website=International Vegetarian Union (IVU)|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No use or consumption of products obtained from dead animals is allowed. Moreover, Jains try to avoid unnecessary injury to plants and ''suksma jiva'' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] for ''subtle life forms''; minuscule organisms). The goal is to cause as little violence to living things as possible, hence they avoid eating roots, tubers such as potatoes, garlic and anything that involves uprooting (and thus eventually killing) a plant to obtain food.

Every act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as violence (''hinsa''), which creates harmful [[Karma in Jainism|karma]]. The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, James: ''Riches and Renunciation. Religion, economy, and society among the Jains'', Oxford 1995, p. 26-30, 191-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains consider nonviolence to be the most essential religious duty for everyone (ahinsā paramo dharmaḥ, a statement often inscribed on Jain temples). Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. A side effect of this strict discipline is the exercise of asceticism,&lt;ref name=asce&gt;Disclaimer: "The meaning of [[asceticism]] discourses is complex." The word, however, is frequently used in a derogatory way against the veg(etari)an movement. ''Characterizing veganism as asceticism'', pp. 141–142. In: {{cite journal|authors=Matthew Cole, Karen Morgan|title=Vegaphobia: derogatory discourses of veganism and the reproduction of speciesism in UK national newspapers|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|year=2011|volume=62|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01348.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01348.x/full|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is strongly encouraged in Jainism for lay people as well as for monks and nuns.

Jains do not practice animal sacrifice as they consider all sentient beings to be equal.

The principle of [[nonviolence]] ([[Ahimsa]]) applied to animals is connected with the intention to avoid negative [[Karma|karmic]] influences which result from violence. The suffering of all beings is believed to arise from craving and desire, conditioned by the karmic effects of both animal and human action. The violence of slaughtering animals for food, and its source in craving, reveal flesh eating as one mode in which humans enslave themselves to suffering.&lt;ref name="Walters, Kerry S 2001. pp. 41, 42"&gt;Walters, Kerry S. and Portmess, Lisa. Religious Vegetarianism: From Hesiod to the Dalai Lama. State University of New York Press. New York, 2001. pp. 41, 42, 61, 62, 187, 191. {{ISBN|0-7914-4972-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism holds that such influences affect the person who permits the slaughter of an animal, the person who kills it, the person who cuts it up, the person who buys or sells meat, the person who cooks it, the person who serves it up, and the person who eats it. They must all be considered the slayers of the animal.&lt;ref name="Walters, Kerry S 2001. pp. 41, 42"/&gt;  The question of religious duties towards the animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence (''himsa'') against them is discussed in detail in Hindu scriptures and religious law books.

Hindu scriptures belong or refer to the [[Vedic period]] which lasted till about 500 BCE according to the chronological division by modern historians. In the [[historical Vedic religion]], the predecessor of Hinduism, meat eating was not banned in principle, but was restricted by specific rules. Several highly authoritative scriptures bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the [[Mahabharata]] (3.199.11-12;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199 is 3.207 according to another count.&lt;/ref&gt; 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the [[Bhagavata Purana]] (11.5.13-14), and the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (8.15.1). For instance, many Hindus point to the [[Mahabharata]]'s maxim that "Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching,"&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.116.37-41&lt;/ref&gt; as advocating a vegetarian diet. The [[Mahabharata]] also states that adharma (sin) was born when creatures started to devour one another from want of food and that adharma always destroys every creature "&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata section LXVI"&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reflected in the [[Manu Smriti]] (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu law book ([[Dharmaśāstra]]). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating.

The Mahabharata (12.260;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260]. Mahabharata 12.260 s 12.268 according to another count.&lt;/ref&gt; 13.115-116; 14.28) and the Manu Smriti (5.27-55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter and subsequent consumption of the meat. In the Mahabharata both meat eaters and vegetarians present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Apart from the debates about domestic animals, there is also a long discourse by a hunter in defence of hunting and meat eating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199]. Mahabharata 3.199 is 3.207 according to another count.&lt;/ref&gt; These texts show that both ritual slaughter and hunting were challenged by advocates of universal non-violence and their acceptability was doubtful and a matter of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manu Smriti) and pp. 585-597 (for the Mahabharata).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Current situation====
In modern India the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community or caste and according to regional traditions. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and [[dairy product]]s, so they are [[Lacto vegetarianism|lacto-vegetarians]].

According to a survey of 2006, vegetarianism is weak in coastal states and strong in landlocked northern and western states and among [[Brahmin]]s in general, 55 percent of whom are vegetarians.&lt;ref name=Food_habits_of_a_nation&gt;{{cite news | author = Yadav, Y.|author2=Kumar, S|title =  The food habits of a nation| url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/14/stories/2006081403771200.htm | work = The Hindu | date = August 14, 2006|accessdate = 17 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a study from ''[[Economic and Political Weekly]]'' shows that in facts only a third of the upper-caste Indians could be vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43581122&lt;/ref&gt;

Many coastal inhabitants are [[pescetarianism|fish eaters]]. In particular [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Hindus have romanticized fishermen and the consumption of fish through poetry, literature and music.

[[Hindus]] who eat [[meat]] are encouraged to eat [[Jhatka]] meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/seta/2004/10/21/stories/2004102100111600.htm The Hindu - Changes in the Indian menu over the ages]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Veena|title=The Oxford India companion to sociology and social anthropology, Volume 1 |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0195645820|accessdate=13 June 2010|volume=1|date=13 February 2003|publisher=OUP India |isbn=0-19-564582-0|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual sacrifice normally forms part of a festival to honour a Hindu god.

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}
[[File:Korea-Seoul-Insadong-Sanchon-02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Buddhist influenced Korean vegetarian side dishes.]]
The [[Five Precepts|First Precept]] prohibits [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] from killing people or animals.&lt;ref name="precepts"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://web.singnet.com.sg/~alankhoo/Precepts.htm#Killing |title=Leading a Buddhist Life and the Five Precepts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter of whether this forbids Buddhists from eating meat has long been a matter of debate.

The first Buddhist monks and nuns were forbidden from growing, storing, or cooking their own food. They relied entirely on the generosity of alms to feed themselves, and were not allowed to accept money to buy their own food.&lt;ref name="dharma"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma3/meat.html |title=What the Buddha Said About Eating Meat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mahaparinirvana"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nirvanasutra.net/nirvanasutrac.htm |title=Nirvana Sutra: Appreciation of the "Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra" |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They could not make special dietary requests, and had to accept whatever food alms givers had available, including meat.&lt;ref name="dharma" /&gt; Monks and nuns of the [[Theravada]] school of Buddhism, which predominates in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, and Laos, still follow these strictures today.

These strictures were relaxed in China, Korea, Japan, and other countries that follow [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, where monasteries were in remote mountain areas and the distance to the nearest towns made daily alms rounds impractical. There, Buddhist monks and nuns could cultivate their own crops, store their own harvests, cook their own meals, and accept money to buy anything else they needed in terms of food in the market.

According to the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], when [[Devadatta]] urged him to make complete abstinence from meat compulsory, the Buddha refused, maintaining that "monks would have to accept whatever they found in their begging bowls, including meat, provided that they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Phelps|2004|pp=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were prohibitions on specific kinds of meat: meat from humans, meat from royal animals such as elephants or horses, meat from dogs, and meat from dangerous animals like snakes, lions, tigers, panthers, bears and hyenas.&lt;ref name="dharma" /&gt;

On the other hand, certain [[Mahayana sutras]] strongly denounce the eating of meat. According to the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], the Buddha revoked this permission to eat meat and warned of a dark age when false monks would claim that they were allowed meat.&lt;ref name="mahaparinirvana" /&gt; In the [[Lankavatara Sutra]], a disciple of the Buddha named Mahamati asks "[Y]ou teach a doctrine that is flavoured with compassion. It is the teaching of the perfect Buddhas. And yet we eat meat nonetheless; we have not put an end to it."&lt;ref name="shabkar"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shabkar.org/scripture/sutras/lankavatara_sutra1.htm |title=Lankavatara Sutra – The Faults of Eating Meat}}&lt;/ref&gt; An entire chapter is devoted to the Buddha's response, wherein he lists a litany of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional reasons why meat eating should be abjured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Phelps|2004|pp=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to {{Harvcoltxt|Suzuki|2004|pp=211}}, this chapter on meat eating is a "later addition to the text....It is quite likely that meat-eating was practiced more or less among the earlier Buddhists, which was made a subject of severe criticism by their opponents. The Buddhists at the time of the ''Laṅkāvatāra'' did not like it, hence this addition in which an apologetic tone is noticeable."&lt;ref name="suzuki"&gt;{{cite book | last =Suzuki | first =D.

A Cultural Critique of Chan/Zen Buddhism | place =Princeton, New Jersey | publisher =Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the same sutra which records his retraction of permission to eat meat, the Buddha explicitly identifies as "beautiful foods" honey, milk, and cream, all of which are eschewed by vegans.&lt;ref name="mahaparinirvana" /&gt;

In the modern Buddhist world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In China and [[Vietnam]], monks typically eat no meat, with other [[Buddhist cuisine|restrictions]] as well. In [[Japan]] or [[Korea]] some schools do not eat meat, while most do. Theravadins in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Southeast Asia]] do not practice vegetarianism. All Buddhists however, including monks, are allowed to practice vegetarianism if they wish to do so. {{Harvcoltxt|Phelps|2004|pp=147}} states that "There are no accurate statistics, but I would guess—and it is only a guess—that worldwide about half of all Buddhists are vegetarian".

Singh, Manohar, Delhi {{ISBN|978-81-7304-058-0}}: ''Throughout Sikh history, there have been movements or subsects of Sikhism which have espoused vegetarianism. I think there is no basis for such dogma or practice in Sikhism. Certainly Sikhs do not think that a vegetarian's achievements in spirituality are easier or higher. It is surprising to see that vegetarianism is such an important facet of Hindu practice in light of the fact that animal sacrifice was a significant and much valued Hindu Vedic ritual for ages. Guru Nanak in his writings clearly rejected both sides of the arguments—on the virtues of vegetarianism or meat eating—as banal and so much nonsense, nor did he accept the idea that a cow was somehow more sacred than a horse or a chicken. He also refused to be drawn into a contention on the differences between flesh and greens, for instance. History tells us that to impart this message, Nanak cooked meat at an important Hindu festival in Kurukshetra. Having cooked it he certainly did not waste it, but probably served it to his followers and ate himself. History is quite clear that Guru Hargobind and Guru Gobind Singh were accomplished and avid hunters. The game was cooked and put to good use, to throw it away would have been an awful waste''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Guru Granth Sahib, An Analytical Study'' by Surindar Singh Kohli, Singh Bros.

Kabir far from defying Brahmanical tradition as to the eating of meat, would not permit so much, as the plucking of a flower (G.G.S. p. 479), whereas Nanak deemed all such scruples to be superstitions, Kabir held the doctrine of Ahinsa or the non-destruction of life, which extended even to that of flowers. The Sikh Gurus, on the contrary, allowed and even encouraged, the use of animal flesh as food. Nanak has exposed this Ahinsa superstition in Asa Ki War (G.G.S. p. 472) and Malar Ke War (G.G.S. p. 1288)''&lt;/ref&gt; etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhwomen.com/Community/Volunteer/langar.htm "Langar,"] at [http://www.sikhwomen.com/ http://www.sikhwomen.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Passages from the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that fools argue over this issue.

On the views that eating vegetation would be eating flesh, first Sikh [[Guru Nanak]] states:

{{Quote|ਪਾਂਡੇ ਤੂ ਜਾਣੈ ਹੀ ਨਾਹੀ ਕਿਥਹੁ ਮਾਸੁ ਉਪੰਨਾ ॥ ਤੋਇਅਹੁ ਅੰਨੁ ਕਮਾਦੁ ਕਪਾਹਾਂ ਤੋਇਅਹੁ ਤ੍ਰਿਭਵਣੁ ਗੰਨਾ ॥

[[Judaic]], [[Christian]], and [[Muslim]] traditions ([[Abrahamic religion]]s) all have strong connections to the Biblical ideal of the [[Garden of Eden]],&lt;ref&gt;Eric Baratay, l'anthropocentrisme du christianisme occidental, Si les lions pouvaient parler, essais sur la condition animale, sous la direction de Boris Cyrulnik, Gallimard, {{ISBN|2-07-073709-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes references to a herbivore diet.&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Genesis|1:29-31}}, {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9}}]&lt;/sup&gt; However, only minorities within those populations actually practice and advocate such diets.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish vegetarianism}}

Medieval rabbis such as [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]] regarded vegetarianism as a moral ideal,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi J. David Bleich, https://web.archive.org/web/20120518014142/http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107, 
Reprinted with permission from "Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Volume III", KTAV Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of modern Jewish groups and Jewish religious and cultural authorities have promoted vegetarianism.  
Groups advocating for Jewish vegetarianism include [[Jewish Veg]], a contemporary [[grassroots]] organization promoting veganism as "God's ideal diet"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishveg.org/whats-jewish-about-being-veg What's Jewish About Being Veg]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the Shamayim V'Aretz Institute, which promotes a vegan diet in the Jewish community through animal welfare activism, kosher veganism, and Jewish spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shamayimvaretz.org|title=The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute {{!}} מכון שמים וארץ|website=The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute {{!}} מכון שמים וארץ|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source of advocacy for Jewish vegetarianism in Israel is [[Amirim]], a vegetarian [[moshav]] (village).&lt;ref&gt;http://amirim.com/village/en&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish Veg]] has named 75 contemporary rabbis who encourage veganism for all Jews, including [[Jonathan Wittenberg]], [[Daniel Sperber]], [[David Wolpe]], [[Nathan Lopes Cardozo]], [[Kerry Olitzky]], [[Shmuly Yanklowitz]], [[Aryeh Cohen]], [[Geoffrey Claussen]], [[Rami M. Shapiro]], [[David Rosen (rabbi)|David Rosen]], [[Raysh Weiss]], [[Elyse Goldstein]], [[Shefa Gold]], and [[Yonassan Gershom]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishveg.org/rabbinic-statement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=10149&amp;catId=1|title=74 Rabbis Urge Jewish Community to Go Vegan|work=VegNews.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rabbis who have promoted vegetarianism have included [[David Cohen (rabbi)|David Cohen]], [[Shlomo Goren]], [[Irving Greenberg]], [[Asa Keisar]], [[Jonathan Sacks]], [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]], and [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]].  Herzog has said:

:"A whole galaxy of central rabbinic and spiritual leaders... has been affirming vegetarianism as the ultimate meaning of Jewish moral teaching... Jews will move increasingly to vegetarianism out of their own deepening knowledge of what their tradition commands..."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Animals' Agenda'', Volume 9, Animal Rights Network, 1989, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JLNWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Herzog+%22Man's+carnivorous%22&amp;dq=Herzog+%22Man's+carnivorous%22&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SLjyUJDhD4vZsga14oCYCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ p. 32].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}

Other notable advocates of Jewish vegetarianism include [[Franz Kafka]], [[Roberta Kalechofsky]], [[Richard H. Schwartz]], [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], [[Jonathan Safran Foer]], and [[Aaron Gross|Aaron S. Gross]].

Jewish vegetarians often cite Jewish principles regarding [[Jewish ethics#Treatment of animals|animal welfare]], [[Jewish ethics#Environmental ethics|environmental ethics]], moral character, and [[Jewish ethics#Health and self-respect|health]] as reasons for adopting a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hazon.org/jewish-food-movement/food-choices/animal-welfare/|title=Animal Welfare - Hazon|work=Hazon|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mary L. Zamore, ed. The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic (New York, NY: CCAR Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Jews point to legal principles including [[Bal tashkhit]] (the law which prohibits waste) and [[Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim]] (the injunction not to cause ‘pain to living creatures’).&lt;ref name="Kalechofsky, Roberta 1995. pp. 16, 54"&gt;Kalechofsky, Roberta. Rabbis and Vegetarianism: An Evolving Tradition. Micah Publications. Massachusetts, 1995. pp. 16, 54, 55, 65, 66, 68, 70, 71. {{ISBN|0-916288-42-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jewish vegetarians are particularly concerned about cruel practices in [[factory farming|factory farms]] and high-speed, mechanized [[slaughterhouse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mary L. Zamore, ed. The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic (New York, NY: CCAR Press, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Safran Foer]] has raised these concerns in the short documentary film ''If This Is Kosher...'', responding to what he considers abuses within the kosher meat industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foer|first=Jonathan Safran|title=If This Is Kosher…|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7330038074290819722}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Jewish vegetarians have argued for vegetarianism on the grounds that Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat.  {{Bibleverse||Genesis|1:29}} states "And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit—to you it shall be for food." According to some classical [[meforshim|Jewish Bible commentators]] this means that God's original plan was for mankind to be vegan, and that God only later gave permission for man to eat meat because of man's weak nature.&lt;ref name="Schwartz, Richard H 2001. pp. 1, 12"&gt;Schwartz, Richard H. Judaism and Vegetarianism. Lantern Books. New York, 2001. pp. 1, 12, 16, 19, 188. {{ISBN|1-930051-24-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;· 

According to some opinions, the whole world will be vegetarian in the [[Jewish Messiah|Messianic]] era, and not eating meat brings the world closer to that ideal.&lt;ref name="Schwartz, Richard H 2001. pp. 1, 12"/&gt; As the ideal images of the Torah are vegetarian, one may see the laws of kashrut as actually designed to wean Jews away from meat eating and to move them toward the vegetarian ideal. For example, the rituals of kashrut may be seen as reminding Jews of the magnitude of what we do each time we kill a living being.&lt;ref name="Kalechofsky, Roberta 1995. pp. 16, 54"/&gt; 

While [[rabbi]]nic [[Judaism]] has generally discouraged ascetic practices&lt;ref name=asce/&gt;, Jewish vegetarians often point out that ethical vegetarianism is not an ascetic practice, as vegetarians do not desire to eat meat.  Rabbi [[Arthur Green]] has described Jewish vegetarianism as not an ascetic practice but "a life-affirming one," as "a vegetarian Judaism would be more whole in its ability to embrace the presence of God in all of Creation."&lt;ref&gt; Arthur Green, Seek My Face, Speak My Name: A Contemporary Jewish Theology (Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson, 1992), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian vegetarianism}}
[[File:Joseph Bates.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]], vegetarian and one of the founders of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].]]
Several Christian [[monasticism|monastic]] groups, including the [[Desert Fathers]], [[Trappist]]s, [[Benedictine]]s, [[Cistercian]]s and [[Carthusian]]s, all of the [[Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism|Orthodox monks]] and also [[Esoteric Christianity|Christian esoteric]] groups, such as the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]], have encouraged vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;Article ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/magen503.htm The Wisdom of the Vegetarian Diet]'' by The [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]] ([[Esoteric Christian]]s)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel]] (1910s), ''New Age Vegetarian Cookbook'', The Rosicrucian Fellowship (publisher), 492 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]], a Christian vegetarian sect founded by Reverend [[William Cowherd]] in 1809, were one of the philosophical forerunners of the [[Vegetarian Society]].&lt;ref name=desc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The Bible Christian Church|publisher=International Vegetarian Union|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=827|title=History of Vegetarianism - Early Ideas|publisher=The Vegetarian Society|accessdate=2008-07-08}}; Gregory, James (2007) ''Of Victorians and Vegetarians''. London: I. B. Tauris pp.&amp;nbsp;30–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101006496/|title=William Cowherd (brief information)|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups, such as [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], the [[Christian Vegetarian Association]] and [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], take a literal interpretation of the Biblical prophecies of [[Nonviolence#Respect|universal veg(etari)anism]]&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Genesis|1:29-1:31}}, {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-11:9}}, {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|65:25}}]&lt;/sup&gt; and encourage veg(etari)anism as preferred lifestyles or as a tool to [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|reject the commodity status of animals]] and the use of animal products for any purpose, although some of them say it is not required. Other groups point instead to allegedly explicit prophecies of temple sacrifices in the Messianic Kingdom, e.g. {{Bibleref|Ezekiel|46:12|NIV}}, where so-called peace offerings and so-called freewill offerings are said that will be offered, and {{Bibleref|Leviticus|7:15-20|NIV}} where it states that such offerings are eaten, what may contradict the very purpose of Jesus' purportedly sufficient [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].

Some Christian vegetarians, such as Keith Akers, argue that Jesus himself was a vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compassionatespirit.com/was_jesus_a_vegetarian.htm |title=Was Jesus a vegetarian?|author=Keith Akers |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akers argues that Jesus was influenced by the [[Essenes]], an  ascetic Jewish sect. The present academic consensus is that Jesus was not an Essene.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Richard Alan. Is God a Vegetarian?. Carus Publishing Company. Chicago, 1999. pp. 4, 7, 56, 117. {{ISBN|0-8126-9393-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no historical record of Jesus’ precise attitudes to animals, but there is a strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed, which Walters and Portmess argue can also refer to captive animals.&lt;ref name="Walters, Kerry S 2001. pp. 41, 42"/&gt;

Within [[Eastern Christianity]], Vegetarianism is practiced as part of [[fasting]] during the [[Great Lent]] (although shellfish and other non-vertebrate products are generally considered acceptable during some periods of this time); vegan fasting is particularly common in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox Churches]], such as the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]], which generally [[fasting and abstinence of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|fasts 210 days out of the year]].

===Islam===
{{See also|Islam and animals}}
[[Islam]] explicitly prohibits eating of some kinds of meat, especially pork. However, one of the most important Islamic celebrations, ''Eid ul-Adha'', involves animal sacrifices. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice a domestic animals (usually sheep, but also camels, cows, and goats). According to the Quran,&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-22/verse-28/ Quran Surah Al-Hajj ( Verse 28 )]&lt;/ref&gt; a large portion of the meat has to be given towards the poor and hungry, and every effort is to be made to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during days of feast like Eid-ul-Adha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-22/verse-36/ Quran Surah Al-Hajj ( Verse 36 )]&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Islamic orders are mainly vegetarian; many Sufis maintain a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Rastafari===
[[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] generally follow a diet called "[[I-tal]]", which eschews the eating of food that has been artificially preserved, flavoured, or chemically altered in any way. Some Rastafarians consider it to also forbid the eating of meat but the majority will not eat pork at the very least, considering it unclean.

===Bahá'í Faith===
While there are no dietary restrictions in the [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Diet |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society would gradually become vegetarian.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Esslemont, J.E. |authorlink = John Esslemont |year = 1980 |title = Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era |edition = 5th |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-160-4 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/o/BNE/bne-83.html.iso8859-1? }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = `Abdu'l-Bahá |editor = MacNutt |author-link = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1912 |publication-date = 1982 |title = The Promulgation of Universal Peace |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, US |isbn = 0-87743-172-8 |url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/PUP/pup-60.html.iso8859-1? }}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was somewhat contrary to compassion.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; While [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Extracts from The Writings Concerning Health, Healing, and Nutrition | url = http://bahai-library.com/compilation_health_healing_nutrition#III | accessdate = 25 May 2009 | author = The Research Department of the Universal House of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; both he and the [[Universal House of Justice]], the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish, but to be respectful of others beliefs.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

==Other religions==

===Manichaeism===
[[Manichaeism]] was a religion established by the Iranian named [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] during [[Sassanian empire]]. The religion prohibited slaughtering or eating animals &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/manicheism-1-general-survey&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Mazdakism]], a sect of Zoroastrianism, explicitly promoted vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/sects/mazdak.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The sect was founded by [[Mazdak]].

One of the main precepts in [[Zoroastrianism]] is respect and kindness towards all living things and condemnation of cruelty against animals{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The [[Shahnameh]] states that the evil king of Iran, Zohak was first taught eating meat by the evil one who came to him in the guise of a cook. This was the start of an age of great evil for Iran. Prior to this, in the Golden age of mankind in the days of the great Aryan Kings, man did not eat meat.

The Pahlavi scriptures state that in the final stages of the world, when the final Saviour Saoshyant arrives, man will become more spiritual and gradually give up meat eating.

Vegetarianism is stated to be the future state of the world in Pahlavi scriptures - Atrupat-e Emetan in Iran in Denkard Book VI requested all Zoroastrians to be vegetarians:

"ku.san enez a-on ku urwar xwarishn bawed shmah mardoman ku derziwishn bawed, ud az tan i gospand pahrezed, ce amar was, eg Ohrmaz i xwaday hay.yarih i gospand ray urwar was dad."

Meaning: They hold this also: Be plant eaters (urwar xwarishn) (i.e. vegetarian), O you, men, so that you may live long. Keep away from the body of cattle (tan i gospand), and  deeply  reckon that Ohrmazd, the Lord has created plants in great number for helping cattle (and men)."

===Nation of Islam===
The [[Nation of Islam]] promotes vegetarianism deeming it the "most healthful and virtuous way to eat".&lt;ref&gt;http://southernstudies.olemiss.edu/study-the-south/how-to-eat-to-live/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
In Chinese societies, "simple eating" (素食 [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]: sù shí) refers to a particular restricted diet associated with [[Taoism|Taoist]] monks, and sometimes practiced by members of the general population during Taoist festivals and fasting days. It is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism. Varying levels of abstinence among Taoists and Taoist-influenced people include veganism, veganism without root vegetables, lacto-ovo vegetarianism, and pescetarianism. Taoist vegetarians also tend to abstain from alcohol and pungent vegetables such as garlic and onions during lenten days. Non-vegetarian Taoists sometimes abstain from beef and water buffalo meat for many cultural reasons.

Vegetarianism in the Taoist tradition is similar to that of Lent in the Christian tradition. While highly religious people such as monks may be [[vegetarian]], [[vegan]] or [[pescetarian]] on a permanent basis, lay practitioners often eat vegetarian on the 1st (new moon), 8th, 14th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th and 30th days of the lunar calendar. In accordance with their Buddhist peers, and because many people are both Taoist and Buddhist, they often also eat lenten on the 15th day (full moon). Taoist vegetarianism is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism, however, its roots reach to pre-Buddhist times. Believers historically abstained from animal products and alcohol before practicing Confucian, Taoist and Chinese folk religion rites.

It is referred to by the English word "vegetarian"; however, though it rejects meat, eggs, and milk, this diet may include [[oyster]]s and oyster products or otherwise be pescetarian for some believers. Many lay Taoists who follow modern sects such as that of Yi Guan Dao or Master Ching Hai are vegan or strictly vegetarian. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Faithist/Oahspe ===
Oahspe (Meaning Sky, Earth and Spirit) is the doctrinal book of those who follow Faithism. The precepts for behavior can be found throughout the book which include" a herbivorous diet (vegan, vegetable food only), peaceful living (no warring or violence; pacifism), living a life of virtue, service to others, angelic assistance, spiritual communion, and communal living when it is feasible to do so. Freedom and responsibility are two themes reiterated throughout the text of Oahspe.

===Neopaganism===
There is no set teaching on vegetarianism within the diverse [[neopagan]] communities, however many do follow a vegetarian diet often connected to [[ecological]] concerns as well as the welfare and rights of animals. Vegetarian practitioners of [[Wicca]] will often see their standpoint as a natural extension of the [[Wiccan Rede]]. Organizations like SERV refer to the historic figures of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Iamblichus]] as sources for the Pagan view of vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.serv-online.org/Pagan-quotations.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s the publication [[Earth Religion News]], focused on articles related to neopaganism and vegetarianism, it was edited by the author [[Herman Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geraldgardner.com/archive/ern/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meher Baba's teachings===
The spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] recommended a vegetarian diet for his followers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meherbabadnyana.net/life_eternal/Book_Two/2_False_Beliefs.htm#03 "False Beliefs, Book Two: Meat Eating."] Retrieved 5 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; because he held that it helps one to avoid certain impurities: "Killing an animal for sport, pleasure or food means catching all its bad impressions, since the motive is selfish....Impressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because therein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more susceptible to lust and anger."&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1988). [http://www.ambppct.org/meherbaba/Book_Files/Sparks_Truth.pdf ''Sparks of the Truth: From the Dissertations of Meher Baba'']. Myrtle Beach: Sheriar Press. pp. 24-25. {{ISBN|0-913078-02-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creativity movement===
