==Background==
From the beginning of the [[2013 Shahbag protests|Shahbag protest]], bloggers came out on the streets to demand capital punishment of [[Abdul Quader Molla]], a war criminal of the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] and a leader of [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami]]. During the protests, a controversial author, pro-Shahbag blogger and online activist [[Sunnyur Rahman]], popularly known as 'Nastik Nobi' (Atheist Prophet) in the blog community, was stabbed on 7 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;

Afterwards, the government of Bangladesh started monitoring the blogosphere and sent letters to the Bengali blog authorities to terminate the alleged "anti-religious" blogs and to provide information about the alleged "anti-religious" bloggers.&lt;ref name=ifex-2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=monitoring_panel-1&gt;{{cite news|title=100,000 Bangladeshi Protestors Rallied To Demand The Execution of Atheist Bloggers|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/protestors-demanding-execution-of-atheist-bloggers-2013-4|accessdate=9 April 2013|date=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 1 April 2013, three bloggers were arrested by the detective branch (DB) police. Blogger Rasel Pervez, a prominent physicist and blogger and Mashiur Rahman Biplob were arrested on 1 April 2013 from their house. Subrata Adhikari Shuvo, who is a masters student of the Bengali department at the [[University of Dhaka]], was also arrested on the same day from his university dormitory.&lt;ref name=ifex-1&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Bangladeshi bloggers arrested for "blasphemous" posts|url=http://www.ifex.org/bangladesh/2013/04/04/bloggers_arrested/|accessdate=7 April 2013|newspaper=ifex|date=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

{{About|the act of adultery or extramarital sex|other uses|Adultery (disambiguation)|a broad overview|Religion and sexuality}}
{{Sex and the law}}
{{Family law}}
'''Adultery''' (from [[Latin]] ''adulterium'') is [[extramarital sex]] that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Although what [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] constitute adultery varies, as well as the social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, "Adultery" |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single act of sexual intercourse is generally sufficient to constitute adultery, and a more long-term sexual relationship is sometimes referred to as an [[affair]].

Historically, many cultures have considered adultery to be a very serious [[crime]]. Adultery often incurred severe punishment, usually for the woman and sometimes for the man, with penalties including [[capital punishment]], [[mutilation]], or [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=mt0TAAAAIAAJ |title=The doctrine and law of marriage, adultery, and divorce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such punishments have gradually fallen into disfavor, especially in [[Western countries]] from the 19th century. In most Western countries, adultery itself is no longer a criminal offense, but may still have legal consequences, particularly in [[divorce]] cases. For example, in fault-based [[family law]] jurisdictions, adultery almost always constitutes a [[grounds for divorce|ground for divorce]] and may be a factor in [[property settlement]], the [[child custody|custody]] of children, the denial of [[alimony]], etc. Adultery is not a ground for divorce in jurisdictions which have adopted a [[no-fault divorce]] model. In some societies and among certain religious adherents, adultery may affect the [[social status]] of those involved, and may result in social [[ostracize|ostracism]].

In countries where adultery is a criminal offense, punishments range from [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s to [[caning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/aceh-woman-gangraped-by-vigilantes-for-alleged-adultery-now-to-be-flogged-20140507-zr5x3.html|title=Aceh woman, gang-raped by vigilantes for alleged adultery, now to be flogged|work=The Age|date=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even capital punishment. Since the 20th century, criminal laws against adultery have become controversial, with international organizations calling for their abolition, especially in the light of several high-profile [[stoning]] cases that have occurred in some countries. The head of the United Nations expert body charged with identifying ways to eliminate laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to them in terms of implementation or impact, [[Kamala Chandrakirana]], has stated that: "Adultery must not be classified as a criminal offence at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/10/adultery-laws-unfairly-target-women-u-n-says/ |title=IPS – Adultery Laws Unfairly Target Women, U.N. Says &amp;#124; Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2012-10-24 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that: "Adultery as a criminal offence violates women’s human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&amp;LangID=E |title=DisplayNews |publisher=Ohchr.org |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Muslim countries that follow [[Sharia law]] for criminal justice, the punishment for adultery may be stoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/isl_adul2.htm |title=Punishment for adultery in Islam |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are fifteen&lt;ref name="Thomson Reuters Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation |url=http://www.trust.org/item/20130927160132-qt52c/ |title=INFOGRAPHIC: Stoning - where is it legal? |publisher=Trust.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; countries in which stoning is authorized as lawful punishment, though in recent times it has been legally carried out only in Iran and Somalia.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mic |url=http://mic.com/articles/68431/women-around-the-world-are-being-stoned-to-death-do-you-know-the-facts |title=Women Around the World Are Being Stoned to Death. Do You Know the Facts? |publisher=Mic |date=2013-10-16 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most countries that criminalize adultery are those where the dominant religion is Islam, and several [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n Christian-majority countries, but there are some notable exceptions to this rule, namely Philippines, Taiwan, and several U.S. states. In some jurisdictions, having sexual relations with the king's wife or the wife of his eldest son constitutes [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Treason Act 1351]] which still applies.&lt;/ref&gt; By analogy, in cultures which value and normally practice exclusive [[interpersonal relationship]]s, sexual relations with a person outside the relationship may also be described as [[infidelity]] or cheating, and is subject to sanction.

The term ''adultery'' refers to sexual acts between a married person and someone who is not that person's spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adultery |title=Adultery - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adultery |title=Adultery &amp;#124; Define Adultery at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/adultery |title=adultery - definition of adultery in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may arise in [[criminal law]] or in [[family law]]. For instance, in the United Kingdom, adultery is not a criminal offense, but is a [[grounds for divorce|ground for divorce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/divorce/grounds-for-divorce |title=Get a divorce |publisher=gov.uk |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the legal definition of adultery being "physical contact with an alien and unlawful organ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Limits: The Role of the Law in Bioethical Decision Making |last=Dworkin |first=Roger B. |year=1996 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-33075-8 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extramarital sexual acts not fitting this definition are not "adultery" though they may constitute "unreasonable behavior", also a ground of divorce.

The application of the term to the act appears to arise from the idea that "criminal intercourse with a married woman ... tended to adulterate the issue [children] of an innocent husband ... and to expose him to support and provide for another man's [children]".&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v. Murff'', 135 F. Supp. 907, 911 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "purity" of the children of a marriage is corrupted, and the inheritance is altered.

Some adultery laws differentiate based on the sex of the participants, and as a result such laws are often seen as discriminatory, and in some jurisdictions they have been struck down by courts, usually on the basis that they discriminated against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6528869.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Ugandan adultery law 'too sexist' |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

The term ''adultery'', rather than ''extramarital sex'', implies a moral condemnation of the act; as such it is usually not a neutral term because it carries an implied judgment that the act is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Blackwell Publishing &lt;!--not John Wiley &amp; Sons it seems, better?--&gt;| doi=10.1002/9781444367072.wbiee372|chapter=Adultery|title=International Encyclopedia of Ethics|year=2013|last1=Brake|first1=Elizabeth|isbn=9781405186414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery refers to sexual relations which are not officially legitimized; for example it does not refer to having sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the case of [[polygamy]] (when a man is married to more than one wife at a time, called [[polygyny]]; or when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, called [[polyandry]]).

==Definitions and legal constructs==
[[File:Anne boleyn.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Anne Boleyn]] was found guilty of adultery and treason and executed in 1536. There is controversy among historians as to whether she had actually committed adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/clips/zdbxfg8 |title=KS3 History - Was Anne Boleyn guilty of adultery? |publisher=BBC |date=2013-05-15 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Jules Arsène Garnier - Le supplice des adultères.jpg|thumb|200px|''Le supplice des adultères'', by Jules Arsène Garnier, showing two adulterers being punished]]
In the traditional English [[common law]], adultery was a [[felony]]. Although the legal definition of ''adultery'' differs in nearly every legal system, the common theme is [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]] outside of marriage, in one form or another.

Traditionally, many cultures, particularly [[Latin American]] ones, had strong [[double standards]] regarding male and female adultery, with the latter being seen as a much more serious violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19690828&amp;id=zD0aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OSgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7328,4648572|title=The Milwaukee Journal - Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, edited by Jose C. Moya, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Tranquility and Order: Family and Community on Mexico's Northern Frontier, 1800–1850, by Laura M. Shelton, pp. 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery involving a married woman and a man other than her husband was considered a very serious crime. In 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt stated that a man having sexual relations with another man's wife was "the highest invasion of property" and claimed, in regard to the aggrieved husband, that "a man cannot receive a higher provocation" (in a case of murder or manslaughter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=0PLYXR2x0n0C }} |title=Judging Evil: Rethinking the Law of Murder and Manslaughter |author=Samuel H. Pillsbury |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Encyclopédie|Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert]]'', Vol. 1 (1751), also equated adultery to [[theft]] writing that, "adultery is, after homicide, the most punishable of all crimes, because it is the most cruel of all thefts, and an outrage capable of inciting murders and the most deplorable excesses."&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.328 |title=Adultery |journal=Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d'Alembert - Collaborative Translation Project |date=2009-04-18 |accessdate=2015-02-26|last1=Denis Diderot (Biography) |first1=François-Vincent Toussaint (Biography) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal definitions of adultery vary. For example, [[New York (state)|New York]] defines an adulterer as a person who "engages in [[sexual intercourse]] with another person at a time when he has a living spouse, or the other person has a living spouse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[common-law]] countries, adultery was also known as ''[[criminal conversation]].'' This became the name of the civil [[tort]] arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse's injury.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', 4th ed. 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal conversation was usually referred to by lawyers as ''crim. con.'', and was abolished in [[England]] in 1857, and the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1976. Another tort, [[alienation of affection]], arises when one spouse deserts the other for a third person.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'', 4th ed. 1957, citing ''Young v. Young'', 236 Ala. 627, 184 So. 187. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This act was also known as desertion, which was often a crime as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or alienation of affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |title=Criminal Conversation: North Carolina Laws and Defense |publisher=Haas McNeil &amp; Associates, P.A. |accessdate=2010-07-12 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080604043419/http://www.carolinafamilylaw.com/criminal_conversation.html |archivedate = 2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, six states still maintain this tort.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wayne Drash, CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/LIVING/12/08/cheating.spouses.lawsuits/ |title=Beware cheaters: Your lover's spouse can sue you - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ilga.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2019&amp;ChapterID=57|title=740 ILCS 5/  Alienation of Affections Abolition Act.|website=www.ilga.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A marriage in which both spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is sometimes referred to as an [[open marriage]] or the [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging]] lifestyle. [[Polyamory]], meaning the practice, desire, or acceptance of intimate relationships that are not exclusive with respect to other sexual or intimate relationships, with knowledge and consent of everyone involved, sometimes involves such marriages. Swinging and open marriages are both a form of [[non-monogamy]], and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as objectionable. However, irrespective of the stated views of the partners, extra-marital relations could still be considered a crime in some legal jurisdictions which criminalize adultery.

In Canada, though the written definition in the ''[[Divorce Act (Canada)|Divorce Act]]'' refers to extramarital relations with someone of the opposite sex, a [[British Columbia]] judge used the ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'' in a 2005 case to grant a woman a divorce from her husband who had cheated on her with another man, which the judge felt was equal reasoning to dissolve the union.

In the United Kingdom, case law restricts the definition of adultery to penetrative sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, no matter the gender of the spouses in the marriage, although infidelity with a person of the same gender can be grounds for a divorce as unreasonable behavior; this situation was discussed at length during debates on the [[Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction= | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/lhan31.pdf |title=The Parliamentary Debates| house=House of Lords | date=8–9 July 2013 |speaker=[[Tina Stowell, Baroness Stowell of Beeston]]|volume=747|no=31|column_start=145|column_end=147 |position=Lords Spokesperson for [[Minister for Women and Equalities|Women and Equalities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, [[Adultery law in India|adultery]] is the sexual intercourse of a man with a married woman without the consent of her husband when such sexual intercourse does not amount to rape. It was a non-cognizable, non-bailable criminal offence, until the relevant law was overturned by the Supreme Court of India on 27 September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abplive.in/india-news/adultery-can-be-treated-as-civil-wrong-but-not-criminal-supreme-court-760349|title=Supreme Court quashes Section 497, says 'Adultery not a criminal offence'|last=Bureau|first=ABP News|access-date=2018-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==
Punishments for adultery vary from place to place. Where adultery is illegal, the punishment varies from fines (for example in the US state of [[Rhode Island]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/rhode-island/2012/title-11/chapter-11-6/chapter-11-6-2/|title=2012 Rhode Island General Laws :: Title 11 - Criminal Offenses :: Chapter 11-6 - Bigamy and Adultery :: Chapter 11-6-2 - Adultery.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to caning in parts of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/150-women-face-adultery-flogging-on-maldives-1757150.html|title=150 women face adultery flogging on Maldives|publisher=|date=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/02/17/malaysia.adultery.caning/index.html|title=3 women caned in Malaysia for adultery - CNN.com|first=By  Joe Sterling|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are fifteen&lt;ref name="Thomson Reuters Foundation"/&gt; countries in which [[stoning]] is authorized as lawful punishment, although in recent times it has been legally enforced only in Iran and Somalia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Most stoning cases are the result of [[mob violence]], and while technically illegal, no action is usually taken against perpetrators. Sometimes such stonings are ordered by informal village leaders who have ''de facto'' power in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/04/asia/afghanistan-taliban-woman-stoning/index.html|title=Afghan woman stoned to death over adultery accusation - CNN|first=Jethro Mullen and Masoud Popalzai|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adultery may have consequences under [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] even in countries where it is not outlawed by the [[criminal law]]. For instance it may constitute ''fault'' in countries where the [[divorce law]] is [[Divorce#At-fault divorce|fault based]] or it may be a ground for [[tort]].

In some societies the law punishes the "intruder", rather than the adulterous spouse. For instance art 266 of the Penal Code of South Sudan reads: "Whoever,  has  consensual  sexual  intercourse  with  a  man  or woman who is and whom he or she has reason to believe to be the spouse of another person, commits the offence of adultery [...]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ss/ss014en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, under the [[adultery law in India]] (Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, until overturned by the Supreme Court in 2018) it was a criminal offense for a man to have consensual sexual intercourse with a married woman, without the consent of her husband (no party was criminally punished in case of adultery between a married man and an unmarried woman).

==Legal issues regarding paternity==
{{Further|Paternity (law)|Legitimacy (family law)}}
[[File:Jana2Navarra hlava.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|[[Joan II of Navarre]]{{snd}}her paternity and succession rights were disputed her whole life because her mother [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] was claimed to have committed adultery.]]
Historically, paternity of children born out of adultery has been seen as a major issue. Modern advances such as reliable [[contraception]] and [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] have changed the situation (in Western countries). Most countries nevertheless have a legal presumption that a woman's husband is the father of her children who were born during that marriage. Although this is often merely a [[rebuttable presumption]], many jurisdictions have laws which restrict the possibility of legal rebuttal (for instance by creating a legal time limit during which paternity may be challenged{{snd}}such as a certain number of years from the birth of the child).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biojuris.com/natural/3-2-0.html |title=Natural Selection in Family Law |publisher=Biojuris.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing correct paternity may have major legal implications, for instance in regard to [[inheritance]].

Children born out of adultery suffered, until recently, adverse legal and social consequences. In [[France]], for instance, a law that stated that the inheritance rights of a child born under such circumstances were, on the part of the married parent, half of what they would have been under ordinary circumstances, remained in force until 2001, when France was forced to change it by a ruling of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) (and in 2013, the ECtHR also ruled that the new 2001 regulations must be also applied to children born ''before'' 2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng/pages/search.aspx?i=001-116716#{%22itemid%22:[%22001-116716%22]}|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been, in recent years, a trend of legally favoring the right to a relation between the child and its biological father, rather than preserving the appearances of the 'social' family. In 2010, the ECtHR ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him from seeing the children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/hof.nsf/d0cd2c2c444d8d94c12567c2002de990/db5e85a236de283dc1257803004974b7?OpenDocument ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226171503/http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/hof.nsf/d0cd2c2c444d8d94c12567c2002de990/db5e85a236de283dc1257803004974b7?OpenDocument |date=February 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greco-Roman world===
{{Further|Adultery in Classical Athens}}

In the [[Greco-Roman world]], there were stringent laws against adultery, but these applied to sexual intercourse with a married woman. In the early [[Roman Law]], the ''jus tori'' belonged to the husband. It was therefore not a crime against the wife for a husband to have sex with a slave or an unmarried woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01163a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Adultery|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dig., XLVIII, ad leg. Jul.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman husband often took advantage of his legal immunity. Thus we are told by the historian [[Spartianus]] that [[Verus (senator)|Verus]], the imperial colleague of [[Marcus Aurelius]], did not hesitate to declare to his reproaching wife: "Uxor enim dignitatis nomen est, non voluptatis." ('''Wife' connotes rank, not sexual pleasure'', or more literally "Wife is the name of dignity, not bliss") (Verus, V).

Later in Roman history, as William E.H. Lecky has shown, the idea that the husband owed a fidelity similar to that demanded of the wife must have gained ground, at least in theory. Lecky gathers from the [[legal maxim]] of [[Ulpian]]: "It seems most unfair for a man to require from a wife the chastity he does not himself practice".&lt;ref&gt;Codex Justin., Digest, XLVIII, 5–13; Lecky, History of European Morals, II, 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plutarch]], the lending of wives practiced among some people was also encouraged by [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]], though from a motive other than that which actuated the practice (Plutarch, Lycurgus, XXIX). The recognized license of the Greek husband may be seen in the following passage of the [[pseudo-Demosthenes|pseudo-Demosthenic]] ''[[Against Neaera|Oration Against Neaera]]'':

:''We keep mistresses for our pleasures, concubines for constant attendance, and wives to bear us legitimate children and to be our faithful housekeepers. Yet, because of the wrong done to the husband only, the Athenian lawgiver Solon allowed any man to kill an adulterer whom he had taken in the act.'' (Plutarch, Solon)

The Roman [[Lex Julia]], ''Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis'' (17 BC), punished adultery with banishment.&lt;ref name="UNRV History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrv.com/government/julianmarriage.php |title=The Julian marriage laws |publisher=Unrv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two guilty parties were sent to different islands ("dummodo in ''diversas'' insulas relegentur"), and part of their property was confiscated.&lt;ref name="UNRV History" /&gt; Fathers were permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery. Husbands could kill the partners under certain circumstances and were required to divorce adulterous wives.

===Abrahamic religions===
{{See also|Extramarital sex#Religions|Fornication#Religions}}

====Christianity====
{{Main|Thou shalt not commit adultery}}
[[File:Nathan and David.jpg|thumb|'Thou shalt not commit adultery' (Nathan confronts David); bronze bas-relief on the door of the [[La Madeleine, Paris]], [[Paris]].]]

The [[Hebrew Bible]] prohibits adultery in the Seventh Commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." ({{bibleverse||Exodus|20:12|HE}}). {{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|NIV}} prescribes [[capital punishment]] for adultery between a man and married woman:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Significantly, the penalty does not extend to sex by an unmarried woman and irrespective of the marital status of the man.

Furthermore, Deuteronomic code prescribes [[stoning]] not only for female [[extramarital sex]], but also for female [[premarital sex]] in the case where the woman lies about her virginity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, … and say, / I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid. / … But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: / Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die. ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter 22|Deut. 22:13-21]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It also prescribes the same for engaged women who lie with another man, under the premise that if she allows the action without protesting, this indicates willingness.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; / Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city. ([[Wikisource:Bible (King James)/Deuteronomy#Chapter 22|Deut. 22:23-24]]).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adultery is considered by Christians to be immoral and a [[sin]], based primarily on passages like {{bibleverse|Exodus|20:14|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:9–10|NIV}}. Although {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|6:11|NIV}} does say that "and that is what some of you were. But you were washed", it still acknowledges adultery to be immoral and a sin.

Some churches have interpreted adultery to include all sexual relationships outside of marriage, regardless of the marital status of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/adultery |title=Guide to the Scriptures: Adultery |publisher=lds.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]] ties [[fornication]] with breaking the [[Ten Commandments|sixth commandment]] in its [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - The sixth commandment |publisher=Vatican.va |date=29 October 1951 |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until a few decades ago, adultery was a criminal offense in many countries where the dominant religion is Christianity, especially in [[Roman Catholic]] countries (see also the section on [[Adultery#Europe|Europe]]). Adultery was decriminalized in [[Argentina]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="impowr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/current-legal-framework-adultery-argentina |title=Current Legal Framework: Adultery in Argentina |publisher=impowr.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Brazil]] in 2005;&lt;ref name="iwraw-ap.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwraw-ap.org/resources/pdf/BRAZIL_SHADOWREPORT_CEDAW_June,18%5B1%5D.pdf |title=BRAZIL AND COMPLIANCE WITH CEDAW |date=February 1, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201225023/http://www.iwraw-ap.org/resources/pdf/BRAZIL_SHADOWREPORT_CEDAW_June%2C18%5B1%5D.pdf |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in some predominantly Catholic countries, such as the Philippines, it remains illegal. The [[Book of Mormon]] also prohibits adultery. For instance, Abinadi cites the [[Ten Commandments]] when he accuses [[King Noah]]'s priests of sexual immorality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13.22?lang=eng#21|title=Mosiah 13:22|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Jesus Christ]] visits the Americas he reinforces the law and teaches them the higher law (also found in the [[New Testament]]):

:''Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.27?lang=eng#26|title=3 Nephi 12:27|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Book of Mormon]] [[List of Book of Mormon prophets|prophets]] and civil leaders often list adultery as an illegal activity along with murder, robbing, and stealing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/30.10?lang=eng|title=Alma 30:10|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
Adultery in Judaism is prohibited by the Seventh Commandment, "Thou shalt not commit adultery.". Adultery in traditional Judaism applies to both parties, but depends on the marital status of the woman (Lev. 20:10). Though the [[Torah]] prescribes the death penalty for adultery, the legal procedural requirements were very exacting and required the testimony of two eyewitnesses of good character for conviction. The defendant also must have been warned immediately before performing the act.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonidies, Book of the Commandments, Prohibition 392 and the note at the end of Prohibition 347, Hebrew translation and notes by Rabbi Joseph Kapach, Mossad Harav Kook, Jerusalem 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  A death sentence could be issued only during the period when the [[Holy Temple]] stood, and only so long as the [[Sanhedrin|Supreme Torah]] Court convened in its chamber within the Temple complex.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides Mishneh Torah: Laws of Sanhedrin 14:11&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, therefore, no death penalty applies.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: Tractate Ketuvoth 30a,b&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty for adultery was strangulation,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Bavli: Tractate Sanhedrin, folio 52b, towards the bottom&lt;/ref&gt; except in the case of a woman who was the daughter of a Kohain (Aaronic priestly caste), which was specifically mentioned by Scripture by the death penalty of burning (pouring molten lead down the throat).&lt;ref&gt;Lev. 21:9&lt;/ref&gt; Ipso facto, there never was mentioned in Pharisaic or Rabbinic Judaism sources a punishment of stoning for adulterers as mentioned in John 8.

At the civil level, however, [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (halakha) forbids a man to continue living with an adulterous wife, and he is obliged to divorce her. Also, an adulteress is not permitted to marry the adulterer, but, to avoid any doubt as to her status as being free to marry another or that of her children, many authorities say he must give her a divorce as if they were married.&lt;ref&gt;The Jewish Way in Love &amp; Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper &amp; Row, San Francisco,1980&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Judaism, the [[Seven laws of Noah]] apply to all of humankind; these laws prohibit adultery with another man's wife.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Mishneh Torah]], Judges, Laws of Kings and Wars, Chapter 7 (Shabse Frankel edition, Jerusalem - B'nai B'rak, 5762 (c.2008, copyright 1998))&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ten Commandments]] were meant exclusively for Jewish males.&lt;ref name=coogan102/&gt; [[Michael Coogan]] writes that according to the text the wives are the property of their man, marriage meaning transfer of property (from father to husband),&lt;ref name=coogan102&gt;{{cite book|last=Coogan|first1=Michael|title=God and Sex.

Originally this commandment forbade male Israelites from having sexual intercourse with the wife of another Israelite; the prohibition did not extend to their own slaves. Sexual intercourse between an Israelite man, married or not, and a woman who was neither married or [[Engagement|betrothed]] was not considered adultery.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, R. F. (1992). "Ten Commandments." In D. N. Freedman (Ed.), ''The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary'' (Vol. 6, p. 386). New York: Doubleday&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband's possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/adultery.html|title=Adultery|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David]]'s sexual intercourse with [[Bathsheba]], the wife of Uriah, did not count as adultery.

====Islam====
{{Main|Zina (Arabic)}}
{{See also|Extramarital sex#Islam}}
[[Zina (Arabic)|Zina]] (زنا) is an Arabic term for illegal intercourse, premarital or extramarital. Various conditions and punishments have been attributed to adultery.

Under [[Sharia|Muslim law]], adultery in general is sexual intercourse by a person (whether man or woman) with someone to whom they are not married. Adultery is a violation of the marital contract and one of the major sins condemned by Allah in the [[Qur'an]]:

Qur'anic verses prohibiting adultery include:

: "Do not go near to adultery. Surely it is a shameful deed and evil, opening roads (to other evils)."{{Cite quran|17|32}}

: "Say, 'Verily, my Lord has prohibited the shameful deeds, be it open or secret, sins and trespasses against the truth and reason.'"{{Cite quran|7|33}}

Punishments are reserved to the legal authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://al-quran.info/#&amp;&amp;sura=24&amp;trans=no-einar_berg&amp;show=both,quran-uthmani&amp;format=rows&amp;ver=1.00 Online Qur'an Project Chapter 24].&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from [[slander]] and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can be convicted of adultery unless both of the accused also agree and give their confession under oath four times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asmasociety.org/perspectives/article_8.html |title=American Muslims need to speak out against violations of Islamic Shariah law |publisher=Asmasociety.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705191356/http://www.asmasociety.org///perspectives/article_8.html |archivedate=2010-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Muhammad, an unmarried person who commits adultery or fornication is punished by flogging 100 times; a married person will then be [[stoning|stoned]] to death.&lt;ref&gt;Hadith Muslim 17:4192. Also, see the following: Bukhari 6:60:79, Bukhari 83:37, Muslim 17:4196, Muslim 17:4206, Muslim 17:4209, Ibn Ishaq 970.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] found support for stoning as a punishment for adultery mostly in [[Arab countries]]; it was supported in [[Egypt]] (82% of respondents in favor of the punishment) and [[Jordan]] (70% in favor), as well as [[Pakistan]] (82% favor), whereas in [[Nigeria]] (56% in favor) and in [[Indonesia]] (42% in favor) opinion is more divided, perhaps due to diverging traditions and differing interpretations of Sharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah |title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah Retrieved 2011-06-02 |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date=2010-12-02 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu Sanskrit texts present a range of views on adultery, offering widely differing positions.&lt;ref name="Harlan161"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lawton2007p22&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clive Lawton|author2=Peggy Morgan|title=Ethical Issues in Six Religious Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e7QQAQAAIAAJ |year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2329-7|pages=22 }}, Quote: "The Sanskrit texts also take widely differing positions on adultery. Some see it as a minor offence: after menstruation and some penances, the woman is purified again. An adulterous husband may merely have to undergo some mild penances. But other texts advocate even the death penalty for either the man or the woman, depending on the caste status."&lt;/ref&gt; The hymn 4.5.5 of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' calls adultery as ''pāpa'' (evil, sin).&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=7 with footnote 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephanie Jamison|author2=Joel Brereton|title=The Rigveda: 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgzVAwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-972078-1|page=566}} Quote, [https://sa.wikisource.org/s/13s7 Sanskrit]: अभ्रातरो न योषणो व्यन्तः पतिरिपो न जनयो दुरेवाः । पापासः सन्तो अनृता असत्या इदं पदमजनता गभीरम् ॥५॥ Translation: "(You) pursuing (it) like brotherless maidens pursuing (men), (you) of evil ways like wives cheating (their) husbands, though being wicked, untruthful, untrue, you begot this deep track"&lt;/ref&gt; Other Vedic texts, states Rick Talbott, state adultery to be a sin, just like murder, incest, anger, evil thoughts and trickery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rick F.

According to Werner Menski, the Sanskrit texts take a "widely different positions on adultery", with some considering it a minor offense that can be addressed with penance, but others treat it as a severe offense that depending on the caste deserves the death penalty for the man or the woman.&lt;ref name=lawton2007p22/&gt; According to Ramanathan and Weerakoon, in Hinduism, the sexual matters are left to the judgment of those involved and not a matter to be imposed through law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kathryn S.

According to Carl Olsen, the classical Hindu society considered adultery as a sexual transgression but treated it with a degree of tolerance.&lt;ref name="Olson2007p261"/&gt; It is described as a minor transgression in ''Naradasmriti'' and other texts, one that a sincere penance could atone.&lt;ref name="Olson2007p261"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Olson|title=The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVWKClYq4TUC&amp;pg=PA261 |year=2007|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4068-9|pages=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Other Hindu texts present a more complex model of behavior and mythology where gods commit adultery for various reasons. For example, states Wendy Doniger, [[Krishna]] commits adultery and the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' justifies it as something to be expected when Vishnu took a human form, just like sages become uncontrolled.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988| publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2| pages=288–291 with footnotes 83, 89, 101–102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tracy Coleman, Radha and other gopis are indeed lovers of Krishna, but this is ''prema'' or "selfless, true love" and not carnal craving. In Hindu texts, this relationship between gopis and Krishna involves secret nightly rendezvous. Some texts state it to be divine adultery, others as a symbolism of spiritual dedication and religious value.&lt;ref name="Bose2018p117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy Coleman|editor=Mandakranta Bose|title=The Oxford History of Hinduism: The Goddess|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_tdDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-107968-9|pages=117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The example of Krishna's adulterous behavior has been used by Sahajiyas Hindus of Bengal to justify their own behavior that is contrary to the mainstream Hindu norm, according to Doniger.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"/&gt; Other Hindu texts state that Krishna's adultery is not a license for other men to do the same, in the same way that men should not drink poison just because Rudra-Shiva drank poison during the Samudra Manthan.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"/&gt; A similar teaching is found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Doniger.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p288"/&gt;

====Buddhism====
Buddhist texts such as [[Digha Nikaya|Digha Nikāya]] describe adultery as a form of sexual wrongdoing that is one link in a chain of immorality and misery. According to Wendy Doniger, this view of adultery as evil is postulated in early Buddhist texts as having originated from greed in a [[rebirth (Buddhism)|previous life]]. This idea combines Hindu and Buddhist thoughts then prevalent.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p33"/&gt; [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|Sentient beings]] without body, state the [[Tripitaka|canonical texts]], are reborn on earth due to their greed and craving, some people become beautiful and some ugly, some become men and some women. The ugly envy the beautiful and this triggers the ugly to commit adultery with the wives of the beautiful. Like in [[Hindu mythology]], states Doniger, Buddhist texts explain adultery as a result from sexual craving; it initiates a degenerative process.&lt;ref name="DonigerOFlaherty1988p33"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|title=The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sktbYRG_LO8C |year=1988|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass Publishers]] |isbn=978-81-208-0386-2|pages=33–34, n. 102–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism considers celibacy as the monastic ideal. For he who feels that he cannot live in celibacy, it recommends that he never commit adultery with another's wife.&lt;ref name="Harvey2000p71"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9CTSz3EVRpoC&amp;pg=PA71 |year=2000|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-55640-8|pages=71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engaging in sex outside of marriage, with the wife of another man, with a girl who is engaged to be married, or a girl protected by her relatives (father or brother), or extramarital sex with prostitutes, ultimately causes suffering to other human beings and oneself. It should be avoided, state the Buddhist canonical texts.&lt;ref name="Harvey2000p71"/&gt;

Buddhist Pali texts narrate legends where the Buddha explains the karmic consequences of adultery. For example, states Robert Goldman, one such story is of Thera Soreyya.&lt;ref name="Goldman1993p374"/&gt; Buddha states in the Soreyya story that "men who commit adultery suffer hell for hundreds of thousands of years after rebirth, then are reborn a hundred successive times as women on earth, must earn merit by "utter devotion to their husbands" in these lives, before they can be reborn again as men to pursue a monastic life and liberation from ''samsara''.&lt;ref name="Goldman1993p374"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Goldman | first=Robert P. | title=Transsexualism, Gender, and Anxiety in Traditional India | journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society | volume=113 | issue=3 | year=1993 | issn=0003-0279 | doi=10.2307/605387 | pages=377–381| jstor=605387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dharmasena|author2=R Obeyesekere|title=Portraits of Buddhist Women: Stories from the Saddharmaratnavaliya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvWA5wlIWnQC |year=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-5111-3|pages=213–218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some differences between the Buddhist texts and the Hindu texts on the identification and consequences of adultery. According to José Ignacio Cabezón, for example, the Hindu text ''Naradasmriti'' considers consensual extra-marital sex between a man and a woman in certain circumstances (such as if the husband has abandoned the woman) as not a punishable crime, but the Buddhist texts "nowhere exculpate" any adulterous relationship. The term adultery in ''Naradasmriti'' is broader in scope than the one in Buddhist sources. In the text, various acts such as secret meetings, exchange of messages and gifts, "inappropriate touching" and a false accusation of adultery, are deemed adulterous, while Buddhist texts do not recognize these acts under adultery.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2017p454"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Ignacio Cabezón|title=Sexuality in Classical South Asian Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCjhDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA454|year=2017|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-61429-368-2|pages=454–455, footnote 1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later texts such as the ''Dhammapada'', ''Pancasiksanusamsa Sutra'' and a few Mahayana sutras state that "heedless man who runs after other men's wife" acquire demerit, blame, discomfort and are reborn in hell.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2017p44"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Ignacio Cabezón|title=Sexuality in Classical South Asian Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCjhDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA454|year=2017|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-61429-368-2|pages=44–45, footnotes 79 and 80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Buddhist texts make no mention of legal punishments for adultery.&lt;ref name="Cabezon2017p454"/&gt;

In the tenth century, the Arab explorer [[Ibn Fadlan]] noted that adultery was unknown among the pagan [[Oghuz Turks]]. Ibn Fadlan writes that "adultery is unknown among them; but whomsoever they find by his conduct that he is an adulterer, they tear him in two. This comes about so: they bring together the branches of two trees, tie him to the branches and then let both trees go, so that he is torn in two."&lt;ref&gt;Aḥmad Ibn Faḍlān, Richard Nelson Frye, ''Ibn Fadlan's journey to Russia: a tenth-century traveler from Baghad to the Volga River'', Markus Wiener Publishers, 2005, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and its successor states, it has been [[high treason]] to engage in adultery with the King's wife, his eldest son's wife and his eldest unmarried daughter. The jurist Sir William Blackstone writes that "the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of bastardy, whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious." Adultery was a serious issue when it came to succession to the crown. [[Philip IV of France]] had all three of his daughters-in-law imprisoned, two ([[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret of Burgundy]] and [[Blanche of Burgundy]]) on the grounds of adultery and the third ([[Joan II, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]) for being aware of their adulterous behaviour. The two brothers accused of being lovers of the king's daughters-in-law were executed immediately after being arrested. The wife of Philip IV's eldest son bore a daughter, the future [[Joan II of Navarre]], whose paternity and succession rights were disputed all her life.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[christianization of Europe]] came to mean that, in theory, and unlike with the Romans, there was supposed to be a single sexual standard, where adultery was a sin and against the teachings of the church, regardless of the sex of those involved. In practice, however, the church seemed to have accepted the traditional double standard which punished the adultery of the wife more harshly than that of the husband.&lt;ref name="web.clark.edu"&gt;http://web.clark.edu/afisher/HIST252/lectures_text/Women%20in%20the%20Early%20Middle%20Ages.pdf, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150319072837/http://web.clark.edu/afisher/HIST252/lectures_text/Women%20in%20the%20Early%20Middle%20Ages.pdf Web archive link]&lt;/ref&gt; Among Germanic tribes, each tribe had its own laws for adultery, and many of them allowed the husband to "take the law in his hands" and commit acts of violence against a wife caught committing adultery.&lt;ref name="web.clark.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=BULLOUGH |first1=VERN L. |title=Medieval Concepts of Adultery |journal=Arthuriana |date=1997 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=5–15 |jstor=27869285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Ages, adultery in [[Vienna]] was punishable by death through [[impalement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.wdr.de/themen/archiv/stichtag/stichtag1344.html|title=22.

In [[Pakistan]], adultery is a crime under the [[Hudood Ordinance]], promulgated in 1979. The Ordinance sets a maximum penalty of [[capital punishment|death]]. The Ordinance has been particularly controversial because it requires a woman making an accusation of [[rape]] to provide extremely strong evidence to avoid being charged with adultery herself. A conviction for rape is only possible with evidence from no fewer than four witnesses. In recent years high-profile rape cases in Pakistan have given the Ordinance more exposure than similar laws in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2005/07/13/nat2.htm Hudood laws open to change in Pakistan], July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Similar laws exist in some other Muslim countries, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Brunei#Adultery|Brunei]].

In Southwest Asia, adultery has attracted severe [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], including [[death penalty]]. In some places, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], the method of punishment for adultery is [[stoning]] to death. Proving adultery under Muslim law can be a very difficult task as it requires the accuser to produce four eyewitnesses to the act of sexual intercourse, each of whom should have a good reputation for truthfulness and honesty. The criminal standards do not apply in the application of social and family consequences of adultery, where the standards of proof are not as exacting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=174|author=Juan Eduardo Campo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reasoning with God: Reclaiming Shari'ah in the Modern Age|author=Khaled Abou El Fadl|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Mackey]], author of ''The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom'', stated in 1987 that in Saudi Arabia, "unlike the tribal rights of a father to put to death a daughter who has violated her chastity, death sentences under Koranic law [for adultery] are extremely rare."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sandra Mackey|Mackey, Sandra]].

In the Philippines, the law differentiates based on the gender of the spouse. A wife can be charged with the crime of ''Adultery'' for having sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband, while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of ''Concubinage'', which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlp-law.com/blog/a-brief-discussion-on-infidelity-concubinage-adultery-and-bigamy/|title=A brief discussion on Infidelity, Concubinage, Adultery and Bigamy|work=Philippine e-Legal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently proposals to decriminalize adultery in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/363403/news/nation/gabriela-revives-proposal-to-decriminalize-adultery|title=Gabriela revives proposal to decriminalize adultery|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the last Western European countries to repeal their laws were [[Italy]] (1969), [[Malta]] (1973), [[Luxembourg]] (1974), [[France]] (1975), [[Spain]] (1978), [[Portugal]] (1982), [[Greece]] (1983), [[Belgium]] (1987), [[Switzerland]] (1989), and [[Austria]] (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=HartNkkDBssC |title=The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=XE97ryf8noAC |page=25 |title=Recent Social Trends in France, 1960–1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="European Transformation"&gt;{{Google books |id=QeuBc1ryQz8C |title=The European Transformation of Modern Turkey }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/1828371/Gouvernements_depuis_1848-version_2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182824/http://www.gouvernement.lu/1828371/Gouvernements_depuis_1848-version_2011.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.pt/destaque/jornal/aborto-nao-deve-ser-uma-prioridade-da-investigacao-criminal-209113|title=Aborto não deve ser uma prioridade da investigação criminal|author=Mariana Oliveira|work=PÚBLICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sirc.org/publik/motherhood_in_Spain.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D16108.php|title=Ehebruch|author=Anne-Lise Head-König / AL|work=hls-dhs-dss.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-04-15/news/decriminalisation-of-certain-drugs-on-governments-list-muscat-4640899072/|title=Next challenge is decriminalisation of drugs, PM maintains - The Malta Independent|work=independent.com.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[Communist]] countries adultery was not a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=_gsfAQAAIAAJ |title=The Cornell Law Quarterly, Volumul 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]] was an exception, where adultery was a crime until 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/summary-adultery-romania|title=Summary: Adultery in Romania|work=impowr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the crime of adultery had a narrow definition, excluding situations where the other spouse encouraged the act or when the act happened at a time the couple was living separate and apart;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/dictionar-juridic/adulter|title=Adulter|work=legeaz.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in practice prosecutions were extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.9am.ro/stiri-revista-presei/Social/1962/Dupa-20-de-ani-adulterul-dispare-din-Codul-penal.html | title=Dupa 20 de ani, adulterul dispare din Codul penal | accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkey]] adultery laws were held to be invalid in 1996/1998 because the law was deemed discriminatory as it differentiated between women and men. In 2004, there were proposals to introduce a gender-neutral adultery law. The plans were dropped, and it has been suggested that the objections from the European Union played a role.&lt;ref name="European Transformation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3654650.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkey signals U-turn on adultery | date=2004-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=pnGwP9-FhxYC |title=Deconstructing Sexuality in the Middle East: Challenges and Discourses }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 20th century, adultery was often punished harshly. In Scandinavia, in the 17th century, adultery and bigamy were subject to the [[death penalty]], although few people were actually executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=Ad0_J6T-YDQC |title=A Lutheran Plague: Murdering to Die in the Eighteenth Century }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of women who have been executed for adultery in Medieval and Early Modern Europe include [[Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria]] (in 1256), [[Agnese Visconti]] (in 1391), [[Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda]] (in 1418), [[Anne Boleyn]] (in 1536), and [[Catherine Howard]] (in 1542). The enforcement of adultery laws varied by jurisdiction. In England, the last execution for adultery is believed to have taken place in 1654, when a woman named Susan Bounty was [[hanged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/arts_at_oxford/121602_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411072534/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/arts_at_oxford/121602_1.html |archivedate=2014-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) has had the opportunity to rule in recent years on several cases involving the legitimacy of firing a person from their job due to adultery. These cases dealt with people working for religious organizations and raised the question of the balancing of the right of a person to respect for their private life (recognized in the EU) and the right of religious communities to be protected against undue interference by the State (recognized also in the EU). These situations must be analyzed with regard to their specific circumstances, in each case. The ECtHR had ruled both in favor of the religious organization (in the case of Obst) and in favor of the fired person (in the case of Schüth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/eng-press/pages/search.aspx?i=003-3272505-3650095#{%22itemid%22:[%22003-3272505-3650095%22]}|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
Until the 1990s, most Latin American countries had laws against adultery. Adultery has been decriminalized in most of these countries, including [[Paraguay]] (1990),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimahora.com/nuevo-codigo-elimino-delitos-machistas-y-discriminatorios-n212137.html|title=Nuevo Código eliminó delitos machistas y discriminatorios|work=ultimahora}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chile]] (1994),&lt;ref&gt;''Women and Democracy: Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe'', edited by Jane S.

===Australia===
Adultery is not a crime in Australia. Under federal law enacted in 1994, sexual conduct between consenting adults (18 years of age or older) is their private matter throughout Australia,&lt;ref name="act1994"&gt;{{cite web |title=''Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act'' 1994 |publisher=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/hrca1994297/s4.html |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; irrespective of marital status. Australian states and territories had previously repealed their respective adultery criminal laws. Australia changed to [[no-fault divorce]] in 1975, abolishing adultery as a ground for divorce.

In the last conviction for adultery in Massachusetts in 1983, it was held that the statute was constitutional and that "no fundamental personal privacy right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty guaranteed by the United States Constitution bars the criminal prosecution of such persons  [adulterers]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masscases.com/cases/sjc/389/389mass171.html |title=STOWELL, COMMONWEALTH vs., 389 Mass. 171 |publisher=Masscases.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massachusetts repealed its adultery law in 2018.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

In Utah, the adultery law only applies to the married party (the law states that "A married person commits adultery when he voluntarily has sexual intercourse with a person other than his spouse.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://law.justia.com/codes/utah/2011/title76/chapter7/section103.html |title=Section 103 Adultery. :: Chapter 7 Offenses Against the Family :: Title 76 Utah Criminal Code :: 2011 Utah Code :: Utah Code :: US Codes and Statutes :: US Law :: Justia |publisher=Law.justia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Utah also has a fornication law that applies to any unmarried person (also a class B misdemeanor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010400.htm |title=Utah State Legislature |publisher=Le.utah.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024438/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE76/htm/76_07_010400.htm |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Florida]] adultery ("Living in open adultery", Art 798.01) is illegal; while cohabitation of unmarried couples was decriminalized in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2016/0498|title=Senate Bill 498 (2016) - The Florida Senate|website=www.flsenate.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article70333202.html|title=After 148 years, shacking up is legal again in Florida|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[South Carolina]]'s adultery law came into spotlight in 2009, when then governor [[Mark Sanford]] admitted to his extramarital affair. He was not prosecuted for it; it is not clear whether South Carolina could prosecute a crime that occurred in another jurisdiction (Argentina in this case); furthermore, under South Carolina law adultery involves either "the living together and carnal intercourse with each other" or, if those involved do not live together "''habitual'' carnal intercourse with each other" which is more difficult to prove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t16c015.php |title=South Carolina Legislature Mobile |publisher=Scstatehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Alabama]] "A person commits adultery when he engages in sexual intercourse with another person who is not his spouse and lives in cohabitation with that other person when he or that other person is married." Adultery is a Class B misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.onecle.com/alabama/criminal-code/13A-13-2.html |title=Code of Alabama - Title 13A: Criminal Code - Section 13A-13-2 - Adultery |publisher=onecle.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028024438/http://law.onecle.com/alabama/criminal-code/13A-13-2.html |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since adultery is still a crime in Virginia, persons in divorce proceedings may use the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. Any criminal convictions for adultery can determine alimony and asset distribution. In 2016 there was a bill in Virginia to decriminalize adultery and make it only a civil offense, but the [[Virginia Senate]] did not advance the bill.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Liz.

In the [[U.S. military]], adultery is a potential [[court-martial]] offense.&lt;ref name="usmilitary.about.com"/&gt; The enforceability of adultery laws in the United States is unclear following [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions since 1965 relating to privacy and sexual intimacy of consenting adults.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g., [[Lawrence v. Texas]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, occasional prosecutions do occur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Turley]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62581-2004Sep4.html Of Lust and the Law], ''The Washington Post'', September 5, 2004, p.

Six U.S. states ([[Hawaii]], [[North Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Mexico]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Utah]]) allow the possibility of the [[tort]] action of [[alienation of affections]] (brought by a deserted spouse against a third party alleged to be responsible for the failure of the marriage).&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ilga.gov"/&gt; In a highly publicized case in 2010, a woman in North Carolina won a $9 million suit against her husband's [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/TheLaw/wife-wins-million-husbands-alleged-mistress/story?id=10151957|title=Wife Wins $9 Million From Husband's Alleged Mistress|author=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|date=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/03/22/Woman-wins-alienation-of-affection-case/UPI-83231269299182/|title=Woman wins 'alienation of affection' case|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of adultery laws===
{{See also|Alienation of affections#Criticism}}

====Political arguments====
Laws against adultery have been named as invasive and incompatible with principles of [[limited government]] (see Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate) chapter 2). Much of the criticism comes from [[libertarianism]], the consensus among whose adherents is that government must not intrude into daily personal lives and that such disputes are to be settled privately rather than [[Prosecution|prosecuted]] and [[Sanctions (law)|penalized]] by [[public entities]]. It is also argued that adultery laws are rooted in religious doctrines; which should not be the case for laws in a [[secular state]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Opponents of adultery laws regard them as painfully archaic, believing they represent sanctions reminiscent of nineteenth-century novels. They further object to the legislation of morality, especially a morality so steeped in religious doctrine. Support for the preservation of the adultery laws comes from religious groups and from political parties who feel quite independent of morality, that the government has reason to concern itself with the consensual sexual activity of its citizens … The crucial question is: when, if ever, is the government justified to interfere in consensual bedroom affairs?&lt;ref&gt;Weissler, Benjamin. "[http://yulr.org/government-and-the-bedroom/ Government and the Bedroom]." July 13, 2012. ''Yale Undergraduate Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a history of adultery laws being abused. In [[Somerset]], England, a somewhat common practice was for husbands to encourage their wives to seduce another man, who they would then [[Lawsuit|sue]] or [[blackmail]], under laws (for examples see [[Criminal conversation]]) prohibiting men from having sex with women married to other men.&lt;ref&gt;Ley, David. "[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/women-who-stray/201006/kinky-cuckolding-fetish-goes-mainstream Kinky Cuckolding Fetish Goes Mainstream]". ''Psychology Today''. June 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical context====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
Historically, in most cultures, laws against adultery were enacted only to prevent women—and not men—from having sexual relations with anyone other than their spouses,{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} since women were deemed their husbands' [[property]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} with adultery being often defined as sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man other than her husband.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Among many cultures the [[punishment|penalty]] was—and to this day still is, as noted [[Adultery#Violence|below]]—[[capital punishment]]. At the same time, men were free to maintain sexual relations with any women ([[polygyny]]) provided that the women did not already have husbands or "owners". Indeed, [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (ba`al), Hebrew for ''husband'', used throughout the [[Bible]], is synonymous with ''owner''. These laws were enacted in fear of [[cuckoldry]] and thus [[sexual jealousy]]. Many indigenous customs, such as [[female genital mutilation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/index.html "Female genital mutilation"], World Health Organization, February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[menstrual taboo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Strassman | first1 = B.I. | year = 1992 | title = The function of menstrual taboos among the Dogon: defense against cuckoldry? | doi = 10.1007/bf02692249 | pmid = 24222401 | journal = Human Nature | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 89–131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been theorized to have originated as preventive measures against cuckolding. This arrangement has been deplored by many modern intellectuals.

====Discrimination against women====
Opponents of adultery laws argue that these laws maintain social norms which justify violence, discrimination and oppression of women; in the form of state sanctioned forms of violence such as [[stoning]], [[flogging]] or [[hanging]] for adultery; or in the form of individual acts of violence committed against women by husbands or relatives, such as [[honor killings]], [[crimes of passion]], and beatings.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&amp; |title=Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice |work=ohchr.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306103836/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12672&amp; |archivedate=2015-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endvawnow.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html|title=Decriminalization of adultery and defenses|work=endvawnow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UN Women]] has called for the decriminalization of adultery.&lt;ref name="endvawnow.org"/&gt; A Joint Statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice in 2012, stated:&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice is deeply concerned at the criminalization and penalization of adultery whose enforcement leads to discrimination and [[violence against women]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerns exist that the existence of "adultery" as a criminal offense (and even in family law) can affect the criminal justice process in cases of domestic assaults and killings, in particular by mitigating [[murder]] to [[manslaughter]],&lt;ref&gt;With regard to the situation in the United States: "Moreover, setting to one side criminal prosecutions for adultery, there are numerous other ways in which the law deems adulterous conduct to be legally relevant. (...) Furthermore, a recognized "heat of passion" defense to a charge of murdering one’s spouse or paramour—which will typically reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter—is either finding them in the act of adultery, recently being informed of their act of adultery, or in some jurisdictions, having reason to believe that they committed adultery."&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise proving for partial or complete defenses in case of violence. These concerns have been officially raised by the Council of Europe and the UN in recent years. The [https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383 Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence] states that member states should: (...) "57. preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=280915&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383|title=Committee of Ministers - on the protection of women against violence|author=((Council of Europe, Committee of Ministers, Plenary))|work=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UN Women]] has also stated in regard to the defense of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] and other similar defenses that "laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of 'honour', adultery, or domestic assault or murder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html%29|title=Decriminalization of adultery and defenses|publisher=endvawnow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of limited resources of the criminal law enforcement====
An argument against the criminal status of adultery is that the resources of the law enforcement are limited, and that they should be used carefully; by investing them in the investigation and prosecution of adultery (which is very difficult) the curbing of serious violent crimes may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;''Suffolk law review, The Validity of Criminal Adultery Prohibitions After Lawrence v.Texas''; pg. 859 "Lack of enforcement suggests the prevailing view that police resources are better spent elsewhere."[http://suffolklawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/Viator_Note_Final.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The importance of consent as the basis of sexual offenses legislation====
Human rights organizations have stated that legislation on sexual crimes must be based on [[consent]], and must recognize consent as central, and not trivialize its importance; doing otherwise can lead to legal, social or ethical abuses. Amnesty International, when condemning stoning legislation that targets adultery, among other acts, has referred to "acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/afghanistan-reject-stoning-flogging-amputation-and-other-taliban-era-punish |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420193225/http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/afghanistan-reject-stoning-flogging-amputation-and-other-taliban-era-punish |archivedate=2014-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's Secretary General, said: "It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning [[child marriage]] and [[marital rape]] while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity{{snd}}even punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/sexual-and-reproductive-rights-under-threat-worldwide-2014-03-06|title=Sexual and reproductive rights under threat worldwide|work=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20140625235455/https://campaigns.amnesty.org/campaigns/my-body-my-rights My Body My Rights]'' campaign has condemned state control over individual sexual and reproductive decisions; stating "All over the world, people are coerced, criminalized and discriminated against, simply for making choices about their bodies and their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT35/001/2014/en|title=Document - Amnesty International - Amnesty International|work=amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===General===
For various reasons, most couples who marry do so with the expectation of [[Wiktionary:fidelity|fidelity]]. Adultery is often seen as a breach of trust and of the commitment that had been made during the act of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online, "Adultery" |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2011-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110427092349/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/6618/adultery| archivedate= 27 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adultery can be emotionally traumatic for both spouses and often results in divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About.com Divorce Support, "Why Does Infidelity Often Lead to Divorce?" |url=http://divorcesupport.about.com/b/2011/05/12/why-does-infidelity-often-lead-to-divorce.htm |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a new work, ''The New Rules'' by Dr Catherine Hakim, a British sociologist and author, refers to the United Kingdom arguing that a "sour and rigid English view" of [[Wiktionary:infidelity|infidelity]] as opposed to the 'wonderful French way' of male infidelity is condemning millions of people to live frustrated "celibate" lives with their spouses. She argues that there is such a thing as a "successful affair" in which both parties are happier but no one gets hurt: "Sex is no more a moral issue than eating a good meal," she writes. "The fact that we eat most meals at home with spouses and partners does not preclude eating out in restaurants to sample different cuisines and ambiences, with friends or colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mother Tongue |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9485796/Puritan-view-of-adultery-turns-Brits-into-caged-animals-says-academic.html |title=Puritan view of adultery turns Brits into 'caged animals' says academic |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2012-08-20|accessdate=2013-09-28 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery may lead to ostracization from certain religious or social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=6017|title=Library : Women as Guardians of Purity|work=catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adultery can also lead to feelings of guilt and jealousy in the person with whom the affair is being committed. In some cases, this "third person" may encourage divorce (either openly or subtly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs of a Cheating Husband |url=http://www.beatingjealousy.com/blog/?p=21 |publisher=Beatingjealousy.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905054412/http://www.beatingjealousy.com/blog/?p=21 |archivedate=2011-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the cheating spouse has hinted at divorce in order to continue the affair, the third person may feel deceived if that does not happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are You the Other Woman in an Affair |url=http://www.essortment.com/other-woman-affair-36524.html |publisher=Essortment.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326012438/http://www.essortment.com/other-woman-affair-36524.html |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Getting Over an Affair as the Other Woman |url=http://www.truthaboutdeception.com/community-features/ask-an-expert/questions-by-topic/infidelity/577-getting-over-an-affair-as-the-other-woman.html|publisher= Truthaboutdeception.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may simply withdraw with ongoing feelings of guilt, carry on an obsession with their lover, may choose to reveal the affair, or in rare cases commit violence or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amy Fisher|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|publisher=trutv.com|accessdate=2011-05-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125221246/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/young/amy_fisher/index.html|archive-date=2009-01-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is correlation, there is no evidence that divorces ''causes'' children to have struggles in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=nasponline.org, Divorce: A Parents' Guide for Supporting Children |url=http://www.nasponline.org/resources/parenting/divorce_ho.aspx|publisher= nasponline.org |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If adultery leads to divorce, it also carries higher financial burdens.&lt;ref name="divorcehq.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=divorcehq.com, "Comparison of the Average Cost of Divorce Fees" |url=http://www.divorcehq.com/articles/comparisonfees.shtml|publisher= divorcehq.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, living expenses and taxes are generally cheaper for married couples than for divorced couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=attorneys.com, "The Hidden Costs of Divorce" |url=http://www.attorneys.com/legal_center/articles/divorce/s/c/the_hidden_costs_of_divorce:_don't_overlook_these_expenses/ |publisher=attorneys.com |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703022300/http://www.attorneys.com/legal_center/articles/divorce/s/c/the_hidden_costs_of_divorce%3A_don%27t_overlook_these_expenses/ |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal fees can add up into the tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name="divorcehq.com"/&gt;  Divorced spouses may not qualify for benefits such as health insurance, which must then be paid out-of-pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=divorcehq.com, "Divorce and COBRA" |url=http://www.divorcehq.com/articles/divorce_cobra.shtml|publisher= divorcehq.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on jurisdiction, adultery may negatively affect the outcome of the divorce for the "guilty" spouse, even if adultery is not a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impowr.org/content/current-legal-framework-adultery-chile|title=Current Legal Framework: Adultery in Chile|work=impowr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexually transmitted infections===
{{Further|Sexually transmitted disease}}
Like any sexual contact, extramarital sex opens the possibility of the introduction of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) into a marriage. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=family.jrank.org, "Birth Control{{snd}}Contraceptive Methods, Sociocultural and Historical Aspects" |url=http://family.jrank.org/pages/163/Birth-Control.html|publisher= jrank.com |accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; STDs can be introduced to a marriage partner by a spouse engaging in unprotected extramarital sex. This can be a [[public health]] issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriers{{snd}}to openly talk about this situation would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate safer sex (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited.&lt;ref&gt;http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-12032012-153412/unrestricted/dissertation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aids2031.org/pdfs/safe%20and%20consensual%20sex%20are%20women%20empowered%20enough%20to%20negotiate.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227101002/http://www.aids2031.org/pdfs/safe%20and%20consensual%20sex%20are%20women%20empowered%20enough%20to%20negotiate.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gender power imbalance on women's capacity to negotiate self-protection against HIV/AIDS in Botswana and South Africa | pmc=1831928 | pmid=16245988 | doi=10.5555/afhs.2005.5.3.188 | volume=5 | issue=3 | year=2005 | journal=Afr Health Sci | pages=188–97 | last1 = Langen | first1 = TT| doi-broken-date=2018-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of [[HIV/AIDS]], because they found it very difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to ask medical advice if they thought they have been infected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/InfoBulletinIntimatePartnerViolenceFinal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==
[[File:Adulteri.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Inca]] woman and man to be stoned for adultery, by [[Huamán Poma]] ]]
Historically, female adultery often resulted in extreme violence, including [[murder]] (of the woman, her lover, or both, committed by her husband). Today, domestic violence is outlawed in most countries.

===Honor killings===
{{Main|Honor killing}}
[[Honor killings]] are often connected to accusations of adultery. Honor killings [[Honor killing#By region|continue to be practiced in some parts of the world]], particularly (but not only) in parts of South Asia and the Middle East. Honor killings are treated leniently in some legal systems.&lt;ref&gt;According to the report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (2002) concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83): The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Guatemala]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Peru]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].[http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/985168F508EE799FC1256C52002AE5A9/$File/N0246790.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Honor killings have also taken place in immigrant communities in Europe, Canada and the U.S. In some parts of the world, honor killings enjoy considerable public support: in one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in Jordan's capital city, Amman, approved of honor killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-22992365|title=Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings'|newspaper=BBC News|date=2013-06-20|last1=Maher|first1=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in [[Diyarbakir]], Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4357158.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - 'Honour' crime defiance in Turkey|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2005-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2009, in [[Syria]], it was legal for a husband to kill or injure his wife or his female relatives caught in [[flagrante delicto]] committing adultery or other illegitimate sexual acts. The law has changed to allow the perpetrator to only "benefit from the attenuating circumstances, provided that he serves a prison term of no less than two years in the case of killing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=28169&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=1263 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130416012813/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=28169&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=1263 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-16 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2013-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other articles also provide for reduced sentences. Article 192 states that a judge may opt for reduced punishments (such as short-term imprisonment) if the killing was done with an honorable intent. Article 242 says that a judge may reduce a sentence for murders that were done in rage and caused by an illegal act committed by the victim.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria: No Exceptions for Honor Killings|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/28/syria-no-exceptions-honor-killings|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2011-12-08|date=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Jordan has amended its Criminal Code to modify its laws which used to offer a complete defense for honor killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/belief-that-honour-killings-are-justified-still-prevalent-among-jordans-next-generation-study-shows|title=Belief that honour killings are 'justified' still prevalent among Jordan's next generation, study shows|date=20 June 2013|work=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN in 2002:

:"The report of the [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] ... concerning cultural practices in the family that are violent towards women (E/CN.4/2002/83), indicated that honour killings had been reported in [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Turkey]], [[Yemen]], and other Mediterranean and Persian Gulf countries, and that they had also taken place in western countries such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, within migrant communities."&lt;ref name="unhchr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour |url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/985168F508EE799FC1256C52002AE5A9/$File/N0246790.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu-Ghanem women speak out against serial 'honor killings'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829440.html|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=2007-02-23| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070225090106/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829440.html| archivedate= 25 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimes of passion===
{{Main|Crime of passion}}
[[Crimes of passion]] are often triggered by jealousy, and, according to [[Human Rights Watch]], "have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|work=nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoning===
{{Main|Stoning}}
[[Stoning]], or lapidation, refers to a form of [[capital punishment]] whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies, or the condemned person is pushed from a platform set high enough above a stone floor that the fall would probably result in instantaneous death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html|title = Examining Halcha, Jewish issues and secular law|last = Rapps|first = Dennis|author2 = Weinberg, Lewin|date = December 1999|work = Jewish Law:Legal briefs|publisher = Ira Kasdan|accessdate=2009-10-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091105092848/http://www.jlaw.com/Briefs/capital2.html| archivedate= 5 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning continues to be practiced today, in parts of the world. Recently, several people have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali, and Pakistan by tribal courts.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include:

===Flogging===
{{Main|Flogging|Judicial corporal punishment}}
In some jurisdictions [[flogging]] is a punishment for adultery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-10890137|title=Five flogged in Indonesia despite human rights protests|newspaper=BBC News|date=2010-08-06|last1=Vaswani|first1=Karishma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/01/world/asia/brunei-sharia-law/|title=Brunei adopts sharia law amid international outcry|author=Arshiya Khullar |date=1 May 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also incidents of extrajudicial floggings, ordered by informal religious courts. In 2011, a 14-year-old girl in Bangladesh died after being publicly lashed, when she was accused of having an affair with a married man.

===Violence between the partners of an adulterous couple===
Married people who form relations with extramarital partners or people who engage in relations with partners married to somebody else may be subjected to violence in these relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/10/31/wills_found_guilty_of_murdering_mistress.html|title=Wills found guilty of murdering mistress|date=31 October 2007|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-officer-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-killing-his-mistress-and-daughter/2013/03/22/315eea9c-92fe-11e2-a31e-14700e2724e4_story.html|title=D.C. officer sentenced to life in prison for killing his mistress and daughter|author=Spencer S.

There are bilateral '''treaties that govern aviation rights''' between the United States and China, which cover both passenger services and cargo services. The United States has liberal aviation agreements with many countries but not China, Japan, South Africa, and some [[South American]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/23/AR2007052301120.html |title=U.S., China Agree to Double Flights |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= May 24, 2007|accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no "[[open skies]]" agreement between China and the US, which generally refers to an agreement that allows unrestricted flights between countries. The current US-China treaty specifies the number of flights permitted. Due to the highly regulated nature of awards for route authority between the two countries and the strict limits on number of flights, the application process is competitive. US airlines have sought to gain support from local politicians and the general public to influence the US government into awarding routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19810893/ |title=Five U.S. airlines seek new routes to China |publisher=MSNBC |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current passenger flights operating==
In 2006, there were 10 non-stop flights between the two countries 2 million passenger trips per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Richma |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/323022_chinatrade10.html |title=U.S., China sign accord at Sea-Tac that could double flights between the two |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=July 9, 2007 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, there were 28 non-stop routes (not including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), operated by three major US carriers, United, American and Delta, and four Chinese carriers, Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Hainan Airlines. 

As of 2018, there are 61 non-stop routes (not including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), operated by four US carriers, United, American, Delta and six Chinese carriers, Air China, China Eastern, China Southern, Hainan, Xiamen and Sichuan Airlines.

The airlines flying between China and the United States cooperate in airline alliance and through codesharing. Participating in airline alliances and codesharing is intended to increase passenger traffic on the airline by allowing reciprocal frequent flyer program benefits and increasing the number of flights that an airline offers, even though the flights are operated by another airline. The first marketing alliance between airlines of the two countries was established in 1996 between Northwest Airlines and Air China.&lt;ref name=NWAUpClose&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwa.com/corpinfo/upclose/1990.shtml |title=Northwest Historical Timeline (1990) |publisher=Nwa.com |date=July 20, 2013 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
[[File:Boeing 707-331B, Trans World Airlines (TWA) JP5958637.jpg|thumb|A [[Trans World Airlines]] [[Boeing 707]] flying a charter flight at [[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]] in 1980.]]
[[File:Boeing 747SP-21, United Airlines AN1403287.jpg|thumb|A [[United Airlines]] [[747SP]] taxis at [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] in 1988.]]
In 1979, diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States were established. Previously, there had been no air service between China and the United States after 1949 although there were flights between the United States and sections of China controlled by the government based in [[Taipei]] (Taiwan).

In January 1981, [[Civil Aviation Administration of China|CAAC]] and [[Pan Am]] began flying between China and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/29/business/pan-am-service-to-china.html |title=Pan Am Service to China |location=New York City; Peking (China) |publisher=New York Times |date=January 29, 1981 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northwest Airlines resumed flying to China in 1984. Facing financial troubles, Pan Am sold its Pacific route authority, as well as aircraft and equipment, to United Airlines in 1985 leading to United Airlines operating former Pan Am routes over the Pacific in February 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kelly Cusack |url=http://www.everythingpanam.com/ |title=everythingPanAm |publisher=everythingPanAm |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hong Kong, which was previously a British Crown Colony until 1981 and a British dependent territory from 1981 to 1997, is now a part of China but has a separate air agreement with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2005_April_28/ai_n13660588 |title=Hong Kong will consider expanding US air travel agreement |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macau, formerly governed by Portugal but now governed by China, also has a separate air agreement with the United States. The province of Taiwan is considered to be a part of China by both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, but the island is under de facto control by the government based in Taipei, not Beijing. Due to the severing of diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) by the United States in 1978 in order to establish relations with the People's Republic of China and because the mainland government does not control the province of Taiwan, there is no air service agreement between the United States concerning the province. However, there is an air service agreement between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2006/10/13/06-8665/agreements-in-force-as-of-december-31-2005-between-the-american-institute-in-taiwan-and-the-taipei |title=Agreements In Force as of December 31, 2005 Between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States |publisher=Federal Register |date= |accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the small number of flights, air fares tend to be high between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/tibetan-english/news/a-28-a-2004-07-24-2-1-90264472.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20110522092732/http://www.voanews.com/tibetan-english/news/a-28-a-2004-07-24-2-1-90264472.html|deadurl=yes|title=US, China Sign Agreement to Increase Commercial Flights - 2004-07-24 …|date=May 22, 2011|archivedate=May 22, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the stated goal of both countries is for an open skies agreement, the process of reaching such an agreement has taken several years and has not been completed. Liu Weimin, director of the Aviation Laws Research Centre with the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China, has said "Under the current market situation, local carriers have a hard time competing against global giants such as Continental. That is why US airlines are enthusiastic to fly to China, while Chinese carriers are hesitating to open more flights. For local airlines, more flights may mean more losses if they cannot get enough passengers."&lt;ref name=Conti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/30/eng20060930_307810.html |title=(Continental) Airline hopes for Shanghai flight |publisher=English.peopledaily.com.cn |date=September 30, 2006 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been reports that the load factors (percentage of seats sold) in business and first class are lower on Chinese carriers than on US carriers.&lt;ref&gt;"Whitaker said United's China flights were some of the more profitable ones because they were generally full, including the lucrative business and first-class sections.
In contrast, Chinese carriers offering international service cater predominantly to Chinese passengers. Those airlines often have plenty of vacancies in business and first class, making some of those routes unprofitable." [http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-chinaair7aug07 U.S. airlines vie for new non-stop LAX-China routes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the route authority of the Chinese airlines is used.

===First non-stop service===
The first scheduled non-stop flight between the two countries took place on May 1, 1996, between Detroit and Beijing, and was operated by Northwest Airlines three times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Airport History|url=http://www.metroairport.com/TravelerInfo/GeneralInfo/AboutDTW/AirportHistory.aspx|website=metroairport.com|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northwest Airlines began Detroit-Shanghai non-stop flights twice a week starting April 6, 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200101/15/eng20010115_60543.html |title=Northwest Airlines to Improve China-US Passenger, Cargo Service |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; before discontinuing non-stop service 18 months later and discontinuing non-stop Detroit-Beijing service in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2007/07/23/daily62.html |title=Delta makes case against competitors for China routes |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=July 26, 2007 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the route was later re-instated on July 1, 2011 under the [[Delta Air Lines]] brand) Northwest Airlines then became the only airline authorized to fly China that did not offer any non-stop service to that country until it resumed non-stop flights between Detroit and Shanghai on June 1, 2009 (as part of its new parent, [[Delta Air Lines]]).

In April 2000, United Airlines discontinued Shanghai–Tokyo service and launched its first US–China non-stop service from San Francisco to Shanghai. In June 2000, United Airlines discontinued Beijing–Tokyo service and started non-stop Beijing–San Francisco service. This replacement of services was done because of the restrictions on the number of flights permitted under the 1999 air services agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200404/13/eng20040413_140225.shtml |title=United Airlines pins high hopes on China |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=June 25, 2004 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, all China routes serviced by United Airlines are non-stop. United's Beijing–Tokyo service was re-instated on October 26 as a temporary replacement for the Dulles–Beijing non-stop service (which was suspended for the winter season). United's Dulles–Beijing service operates year-round.

China Eastern began service to San Francisco in 1997 but has since discontinued passenger service to the airport, though cargo flights continue to be operated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irasia.com/listco/hk/chinaeast/annual/97/chairst.htm |title=China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited Chairman's Statement |publisher=Irasia.com |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China Eastern later resumed service to San Francisco on April 26, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2013-01/10/content_16102669.htm |title=China Eastern flights to link San Francisco and Shanghai |publisher=chinadaily.com.cn |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passenger service to Chicago via Seattle has also been discontinued. Several Chinese airlines operated services to Anchorage, primarily as a fuel stop but such stops are no longer operated, in part because of long range aircraft in service.

In 2007, Delta Air Lines won the bid to operate non-stop flights between Atlanta and Shanghai. However, in 2009, only one year after having won the route, Delta suspended the route due to weak customer demand, the struggling US economy, high fuel prices, and the [[H1N1 flu]] pandemic. Delta flew its final Atlanta-Shanghai route on September 1, 2009. Delta replaced Northwest on its Detroit–Shanghai service using its Boeing 777 on October 24, 2009. Delta re-instated the Atlanta to Shanghai route on June 5, 2011, operating 2 days a week, as part of the carrier's international expansion for 2011. The route, however, ceased on January 17, 2012 for the second time citing poor performance on the route.

[[File:Pudongairport2.JPG|thumb|[[Northwest Airlines]] aircraft at [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport]] in 2006]]
===1999 Air Services Agreement===
Concluded in April 1999, airlines from each country were allowed to increase the number of weekly flights from 27 to 54, including cargo flights.&lt;ref name=FlightRecorders&gt;[http://www.dot.gov/affairs/dot09004.htm NHTSA Proposes Requirements For Voluntarily Installed Event Data Recorders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217092105/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/dot09004.htm |date=February 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 20 of these flights were designated for all-cargo flights. Each country was allowed to designate one additional airline so that four airlines from each country were allowed to fly between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transportation.northwestern.edu/sources/China-US_Air_Cargo_Jul07_Tanger_vD.pdf The Air Cargo Market between China and the United States: Demand, Developments and Competition (2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719065654/http://transportation.northwestern.edu/sources/China-US_Air_Cargo_Jul07_Tanger_vD.pdf |date=July 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Airlines gained additional frequencies under this agreement and, in April 2000, started non-stop Shanghai-San Francisco service.&lt;ref name="United-Airlines-Inc-Mar-2000-10-K405"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1609/0000101001-00-000002.pdf |title=United Airlines Inc, Form 10-K405, Filing Date Mar 15, 2000 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 agreement===
A new agreement was signed July 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-555172/United-States-China-sign-agreement.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929133018/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-555172/United-States-China-sign-agreement.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement allowed each country's carriers to serve any city in the other country. In practice, service between the two countries occurs between three large Chinese cities and a few cities in the U.S. Prior to the agreement, Chinese carriers were limited to 12 U.S. cities, and U.S. passenger carriers to only five Chinese cities. The agreement permitted unlimited code-sharing between U.S. and Chinese airlines, which had previously been limited to certain cities.&lt;ref name=FlightRecorders /&gt;

At the time of the agreement, there were plans for additional negotiations to begin in 2006 which led to another agreement in 2007.&lt;ref name=FlightRecorders /&gt;

The 2004 agreement led to the 2005 expansion of flights between the two countries as well as new service by Northwest Airlines from Tokyo to Guangzhou, which began on November 1, 2004, operated using Boeing 757 aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwa.com/corpinfo/upclose/2000.shtml |title=Northwest Historical Timeline (2000) |publisher=Nwa.com |date=July 20, 2013 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The route was planned to be resumed on July 6, 2011, by Delta, however, the airline indefinitely postponed the route.) United Airlines began non-stop Chicago–Shanghai flights on October 31, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/stories/2004/10/25/daily70.html |title=United Airlines to fly Chicago-Shanghai |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=October 30, 2004 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 expansion===
In June 2005, the U.S. [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] awarded [[American Airlines]] authority to fly between Chicago and Shanghai as well as authority to [[Continental Airlines]] to fly between Newark and Beijing.&lt;ref name=RAtoUnited&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/transportation-communications/transportation-services/4140070-1.html DOT Awards China Route Authority To United] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204504/http://www.allbusiness.com/transportation-communications/transportation-services/4140070-1.html |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 expansion===
In 2006, several U.S. airlines applied for additional route authority that was granted in 2007. The [[United Airlines]] application to fly between [[Dulles International Airport]] near Washington, D.C., and Beijing was selected. The route started operating on March 25, 2007, using [[Boeing 747-400]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quotation=The (U.S.) Department of Transportation cited that United's Washington-Beijing proposal would fill the critical service gap between the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and China, provide the greatest increase in capacity, and noted that the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area is the largest city in the proceeding lacking any non-stop service to China |url=http://www.dot.gov/affairs/dot1707.htm |title=DOT Awards New Daily US–China Flight to United Airlines |website=Dot.gov |accessdate=2016-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628114714/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/dot1707.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[United Airlines|United]]'s application, [[American Airlines]], [[Continental Airlines]] and [[Northwest Airlines]] had also applied for route authority.

Continental applied for rights to fly between [[Newark, New Jersey]], and Shanghai. Northwest applied for the right to fly to Shanghai from Detroit. American's application originally was for non-stop service between [[Dallas/Fort Worth]] and Beijing, but changed the application to include an eastbound stop in Chicago after an impasse with pilots regarding work hours on the planned flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mutzabaugh |first=Ben |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-01-09-china-route-awarded_x.htm |title=United wins new route to China |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, the two countries began negotiations for further liberalization of the bilateral agreement. Talks were suspended in August 2006, but later resumed. The United States has stated that suspension of talks was due to an unrelated issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/January/20070129151507saikceinawz0.9439051.html |title=Opening Market with China Tops U.S. Civil Aviation Priorities |publisher=America.gov |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021115803/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/January/20070129151507saikceinawz0.9439051.html |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficial Chinese sources report that there was concern because of a "gap" in Chinese airlines' ability to compete with U.S. airlines.&lt;ref name=Conti /&gt; Negotiations were scheduled to resume in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyconsulate.prchina.org/eng/xw/t283706.htm |title=China-U.S. first strategic economic dialogue ends |publisher=Nyconsulate.prchina.org |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108044045/http://www.nyconsulate.prchina.org/eng/xw/t283706.htm |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement reached on July 7, 2007, allows nearly unlimited service between China and [[Guam]] and between China and the Northern Mariana Islands. These unlimited rights do not include Beijing or Shanghai flights operated by US airlines but do include those cities for mainland Chinese airlines.&lt;ref name=USCAgree /&gt;

Not including the potential expansion to Guam and Saipan (Northern Mariana Islands), by 2011 the current bilateral between the two countries will expand the number of US airlines flying to China from four to nine airlines and from 54 passenger flights weekly to 249.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/eap/Archive/2005/Mar/14-492650.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217140439/https://usinfo.state.gov/eap/Archive/2005/Mar/14-492650.html |archivedate=December 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations for an open skies agreement were scheduled to begin not later than March 25, 2010, according to a treaty between the two countries.&lt;ref name=USCAgree&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/88275.pdf |title=U.S.-China Air Transport Agreement of July 9, 2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.gov/affairs/052307china.htm U.S. – CHINA AIR SERVICES AGREEMENT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615020155/http://www.dot.gov/affairs/052307china.htm |date=June 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2007, 2008, and 2009 awards, the Department of Transportation awarded routes at one time instead of considering one year at a time. United and Delta objected unsuccessfully to have the process separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dmses.dot.gov/docimages/pdf101/476459_web.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 expansion===
One award to a new entrant, an airline not flying to China, was decided. Delta applied for [[Atlanta]]–Shanghai using 777-200ER initially then 777-200LR when they are delivered in 2008. [[Northwest Airlines|Northwest]] applied for route authority as a new entrant, claiming that although it flies to China, it does so via Japan and not non-stop. It envisioned using a 747-400 if awarded the route in 2007 but planned to use a 787 if awarded the route in 2009.

Several sources have noted that before the route authority was granted, Delta was virtually assured of being awarded the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aviationdaily&amp;id=news/DLPVG06257.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013342/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_generic.jsp?channel=aviationdaily&amp;id=news%2FDLPVG06257.xml|archivedate=September 27, 2007|title=Aviation Week : Delta A Shoo-In For China, But Start Date Unclear|date=September 27, 2007|publisher=|access-date=May 25, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/business--lobby/airlines-battle-to-provide-lucrative-flights-to-china-2007-07-31.html |title=Airlines battle to provide lucrative flights to China |publisher=Thehill.com |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705174454/http://thehill.com/business--lobby/airlines-battle-to-provide-lucrative-flights-to-china-2007-07-31.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams |first=Marilyn |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-07-02-delta-china_N.htm |title=Delta in line for non-stop route to China |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=July 2, 2007 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DOT awarded the route to Delta on September 25, 2007. Delta announced that it will begin service on March 30, 2008, one of the latest dates that they were allowed to begin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/primenewswire/127339.htm ]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route was later suspended in September 2009. However, Delta re-instated the route starting June 5, 2011.

===2008 expansion===
One award for flights between [[Guangzhou]] and the United States was granted. Only United Airlines applied and was granted rights. It planned San Francisco–Guangzhou service using a Boeing 777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mutzabaugh |first=Ben |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-09-25-china-flights_N.htm |title=Six non-stop U.S.-China routes OK'd |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, United delayed the route to June 30, 2010, due to the sudden decrease in international travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id%3D33454%26seenIt%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512010331/http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/news.pl?id=33454 |archivedate=May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 expansion===
One award was granted to a new entrant airline as stated by the DOT when applications were sought. [[Hawaiian Airlines]] has withdrawn its application. [[US Airways]] applied for [[Philadelphia]]–Beijing authority using an [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-300]], an aircraft that it neither operates nor has any firm orders to buy. [[Maxjet]] applied for rights between Seattle and Shanghai using an all business class configured Boeing 767-200ER. US Airways was granted rights by the DOT over Maxjet citing more seat availability and greater connecting possibilities with the US Airways bid.&lt;ref name=2007DOT&gt;[http://dmses.dot.gov/docimages/pdf103/487893_web.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the airline relinquished the DOT authorization for Beijing at the end of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Airways considers non-stop Asia flights from Philadelphia International|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-05-17/business/31727715_1_nonstop-flights-philadelphia-international-airport-asia|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hainan Airlines]] began service from Beijing to Seattle with A330 equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.hnair.com |title=Flying With Hainan Airlines |publisher=Global.hnair.com |date= |accessdate=August 20, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314050317/http://global.hnair.com/ |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three routes to U.S. carriers that were not new entrants were awarded. There were applications for six routes. 
*Northwest applied for Detroit–Beijing using a [[Boeing 787]] to be granted if it is not award the route using a [[Boeing 747-400]] in 2007. It also applied for a 787 operated Detroit–Shanghai route.
*United Airlines applied for Los Angeles–Shanghai using 747-400 aircraft. [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]–Shanghai is an alternate routing of above application.
*American Airlines applied for Chicago–Beijing (to have begun April 26, 2010; which actually launched May 25, 2010 after numerous delays). 
*Continental applied for [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]–Shanghai using a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] Continental had previously applied for the same route some years earlier in which United was awarded the Washington–Beijing route. Delta applied for Atlanta–Beijing using a [[Boeing 777]].

The American Airlines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines route applications were granted.&lt;ref name=2007DOT /&gt; The DOT cited the United application as "not addressing the broader competitive needs" given that United has approximately half of the flights by U.S. carriers to China. The DOT cited American's OneWorld airline alliance as having less access to the US–China market as one of the factors in its decision.

In a hint of the DOT's decision-making process and preferences, it stated in its report intention to grant Continental and American Airlines route authority that "this tentatively leaves seven frequencies to be awarded ... Delta and Northwest." The DOT stated that Northwest, which already had route authority between Detroit and China but has chosen to fly the route via Tokyo (though it did operate some non-stop flights in the past), was applying for additional Detroit–China authority. Such application was denied in the past due to the limited number of new route authority but that now there is more leeway with more flights permitted by treaty. The DOT selected Detroit–Shanghai over Detroit–Beijing. The DOT noted that Delta was not awarded its route application because it would not have much experience in the Chinese market when the 2009 award was to start, given that it would only begin Atlanta–Shanghai service on March 30, 2008.&lt;ref name=2007DOT /&gt; The Atlanta–Shanghai Delta service was suspended on September 1, 2009, but was re-instated on June 5, 2011; the route, however, ceased again on January 17, 2012 due to poor loads. Delta also applied to the US DOT to begin non-stop flights between Detroit and Beijing starting July 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20101117/FREE/101119854/delta-plans-nonstop-flights-from-metro-airport-to-beijing# |title=Crain's Detroit Business : Subscription Center |website=Crainsdetroit.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New restrictions on sale of route authority by U.S. carriers===
The DOT also announced, along with its 2007–2009 route authority awards, that route authority must be operated for five years before it could be sold. Previously, the required period was one year.&lt;ref name=2007DOT /&gt;

The '''Alaska boundary dispute''' was a [[territorial dispute]] between the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], which then controlled [[Canada]]'s foreign relations. It was resolved by [[arbitration]] in 1903. The dispute existed between the [[Russian Empire]] and Britain since 1821, and was inherited by the United States as a consequence of the [[Alaska Purchase]] in 1867.&lt;ref name="D.M.L.FARR"&gt;{{cite web |date=February 6, 2006 |url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alaska-boundary-dispute/ |title = Alaska Boundary Dispute |work= The Canadian Encyclopedia | first=D. M. L. |last=Farr |quote= |accessdate=October 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The final resolution favored the American position, and Canada did not get an all-Canadian outlet from the [[Yukon]] gold fields to the sea. The disappointment and anger in Canada was directed less at the United States, and more at the British government for betraying Canadian interests in favour of healthier [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibson (1943)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===1825–1898===

In 1825 Russia and Britain signed a treaty to define the borders of their respective colonial possessions, the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)|Anglo-Russian Convention of 1825]]. Part of the wording of the treaty was that:

{{quote|the said line shall ascend to the north along the channel called [[Portland Channel]] as far as the point of the continent where it strikes the [[56th parallel north|56th degree of north]] latitude; from this last-mentioned point, the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains situated parallel to the coast as far as the point of intersection of the [[141st meridian west|141st degree of west]] longitude&lt;ref name="Political Geography p. 82"&gt;''Political Geography'', by Norman J. G. Pounds ({{ISBN|0-07-050566-7}}), 1972 p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The vague phrase "the mountains parallel to the coast" was further qualified thus:

{{quote|Whenever the summit of the mountains ... shall prove to be at the distance of more than ten marine [[League (unit)|leagues]] from the ocean, the limit ... shall be formed by a line parallel to the winding of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.&lt;ref name="Political Geography p. 82"/&gt;}}

This part of the treaty language was an agreement on general principles for establishing a boundary in the area in the future, rather than any exact demarcated line.

Signed in 1839, the [[RAC–HBC Agreement]] created an understanding between the [[Russian-American Company]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Typically referred to as the ''lisière'' (edge), a stretch of the [[Alaskan Panhandle]] from [[Cross Sound]] to [[Parallel 54°40′ north|54°&amp;thinsp;40′]] was given to the HBC as a [[fur trade]] [[monopoly]] in exchange for the agricultural and pastoral products produced by its subsidiary, the [[Puget Sound Agricultural Company]], along with an annual amount of furs given to the Russian company. The lease was renewed until the end of [[Russian America]]. This lease was later brought up by the Province of British Columbia as bearing upon its own territorial interests in the region, but was ignored by Ottawa and London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorenorth.com/library/history/shelest.html ''"The Dryad Affair: Corporate Warfare and Anglo-Russian Rivalry for the Alaskan Lisière"'', J. W. Shelest, ExploreNorth.com website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States bought Alaska in 1867 from Russia in the [[Alaska Purchase]], but the boundary terms were ambiguous. In 1871, [[British Columbia]] united with the new [[Canadian Confederation]]. The Canadian government requested a survey of the boundary, but the United States rejected it as too costly; the border area was very remote and sparsely settled, and without economic or strategic interest. In 1898, the national governments agreed on a compromise, but the government of British Columbia rejected it. U.S. [[William McKinley|President McKinley]] proposed a permanent lease to Canada of a port near [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]], but Canada rejected that compromise.

===Klondike gold rush===
In 1897–98 the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] in [[Yukon]], Canada, enormously increased the population of the general area, which reached 30,000, composed largely of Americans. Some 100,000 fortune seekers moved through Alaska to the [[Klondike River|Klondike gold region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2009 |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/4213/Alaska-Boundary-Dispute.html|title=Alaska Boundary Dispute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of gold and a large new population greatly increased the importance of the region and the desirability of fixing an exact boundary. Canada wanted an all-Canadian route from the gold fields to a seaport. There are claims that Canadian citizens were harassed by the U.S. as a deterrent to making any [[land claim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=321458 ''Statement of facts regarding the Alaska boundary question'', p.3487 [[Alexander Begg (1825–1905)|Alexander Begg]], Victoria, British Columbia, publ. R. Wolfenden, 1902] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527183307/http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=321458 |date=2011-05-27 }}, report to [[David McEwen Eberts]], [[Attorney-General of British Columbia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The head of [[Lynn Canal]] was the main gateway to the Yukon, and the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) sent a detachment to secure the location for Canada. This was based on Canada's assertion that that location was more than ten marine leagues from the sea, which was part of the 1825 boundary definition. A massive influx of American stampeders through [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] very quickly forced the Canadian police to retreat. They set up posts on the desolate summits of Chilkoot and White Passes, complete with a mounted Gatling gun at each post. This was still disputed territory, as many Americans believed that the head of Lake Bennett, another {{convert|12|mi|km}} north, should be the location of the border. To back up the police in their sovereignty claim, the Canadian government also sent the Yukon Field Force, a 200-man Army unit, to the territory. The soldiers set up camp at [[Fort Selkirk]] so that they could be fairly quickly dispatched to deal with problems at either the coastal passes or the [[141st meridian west]].

==Arbitration==
The posts set up on the passes by the NWMP were effective in the short term, as the provisional boundary was accepted, if grudgingly. In September 1898, serious negotiations began between the United States and Canada to settle the issue, but those meetings failed.

The treaty of 1825 was drawn up in French, and the 1903 British advocates discussed the exact meaning of words like "''côte''/coast", "''lisière''/strip" and "''crête''/crest". The maps of [[George Vancouver]], which were used as a fixing line by the commission of 1825, showed a continuous line of mountains parallel to the coast — however, the mountain range is neither parallel to the coast nor continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=John W.|title=An Abridged History of Alaska|date=1909|publisher=Author|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1903, the [[:s:Hay–Herbert Treaty|Hay–Herbert Treaty]] between the United States and Britain entrusted the decision to an arbitration by a mixed tribunal of six members: three Americans ([[Elihu Root]], Secretary of War; [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], senator from Massachusetts; and [[George Turner (U.S. politician)|George Turner]], ex-senator from Washington), two Canadians ([[Louis-Amable Jetté|Sir Louis A. Jette]], Lieutenant Governor of Quebec; and [[Allen Bristol Aylesworth|Allen B. Aylesworth]], K.C., from Toronto), and one Briton ([[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Baron Alverstone]]). All sides respected Root, but he was a member of the [[U.S. Cabinet]]. Canadians ridiculed the choice of the obscure ex-Senator Turner and, especially, Lodge, a leading historian and diplomatic specialist whom they saw as unobjective.&lt;ref name="keenlyside1952"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.questia.com/read/9352181/canada-and-the-united-states-some-aspects-of-their |title=Canada and the United States: Some Aspects of Their Historical Relations |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |author1=Keenlyside, Hugh L. L. |author2=Brown, Gerald S. |year=1952 |pages=178–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribunal considered six main points:{{r|keenlyside1952}}
* Where the boundary began.
* What "Portland Channel" meant, and how to draw the boundary line through it. Four islands were in dispute.
* The definition of the line from "the southernmost point of Prince of Wales Island to Portland Channel", which depended on the answer to the previous question.
* The line from Portland Channel to the [[56th parallel north]].
* The width of the ''lisière'' (border or edge), and how to measure it.
* Whether mountain ranges existed in the area.

The British member Lord Alverstone sided with the U.S. position on these basic issues, although the final agreed demarcation line fell significantly short of the maximal U.S. claim (it was a compromise falling roughly between the maximal U.S. and maximal Canadian claim). The "BC Panhandle" (the [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek region]]) was not quite [[exclave]]d from the rest of British Columbia.

In 1929 Canadian scholar [[Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside|Hugh L. L. Keenlyside]] concluded, "The Americans, of course, did have the better case." He judged that most of the tribunal's decisions were fair. Regarding the key issue of the islands in the Portland Channel, however,{{r|keenlyside1952}}

{{quote|there can be little doubt that the tribunal in this instance accepted a compromise, which, however justified by the political considerations involved, was a direct violation of the judicial character of the court. Instead of accepting either the American or the British claim ''in toto'', the line was drawn through Tongas Passage, thus giving each country a portion of its claim, but entirely disregarding the real problem involved. The original negotiators might, logically, have intended the line to be drawn either as the British claimed or as the Americans claimed; certainly they had no intention of dividing the channel islands between the two ... There can be scarcely any doubt that Lord Alverstone's final pronouncement was merely an attempt to rationalize a political expedient ... In all but one case they seem justified by the facts, and yet that one case of political compromise tarnished the whole award.{{r|keenlyside1952}}}}

This was one of several concessions that Britain offered to the United States (the others being on fisheries and the Panama Canal). It was part of a general policy of ending the chill in Britain–U.S. relations, achieving rapprochement, winning American favour and resolving outstanding issues ([[the Great Rapprochement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kennedy, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers]]'' (1987) p 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

===Growth of a distinct Canadian identity===
Keenlyside and Brown wrote that{{r|keenlyside1952}}

{{quote|Had the United States been willing to submit her case to [[Permanent Council of Arbitration|The Hague]], or to an impartial juridical body, as Canada had desired, the result would have been, in all probability, substantially the same, except that Canadians could not feel that they had been unfairly treated. ... Had justices of the [[United States Supreme Court]] been appointed in the place of the two Senators, Canadian criticism of the award would not have been audible.{{r|keenlyside1952}}}}

The Canadian judges refused to sign the award, issued on 20 October 1903, due to the Canadian delegates' disagreement with Lord Alverstone's vote. Canadians protested the outcome, not so much the decision itself but that the Americans had chosen politicians instead of jurists for the tribunal, and that the British had helped their own interests by betraying Canada's.{{r|keenlyside1952}} This led to intense anti-British emotions erupting throughout Canada (including [[Quebec]]) as well as a surge in [[Canadian nationalism]] as separate from an imperial identity.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Munro, "English-Canadianism and the Demand for Canadian Autonomy: Ontario's Response to the Alaska Boundary Decision, 1903." ''Ontario History'' 1965 57(4): 189–203.&lt;/ref&gt; Although suspicions of the U.S. provoked by the award may have contributed to Canada's rejection of a [[Canadian nationalism#Free trade with the U.S.|free trade with the United States]] in the 1911 "[[Canadian federal election, 1911|reciprocity election]]",{{r|keenlyside1952}} historian F. W. Gibson concluded that Canadians vented their anger less upon the United States and "to a greater degree upon Great Britain for having offered such feeble resistance to American aggressiveness. The circumstances surrounding the settlement of the dispute produced serious dissatisfaction with Canada's position in the British Empire."&lt;ref&gt;Gibson (1943) at notes 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Infuriated, like most Canadians, Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] explained to Parliament, "So long as Canada remains a dependency of the British Crown the present powers that we have are not sufficient for the maintenance of our rights."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schull, ''Laurier'' (1965) pp 431–32&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian anger gradually subsided, but the feeling that Canada should control its own foreign policy may have contributed to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]].{{r|keenlyside1952}}

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}
'''Albian Sands Energy Inc'''. is the operator of the '''Muskeg River Mine''' and '''Jack Pine Mine''', an [[oil sands]] mining project located {{convert|75|km|mi}} north of [[Fort McMurray]], [[Alberta]], Canada. It is a joint venture between [[Shell Canada]] (10%), [[CNRL]] (70%) and [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Canada]] (20%).  The company's legal headquarters are located in the [[Shell Tower (Calgary)|Shell Tower]] in [[Calgary]], Alberta. Albian Sands got its name from the Albian Boreal Sea which, during the [[Albian]] stage of the [[Cretaceous]] (over 100&amp;nbsp;million years ago), moved over the McMurray sands and deposited a blanket of marine shale on its floor which trapped the hydrocarbons of the McMurray Formation. The oil sands resources of the Muskeg River Mine are a legacy of the Albian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;

At full production, Albian Sands can produce {{convert|340000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} of crude [[bitumen]], a naturally occurring semi-solid form of crude oil. The mine product, diluted bitumen or ''[[dilbit]]'', is sent to be upgraded at the [[Scotford Upgrader]] in [[Fort Saskatchewan]]. The Muskeg River Mine stands on a Shell Canada lease containing more than {{convert|5|Goilbbl|m3}} of mineable bitumen, of which it is expected to recover {{convert|1650|Moilbbl|m3}} of bitumen over the next 30 years. The Muskeg River Mine, Jack Pine Mine and the Scotford Upgrader together comprise the '''Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP)'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Background==

===Facts===
Ms Albrighton ({{Nee|Zengin}}) was born with [[kyphoscoliosis]] and [[spina bifida]] which seriously impaired her respiratory function and shortened her life expectancy. In July 1971 she was admitted to [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] for corrective surgery intended to straighten and lengthen her spine in a procedure known as halo-pelvic [[traction (orthopedics)|traction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Journal of Biomechanics |volume=4 |issue=6 |date=December 1971 |pages=589-590 |title=Halo pelvic traction appliance for spinal deformities |author1=Clark J.A. |author2=Kesterton, L. |doi=10.1016/0021-9290(71)90048-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the hospital she was treated by Dr Harry Tyer, an [[orthopaedic surgeon]]. The hospitals consultation sheet recorded on 23 July 1971 that "Dr Tyer would appreciate advice regarding significance of her hairy [[naevus]] with respect to spinal pathology and possible dangers to cord of correction of scoliosis by halo-pelvic traction."&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"/&gt;{{rp|169}} The frame was attached to her skull and pelvis on 26 July 1971. On that day Professor Richard Gye, a [[Neurosurgery|neuro-surgeon]], wrote on the consultation sheet "As she has had (just) traction I will see her later in the week."&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"/&gt;{{rp|169}} A [[myelogram]] was not carried out prior to applying traction, which commenced on 28 July. On 30 July Ms Albrighton  started showing signs of spinal cord involvement. By 1 August Ms Albrighton became unable to walk. All traction was stopped on 2 August, however her spinal cord was totally severed leaving her a paraplegic. Professor Gye saw Ms Albrighton on 2 August however the paraplegia was irrevocable.

===Prior actions===

In 1977 Ms Albrighton commenced proceedings in the [[Supreme Court of NSW]], claiming that either or both of the doctors were negligent and the hospital was [[vicarious liability|vicariously liable]] for their negligence. The case was heard before [[David Yeldham|Yeldham J]] and a [[Jury trial|jury]].&lt;ref&gt;At the time proceedings for damages caused by negligence were commonly tried under the system before a judge who determined questions of law and a jury which determined questions of fact: see ''Pambula District Hospital v Herriman'' (1988) 14 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 387 and {{cite AustLII|NSWCA|39|2007|litigants=Maroubra Rugby League Club Inc v Malo |parallelcite=(2007) 69 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 496}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yeldham J had allowed only part of the hospital medical records to be tendered. Neither Dr Tyer nor Professor Gye gave evidence. After 11 days of hearing Yeldham J directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendants.&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"&gt;''Albrighton v Royal Prince Alfred Hospital'' [1979] 2 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 165 (14 August 1979) [[Supreme Court of NSW]].&lt;/ref&gt; Yeldham J held that :
# A hospital in NSW is only vicariously liable for the negligence of a doctor if it can direct the doctor as to the manner in which he can do his work. It is not enough if the hospital can direct the doctor as to what work he can do.&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"/&gt;{{rp|168}}
# Having regard to the decision in [[Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee]]''  [1957] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 118; [1957] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 582, [[High Court of England &amp; Wales]].&lt;/ref&gt; negligence required proof of proper medical practice in Sydney in 1971.&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"/&gt;{{rp|175}}
# There was no evidence on which the jury could find the hospital could direct the doctors as to the manner in which they did their work.&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"/&gt;{{rp|168}}
# There was no evidence Professor Gye had seen Ms Albrighton nor given advice to Dr Tyer.&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"/&gt;{{rp|170}}
# There was no evidence Dr Tyer was negligent in:
:# failing to obtain neurological advice from Professor Gye;
:# failing to have myelography carried out before traction was applied;
:# applying traction when there was a likelihood of tethering of the spine..&lt;ref name="Albrighton Trial"/&gt;{{rp|170-1}}

==Judgment==

===Standard of care===
[[Raymond Reynolds|Reynolds JA]] rejected the proposition that doctors could not be negligent if they acted in accordance with the usual and customary practice and procedure in their “medical community”, holding that "it is not the law that, if all or most of the medical practitioners in Sydney habitually fail to take an available precaution to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to their patients, then none can be found guilty of negligence".&lt;ref name="Albrighton NSWCA"/&gt;{{rp|562-3}}

===Claim against the hospital===

Reynolds JA held that the hospital had undertaken to provide for Ms Albrighton's complete medical care and to provide that service through staff chosen by the hospital. On that evidence a jury could find that the hospital had undertaken to take reasonable care to provide for her medical needs and that there was an overriding and continuing duty of care owed by the hospital, regardless of the legal duties imposed on the doctors.&lt;ref name="Albrighton NSWCA"/&gt;{{rp|561-2}}

===Admissibility of hospital records===
[[Frank Hutley|Hutley JA]] held that the evidence of the hospital's Deputy Medical Records Administrator established that the whole of the hospitals records were written for the purposes of the hospital and that those records were "kept for the information of the staff and treating doctors. They are not likely repositories of the speculations of the inexpert; and this is a fact to be considered on their admissibility". Accordingly the documents should have been admitted.&lt;ref name="Albrighton NSWCA"/&gt;{{rp|568}} Similarly Hope JA held that the records were made by people who intended them to be as accurately as possible. While mistakes could occur they were likely to be far more reliable than human memory.&lt;ref name="Albrighton NSWCA"/&gt;{{rp|549}}

===Claim against Dr Tyer===

Reynolds JA held that on the evidence a jury could have found that Dr Tyer had some reservations about applying traction and knew that traction could endagner the integrity of Ms Albrighton's spinal cord. Despite those reservations Dr Tyer had applied traction without receiving any advice or any further diagnostic investigations. On this basis the jury could have found that Dr Tyer had been negligent.&lt;ref name="Albrighton NSWCA"/&gt;{{rp|554-6}}

===Claim against Professor Gye===

Reynolds JA held that on 26 July 1971 Professor Gye ought to have been alerted to the possibility that the spinal cord had not developed properly and knew and accepted that the danger to her spinal cord would depend on his advise. This was enough to impose a duty of care on Professor Gye and the jury may have found that his failure to intervene was a breach of his duty of care.&lt;ref name="Albrighton NSWCA"/&gt;{{rp|556-7}}

===Aftermath===
The Court of Appeal did not decide whether or not the hospital or doctors had been negligent and instead ordered that there be a new trial.&lt;ref name="Albrighton NSWCA"/&gt;{{rp|564-5}} There is however no record of whether such a trial occurred nor its outcome.

==Subsequent consideration==

The approach of the Court of Appeal was subsequently approved by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] in ''[[Rogers v Whitaker]]''&lt;ref name="Rogers v Whitaker"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|58|1992|litigants=[[Rogers v Whitaker]] |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479 |date=19 November 1992 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}} per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey &amp; McHugh JJ at [12] p 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12267">An '''arbitration award''' (or '''arbitral award''') is a determination on the merits by an [[arbitration tribunal]] in an [[arbitration]], and is analogous to a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] in a [[court]] of law. It is referred to as an 'award' even where all of the claimant's claims fail (and thus no money needs to be paid by either party), or the award is of a non-monetary nature.

==Damages and other remedies==

Although arbitration awards are characteristically an award of damages against a party, tribunals usually have a range of remedies that can form a part of the award.
#the tribunal may order the payment of a sum of money (conventional damages)
#the tribunal may make a "[[declaration (law)|declaration]]" as to any matter to be determined in the proceedings
#in most jurisdictions, the tribunal has the same power as a court to:
##order a party to do or refrain from doing something ("[[injunction|injunctive relief]]")
##to order [[specific performance]] of a contract
##to order the [[rectification (law)|rectification]], setting aside or cancellation of a deed or other document.

== Enforcement of Arbitration Awards ==

Arbitration is particularly popular as a means of [[alternative dispute resolution|dispute resolution]] in the commercial sphere (for a summary of the various arenas in which arbitration is usually chosen, see the specific article on "[[arbitration]]"). One of the reasons for doing so is that, in international trade, it is often easier to enforce an arbitration award in a foreign country than it is to enforce a judgment of the court.

Under the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention 1958]], an award issued in a contracting state can generally be freely enforced in any other contracting state, only subject to certain, limited defences. Those defences are:

#a party to the arbitration agreement was, under the law applicable to him, under some incapacity, or the arbitration agreement was not valid under its governing law;
#a party was not given proper notice of the appointment of the arbitrator or of the arbitration proceedings, or was otherwise unable to present its case;
#the award deals with an issue not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or contains matters beyond the scope of the arbitration (subject to the proviso that an award which contains decisions on such matters may be enforced to the extent that it contains decisions on matters submitted to arbitration which can be separated from those matters not so submitted);
#the composition of the arbitral authority was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, failing such agreement, with the law of the place where the hearing took place (the "[[lex loci arbitri]]");
#the award has not yet become binding upon the parties, or has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority, either in the country where the arbitration took place, or pursuant to the law of the arbitration agreement;
#the subject matter of the award was not capable of resolution by arbitration; or
#enforcement would be contrary to "public policy".

Virtually every significant commercial country in the world is a party to the Convention, but relatively few countries have a comprehensive network for cross-border enforcement of judgments of the court.&lt;ref&gt;Although some regions have multi-lateral arrangements which have a similar effect over a smaller area, such as the [[European Union]]'s [[Brussels Regime|Brussels and Lugano Conventions]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries have a multiplicity of reciprocal enforcement of judgments states, and many [[Federation|Federal]] legal systems employ the "[[Full Faith and Credit Clause|full faith and credit]]" doctrine.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence in many countries, particularly in [[emerging markets]], a foreign arbitration award is much easier to enforce than an award of the court. For example, it is very difficult to enforce foreign judgments in the former [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries, but it is considerably easier to enforce awards of an arbitration tribunal.

The other characteristic of cross-border enforcement of arbitration awards that makes them appealing to commercial parties is that they are not limited to awards of damages. Whereas in most countries only monetary judgments are enforceable in the cross-border context, no such restrictions are imposed on arbitration awards and so it is theoretically possible (although unusual in practice) to obtain an [[injunction]] or an order for [[specific performance]] in an arbitration proceeding which could then be enforced in another New York Convention contracting state.

The New York Convention is not actually the only treaty dealing with cross-border enforcement of arbitration awards. The earlier Geneva Convention on the Execution of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1927 [http://interarb.com/vl/g_co1927] remains in force, but the success of the New York Convention means that the Geneva Convention is rarely utilised in practise.

===Arbitration with sovereign governments===
In judicial proceedings in many countries, governments enjoy [[sovereign immunity]] from suit. However, governments can submit to arbitration, and certain international conventions exist in relation to the enforcement of awards against nation states.
* The Washington Convention 1965 relates to settlement of investment disputes between nation states and citizens of other countries. The Convention created the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes]] (or ICSID). The Convention was primarily designed to create investor confidence, and to promote inward investment into developing countries. Compared to other arbitration institutions, relatively few awards have been rendered under ICSID.&lt;ref&gt;Tupman, "Case Studies in the Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes" (1986) 35 ICLQ 813&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Algiers Declaration of 1981 established the Iran-US Claims Tribunal to adjudicate claims of American corporations and individuals in relation to expropriated property during the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979. Although formed in good faith,&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. Government froze billions of dollars' worth of Iranian assets and wanted to set up an impartial tribunal to determine claims to compensation out of those assets by corporations who had been subject to expropriation without compensation in Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; the tribunal has not been a notable success, and has even been held by an English court to be [[void (law)|void]] under its own governing law.&lt;ref&gt;''Dallal v Bank Mellat'' [1986] 1 QB 441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==

Although it is common to talk of an arbitration award as a single concept, in most legal jurisdictions there are several sub-categories of award.
#a '''provisional''' award is an award on a provisional basis subject to the final determination of the merits.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a '''partial''' award is an award of only part of the claims or cross claims which are brought, or a determination of only certain issues between the parties. Importantly, this leaves it open to the parties to either resolve or to continue to arbitrate (or litigate) the remaining issues.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
#an '''agreed''' award is usually in the form of a settlement between the parties of their dispute (the equivalent of a judgment by consent).&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 51.&lt;/ref&gt; But by embodying the settlement in the form of an award it can have a number of advantages.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the losing party may only be entitled to an indemnity where there is an actual award under a policy of insurance.  An award is also easier to enforce than a settlement agreement, and gives rise to an [[estoppel]] against re-litigating settled issues.  Occasionally having an award rather than a settlement agreement may confer tax advantages.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a '''reasoned''' award is not a sub-category of award, but is used to describe an award where the tribunal sets out its reasoning for its decision.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, section 52 of the [[Arbitration Act 1996]] provides that awards must be reasoned unless the parties have agreed that the tribunal may dispense with giving reasons.&lt;/ref&gt;
#an '''additional''' award is an award which the tribunal, by its own initiative or on the application of a party makes in respect of any claim which was presented to the tribunal but was not resolved under the principal award.&lt;ref&gt;In the United Kingdom, see [[Arbitration Act 1996]], section 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
#a '''draft''' award is not an award as such, and is not binding on the parties until confirmed by the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Many tribunals make a practice of permitting the parties to see a draft award to allow basic factual errors or arithmetic mistakes to be flushed out.  The practice helps reduce appeals on trivial technical points.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal requirements==

The legal requirements relating to the making of awards vary from country to country and, in some cases, according to the terms of the arbitration agreement. Although in most countries, awards can be oral, this is relatively uncommon and they are usually delivered in writing.

By way of example, in the United Kingdom, the following are requirements under the Arbitration Act 1996 which the award must comply with, unless the parties agree to vary them under section 52 of the Act:
#the award must be in writing and signed by all of the arbitrators assenting to the award (dissenting minority arbitrators need not sign unless the parties agree that they must);
#the award must contain reasons;
#the award must state the "seat" of the arbitration (the place where the arbitration took place); and
#the award must state the date upon which it is made. This is important for the calculation of interest.

Many countries have similar requirements, but most permit the parties to vary the conditions, which reflects the fact that arbitration is a party-driven process.

==Appeals==

It is sometimes said that arbitration awards are not normally subject to appeal (often another reason given in favour of using arbitration), but that is usually an oversimplification.

Most countries in the world allow arbitration awards to be "challenged" in the court, although they usually limit the circumstances in which such challenges may be brought. The two most commonly permitted grounds of challenge are:
#that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to make the award;&lt;ref&gt;for example, that there was no binding agreement to submit to arbitration&lt;/ref&gt; or
#serious irregularity on the part of the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;"Serious irregularity" covers a multitude of sins, from accepting a [[bribe]] and failing to hear the arguments of one party, to have an improper number of arbitrators or ruling evidence inadmissible when it should not have done so.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitration awards are non-justiciable. Distinguish from an "[[expert determination]]" where the expert determines a matter of fact (which is ordinarily not subject to any form of appeal at all, except in cases of obvious bias or manifest error or bad faith).

In addition, although not by way of challenge, many countries permit appeals on a point of law (although almost no countries permit appeals to be made in relation to findings of fact). This right is usually closely circumscribed to avoid undermining the commercial efficacy of arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, appeal on a point of law can only be made with the leave of the court, and the court will only give leave in very specific and limited circumstances.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Autorité des marchés financiers''' (AMF) is the organisation responsible for [[financial regulation]] in the Canadian province of [[province of Quebec|Québec]]. It regulates the province's financial markets and provides assistance to consumers of financial products and services.  As provided for under its incorporating legislation, the AMF's mission is to enforce the laws governing the regulation of the financial sector, notably in the areas of insurance, securities, deposit institutions (other than banks) and the distribution of financial products and services.

The AMF coordinates its activities with self-regulating bodies such as the ''Chambre des services financiers'' (Chamber of Financial Security) and the ''Chambre de l'Assurance de dommages'' (Chamber of Damage Insurance), including [[professional ethics]] and [[continuing education]].

==History==
Established under An Act respecting the Autorité des marchés financiers on February 1, 2004, the AMF is unique by virtue of its integrated regulation of the Québec financial sector, notably in the areas of insurance, securities, deposit institutions (other than banks) and the distribution of financial products and services.

The "Autorité des marchés financiers" (Authority of financial markets) derives its authority from the "Loi sur l'Autorité des marchés financiers" (Financial Market Authority Act). It is the result of the merger of the "Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec" (Québec Securities Commission - CVMQ), the [[Bureau des services financiers (Québec)]] (Financial Services Bureau - BSF), the [[Régie de l'assurance-dépôt du Québec]] (Québec Deposit Insurance Corporation) (RADQ), the [[Fonds d'indemnisation des services financiers]] (Financial Services Compensation Fund) (FISF) and the "Inspecteur general des institutions financières" (Inspector General of Financial Institutions) (IGIF).

The AMF was established by the [http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-107-36-2.html act 2002-45 of December 11, 2002] under the name of the "National Financial Sector Management Agency", in order to integrate the functions of the [[Bureau des services financiers (Québec)]] and the [[Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec]] (Securities Commission of Quebec), which were created by The laws [http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-107-36-2.html bill 2002-45 of December 11, 2002- 48 of 16 December 1982].

It was then renamed under its current name by the Act [http://www.assnat.qc.ca/fr/travaux-parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-72-37-1.html 2004-37 du 17 décember 2004].

The people who have served as AMF's president and CEO are: Jean Saint-Gelais (2004-2010), Mario Albert (2010-2013), Louis Morisset (2013-today).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lautorite.qc.ca/fr/louis-morisset-pdg-fr-corpo.html Biographical summary of Louis Morisset, published on AMF web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
In addition to the powers and responsibilities conferred on it by its incorporating legislation, the AMF oversees the enforcement of laws in each of the areas it regulates. It can also draw on self-regulatory organizations (SROs), to which certain regulatory powers are delegated.

The AMF is financially self-sufficient through the fees and dues paid by the persons and firms governed by the legislation it is charged with enforcing.

The AMF is headed by a President and Chief Executive Officer appointed by the government. In applying its governance rules, the AMF is supported by an Internal Auditor as well as an Advisory Board.

== Other mandates of the Authority ==
The "Autorité des marchés financiers" also administers the following mandates:
* Provides the required authorization for RVER (Régime volontaire d'épargne retraite) (VRSP - Voluntary Retirement Savings Plan) issuers and for companies wishing to enter into a public contract;
* Issue the required license to money service businesses;
* Gives permission to companies participating in a tendering or award process for public contracts and subcontracts;
* Seeks to implement the "Law on transparency measures in the mining, oil and gas industries";

== Registries administered by the AMF ==
The Authority permits public access to various registers:
* Register of individuals and businesses authorized to carry out various activities in Québec, such as insurance or administration of VRSP;
* Register of issuers subject to Québec securities;
* Register of insurers to which it grants the right to carry on insurance activities in Québec;
* Register of deposit-taking institutions: financial services cooperatives (caisses), trust companies and savings companies to which it grants the right to carry out activities in Québec;
* Register of enterprises that have been authorized to conclude public contracts and subcontracts;
* Register of legal entities authorized to act as administrator of a VRSP;
* Participatory financing portals operating under two types of plan: a registered dealer with the AMF or a participating financing scheme for start-ups.

==AMF in Canada==
'''Autorité des marchés financiers''' is one of two major securities regulators in Canada, the largest in Canada being the [[Ontario Securities Commission]]. The AMF regulates securities in the province of [[Quebec]]. The major exchange under its purview is the [[Montreal Exchange]].

'''BACnet''' is a [[communications protocol]] for Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks that leverage the [[ASHRAE]], [[ANSI]], and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16484-5 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | authorlink = ASHRAE
 | title = Standard 135-2016-- BACnet--A Data Communication Protocol for Building Automation and Control Networks (ANSI Approved)
 | date = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; protocol.

BACnet was designed to allow communication of [[building automation]] and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control ([[HVAC]]), lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform.

==History==
The development of the BACnet protocol began in June, 1987, in Nashville, Tennessee, at the inaugural meeting of the ASHRAE BACnet committee, known at that time as SPC 135P, "EMCS Message Protocol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bacnet.org/DL-Docs/SPC135-Nashville-Minutes-1987-06.pdf |title=Minutes of the First SPC 135P Meeting|author=SPC 135P |date=June 26, 1987|publisher=ASHRAE |access-date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee worked at reaching consensus using working groups to divide up the task of creating a standard. The working groups focused on specific areas and provided information and recommendations to the main committee. The first three working groups were the Data Type and Attribute Working Group, Primitive Data Format Working Group, and the Application Services Working Group.

BACnet became ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 135 in 1995, and [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37298 ISO 16484-5] in 2003. The Method of Test for Conformance to BACnet was published in 2003 as BSR/ASHRAE Standard 135.1. BACnet is under continuous maintenance by the ASHRAE Standing Standard Project Committee 135.

BACnet had an almost immediate impact on the [[HVAC]] controls industry. In 1996 [[Alerton]] announced a complete BACnet product line for HVAC controls, from the operator's workstation down to small [[variable air volume]] (VAV) controllers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbLQj6tWJzAC|title=BACnet|last=Newman|first=Michael|publisher=Momentum Press|year=2013|isbn=9781606502907|location=New York|pages=|chapter=2.9.1 ALERTON|oclc=909981984|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Automated Logic Corporation]] and Delta Controls soon followed suit. On July 12, 2017 BACnet reached a milestone with the issuance of the 1000th Vendor ID. Vendor IDs are assigned by ASHRAE and are distributed internationally. Those vendor identifiers can be viewed at [http://www.bacnet.org/VendorID/BACnet%20Vendor%20IDs.htm the BACnet website].

H. Michael (Mike) Newman, Manager of the Computer Section of the Utilities and Energy Management Department at [[Cornell University]], served as the BACnet committee chairman until June, 2000, when he was succeeded by his vice-chair of 13 years, Steven (Steve) Bushby from [[NIST]]. 

During Steve Bushby's four-year term as committee chair the BACnet standard was republished twice, in 2001 and 2004, each time with new capabilities added to the standard. The 2001 version featured, among other things, extensions to support fire / life-safety systems. 

In June, 2004, 17 years after the first BACnet meeting and back in Nashville, William (Bill) Swan (a.k.a. "BACnet Bill") from Alerton began his four-year stint as committee chair. During his term the number of committee working groups grew to 11, pursuing areas such as support for lighting, access control, energy utility/building integration and wireless communications.  

In January 2006 the BACnet Manufacturers Association and the BACnet Interest Group of North America combined their operation in a new organization called [http://www.bacnetinternational.org/ BACnet International].

In June 2008, in Salt Lake City, Dave Robin from Automated Logic Corporation took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair. During Dave's term, 22 addenda were published for the 135-2008 standard and republished as 135-2010. Several addenda were published for 135-2010 and the standard was republished as 135-2012. 

In June 2012, in San Antonio, Carl Neilson from Delta Controls took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair. During Carl's term, 12 addenda were published for the 135-2012 standard and the it was republished as 135-2016. Carl stepped down as chair in June 2015.  

In June 2015, Bernhard Isler, from Siemens, became chair after serving 3 years as vice chair and 4 years as secretary. During Bernhard's term, 10 addenda were published for the 135-2016 standard. Once addenda to 135.1-2013 was also published. Bernhard stepped down as chair in June 2018.

In June 2018, Michael Osborne from Reliable Controls, became chair after serving 3 years as secretary and 3 years as vice chair.

==Protocol overview==
The BACnet protocol defines a number of services that are used to communicate between building devices. The protocol services include Who-Is, I-Am, Who-Has, I-Have, which are used for Device and Object discovery. Services such as Read-Property and Write-Property are used for data sharing. As of ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2016, the BACnet protocol defines 60 object types that are acted upon by the services. 

The BACnet protocol defines a number of data link / physical layers, including [[ARCNET]], [[Ethernet]], BACnet/IP, BACnet/IPv6, [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Point-To-Point]] over [[RS-232]], Master-Slave/Token-Passing over [[RS-485]], [[ZigBee]], and [[LonTalk]].

==BACnet objects==

==BACnet testing==
BACnet Testing Laboratories ("BTL") was established by BACnet International to test products as per BACnet standard and support compliance testing and interoperability testing activities and consists of BTL Manager and the BTL working group ("BTL-WG").
The general activities of the BTL are:
*Publish the BTL Implementation Guidelines document
*Certifying the products as per BACnet testing and BTL guidelines
*Support the activities of the BTL-WG
*Maintain the BTL test packages
*Approves Testing Laboratories for BTL Testing
The BTL also provides testing services through BACnet Laboratories. The BTL Managers and BTL working groups of BACnet International administer the test Laboratories. All BTL-recognized BACnet Test Organizations are [[ISO 17025]] accredited.

In January, 2017, a new BTL certification program was announced. Under this program, the work of the BTL and WSPCert (the European BACnet certification body) is merged. This merger forms a single point of testing for both the BTL Mark and the Certificate of Conformance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5137">A '''blue roof''' is a roof design that is explicitly intended to store water, typically rainfall.  Blue roofs that are used for temporary rooftop storage can be classified as "active" or "passive" depending on the types of control devices used to regulate drainage of water from the roof. A number of blue roof pilot projects have been implemented around the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roofing and Plumbing Solutions|url=http://www.continuumoflearning.com/the-advantages-of-opting-for-blue-roofing-systems/|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active blue roofs for storm water  detention using forecast integration were first proposed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Directions in Real-Time and Dynamic Control for Stormwater Management and Low Impact Development|url=http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/40976(316)29|accessdate=February 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Active blue roofs are sometimes referred to as ''automated roof runoff management systems''.

== Blue roofs and stormwater collection ==
Recent work on blue roofs have involved pilot projects using stormwater collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYC.gov Blue Roof|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/stormwater/green_pilot_project_ps118.shtml|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Blue roofs can provide a number of benefits depending on design. These benefits include temporary storage of rainfall to mitigate runoff impacts, storage for reuse such as irrigation or cooling water makeup, or recreational opportunities. Blue roofs can include open water surfaces, storage within or beneath a porous media or modular surface, or below a raised decking surface or cover.

A significant blue roof pilot project intended to evaluate the potential of the systems for mitigating combined sewer overflow impacts was conducted between 2010 and 2012 by the [[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]]. The NYCDEP blue-roof projects are the first to utilize a novel passive blue roof tray design which relies on the lateral transitivity of non-woven filter fabric for drawdown control in a full scale pilot. Monitoring of these systems has demonstrated their performance as an effective means for mitigation of peak flows and alteration of timing in combined sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roofing Magazine|url=http://www.roofingmagazine.com/?s=geosyntec|accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue roofs are often privately owned, and make efficient use of the otherwise very limited space available in the urban core of a highly populated city.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Some recreational blue roofs integrate rooftop waterplay areas that can also be used to irrigate a [[green roof]], or to cool the roof of a building on hot days, in order to eliminate or at least reduce the [[HVAC]] load placed on mechanical refrigeration equipment.

Some blue roofs utilize stored water for beneficial on-site purposes cooling of solar panels and irrigation of a green roof.  One example of a blue roof that provide ancillary services was the winning entry (First Place, 10,000 Euro prize) in the 2004 Coram Sustainable Design Award, by [[Steve Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.experientialdesignlab.com/projects/auxiliary-projects/blue-roof|title=Blue Roof|last=|first=|date=December 17, 2004|website=Experiential Design Lab|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Egyptian blue pigment and roof temperatures ==
A different type of "blue roof" has been proposed by researchers at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], who researched a pigment used by the ancient Egyptians known as "[[Egyptian blue]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heatisland.lbl.gov/news/article/egyptian-blue-energy-efficiency|title=Egyptian Blue for Energy Efficiency|last=|first=|date=October 9, 2018|website=Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Heat Island Group|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/egyptian-blue-artificial-pigment-solar-energy-1366508-2018-10-11|title=World's 1st artificially-made pigment Egyptian blue, can help produce solar energy|last=|first=|date=October 11, 2018|website=India Today|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This color, derived from derived from calcium copper silicate, absorbs visible light, and emits light in the near-infrared range, helping keep roofs and walls cool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/10/11/scientists-give-solar-pv-a-paint-job/|title=Scientists give solar PV a paint job|last=|first=|date=October 9, 2018|website=PV magazine USA|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Extensive media attention and public criticism has been directed at [[the Bronx]]'s [[New York City Courts|court system]], due to delays in bringing cases to trial, which are seen by critics as a clear infringement of defendants' constitutional right to a [[speedy trial]].

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the Bronx court system had 3,880 felony cases awaiting trial as of November 2013, of which 397 were older than two years.&lt;ref name=mckinley&gt;{{cite news|last=McKinley Jr.|first=James C.|title=Bronx Courts Make Gains in Reducing Case Backlog|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/nyregion/bronx-courts-make-gains-in-reducing-case-backlog.html?_r=0|accessdate=19 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=11 December 2013|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This accounted for over 47% of the total open felony cases older than two years in the New York City court system.  Accused persons who are denied bail must remain in jail while awaiting trial, with some spending five years or more in pre-trial detention.&lt;ref&gt;

One factor may be the economic condition of the Bronx, which is cumulatively the poorest of New York City's [[borough (New York City)|borough]], thereby lacking "political clout to stir outrage and force reform".&lt;ref name=wilglab /&gt; Some critics contend that high numbers of arrests in the borough, particularly for misdemeanor offenses, are the underlying source of the problem.&lt;ref name=mckinley /&gt;  Others believe that criminal attorneys deliberately delay trial proceedings, for example by routinely showing up late, or by employing time-wasting cross-examinations.&lt;ref name=wilglab/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Chicago B. &amp; Q.R. Co. v. Krayenbuhl''''' 65 Neb. 899, 91 [[North Western Reporter|N.W.]] 880 (1902), was a case that established [[Negligence|negligent liability]] on a railroad company.

The appellant maintained a [[Turntable (rail)|railway turntable]] (a rotating platform with a track for turning a locomotive) near a publicly traveled path. The appellee, a 4 year old child of the Krayenbuhl family, discovered that the turntable was unlocked, climbed on it, and while playing on it with a group of children got his foot caught between the rails, which severed it at the ankle joint.  

The [[Supreme Court of Nebraska]] held that it was negligent for [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] not to keep the turntable locked and guarded. They noted that the business of railroading is facilitated by the use of turntables, so it would go against the public good to require the appellant to invest so heavily in safeguards that it interfered with appellant's ability to use the turntables for their intended, beneficial use. However, the burden of keeping the turntable locked was so small that the danger of not doing so outweighed the burden.

'''Circles of Sustainability''' is a method for understanding and assessing [[sustainability]], and for managing projects directed towards socially sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to handle 'seemingly intractable problems'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as outlined in [[sustainable development]] debates. The method is mostly used for cities and urban settlements.

Circles of Sustainability, and its treatment of the social domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture, provides the empirical dimension of an approach called '[[engaged theory]]'. Developing Circles of Sustainability is part of larger project called 'Circles of Social Life', using the same four-domain model to analyze questions of resilience, adaptation, security, reconciliation. It is also being used in relation to thematics such as 'Circles of Child Wellbeing' (with World Vision).

The rationale for this new method is clear. As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli (2012) and Medellin (2014), sustainability assessment is on the global agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672|accessdate=September 9, 2012|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911065400/http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672#|archive-date=11 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more complex the problems, the less useful current sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Paul James, Andy Scerri, ‘Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach’, Applied Research in the Quality of Life, vol. 7, no. 3., 2012, pp. 239–61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Triple Bottom Line]] approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality. Secondly, the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues. Thirdly, the size, scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation. Fourthly, the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settings—corporations and other institutions, cities, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Andy Scerri, Paul James, Lin Padgham, James Thom, Hepu Deng, Sarah Hickmott, and Felicity Cahill, ‘Reframing Sustainability Reporting: Towards an Engaged Approach’, Environment, Development and Sustainability, vol. 15, no. 1, 2013, pp. 225–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Most indicator approaches, such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031, have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries. Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations.

==History==
The method began with a fundamental dissatisfaction with current approaches to [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which tended to treat economics as the core domain and ecology as an externality. Two concurrent developments provided impetus: a major project in Porto Alegre, and a United Nations’ paper called ''Accounting for Sustainability'', Briefing Paper, No. 1, 2008. The researchers developed a method and an integrated set of tools for assessing and monitoring issues of sustainability while providing guidance for project development.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCarthy, Paul James and Carolines Bayliss, eds, ''Sustainable Cities, Vol. 1'', United Nations Global Compact, Cities Programme, New York and Melbourne, 2010, 134pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The method was then further refined through projects in Melbourne and Milwaukee, and through an ARC-funded cross-disciplinary project&lt;ref&gt;‘Semantic Technologies to Help Machines Understand Us: Fuji Xerox leads RMIT to $1.4m Grant for Real-Time Green Reports’, ''IT Business'', 30 October 2009.

However, unlike this system, the Canadian index data-sets are focused on measuring the physical footprints of human activity and greenspace footprints which are less subjectivity than cultural and economic&lt;ref&gt;‘Subjectivity in Economics’, ''SSRN'', June 1, 2012. Matthew T. Clements, ‘Abstract: Economics cannot claim to be absolutely objective...’,''St. Edward's University'', &lt;/ref&gt; indicators.

==Use of the method==
The method is used by a series of global organizations including the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme, The World Association of Major Metropolises,&lt;ref&gt;The methodology was used by Metropolis for Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the ‘Circles of Sustainability’ methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice. (See http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |date=19 August 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Vision]] to support their engagement in cities. It is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles (e.g., Hyderabad, Johannesburg, Melbourne, New Delhi, São Paulo and Tehran). It is a method for understanding [[urban politics]] and [[urban planning]], as well as for conducting [[sustainability]] analysis and profiling [[sustainable development]].

===Global Compact Cities Programme===
The methodology is made available by UN Global Compact Cities Programme for its engagement with its more than 80 Signatory Cities. In particular, some of the 14 Innovating Cities in the programme have influenced the development of the Circles of Sustainability method through their management of major projects, some with intensity and others as a background feature. They use a cross-sectoral and holistic approach for developing a response to self-defined seemingly intractable problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Porto Alegre, Vila Chocolatão project====

The Vila Chocolatão project refers to the 2011 resettlement of approximately 1,000 residents of the inner-city Vila Chocolatão slum in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil. The resettlement project of Vila Chocolatão commenced in 2000 in response to an imminent eviction of the community, with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown [[participatory budgeting]] system. The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group, the Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network. The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court, TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolatão Residents Association, local government departments, federal agencies, non-government organisations and the corporate sector. The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipality’s Local Solidarity Governance Scheme. In 2006, the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement.

This long-standing collaborative project has been successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers, it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums. The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site, Residencial Nova Chocolatão, linked to the garbage-collection process of the city (an example of linking the sub-domains of ‘emission and waste’ and ‘organization and governance’); and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community. The Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement.  This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements.

====Milwaukee, water sustainability project====

In 2009, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America, wanted to address the issue of water quality in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Milwaukee Business Journal'', 29 April 2009; John Schmid, ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Circles of Sustainability methodology became the basis for an integrated city project. In the period of the application of the method (2009–present) there has been a rediscovery of the value of water from an industry and broader community perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities/americas/usa/milwaukee |title=Milwaukee - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Milwaukee won the United States Water Prize given by the Clean Water America Alliance, as well as a prize from IBM Better Cities program worth $500,000. The community has also attracted some leading water treatment innovators and is establishing a graduate School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/ |title=UN Global Compact &amp;#124; Milwaukee Water Council |work=thewatercouncil.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815005612/http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/# |archive-date=15 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolis (World  Association of the Major Metropolises)===
The methodology was first used by Metropolis for ''Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth''. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the Circles of Sustainability methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions |title=Publications / Commissions &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |archive-date=19 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the research team were invited by Metropolis to work with the Victorian Government and the Cities Programme on one of their major initiatives. The methodology is central to the approach used by the ‘Integrated Strategic Planning and Public-Private Partnerships Initiative’ organized by Metropolis, 2012–2013 for Indian, Brazilian and Iranian cities. A workshop was held in New Delhi, 26–27 July 2012, and senior planners from New Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata used the two of the assessment tools in the Circles of Sustainability toolbox to map the sustainability of their cities as part of developing their urban-regional plans. Other cities to use the same tools have been Tehran (in relation to their mega-projects plan) and São Paulo (in relation to their macro-metropolitan plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metropolis.org/news/metropolis-initiative-integrated--1 |title=Metropolis Initiative "Integrated Strategic Planning and Public Private Partnerships" meets in New Delhi &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the Cities Programme and Metropolis have worked together to refine the 'Circles of Sustainability' method to use with their respective member cities. A Metropolis Taskforce was charged with further developing the method.

===''The Economist''===
In 2011, ''The Economist'' invited [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] (Director of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme) and Chetan Vedya (Director, National Institute of Urban Affairs, India) into a debate around the question of urban sustainability and metropolitan growth. It led to over 200 letters to the editor in direct response as well as numerous linked citations on other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/debate/overview/192 |title=Economist Debates: Cities |work=economist.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Vision===
In 2011, recognising how much the two processes of urbanization and globalization were changing the landscape of poverty, [[World Vision]] decided to shift its orientation towards urban settings. Previously 80 per cent of its projects had been in small rural communities. The Circles of Sustainability method now underpins that reorientation and pilot studies are being conducted in India, South Africa, Lebanon, Indonesia and elsewhere, to refine the methodology for aid delivery in complex urban settings.

==Domains and subdomains==
The Circles of Sustainability approach is explicitly critical of other domain models such as the [[triple bottom line]] that treat economics as if it is outside the social, or that treat the environment as an externality. It uses a four-domain model - economics, ecology, politics and culture. In each of these domains there are 7 subdomains.

===Economics===
The economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production, use, and management of resources, where the concept of ‘resources’ is used in the broadest sense of that word.
# Production and resourcing
# Exchange and transfer
# Accounting and regulation
# Consumption and use
# Labour and welfare
# Technology and infrastructure
# Wealth and distribution

===Ecology===
The ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms, focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature, but also including the built-environment.
# Materials and energy
# Water and air
# Flora and fauna
# Habitat and settlements
# Built-form and transport
# Embodiment and sustenance
# Emission and waste

===Politics===
The political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power, such as organization, authorization, legitimation and regulation. The parameters of this area extend beyond the conventional sense of politics to include not only issues of public and private governance but more broadly social relations in general.
# Organization and governance
# Law and justice
# Communication and critique
# Representation and negotiation
# Security and accord
# Dialogue and reconciliation
# Ethics and accountability

===Culture===
The cultural domain is defined as the practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.
# Identity and engagement
# Creativity and recreation
# Memory and projection
# Belief and ideas
# Gender and generations
# Enquiry and learning
# Wellbeing and health

The '''Clean Water Act (CWA)''' is the primary [[federal law]] in the [[United States]] governing [[water pollution]]. Its objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters by preventing point and nonpoint pollution sources, providing assistance to publicly owned treatment works for the improvement of [[wastewater treatment]], and maintaining the integrity of [[wetlands]]. It is one of the United States' first and most influential modern [[environmental law]]s. As with many other major [[United States environmental law|U.S. federal environmental statutes]], it is administered by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), in coordination with state governments. Its implementing regulations are codified at [[Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations|40 C.F.R.]] Subchapters D, N, and O (Parts 100-140, 401-471, and 501-503).

Technically, the name of the law is the '''Federal Water Pollution Control Act'''.&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act Summary of the Clean Water Act] ("Clean Water Act" is the law's "common name," including link to Senate version of the Act with proper title).&lt;/ref&gt; The first '''FWPCA''' was enacted in 1948, but took on its modern form when completely rewritten in 1972 in an act entitled the '''Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972'''.&lt;ref&gt;
United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. [http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf Pub.L. 92-500], October 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rinde|first1=Meir|title=Richard Nixon and the Rise of American Environmentalism |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1|pages=16–29|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/richard-nixon-and-the-rise-of-american-environmentalism|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major changes have subsequently been introduced via amendatory legislation including the '''Clean Water Act of 1977'''&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act of 1977. [http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf Pub.L. 95-217], December 27, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Water Quality Act of 1987.'''&lt;ref&gt;Water Quality Act of 1987. [http://www.epw.senate.gov/water.pdf Pub.L. 100-4], February 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clean Water Act does not directly address [[groundwater contamination]]. [[Groundwater]] protection provisions are included in the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]], [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]], and the [[Superfund]] act.

==Background==
=== Health implications of water pollution ===
Contamination of [[drinking water]] supplies can not only occur in the source water but also in the distribution system. Sources of water contamination include naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. Some examples of health implications of water contamination are gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-human-health |title=The Effects: Human Health |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gastrointestinal illness ====
[[Gastrointestinal disease|Gastrointestinal disorders]] include such conditions as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, perianal abscesses, anal fistulas, perianal infections, diverticular diseases, colitis, colon polyps and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/gastrointestinal-disorders|title=Digestive Disorders &amp; Gastrointestinal Diseases {{!}} Cleveland Clinic|website=Cleveland Clinic|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in [[turbidity]] being associated with a 9% increase). The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=J.|last2=Levin|first2=R.|last3=Goldstein|first3=R.|date=2017-04-24|title=Drinking water turbidity and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia|pmc=1731533|journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health|volume=54|issue=1|pages=45–51|doi=10.1136/jech.54.1.45|issn=0143-005X|pmid=10692962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reproductive problems ====
Reproductive problems refer to any illness of the [[reproductive system]]. New research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter strengthens the relationship between water pollution and rising male fertility problems. Study identified a group of chemicals that act as anti-androgens in polluted water, which inhibits the function of the male hormone, testosterone, reducing male fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090118200636.htm|title=Declining Male Fertility Linked To Water Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sciencedaily.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neurological disorders ====
[[Neurological disorder]]s are diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. The new study of more than 700 people in California’s Central Valley found that those who likely consumed contaminated private well water had a higher rate of Parkinson’s. The risk was 90 percent higher for those who had private wells near fields sprayed with widely used insecticides. Unlike water supplies in large cities, private wells are mostly unregulated and are not monitored for contaminants. Many of them exist at shallow depths of less than 20 yards, and some of the crop chemicals used to kill pests and weeds can flow into ground water. Therefore, private wells are likely to contain pesticides, which can attack developing brains (womb or infancy), leading to neurological diseases later in life. A study led by UCLA epidemiology professor Beate Ritz suggests that "people with Parkinson’s were more likely to have consumed private well water, and had consumed it on average 4.3 years longer than those who did not have the disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rural-well-water-insecticides-parkinsons-disease-california/|title=Rural Well Water Linked to Parkinson's Disease|last=News|first=Marla Cone, Environmental Health|work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Future section: === Ecological implications of water pollution === --&gt;

==Waters protected==
All waters with a "significant nexus" to "navigable waters" are covered under the CWA; however, the phrase "significant nexus" remains open to judicial interpretation and considerable controversy. The 1972 statute frequently uses the term "navigable waters" but also defines the term as "waters of the United States, including the territorial seas."&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act (CWA) section 502 (7); {{USC|33|1362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some regulations interpreting the 1972 law have included water features such as [[intermittent stream]]s, [[playa lake]]s, [[prairie pothole]]s, [[marsh|sloughs]] and [[wetland]]s as "waters of the United States." In 2006, in ''[[Rapanos v. United States]]'', a [[Plurality opinion|plurality]] of the [[US Supreme Court]] held that the term "waters of the United States" "includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographic features' that are described in ordinary parlance as 'streams[,]... oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.'"

== Pollution control strategy ==
[[File:Common Point Source Discharges - EPA 2010.png|thumb|Common point source discharges]]

=== Point sources ===
The CWA introduced the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which is a permit system for regulating [[point source]]s of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, D.C. [http://www.epa.gov/npdes "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System."] Updated 2017-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Point sources include:
* industrial facilities (including [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[ship transport|shipping activities]], [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas extraction]]&lt;ref&gt;Some oil and gas extraction wastestreams were later exempted from regulations. ''See'' EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/npdes/oil-and-gas-stormwater-permitting "Oil and Gas Stormwater Permitting."] Updated 2016-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[service industries]]).
* [[Local government in the United States|municipal government]]s (particularly [[sewage treatment plants]]) and other government facilities (such as [[List of United States military bases|military bases]]), and
* some [[agricultural]] facilities, such as animal [[feedlot]]s.
Point sources may not discharge pollutants to surface waters without a permit from the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). That system is managed by the [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in partnership with state environmental agencies. EPA has authorized 47 [[US state|states]] to issue permits directly to the discharging facilities. The CWA also allows [[federally recognized tribes|tribes]] to issue permits, but no tribes have been authorized by EPA. In the remaining states and [[United States territory|territories]], the permits are issued by an EPA regional office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018-08-20 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See Titles [[#Title III - Standards and enforcement|III]] and [[#Title IV - Permits and licenses|IV]].)

In previous legislation, [[United States Congress|Congress]] had authorized states to develop water quality standards, which would limit discharges from facilities based on the characteristics of individual water bodies. However, those standards were to be developed only for interstate waters, and the science to support that process (i.e. data, methodology) was in the early stages of development. That system was not effective, and there was no permit system in place to enforce the requirements. In the 1972 CWA, Congress added the permit system and a requirement for technology-based effluent limitations.&lt;ref name="Kovalic"&gt;Water Pollution Control Foundation. "The Clean Water Act of 1987." Joan M. Kovalic et al. Alexandria, VA, 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-943244-40-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Technology-based standards ====
The 1972 CWA created a new requirement for technology-based standards for point source discharges. The EPA develops those standards for categories of dischargers, based on the performance of [[List of waste water treatment technologies|pollution control technologies]] without regard to the conditions of a particular receiving [[water body]]. The intent of Congress was to create a "level playing field" by establishing a basic national discharge standard for all facilities within a category, using a "[[Best Available Technology]]." The standard becomes the minimum regulatory requirement in a permit. If the national standard is not sufficiently protective at a particular location, then water quality standards may be employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2010 |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual-0 |publisher=EPA |pages=1-3—1-5 |id=EPA-833-K-10-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water quality standards ====
The 1972 act authorized continued use of the water quality-based approach, but in coordination with the technology-based standards. After application of technology-based standards to a permit, if [[water quality]] is still impaired for the particular water body, then the permit agency (state or EPA) may add water quality-based limitations to that permit. The additional limitations are to be more stringent than the technology-based limitations and would require the permittee to install additional controls. Water quality standards consist of four basic elements: 1) Designated uses; 2) Water quality criteria; 3) Antidegradation policy and 4) General policies.&lt;ref name=quality&gt;{{cite web |title=What are Water Quality Standards? |author=EPA |date=2015-10-27 |url=http://www.epa.gov/standards-water-body-health/what-are-water-quality-standards |website=Standards for Water Body Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Designated uses=====
According to water quality standard regulations, federally recognized tribes/nations and states are required to specify appropriate water uses. Identification of appropriate water uses takes into consideration the usage and value of public water supply, protection of fish, wildlife, recreational waters, agricultural, industrial and navigational water ways. Suitability of a water body is examined by states and tribes/nations usages based on physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. States and tribes/nations also examine geographical settings, scenic qualities and economic considerations to determine fitness of designated uses for water bodies. If those standards indicate designated uses to be less than those currently attained, states or tribes are required to revise standards to reflect the uses thaf are actually being attained. For any body of water with designated uses that do not include "fishable/swimmable" target use that is identified in section 101(a)(2) of CWA, a "Use Attainability Analysis" must be conducted. Every three years, such bodies of water must be re-examined to verify if new information is available that demand a revision of the standard. If new information is available that specify “fishable/swimmable” uses can be attained, the use must be designated.&lt;ref name=quality /&gt;

=====Water quality criteria=====
Federally recognized Indigenous Nations and states protect designated areas by adopting water quality criteria that the EPA publishes under §304(a) of the CWA, modifying the §304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopting criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as a basis for limiting the toxicity of waste discharges to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on the aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body. A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment, and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments in order to avoid undesirable effects.&lt;ref name=quality /&gt;

=====Anti-degradation policy=====
Water quality standards consist of an anti-degradation policy that requires states and tribes to establish a three-tiered anti-degradation program. Anti-degradation procedures identify steps and questions that need to be addressed when specific activities affect water quality. Tier 1 is applicable to all surface waters. It maintains and protects current uses and water quality conditions to support existing uses. Current uses are identified by showing that fishing, swimming, and other water uses have occurred and are suitable since November 28, 1975. Tier 2 maintains and protects water bodies with existing conditions that are better to support CWA 101(a)(2) "fishable/swimmable" uses. Tier 3 maintains and protects water quality in outstanding national resource waters (ONRWs), which are the highest quality waters in the US with ecological significance.&lt;ref name=quality /&gt;

=====General policies=====
States and Indian tribes adopt general policies pertaining to water quality standards that are subject to review and approval by the EPA. Those provisions on water quality standards include mixing zones, variance, and low flow policies. Mixing zone policy is defined area surrounding a point source discharge where sewage is diluted by water. Methodology of mixing zone procedure determines the location, size, shape and quality of mixing zones. Variance policy temporarily relax water quality standard and are alternatives to removing a designated use. States and tribes may include variance as part of their water quality standard. Variance is subject to public review every three years and warrant development towards improvement of water quality. Low Flow policy pertains to states and tribes water quality standards that identify procedures applied to determining critical low flow conditions.&lt;ref name=quality /&gt;

=== Nonpoint sources ===
[[File:Percentages sources of pollution that impair water bodies.gif|thumb|right|[[Nonpoint source pollution|Nonpoint source pollutants]], such as sediments, nutrients, pesticides, fertilizers and animal wastes, account for more than half of the pollution in U.S. waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continued Strengthening of the Clean Water Act Reflects the Public's Concern for Clean Water |website=Riparian Forest Buffers: Function and Design for Protection and Enhancement of Water Resources |id=NA-PR-07-91 |author=U.S. Forest Service, Northeastern Area |location=Radnor, PA |url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/n_resource/buffer/part3.htm |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Congress exempted some water pollution sources from the point source definition in the 1972 CWA and was unclear on the status of some other sources. Such sources were therefore considered to be [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint sources]] that were not subject to the permit program.

Agricultural stormwater discharges and irrigation [[return flow]]s were specifically exempted from permit requirements.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 502(14), {{USC|33|1362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress, however, provided support for research, technical and financial assistance programs at the U.S. [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] to improve runoff management practices on farms. ''See'' [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]].
[[File:National Map of Regulated MS4s 2009.png|thumb|Map of municipal separate storm sewer systems]]
[[Stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] from industrial sources, municipal [[storm drains]], and other sources were not specifically addressed in the 1972 law. The EPA declined to include [[urban runoff]] and industrial stormwater discharges in the NPDES program and so was sued by an [[environmental group]]. In 1977, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that stormwater discharges must be covered by the permit program.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural Resources Defense Council v. Train,'' 396 F.Supp. 1393 (D.D.C. 1975), aff'd. by ''NRDC v. Costle,'' 568 F.2d 1369 (D.C. Cir. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted starting in the late 1970s and 1980s indicated that stormwater runoff was a significant cause of water quality impairment in many parts of the US. In the early 1980s, the EPA conducted the [[Nationwide Urban Runoff Program]] (NURP) to document the extent of the urban stormwater problem. The agency began to develop regulations for stormwater permit coverage but encountered resistance from industry and municipalities, and there were additional rounds of litigation. The litigation was pending when Congress considered further amendments to the CWA in 1986.

In the Water Quality Act of 1987, Congress responded to the stormwater problem by defining [[industrial stormwater]] dischargers and municipal separate [[storm sewer]] systems (often called "MS4") as point sources, and requiring them to obtain NPDES permits, by specific deadlines. The permit exemption for agricultural discharges continued, but Congress created several programs and grants, including a demonstration grant program at the EPA to expand the research and development of non point controls and management practices.&lt;ref name="EPA-NPS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nps |title=Polluted Runoff: Nonpoint Source Pollution |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-10-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financing of pollution controls ===
Congress created a major public works financing program for municipal sewage treatment in the 1972 CWA. A system of [[grant (money)|grants]] for construction of municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants was authorized and funded in [[#Title II - Grants for Construction of Treatment Works|Title II]]. In the initial program, the federal portion of each grant was up to 75 percent of a facility's [[capital cost]], with the remainder financed by the state. In subsequent amendments Congress reduced the federal proportion of the grants and in the 1987 WQA transitioned to a revolving loan program in [[#Title VI - State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds|Title VI]]. Industrial and other private facilities are required to finance their own treatment improvements on the "polluter pays" principle.

==== Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act ====
Congress passed the '''Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014''' (WIFIA) to provide an expanded credit program for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with broader eligibility criteria than the previously-authorized revolving fund unter CWA Title VI.&lt;ref name=WIFIA&gt;United States. Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014. {{USPL|113|121}}, title V, §5022. Approved 2014-06-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to WIFIA, EPA established its Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center in 2015 to help local governments and municipal utilities design innovative financing mechanisms, including [[public–private partnership]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Learn About the WIFIA Program |url=https://www.epa.gov/wifia/learn-about-wifia-program |date=2017-03-21 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress amended the WIFIA program in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;United States.&lt;br&gt;1.

Approved 2016-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major statutory provisions ==
This Act has six titles.

=== Title I - Research and Related Programs ===
Title I includes a ''Declaration of Goals and Policy''&lt;ref&gt;CWA 101, {{USC|33|1251}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and various grant authorizations for research programs and pollution control programs.  Some of the programs authorized by the 1972 law are ongoing (e.g. section 104 research programs, section 106 pollution control programs, section 117 [[Chesapeake Bay Program]]) while other programs no longer receive funds from Congress and have been discontinued.

=== Title II - Grants for Construction of Treatment Works ===
To assist municipalities in creating or expanding sewage treatment plants, also known as [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW), Title II established a system of construction grants. The 1972 CWA provided that federal funds would support 75% of project costs, with state and local funds providing the remaining 25%. In 1981 Congress reduced the federal funding proportion for most grants to 55%.&lt;ref name="Copeland-infrastructure"&gt;{{cite report |last=Copeland |first=Claudia |date=2012-04-05 |title=Water Infrastructure Financing: History of EPA Appropriations |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/96-647.pdf |publisher=U.S. Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} &lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act Amendments of 1981, {{uspl|97|117}}, Sec. 7. Approved 1981-12-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction grant program was replaced by the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]] in the 1987 WQA (''see'' [[#Title VI - State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds|Title VI]]), although some local utilities continued to receive "special purpose project grants" directly from Congress, through a budgetary procedure known as "[[Earmark (politics)|earmarking]]."&lt;ref name="Copeland-infrastructure"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Title III - Standards and enforcement ===

====Discharge permits required====
Section 301 of the Act prohibits discharges to waters of the U.S. except with a permit.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 301(a), {{USC|33|1311(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
(''See'' [[#Title IV - Permits and licenses|Title IV]] for discussion of permit programs.) Recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements, but vessel operators must implement [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] to control their discharges.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 402(r), {{USC|33|1342(r)}}. This provision was added by the [[Clean Boating Act of 2008]], {{USPL|110|288}}, July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (''See'' [[Regulation of ship pollution in the United States]].)

==== Technology-Based Standards Program ====
Under the 1972 act EPA began to issue technology-based standards for municipal and industrial sources.
* Municipal sewage treatment plants (POTW) are required to meet [[secondary treatment]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 304(d)(1), {{USC|33|1314(d)(1)}} and [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2007-title40-vol21/pdf/CFR-2007-title40-vol21-part133-toc-id471.pdf "Secondary Treatment Regulation"], ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Effluent guidelines]] (for existing sources) and [[New Source Performance Standard]]s (NSPS) are issued for categories of industrial facilities discharging directly to surface waters.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 301, {{USC|33|1311}}; CWA 304(b), {{USC|33|1314(b)}}; and CWA 306, {{USC|33|1316}}. Regulations at [https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d69f81dc5b3d34697337675d4f0a6b13&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40CIsubchapN.tpl 40 CFR Subchapter N].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Categorical Pretreatment Standards are issued to industrial users (also called "indirect dischargers") contributing wastes to POTW.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 307(b), {{USC|33|1317(b)}}; and CWA 307(c), {{USC|33|1317(c)}}. [https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=d69f81dc5b3d34697337675d4f0a6b13&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title40/40CIsubchapN.tpl 40 CFR Subchapter N].&lt;/ref&gt; These standards are developed in conjunction with the effluent guidelines program. As with effluent guidelines and NSPS, pretreatment standards consists of Pretreatment Standards for Existing Sources (PSES) and Pretreatment Standards for New Sources (PSNS). There are 28 categories with pretreatment standards as of 2018.

To date, the effluent guidelines and categorical pretreatment standards regulations have been published for 59 categories and apply to approximately 40,000 facilities that discharge directly to the nation's waters, 129,000 facilities that discharge to POTWs, and construction sites. These regulations are responsible for preventing the discharge of almost 700 billion pounds of pollutants each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/effluent-guidelines-plan |title=Effluent Guidelines Plan |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-05-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has updated some categories since their initial promulgation and has added new categories.

The secondary treatment standards for POTWs and the effluent guidelines are implemented through NPDES permits. (See [[#Title IV - Permits and licenses|Title IV]].)  The categorical pretreatment standards are typically implemented by POTWs through permits that they issue to their industrial users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=June 2011 |title=Introduction to the National Pretreatment Program |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-introduction-national-pretreatment-program |publisher=EPA |id=833-B-11-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water Quality Standards Program ====
Water quality standards (WQS) are risk-based requirements which set site-specific allowable pollutant levels for individual water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. States set WQS by designating uses for the water body (e.g., recreation, water supply, aquatic life, agriculture) and applying water quality criteria (numeric pollutant concentrations and narrative requirements) to protect the designated uses. An antidegradation policy is also issued by each state to maintain and protect existing uses and high quality waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2010 |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual-0 |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 6. Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations |id=EPA-833-K-10-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a state fails to issue WQS, EPA is required to issue standards for that state.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 303(b), {{USC|33|1313(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water bodies that do not meet applicable water quality standards with technology-based controls alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not meeting standards. Water bodies on the 303(d) list require development of a [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] (TMDL). A TMDL is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet WQS.  The TMDL is determined after study of the specific properties of the water body and the pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS)  Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half.

Following the issuance of a TMDL for a water body, implementation of the requirements involves modification to NPDES permits for facilities discharging to the water body to meet the WLA allocated to the water body (see [[#Title IV - Permits and licenses|Title IV]]).

As of 2007, approximately half of the rivers, lakes, and bays under EPA oversight were not safe enough for fishing and swimming.&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio.
[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10231441 ''Cities Battle Over River's Pollution Level.''] Susan Sharon. May 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of WQS and TMDL is a complex process, both scientifically and legally, and it is a resource-intensive process for state agencies.

==== National Water Quality Inventory ====
The primary mode of informing the quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands of the U.S. is through the ''National Water Quality Inventory Report.'' Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress as a means to inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes.&lt;ref name="EPA WQI"&gt;{{cite web|title=The National Water Quality Inventory Report to Congress|author=EPA|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CWA 305(b), {{USC|33|1315(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act. The report is organized into two major sections; Section 1 shows national assessment of each type of water body, with causes and sources identified. Section 2 summarizes recommendations on improvement of water resource management.&lt;ref name="EPA WQI"/&gt;

==== Enforcement ====
Under section 309, EPA can issue administrative orders against violators, and seek civil or criminal penalties when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 309, {{USC|33|1319}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*For a first offense of criminal negligence, the minimum fine is $2,500, with a maximum of $25,000 fine per day of violation. A violator may also receive up to a year in jail. On a second offense, a maximum fine of $50,000 per day may be issued.
*For a knowing endangerment violation, i.e. placing another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury, a fine may be issued up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment up to 15 years for an individual, or up to $1,000,000 for an organization.
States that are authorized by EPA to administer the NPDES program must have authority to enforce permit requirements under their respective state laws.

==== Federal facilities ====
Military bases, national parks and other federal facilities must comply with CWA provisions.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 313, {{USC|33|1323}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thermal pollution ====
Section 316 requires standards for [[thermal pollution]] discharges, as well as standards for [[water cooling#Industrial usage|cooling water]] intake structures (e.g., [[fish screen]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|33|1326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These standards are applicable to [[power plant]]s and other industrial facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cooling-water-intakes |title=Cooling Water Intakes |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-04-26 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nonpoint Source Management Program ====
The 1987 amendments created the [[nonpoint source pollution|Nonpoint Source]] Management Program under CWA section 319.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|33|1329}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This program provides grants to states, territories and Indian tribes to support demonstration projects, [[technology transfer]], education, training, technical assistance and related activities designed to reduce nonpoint source pollution. Grant funding for the program averaged $210 million annually for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/owow/nps/319hhistory.html "Clean Water Act Section 319(h) Grant Funds History."] Accessed 2008-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title IV - Permits and licenses ===

====State certification of compliance====
States are required to certify that discharges authorized by federal permits will not violate the state's water quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 401, {{USC|33|1341}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== NPDES permits for point sources ====
The NPDES permits program is authorized by CWA section 402.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|33|1342}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial permits issued in the 1970s and early 1980s focused on POTWs and industrial wastewater—typically "process" wastewater and [[cooling water]] where applicable, and in some cases, industrial stormwater. The 1987 WQA expanded the program to cover [[stormwater]] discharges explicitly, both from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) and [[industrial stormwater|industrial sources]].&lt;ref&gt;CWA 402(p), {{USC|33|1342(p)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The MS4 NPDES permits require regulated municipalities to use [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] to reduce pollutants to the "Maximum Extent Practicable."

POTWs with [[combined sewer]]s are required to comply with the national ''Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy,'' published by EPA in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Wet Weather Quality Act of 2000, Section 112 of Division B, {{USPL|106|554}}, December 21, 2000. Added CWA section 402(q), {{USC|33|1342(q)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related pollution problems.&lt;ref name="CSO Policy"&gt;EPA (1994-04-19). [https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0111.pdf "Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy."] ''[[Federal Register]]'', 59 FR 18688.&lt;/ref&gt; About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflow-frequent-questions |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Frequent Questions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-stormwater permits typically include numeric effluent limitations for specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration allowed in the discharge, e.g., 30&amp;nbsp;mg/L of [[biochemical oxygen demand]]. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes a violation of the permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze [[wastewater]] samples), and submit [[Discharge Monitoring Report]]s to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2010 |title=NPDES Permit Writers' Manual |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual-0 |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 3. Overview of the NPDES Permitting Process |id=EPA-833-K-10-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, EPA estimated that there are over 500,000 stormwater permittees. This number includes permanent facilities such as municipal (POTW, MS4) and industrial plants, and construction sites, which are temporary stormwater dischargers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |author-last=Copeland |author-first=Claudia |date=2012-07-30 |title=Stormwater Permits: Status of EPA’s Regulatory Program |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-290.pdf |publisher=U.S. Congressional Research Service |location=Washington, D.C. |page=2 |id=97-290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dredge and fill exemptions ====
After passage of the CWA in 1972, a controversy arose as to its application to agriculture and certain other activities.  The Act was interpreted by some to place restrictions on virtually all placement of [[dredging|dredged]] materials in wetlands and other waters of the United States, raising concern that the federal government was about to place all agricultural activities under the jurisdiction of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE). For opponents of the Act, section 404 had, as a result of this concern, become a symbol of dramatic over-regulation.&lt;ref name="LegHist"&gt;U.S. Congress. Senate. Committee on Public Works (1978). "A Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977." Serial No. 95-14. Vol. 4. Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|901–903}} When Congress considered the 1977 CWA Amendments, a significant issue was to ensure that certain agricultural activities and other selected activities, could continue without the government’s supervision—in other words, completely outside the regulatory or permit jurisdiction of any federal agency.

The 1977 amendments included a set of six section 404 exemptions.  For example, totally new activities such as construction of farm roads, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(E), construction of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, and minor agricultural drainage, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(A), all are exempted by Statute.  Section 1344(f)(1)(C), which exempts discharge of dredged material “for the purpose of. . . the maintenance of drainage ditches.” All of these exemptions were envisioned to be self-executing, that is not technically requiring an administrative no-jurisdiction determination. One such example was the maintenance of agricultural drainage ditches.&lt;ref name="LegHist" /&gt;{{rp|906}} Throughout the hearing process, Congressmen of every environmental persuasion repeatedly stated that the over $5 Billion invested in drainage facilities could be maintained without government regulation of any kind.&lt;ref name="LegHist" /&gt;{{rp|906–912}} Senator [[Edmund Muskie]], for example, explained that exempt activities such as agricultural drainage would be entirely unregulated.&lt;ref name="LegHist" /&gt;{{rp|949}} Other exemptions were granted as well, including exemptions for normal farming activities.

=====Importance of no-jurisdiction determinations=====

Although Congress envisioned a set of self-executing exemptions, it has become common for landowners to seek no-jurisdiction determinations from the USACE.  A landowner who intends to make substantial investments in acquisition or improvement of land might lawfully proceed with exempt activity, a permit not being required.  The problem is that if the landowner's assumptions were incorrect and the activity later determined not to be exempt, the USACE will issue a cease and desist order.  Obtaining an advanced ruling provides some level of comfort that the activities will have been deemed conducted in good faith.

=====Recapture of exemptions=====

Because some of the six exemptions involved new activities, such as minor drainage and [[silviculture]] (the clearing of forests by the timber industry), Congress recognized the need to impose some limitations on exemptions.  Consequently, Congress placed the so-called recapture clause limitation on these new project exemptions.  Under section 404(f)(2), such new projects would be deprived of their exemption if all of the following three characteristics could be shown:

# A discharge of dredge or fill material in the navigable waters of the United States;
# The discharge is incidental to an activity having as its purpose the bringing of an area of navigable waters into a use to which it was not previously subject, and
# Where the flow or circulation of navigable waters may be impaired or the reach of such waters may be reduced.
To remove the exemption, all of these requirements must be fulfilled—the discharge, the project purpose of bringing an area into a use to which it was not previously subject, and the impairment or reduction of navigable waters.

==== Dredge and fill permits (wetlands, lakes, streams, rivers, and other waters of the U.S.) ====
Under sections 301 and 502 of the Clean Water Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|33|1311}}, {{USC|33|1362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; any discharge of dredged or fill materials into "waters of the United States," including wetlands, is forbidden unless authorized by a permit issued by the USACE pursuant to section 404.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|33|1344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, all discharges of fill or dredged material affecting the bottom elevation of a jurisdictional water of the U.S. require a Department of the Army (DA) permit from USACE.  These permits are an essential part of protecting streams and wetlands, which are often filled by [[Real-estate developer|land developers]]. Wetlands are vital to the ecosystem in filtering streams and rivers and providing habitat for wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2004). [https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=100048AJ.txt "Wetland Regulatory Authority."] Wetland Fact Sheet Series. Document No. EPA-843-F-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mountaintop removal mining]] requires a section 404 permit when soil and rock from the mining operation is placed in streams and wetlands (commonly called a "valley fill"). Pollutant discharges from valley fills to streams also requires an NPDES permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/sc-mining/what-epa-doing-reduce-adverse-impacts-surface-coal-mining-appalachia#cwa |title=What EPA is Doing to Reduce the Adverse Impacts of Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia: Regulating under the Clean Water Act |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=EPA |date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of wetlands permits: general permits and individual permits. General permits change periodically and cover broad categories of activities, and require the permittee to comply with all stated conditions. General permits (such as the Nationwide Permits) are issued for fill activities that will result in minimal adverse effects to the environment. Individual permits are utilized for actions that are not addressed by a general permit, or that do not meet the conditions of a General Permit. In addition, individual permits typically require more analysis than do the general permits, and usually require much more time to prepare the application and to process the permit.

When the USACE processes an application for an Individual Permit, it must publish/issue a public notice describing the proposed action described in the permit application. Although the Corps District Engineer makes the decision to grant a permit, the USEPA Administrator may veto a permit if it is not reasonable. Before making such a decision, however, USEPA must consult with the USACE. A DA permit typically expires after five years.

==== POTW Biosolids Management Program ====
The 1987 WQA created a program for management of [[biosolids]] (sludge) generated by POTWs.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 405, {{USC|33|1345}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of sewage sludge or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for sewage sludge, including disposal; (2) Specify factors to be taken into account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal. EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage sludge management, focusing on sewage sludge generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage sludge regulatory and management programs.&lt;ref name="sludge"&gt;{{cite web|last=EPA|title=Standards for the Use or Disposal of Sewage Sludge; Final Rules | date=1993-02-19 |website=Federal Register |url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/wastetech/biosolids/upload/fr2-19-93.pdf}} {{USFedReg|58|9248}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biosolids'' is used to differentiate treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 ''Beneficial Reuse Policy'' and the 1991 ''Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge,'' with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.&lt;ref name="sludge"/&gt;

The quality of sewage sludge is controlled under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants and those that do not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.&lt;ref name="sludge"/&gt;

Standards are set for sewage sludge generated or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs are referred to as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.&lt;ref name="sludge"/&gt;

=== Title V - General Provisions ===

==== Citizen suits ====
Any U.S. citizen may file a [[citizen suit]] against any person who has allegedly violated an effluent limitation regulation or against the EPA Administrator if the EPA Administrator failed to perform any non-discretionary act or duty required by the CWA.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 505, {{USC|33|1365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Employee protection ====
The CWA includes an employee ("[[whistleblower]]") protection provision.  Employees in the U.S. who believe they were fired or suffered adverse action related to enforcement of the CWA may file a written complaint with the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;CWA 507, {{USC|33|1367}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title VI - State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds ===
The [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]] (CWSRF) program was authorized by the 1987 WQA.&lt;ref&gt;CWA 601, {{USC|33|1381}} ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the municipal construction grants program, which was authorized in the 1972 law under Title II. In the CWSRF, federal funds are provided to the states and Puerto Rico to capitalize their respective revolving funds, which are used to provide financial assistance (loans or grants) to local governments for wastewater treatment, nonpoint source pollution control and estuary protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf/learn-about-clean-water-state-revolving-fund-cwsrf |title=Learn About the Clean Water State Revolving Fund |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-03-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fund provides loans to municipalities at lower-than-market rates. The average interest rate was 1.4 percent nationwide in 2017, compared to an average market rate of 3.5 percent. In 2017, CWSRF assistance totaling $7.4 billion was provided to 1,484 local projects across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=March 2018 |title=Clean Water State Revolving Fund: 2017 Annual Report |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf/clean-water-state-revolving-fund-cwsrf-reports |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 830-R-17-007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier legislation ==
During the 1880s and 1890s, Congress directed USACE to prevent dumping and filling in the nation's harbors, and the program was vigorously enforced.&lt;ref name="CoEEnv"&gt;United States Army Corps of Engineers, Washington, DC. [http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/BriefHistoryoftheCorps/EnvironmentalActivities.aspx "Environmental Activities."] ''Brief History of the Corps.'' Accessed 2013-10-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress first addressed water pollution issues in the [[Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899]],&lt;ref&gt;Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, Ch. 425, Sec. 9, 30 Stat. 1151. {{USC|33|401}}. March 3, 1899&lt;/ref&gt; giving the Corps the authority to regulate most kinds of obstructions to navigation, including hazards resulting from effluents. Portions of this law remain in effect, including Section 13, the so-called [[Refuse Act]].  In 1910, USACE used the act to object to a proposed sewer in [[New York City]], but a court ruled that pollution control was a matter left to the states alone. Speaking to the 1911 National Rivers and Harbors Congress, the chief of the Corps, Brigadier General William H. Bixby, suggested that modern treatment facilities and prohibitions on dumping "should either be made compulsory or at least encouraged everywhere in the United States."&lt;ref name="CoEEnv"/&gt;

Some sections of the 1899 act have been superseded by various amendments, including the 1972 CWA, while other notable legislative predecessors include:
* ''Public Health Service Act of 1912'' expanded the mission of the [[United States Public Health Service]] to study problems of sanitation, sewage and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usstat|37|309}}, August 14, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Oil Pollution Act of 1924'' prohibited the intentional discharge of fuel oil into tidal waters&lt;ref&gt;43 Stat. 604.&lt;/ref&gt; and provided authorization for USACE to apprehend violators. This was repealed by the 1972 CWA, reducing the Corps' role in pollution control to the discharge of dredged or fill material.&lt;ref name="CoEEnv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|68|238|43|604|1924|06|07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Federal Water Pollution Control Act'' of 1948 created a comprehensive set of water quality programs that also provided some financing for state and local governments. Enforcement was limited to interstate waters. The Public Health Service provided financial and technical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|80|845|62|1155|1948|06|30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Water Quality Act of 1965'' required states to issue water quality standards for interstate waters, and authorized the newly created Federal Water Pollution Control Administration to set standards where states failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|89|234|79|903|1965|10|02}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When EPA first opened its doors in 1970, the agency had weak authority to protect U.S. waters, lacking the legal power to write effluent guidelines and possessing only general authority to require secondary treatment from industrial dischargers.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=1 Transcript] (see p1).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clean Water Act and environmental justice ==
[[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12898 (1994) states “... each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority, low-income, and indigenous populations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/EXO12898|title=Executive Order 12898 - HUD|website=portal.hud.gov|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order is also intended to advocate nondiscrimination in federal programs that influence the environment and public health, and aims to provide low-income, minority, and indigenous communities access to public information and participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12898-federal-actions-address-environmental-justice|title=Summary of Executive Order 12898 - Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations |last=EPA, OA, OP, ORPM, RMD |first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, during rock removal operations, a backhoe operator accidentally struck a petroleum pipeline near the railroad tracks. The operator’s mistake caused the pipeline to rupture and spill between 1,000 and 5,000 gallons of heating oil into the Skagway river. Despite not being present at the scene during operations [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] Roadmaster [[Edward Hanousek, Jr.]] and President Paul Taylor were both held responsible for the spill and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court. {{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/99-323.ZD.html|title=Edward Hanousek, Jr v.

The Court rejected the position of the USACE that its authority over water was essentially limitless. Though the case resulted in no binding [[case law]], the Court suggested a narrowing of federal jurisdiction and implied the federal government needed a more substantial link between navigable federal waters and wetlands than it had been using, but held onto the "significant nexus" test.&lt;ref name="Rapanos"&gt;U.S. Supreme Court.

== Recent developments ==
=== Waters of the United States ===
In May 2015 EPA released a new [[Clean Water Rule|rule]] on the definition of "waters of the United States" ("WOTUS") and the future enforcement of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shepherd |first=Katie |date=2015-05-27 |title=Under new EPA rule, Clean Water Act protections will cover all active tributaries |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-epa-clean-water-act-20150527-story.html |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and EPA (2015-06-29). "Clean Water Rule: Definition of “Waters of the United States.” ''Federal Register,'' {{Federal Register|80|37054}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen states sued, and on August 27 U.S. Chief District Judge for North Dakota [[Ralph R.

On February 28, 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] signed documents directing EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review and rewrite the Obama administration's "[[Clean Water Rule]]," which would clarify the WOTUS definition. The agencies were ordered to reassess the rule consistent with promoting economic growth and minimizing regulatory uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/us/politics/trump-epa-clean-water-climate-change.html |title=Trump Plans to Begin E.P.A.

The Sixth Circuit appeals court stay was overturned on January 22, 2018 when the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled unanimously that challenges to the 2015 rule must be filed in [[United States district courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hklaw.com/publications/Supreme-Court-Makes-Jurisdictional-Determination-on-Clean-Water-Act-Rule-02-02-2018/ |title=Supreme Court Makes Jurisdictional Determination on Clean Water Act Rule |last1=Petersen |first1=Rafe |last2=Heishman |first2=Aaron S. |date=2018-02-02 |publisher=Holland &amp; Knight LLP |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA then formally suspended the 2015 regulation and announced plans to issue a new version later in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davenport |first=Coral |date=2018-01-31 |title=E.P.A.

== Effects ==
{{also|Water pollution in the United States}}
To date, the water quality goals stated by Congress in the 1972 act have not been achieved by American society:
* "to make all U.S. waters fishable and swimmable by 1983;"
* "to have zero water pollution discharge by 1985;"
* "to prohibit discharge of toxic amounts of toxic pollutants".&lt;ref name="Keiser"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Keiser |first=David A. |last2=Shapiro |first2=Joseph S.|date=January 2017 |title=Consequences of the Clean Water Act and the Demand for Water Quality |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23070 |doi=10.3386/w23070 |url=http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/card_workingpapers/592 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}
More than half of U.S. stream and river miles continue to violate water quality standards. Surveys of lakes, ponds and reservoirs indicated that about 70 percent were impaired (measured on a surface area basis), and a little more than 70 percent of the nation’s coastlines, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ofmpub.epa.gov/waters10/attains_nation_cy.control |title=National Summary of State Information |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=Water Quality Assessment and TMDL Information |publisher=EPA |access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the impairment vary by location; major sources are agriculture, industry and communities (typically through urban runoff). Some of these pollution sources are difficult to control through national regulatory programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vig |first1=Norman J. |last2=Kraft |first2=Michael E. |date=2017 |title=Environmental Policy: New Directions for the Twenty-First Century |edition=10th |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=CQ Press |page= |isbn=9781506383446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the passage of the 1972 act, the levels of pollution in the United States have experienced a dramatic decrease. The law has resulted in much cleaner waterways than before the bill was passed. Agriculture, industry, communities and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide, and many of these waters are drinking water sources. In many watersheds [[nutrient pollution]] (excess nitrogen and phosphorus) has become a major problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient Pollution: The Problem |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/problem |date=2017-03-10 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued in a 2008 paper that the Clean Water Act has made extremely positive contributions to the environment, but is in desperate need of reform to address the pollution problems that remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Andreen |first1=William L. |last2=Jones |first2=Shana C. |date=July 2008 |title=The Clean Water Act: A Blueprint For Reform |url=http://progressivereform.org/articles/CW_Blueprint_802.pdf |publisher=Center for Progressive Reform |location=Edgewater, MD |id=CPR White Paper #802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 economic study finds that "most types of water pollution declined [over the period 1962-2001], though the rate of decrease slowed over time... Our finding of decreases in most pollutants implies that the prevalence of such violations was even greater before the Clean Water Act." Several studies have estimated that the costs of the CWA (including the expenditures for the Title II construction grants program) are higher than the benefits. An EPA study had similar findings, but acknowledged that several kinds of benefits were unmeasured.&lt;ref name="Keiser" /&gt;{{rp|2}} (''See'' [[Cost–benefit analysis]].)

{{Evidence law}}
'''Demonstrative evidence''' is evidence in the form of a [[Depiction|representation]] of an object.  This is, as opposed to, [[real evidence]], [[testimony]], or other forms of [[evidence]] used at [[trial]].

==Examples==
Examples of demonstrative evidence include [[Photography|photos]], [[x-rays]], [[Videography|videotapes]], [[movies]], [[sound recordings]], diagrams, [[forensic animation]], [[map]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[graphics|graphs]], [[animation]], [[simulations]], and models.  It is useful for assisting a [[finder of fact]] (fact-finder) in establishing context among the facts presented in a case.  To be admissible, a demonstrative exhibit must “fairly and accurately” represent the real object at the relevant time. See [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] 901, 902, and 1001-1004 for an example from United States law.

Other examples of demonstrative evidence include case specific medical exhibits, colorized diagnostic films, general anatomy and surgery exhibits.  These forms of demonstrative evidence are commonly used as a personal injury lawyer resource.  Demonstrative evidence with dramatic impact can maximize the value of a case by effectively depicting catastrophic/traumatic injuries, complex surgical procedures, surgical mistakes or summarize injuries suffered by an individual.  These examples of demonstrative evidence are used for settlement conferences, arbitration, mediation, medical expert depositions and trial presentations.

Demonstrative evidence is an effective aid in infringement litigation.

Whether prosecuting an infringer or defending a patent, originally filled patent drawings which are a part of most patent applications, can play an imperative part in any upcoming litigation.
If the original patent drawings are not complete, accurate and exact, then the resulting output for litigation graphics is unreliable and could even hurt a case.  

There are many ways to convert patent drawings into effective litigation graphics.
Here are a few ways:

A patent drawing can be made visually transparent and overplayed onto an opposing image to show likeness or differences.  

Color can be applied to elements of the original patent drawings and the same colors on similar elements of an opposing images to highlight likeness.

A front view from the application can be placed alongside a front view of the opposing invention with additions outlined in color to emphasize differences

A process flow chart from a utility patent application can be used alongside a flow chart of the opposing party with an insert between the two to indicate differences or similarities in process.

Callout information on a patent drawing can clarify key elements of the invention and emphasize important features.

Drawings from a patent application can be used in PowerPoint to create a simple tutorial using animation with color arrows, overlays and voice over to explain an invention.

Original patent drawings can be used as a basis to create complex 3D animations.  Operation, technical procedures, incompatibilities between inventions and moving parts of an invention can be clearly presented. Furthermore, animations can indicate time, motion or speed, compare alternative theories or simplify highly complex data.

There are endless ways to manipulate original patent drawings to make compelling litigation graphics, each circumstance unique based on the setting, the invention, the desired outcome and budget. 

Using original patent drawings as a starting point can save cost of having to start from scratch. 

In many patent lawsuits filed, a substantial amount is spent on demonstrative evidence. 
WIPO Magazine stated, “according to a recent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers over 5,000 patent lawsuits – an all-time record – were filed, each costing on average around US$2.8 million.”  Those numbers are for 2012; it is unlikely that costs have come down. 

See the following link for WIPO article “What Place for Patent Drawings”
[http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2014/03/article_0005.html IP Litigation: What Place for Patent Drawings?]

==History==
Before photographs and other demonstrative evidence, [[lawyer]]s relied on purely testimonial or substantive evidence.  [[Melvin Belli]] and [[Earl Rogers]] helped change that by introducing more demonstrative evidence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Scientific evidence emerged in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

==Mechanics of use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2008}}
In American [[jurisprudence]], demonstrative evidence, like any other kind of [[evidence]] must be [[wikt:relevant|relevant]].  At this point the proponent of the demonstrative evidence can either try to get the evidence admitted into the official record of the case or can choose to use the evidence as merely a prop.  If the proponent of the evidence wants to have the evidence included in the official record of the case, the proponent will first ask for the evidence to be marked by the court for identification purposes.  After the evidence is marked for identification, the proponent of the demonstrative evidence must [[lay a foundation]].  It is at this time that the relevancy of the demonstrative evidence is usually challenged.  Laying of a foundation explains how the demonstrative evidence relates to the facts of the case and establishes the evidence's authenticity.  Once the foundation is laid, the proponent may ask to officially move the piece of evidence into the record where it is marked as a full exhibit.  If the evidence is marked as a full exhibit the jury may refer to the evidence during deliberations and in most jurisdictions the jury may examine the evidence during deliberations.  If the evidence is not marked as a full exhibit, the jury cannot do these things.  As a matter of courtesy, the proponent of the demonstrative evidence generally shows the piece of evidence to the opposing party before marking it for identification purposes.  In criminal cases certain kinds of demonstrative evidence are subject to mandatory disclosure under the case law governing [[Discovery (law)|discovery]].  See [[Brady v. Maryland]].

==Popular culture==
Examples of demonstrative evidence from popular culture include their use in these motion pictures:

* ''[[The Rainmaker (1997 film)|The Rainmaker]]'' - use of a plaque to show the number of claims filed and accepted
* ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'' - charts and files
* ''[[A Few Good Men (film)|A Few Good Men]]'' - logs and photographs
* ''[[My Cousin Vinny]]'' - photographs, tape measure

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2135">A '''duvet day''' is a formal allowance of time off given by some employers, most commonly in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/e-cyclopedia/1099138.stm |title=E-CYCLOPEDIA &amp;#124; Duvet days: A snooze button for life |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-01-03 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordspy"&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul McFedries |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/duvetday.asp |title=duvet day |publisher=Word Spy |date=2001-06-25 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from holiday allowance in that no prior notice is needed. Employees receive an allocation of days where if they do not want to go to work for any reason they can use a duvet day. The name is a reference to [[duvet|the item of bedding]].

Duvet days were originally given to employees by UK company August One Communications in 1997,&lt;ref name="wordspy"/&gt; and the idea has grown in popularity as some companies aim to address the changing work-life climate where people work longer hours. It can be stipulated formally in a [[contract of employment]] and is considered part of the remunerations package along with [[holiday]] allowance. The term has also since become used by people to reference taking a day off work for no normally accepted reason (such as mild sickness, grievance or holiday) even if they have no official duvet day entitlement with their employer.

In the Indian subcontinent, this is historically called a '''casual leave'''.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Employees usually are sanctioned a fixed number of days off (usually 12 per year for government and 8-12 for private employees). These days can be taken with or without planning. Since these leave days could not be accumulated or carried over into the next year, they would expire at the year end. This created a tendency to utilize all the left over casual leave in November and December. The Indian casual leave has been around for more than 50 years.

The '''export of cryptography''' is the transfer from one country to another of devices and technology related to [[cryptography]].

&lt;!--Note: Copied from [[Export of cryptography from the United States]]--&gt;
In the early days of the [[Cold War]], the United States and its allies developed an elaborate series of export control regulations designed to prevent a wide range of Western technology from falling into the hands of others, particularly the [[Eastern bloc]]. All export of technology classed as 'critical' required a license. [[CoCom]] was  organized to coordinate Western export controls.

Currently, many countries, notably those participating in the [[Wassenaar Arrangement]], have similar restrictions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

[[Image:Iván el Terrible y su hijo, por Iliá Repin.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Ivan the Terrible]] and his son [[Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia|Ivan]] on 16 November  1581'':  a painting of the filicide by [[Ilya Yefimovich Repin]]]]
{{homicide}}

'''Filicide''' is the deliberate act of a [[parent]] [[Child murder|killing their own child]]. The word ''filicide'' derives from the [[Latin]] words ''filius'' meaning "son" or ''filia'' meaning daughter, and the suffix ''-cide'' meaning to kill, murder, or cause death. 

"Filicide" may refer both to the parent who killed his or her child, as well as to the criminal act that the parent committed.

==History==
A 1999 [[United States Department of Justice]] study concluded that between 1976 and 1997 in the United States, mothers were responsible for a higher share of children killed during [[infancy]], while fathers were more likely to have been responsible for the murders of children aged eight or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/wo.pdf |title=Women Offenders |accessdate= 2018-05-29 |author1=Greenfeld, Lawrence A. |author2=Snell, Tracy L. |date=2000-03-10 |work=NCJ 175688 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100603113816/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/wo.pdf |archivedate= 2010-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, 52% of the children killed by their mothers ('''maternal filicide''') were male, while 57% of the children killed by their fathers ('''paternal filicide''') were male.  Parents were responsible for 61% of child murders under the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedman | first1 = S. H. | last2 = Horwitz | first2 = S. M. | last3 = Resnick | first3 = P. J. | year = 2005 | title = Child murder by mothers: A critical analysis of the current state of knowledge and a research agenda | journal = [[Am J Psychiatry]] | volume = 162 | issue = | pages = 1578–1587 | pmid=16135615 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.9.1578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{verify credibility|date=April 2013}}discussed in section Friedman source of the talk page, tag put inside comments on May 2014--&gt; 
Sometimes, there is a [[Murder–suicide|combination of murder and suicide]] in filicide cases. On average, according to [[FBI]] statistics, 450 children are murdered by their parents each year in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/10/parents-kill-children-fbi-data/15280259/ USA Today. Parents who do the unthinkable -- kill their children]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of filicide ==
Dr. Phillip Resnick, who published research on filicide in 1969, stated that there were five main motives for filicide, including "altruistic," "fatal maltreatment," "unwanted child," and "spousal revenge."&lt;ref name=CTV&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/spousal-revenge-rare-motive-for-killing-kids-experts-say-1.575187|title=Spousal revenge rare motive for killing kids, experts say|publisher=''[[CTV News]]''|date=2010-11-16|accessdate=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruistic killings occur because the parent believes the world is too cruel for the child or because the child is enduring suffering (whether this is actually occurring or not). In fatal maltreatment killings, the goal is not always to kill the child but death may occur anyway, and [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]] is in that category. Spousal revenge killings are killings of children done to indirectly harm a domestic partner; they do not frequently occur.&lt;ref name=CTV/&gt; Glen Carruthers, author of "Making sense of spousal revenge filicide," argued that those who engage in spousal revenge killings see their own children as objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carruthers, Glen|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916300556|title=Making sense of spousal revenge filicide|journal=[[Aggression and Violent Behavior]]|date=July–August 2016|volume=29|p=30–35|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2016.05.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children at risk ==
In the United States, homicide is in the top five causes of deaths of children, and in the top three causes of death in children aged between 1 and 4 years old.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A direct [[correlation]] has been identified between [[child abuse]] rates and child homicide rates. Research suggests children who are murdered by their parent(s) were [[physical abuse|physically abused]] victims prior to death. This is often seen as an indicator of [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Murder in America|last = Holmes|first = Ronald M.|publisher = Sage Publications, Inc.|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, California|pages = 116|last2 = Holmes|first2 = Stephen T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4828">In the context of [[negotiation]]s, a '''framework agreement''' is an agreement between two parties that recognizes that the parties have not come to a final agreement on all matters relevant to the relationship between them, but have come to agreement on enough matters to [[progression (disambiguation) | move forward]] with the relationship, with further details to be agreed to in the future.

In the context of [[procurement]], a framework agreement is an agreement between one or more businesses or organisations, "the purpose of which is to establish the terms governing contracts to be awarded during a given period, in particular with regard to price and, where appropriate, the quantity envisaged".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/pdfs/uksi_20150102_en.pdf Public Contract Regulations 2015], Regulation 33(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==International framework agreements==
[[Image:George Mitchell in Tel Aviv July 26, 2009.jpg|thumb|Senator George Mitchell in Tel Aviv, 26 July 2009]]
In [[international law]], such an agreement between countries or groups can acknowledge that they cannot reach full agreement on all issues, but are willing to memorialize a structure by which some disagreements can be resolved.&lt;ref name="Rosenne"&gt;Shabtai Rosenne, “The Framework Agreement as the Basis for the Jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and Some Problems of Language”, in S. Rosenne, Essays on International Law and Practice (2007), pp. 161–170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the effort to reach an agreement between [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], Senator [[George J. Mitchell]] explained:

{{quote|A framework agreement is not an interim agreement. It's more detailed than a [[declaration of principles]], but is less than a full-fledged [[treaty]]. Its purpose is to establish the fundamental compromises necessary to enable the parties to then flesh out and complete a comprehensive agreement that will end the conflict and establish a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Mitchell]], quoted in [[Elliott Abrams]], "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090305101.html Three mistakes the U.S. must not make in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks], ''[[Washington Post]]'' (September 4, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Entering into a framework agreement can shift the lawmaking power from the states to a plenary body, and can shift the basis for forming consent to new norms and standards reached through their negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Brunnée, "Reweaving the Fabric of International Law?: Patterns of Consent in Environmental Framework Agreements", in Rüdiger Wolfrum and Volker Röben (eds), ''Developments of International Law in Treaty Making'' (2005), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of entering into framework agreements originated in the 1950s with an agreement regarding asylum between [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="Rosenne"/&gt;

A number of international accords are characterized as framework agreements:

*[[Agreed Framework]], between North Korea and the United States
*[[Baker Plan]], a United Nations initiative to grant self-determination to Western Sahara
*[[Banana Framework Agreement]], between the European Union and banana-producing countries
*[[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation#BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement]], involving the Bay of Bengal
*[[Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement]], between mainland China and Taiwan
*[[General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] or Dayton Agreement
*[[Iran nuclear deal framework]]
*[[Strategic Framework Agreement]] (SFA), between the United States and Iraq (2008)
*[[Trade and Investment Framework Agreement]], an international trade pact

==Domestic framework agreements==
Non-international framework agreements include:
* [[Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro]], a preliminary peace agreement between the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the government of the Philippines calling for the creation of an autonomous area, Bangsamoro
* [[Social Union Framework Agreement]], in Canada

==Procurement==
{{Main article|Government procurement in the European Union}}
Public contracting authorities may enter into framework agreements with one or more businesses, which prescribe the terms and conditions which would apply to any subsequent contract and make provision for selection and appointment of a contractor by reference directly to the agreed terms and conditions or by holding a competition inviting only the partners to the framework agreement to submit specific commercial proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/plan/contracts/index_en.htm|title=Framework contracts|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Standards Board for Alternative Investments''' ('''SBAI'''), formerly known as the '''Hedge Fund Standards Board''', is an international [[Standards organization|standard-setting body]] for the [[alternative investment]] industry and sets the voluntary standard of best practices and practices endorsed by its members. Its primary role is to be the custodian of the Alternative Investment Standards (formerly known as "the Standards"), which are designed to create a "framework of transparency, integrity and good governance" in the way the hedge fund industry operates.&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ar16"&gt;{{cite book|title=HFSB Annual Report|date=2016|publisher=Standards Board for Alternative Investments|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
== History ==
The SBAI originated in June 2007, when a group of leading [[alternative investment]] managers formed the Hedge Fund Working Group to develop industry standards in areas such as disclosure, valuation, risk management, governance, and shareholder conduct..&lt;ref name="HFSB001"/&gt; Founding firms included [[Marshall Wace]], [[Cheyne Capital Management]], [[Man Group]], and [[CQS (Asset Manager)|CQS]].&lt;ref name="ar16"/&gt; In January 2008, the working group was established as a nonprofit, called the Hedge Fund Standards Board (HFSB). Its primary purpose was to oversee what's called the "Standards" (now known as the "Alternative Investment Standards"). At its inception, the board had 14 leading hedge fund managers and was chaired by Sir [[Andrew Large]] to develop the standards.&lt;ref name="large"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Andrew Large: Advisor to the Board|url=http://www.sbai.org/2016/05/13/sir-andrew-large-advisor-to-the-board/|website=SBAI|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016 it had almost 200 hedge fund managers and [[institutional investors]] as members; the total assets under management of all members was $3 trillion.&lt;ref name="HFSB002"/&gt; In 2014, the board became an affiliate member of the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) and in 2016 established mutual observer relationship with the [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]].&lt;ref name="HFSB003"/&gt;

On July 2011, Dame [[Amelia Fawcett]] was appointed Chair of the SBAI, replacing Andrew Large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dame Amelia Fawcett DBE|url=http://www.sbai.org/2016/05/12/dame-amelia-fawcett-dbe/|website=SBAI|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, SBAI becomes an affiliate member of [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) and in 2016 SBAI and [[International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds]] (IFSWF) agreed to engage in mutual observership.&lt;ref name="feb18"&gt;{{cite book|title=Standards Board for Alternative Investments (SBAI)|date=February 2018|publisher=SBAI|location=London|url=http://www.sbai.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/SBAI-General-Presentation.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017 it announced that it was changing its name from HFSB to the SBAI or Standards Board for Alternative Investments (SBAI) to "reflect the evolution of the industry". Specifically, it noted that "managers increasingly offer their investment strategies through a variety of vehicles beyond '[[hedge funds]]', including [[liquid alternatives]], regulated funds, [[Equity co-investment|co-investment vehicles]], drawdown funds, and [[managed accounts]]" while at the same time moving away from "hedge fund" as a term in order to "classify and integrate a diverse array of alternatives strategies by underlying asset class, return profile, market exposure, or liquidity".&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hedge Funds Standards Board (HFSB) Becomes Standards Board for Alternative Investments (SBAI)|url=http://www.sbai.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/HFSB-Press-Release-13-September-2017.pdf|accessdate=9 February 2018|work=Standards Board for Alternative Investments|date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''INTO University Partnerships''' is a British limited-liability partnership that specializes in setting up [[joint venture]]s with universities.  It focuses on the provision of [[foundation course]]s for [[international student]]s, including [[English language learning and teaching|English language]], especially [[English for Academic Purposes]]. So far, INTO operates 22 international study centres within leading university partners in the United Kingdom, North America and China. The centres offer courses that enable students to prepare for university degrees, learn English, or study at postgraduate level. A research report commissioned by NAFSA: Association of International Educators identified INTO University Partnerships as one of the eight third-party providers offerings pathway programs for international students in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2017/05/pathway-research-international-student-recruitment.html|title=NAFSA research on landscape of third-party pathway partnerships in the US|website=www.dreducation.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==History==
INTO University Partnerships was founded in 2005 and is chaired by Andrew Colin, who had previously set up [[Study Group International]], an education business he sold to the [[Daily Mail Group]], and [[Embassy CES]], a chain of [[language school]]s.
Since 2006, INTO has launched 23 joint ventures with a range of universities in the United Kingdom, North America and China. Under the [[joint venture]] model, the university remains responsible for educational quality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careercenter.ru/career/articles/2008/03/011.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012063345/http://www.careercenter.ru/career/articles/2008/03/011.html|date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while INTO provides the marketing infrastructure, finance and specialist management experience. This [[business model]] was developed in a political climate that favours [[public-private partnership]]s. [[Bill Rammell]], [[Minister of State]] in the [[Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills]], in response to a question from [[Colchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Colchester MP]] [[Bob Russell (UK politician)|Bob Russell]], welcomed such innovation in [[higher education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080707/text/80707w0053.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 07 July 2008  (pt 0053)|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, INTO opened a £35 million six-storey building at INTO UEA, with 415 en-suite study-bedrooms and classroom space for 600 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.edp24.co.uk/search/story.aspx?brand=EDPOnline&amp;category=News&amp;itemid=NOED19%20Mar%202008%2008:03:57:930&amp;tBrand=EDPOnline&amp;tCategory=search]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; New buildings also opened in Exeter in 2011 and Newcastle in September 2012. INTO Newcastle University, built at a cost of £74million, was launched alongside on-campus student accommodation, the first in the university's history. In early 2013, INTO University Partnerships announced an equity investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.into-corporate.com/news-and-views/news/2013/01/into-announces-major-investment-by-leading-us-equity-firm.aspx | work=INTO Corporate website | title=INTO announces major investment by leading US equity firm | date=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Leeds Equity Partners of £66m in the group for a 25 percent stake in the business. This investment completed the first stage of INTO’s funding plans, which are aimed at providing universities with access to significant external capital to fund innovation and capacity building in the higher education sector. Two years later, INTO's first partnership with the University of East Anglia, INTO University of East Anglia won a Queen's Award for Enterprise (International Trade) &lt;ref&gt;http://into-corporate.com/news-and-views/news/2016/04/into-university-of-east-anglia-receives-queen%E2%80%99s-award-for-enterprise.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2016. INTO also formed a new partnership with Washington State University in the same year.

==Global recruitment==
Through five greater regional directorates, INTO employs over 100 full-time, market-based staff in 31 offices across 17 countries and invests £4 million each year in training, monitoring and performance-managing its counseling organizations. Every year, INTO helps almost 14,000 students from 120 countries and territories achieve their dream of studying overseas. In 2011, INTO conducted more than 300 training sessions with 600 organisations, including large-scale familiarisation trips to launch new partnerships. All recruitment activity is planned centrally, but coordinated through university-based joint venture groups.

==Awards==
* 2011 - Education Investor Awards: Exporting Excellence Award (for its contribution to international education)

==Organisational development==
In INTO's first three years, the company created 435 new jobs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} They currently have around 1,800 members of staff across the group who speak over 20 languages.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Future plans==
In their submission to the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] on student visas in 2011, INTO said it had "welcomed and educated almost 21,000 students from more than 138 countries and territories to the UK and provide direct employment for close to 1,350 people in the UK alone".&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmhaff/773/773vw23.htm Written evidence submitted by INTO University Partnerships (SV27)] [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] - Additional Written Evidence, Student visas, 15 March 2011, accessed 5 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Commencements at INTO study centres have now surpassed 41,000 with an average of 90% student satisfaction.

INTO has been in preliminary discussion with several other British universities, the majority of which have decided not to form a partnership, including [[University of Essex|Essex]], [[Goldsmiths College|Goldsmiths]] and [[University of Westminster|Westminster]]. Essex elected to restructure its own international operations, and Goldsmiths to suspend its internationalisation plans.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jul/30/foreign.students | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Anthea | last=Lipsett | title=Language trainer Into threatens to sue university union | date=30 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the Senate of [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University in Belfast]], Northern Ireland, voted in favour of an INTO partnership in April 2009, which led to the setting-up of [[INTO Queen's University of Belfast]].

In July 2008, INTO announced that it had signed its first agreement in the [[United States]], to operate a foundation year programme for [[Oregon State University]]. OSU said that it had long wanted to expand the number of international students, and turned to INTO for its worldwide infrastructure and expertise in recruitment; some staff, on the other hand, expressed concerns over working conditions. The programme was due to start in autumn 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/education/08kaplan.html | work=The New York Times | first=Tamar | last=Lewin | title=College and Company Link Up to Lure Foreigners | date=8 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 150–200 students.  A local news source, OregonLive, stated that the new venture would "replace the English Language Institute, a self-sustaining program that has helped international students learn English for 43 years," a move that filled its former director with concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/education/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/news/1218511504125970.xml&amp;coll=7 |title=Oregon State University and a British company court international students - and controversy |publisher=OregonLive.com |date=2008-08-12 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Provost of OSU, Sabah Randhawa, who has led the university's transformational development, expressed satisfaction with the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nafsa.org/publication.sec/international_educator_1|title=NAFSA: Association of International Educators|publisher=Nafsa.org|accessdate=19 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208073934/http://www.nafsa.org/publication.sec/international_educator_1|archivedate=8 December 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017|April}}, INTO has established partnerships with 23 universities across the UK, North America and China and plans to increase its network to 30 partnerships by 2020.

In May 2018, it was reported that owner and founder Andrew Colin is seeking a buyer for his INTO University Partnerships.  He is seeking to sell INTO for $400.1 million USD, and has hired Deutche Bank to look at strategic options after receiving a number of takeover approaches.  Andrew Colin is the majority shareholder of INTO, with the remainder in the hands of senior staff and Leeds Equity Partners (25% stake). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/education-tycoon-andrew-colin-lines-up-300m-payday-from-sale-of-his-company-into-university-partnerships-t7vzzcm8f|title=Education tycoon Andrew Colin lines up £300m payday from sale of his company INTO University Partnerships|last=Harrington|first=Ben|date=2018-05-06|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en|issn=0956-1382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition from lecturers and conflict with UCU==
Several British universities have been approached by INTO and some have decided not to proceed. For example, in a survey of staff at Essex, 90% rejected the proposed partnership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=3377 90% of Essex University staff oppose privatisation plan press release] [[University and College Union]] 20 June 2008, accessed 5 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This objection is compounded by two things: that INTO does not recognise unions, and that Andrew Colin acknowledges that the rates offered are likely to be worse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.co.uk/opinion-formers/press-releases/ucu-90-of-essex-university-staff-oppose-privatisation-plan-$1228183$364410.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201234114/http://www.politics.co.uk/opinion-formers/press-releases/ucu-90-of-essex-university-staff-oppose-privatisation-plan-%241228183%24364410.htm|date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Centre for English Language Studies (ICELS) at [[Oxford Brookes University]] strongly opposed INTO's approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handsofficels.org.uk/ |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820203020/http://www.handsofficels.org.uk/ |archivedate=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University and College Union]] claimed credit for this opposition influencing the university's decision. The university stated that it would not go ahead with the project because it required such a large real estate commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/administration/story/0,,2046653,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Debbie | last=Andalo | title=University drops English privatisation plans | date=30 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of Essex]], following questions from UCU,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucu.essex.ac.uk/into/2008-03-11-council-briefing.pdf]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained the benefits of working with INTO,&lt;ref name="essex1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/into_proposal/ |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307060317/http://www.essex.ac.uk/into_proposal/ |archivedate=March 7, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in October 2008 decided not to enter a partnership.&lt;ref name="essex1"/&gt;

In February 2007, the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' published an article featuring the UCU's dispute of guarantees that INTO offered to existing Newcastle staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=207783&amp;sectioncode=26 “Hive-off row”] ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]''  9 Feb 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Colin rejected the UCU criticism, saying in 2007, "Give me three years and I will show you it is possible to create secure, well-paid jobs in EAP, and more of them," and rejected the similarity of his business model to [[private finance initiative]]s (PFI).&lt;ref&gt;''English Language Gazette'' "Profiteer or prophet?" interview by Melanie Butler, August 2007, available from the media page.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Colin said of the lecturers' union in 2008, "I've asked for a dialogue with the UCU, but they won't talk to us. The union causes a lot of anxiety and talk about standards and job losses, they don't mention the fact that we are creating jobs and that the university is responsible for academic standards."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=401674&amp;sectioncode=26 "Into founder says his private capital supports public work."] "[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]" 1 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, INTO threatened UCU with a legal suit for [[defamation]], in response to a union briefing entitled "Into the unknown." The union removed the document from their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jul/30/foreign.students | work = [[The Guardian]] | title = Language trainer Into threatens to sue university union | date = 30 July 2008 | location=London | first=Anthea | last=Lipsett | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==INTO Giving==
Since 2008, INTO Giving has raised more than US $1,000,000 (UK £770,000) for children’s education and teachers in Asia, Africa, the Americas, the Middle East and Europe. Funds are raised through INTO student, faculty and employee fundraising events and donations, and are matched penny for penny by INTO Founder and INTO Giving Trustee Andrew Colin.

INTO Giving has helped thousands of children and their teachers through 30 projects in 20 countries across five continents. The charity’s projects have included building new and refurbishing rundown schools (Cambodia, China, Ghana, Malawi, Zambia, and in Lebanon for Syrian refugee children), psychological counselling services for Syrian refugee children, opening IT centres and libraries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Zambia), providing school meals and classroom supplies (Thailand) and refurbishing teacher accommodation (Ghana).

Since 2016, INTO Giving has prioritized supporting girls’ education and refugee schoolchildren.

INTO Giving is UK registered charity No 1126262, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity in the US and is governed by a Board of Trustees.

==Accounts question==
INTO reached the [[Hansard|parliamentary record]] when MP [[Austin Mitchell]] asked why it had not filed financial records with [[Companies House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080305/text/80305w0041.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 05 Mar 2008  (pt 0041)|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is legally obliged to do. Andrew Colin said in the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' that the delay in submitting accounts was a "simple mistake."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Times Higher Education]]'' [http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=401674 "Into founder says his private capital supports public work"]&lt;/ref&gt; He also revealed that the first set of submitted accounts showed a loss of £1.7m, but stated that the company would be beyond the [[break-even]] point by the third year.

==Aircraft==
According to the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]]'s database on registered civil aircraft, a subsidiary, INTO Air, has, in the past, featured a registered Swiss-built [[Pilatus PC-12]] turbo-prop aircraft, with registration G-INTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&amp;pagetype=65&amp;appid=1&amp;mode=detailnosummary&amp;fullregmark=G-INTO |title=GINFO Database Search &amp;#124; Aircraft Register &amp;#124; Operations and Safety |publisher=Caa.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''General Aviation'' magazine quoted the cost of these aircraft as starting at $4m and states that Andrew Colin ordered a second aircraft for delivery in 2010.
	 	
&lt;ref name="PC-12s gang up at Goodwood"&gt;''General Aviation'' August 2007, p21. [http://www.iaopa-eur.org/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/aug07/p19-21.pdf "PC-12s gang up at Goodwood"]&lt;/ref&gt; Colin credits the first [[Business jet|corporate plane]], which he had had for only a few months at the time of the interview, with transforming the way he and his UK team did business, removing much of the strain of travel. “In one week we attended meetings in Glasgow and Newcastle on the Monday, Oxford and London on the Tuesday, Exeter and Birmingham on the Wednesday, Glasgow again on the Thursday and Norwich on the Friday."&lt;ref name="PC-12s gang up at Goodwood"/&gt; The registration of the plane has since been removed from the CAA database.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="140958">'''Indian termination''' was the policy of the United States from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Getches | first1 = David H. | last2 = Wilkinson | first2 = Charles F. | last3 = Williams | first3 = Robert L. | title = Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law | year = 2005 | publisher = Thomson/West | location = St. Paul, MN  | isbn = 0-314-14422-6 | pages = 199–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shaped by a series of laws and policies with the intent of assimilating [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] into mainstream American society. Assimilation was not new. The belief that indigenous people should abandon their traditional lives and become "civilized" had been the basis of policy for centuries. But what was new was the sense of urgency, that with or without consent, tribes must be terminated and begin to live "as Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metcalf|first1=R. Warren|title=Termination's legacy : the discarded Indians of Utah|date=2002|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0-8032-3201-2|pages=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lvBQBOP3icC&amp;lpg|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end, Congress set about ending the special relationship between tribes and the federal government. The intention was to grant Native Americans all the rights and privileges of citizenship, reduce their dependence on a bureaucracy whose mismanagement had been documented, and eliminate the expense of providing services for native people.&lt;ref name="Wunder (1999)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wunder|first1=John R.|title=Native American Sovereignty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeDnRAUt6b8C&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;dq|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|accessdate=26 December 2014|pages=248–249|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practical terms, the policy ended [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|the U.S. government's recognition of sovereignty of tribes]], trusteeship over [[Indian reservation]]s, and exclusion of state law applicability to native persons.  From the government's perspective Native Americans were to become taxpaying citizens, subject to state and federal taxes as well as laws, from which they had previously been exempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

From the native standpoint, [[Northern Cheyenne]] former [[U.S. Senator]] from Colorado [[Ben Nighthorse Campbell]] said of assimilation and termination in a speech delivered in Montana:

{{quote|If you can't change them, absorb them until they simply disappear into the mainstream culture. ...

&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The policy for termination of tribes collided with the Native American peoples' own desires to preserve native identity, reflected in an activism that increased after [[World War II]] and survived through the anti-collectivism era of [[Joseph McCarthy]]. The termination policy was changed in the 1960s and rising activism resulted in the ensuing decades of restoration of tribal governments and increased [[Native American self-determination]].

== Process ==

Termination began with a series of laws directed at dismantling tribal sovereignty. From June 1940 until September 1950, six laws were passed that gave states criminal or limited-criminal jurisdiction over tribes and reservations within those states. In 1949, the Hoover Commission Report, recommending integration of native peoples into mainstream society, and the 1952 House Report (HR No. 2503), investigating the Bureau of Indian Affairs, both portrayed termination as cost effective and  benign in its effects.&lt;ref name="Valandra (2006)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TIJ4AAWupSgC&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;ots=N0VPxo_-rW&amp;dq=six%20nations%2C%20termination%20policy&amp;pg|title= Not Without Our Consent: Lakota Resistance to Termination, 1950-59 |first=Edward Charles |last=Valandra |publisher=University of Illinois Press |date=2006| page = 35 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[House concurrent resolution 108]] of 1953 announced the federal policy of termination and called for the immediate ending of the Federal relationship with a selected group of tribes.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"&gt;Wilkinson, Charles. ''Blood Struggle: The Rise of Modern Indian Nations''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2005 &lt;!--provide page numbers--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The resolution established that Congress would pass termination acts on a tribe by tribe basis.  Most such acts included the cessation of federal recognition and all the federal aid that came along with that designation. Between 1953 and 1964, the government terminated recognition of more than 100 tribes and bands as sovereign dependent nations.  These actions affected more than 12,000 Native Americans or 3% of the total Native American population.  Approximately {{convert|2500000|acre|km2}} of trust land was removed from protected status during these years.  Much was sold by individuals to non-Natives.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, David E., ''American Indian Politics and the American Political System'', 2nd Edition (Rowman and Littlefield, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-7425-5346-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The termination of these tribes ended federal government guardianship of and recognition of those tribal governments and US jurisdiction of tribal lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrcprograms.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cin_hist_terminationpolicy|title=Council of Indian Nations reaches out to Native American communities that lack medical facilities, stores, electricity, and water. - Council of Indian Nations|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015243/http://www.nrcprograms.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cin_hist_terminationpolicy|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ending the tribal rights as sovereign nations, the policy terminated federal support of most of the health care and education programs, utility services, and police and fire departments available to Indians on reservations.  Given the considerable geographic isolation of many reservations and inherent economic problems, not many tribes had the funds to continue such services after termination was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tigerman (2006)|pp=35–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tribes initially selected for termination had been considered groups who were the most successful in the United States, in some cases, because of natural resources controlled by their reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/termination_and_restoration/#.VJ3dxP-oDA|title=Termination and Restoration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few tribes mounted legal challenges to maintain tribal government and the trust relationship with the federal government. Through the [[Indian Claims Commission]], tribes had the ability to file claims against the government for breaches of treaty or grievances. The five year dead-line for making a claim, August 1951, caused many tribes to file in the months preceding the end of the registration period. In some instances, pending claims cases with complex legal issues aided the tribes in preventing termination, while in others, tribes were taken advantage of by government agents and their associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philp|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Termination Revisited: American Indians on the Trail to Self-Determination, 1933-1953|date=1999|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-3723-5|pages=21–33|edition=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68ggiC4QtRkC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and policy==

===The Kansas Act of 1940===
{{main|Kansas Act of 1940}}
Federal policy up until the 1940s had mainly held that the Federal Government had sole jurisdiction over Indians. The [[Kansas Act of 1940]] was "trial" legislation granting state jurisdiction over most criminal offenses committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations. If successful, it was to be implemented elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Kansas Law Review, Vol 59 (2011)"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kansas]] had been exercising jurisdiction over offenses, including those listed in the Indian Major Crimes Act, and their authority to do that was called into question. To clarify the state's authority, they proposed the act&lt;ref name="507 U. S. 99 (1993)"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; to fill a perceived gap in jurisdiction. None of the four federally recognized tribes living in Kansas: [[Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation|Potawatomi]], [[Kickapoo Tribe of Indians of the Kickapoo Reservation in Kansas|Kickapoo]], [[Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska|Sac &amp; Fox]], and [[Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska|Iowa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kansas Law Review, Vol 59 (2011)|p.951}}&lt;/ref&gt; had tribal courts to deal with offenses, and state jurisdiction did not extend to Indian lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|507 U. S. 99 (1993)|p. 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law, passed on 8 June 1940, as Title 25 U.S. Code § 217a ch. 276, 54 Stat. 249&lt;ref&gt;as Title 25 U.S. Code § 217a ch. 276, 54 Stat. 249&lt;/ref&gt; gave Kansas courts jurisdiction to try persons for conduct that violates state law, even if the federal government is also able to try the offense under federal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|507 U. S. 99 (1993)|p. 99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost immediately, similar statutes were passed in North Dakota, Iowa&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|507 U. S. 99 (1993)|p. 103-104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New York, granting state jurisdiction over most offenses committed by or against Indians in Indian country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2009-title25/html/USCODE-2009-title25-chap6.htm|title=U.S.C.

===Survey of Indian conditions===
In 1943 the [[United States Senate]] commissioned a survey of Indian conditions. It indicated that living conditions on the reservations were extremely poor. The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) and its bureaucracy were found to be at fault for the troubling problems due to extreme mismanagement.&lt;ref name="nrcprograms_policy"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Congress concluded that some tribes no longer needed federal 'protection' and would be better off with more independence, rather than having them depend on and be poorly supervised by the BIA.  They also thought the tribes should be assimilated to mainstream American society.&lt;ref name="nrcprograms_policy"/&gt; Goals of termination included freeing the Indians from domination by the BIA, repealing laws that discriminated against Indians, and ending federal supervision of Indians.&lt;ref name="cowcreek_termination"&gt;{{cite web

In 1953, the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the Senate announced their support for the termination policy, with [[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===North Dakota jurisdiction on Devils Lake Indian Reservation===
On 31 May 1946, Congress enacted ''An Act to confer jurisdiction on the State of [[North Dakota]] over offenses committed by or against Indians on the Devils Lake Indian Reservation'', [Public Law 394] 60 Stat. 229. In language reminiscent of the Kansas Act of 1940, the law granted the State of North Dakota jurisdiction for criminal offenses occurring on lands occupied by the [[Spirit Lake Tribe]], but retained the right of the federal government for jurisdiction on offenses against federal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0294.html#mn1]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Claims Commission Act===
{{main|Indian Claims Commission}}
In 1945, earnest discussion began on creating an [[Indian Claims Commission]]. The idea had been circulating for years but had never gained much momentum. However, in the wake of termination, it took on new life. Policymakers saw that settling claims would become the means to speed along the process of ending "Indian-identity" and move tribe members into the broader society. Simultaneously it would eliminate the need of the government to continue serving as tribal guardian,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philip (2002)|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or at the very least allow the government to reduce "appropriations for tribes in proportion to the size of their claim settlements".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philip (2002)|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 1946 the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-726, ch. 959, passed. Its purpose was to settle for all time any outstanding grievances or claims the tribes might have against the U.S. for treaty breaches, unauthorized taking of land, dishonorable or unfair dealings, or inadequate compensation. Claims had to be filed within a five-year period. Most of the 370 complaints that were submitted&lt;ref name="justice.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/3147.htm|title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : Lead up to the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were filed at the approach of the 5-year deadline in August 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philip (2002)|pp=21–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The life of the Commission was extended but eventually Congress terminated it on 30 September 1978; it transferred outstanding claims to the United States Court of Federal Claims. The final case, ''Pueblo of San Ildefenso v. United States'', was finally resolved in 2006.&lt;ref name="justice.gov"/&gt;

===Iowa jurisdiction on Sac and Fox Indian Reservation===
On 30 June 1948, Congress enacted ''An Act to confer jurisdiction on the State of [[Iowa]] over offenses committed by or against Indians on the Sac and Fox Indian Reservation'',  [Public Law 846] 62 Stat. 1161. In language reminiscent of the Kansas Act of 1940, the law granted the State of Iowa jurisdiction for criminal offenses occurring on lands occupied by the [[Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa]], but retained the right of the federal government for jurisdiction on offenses against federal law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0421.html#p421a]&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York Act of 1948===
On 2 July 1948 Congress enacted ''An Act to confer jurisdiction on the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] with respect to offenses committed on Indian reservations within such State'', [Public Law 881] 62 Stat. 1224. The language was virtually identical to the Kansas, North Dakota and Iowa statutes, with two important differences. It covered all reservations lands within the state and prohibited the deprivation of hunting and fishing rights which may have been guaranteed to "any Indian tribe, band, or community, or members thereof". It further prohibited the state from requiring tribal members to obtain fish and game licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0427b.html#p427b]&lt;/ref&gt;

===California Act of 1949===
On 5 October 1949 Congress enacted ''An Act to confer jurisdiction on the State of [[California]] over the lands and residents of the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians|Agua Caliente Indian]] Reservation in said State, and for other purposes'', [Public Law 322] 63 Stat. 705, which stated that "on and after January 1, 1950, all lands located on the Agua Caliente Indian Reservation in the State of California, and the Indian residents thereof, shall be subject to the laws, civil and criminal, of the State of California". The law also made provisions for the tribe and the Secretary of the Interior to negotiate easements for city improvements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0446c.html#p446c]&lt;/ref&gt; thus it did not terminate tribal status.

===New York Act of 1950===
Within two years, Congress was reviewing a second piece of legislation with regard to [[New York (state)|New York]], to grant the state civil as well as criminal jurisdiction over Indians and tribes. During congressional hearings on the law, tribes strongly opposed the passage, fearful that states would deprive them of their reservations. The State of New York disavowed any intention to break up or deprive tribes of their reservations and asserted that they "did not have the ability to do so".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shattuck (1991)|p. 169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 1950, Congress enacted ''An Act to confer jurisdiction on the courts of the State of New York with respect to civil actions between Indians or to which Indians are parties'', [Public Law 785] 64 Stat. 845,&lt;ref name="digital.library.okstate.edu"&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0518.html#p518a]&lt;/ref&gt; granted the courts of New York authority to settle civil disputes between Indians or Indians and others within the State. It allowed the tribes to preserve customs, prohibited taxation on reservations,&lt;ref name="Shattuck (1991)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymFLjaBFXqwC&amp;lpg|title= The Oneida Land Claims: A Legal History |first=George C. |last=Shattuck |publisher=Syracuse University Press |date=1991| pages = 168–169 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaffirmed hunting and fishing rights. It also prohibited the state from enforcing judgments regarding any land disputes or applying any State Laws to tribal lands or claims prior to the effective date of the law 13 September 1952.&lt;ref name="digital.library.okstate.edu"/&gt;

===House Concurrent Resolution 108===

[[House concurrent resolution 108|House Concurrent Resolution 108 of 1953]] was a formal statement issued on August 1, 1953 by the [[United States Congress]] announcing the official federal policy of termination. The resolution called for the immediate termination of the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead]], [[Klamath people|Klamath]], [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Turtle Mountain Chippewa]], as well as all tribes in the states of [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], and [[Texas]].  Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"/&gt; Individual members of terminated tribes were to become full United States citizens and have the benefits and obligations of any other United States citizens. The resolution also called for the [[Interior Department]] to identify quickly more tribes who appeared ready for termination in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96 House Concurrent Resolution 108] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608052514/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96 |date=June 8, 2007 }}, Digital History, University of Houston&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 21, 1954 memo by the Department of the Interior, reviewing the effects of Resolution 108, stated that bills to terminate 66,000 Indians ({{frac|1|7}} of the total population) were under consideration by Congress. In addition to the above list, the memo sets forth bill provisions for the terminations of the [[Iroquois]] Confederation of Six Nations, [[Seneca people|Seneca]], and the [[Oneida people|Oneida Tribe]] of Wisconsin (formerly of New York); the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]]; the [[Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas]]; a Kansas bill covering the [[Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation|Potawatomi]], the [[Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas|Kickapoo]], the [[Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska|Sac and Fox]], and the [[Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska|Iowa Tribe]]; and 41 California Rancherias.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc012737.pdf|date=1954-01-21|access-date=2018-01-27|format=pdf|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|title=Legislation Terminating Federal Controls Over Eight Indian Groups Submitted to Congress}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A memo dated January 19, 1955 for the BIA issued by the Department of the Interior indicates additional terminations are being reviewed in proposed legislation for four Indian communities of southern [[Minnesota]], including the [[Lower Sioux Indian Reservation|Lower Sioux Community]] in Redwood and Scott counties, the [[Upper Sioux Indian Reservation|New Upper Sioux Community]] in Yellow Medicine County, the [[Prairie Island Indian Community|Prairie Island Community]] in Goodhue County, and about 15 individuals living on restricted tracts in Yellow Medicine County.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc016182.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Law 280===

[[Public Law 280]], passed in 1953, gave State governments the power to assume jurisdiction over [[Indian reservation]]s, which had previously been excluded from state jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.tribal-institute.org/lists/pl280.htm
|title=Public Law 280
|publisher=The Tribal Court Clearinghouse
|date =1953-08-15
|accessdate =2007-05-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It immediately granted the state criminal and civil jurisdiction over Indian populations in [[California]], [[Nebraska]], [[Minnesota]], [[Oregon]], and [[Wisconsin]]. Special clauses prevented this law from being invoked on the [[Red Lake Reservation]] in Minnesota and the [[Warm Springs Reservation]] in Oregon. After being admitted as a state in 1958, [[Alaska]] was added to the list of covered states where termination would be the goal.  Public Law 280 also allowed any state to assume jurisdiction over Indian lands by a statute or an amendment to the state constitution.  This law made both the states and Native Americans unhappy: the former because they had new responsibilities without any increase in funding to support additional staff and supplies, the latter because they were subject to new state laws.&lt;ref name="Canby"&gt;William C. Canby, Jr., ''American Indian Law in a Nut Shell'', 3rd Edition,&lt;!--true?--&gt; (West Group, 1998) {{ISBN|978-0-314-22637-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal goal in implementing P.L. 280 was two-fold: 1) to fill the jurisdictional gap resulting from the native communities' lack of independent formal judicial systems, which had resulted in a general perception of lawlessness in their communities and 2) to assimilate native peoples and their tribes into the cultures of their neighbors by shifting the financial burden of prosecuting crimes in Indian Country to their respective states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v59/1-Leeds_FINAL.pdf], ''Kansas University Law Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

The main effect of Public Law 280 was to disrupt the relationship between the federal government and the Indian tribes. Previously the tribes had been regulated directly by the federal government. In ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled that state laws cannot be enforced on Indian land.  While this preserved a kind of sovereignty and independence for tribes on reservations, in other ways they depended on a complex bureaucracy for services.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt;

In 1955, [[Nevada]] extended state jurisdiction over public offenses "committed by or against Indians in the areas of Indian country" and determined that Indian customs and traditions which were inconsistent with any State law would not be given full force and effect in civil actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-041.html#NRS041Sec430|title=NRS: CHAPTER 41 - ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS IN PARTICULAR CASES CONCERNING PERSONS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montana]] enacted legislation covering criminal offenses for the Flathead Reservation.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1784&amp;context=mlr&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (state)]] passed a law in 1957 allowing tribes to voluntarily go under state jurisdiction and in 1963 assumed at least partial jurisdiction on all reservations within the state. In 1963, [[Idaho]] made provisions for tribes to be able to come under full jurisdiction of the State or operate with concurrent jurisdiction between Indian country and the State.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribal-institute.org/download/Indian%20Law%20Enforcement%20History.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Relocation Act of 1956===
{{main|Indian Relocation Act of 1956}}
As part of the Indian Termination Policy, The Indian Relocation Act of 1956, was passed. It was a federal law encouraging Native Americans, who lived on or near Indian reservations to relocate to urban areas for greater employment opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0771.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that between the 1950s and 1980s, as many as 750,000 Native Americans migrated to the cities, some as part of the relocation program, others on their own. By the 2000 census, the urban Indian population was 64% higher than it had been in the pre-termination era of the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/indiancountry/history/relocate.html|title=Indian Country Diaries . History . 1950s Relocation Program - PBS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regaining federal recognition==
In 1968, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] proposed ending termination, building partnerships between tribal governments and the United States, and fostering tribal self-determination and self-development, though the proposal never passed. Subsequent presidents followed this informal approach until 1988, when House Concurrent Resolution 108 was formally abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/about/sovereignty/26287694.html|title=Federal Indian Policies|work=Oneida Indian Nation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216082057/http://www.oneidaindiannation.com/about/sovereignty/26287694.html|archivedate=2014-12-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the more than one hundred tribes terminated during this era, many regained federal recognition. The tribes achieved this through long court battles, which for some tribes took decades and exhausted large amounts of money.

Some tribes, like the [[Choctaw]] and [[Seneca people|Seneca]], were able to delay termination long enough to have it cancelled before implementation. Other tribes were marked for termination, like the Cold Springs, Middletown, and Montgomery Creek Rancherias of California and the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma but, due to errors in process, were not successfully terminated. Some tribes such as the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin]] and [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community]] pursued federal litigation to halt termination. Still others, though marked for termination, fought the process and prevented laws from coming out of committee or reaching the floor for a vote.

Tribal leaders played key roles in getting their cases heard by the [[United States Congress]], through the political process, and by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in suits and appeals. The tribes garnered publicity by creating resistance groups.  These both publicly protested the termination policy, and fought political and court battles in Washington for restoration of tribal sovereignty or other goals.

===Re-recognized and restored tribes===
&lt;!-- This would be easier to read as a two-column list --&gt;
Tribes which were terminated but regained their status as federally recognized sovereign states include:

===Tribes still seeking recognition and restoration===
Other tribes are still attempting to gain federal recognition, such as the [[Colfax Todds Valley Consolidated Tribe]] of California, [[Mishewal Wappo]] Indians of Alexander Valley of California, [[Miwok]] Tribe of the [[El Dorado Rancheria]] of California, [[Mission Creek Reservation]] of California, [[Mono Indian]]s of the [[Strathmore Rancheria]] of California, [[Nisenan]] of the [[Nevada City Rancheria]] of Northern California, [[Strawberry Valley Band]] of [[Pakan'yani Maidu]], [[Tsi Akim]] [[Maidu]] of the [[Taylorsville Rancheria]] of California, and the [[Mixed Bloods]] of the [[Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation]], The Salinan Tribe in California.

The [[Lumbee]] have been recognized as an American Indian tribe by the State of [[North Carolina]] since 1885. In 1956, the U.S. Congress also recognized the Lumbee as an American Indian tribe but denied federal Indian benefits. The 1956 Lumbee Act blocked the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|BIA]] from fully recognizing the Lumbee and withheld the full benefits of federal recognition from the tribe. Efforts are currently underway to pass federal legislation that will grant full recognition.

The [[Chinookan peoples|Chinook Indian Nation]] was terminated and has been fighting for restoration. In 2001 the US Congress endorsed restoring four bands of the Chinook Indian Nation: the [[Cathlamet people|Cathlamet]] (Oregon), [[Clatsop]] (Oregon), [[Chinookan peoples|Wahkiakum]] (Washington) and [[Chinookan peoples|Lower Columbia Chinook]] (Washington), but reversed the decision in 2002. An appeal is in process.

The [[Brothertown Indians]] of Wisconsin were the first tribe in the US to accept United States citizenship in 1839 and have their communal land allocated to individual households, in order to prevent removal further west. In a 2012 final determination on the Brothertown petition for federal recognition, the Department of the Interior determined that since Congress granted them citizenship which terminated their tribal status, only Congress could restore the tribe's federal recognition. They are still attempting to gain restoration.

==Repudiation==
[[File:President Richard Nixon and former President Lyndon B. Johnson at the dedication of the LBJ Library, 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Presidents [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and [[Richard Nixon]] favored [[Self-determination#United States|self-determination]] instead of termination.]]
By the early 1960s, some federal leaders began opposing the implementation of any more termination measures, although the administration of President [[John F. Kennedy]] did oversee some of the last terminations. The last two terminations occurred in the 1960s, those of the [[Ponca Tribe of Nebraska]], legally began in 1962—after Kennedy signed the order, at the urging of Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall—and culminated in 1966;&lt;ref&gt;Charles F. Wilkinson and Eric R. Biggs, "Evolution of Termination Policy", ''American Indian Law Review'' 5, no. 1 (1977): 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and that of the [[Ysleta del Sur Pueblo|Tiwa Indians of Ysleta, Texas]] which transferred federal authority to the State of Texas in 1968.&lt;ref name="uscode.house.gov"&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=82&amp;page=93&lt;/ref&gt;  Presidents [[Lyndon B.

The second reason for rejecting forced termination is that the practical results have been clearly harmful in the few instances in which termination actually has been tried. ...

Some tribes resisted termination by filing civil [[lawsuit]]s. The litigation lasted until 1980, when the issue made its way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]. The 1974 [[Boldt Decision]] was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1980, recognizing that tribes retained treaty rights for fishing and hunting, including the right to conduct such activities off the reservation and without state regulation.

Activism in the 1960s led to the founding of several Native American rights organizations, such as the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), and other organizations that helped protect the rights of Indians and their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harborside.com/~indianed/history.htm

On January 24, 1983, President [[Ronald Reagan]] issued an American Indian policy statement that supported explicit repudiation of the termination policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/indian/pdfs/reagan83.pdf |format=PDF |title=American Indian Policy by Ronald Reagan |accessdate=2007-05-01 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribes which evaded termination==
Termination, although often accompanied with pressure and coercion, was considered "voluntary" and required tribal consent.&lt;ref name="opi.mt.gov"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://opi.mt.gov/pdf/IndianEd/IEFA/FlatheadTimeline.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229051526/http://opi.mt.gov/pdf/IndianEd/IEFA/FlatheadTimeline.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the tribes in this category may have had a formal termination agreement approved, but they were successful at warding off termination until repudiation, or terms of their agreement were unmet. Other tribes in this category were approved for termination, but were successful in testifying before Congress that they should not be terminated.

===Iroquois Confederation of the Six Nations===
Beginning in 1953, a Federal task force began meeting with the tribes of the Six Nations. Despite tribal objections, legislation was introduced into Congress for termination.&lt;ref name="srmt-nsn.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srmt-nsn.gov/government/culture_and_history/|title=Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe - Culture and History|publisher=|access-date=2014-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220040158/http://www.srmt-nsn.gov/government/culture_and_history/|archive-date=2014-12-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed legislation involved more than 11,000 Indians of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederation]] and was divided into two separate bills. One bill dealt with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Oneida Indian Nation|Oneida]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]] and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] tribes and the other dealt with the Seneca (see {{section link|#Seneca Nation}}).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The arguments the Six Nations made in their hearings with committees were that their treaties showed that the United States recognized that their lands belonged to the Six Nations, not the United States and that "termination contradicted any reasonable interpretation that their lands would not be claimed or their nations disturbed" by the federal government.&lt;ref name="Johansen (2000)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zibNDBchPkMC&amp;lpg|title= Encyclopedia of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) |first=Bruce Elliott and Barbara Alice Mann |last=Johansen |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |date=2000| isbn = 0-313-30880-2 | page = 42 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill for the Iroquois Confederation died in committee without further serious consideration.&lt;ref name="srmt-nsn.gov"/&gt;

==="Emigrant Indians" of New York===
{{further|Brothertown Indians|Mingo|Stockbridge-Munsee|Christian Munsee}}

A January 21, 1954 memo by the Department of the Interior advised that a bill for termination is to be prepared including "about 3,600 members of the Oneida Tribe residing in Wisconsin. These Indians have no land in Federal trusteeship and are not receiving any Federal services in such fields as health or education."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Clarification of who these tribes were was found in a Department of the Interior memo entitled ''Indian Claims Commission Awards Over $38.5 Million to Indian Tribes in 1964'', which states that the Emigrant Indians of New York are "now known as the [[Oneida Nation of Wisconsin|Oneidas]], [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community|Stockbridge-Munsee]], and [[Brothertown Indians|Brotherton]] Indians of Wisconsin".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc017133.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to fight termination and force the government into recognizing their outstanding land claims from New York, the three tribes began filing litigation in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="iwantthenews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwantthenews.com/main.asp?Search=1&amp;ArticleID=21652&amp;SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=74&amp;S=1|title=Efforts have gone on for years to get Brothertown recognition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of a claim filed with the Indian Claims Commission, the group was awarded a settlement of $1,313,472.65 on August 11, 1964.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; To distribute the funds, Congress passed Public Law 90-93  81 Stat. 229 ''Emigrant New York Indians of Wisconsin Judgment Act'' and prepared separate rolls of persons in each of the three groups to determine which tribal members had at least one-quarter "Emigrant New York Indian blood". It further directed tribal governing bodies of the Oneidas and Stockbridge-Munsee to apply to the Secretary of the Interior for approval of fund distributions, thereby ending termination efforts for these tribes. With regard to the Brothertown Indians, however, though the law did not specifically state they were terminated, it authorized all payments to be made directly to each enrollee with special provisions for minors to be handled by the Secretary. The payments were not subject to state or federal taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol6/html_files/v6p1104b.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215600/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol6/html_files/v6p1104b.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When guidelines were established in 1978 to regain federal recognition, the [[Brothertown Indians]] submitted a petition. It was rejected because they had lost federal recognition through congressional legislation granting them citizenship. The Bureau of Indian Affairs acknowledged in 1993 that the federal government had recognized them as a sovereign tribe in treaties for 1831, 1832 and in the "1839 act which granted them citizenship and gave the tribe land in Wisconsin". Based on these findings the tribe petitioned the Department of the Interior again.&lt;ref name="iwantthenews.com"/&gt; In 2012 the Department, in the final determination on the Brothertown petition, determined that the tribal status of the group was terminated by the 1839 act granting citizenship. The acting Assistant Secretary noted that only Congress could restore the tribal status.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc-021437.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In an ongoing effort to regain recognition, the tribe asked the Town Board of Brothertown, Wisconsin for support. In a vote held on 27 December 2013, the town refused to endorse a plan to seek Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwantthenews.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=22293|title=Town action surprises tribe, county|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederated Salish and Kootenai Nation===
In 1954 at Congressional hearings, the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead Tribes]] were able to resist the government's plans to terminate their tribe.&lt;ref name="opi.mt.gov"/&gt; An opinion issued April 8, 1980 in the US District court for the State of Montana confirmed that the Flathead Reservation held in trust by the US Government had not been diminished nor terminated since enactment of ''The Flathead Act'' of April 23, 1904. It further clarified that Congress's intent to terminate must be clear and cannot be inferred, stating "A congressional determination to terminate must be expressed on the face of the Act or be clear from the surrounding circumstances and legislative history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openjurist.org/665/f2d/951/confederated-salish-and-kootenai-tribes-of-flathead-reservation-montana-v-m-namen|title=665 F2d 951 Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation Montana v.

===Kansas tribes===
Because jurisdiction over criminal matters had already been transferred to the State of Kansas by the passage of the [[Kansas Act of 1940]], the government targeted the four tribes in Kansas for immediate termination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In February 1954 joint hearings for the Kansas tribes were held by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Indian Affairs.&lt;ref name="Davis: Native America (1996)"&gt;{{cite web

The strong opposition from the Potawatomi and Kickapoo tribes helped them, as well as the [[Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska|Sac &amp; Fox]] and the [[Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska|Iowa Tribe]], avoid termination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis: Native America (1996)|p. 286–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chippewa Indians of the Turtle Mountain Reservation===
Though termination legislation was introduced (Legislation 4. S. 2748, H.R. 7316. 83rd Congress. Termination of Federal Supervision over Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apps.library.und.edu/archon/index.php?p=collections/findingaid&amp;id=360&amp;q=&amp;rootcontentid=50924#id50924|title=Otto Krueger Papers, 1953-1958 - Elwyn B. Robinson Department of Special Collections|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the law was not implemented. In 1954, at the Congressional hearings for the [[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians]], tribal Chairman Patrick Gourneau and a delegation spoke in Washington, DC. They testified that the group was not financially prepared, had high unemployment and poverty, suffered from low education levels, and termination would be devastating to the tribe. Based on their testimony, the Chippewa were dropped from the tribes to be terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndstudies.org/resources/IndianStudies/turtlemountain/historical_1900s.html|title=Turtle Mountain - Tribal Historical Overview - Early 1900s|publisher=|access-date=2014-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102004633/http://www.ndstudies.org/resources/IndianStudies/turtlemountain/historical_1900s.html|archive-date=2015-01-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minnesota Sioux Communities===
Discussions between the BIA and the Indians from the [[Lower Sioux Indian Reservation|Lower Sioux Community]] in Redwood and Scott counties, the [[Upper Sioux Indian Reservation|New Upper Sioux Community]] in Yellow Medicine County, the [[Prairie Island Indian Community|Prairie Island Community]] in Goodhue County and some scattered individuals living on restricted tracts in Yellow Medicine County&lt;ref name="BIA 19 January 1955"&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposed Terminal Legislation for Indians of Southern Minnesota|url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc016182.pdf|publisher=Department of the Interior|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; began in 1953 and continued throughout 1954. Though the Prairie Island and Lower Sioux communities drafted agreements with individual land ownership, the Upper Sioux strongly opposed fee simple title to tribal lands.

On January 26, 1955, Senator Edward Thye introduced into Congress a bill (S704) to provide for termination of the tribes. Opposition, not only of the Dakota, but of other citizens who realized their state expenses might increase, were made to the committee reviewing the bill. The Governor's Commission on Human Rights also opposed the legislation, indicating that it would "not adequately protect the interests of the Indians". The bill died in committee, never reaching the Senate floor.&lt;ref name=Meyer(1993)&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2TORYr13BYC&amp;lpg|title= History of the Santee Sioux: United States Indian Policy on Trial |first=Roy Willard |last=Meyer |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |date=1993| isbn = 0-8032-8203-6 | page = 354 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seminole Tribe of Florida===
Being proposed for termination galvanized the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]]. On 9 October 1953, an emergency meeting was called at the agency headquarters on the Dania Reservation. There were two issues to be considered: 1) convincing the government that the tribe was not ready to take over management of its own affairs and 2) convincing the government that not all native people living in Florida were Seminole. On March 1–2, 1954, designated tribal members testified at a Joint Hearing before the Subcommittees of the Committees on Interior and Insular Affairs of the 83rd Congress. Additional hearings were held 6–7 April 1955, requesting the continuance for the next 25 years of government supervision and separation of the Seminoles from the Miccosukees and Traditionals. By March 26, 1957, a committee had been formed to draft a constitution and corporate charter. The constitution and bylaws were accepted by tribal vote on August 21, 1957&lt;ref name="semtribe.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semtribe.com/SeminoleTribune/Archive/40anniversary/destinyvote.html|title=Seminole Tribe of Florida: Seminole Tribune|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ratified by Congress later that same year. The Miccosukees formed their own government, receiving state recognition in 1957 and federal recognition as the [[Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]] in 1962. Some Traditionals refused to affiliate with either tribe, not wanting relations with the federal government.&lt;ref name=Mahon203204&gt;Mahon, pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma===
On August 1, 1956, the US Congress passed Public Law ch. 843, 70 Stat. 893 to terminate the [[Wyandotte Nation|Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma]]. Three years were allotted for completion of termination&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=70&amp;page=893&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the stipulations required that a parcel of land in Kansas City, Kansas reserved as the Huron Cemetery which had been awarded to the Wyandottes by treaty on January 31, 1855 was to be sold by the United States. Litigation was filed by a group of Absentee Wyandots against the United States and the City of Kansas City, Kansas which resulted in an inability of the US to fulfill the terms of the termination statute and ultimately kept the Wyandotte Tribe from being terminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=search&amp;case=/data2/circs/10th/003063.html|title=FindLaw - Cases and Codes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Land Management records confirm that the Federal Register never published the termination of the Wyandotte lands and thus they were never officially terminated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

To clarify the uncertainty, since an actual act had been passed, when Congress restored the other [[Indian termination policy#Oklahoma Termination Acts|Oklahoma Tribes]], it included the Wyandotte in the repeal. On May 15, 1978, in a single Act, entitled Public Law 95-281, the termination laws were repealed and the three tribes were reinstated with all rights and privileges they had prior to termination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=92&amp;page=246&lt;/ref&gt;

===California Rancherias===
41 Rancherias in California were approved for termination under the original terms of the 1958 [[Indian termination policy#California Rancheria Termination Act|California Rancheria Termination Act]], Public Law 85-671 and another 7 Rancherias were targeted in the 1964 amendment to the Act. For five of the Rancherias terminations were not completed by the US government:

===Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma===
{{main|Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma#Termination Efforts 1950s}}
After eleven years as Choctaw chief, [[Harry J. W. Belvin]] persuaded Representative [[Carl Albert]] of Oklahoma to introduce federal legislation to begin terminating the Choctaw tribe, as a means to circumvent BIA intrusion into tribal funds and government.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)" /&gt; On April 23, 1959, the BIA confirmed that H.R. 2722 had been submitted to Congress at the request of the tribe, and would sell all remaining tribal assets, but would not effect any individual Choctaw earnings. It also provided for retention of half of all mineral rights which could be managed by a tribal corporation.&lt;ref name="BIA - 23 April 1959"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department Supports Choctaw Termination Bill Introduced in Congress at the Request of Tribal Representatives|url=http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc016731.pdf|publisher=Department of the Interior|accessdate=December 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 1959, Congress passed a bill&lt;ref name="Public Law 86-192"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Law 86-192 |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol6/html_files/v6p0882.html |publisher=US Code |accessdate=December 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123135051/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0882.html |archivedate=23 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to terminate the tribe, which was later called ''Belvin's law'' as he was the main advocate behind it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;Valerie Lambert, ''Political Protest, Conflict, and Tribal Nationalism: The Oklahoma Choctaws and the Termination Crisis of 1959–1970''&lt;/ref&gt; In actuality, the provisions of the bill were  intended to be a final disposition of all trust obligations and a final "dissolution of the tribal governments".&lt;ref name="BIA - 23 April 1959"/&gt; The original Act was to have expired in 1962, but was amended twice to allow more time to sell the tribal assets. As time wore on, Belvin realized that the bill severed the tribe members access to government loans and other services, including the tribal tax exemption. By 1967, he had asked Oklahoma Congressman [[Ed Edmondson (politician)|Ed Edmondson]] to try to repeal the termination act.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)" /&gt; Congress finally repealed the law on August 24, 1970.&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

===Seneca Nation===
On August 31, 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/88/hr1794/text|title=Text of H.R. 1794 (88th): An Act to authorize payment for certain interests in lands within the Allegheny ...

The bill authorized payment for resettling and rehabilitation of the [[Seneca people|Seneca Indians]]. As part of their reservation was effected by the construction of the Kinzua Dam on the Allegheny River, 127 Seneca families (about 500) people were being dislocated. The legislation provided benefits for the entire Seneca Nation, because the taking of the Indian land for the dam broke (abridged) a 1794 treaty between the Government and the Senecas. In addition, the bill provided that within three years, a plan from the Interior Secretary should be submitted to Congress withdrawing all federal supervision over the Seneca Nation. (Technically the state of New York, and not the Federal Government, had had supervision over the Senecas since 1949.)&lt;ref&gt;http://library.cqpress.com/cqalmanac/document.php?id=cqal64-1304836&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, on September 5, 1967, a memo from the Department of the Interior announced that legislation had been proposed to end federal ties with the Seneca.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc017446.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/55963524/|title=Warren Times-Mirror and Observer from Warren, Pennsylvania · Page 9|work=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 a new liaison was appointed from the BIA for the tribe to assist the tribe in preparing for termination and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;http://bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc015564.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Choctaw, the Seneca were able to hold off termination until President Nixon issued&lt;ref name=Hauptman2013&gt;''In the Shadow of Kinzua: The Seneca Nation of Indians Since World War II'', Syracuse University Press, Laurence Marc Hauptman 2013, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; his ''Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs'' in July 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2573|title=Richard Nixon: Special Message to the Congress on Indian Affairs.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictional terminations and restorations==
Termination acts were passed dealing with particular tribes or groups of tribes because of special circumstances.  They followed the basic termination policies, but sometimes had minor variations. In some cases, when termination was reversed, the government granted recognition, but no restoration of federal trust lands occurred. Some of those tribes, specifically in California, are still seeking restoration of reservation lands.

===Menominee Termination Act===
The [[Menominee]] tribe of [[Wisconsin]] was one of the first tribes proposed for termination. Observers believed they did not need governmental services because of the value of their timber lands.  On June 17, 1954, Congress passed the Menominee Termination Act, ending the special relationship between the [[Menominee]] tribe of Wisconsin and the federal government.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt; Though the act was passed in 1954, it was not until April 30, 1961, that they were officially terminated.

The Menominee did not initially cooperate with the new policy. They had recently won a court case against the government over mismanagement of forestry enterprises, and Senator Watkins threatened to withhold the $8.5 million settlement unless the Menominee agreed to termination. Previously, the tribe had been able to support themselves and fund most social programs with revenue generated by the logging industry and lumber mill. Their economic situation, however, was precarious since they only had one resource.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"/&gt;

This act was unique because it left out termination of Menominee hunting and fishing rights. The state of [[Wisconsin]] tried to subject the Menominee tribe to state hunting and fishing regulations, including requiring individuals to get permits for hunting. When the tribe filed suit against the state to defend their treaty rights, the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] upheld these regulations. They ruled that Congress had abrogated all Menominee hunting and fishing rights by passing the Menominee Termination Act.&lt;ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com"&gt;Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, Certiorari to the U.S. Court of Claims, No. 187, 1968. (Transcript at Caselaw.lp){{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=391&amp;invol=404 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401073426/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=391&amp;invol=404 |archivedate=2008-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribe appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1968 in ''[[Menominee Tribe v. United States]]''.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court found that termination of a tribe did not abrogate treaty rights unless there was specific legislative intent to do so.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt; The Menominees' hunting and fishing rights were guaranteed under the Wolf River Treaty of 1854. Since the Menominee Termination Act made no mention of these treaty hunting and fishing rights, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the treaty rights had not been abrogated.  They ruled that the Menominee were still entitled to their traditional hunting and fishing rights free from state control.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt;

The Wisconsin Supreme Court had gone against Public Law 280 when they denied the Menominee their hunting and fishing rights (124 N.W.2d 41, 1963). Public Law 280 explicitly states that "Nothing in this section ... shall deprive any Indian or any Indian tribe, band, or community of any right, privilege, or immunity afforded under Federal treaty, agreement or statute with respect to hunting, trapping, or fishing or the control, licensing, or regulation thereof."&lt;ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com"/&gt; These proceedings show that while the abrogation of federal treaties is legal (under ''[[Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]]''), Congressional intent to abrogate these treaties cannot be inferred, it must be explicit. Unless specifically abrogated by Congress, treaty rights remain in effect, whether a tribe is terminated or not.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt;

After they were terminated, the commonly held land and money were transferred to the corporation Menominee Enterprises, Inc. (MEI), and the geographical area of the reservation was admitted to the state as a new county. [[Menominee County, Wisconsin|Menominee County]] soon became the poorest county in the state. MEI funds were rapidly depleted. Concern about corruption within MEI, including its selling of former tribal land, led community members such as Ada Deer and James White to form a group called the Determination of Rights and Unity for Menominee Stockholders (DRUMS) in 1970.

They fought to regain control of MEI and, by the end of 1972, they controlled the corporation. The activists worked to restore Menominee tribal government and regain sovereignty. Their success was reflected in the [[Menominee Restoration Act]], signed by President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1973. With the help of the Menominee Restoration Committee (MCR), the reservation was reformed in 1975, a tribal constitution was signed in 1976, and the new tribal government took over in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Milwaukee Public Museum- http://www.mpm.edu/wirp/ICW-97.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klamath Termination Act===
{{main|Klamath Termination Act}}
The [[Klamath people|Klamath]] tribe in [[Oregon]] was terminated under the ''[[Klamath Termination Act]]'', or Public Law 587, enacted on August 13, 1954. Under this act, all federal supervision over Klamath lands, as well as federal aid provided to the Klamath because of their special status as Indians, was terminated.&lt;ref name="altlaw.org"&gt;
Charles E. KIMBALL et al., Plaintiffs-Appellants, v. John D. CALLAHAN et al., Defendants-Appellees. United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, February 26, 1974. 493 F.2d 564 [http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/451260]&lt;/ref&gt;
The legislation required each tribal member to choose between remaining a member of the tribe, or withdrawing and receiving a monetary payment for the value of the individual share of tribal land.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"/&gt;
Those who stayed became members of a tribal management plan. This plan became a trust relationship between tribal members and the United States National Bank in Portland, Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;Hood, Susan, "The Termination of the Klamath Indian Tribe of Oregon", ''The American Society for Ethnohistory'', 1972 [https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0014-1801(197223)19%3A4%3C379%3ATOTKIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-F]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 2,133 members of the Klamath tribe at the time of termination, 1,660 decided to withdraw from the tribe and accept individual payments for land.&lt;ref name="altlaw.org"/&gt;

The termination of the Klamath Reservation, in actuality included three distinct but affiliated tribes. The Act defines the members as the "Klamath and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Tribes and the Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians, and of the individual members thereof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/564a|title=25 U.S. Code § 564a - Definitions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma|Modoc Tribe]], had been taken as prisoners to Indian Territory in 1873 following the Modoc War in Oregon. In 1965, as a part of the US settlement with the Klamath reservation, a series of hearings were held from April to August. The hearings concluded without allowing the [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma|Oklahoma Modoc]] to be included in the rolls of the Klamath Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;http://soda.sou.edu/Data/Library1/020617a1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, the western Modoc were restored to tribal status on May 15, 1978, in an Act which reinstated the Modoc, Wyandotte, Peoria and Ottawa Tribes of Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; Almost a decade later, through the leadership and vision of the Klamath people, and the assistance of a few congressional leaders, the Klamath Restoration Act was adopted into law in 1986, reestablishing the Klamath as a sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klamathtribes.org/background/termination.html |title=The Klamath Tribes -Termination |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321002925/http://www.klamathtribes.org/background/termination.html |archivedate=2015-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Oregon Indian Termination Act===
{{main|The Western Oregon Indian Termination Act}}
[[The Western Oregon Indian Termination Act]], or Public Law 588, was passed in August 1954. It called for termination of federal supervision over the trust and restricted property of numerous Native American bands and small tribes, all located west of the [[Cascade Mountains]] in Oregon.&lt;ref name="PublicLaw588"&gt;''Public Law 588, August 13, 1954''. ''Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties, Vol. VI'' (Washington: Government Printing Office), p. 641 [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/KAPPLER/vol6/html_files/v6p0641.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
The act also called for disposition of federally owned property which had been bought for the administration of Indian affairs, and for termination of federal services which these Indians received under federal recognition.&lt;ref name="PublicLaw588"/&gt; The stipulations in this act were similar to those of most termination acts.

The Western Oregon Indian Termination Act was unique because of the number of tribes it affected. In all, 61 tribes in western Oregon were terminated. This total of tribes numbered more than the total of those terminated under all other individual acts.&lt;ref name="PublicLaw588"/&gt; The history of the area, with the Coastal Reservation being established by Executive Order and not treaty, then separated into the Siletz and Grande Ronde Reservations, then those two reservations being combined, and yet again separated, makes the situation complicated, and difficult to ascertain specific tribal data.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/10067/Lewis_Daivd_Gene_phd2009wi.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt;  The final roll of the [[Confederated Tribes of Siletz]] contained 929 names and &lt;ref&gt;http://soda.sou.edu/awdata/021029d1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the final roll of the [[Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde]] contained 862 names.&lt;ref name="Lewis: Termination of the Grand Ronde (2009)"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6dx-9l2v17wC&amp;lpg|title= Termination of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon: Politics, Community, Identity |first=David Gene|last= Lewis |publisher=University of Oregon|date=2009|accessdate=2014-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined total of these two confederations' population was 1,791, though there may well have been scattered native peoples in the coastal region who were not affiliated with these reservations.

There were restoration acts that restored all of the bands who had tribe members that had been located on the Grand Ronde or Silez Reservations. Some of these tribes were restored with those acts and later obtained their own federal recognition.

===Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas Termination Act===
On August 23, 1954, the United States Congress passed two laws to terminate the federal relationship with the [[Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas]]. Public Law ch. 831, §1, 68 Stat. 768 provided that the Secretary of the Interior was to transfer to the State of Texas the tribal lands for the benefit of the tribe. In addition, it terminated the federal trust relationship to the tribe and the individual members of the tribe and canceled any federal debts.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=68&amp;page=768&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 1983, Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox released an opinion (JM-17) stating that the state's assumption of power over the property of the Alabama-Coushatta was a violation of the Texas Constitution. He stated that as the federal government had withdrawn its recognition that the tribe was "merely an unincorporated association under Texas law, with the same legal status as other private associations ... the 3,071 acre tract is entirely free from any legally meaningful designation as an 'Indian Reservation{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/opinions/opinions/47mattox/op/1983/htm/jm0017.htm|title=Mattox Opinion No. JM-17|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119131158/https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/opinions/opinions/47mattox/op/1983/htm/jm0017.htm|archivedate=2016-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns by the tribe, Representative Ronald D.

===Ute Indians of Utah===
On August 27, 1954, the US Congress passed Public Law 671 Chapter ch. 1009 68 Stat. 868 to partition the [[Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation]] in Utah between the mixed-blood and full-blood members. The Act provided for termination of federal supervision over the mixed-blood members, terminated their access to Indian Health Services and allowed for a distribution of assets to them. In addition it created a development program to assist the full-blood members to prepare for federal termination.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=68&amp;page=868&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone with less than half Ute blood was automatically classified as part of the mixed-blood group. Anyone with more than half Ute blood quantum was allowed to choose which group they wished to be part of going forward.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc016125.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Act, the mixed-bloods were to select representatives in an unincorporated association, the Affiliated Ute Citizens (AUC), which in turn created the Ute Distribution Corporation (UDC) to manage their oil, gas, and mineral rights and unliquidated claims against the federal government as part of the plan for distributing assets to individual mixed-bloods. The UDC issued stock shares to mixed-bloods and which could be redeemed through the First Security Bank of Utah. Mixed-bloods who wanted to dispose of their stock prior to August 27, 1964, had to give first-refusal rights to tribe members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/406/128|title=AFFILIATED UTE CITIZENS OF the State of UTAH et al., Petitioners, v.

In November 2002, mixed-bloods whose citizenship in the tribe had been terminated filed a civil action in the Washington DC US District Court, ''Felter vs. Kempthorne'', to repeal the Ute Partition Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undeclaredutes.net/|title=The Mixed-Blood Uinta's of Utah, "Our Journey to Justice Continues"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 27 January 2006, the case was dismissed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undeclaredutes.net/pdf/a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and an appeal was filed.

===Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah===
On September 1, 1954, the US Congress passed ''Termination of Federal Supervision over [[Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah|Paiute Indians of Utah]]'' U.S. Code, Title 25, Sections 741-60. The legislation at §742 specified that the included bands were the Shivwits, Kanosh, Koosharem, and Indian Peaks Bands of the Paiute Indian Tribe (omitting the Cedar Band).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/742|title=25 U.S. Code § 742 - Definitions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other termination agreements, the Act provided for termination of federal trusts and distribution of tribal lands to individuals or a tribally organized entity. It had provisions to preserve the tribal water rights and a special education program to assist tribal members in learning how to earn a living, conduct affairs, and assume their responsibilities as citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-14/subchapter-XXXII|title=25 U.S. Code Chapter 14, Subchapter XXXII - PAIUTE INDIANS OF UTAH: TERMINATION OF FEDERAL SUPERVISION|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Land management terminated tribal trusts on March 1, 1957,&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GAOREPORTS-GAO-07-23R/html/GAOREPORTS-GAO-07-23R.htm|title=Indian Issues: BLM's Program for Issuing Individual Indian Allotments on Public Lands Is No Longer Viable|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the Indian Health Service.&lt;ref name="bulk.resource.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1762_01.sgml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723100357/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1762_01.sgml |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 1980, Congress passed the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Restoration Act, Public Law 96-227 94 Stat. 317, which restored the federal trust relationship of the Shivwits, Kanosh, Koosharem, and Indian Peaks Bands of the Paiute Indian Tribe and restored and reaffirmed that the Cedar Band was part of the Tribe. The law acknowledged that the Kanosh, Koosharem, and Indian Peaks Bands had lost their lands as a result of termination and that the Cedar Band had never had any. It proposed to develop within two years of enactment a plan to secure reservation land for the tribe not to exceed 15,000 acres.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-94/pdf/STATUTE-94-Pg317.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Land management reinstituted the federal trust on 43,576.99 concurrent with the enactment of the statute.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

===Oklahoma Termination Acts===
On August 1, 2, and 3, 1956, Congress passed three related Acts terminating the federal supervision of the [[Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma]];&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=70&amp;page=963&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Peoria Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma]];&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=70&amp;page=937&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Wyandotte Nation|Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; All three Acts were substantially identical and called for the termination of federal supervision over trust lands at the end of three years by creating the means to transfer to individual members the property of the tribes. The [[Indian termination policy#Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma|Wyandotte Nation]] was not successfully terminated due to a legal complication.

On May 15, 1978, in a single Act, entitled Public Law 95-281, the termination laws were repealed and the three tribes were reinstated with all rights and privileges they had prior to termination.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; A special section of the Reinstatement Act addresses the [[Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma]] confirming that the provisions of the [[Indian termination policy#Klamath Termination Act|Klamath Termination Act]] did not apply to them except as provided for sharing in future claims against the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

===California Rancheria Termination Act===
{{main|California Rancheria Termination Acts}}
Three [[California Rancheria Termination Acts]] (and an amendment) were passed in the 1950s and 1960s. The first Act, passed in 1956, the second in 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zf6ZU2M8NMQC&amp;lpg|title= American Indian Nations from Termination to Restoration, 1953–2006 |first=Roberta |last=Ulrich |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |date=2010| isbn = 978-0-8032-3364-5 | page = 127 |accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the final act of 1958 targeted 41 Rancherias for termination and an additional 7 under an amendment of 1964.

The first termination occurred on March 29, 1956, for the [[Koi Nation|Koi Nation of the Lower Lake Rancheria]] in two laws, Public Law 443 [H. R. 585] 70 Stat. 58&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0721.html#p721a&lt;/ref&gt; and Public Law 751 [H. R. 11163] 70 Stat. 595 which amended the description of the property.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0749.html#p749a&lt;/ref&gt;  After years of attempting to have their status reaffirmed, the Bureau of Indian Affairs "citing oversights in official records",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koination.com/history3.htm|title=Koi Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognized the tribe on December 29, 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

The second termination occurred on July 10, 1957, when the [[Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians]] was displaced with passage of Public Law 85-91 71 Stat. 283 authorizing the sale of the [[Coyote Valley Reservation|Coyote Valley Rancheria]] by the Secretary of the Interior to the Secretary of the Army for the Russian River Basin project to build the Coyote Valley Dam.&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/vol6/html_files/v6p0782.html#p782a&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Koi Nation, this may have been a recording error, as the tribe is a federally recognized entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/state-tribal-institute/list-of-federal-and-state-recognized-tribes.aspx#State|title=List of Federal and State Recognized Tribes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One final Rancheria appears to have been terminated prior to the 1958 Act. According to the Indian Health program records, [[Laguna Rancheria]] was terminated as of February 4, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1762_01.sgml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723100357/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/juris/j1762_01.sgml |archivedate=2012-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 18, 1958, Congress passed the California Rancheria Termination Act, Public Law 85-671 ({{USStat|72|619}}). The act called for the distribution of all 41 [[rancheria]] communal lands and assets to individual tribe members.&lt;ref&gt;''Public Law 85-671, August 18, 1958''. ''Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties, Vol. VI'' (Washington: Government Printing Office), p. 831 [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/KAPPLER/vol6/html_files/v6p0831.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the land could be distributed, the act called for a government survey of land on the rancheria. The government was required to improve or construct all roads serving the rancheria, to install or rehabilitate irrigation, sanitation, and domestic water systems, and to exchange land held in trust for the rancheria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/9th/0417482p.pdf|title=WILLIAMS v. GOVER|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Indians who received a portion of the assets were ineligible to receive any more federal services rendered to them based on their status as Indians.

In 1964, an amendment to the California Rancheria Termination Act ({{USStat|78|390}}) was enacted, terminating additional rancheria lands. Overall, then, there were three rancherias terminated prior to Public Law 85-671, 41 mentioned in Public Law 85-671, an additional 7 included in the amendment of 1964 and 5 that were never terminated but were listed, correcting the number of California Rancherias terminated from the oft-cited 41 to 46 total terminations.

Many tribes expressed dissatisfaction with termination immediately.&lt;ref name="newspapers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/26019655/|title=The Fresno Bee The Republican from Fresno, California · Page 40|work=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal failures to live up to promised improvements and educational opportunities that were supposed to be part of an agreement to accept termination led eventually to lawsuits calling to reverse terminations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standupca.org/court-rulings/california-indian-issues/Jul%2012%2C%201979%20Tillie%20Hardwick%20Complaint%20for%20Declaratory%20injunctive%20relief%20damages.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successful challenge was for the [[Robinson Rancheria]] on March 22, 1977, and it was followed by 5 others: the [[Hopland Rancheria]] was restored on March 29, 1978; the [[Upper Lake Rancheria]] was restored on May 15, 1979; the [[Table Bluff Rancheria]] was restored on September 21, 1981; the [[Big Sandy Rancheria]] was restored on March 28, 1983; and the [[Table Mountain Rancheria]] was restored in June 1983. Each of these decisions only pertained to one reservation.

The success of these suits and frustration with unmet promises caused [[Tillie Hardwick]] in 1979 to consult with California Indian Legal Services, who decided to make a class action case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mail-archive.com/nativenews@mlists.net/msg03524.html|title=NATIVE_NEWS: In Memory and Respect: Tillie Hardwick helped preserve Indian reservations|author=Ish|date=20 July 1999|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, 1983, a U.S. District Court in ''Tillie Hardwick, et al. v. United States of America, et al.'' Case #C-79-1710-SW ordered federal recognition of 17 of California's Rancherias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2004/06/02/picayune-rancheria-wins-latest-round-tillie-hardwick-litigation-93618|title=Picayune Rancheria Wins Latest Round of Tillie Hardwick Litigation|work=Indian Country Today Media Network.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hardwick decision restored more terminated tribes than any other single case in California and prompted the majority of the terminated Rancherias to pursue federal restoration.

Of the 46 terminated Rancherias, 31 have been restored; 6 Rancherias are still attempting to restore their federal status.

===Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina Termination Act===
{{main|South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe}}
On September 21, 1959, Congress passed Public Law No. 86-322, 73 Stat. 592 calling for the termination of the [[Catawba people|Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol6/html_files/v6p0890.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Land Management terminated their trust status on July 2, 1960.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

After termination in 1959, the [[Catawba people|Catawba]] nation in South Carolina was determined to fight to regain federal recognition. In 1973, the Catawba filed their petition with the [[United States Congress]] for federal recognition. It was not until 20 years later, November 20, 1993, that the land claim settlement with the state of [[South Carolina]] and the federal government finally came to an end.

Based on the Treaty of Nations Ford of 1840, the Catawba agreed to give up claims on land taken from them by the state of South Carolina. In return, the [[Catawba Indian Nation]] received federal recognition and $50 million for economic development, education, social services, and land purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.catawbaindiannation.com/content.php?title=Catawba%20History |title=Catawba History |access-date=2008-10-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708123519/http://www.catawbaindiannation.com/content.php?title=Catawba%20History |archive-date=2011-07-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 1993, the US Congress enacted Public Law No. 103-116, 107  Stat. 1118, to restore the tribal relationship with the federal government and resolve the land disputes.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=107&amp;page=1118#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ponca Tribe of Nebraska===
On September 5, 1962 Public Law 87–629 76 Stat. 429 was passed terminating the [[Ponca Tribe of Nebraska]].Conditions were similar to other termination agreements, but each tribal member was allotted up to 5 acres of tribal land for personal use as a homesite and the remaining lands were ordered to be sold. One special provision concerned retaining mineral rights to the property by individuals owning at least 25% in the land.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=76&amp;page=429&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Land Management confirmed that the federal trust was terminated on October 27, 1966.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

Fred Leroy, a Ponca and Vietnam veteran, formed the Northern Ponca Restoration Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/nebraska/ponca-tribe-loses-warrior-guardian/article_56c8105b-e551-5a62-aadd-dce261dd1c3f.html|title=Ponca Tribe loses warrior, guardian|author=PETER SALTER / Lincoln Journal Star|work=JournalStar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986–87 and began lobbying the state of Nebraska for recognition. In 1988 the state recognized the tribe and agreed to endorse them for federal restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poncatribe-ne.org/History|title=History|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 1990, the Ponca Restoration Act was passed by Congress and signed by President George H.W. Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/s1747/text|title=Text of S. 1747 (101st): Ponca Restoration Act (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrent with their restoration, the Bureau of Land Management restored the tribal trust lands of 241.84 acres.&lt;ref name="ReferenceF"/&gt;

===Tiwa Indians of Texas (now known as Ysleta del Sur Pueblo)===
On April 12, 1968, under Public Law 90–287 82 Stat. 93 the United States Congress relinquished all responsibility for the [[Ysleta del Sur Pueblo|Tiwa Indians of Ysleta, Texas]] to the State of Texas. The Tiwa Indians Act specified that tribal members would be ineligible for any services, claims or demands from the United States as Indians.&lt;ref name="uscode.house.gov"/&gt;

Public Law 100-89, 101 STAT. 666 was enacted on August 18, 1987, and restored the federal relationship with the tribe simultaneously with those of the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe. The restoration act renamed the tribe to the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo,&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=101&amp;page=666#&lt;/ref&gt; repealed the Tiwa Indians Act, and specifically prohibited all gaming activities prohibited by the laws of the state of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=101&amp;page=668#&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alaskan natives ==
Because [[Alaska]] was not granted statehood until 1959, Native American issues played out differently there. The discovery of oil in the [[Kenai Peninsula]] and [[Cook Inlet]] regions in 1957, and along the [[Alaska North Slope|North Slope]] in 1968, brought the issue of native land ownership to the forefront of a conflict over state land selection.

In 1936, the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) was extended to include the Alaskan natives. As Alaska did not become a state until 1959, the [[Alaskan Natives]] were passed over as termination policy formed in 1953. The fervor for termination faded before Alaskan Natives became subjects of the discussion. Alaskan Natives hurriedly filed land claims with the [[Department of the Interior]] as state land selections and statehood drew closer.

Secretary of the Interior [[Stewart Udall]] was a supporter of the Natives.  In 1966, he issued a freeze on state land selections. In 1969 he issued the Deep Freeze, which declared ninety percent of the state off limits to any form of federal land transfer. One of the main bodies responsible for representing the interests of the Alaskan Natives is the Alaska Federation of Natives. From 1966 to 1971, this group lobbied for a fair land claims settlement act, which resulted in the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA).&lt;ref&gt;Utter, Jack. ''American Indians: Answers to Today's Questions''. 2. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  ANCSA was intended both to provide the state with land promised in gaining statehood and the Natives with a {{convert|40|e6acre|km2|adj=on}} land base.

This act (43 U.S.C. § 1617) was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on December 18, 1971. It revoked previous land claims by the Alaskan natives. Initially, the legislation divided the land into twelve regional (a thirteenth would be added later for natives living outside of the state) and 220 local corporations. U.S. citizens with one-fourth (equivalent to one grandparent) or more Alaska Indian, Eskimo, or Aleut blood living when the Act was passed were considered Native American, and were qualified to participate in receiving dividends from oil production. Natives could register with their village or, if they chose not to enroll with their village, could become "at large" shareholders of the regional corporation. (Note: The [[Tsimshian Indians of the Annette Island Reserve of Metlakatla]] had been granted a reserve from Congress after emigrating from Canada; they were exempt from ANCSA.)

Each registered member of the village corporations received 100 shares of stock in the village corporation. The corporations were granted the {{convert|44|e6acre|km2|adj=on}} land base, or about twelve percent of the state of Alaska. In addition, they received around $962.5 million from both federal and state governments, which was distributed over eleven years. The first five years saw 10% of the money received go to the shareholders of the company, and 45% each to the regional and local corporations. Afterward, half of the money was distributed to the regional corporations and half to the village corporations and "at large" shareholders on a per capita basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litsite.alaska.edu/aktraditions/ancsa.html |title=Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) by Alexandra J. McClanahan |accessdate=2008-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907132246/http://litsite.alaska.edu/aktraditions/ancsa.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response and effects===
The land grant came at a cost. Aboriginal title to the land and aboriginal hunting and fishing rights were extinguished by the act in exchange for fee-simple title to the land and monetary grants to the Native corporations.  Certain aboriginal rights, including subsistence and medical care, were protected under other laws, including the Nelson Act of 1905, the Snyder Act of 1921, the Health Facilities Act of 1957, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Indian Self-Determination Act of 1975, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976. In addition, the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] (ANILCA) protected over {{convert|100|e6acre|km2}} of federal lands in Alaska and the subsistence lifestyle of the Alaskan Natives. This act, passed into law in 1980, doubled the size of the country's national park and refuge system. It created 10 new national parks and increased the area of three existing units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherwonit | first1 = Bill | year = 1998 | title = Teaming Up with Alaska's Natives to Save Land and a Way of Life | url = | journal = Natural Resources Journal | volume = 38 | issue = | page = 85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By enacting this law, the government effectively protected land for the Alaskan Natives to continue subsistence living. These laws indicate that the government does not distinguish between tribal nations and the Alaskan Natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/berger1984/ANRC_Berger.html|title=Berger Launches ANCSA Hearings: Focus on Native Sovereignty, ''Arctic Policy Review''|date=June 1984|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A negative aspect of the ANCSA was that any child born after the passage of the ANCSA could receive no shares under the statute, but could become shareholders by inheritance. Shares could also be inherited by non-Natives, putting the Natives in a difficult position in trying to maintain Native control of the corporations. Shares could also be sold after a 20-year period. Sovereignty was extinguished with the ANCSA and all aboriginal rights were subject to state law.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"/&gt; The village corporations owned only the surface of the selected land. Minerals located below the surface belonged to the regional corporations.

==Politics==
The political climate after World War II based its ideology on building a patriotic, strong, conforming society with all ethnic groups melding together in which free democracy protected American principals of growth through one's own achievement. The Truman administration laid the groundwork for termination, authorizing the [[Indian Claims Commission]] to settle and pay off Indian groups and surveying conditions in Indian country with the Hoover Task Force.  The claims and large expenditures for the survey, coupled with high war debt, led the Eisenhower administration to seek ways to retrench federal budgeting and spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weeks|first1=Philip|title="They Made Us Many Promises": The American Indian Experience 1524 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_NjBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=23 December 2014|pages=199|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempting to grasp what was meant by assimilation into the broader society, understanding the political landscape of the times is important. Assimilation did not mean amalgamation. Cultural diversity was not something to be appreciated, it was a problem that needed to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metcalf|first1=R. Warren|title=Termination's Legacy: The Discarded Indians of Utah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lvBQBOP3icC&amp;lpg|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|accessdate=23 December 2014|pages=34|format=Book|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the United States of "separate but equal". To put the period in historic context, House Concurrent Resolution 108 passed in 1953, [[McCarthyism]] was in full swing and the [[Communist Control Act of 1954]] was designed to keep "collectivism" out of politics. [[Brown v. Board of Education]] was decided in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/case.html|title=Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka :: 347 U.S. 483 (1954) :: Justia U.S. Supreme Court Center|work=Justia Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the US was a decade away from the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Anti-miscegenation laws were predominant (see [[Anti-miscegenation laws in the United States]]) and until the [[Perez v. Sharp]] decision of 1948 and [[Loving v. Virginia]] decision of 1967 racial inter-marriage was banned in over 30 states.

Allotment programs of the previous decades had led to surplus lands being sold by the government to allow white settlement on former reservation lands, creating an attitude that reservations were standing in the way of progress for both native peoples and newly arrived whites. In fact, one of the main architects of the termination policy, Senator [[Arthur V. Watkins]]' parents had expanded their farm by purchasing surplus reservation lands from the Uintah and Ouray Reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metcalf (2002)|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was not just land for settlement; reservations were barriers to the government earning revenues from oil leases, mining leases, timber leases and hydroelectric dams. The perception was that the Indians were under-utilizing their resources and blocking the ability of the government to exploit the environment as a revenue base.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis: Termination of the Grand Ronde (2009)| pp=151–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians from both Democratic and Republican backgrounds supported termination&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeks (2014)|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Metcalf 2002|pp=76–78"&gt;{{harvnb|Metcalf (2002)|pp=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in truth geographic location may have played a much stronger roll in support than party affiliation. A review of the political figures involved shows a preponderance of supporters were from western states with high Indian populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis: Termination of the Grand Ronde (2009)| pp=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, rather than true opposition to termination, the question was whether termination should be unilaterally applied or whether tribal consent should be obtained. Even those who had a real understanding of native peoples and customs, did not question that they would be terminated, but rather how quickly it should be done, how ready they were, whether Congress should immediately or gradually withdraw its trust obligations—in other words to what degree implementation would occur and when.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeks (2014)|pp=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Metcalf 2002|pp=76–78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Termination and Restoration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/termination_and_restoration/#.VJuCuv-oDA|title=Termination and Restoration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The native political positions were a little more clearly in favor or opposition. The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] had had management issues for decades. Poorly trained personnel, inefficiency, corruption, and lack of consistent policy plagued the organization almost from its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downsizinggovernment.org/interior/indian-lands-indian-subsidies|title=Indian Lands, Indian Subsidies,|work=Downsizing the Federal Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some tribes, relief from BIA oversight of policies and funds seemed as if it might pave the way for tribes to maintain their own traditional ways of operating.&lt;ref name="Kidwell (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidwell|first1=Clara Sue|title=The Resurgence of the Choctaws in the Twentieth Century|journal=Indigenous Nations Studies Journal|volume= . 3, No. 1|issue=Spring 2002|pages=10–12|url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/5782/ins.v03.n1.3-18.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/2615/united-states-of-america/native-americans.html|title=Minority Rights Group International : United States of America : Native Americans|publisher=|access-date=2014-12-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226024615/http://www.minorityrights.org/2615/united-states-of-america/native-americans.html|archive-date=2014-12-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clements (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clements|first1=Chris|title=Federal Termination and Its Effects on the Land, Culture, and Identity of the Klamath Indian Tribe|journal=History Department Rutgers|issue=March 2009|url=http://history.rutgers.edu/honors-papers-2009/148-federal-termination-and-its-effects/file|page=41|accessdate=27 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227053848/http://history.rutgers.edu/honors-papers-2009/148-federal-termination-and-its-effects/file|archivedate=27 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Philp (1999)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Philp|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Termination revisited : American Indians on the trail to self-determination, 1933-1953|date=1999|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln [u.a.]|isbn=0-8032-3723-5|pages=171|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68ggiC4QtRkC&amp;lpg|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; But for the vast majority of tribes, termination meant death – an end to sovereignty, an end to communal life, an end to services like healthcare, utilities, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tigerman|first1=Kathleen|title=Wisconsin Indian Literature: Anthology of Native Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BTnBMOERCOUC&amp;lpg|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|accessdate=26 December 2014|pages=34–36|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative figures===
Some of the major supporters of the termination movement included political appointees, which clearly illustrate that support was not particularly partisan. Truman's appointee as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, [[Dillon S. Myer]], was a hard-line "Terminationist" as well as an advocate of complete assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeks (2014)|pp=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in implementing the [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956|relocation]] program, Myer targeted school programs mainstreaming mixed-bloods into public schools and allowing only full-bloods to attend reservation schools, forbidding education on Indian cultures.&lt;ref name="Parman (1994)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parman|first1=Donald Lee|title=Indians and the American West in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKOP0UHqOEkC&amp;lpg|publisher=Indiana University Press|accessdate=26 December 2014|page=132|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myers' militaristic style&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Philip (2002)|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in calls for his replacement when Eisenhower was elected, culminating in the appointment of [[Glenn L. Emmons]]. Emmons had lived and worked among New Mexico's Indians and while he favored termination, he was a "Protectionist", believing that with a gradual withdrawal of government assistance, native peoples would learn to be self-sufficient. He opposed programs that exploited native vulnerability and failed to take their wishes into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeks (2014)|pp=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Truman's first Secretary of the Interior [[Julius Krug]] forsook his obligation to preserve Alaskan natives' rights to the [[Tongass National Forest]]. It was widely believed that he had relinquished responsibility to protect the Alaskan natives in favor of corporate timber interests. Though urged to stop passage of the [[Tongass Timber Bill]] and set aside reservation lands, instead the bill was passed (Public Law 385) in 1947. The following year, Krug prepared the ''Krug Indian Land Confiscation Bill'' to put an end to all native land claims in Alaska, but was forced to abandon the measure due to opposition shortly before he resigned.&lt;ref name="Cowger (2001)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cowger|first1=Thomas W.|title=The National Congress of American Indians: The Founding Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlcxF5HkXPQC&amp;lpg|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|accessdate=December 26, 2014|pages=59–62|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krug was replaced by [[Oscar L.

The ranks of "Protectionist" elected officials—who felt that the Tribes should be consulted, policies should move slowly, and termination should occur only when Indians were ready—were small, but powerful.

The Amendment was supposed to simplify Indian water rights by waiving, on a limited basis, the U.S. sovereign immunity for state litigation involving water.  Since Native rights are held in the name of the U.S., the Supreme Court ruled in 1971 in the US v. District Court for the County of Eagle and US v. District Court for Water Division No. 5, that their rights are usage rights and not legal title; thus, states can determine whether tribal rights apply or not.&lt;ref name="Deloria (2001)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deloria Jr.|first1=Vine|last2=Wilkins|first2=David E.|title=Tribes, treaties, and constitutional tribulations|date=2001|publisher=University of Texas press|location=Austin|isbn=0-292-71608-7|page=131|edition=1.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBVlwohq6QgC&amp;lpg|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl E.

===Tribal figures===
[[File:Ada Deer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ada Deer]] was not in favor of termination.]]
Several tribal leaders played important roles in the process of termination, including [[Choctaw]] Chief [[Harry J. W. Belvin]]. Belvin lobbied heavily for [[Choctaw]] termination, which contributed to the tribe's being one of more than 100 scheduled for termination. The effective date of the policy was pushed back three times, and the termination law was repealed in 1970, after another change in policy. Many of the younger members of the Choctaw tribe opposed termination and got Belvin's attention. By 1970, Belvin had turned from supporting termination to advocating its repeal.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Valerie. ''Political Protest, Conflict, and Tribal Nationalism: The Oklahoma Choctaws and the Termination Crisis of 1959–1970''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ada Deer]] was instrumental in reversing termination. She was a leader in regaining tribal status for the [[Menominee]] tribe. Deer and other [[Menominee]] leaders believed that "only repeal of the termination act, return of the land to its trust status, and full recognition of the tribe and its sovereign authority could right the wrongs against their people and their land".&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"/&gt; Ada Deer faced strong opposition from House Interior Committee chairman [[Wayne Aspinall]], who had been a long-time supporter of termination. The Menominee bill to reverse termination had to go through his committee. Deer's work paid off when Aspinall was upset in the [[Colorado]] Democratic primary in 1972, and thus lost his committee chair.

In 1973, Congressmen [[Lloyd Meeds]] and [[Manuel Lujan]] held House field hearings. The [[Menominee Restoration Act]] moved quickly through Congress, and President [[Richard Nixon]] signed it into law December 1973. In 1975, the restoration was complete when Secretary of the Interior [[Rogers Morton]] held a ceremony in which he signed the documents that dissolved Menominee Enterprises, Incorporated. He gave all Menominee lands back to the tribe. Ada Deer's work to reverse Menominee termination was successful.&lt;ref name="bloodstruggle"/&gt;

James White worked alongside Ada Deer to help bring about the reversal of termination. White helped found the organization known as Determination of Rights and Unity for Menominee Stockholders (DRUMS) in 1970. Members of DRUMS strongly protested the development of the [[Legend Lake]] project and put up their own candidates for election to Menominee Enterprises, Inc. board of directors. DRUMS succeeded in blocking the planned Legend Lake development and controlled most of the board of MEI by 1972. In addition, White's work with DRUMS helped bring about the reversal of Menominee termination.&lt;ref name="milwaukee_menominee"/&gt;

[[Tillie Hardwick]] was a Pomo Indian woman who was instrumental in reversing the California Indian Rancheria termination policy of the U.S. government. She filed suit on behalf of the [[Pinoleville Pomo Nation|Pinoleville Indian Rancheria]] in 1979 which was modified into a class action lawsuit in 1982. The case, ''Tillie Hardwick, et al. v. United States of America, et al.'' Case #C-79-1710-SW (often cited as Hardwick I) confirmed, as of December 22, 1983, that 17 of the California Rancherias had been wrongfully terminated and reaffirmed their recognition by the federal government. As many of the tribes involved had lost their lands to private parties, an amended Hardwick case was filed in 1986 (often cited as Hardwick II) to partially restore land claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standupca.org/off-reservation-gaming/federal-acknowledgement-process/tribal-groups-in-active-status/nevada-city-rancheria/1-20-10%20Complaint.pdf/view|title=1-20-10 Complaint.pdf|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hardwick case affected more tribes than any other case in California and became precedent not only for additional wrongful termination cases, but is cited in nearly every gaming decision for the California tribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ledger-dispatch.com/news/a-look-at-buena-vista-an-th83-8212-guest-commentary-by-butch-cranfordp{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Osceola]] (June 30, 1919 – April 16, 1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-04-18/news/9504180379_1_james-henry-florence-arnold-pompano-beach/3|title=Paid Obituaries|work=Sun Sentinel}}&lt;/ref&gt; participated in both the March 1–2, 1954 and April 6– 7, 1955 Congressional hearings on the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]]. On April 4, 1955, when the tribe created a board of directors to organize the tribe, he was appointed chairman. Lacking the necessary funds to make repeated trips to Washington, DC and Tallahassee, Florida to argue their case, Osceola came up with a plan to build a rodeo arena on the Dania Reservation as a tourist attraction. He convinced cattlemen in Brighton to commit cattle and got lumber donations from people in Broward County. Opening day at the Rodeo saw 500 spectators and proceeds were used to organize the tribe and gain federal recognition.&lt;ref name="semtribe.com"/&gt; The rodeo that Osceola began in an effort to save his tribe was christened on February 7, 1997 as the Bill Osceola Memorial Rodeo, to honor his memory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-3635297.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1954 in hearings before the joint Senate and House Subcommittees on Indian Affairs in Washington DC, two delegations from Kansas were successfully able to thwart termination attempts against the Kansas Tribes.

==Effects==
During 1953&amp;ndash;1964, more than 100 tribes were terminated, approximately {{convert|1365801|acre|km2|0}} of trust land were removed from protected status, and 13,263 Native Americans lost tribal affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of termination, the special federal trustee relationship of the Indians with the federal government ended, they were subjected to state laws, and their lands were converted to private ownership.&lt;ref name="cowcreek_termination"/&gt;

The tribes disapproved of Public Law 280, as they disliked states having jurisdiction without tribal consent. The State governments also disapproved of the law, as they did not want to take on jurisdiction for additional areas without additional funding. Consequently, additional amendments to Public Law 280 were passed to require tribal consent in law enforcement.&lt;ref name="nrcprograms_policy"/&gt; On May 3, 1958, the Inter Tribal Council of California (ITCC) was founded in response to the pressures of termination and other issues.

Many scholars believe that the termination policy had devastating effects on tribal autonomy, culture and economic welfare.&lt;ref name="milwaukee_menominee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="walch_terminating"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lands belonging to the Native Americans, rich in resources, were taken over by the federal government. The termination policy had disastrous effects on the [[Menominee]] tribe (located in [[Wisconsin]]) and the [[Klamath people|Klamath]] tribes (located in [[Oregon]]), forcing many members of the tribes onto the public assistance roll.

Termination had a devastating effect on the health care and education of Indians along with the economic stability of tribes. Along with the end of federal control over land came the end of many federal services which included education and health care.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt;

=== Education ===
By 1972, termination clearly had affected the tribes' education. There was a 75% dropout rate for the Menominee Tribe, which resulted in a generation of Menominee children who had only a ninth grade education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Peroff|Peroff, Nicholas C.]], ''Menominee Drums'', University of Oklahoma Press, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-8061-3777-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribes lost federal support for their schools, and the states were expected to assume the role of educating the Indian children.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Reyhner and Jeanne Eder American Indian Education&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Menominee]] children, for example, did not have their own tribal schools any more and were discriminated against within the public schools. The Menominee education program became a part of Joint School District No. 8.  Younger children were still able to attend schools close to their homes, but high school students had to travel to either [[Gresham, Wisconsin]], or [[Shawano, Wisconsin|Shawano]] for schooling.&lt;ref name="Ourada"&gt;Ourada, Patricia K., ''The Menominee Indians: A History'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; All terminated tribes faced new education policies, which gave the children fewer educational opportunities that were not as good as what the whites received.

The idea of termination was to restore complete sovereignty to the United States, and to encourage assimilation into a modern, individualistic society, rather than a savage tribal mentality. In 1966 the [[Keshena]] and [[Neopit]] 3rd and 6th graders' success on the Iowa Test for basic skills was compared to the rest of their school district (Joint School District No. 8). The school district had a composite grade for the 3rd and 6th graders of 82% and 60%, respectively.  However, the two schools composed mostly of Indian students had drastically lower scores.  Keshena's scores on this same test were about 13% for the 3rd graders and 17% for the 6th graders, while Neopit's were 15% for the 3rd graders and 8% for the 6th graders.  From these test scores, it can be seen that education was not improved when termination occurred and the Indians' level of education was nowhere near that of whites in the area.&lt;ref name="93rdCongress"&gt;''Menominee Restoration Act'' Hearings before the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs House of Representatives, 93rd Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminated tribal children struggled to stay in school, and those who did were excluded from programs that paid for higher Indian education. In 1970 the BIA began to make annual grants that gave scholarships to Indians to attend college. This helped the non-terminated tribes, but individuals within terminated tribes were not allowed to apply for these funds. As a result, individuals who were successful and managed to graduate from high school had trouble going to college because they could not apply for scholarship assistance.&lt;ref name="ReportIPRC"&gt;''Report on Terminated and Nonfederally Recognized Indians'', American Indian Policy Review Commission&lt;!--publication year, place?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care ===
The [[Indian Health Service]] provided health care for many Indian tribes, but once a tribe was terminated all tribe members lost their eligibility.&lt;ref name="Canby" /&gt; Many no longer had easy access to hospitals and had no means to get health care. For example, the [[Menominee]] people had no tribal hospitals or clinics. The tribal hospital at [[Keshena]] had to close because it did not meet state standards, and the lack of funds available prevented the county from making improvements. Along with the hospital, the tribal clinic was also closed after termination occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Venables, Robert W. ''American Indian History  Five Centuries of Conflict and Coexistence'' (Clear Light Publishers, 2004) {{ISBN|978-1-57416-076-5}}, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;  When there was a tuberculosis epidemic, 25% of the people were affected and had no means to get treatment because there was no longer a hospital or a clinic.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wilkinson&lt;!--which source? There are two by Charles --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The health standards of Indians fell well below those of whites.  The Menominee tribe had three times the infant mortality rate as the rest of the state. Dental care was also affected by termination; ninety percent of school age children in the Menominee tribe were in need of dental care, which was no longer provided as a free service since they did not have tribal status.&lt;ref name="Ourada" /&gt; The Western Oregon tribes who were terminated, much like the Menominee tribe, also felt the effects of termination on their health care services. In a 1976 survey, 75% of the Indians in Western Oregon reported needing dental care and 30% were in need of eyeglasses. In addition to affecting adults, schools also reported that the primary problem for Indian children was the need of medical treatment that their parents could not afford.&lt;ref name="ReportIPRC" /&gt;

Many Indians relocated off the reservations during termination and also had no access to health care. When they relocated they were given private health care for six months, but then they had none unless they were close to a city with an Indian health care facility. Eventually the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] could not provide necessary health services for the many tribes that were terminated, and Congress began reform the Indian health care policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.gov/Urban/index.cfm?module=dsp_urban_about History of Urban Indian Health Programs], U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services. Retrieved on 2009-05-11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the Indian Health Service was transferred from the administration of the BIA to the [[Public Health Service]], which resulted in an almost immediate improvement in funding, training and services. By 1964 the reforms were leading to progress, as Indian life expectancy rose from 51 years in 1940 to 63.5 years.&lt;ref name="Sturtevant (1988)"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sturtevant|editor1-first=William C.|title=Handbook of North American Indians: History of Indian-White relations, Vol. 4|date=1988|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|isbn=0-16-004583-5|lccn=77017162|pages=77–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQRpEgEzYd4C&amp;lpg|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
Termination, although not the only cause of Indian poverty, had a significant effect on it. The Menominee tribe proves a strong example of this; although the economy of the Menominee tribe had never flourished, it became even worse after the tribe was terminated. Prior to termination, Menominee income centered around the mill which was built on a community philosophy and tried to employ as many individuals as possible. After termination the mill was run as a business and unemployment rose to between 18 and 28 percent. The mill did generate increased net sales, however; $4,865,000 in 1973 compared to $1,660,700 in 1961. Despite higher sales, the mill's net loss was also much higher in 1973 ($709,000 compared with only a net loss of $108,700 in 1961); this was largely due to the mill's property taxes increasing from $164,000 in 1961 to $607,300 in 1973.&lt;ref name="93rdCongress" /&gt; With no new industry and the new taxes being introduced, 80 percent of the tribal population fell below the poverty line. In the 1960s, they were forced to sell ancestral land and went from having $10 million in a federal reserve to being considered a "pocket of poverty". Welfare costs within the county also increased during the period of termination. In 1963, tribal members were given a total of $49,723 for welfare, but by 1968 the amount had nearly doubled. As termination continued, the struggles only became worse for the tribe.&lt;ref name="Ourada" /&gt;

As termination continued, the unemployment rates continued to increase. The Menominee tribe had 800 individuals within the tribe and 220 individuals who were unemployed in June 1968.  By June 1973, right before the termination policy ended, the tribe had almost a 40 percent unemployment rate, with only 660 individuals in the tribe and 260 individuals who were unemployed.&lt;ref name="93rdCongress" /&gt;

The Menominee Indians experienced high poverty rates from the very beginning of termination, unlike the Klamath Tribe which was able to escape poverty for a brief period.  The Klamath tribe had for years been living off timber and revenue from leasing tribal lands. When termination occurred, tribal land was sold and most of the Klamath tribe was considered above the poverty line, because each tribal member gained $40,000 from the sale. While they had escaped poverty briefly, their economy still suffered from termination.  Most families quickly spent the money earned from the initial land sale and were forced to sell more land in order obtain food for the family. After just a few years, the Klamath tribe was in the same situation as many other tribes that were terminated.&lt;ref name="ReportIPRC" /&gt;

{{Politics of Mexico}}

The '''Instituto Nacional Electoral''' ('''INE''') (English  for ''National Electoral Institute'') (formerly '''Federal Electoral Institute''' ({{lang|es|Instituto Federal Electoral}}, '''IFE''')) is an autonomous, public organization responsible for organizing federal elections in [[Mexico]], that is, those related to the election of the [[president of Mexico|President]] of the [[Mexico|United Mexican States]] and to the election of the members of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Lower]] and [[Senate of the Republic (Mexico)|Upper]] chambers that constitute the [[Congress of the Union]]. The organization's president is {{lang|es|[[Lorenzo Córdova Vianello]]|italic=no}}.

==History==
===1990–2014===
[[File:IFE logo.gif|thumb|150px|IFE former logo, used from 1990 to 2014]]
The IFE was formally established on October 11, 1990, as a result of a series of constitutional reforms approved in 1989 and the Federal Code of Electoral Institutions and Procedures (Cofipe), a law passed in August 1990 and currently in force. The legislative branch of the federal government, the national [[List of political parties in Mexico|political parties]], and the general citizenry participate in its composition. 

Since its creation, the constitutional and legal regulations in this subject matter have experienced further major reforms, which have affected the composition and details of the IFE. The most recent of these reforms, approved in 1996, reinforced the level of independence and autonomy of the IFE by completely dissociating the executive branch from any aspect regarding its membership or functions, and by reserving the vote within all its directive bodies to the councilors, the members that do not have links to any party or to any state power or body. 

IFE had legal personnel and assets of its own.  Its headquarters were located in the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]], and it was organized under a decentralized framework that allowed it to exercise its duties throughout the country.

As a result of electoral reforms initiated by President [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], the IFE was dissolved on April 4, 2014, and was supplanted by the National Electoral Institute ({{lang-es|Instituto Nacional Electoral}}, INE).

==Political parties and associations==
IFE was also charged with the registration, funding and oversight of national political parties (as opposed to local political parties, which are registered by each [[States of Mexico|state's]] Electoral Institute). Rules and guidelines for the registration of national political parties are outlined in the Federal Code of Electoral Institutions and Procedures.

In addition, IFE could register [[national political association]]s, which are intended to assist in the development of democratic life and the country's political culture, as well as being intended to create a better informed public opinion. The creation of a national political association is usually regarded as the first step towards the creation of a full-fledged political party.

==Professional Electoral Service==
In order to guarantee a professional and specialized performance of its responsibilities, the IFE used a special system of recruitment, selection, training, and evaluation of qualified staff to provide electoral services, especially in its fundamental areas, which are the ones directly linked with the preparation and organization of elections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3062">[[File:Light clay infill.JPG|thumb|Example use of light clay within a timber frame before rendering]]'''Light clay''' (also '''light straw clay''', '''light clay straw''', '''slipstraw''') is a natural building material used to infill between a wooden frame in a [[timber framing|timber framed]] building using a combination of [[clay]] and [[straw]], [[woodchips]] or some other lighter material.

==History==
A mixture of clay and straw was used as an infill material for [[timber framing|timber framed]] building from at least the 12th century in Germany and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/clay.html|title=An Introduction to Traditional and Modern German Clay Building|quote=Building with clay has a long tradition in Germany and other European countries. Framed structures (half-timbered houses) from the 12th century, filled with a mixture of clay and straw fibers, still exist.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renewed interest in traditional building methods developed from the 1980s after which various [[natural building]] architects and builders started promoting the use of light clay.&lt;ref name=art&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=054_i8KdcCAC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=%22light+clay%22+natural&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4VzMTspw_L&amp;sig=QrHVmnQrZZJNMYHs0fG7N6Lr6K8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Izy8TaLtJ5CwhQetk8HRBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22light%20clay%22%20natural&amp;f=false|title=The art of natural building: design, construction, resources|pages=165–170|isbn=978-0-86571-433-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Light clay mix.JPG|thumb|right|Light clay mixture consisting of clay, water and straw before application]]
Local clay, often local subsoil, is mixed into a slurry with water and then combined with straw or wood chip or other similar material. Wood chips can vary in size from [[sawdust]] to chip 5cm in diameter.&lt;ref name=art/&gt; The ratio of clay to other ingredients can be adapted to either increase thermal mass or insulation properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=light+clay+natural&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SvmhvLrYCH&amp;sig=PJh5g60hsMTPX0MrxqqmK-lATBY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0z-8Ta2KOMOLhQfa0dTJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=light%20clay%20natural&amp;f=false|title=The natural house: a complete guide to healthy, energy-efficient|page=250|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture is provided with additional structural strength using [[Wattle and daub|wattles]].

King [[Charles III of Spain]] tried in 1764 to bring back a law of 1734 by his father King [[Philip V of Spain]] whereby even thieves operating in Madrid could be tried and executed even if no murder was involved in the thieving. The royal council pointed out to him that either victims or witnesses would default collaboration with Justice by the general popular feeling that the punishment could be disproportionate with people robbing only money, jewels, etc. while saving the lives of the persons being robbed. The King was thus obliged to keep his ideas on public order to himself and/or educated listeners.

Further, lawyer Acevedo published in 1770 a dissertation against torture, as being in conflict with Nature Rights and public decency within the Social Body. The lawyer politician from [[Zaragoza]], [[Manuel de Roda]] y Arrieta, managed to get Charles III and his Royal Council deliberating around changes into the Penal Legislation, whereby capital punishment and/or extensive terms rotting in prisons could better be modified to convicts performing useful works needed by the public interest.

These moves, prior to 1776, where the king and his royal council echoed letters of intent dated 1776 through reflections on the significant works by [[Cesare Beccaria]], brought about the publication in 1782 by Manuel de Lardizábal of his ''Discurso sobre las penas contrahido a las leyes criminales de España para facilitar su reforma''. He cites Frenchman [[Montesquieu]], [[Guillaume-François Le Trosne]], with his ''Réflexions sur la réforme de la legislation universelle'',&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Guillaume-François Le Trosne]]&lt;/ref&gt; the German [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], the Dutch [[Hugo Grotius]], the Italian Beccaria, and the reflections on the degradation applying torture of the Frenchman [[Joseph Michel Antoine Servan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1279">'''Senate Bill 1752''', more commonly known as the '''Military Justice Improvement Act''' ('''MJIA'''), was introduced by U.S. Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] (D-N.Y.) in 2013 as an attempt to reform procedures for determinations to proceed to trial by court-martial for certain offenses under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] and for other purposes. The focus of the bill is to address the way that [[sexual assault in the United States military]] is handled through the military justice system and the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. 1752 - Military Justice Improvement Act of 2013|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1752/text|publisher=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill has been criticized as potentially leading to a decrease in sexual assault prosecutions and in the protections offered to alleged victims of sexual assault. [https://www.dailysignal.com/2015/06/11/how-gillibrands-military-sexual-assault-legislation-could-hurt-victims/]. Many support an alternative bill championed by Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri.

The '''Ministry of Justice of Armenia''' (''Հայաստանի արդարադատության նախարարություն'') is an Armenian government agency which possesses executive authority and executes policies of the [[Government of Armenia]] in sectors that are closely associated with laws and regulations. The ministry oversees the operations of the following agencies:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.am/en/structure/3/|title=Government - Structure - The Government of the Republic of Armenia|last=LLC|first=Helix Consulting|date=|website=www.gov.am|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry was founded in 1920 under the government of the newly formed [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

== History ==
In 1920, the Revolutionary Committee of the Armenian SSR founded the People's Commissariat of Justice, which began to control the Armenian prosecutor's office in December 1923. The Communist Party of Armenia was in-active from 1930 to 1933, of which during those three years, the justice system of [[Armenia]] was administered by the [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Supreme Court of the USSR]]. In 1936, the prosecutor's office and the investigative bodies were separated from the People's Court of Justice, and the People's Commissariat was reorganized into the Ministry of Justice. It operated until 1959, when it's functions were exercised by the Supreme Court until the 1970s. By ordee of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of November 2, 1970, the Ministry of Justice of the Armenian SSR was reestablished and became the precursor to the Ministry of Justice of Armenia which was founded in 1991, following the USSR's demise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26528">'''Modbus''' is a serial [[communications protocol]] originally published by [[Programmable_logic_controller#Invention_and_early_development|Modicon]] (now [[Schneider Electric]]) in 1979 for use with its [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). Modbus has become a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Standardization|standard]] communication protocol and is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial [[Electronics|electronic]] devices.&lt;ref name=Drury2009&gt;{{cite book |first=Bill |last=Drury |title=Control Techniques Drives and Controls Handbook |edition=2nd |date=2009 |publisher=[[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] |url=http://knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=2995&amp;VerticalID=0 |format=PDF |pages=508– |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reasons for the use of Modbus in the industrial environment are:
* developed with industrial applications in mind,
* openly published and royalty-free,
* easy to deploy and maintain,
* moves raw bits or words without placing many restrictions on vendors.

Modbus enables communication among many devices connected to the same network, for example, a system that measures temperature and humidity and communicates the results to a [[computer]]. Modbus is often used to connect a supervisory computer with a [[remote terminal unit]] (RTU) in supervisory control and data acquisition ([[SCADA]]) systems. Many of the data types are named from industry usage of [[Ladder logic]] and its use in driving relays: a single-bit physical output is called a ''coil'', and a single-bit physical input is called a ''discrete input'' or a ''contact''.

The development and update of Modbus protocols has been managed by the Modbus Organization&lt;ref name="Modbus home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modbus.org/ |title=Modbus home page |website=Modbus |publisher=Modbus Organization, Inc. |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; since April 2004, when Schneider Electric transferred rights to that organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modbus.org/faq.php |title=Modbus FAQ |website=Modbus |publisher=Modbus Organization, Inc. |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Modbus Organization is an association of users and suppliers of Modbus-compliant devices that advocates for the continued use of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modbus.org/about_us.php |title=About Modbus Organization |website=Modbus |publisher=Modbus Organization, Inc. |accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modbus object types ==

The following is a table of object types provided by a Modbus slave device to a Modbus master device:
{| class="wikitable"
! Object type
! Access
! Size
|-
| Coil
| Read-write
| 1 bit
|-
| Discrete input
| Read-only
| 1 bit
|-
| Input register
| Read-only
| 16 bits
|-
| Holding register
| Read-write
| 16 bits
|}

== Protocol versions ==
Versions of the Modbus protocol exist for [[serial port]] and for [[Ethernet]] and other protocols that support the [[Internet protocol suite]]. There are many variants of Modbus protocols:
* ''Modbus RTU'' — This is used in serial communication and makes use of a compact, binary representation of the data for protocol communication. The RTU format follows the commands/data with a [[cyclic redundancy check]] checksum as an error check mechanism to ensure the reliability of data. Modbus RTU is the most common implementation available for Modbus. A Modbus RTU message must be transmitted continuously without inter-character hesitations. Modbus messages are framed (separated) by idle (silent) periods.
* ''Modbus ASCII'' — This is used in serial communication and makes use of [[ASCII]] characters for protocol communication. The ASCII format uses a [[longitudinal redundancy check]] checksum. Modbus ASCII messages are framed by leading colon (":") and trailing newline (CR/LF).
* ''Modbus TCP/IP or Modbus TCP'' — This is a Modbus variant used for communications over [[TCP/IP]] networks, connecting over port 502.&lt;ref name=modbustcp&gt;{{citation| title=Modbus Messaging on TCP/IP Implementation Guide V1.0b| url=http://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Messaging_Implementation_Guide_V1_0b.pdf| publisher=Modbus Organization, Inc.| date=October 24, 2006| access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not require a checksum calculation, as lower layers already provide checksum protection.
* ''Modbus over TCP/IP or Modbus over TCP or Modbus RTU/IP'' — This is a Modbus variant that differs from Modbus TCP in that a checksum is included in the payload as with Modbus RTU.
* ''Modbus over UDP'' — Some have experimented with using Modbus over [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] on IP networks, which removes the overheads required for [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jamod.sourceforge.net| title=Java Modbus Library - About| year=2010| access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Modbus Plus (Modbus+, MB+ or MBP)'' — Modbus Plus is proprietary to [[Schneider Electric]] and unlike the other variants, it supports [[peer-to-peer]] communications between multiple masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.schneider-electric.ca/en/faqs/FA198221/| title=What is the difference between Modbus and Modbus Plus?| publisher=Schneider Electric| access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires a dedicated co-processor to handle fast [[High-Level Data Link Control|HDLC]]-like token rotation. It uses twisted pair at 1&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s and includes transformer isolation at each node, which makes it transition/edge-triggered instead of voltage/level-triggered. Special hardware is required to connect Modbus Plus to a computer, typically a card made for the [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]], [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] or [[PC Card|PCMCIA]] bus.
* ''Pemex Modbus'' — This is an extension of standard Modbus with support for historical and flow data. It was designed for the [[Pemex]] oil and gas company for use in process control and never gained widespread adoption.
* ''Enron Modbus'' — This is another extension of standard Modbus developed by [[Enron Corporation]] with support for 32-bit integer and floating-point variables and historical and flow data. Data types are mapped using standard addresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.simplymodbus.ca/Enron.htm| title=Simply Modbus - About Enron Modbus| publisher=Simply Modbus |access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical data serves to meet an [[American Petroleum Institute]] (API) industry standard for how data should be stored.{{Citation needed| date=January 2017}}

Data model and function calls are identical for the first 4 variants of protocols; only the encapsulation is different. However the variants are not interoperable, nor are the frame formats.

== Communication and devices ==
Each device intended to communicate using Modbus is given a unique address. In serial and MB+ networks, only the node assigned as the Master may initiate a command. On Ethernet, any device can send out a Modbus command, although usually only one master device does so. A Modbus command contains the Modbus address of the device it is intended for (1 to 247). Only the intended device will act on the command, even though other devices might receive it (an exception is specific broadcastable commands sent to node 0, which are acted on but not acknowledged). All Modbus commands contain checksum information to allow the recipient to detect transmission errors. The basic Modbus commands can instruct an RTU to change the value in one of its registers, control or read an I/O port, and command the device to send back one or more values contained in its registers.

There are many modems and gateways that support Modbus, as it is a very simple and often copied protocol. Some of them were specifically designed for this protocol. Different implementations use wireline, wireless communication, such as in the [[ISM band]], and even [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) or [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS). One of the more common designs of wireless networks makes use of [[mesh networking]]. Typical problems that designers have to overcome include high latency and timing issues.

== Frame format ==
A Modbus frame is composed of an Application Data Unit (ADU), which encloses a Protocol Data Unit (PDU):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modbus Messaging On TCP/IP Implementation Guide|url=http://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Messaging_Implementation_Guide_V1_0b.pdf|website=Modbus Organization|publisher=Modbus-IDA|ref=MobusTCPSpec}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ADU = Address + PDU + Error check,
* PDU = Function code + Data.
All Modbus variants choose one of the following frame formats.&lt;ref name=Drury2009 /&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="float:middle; margin:0 0 1em 1em;"

* Initial value: 65,535.
* Example of frame in hexadecimal: &lt;code&gt;01 04 02 FF FF B8 80&lt;/code&gt; (CRC-16-ANSI calculation from &lt;code&gt;01&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;FF&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;80B8&lt;/code&gt;, which is transmitted '''least''' significant byte '''first''').

|}
Address, function, data, and LRC are all capital hexadecimal readable pairs of characters representing 8-bit values (0–255). For example, 122 (7 × 16 + 10) will be represented as &lt;code&gt;7A&lt;/code&gt;.

LRC is calculated as the sum of 8-bit values, negated ([[two's complement]]) and encoded as an 8-bit value. Example: if address, function, and data encode as 247, 3, 19, 137, 0, and 10, their sum is 416. Two's complement (−416) trimmed to 8&amp;nbsp;bits is 96 (e.g. 256 × 2 − 416), which will be represented as &lt;code&gt;60&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal. Hence the following frame: &lt;code&gt;:F7031389000A60&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Unit identifier is used with Modbus/TCP devices that are composites of several Modbus devices, e.g. on Modbus/TCP to Modbus RTU gateways. In such case, the unit identifier tells the Slave Address of the device behind the gateway. Natively Modbus/TCP-capable devices usually ignore the Unit Identifier.

The byte order for values in Modbus data frames is [[Endianness|big-endian]] (MSB, most significant byte of a value received first).

== Supported function codes ==
The various reading, writing and other operations are categorised as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b3.pdf |format=PDF |title=Modbus Application Protocol V1.1b3 |website=Modbus |publisher=Modbus Organization, Inc. |accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most primitive reads and writes are shown in bold. A number of sources use alternative terminology, for example ''Force Single Coil'' where the standard uses ''Write Single Coil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gordon |last=Clarke |first2=Deon |last2=Reynders |title=Practical Modern Scada Protocols: Dnp3, 60870.5 and Related Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENqyW8fExswC&amp;pg=PA45 |publisher=Newnes |date=2004 |isbn=0-7506-5799-5 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Prominent entities within a Modbus slave are:
* Coils: readable and writable, 1 bit (off/on)
* Discrete Inputs: readable, 1 bit (off/on)
* Input Registers: readable, 16 bits (0 to 65,535), essentially measurements and statuses
* Holding Registers: readable and writable, 16 bits (0 to 65,535), essentially configuration values

== Format of data of requests and responses for main function codes ==
Requests and responses follow frame formats described above. This section gives details of data formats of most used function codes.

=== Function code 1 (read coils) and function code 2 (read discrete inputs) ===
'''Request''':
*Address of first coil/discrete input to read (16-bit)
*Number of coils/discrete inputs to read (16-bit)

'''Normal response''':
*Number of bytes of coil/discrete input values to follow (8-bit)
*Coil/discrete input values (8 coils/discrete inputs per byte)

Value of each coil/discrete input is binary (0 for off, 1 for on). First requested coil/discrete input is stored as least significant bit of first byte in reply.&lt;br&gt;
If number of coils/discrete inputs is not a multiple of 8, most significant bit(s) of last byte will be stuffed with zeros.&lt;br&gt;
For example, if eleven coils are requested, two bytes of values are needed. Suppose states of those successive coils are ''on, off, on, off, off, on, on, on, off, on, on'', then the response will be &lt;code&gt;02 E5 06&lt;/code&gt; in hexadecimal.

Because the byte count returned in the reply message is only 8 bits wide and the protocol overhead is 5 bytes, a maximum of 2000 (250 x 8) discrete inputs or coils can be read at once.

=== Function code 5 (force/write single coil) ===
'''Request''':
*Address of coil (16-bit)
*Value to force/write: 0 for off and 65,280 (FF00 in hexadecimal) for on
'''Normal response''': same as request.

=== Function code 15 (force/write multiple coils) ===
'''Request''':
*Address of first coil to force/write (16-bit)
*Number of coils to force/write (16-bit)
*Number of bytes of coil values to follow (8-bit)
*Coil values (8 coil values per byte)
Value of each coil is binary (0 for off, 1 for on). First requested coil is stored as least significant bit of first byte in request.&lt;br&gt;
If number of coils is not a multiple of 8, most significant bit(s) of last byte should be stuffed with zeros. See example for function codes 1 and 2.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Normal response''':
*Address of first coil (16-bit)
*number of coils (16-bit)

=== Function code 4 (read input registers) and function code 3 (read holding registers) ===
'''Request''':
*Address of first register to read (16-bit)
*Number of registers to read (16-bit)
'''Normal response''':
*Number of bytes of register values to follow (8-bit)
*Register values (16 bits per register)
Because the number of bytes for register values is 8-bit wide, only 125 registers can be read at once.&lt;ref&gt;http://modbus.org/docs/PI_MBUS_300.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Function code 6 (preset/write single holding register) ===
'''Request''':
*Address of holding register to preset/write (16-bit)
*New value of the holding register (16-bit)
'''Normal response''': same as request.

=== Function code 16 (preset/write multiple holding registers) ===
'''Request''':
*Address of first holding register to preset/write (16-bit)
*Number of holding registers to preset/write (16-bit)
*Number of bytes of register values to follow (8-bit)
*New values of holding registers (16 bits per register)
Because register values are 2-bytes wide and only 127 bytes worth of values can be sent, only 63 holding registers can be preset/written at once.

'''Normal response''':
*Address of first preset/written holding register (16-bit)
*number of preset/written holding registers (16-bit)

=== Exception responses ===
For a normal response, slave repeats the function code. Should a slave want to report an error, it will reply with the requested function code plus 128 (hex &lt;code&gt;0x80&lt;/code&gt;) (3 becomes 131 = hex &lt;code&gt;0x83&lt;/code&gt;), and will only include one byte of data, known as the ''exception code''.

=== Main Modbus exception codes ===

|}

== Coil, discrete input, input register, holding register numbers and addresses ==
Some conventions govern how access to Modbus entities (coils, discrete inputs, input registers, holding registers) are referenced.

It is important to make a distinction between entity ''number'' and entity ''address'':
* Entity ''numbers'' combine entity type and entity location within their description table.
* Entity ''address'' is the starting address, a 16-bit value in the data part of the Modbus frame. As such its range goes from 0 to 65,535

In the traditional standard, ''numbers'' for those entities start with a digit, followed by a number of 4 digits in the range 1–9,999:
* coils ''numbers'' start with '''0''' and span from '''0'''0001 to '''0'''9999,
* discrete input ''numbers'' start with '''1''' and span from '''1'''0001 to '''1'''9999,
* input register ''numbers'' start with '''3''' and span from '''3'''0001 to '''3'''9999,
* holding register ''numbers'' start with '''4''' and span from '''4'''0001 to '''4'''9999.
This translates into ''addresses'' between 0 and 9,998 in data frames.
For example, in order to read holding registers starting at ''number'' 40001, corresponding ''address'' in the data frame will be 0 with a function code of 3 (as seen above). For holding registers starting at ''number'' 40100, ''address'' will be 99. Etc.

This limits the number of ''addresses'' to 9,999 for each entity. A ''[[de facto]]'' referencing extends this to the maximum of 65,536.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modbus 101 – Introduction to Modbus|url=http://www.csimn.com/CSI_pages/Modbus101.html|publisher=Control Solutions, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It simply consists of adding one digit to the previous list:
* coil ''numbers'' span from '''0'''00001 to '''0'''65536,
* discrete input ''numbers'' span from '''1'''00001 to '''1'''65536,
* input register ''numbers'' span from '''3'''00001 to '''3'''65536,
* holding register ''numbers'' span from '''4'''00001 to '''4'''65536.
When using the extended referencing, all ''number'' references must have exactly 6 digits. This avoids confusion between coils and other entities. For example, to know the difference between holding register #40001 and coil #40001, if coil #40001 is the target, it must appear as #040001.

=== JBUS mapping ===
Another ''de facto'' protocol closely related to Modbus appeared after it, and was defined by PLC brand April Automates, the result of a collaborative effort between French companies [[Renault]] Automation and [[Merlin Gerin]] et Cie in 1985: '''JBUS'''. Differences between Modbus and JBUS at that time (number of entities, slave stations) are now irrelevant as this protocol almost disappeared with the April PLC series which AEG Schneider Automation bought in 1994 and then made obsolete. However the name JBUS has survived to some extent.

JBUS supports function codes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, and 16 and thus all the entities described above. However numbering is different with JBUS:
* Number and address coincide: entity #''x'' has address ''x'' in the data frame.
* Consequently, entity number does not include the entity type. For example, holding register #40010 in Modbus will be holding register #9, located at address 9 in JBUS.
* Number 0 (and thus address 0) is not supported. Slave should not implement any real data at this number and address and it can return a null value or throw an error when requested.

== Implementations ==
Almost all implementations have variations from the official standard. Different varieties might not communicate correctly between equipment of different suppliers. Some of the most common variations are:
* Data types
** [[IEEE floating-point]] number
** 32-bit integer
** 8-bit data
** Mixed data types
** Bit fields in integers
** Multipliers to change data to/from integer. 10, 100, 1000, 256 ...
* Protocol extensions
** 16-bit slave addresses
** 32-bit data size (1 address = 32 bits of data returned)
** Word-swapped data

== Limitations ==
* Since Modbus was designed in the late 1970s to communicate to [[programmable logic controller]]s, the number of data types is limited to those understood by PLCs at the time. Large binary objects are not supported.
* No standard way exists for a node to find the description of a data object, for example, to determine whether a register value represents a temperature between 30 and 175 degrees.
* Since Modbus is a master/slave protocol, there is no way for a field device to "report by exception" (except over Ethernet TCP/IP, called open-mbus) – the master node must routinely poll each field device and look for changes in the data. This consumes bandwidth and network time in applications where bandwidth may be expensive, such as over a low-bit-rate radio link.
* Modbus is restricted to addressing 254 devices on one data link, which limits the number of field devices that may be connected to a master station (once again, Ethernet TCP/IP being an exception).
* Modbus transmissions must be contiguous, which limits the types of remote communications devices to those that can buffer data to avoid gaps in the transmission.
* Modbus protocol itself provides no security against unauthorized commands or interception of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= |title=Critical Infrastructure Protection III |first= |last= |date=23–25 March 2009 |conference=Third IFIP WG 11. 10 International Conference |editor-last=Palmer |editor2-first=Sujeet |editor2-last=Shenoi |publisher=Springer |location=Hanover, New Hampshire |isbn=3-642-04797-1 |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Morris v. United States,''''' 174 U.S. 196 (1899), is a 5-to-2 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] which held that the bed under the [[Potomac River]] between the [[District of Columbia]] and the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] belonged to the [[United States government]] rather than nearby private landowners on the [[District of Columbia]] side.

==Background==
On June 20, 1632, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], [[List of English monarchs|King of England]], made a land grant in [[North America]] to [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] which became the [[Province of Maryland]] (later the state of [[Maryland]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Robert J. ''Maryland, a Middle Temperament, 1634-1980.'' Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, p. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; This grant set the boundary of Maryland at the low-water mark of the southern bank of the Potomac River.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, James Brown. ''Judicial Settlement of Controversies Between States of the American Union.'' Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1919, p. 473; Risjord, Norman K. ''Jefferson's America, 1760-1815.'' Lanham, Md.: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 1688, [[James II of England|King James II]] made a land grant in North American to [[Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper]] which became the [[Colony of Virginia]] (later the state of Virginia).&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Fairfax. ''Virginia Land Grants: A Study of Conveyancing in Relation to Colonial Politics.'' Westminster, Md.: Willow Bend Books, 1998, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; This grant designated "the Potomac River" as the boundary of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, W. Pinkney and Jones, Isaac D. ''Boundary Line Between the States of Maryland and Virginia. Before the Honorable Jeremiah S. Black, Honorable William A. Graham, and Honorable Charles J. Jenkins, Arbitrators Upon the Boundary Line Between the States of Virginia and Maryland.'' Baltimore, Md.: 1874, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The conflicting grants led to a long-running border dispute between Maryland and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Cutright, W.B.; Maxwell, Hu; Sayre, R.H.; and Brooks, Earle Amos. ''The History of Upshur County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Exploration and Settlement to the Present Time.'' Baltimore, Md.: Genealogical Pub. Co., 1996, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The two states settled navigational and [[riparian water rights]] in a compact in 1785, but the boundary dispute continued.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, James Brown. ''Judicial Settlement of Controversies Between States of the American Union.'' Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 1919, p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;Zimmerman, Joseph F. ''Interstate Disputes: The Supreme Court's Original Jurisdiction.'' Albany, N.Y.: State University of New York, 2006, p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The success of the compact led directly to calls for hold a series of meetings to improve the [[Articles of Confederation]], then the constitutional document of the United States. This meeting turned into the [[Philadelphia Convention]], which subsequently drafted the [[United States Constitution]]. See: Dellapenna, Joseph W. "Transboundary Water Allocation in the Twenty-First Century: Colloquiam Article: Interstate Struggles Over Rivers: The Southeastern States and the Struggle Over 'Hooch." ''[[New York University Environmental Law Journal]].'' 12:828 (2005), p. 867, n.216.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1788, the [[United States Constitution]] was ratified. The Constitution established an independent zone known as the District of Columbia for the seat of the new government. The [[Residence Act]] of 1790 provided for the new capital to be located on the Potomac River, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[George Washington]] was authorized by the [[United States Congress]] to determine the exact location (which he did a year later).&lt;ref&gt;Furer, Howard B. ''Washington, A Chronological and Documentary History, 1790-1970.'' Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.: Oceana Publications, 1975, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] formally established Congressional jurisdiction over the new District.&lt;ref&gt;diGiacomantonio, William C. "'To Make Hay While the Sun Shines': D.C. Governance As An Episode in the Revolution of 1800." In ''Establishing Congress: The Removal to Washington, D.C., and the Election of 1800.'' Kenneth R. Bowling and Donald R. Kennon, eds. Columbus, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2005, p. 39-56.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[District of Columbia retrocession#Virginia retrocession|Virginia retrocession]] of 1846-1847 returned that portion of the District of Columbia on the Virginia site of the Potomac River to the state of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D0g-AAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=District%20of%20Columbia%20retrocession&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q=District%20of%20Columbia%20retrocession&amp;f=false Tindall, William. ''Origin and Government of the District of Columbia.'' Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1908, p. 102-108.]&lt;/ref&gt; This left in doubt the exact position of the District's border with Virginia (just as Maryland's southern border remained in doubt).

[[File:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Chief Justice John Marshall, whose heirs were party to the suit.]]
Shortly after the creation of the District of Columbia, the United States government sold certain plots of land to James M. Marshall; his brother, [[John Marshall]] (later [[Chief Justice of the United States]]); John L. Kidwell; the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal|Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company]]; and several others.&lt;ref name="Worthy"&gt;Gutheim, Frederick A. and Lee, Antoinette J. ''Worthy of the Nation: Washington, D.C., From L'Enfant to the National Capital Planning Commission.'' Baltimore, Md.: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006, p. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maryland and Virginia agreed to arbitrate their dispute, and in 1877 the Black-Jenkins Award (as the decision of the arbitration panel is known) placed Virginia's boundary with Maryland at the low-water mark on the Virginia side of the Potomac River.&lt;ref name="Zimmerman" /&gt;

In 1882, Congress passed legislation providing for the dredging of the Potomac River, and for the dredged material to be used to fill in various tidal basins, marshes, and shores.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt; This created extensive new land along the northern shore of the Potomac River—land which adjoined that of the heirs of James Marshall, John Marshall, and John Kidwell, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company.  Congress passed legislation in August 1886 directing the [[Attorney General of the United States]] to protect the interests of the United States to the new land, and giving the courts jurisdiction over these claims.&lt;ref name="Worthy" /&gt;

The heirs and other claimants sued to win title to the lands.

==Decision==
===Majority opinion===
[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[George Shiras, Jr.]] wrote the majority opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice [[Melville Fuller]] and Justices [[John Marshall Harlan]], [[David Josiah Brewer]], and [[Henry Billings Brown]].

Justice Shiras first laid out the facts of the case in a lengthy syllabus, and established various classes of claimants.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 198-223.&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue Justice Shiras confronted was whether any of the parties could lay claim to the bed of the Potomac River (and thus the reclaimed lands built by the government).&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Shiras held that none of the heirs on the Virginia side of the river could make any claim to the riverbed.  Neither Lord Colepeper, his heir [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], nor any of Fairfax's heirs had ever seriously asserted title to the riverbed, and the Black-Jenkins Award clearly re-established that the boundary of Virginia ended at the low-water mark and did not extend to the riverbed.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on the Supreme Court's previous decision in ''[[Martin v. Waddell]]'', 41 U.S. 367 (1842), Justice Shiras argued that none of the Maryland landholders could claim title to the riverbed, either.  The majority held the original landholders were to hold the river and its bed in trust for the public, and that after the [[American Revolution]] these public trusts passed into the possession of the state (in this case, Maryland and in due time the District of Columbia).&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 227-228.&lt;/ref&gt; Shiras distinguished ''[[Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee]]'', 11 U.S. 603 (1813) by noting that ''Fairfax's Devisee'' did not involve Maryland or any Marylander claimant.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the riverbed had been assigned to Lord Fairfax and his heirs, Shiras concluded, the logic of ''Martin v. Waddell'' still held and delivered the lands into the control of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority dismissed the Kidwell heirs' claim to the newly created land under the same reasoning applied to the Marshall heirs.  However, Kidwell's heirs noted that Congress had conveyed the property to Kidwell under a resolution adopted on February 16, 1839. The majority held, however, that Congress did not intend by that resolution to convey the riverbed.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority relied heavily on the discussion in ''[[Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois]]'', 146 U.S. 387 (1892), ''[[Shively v. Bowlby]]'', 152 U.S. 1 (1894), and ''[[Mann v. Tacoma Land Company]]'', 153 U.S. 273 (1894),&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 236-238.&lt;/ref&gt; and from the express language of the resolution (which withheld from the grant any lands for public purposes).&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; Shiras produced a highly detailed history of the establishment of the boundaries of the District of Columbia, the plots within its boundaries, and how these plots were conveyed to the private landowners.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 246-266.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that none of the survey reports conveyed an interest in any riverbed. Shiras also noted that in ''[[Potomac Steam-Boat Co. v. Upper Potomac Steam-Boat Co.]]'', 109 U.S. 672 (1884), the Supreme Court had held that public streets were not part of any plot, and that Water Street (which bounded the Kidwell land to the south) distinctly separated the private land not only from the street itself but also from the newly created lands beyond it.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 266-269.&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the canal company's claims, the majority held that since none of the private landowners held riparian rights, the company could not obtain such rights from the private landowners.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 271-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was there any evidence that Congress was relinquishing its rights to Water Street or the river.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; The court dismissed the claims of the last landowners, whose property lay between Water Street and the shore, as being improperly based on unofficial land records&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 276.&lt;/ref&gt; and for being based on maps and other documents which did not accurately reflect the physical land.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 277-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgment was affirmed.

===Dissent===
Justice [[Edward Douglass White]], joined by Justice [[Rufus Wheeler Peckham]], dissented.

Justice White concluded that nothing in the record showed that the United States intended to withdraw the riparian water rights of the landholders when it built Water Street and cut the landholders off from the Potomac River.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 292-293.&lt;/ref&gt; White also engaged in a lengthy discussion of the laying out of the city's boundaries, and the conveyance of private property to the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 295-300.&lt;/ref&gt; There could be no doubt, White argued, that the private landowners intended to give all of their riparian rights to the federal government, and there could be no doubt that the federal government intended to give all riparian rights to those to whom it sold the land.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority's argument led to a tautology in which no riparian rights existed.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice White also examined the conveyance of the federal government's land to the new private landowners in depth as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 311-343.&lt;/ref&gt; In his discussion, White interpreted the "incorrect" maps as indicating the riparian rights to which the new private landowners were entitled (rather than a problem of inaccurate mapping). White concluded several times that the federal government fully intended to convey riparian rights to the new landowners because the government and its agents repeatedly indicated in letters, memoranda, contracts of sale, and other documents and statements its expectation that the waterside landowners were to build and maintain docks, wharves, and quays and improve the riparian rights they enjoyed. To assume otherwise, White concluded, was nonsensical.  Either the federal government intended to convey riparian rights, or the government deceptively contemplated building Water Street and cutting the new landowners off from their access.  "...the first hypothesis is the one naturally to be assumed."&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 343.&lt;/ref&gt; "The contracts for the sale of water lots with riparian rights attached, the reports of the surveyors, and the action of the commissioners, all blend into a harmonious and perfect whole, working from an original conception to a successful consummation of a well-understood result. The contrary view produces discord and disarrangement..."&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 311-347.&lt;/ref&gt;

White also discussed the District of Columbia's lengthy history regarding the regulation of wharves and docks.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 348-357.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, the city's treatment of the wharves demonstrated that the wharves were private property on private riverbed land, not private property licensed to be emplaced on a riverbed held in the public trust.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 357.&lt;/ref&gt; White interpreted ''Potomac Steam-Boat Co.'' as superimposing an [[easement]] on top of existing riparian water rights.&lt;ref&gt;''Morris v. United States'', 174 U.S. 196, 358.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not, as the majority held, the government's purpose all along to bound the plots of land with Water Street.

Justice White would have overturned the judgment of the lesser court for determination of the riparian rights of the landowners in question.

==Assessment==
In ''Morris v. United States'', the Supreme Court dealt with what was known as a "top common," a tract of land between a river and the land intended to be occupied and sold to private landowners.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, Thomas C. "Haunted By History: Colonial Land Trusts Post National Threat." ''William &amp; Mary Law Review.'' 48:303 (October 2006), p. 311, n.54.&lt;/ref&gt; Such practices were common in colonial America.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; ''Morris v. United States'' is considered an important case in the evolution of the law of rivers, streams, lakes, and other bodies of water, for it established that such bodies of water and their beds belonged to the public in common and were held in trust by the state for its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Jr., Warren M. "Property—Classifying Bodies of Water as Lakes or Streams." ''Tulane Law Review.'' 49:208 (November 1974), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;Wilkinson, Charles F.

''Environmental Law.'' 19:425 (Spring 1989), p. 455, n.122.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court further developed this [[public trust doctrine]] in ''Illinois Central Railroad v. Illinois'' in 1892 and more recently in ''[[Utah Division of State Lands v. United States]]'', 482 U.S. 193, 203 (1987).&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;

'''''Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co.''''', 243 U.S. 502 (1917), is [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that is notable as an early example of the [[patent misuse]] doctrine. It held that, because a patent grant is limited to the invention described in the claims of the patent, the patent law does not empower the patent owner, by notices attached to the patented article, to extend the scope of the patent monopoly by restricting the use of the patented article to materials necessary for their operation but forming no part of the patented invention, or to place downstream restrictions on the articles making them subject to conditions as to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Co.|volume=243|page=502|pin=|year=1917}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision overruled ''The Button-Fastener Case'',&lt;ref&gt;''Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co.'', 77 F. 288 (6th Cir. 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]'',&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{ussc|name=Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.|volume=224|page=1|pin=|year=1912}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which had held such restrictive notices effective and enforceable.

==Background==

[[File:Patent_diagram_on_projector_component_in_MPP_case.gif|300px|thumb|right|Diagram of patented device involved in ''MPP'' case]]

The [[Motion Picture Patents Company]] (MPP) was the assignee of a number of patents covering motion picture projectors, including US Pat. No.  707,934, on a part of the mechanism used in motion picture Projectors to  feed a film through the machine with a regular, uniform, and accurate movement. MPP granted to the Precision Machine Company (PMC) a license to manufacture and sell machines embodying the patented invention. The license provided that every machine PMC sold must be sold subject to a restriction and condition that the machine "shall be used solely for exhibiting or projecting motion pictures" embodying "the inventions of reissued letters patent No. 12,192"&lt;ref&gt;This patent was Thomas Edison's patent on motion picture film, which expired in 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; and leased by a licensee of [MPP]." The license also provided that the machine must have a plate attached to it stating, "The sale and purchase of this machine gives only the right to use it solely with moving pictures" embodying "the inventions of reissued letters patent No. 12,192" and leased by a licensee of [MPP]."&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 506.&lt;/ref&gt;

PMC made and sold one of the patented machines to the owner of the Seventy-Second Street Playhouse (a movie house on 72nd Street in New York City), with a plate containing the required notice. Prague Amusement Company (Prague) then leased the Seventy-Second Street Playhouse, and acquired the machine in question as a part of the equipment of the leased playhouse. Also, at that time, the [[Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] (Universal) made two films that were supplied to Prague for use on the machine. Prague used the machine to exhibit the films.&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

MPP sent letters protesting the alleged infringement of its patent, and then sued Universal, Prague, and the owner of the movie house. It was established at trial that 40,000 of the MPP machines are now in use in the US, and that the patented mechanism is the only one with which motion picture films can be used successfully. The district court held that the post-sale limitation on the use of the machine attempted to be made by the notice attached to it was invalid, and that the purchaser and its lessee had an implied license to use the machine as it had been used. The district court dismissed the case and the Second Circuit affirmed the district court.&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling of Supreme Court==

The Supreme Court, in an opinion written by Justice [[John Hessin Clarke|Clarke]] affirmed the judgment. Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Holmes]], joined by Justices McKenna and Van Devanter, dissented.

===Majority opinion===
[[File:John Hessin Clarke cph.3b09252.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Justice Clarke delivered the opinion of the Court]]

====The patent statute====

Justice Clarke began his analysis by observing that the patent statute does not provide for and thus authorize notices of the type involved here. Therefore, "whatever validity it [the notice] has must be derived from the general, and not from the patent, law."&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 509.&lt;/ref&gt; The statute gives the patentee the exclusive right to make, sell, and use the patented article. In interpreting the statute, three important rules have been declared by the Court:
# "The scope of every patent is limited to the invention described in the claims." The patentee "can claim nothing beyond them."
# The statute gives the patentee nothing but the power "to restrain others from manufacturing, using, or selling that which he has invented."
# "Since ''Pennock v. Dialogue'', 2 Pet. 1, was decided in 1829, this Court has consistently held that the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents, but is 'to promote the progress of science and the useful arts.'&amp;#8239;"&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 510-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;These rules of law make it very clear that the scope of the grant which may be made to an inventor in a patent, pursuant to the statute, must be limited to the invention described in the claims of his patent, and, to determine what grant may lawfully be so made, we must hold fast to the language of the act of Congress providing for it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This patent is only on the film projector mechanism described and claimed in the patent, the Court said. By the same token:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not concerned with, and has nothing to do with, the materials with which or on which the machine operates. The grant is of the exclusive right to use the mechanism to produce the result with any appropriate material, and the materials with which the machine is operated are no part of the patented machine or of the combination which produces the patented result. The difference is clear and vital between the exclusive right to use the machine, which the law gives to the inventor, and the right to use it exclusively with prescribed materials to which such a license notice as we have here seeks to restrict it.&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 511-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The rise of the inherency doctrine====

Until recently, the Court said, this plain meaning of the statute was generally understood as the law. But with the growth of corporations the idea had arisen "of gathering great profits in small payments, which are not realized or resented, from many, rather than smaller or even equal profits in larger payments" and so patentees have come to seek to assert "the right to restrict the use of [patented machinery] to materials or supplies not described in the patent, and not, by its terms, made a part of the thing patented." A majority of the Supreme Court had accepted that principle several years earlier in ''[[Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.]]''&lt;ref name=Henry/&gt;

The Court traced the evolution of this idea and explained why a majority of the Court rejected it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The construction of the patent law which justifies as valid the restriction of patented machines, by notice, to use with unpatented supplies necessary in the operation of them, but which are no part of them, is believed to have originated in ''[[Heaton-Peninsular Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co.]]'' (which has come to be widely referred to as the ''Button-Fastener Case''), decided by .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. the Sixth Circuit in 1896.

.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. This decision [''Button-Fastener''] proceeds upon the argument that, since the patentee may withhold his patent altogether from public use, he must logically and necessarily be permitted to impose any conditions which he chooses upon any use which he may allow of it. The defect in this thinking springs from the substituting of inference and argument for the language of the statute, and from failure to distinguish between the rights which are given to the inventor by the patent law and which he may assert against all the world through an infringement proceeding, and rights which he may create for himself by private contract which, however, are subject to the rules of general as distinguished from those of the patent, law. While it is true that, under the statutes as they were (and now are), a patentee might withhold his patented machine from public use, yet, if he consented to use it himself or through others, .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. he is thereby restricted to the use of the invention as it is described in the claims of his patent, and not as it may be expanded by limitations as to materials and supplies necessary to the operation of it, imposed by mere notice to the public.

The .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. obvious possibilities for gain in the method which it approved led to an immediate and widespread adoption of the system, in which these restrictions expanded into more and more comprehensive forms until at length the case at bar is reached, with a machine sold and paid for, yet claimed still to be subject not only to restriction as to supplies to be used, but also subject to any restrictions or conditions as to use .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. which the company which authorized its sale may see fit, after the sale, from time to time to impose. The perfect instrument of favoritism and oppression which such a system of doing business, if valid, would put into the control of the owner of such a patent should make courts astute, if need be, to defeat its operation. If these restrictions were sustained, plainly the plaintiff might, for its own profit or that of its favorites, .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. ruin anyone unfortunate enough to be dependent upon its confessedly important improvements for the doing of business.&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 514-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justice Clarke denied the legitimacy of this doctrine, because it extended the power of the patent monopoly from the claimed and patented invention—the mechanism described in the patent—to the unpatented supplies used with the mechanism, which were no part of the statutory monopoly:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[F]or the reasons stated in this opinion, we are convinced that the exclusive right granted in every patent must be limited to the invention described in the claims of the patent, and that it is not competent for the owner of a patent, by notice attached to its machine, to in effect extend the scope of its patent monopoly by restricting the use of it to materials necessary in its operation, but which are no part of the patented invention, or to send its machines forth into the channels of trade of the country subject to conditions as to use or royalty to be paid, to be imposed thereafter at the discretion of such patent owner. The patent law furnishes no warrant for such a practice, and the cost, inconvenience, and annoyance to the public which the opposite conclusion would occasion forbid it.&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 515-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court therefore concluded, first, that ''Henry v. A.B. Dick'' must be overruled. Second, the notice on the plate affixed to the machine contains an invalid restriction that the machine must be used only with film embodying the invention of the Edison patent that expired in 1914. "[S]uch a film is obviously not any part of the invention of the patent in suit." Therefore, the notice "is an attempt, without statutory warrant, to continue the patent monopoly in this particular character of film after it has expired," and to enforce it "would be to create a monopoly in the manufacture and use of moving picture films wholly outside of the patent in suit and of the patent law as we have interpreted it." This notice restriction is contrary to public policy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A restriction which would give to the plaintiff such a potential power for evil over an industry which must be recognized as an important element in the amusement life of the nation, under the conclusions we have stated in this opinion, is plainly void because wholly without the scope and purpose of our patent laws, and because, if sustained, it would be gravely injurious to that public interest, which we have seen is more a favorite of the law than is the promotion of private fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 518-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Holmes dissent===
[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes dissented]]

Justice Holmes had been part of the majority of the Court that endorsed the inherency doctrine in ''Henry v. A.B. Dick'', and he strongly dissented from its rejection and overruling in the ''Motion Picture Patents'' case.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes was "the most consistent defender of" this doctrine "since its inception." Note, 4 {{smallcaps|Iowa L. Rev.}} 40, 42 (1918).&lt;/ref&gt; Justices McKenna and Van Devanter, also in the majority in ''A.B. Dick'', joined the Holmes dissent here. Holmes reasoned that a patentee may keep his invention out of use for the term of the patent, for whatever reason he may choose. "So much being undisputed, I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer, will use some unpatented thing in connection with it." He added, "''Non debet, cui plus licet, quod minus est non licere''."&lt;ref&gt;He who is permitted to do the greater, may with greater reason do the less. This maxim does not take into account whether the public has an interest that is disserved by the acceptance of the condition. See, e.g., ''Lear, Inc. v. Adkins'', 395 U.S. 653 (1969) (holding agreement not to challenge patent validity unenforceable because contrary to public interest in eliminating spurious patents from economy). It does not take into account whether the other party agrees to the condition because it is imposed in a contract of adhesion. See, e.g., ''West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish'', 300 U.S. 379, 398 (1937) (upholding minimum wage law for women because they were the lowest paid class, with relatively weak bargaining power and the "ready victims" of those who would take advantage of their status).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese teapot.JPG|thumb|left|200px|"If the owner prefers to keep the pot unless you will buy his tea, I cannot see, in allowing him the right to do so, anything more than an ordinary incident of ownership."]]

Holmes did allow, however, "No doubt this principle might be limited or excluded in cases where the condition tends to bring about a state of things that there is a predominant public interest to prevent." But he was quick to add that in his view "there is no predominant public interest to prevent a patented teapot or film feeder from being kept from the public, because, as I have said, the patentee may keep them tied up at will while his patent lasts." He also saw no problem in the alleged extension of the patent monopoly from the claimed mechanism to the films made the condition of use of the mechanism. That effect occurs "only to the extent of the desire for the teapot or film feeder, and if the owner prefers to keep the pot or the feeder unless you will buy his tea or films, I cannot see, in allowing him the right to do so, anything more than an ordinary incident of ownership."&lt;ref&gt;243 U.S. at 519-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

The ''Motion Picture Patents'' case is often credited with forming the basis for the Supreme Court’s creation of an equitable defense of patent misuse to a claim of patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Vincent Chiapetta, [http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1167&amp;context=iplr ''Living with Patents: Insights from Patent Misuse''], 15 {{smallcaps|Intell. Prop. L. Rev.}} 1, 4 n.15 ("The first inklings of misuse are found in the Supreme Court’s 1917 decision in ''Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co''.) (2011); ''id''. at 15 ("The doctrine’s origins trace back to the Court’s 1917 decision in ''Motion Picture Patents Co''.); Matthew W. Siegal and Claude G. Szyfer, [http://www.stroock.com/siteFiles/Pub419.pdf ''Supreme Court Relaxes View of Tying Patents''], 235 N.Y.L.J. 1, 2 (Mar. 27, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent, however, that the misuse doctrine (at least when it applies to sold patented articles and restricts purchasers' use of the articles) is an aspect or outgrowth of the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]], it is preceded by such decisions as ''[[Adams v. Burke]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Adams v. Burke|volume=84|page=453|pin=|year=1873|reporter=Wall.|reporter-volume=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Carbice''===

Im ''[[Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Development Corp.|volume=283|page=27|pin=|year=1931}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court considered a case in which a patentee, who had a patent on a "package consisting of a protective casing of insulating material having packed therein a quantity of frozen carbon dioxide ["dry ice"] in an insulating container and a quantity of freezable product in freezing proximity to said frozen carbon dioxide," where the frozen carbon dioxide was placed at the center, surrounded by the freezable product, surrounded on the outside by the packaging material. The patentee's exclusive licensee sold dry ice to its customers with an implied license to use the container invention without the payment of royalty, but subject to the condition that the customers use the dry ice only with containers from a designated source and that they use the containers only with dry ice bought from the licensee. Carbice, the defendant in this case, sold dry ice with knowledge that it would be used by the purchasers in packages like those described in the patent. The patentee and exclusive licensee sued Carbice for contributing to infringement by the purchasers of its dry ice. The Supreme Court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relief here sought is indistinguishable from that denied in the ''Motion Picture Case''. There, it was held that to permit the patent owner to "derive its profit not from the invention on which the law gives it a monopoly, but from the unpatented supplies with which it is used" is "wholly without the scope of the patent monopoly." If a monopoly could be so expanded, the owner of a patent for a product might conceivably monopolize the commerce in a large part of unpatented materials used in its manufacture. The owner of a patent for a machine might thereby secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented supplies consumed in its operation. The owner of a patent for a process might secure a partial monopoly on the unpatented material employed in it.&lt;ref&gt;283 U.S. at 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court therefore denied relief for the claimed infringement.

===''Leitch v. Barber''===

In ''[[Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.|volume=302|page=458|pin=|year=1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court extended the doctrine of the ''Motion Picture Case'' case. Barber had a patent on a process for improving the curing of concrete pavement by spreading tar on it to inhibit evaporation (thereby giving the water molecules more time to bond to the concrete and make it harder). Leitch sold tar to a road builder, knowing that it was to be used in accordance with the patented method. Barber sued Leitch for contributory infringement. Barber had exploited his patent by selling tar to road builders with the understanding that they could use the patented method with Barber's tar; it granted no written license.

Barber argued that ''Carbice'' did not apply because it granted no license on a condition of tying supplies. The Court said that it had adopted "a method of doing the business which is the practical equivalent of granting a written license with a condition that the patented method may be practiced" only with tar purchased from it." Accordingly, "the sole purpose to which the patent is put is thereby to suppress competition in the production and sale of staple unpatented material for this use in road building." The Court held that the doctrine of the ''Carbice'' case applied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the rule there declared every use of a patent as a means of obtaining a limited monopoly of unpatented material is prohibited. It applies whether the patent be for a machine, a product, or a process. It applies whatever the nature of the device by which the owner of the patent seeks to effect such unauthorized extension of the monopoly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Morton Salt''===

''Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Morton Salt Co. v. G.S. Suppiger Co.|volume=314|page=488|pin=|year=1942}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first case in which the Court expressly labeled as “misuse” the ''Motion Picture Patent''&lt;wbr&gt;/&lt;wbr&gt;''Carbice'' defense to a charge of patent infringement and created the present blanket remedy in infringement cases of unenforceability of the misused patent.&lt;ref&gt;The Court stated: "Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated." 314 U.S. at 493.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppiger had a patent on a machine for dispensing salt tablets into food cans in the canning process. It leased the patented machines to canners and required lessee&lt;wbr&gt;/&lt;wbr&gt;licensees of its patent to buy their salt tablets used in the machines from its subsidiary. Morton leased machines to the canners that Suppiger charged infringed its patent.

Based on these facts, the Court said, "It thus appears that [Suppiger] is making use of its patent monopoly to restrain competition in the marketing of unpatented articles, salt tablets, for use with the patented machines, and is aiding in the creation of a limited monopoly in the tablets not within that granted by the patent." Citing ''Motion Picture Patents'', ''Carbice'', and ''Leitch'', the Court stated, "It is the established rule that a patentee who has granted a license on condition that the patented invention be used by the licensee only with unpatented materials furnished by the licensor may not restrain as a contributory infringer one who sells to the licensee like materials for like use."

Such conduct is contrary to the public policy of the United States:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he the public policy which includes inventions within the granted monopoly excludes from it all that is not embraced in the invention. It equally forbids the use of the patent to secure an exclusive right or limited monopoly not granted by the Patent Office and which it is contrary to public policy to grant.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Courts of equity may withhold their aid from a party that asserts a right that it is using contrary to the public interest. Suppiger argued that ''Motion Picture Patents'', ''Carbice'', and ''Leitch'' all involved contributory infringement actions where the patentee sought to restrain a defendant from selling unpatented supplies to licensees, but here, Suppiger said:

* Suppiger does not ask the courts to order Morton to stop competing in the sale of salt. 
* Rather, Suppiger just asks the courts to order Morton to stop directly infringing the patent.
* The equity maxim that a party seeking the aid of a court of equity must come into court with "clean hands" applies only to the plaintiff's wrongful conduct in the particular act or transaction as to which equity enforcement is sought.
* Therefore, the maxim involved in those cases does not apply to the different transaction—direct infringement—involved here.

The Court did not accept the attempted distinction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]dditional considerations must be taken into account where maintenance of the suit concerns the public interest, as well as the private interests of suitors. Where the patent is used as a means of restraining competition with the patentee's sale of an unpatented product, the successful prosecution of an infringement suit, even against one who is not a competitor in such sale, is a powerful aid to the maintenance of the attempted monopoly of the unpatented article, and is thus a contributing factor in thwarting the public policy underlying the grant of the patent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court explained that equity precedent supported denial of relief that would further wrongdoing by the party seeking the relief and thus harm the public interest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Equity may rightly withhold its assistance from such a use of the patent by declining to entertain a suit for infringement, and should do so at least until it is made to appear that the improper practice has been abandoned and that the consequences of the misuse of the patent have been dissipated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The reasons for barring the prosecution of such a suit against one who is not a competitor with the patentee in the sale of the unpatented product are fundamentally the same as those which preclude an infringement suit against a licensee who has violated a condition of the license by using with the licensed machine a competing unpatented article [as protection] ''Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co''.  .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. It is the adverse effect upon the public interest of a successful infringement suit in conjunction with the patentee's course of conduct which disqualifies him to maintain the suit, regardless of whether the particular defendant has suffered from the misuse of the patent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These considerations made it unnecessary, the Court added, to decide whether Suppiger had committed an antitrust violation "for we conclude that, in any event, the maintenance of the present suit to restrain petitioner's manufacture or sale of the alleged infringing machines is contrary to public policy, and that the district court rightly dismissed the complaint for want of equity."

===''Kimble v. Marvel''===

In ''[[Kimble v. Marvel]]'' in 2015, after some years of lower court disapproval and disregard of the [[patent misuse]] doctrine developed in ''Motion Picture Patents'', ''Carbice'', and ''Suppiger'', the Supreme Court reaffirmed its principles. In particular, the Court rejected the argument that patent misuse should track antitrust doctrine and insisted that patent misuse is based on patent policy rather than antitrust policy. This is not to say that an antitrust violation will not usually be the basis for holding unenforceable the patents misused in committing the antitrust violation,&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States Gypsum Co. v. National Gypsum Co.'', 352 U.S. 457 (1957), in which the Court found misuse based on the antitrust violation previously found in ''United States v. United States Gypsum Co.'', 333 U. S. 364 (1948), "because patent misuse was the essence of the old antitrust litigation," 352 U.S. at 464.&lt;/ref&gt; but rather that the misuse doctrine prohibits even conduct that does not rise (or sink) to the level of an antitrust violation,&lt;ref&gt;''Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.'', 395 U.S. 100 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; and where antitrust does not reach challenged conduct patent misuse will do so if patent policy so requires.

==Commentary==

● A very terse contemporary comment by "A.M.K." in the ''California Law Review'' on the ''Motion Picture Patents'' case and its overruling of ''A.B. Dick'' and the ''Button-Fastener'' case stated what the following commentary by Professor Chiapetta explains in greater detail some years later. A.M.K. said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It by no means follows that because a patentee may withhold the use of the patented article entirely he may license its use with any conditions he chooses. It may be better that the public should not enjoy the article at all than that it should be used under restrictions obnoxious to public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Comment, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3474688 ''Restraint of Trade: Common Law: Patents''], 5 {{smallcaps|Cal. L. Rev.}} 425, 428 (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

● A 1918 Note in the ''Iowa Law Review'' is critical of the Holmes dissent as well. "Mr. Justice Holmes, who has been the most consistent defender of the restriction theory since its inception, argues in the latest decision that since the patentee may wholly withdraw his invention from the market, he should be permitted to sell it on any terms or conditions he may wish to impose." The Note writer says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The difficulty with this reasoning is that if it proves anything, it proves too much. If it is true that because a man may withhold a patented article from the market, he may therefore impose any conditions upon its use when he sells, it should be equally true that because a man owns a horse that he need not sell, he may at the time of sale impose any conditions upon its future use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But that cannot be a valid test, he continues, because it is against the common law. "It is a general rule that covenants do not run with personalty and contracts restricting the use or resale of personalty cannot be annexed to the chattel so as to follow and obligate the purchaser by notice," citing Coke and other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ilr4&amp;div=7&amp;start_page=40&amp;collection=journals&amp;set_as_cursor=47&amp;men_tab=srchresults Note], ''The Right of the Patentee To Control the Use or Price of a Patented Article Upon Resale'', 4 {{smallcaps|Iowa L. Rev.}} 40, 42 (1918). ''Coke on Littleton'' §&amp;nbsp;360, for example, gives a restraint accompanying the sale of a horse as an illustration of the invalidity of a post–sale restraint.&lt;/ref&gt;

● New York patent attorney (later Federal Circuit judge) Giles Rich commented that "the patent law 'went on a spree from 1896 to 1917.' "&lt;ref&gt;Giles Rich, ''The Relation Between Patent Practices and the Anti-Monopoly Laws'', 24 {{smallcaps|J. Pat. Off. Soc'y}} 85, 88 (1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

● Professor Chiapetta compares the majority's and Holmes's dissent's respective analyses of the inherency doctrine and concludes that Holmes's analysis ignores the issue of whether the benefits of increased usage of the patented invention under a restrictive license exceed the harms resulting from the restriction. He concedes, for purposes of a "Chicago School" analysis,  that it is true that any increased access produces some efficiency improvement. It is not true, however, he insists, that every increase in access produces a net improvement: "That determination requires examining the harms produced by the terms of access. If those harms exceed the benefits then the transaction reduces efficient market operation overall and should be legally prohibited."

He explains, further, that a patentee's simple refusal to license a patent may lead to loss of efficiency but the costs are those arising from the existence of the patent system. "If that produces net inefficiencies, the problem lies exclusively" in the way the U.S. patent system has been set up, which is a matter of congressional choice, subject only to constitutional limitations. Privately constructed terms of access (licensing conditions) can produce additional costs, which may arise from effects of imposing conditions on the licensee. "As the ''Motion Picture'' majority properly observes, such rights must be examined to determine whether their harms outweigh the benefits."&lt;ref&gt;Chiapetta at 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The determination of what constitutes a legally cognizable harm that may be balanced off against the benefits of increased access, to decide what is the net harm or benefit "is the purview of general laws.” These include contract, tort, and antitrust laws. Unless the constraints of the general law are taken into account, he argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[I]ncreased access may, in efficiency terms, be worse for society than no access at all. While the latter merely produces patent law’s internal net system efficiency improvement (additional innovation justifying the costs of reduced access), the former can impose additional costs producing a net overall efficiency decrease. Such transactions must be legally prohibited.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The proper question, Chiapatta insists, is whether the majority's or Holmes's legal doctrine better contributes to accomplishing the goal of net overall efficiency increase.&lt;ref&gt;Chiapetta at 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10424">In [[genetics]], a '''non-paternity event'''  is when someone who is presumed to be an individual's father is not in fact the biological father. This presumption may be on the part of the individual, the parents, or the physician. Non-paternity may result from [[sperm donation]], undisclosed adoption, intercourse with multiple partners in close succession, non-consensual sex, as well as medical mistakes, for example, mixups during procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=2005bellis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bellis MA, Hughes K, Hughes S, Ashton JR |title=Measuring paternal discrepancy and its public health consequences |journal=J Epidemiol Community Health |volume=59 |issue=9 |pages=749–54 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16100312 |pmc=1733152 |doi=10.1136/jech.2005.036517 |url=http://jech.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16100312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is uncertainty, the most reliable technique for establishing paternity is [[genetic testing]]; however, there is still a risk of error due to the potential for [[gene mutation]]s or scoring errors.

Overall, the incidence of misattributed paternity ranges from about 2% to 12%, though it may be higher in certain populations. The discovery of previously unsuspected or undisclosed non-paternity may have both social and medical consequences. Non-paternity that is due to a previously undisclosed extra-marital relationship often has serious consequences for a marital relationship. Non-paternity is medically relevant when interpreting the results and utility of genetic screening for [[hereditary]] illnesses.

==Definitions and uses==
Bellis et al. (2005) stated that misattributed paternity "occurs when a child is believed to have been fathered by the husband (or partner) but is actually the progeny of another man."&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt; Non-paternity events are also sometimes referred to as misattributed paternity, paternal discrepancy or false paternity.&lt;!----&gt; Although it is sometimes referred to as [[paternity fraud]], this suggests that the misattribution was deliberate rather than accidental.&lt;ref name=2005draper&gt;{{cite journal |last= Draper |first= Heather |year= 2005 |title= Paternity fraud and compensation for misattributed paternity |journal= Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue= 8 |pages= 475–480 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2005.013268 |pmid= 17664309 |pmc= 2598159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a scientific review of non-paternity studies since the 1950s, Bellis et al. (2005) stated that knowingly covering up an accidental pregnancy that resulted from infidelity is often assumed to be the reason for non-paternity, but that there are many other reasons, "for example, where sex with the long term partner has not produced children a woman might seek conception elsewhere." They said other reasons might be undisclosed adoptions, accidental misattribution resulting from multiple relationships in close succession as well as medical mistakes, such as mixups during procedures such as [[in vitro fertilization]] and [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;

In [[genetic genealogy]] the term non-paternity is often used in a wider context to indicate a break in the link between the [[Y-chromosome]] and the surname. Such a breakage may occur because of formal or informal adoption, premarital or extramarital intercourse or rape, or when individuals use a different surname than their biological father, such as their mother's maiden name, a stepfather's name, the use of aliases or a legal name change.&lt;ref name=2006bopp&gt;{{citation|last=Bopp|first=Georgia K.|title=Non-Paternal Event (NPE)|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~gkbopp/DNA/falsepaternal.htm|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing for non-paternity==
{{further information|DNA paternity testing}}
The most reliable test for paternity is [[genetic testing]], sometimes referred to as [[DNA]] testing. Requirements for consent and counselling vary by country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} However, genetic testing is based on probabilities and is not always definitive. Jones et al. (2010) said, "Characteristics of the markers and the fact that they are analysed by fallible humans can result in inconsistencies that present problems for parentage analysis." False negatives may occur due to low quality samples, [[gene mutation]]s, or [[genotyping]] errors (when a [[genotype]] is misread or inaccurately scored). There is a higher probability of accuracy when DNA from both parents can be tested. The accuracy increases even more when DNA from a sibling is available.&lt;ref name=2010jones&gt;{{citation|last=Jones|title=A practical guide to methods of parentage analysis|url=https://web.natur.cuni.cz/~muncling/Jones%202010%20paternity.pdf|journal=Molecular Ecology Resources|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=6–30|doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02778.x|pmid=21564987|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rates of non-paternity==

===Typical births===
It is difficult to accurately estimate the incidence of misattributed paternity, and there have been large discrepancies in the research published on the topic. Often data on non-paternity rates are reported tangentially to the primary goal of research without sufficient detail, and very few studies involve randomized samples. As such, it is not possible to make valid generalizations based on a large portion of the available literature.&lt;ref name=1991macintyre&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Macintyre S, Sooman A|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Non-paternity and prenatal genetic screening|journal=Lancet|year=1991|volume=338|issue=8771|pmid=1681226|pages=869–871|doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)91513-T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellis et al. (2005) found that between 1950 and 2004, the rates of misattributed paternity published in scientific journals ranged from 0.8% to 30% with a median of 3.7%.&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt; According to a study published in the ''Lancet'', "High rates have been quoted, but are often unsupported by any published evidence or based on unrepresentative population samples."&lt;ref name=1991macintyre/&gt;

[[Turi King]] and Mark Jobling of the Department of Genetics at [[University of Leicester]] called the commonly cited 30% rate of non-paternity an "urban myth".&lt;ref name=2009rincon&gt;{{cite news|author=Rincon P|title=Study debunks illegitimacy 'myth'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7881652.stm|work=BBC News|date=11 February 2009|accessdate=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to King and Jobling, the figure is around 2%. They also stated that misattributed paternity is often impacted by cultural and socioeconomic factors and that it occurs more frequently among couples who aren't married.&lt;ref name=2009king&gt;{{citation|last1=King|first1=Turi E.|last2=Jobling|first2=Mark A.|title=Founders, Drift, and Infidelity: The Relationship between Y Chromosome Diversity and Patrilineal Surnames|pmc=2668828|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|volume=26|issue=5|year=2009|pmid=19204044|doi=10.1093/molbev/msp022|pages=1093–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Michael Gilding concluded that inflated figures have been circulated by the media, the [[Parental test|paternity testing]] industry,  [[fathers' rights movement|fathers' rights activists]] and [[evolutionary psychologist]]s.&lt;ref name=2009gilding&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gilding |first1= Michael |year= 2005 |title= Rampant misattributed paternity: the creation of an urban myth |journal= People and Place |volume= 13 |issue= 12 |pages= 1&amp;ndash;11 |publisher= [[Monash University]] |doi= |url= http://arrow.monash.edu.au/hdl/1959.1/480786 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2009bgilding&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilding | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1177/0038038508099102 | title = Paternity Uncertainty and Evolutionary Psychology: How a Seemingly Capricious Occurrence Fails to Follow Laws of Greater Generality | journal = Sociology | volume = 43 | pages = 140–691 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He traced many of these overestimates back to a 1972 conference where non-paternity rates as high as 30% were discussed.&lt;ref name=1973philipp&gt;Philipp EE (1973) "Discussion: moral, social and ethical issues". In: Wolstenholme GEW, Fitzsimons DW, eds. ''Law and ethics of AID and embryo transfer''. Ciba Foundation symposium. Vol 17. London: Associated Scientific 63–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilding states that these data only show the incidence of non-paternity in cases where disputed parentage was the ''reason'' for paternity testing. &lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;&lt;ref name=2011gilding&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilding|first=Michael|title=The fatherhood myth: Michael Gilding unravels the uncertain data about mistaken paternity|date=26 July 2011|url=http://inside.org.au/the-fatherhood-myth/|publisher=The inside story|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where disputed parentage was the reason for the paternity testing, there were higher levels with an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk of parental discrepancy were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain ethnic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name=2005bellis/&gt;

===Atypical multiple births===
{{main|heteropaternal superfecundation}}
Rarely, genetic testing has revealed children from [[multiple birth]]s to have different fathers, which is known as "[[heteropaternal superfecundation]]". One study estimated that the incidence of bipaternal twins born to white women in the United States is around one pair in 400.&lt;ref name=1993james&gt;{{citation|last=James|first=WH|title=The incidence of superfecundation and of double paternity in the general population|pmid=7871943|journal=Acta geneticae medicae et gemellologiae|year=1993|volume=42|issue=3–4|pages=257–62|doi=10.1017/s0001566000003263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found the prevalence to be approximately one pair in 13,000 cases.&lt;ref name=2015garcia&gt;{{citation|last=Garcia|title=Heteropaternal superfecundation: Implicancies in forensic genetics|url=http://www.fsigeneticssup.com/article/S1875-1768(15)30173-6/abstract|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series|year=2015|volume=5|page=e633|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.fsigss.2015.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{voting}}
"'''None of the above'''", or '''NOTA''' for short, also known as "'''against all'''" or a "'''scratch'''" vote, is a [[ballot]] option in some [[jurisdiction]]s or [[organization]]s, designed to allow the voter to indicate disapproval of the candidates in a [[voting system]]. It is based on the principle that [[consent]] requires the ability to withhold consent in an election, just as they can by voting "No" on [[referendum|ballot questions]].

Entities that include "None of the Above" on ballots as standard procedure include [[India]] ("None of the above"), [[Greece]] (λευκό, white), the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]] ([[None of These Candidates]]), [[Ukraine]] (''Проти всіх'','' "against all"''), [[Spain]] (''voto en blanco'', "white vote"), and [[Colombia]] (''voto en blanco''). [[Russia]] had such an option on its ballots (''Против всех,'' "against all") until it was abolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/12773 |title=Russians Divided Over Electoral Reforms: Angus Reid Global Monitor |publisher=Angus-reid.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906002157/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/12773|archivedate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangladesh]] introduced this option (''না ভোট''&lt;!---This needs an English translation---&gt;) in 2008.&lt;ref name=bd&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh amends election law incorporating 'no' vote option|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-07-14/rest-of-world/27918086_1_general-elections-votes-amendment|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=Jul 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan introduced this option on ballot papers for the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 Pakistan elections]], but the [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] later rejected it.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/530557/none-of-the-above-vote-to-be-added-to-ballots-ecp/ |title='None of the above' vote to be added to ballots: ECP - The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], [[Bulgaria]] introduced a 'none of the above' option, which received 5.59% of the vote in the first round and 4.47% in the run-off.

When "None of the Above" is listed on a ballot, there is the possibility of NOTA receiving a [[majority]] or [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the vote, and so "winning" the election. In such a case, a variety of formal procedures may be invoked, including having the office remain vacant, having the office filled by appointment, re-opening [[nomination]]s or holding another election (in a body operating under [[parliamentary procedure]]), or it may have no effect whatsoever, as in India and the US state of Nevada, where the next highest total wins regardless.

==Soviet Union==
In the 1990 elections that led to the [[break-up of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet version of "none of above" led to new elections with new candidates in 200 races of the 1,500-seat [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]].&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arunachaltimes.in/wordpress/2013/10/09/nota-voting/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174514/http://www.arunachaltimes.in/wordpress/2013/10/09/nota-voting/ |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 incumbents representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] were defeated in the run-off, leading to [[Boris Yeltsin]] to later say the "none of the above" option "helped convince the people they had real power even in a rigged election, and [it] played a role in building true democracy."&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;

==Spain==

===Blank ballot===
Due to the Spanish voting regulations (''[[:es:Legislación electoral española|legislación electoral española]]''), {{es icon}} the blank ballot is recognized as 'none of the above' (''voto en blanco'') but has very little chance to influence the distribution of seats within a democratic election. It is mostly considered as a statistical indicator of candidatures' disapproval. The blank ballots only increase the amount of valid votes, raising the threshold of votes (3% and 5% depending on the election) which every political party has to overcome to be fully considered. The parties over the threshold get their seats according to the [[D'Hondt method]].

===Blank seats (''Escaños en blanco'')===
Since 1999, several political parties&lt;ref&gt;[https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico/partido_politicoDatos.html?nmformacion=2244] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico/partido_politicoDatos.html?nmformacion=2403] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=FF84718865B5919798D2C716A220398B|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121218100841/https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=FF84718865B5919798D2C716A220398B|deadurl=yes|title=Registro de Partidos Políticos|author=|date=18 December 2012|archivedate=18 December 2012|website=MIR.es|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=0523926EC252D8B19A3526ACD78D64B5|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121218045639/https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=0523926EC252D8B19A3526ACD78D64B5|deadurl=yes|title=Registro de Partidos Políticos|author=|date=18 December 2012|archivedate=18 December 2012|website=MIR.es|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121019030317/https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html|title=Registro de Partidos Políticos|first=Ministerio del|last=Interior|website=webarchive.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; have arisen in order to make visible the 'none of the above' option in the parliaments and force empty seats. "Blank Seats" ran for the Congress and Senate elections of 20 November 2011. Its programme is to leave empty the corresponding assigned seats by not taking full possession of their duties as congressperson, senator, etc. According to law, the seat remains assigned to the elected candidate until the possession act takes place, the elected candidate explicitly refuses or new elections are called. In this way, the political party and its candidates stay free from obligations and are not entitled to receive any money from the public funding scheme for politics.

By voting such option at the local elections in May 2011, the citizens of the villages of Gironella (Barcelona) and Foixà (Girona) were able to reduce the number of politicians in their councils by one and two respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-escons-blanc-dejara-tres-concejalias-vacias-catalunya-20110608174059.html |title=Escons en Blanc dejará tres concejalías vacías en Catalunya |language=es |website=Europapress.es |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Empar Moliner |url=http://www.ara.cat/especials/eleccions22m/Escons-Blanc-aconsegueix-consistoris-catalans_0_486551938.html |title=Escons en Blanc aconsegueix que tres cadires quedin buides als consistoris catalans |website=Ara.cat |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, citizenship supported Blank Seats at different municipalities, including Barcelona, with 15,582 votes (averaging 1.71% of valid votes).

The [[Ciudadanos En Blanco]] (Citizens for Blank Votes) party aims to give blank ballots the meaning of representing empty seats if the votes indicate so as for any other party, disbanding the party when such law would be approved.

==United States==
The origins of the ballot option "None of the Above" in the United States can be traced to when the State of Nevada adopted "[[None of These Candidates]]" as a ballot option in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html|title='None Of The Above' Ballot Option In Nevada Upheld By Federal Appeals Court|date=2015-11-25|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125044018/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html |archivedate=25 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 in California, citizen proponents of Proposition 23, titled the "None of the Above Act", qualified a new State ballot initiative through circulated petitions submitted to the Secretary of State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=None of the Above Act|url=http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1945&amp;context=ca_ballot_inits|website=University of California, Hastings|publisher=UC Hastings|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the measure was defeated in the March 2000 general election 64% to 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 23 election results|url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_23,_the_%22None_of_the_Above%22_Act_(2000)|website=BallotPedia|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Were it to be passed by the voters, it was meant to require this new ballot option for all state and federal elective offices, exempting only local judicial races; in determining official election results, the "none of the above" voter tally would be discarded in favor of the candidate with the greatest number of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/initiatives-by-title-and-summary-year.pdf |format=PDF |title=INITIATIVES BY TITLE AND SUMMARY YEAR |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2016-05-07 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907193230/http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/initiatives-by-title-and-summary-year.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No similar options were known to have been permitted, much less approved, on any other state levels, least of all the federal level, as of the middle of August 2016.

{{further|None of the Above in Indian Elections}}
The [[Election Commission of India]] told the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] in 2009 that it wished to offer the voter a "none of the above" option on ballots, which the government had generally opposed.&lt;ref name=ibn&gt;{{cite web |last=Bagriya |first=Ashok |title=EC suggests 'none of the above' option on the ballot |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/indiaelections/2009/04/2009418114915169787.html |publisher=IBN Live |date= 29 January 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]], a [[non-governmental organisation]], filed a [[public-interest litigation (India)|public-interest litigation]] statement in support of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sorabjee|first=Soli J.|title=Right of negative voting|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/right-of-negative-voting/429335/|accessdate=27 September 2013|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2013, the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that the right to register a "none of the above" vote in elections should apply, and ordered the Election Commission to provide such a button in the electronic [[voting machine]]s, noting that it would increase participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India voters get right to reject election candidates|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-24294995|accessdate=27 September 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SC's landmark judgement: Voters get right to reject|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/130927/news-current-affairs/article/scs-landmark-judgement-voters-get-right-reject|accessdate=27 September 2013|newspaper=Deccan Chronicle|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Voter has right to negative voting: SC|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/voter-has-right-to-negative-voting-sc/article5174414.ece?homepage=true|accessdate=27 September 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Will-implement-voters-right-to-reject-candidates-straight-away-Election-Commission/articleshow/23169193.cms |title=Will implement voters' right to reject candidates straight away: Election Commission |first=Bharti |last=Jain |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=27 September 2013 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/MyIndia-MyVote/Chunk-HT-UI-MyIndiaMyVote-TopStories/Voters-have-right-to-reject-poll-panel-must-give-them-option-says-Supreme-Court/SP-Article10-1127779.aspx |title=Voters have right to reject, poll panel must give them option, says Supreme Court |accessdate=2013-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927071428/http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/coverage/MyIndia-MyVote/Chunk-HT-UI-MyIndiaMyVote-TopStories/Voters-have-right-to-reject-poll-panel-must-give-them-option-says-Supreme-Court/SP-Article10-1127779.aspx |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Election Commission also clarified that even though votes cast as NOTA are counted, they are considered as invalid votes so they will not change the outcome of the election process.

==Indonesia==
[[File:Tangerang Sample Ballot 2018.jpg|A sample ballot for the uncontested 2018 mayoral elections in [[Tangerang]].|thumb]]
The Indonesian Law 10 of 2016 regulates local elections, and includes provisions for elections in which there is only one candidate. In such cases, the candidate contests the election against a NOTA option (commonly referred to as ''kotak kosong''/empty box), and is declared the winner if they manage to secure a majority of the valid votes. Otherwise, the election will be postponed to the next occurrence; the government of Indonesia appoints an acting office holder until the new election, in which the losing candidate is eligible to stand again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UU Nomor 10 Tahun 2016|url=http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/public/content/jdih/UU_Nomor_10_Tahun_2016.pdf|publisher=Constitutional Court of Indonesia|accessdate=4 May 2018|page=26|language=id|quote=KPU Provinsi atau KPU Kabupaten/Kota menetapkan pasangan calon terpilih pada Pemilihan 1 (satu) pasangan calon sebagaimana dimaksud dalam Pasal 54C, jika mendapatkan suara lebih dari 50% (lima puluh persen) dari suara sah.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
UK electoral counting procedures require that all votes be counted and announced, including 'rejected' votes. 'Rejected votes' are classified into four categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Electoral Commission guide on 'Dealing with doubtful ballot papers'|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/87699/UKPE-doubtfuls-booklet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; protest votes are recorded with others rejected as 'voter's intention uncertain'.

===NOTA UK===
NOTA UK is a voluntary organisation set up in 2010 to campaign for a formal None Of The Above (NOTA) option to be added to ballot papers for all future UK elections. It has made numerous written evidence submissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/consultation-on-a-new-magna-carta/written/15588.html |title=Written evidence submitted by NOTA UK (AMC 49) |website=Data.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the parliamentary Political &amp; Constitutional Reform Committee (PCRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/inquiries/ |title=Political and Constitutional Reform Committee - Inquiries - UK Parliament |website=Parliament.uk |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case for NOTA 'with teeth' i.e.: formalised consequences for the election result in the event of a NOTA 'win' (as opposed to 'faux' NOTA, whereby the next placed candidate takes office anyway as happens in India and elsewhere). As a result of these representations, the PCRC explicitly recommended in its final report on 'voter engagement', published February 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nota-uk.org/2015/02/05/the-nota-campaign-gets-a-massive-boost-from-parliamentary-select-committee |title=NOTA campaign gets massive boost from parliamentary select committee! &amp;#124; None of the Above UK |website=Nota-uk.org |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the next UK government should hold a public consultation before May 2016 solely on inclusion of NOTA on UK ballot papers. This in turn has led to increased support for and awareness of NOTA UK's campaign and its founder, recording artist and music producer [[Jamie Stanley]] (aka: Mailman), being asked to give a number of media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdiG9tCq-BU |title=None of the above campaign is 'essential to the concept of democracy' - Jamie Stanley |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; No public consultation materialised as the incoming Conservative government scrapped the PCRC, effectively disregarding all of its recommendations.

Since 2015, in part thanks to NOTA UK's lobbying, it has been a Green Party of England and Wales policy to get a form of NOTA (RON - Re-Open Nominations) on UK ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2015/11/24/getting-nota-ron-on-all-uk-ballot-papers-now-official-green-party-policy/|title=Getting NOTA on UK ballot papers now official Green Party policy!|author=|date=24 November 2015|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the 2017 UK general election, NOTA UK wrote to the Green party suggesting that they should reword the policy so that, instead of RON, it refers specifically to the more self-explanatory NOTA, and that they should also place the policy centre stage in their next manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2017/04/29/open-letter-to-the-green-party-re-ge-2017/|title=Open Letter to the Green Party re: GE 2017|author=|date=29 April 2017|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Above and Beyond===
[[File:Above and Beyond Party logo.jpg|thumb|right|The party's logo]]
The '''Above and Beyond Party''' was founded in 2015 and fielded eight candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], none of whom were elected. Their sole stated policy was to introduce a "none of the above" option on all UK ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How we intend to force none of the above on to all ballot papers |url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/manifestolong-term-strategy.html |publisher=Above and Beyond Party |accessdate=24 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330030914/http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/manifestolong-term-strategy.html |archivedate=30 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why we must change our political system|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/why-politics-must-change.html|publisher=Above &amp; Beyond|access-date=19 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226135840/http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/why-politics-must-change.html|archivedate=26 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's logo is based on the West African [[Adinkra symbol]] "Aya", "derived from a fern tree which famously grows in difficult-to-survive places", and a symbol of resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About our party logo|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/about-our-party-logo.html|publisher=Above and Beyond Party|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics pointed out that their website and Facebook page at the time indicated that they had policy ideas and a political agenda beyond the single issue of NOTA and appeared to be jumping on the bandwagon of other NOTA campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2014/12/10/open-letter-to-mark-flanagan-notavote-the-nota-party-the-above-beyond-party/|title=Open Letter to Mark Flanagan (Notavote / The NOTA Party / The Above &amp; Beyond Party)|author=|date=10 December 2014|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inception and officers====
The party registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 18 March 2015. The Electoral Commission listed the party leader, nominating officer and campaigns officer as Mark Flanagan and the treasurer was Karen Stanley.&lt;ref name="PP2551"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP2551|title=Registration Summary: The Above and Beyond Party|date=|website=|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party chairman was Michael Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View from the Chair|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/view-from-the-chair|publisher=Above and Beyond Party|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was de-registered by the Electoral Commission on 3 November 2016.&lt;ref name="PP2551" /&gt;

====Electoral history====
Above and Beyond fielded four candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. The candidates stood in [[Clwyd West (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd West]], [[Cheadle (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheadle]], [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Central]] and [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our eight target seats|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/our-eight-target-seats.html|publisher=Above and Beyond Party|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] the party endorsed Carlton Reeve, an independent candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our 2015 General Election candidates |url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/our-candidates-so-far.html |publisher=Above and Beyond Party |accessdate=24 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222180418/http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/our-candidates-so-far.html |archivedate=22 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheffield election candidate to be one of youngest|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/sheffield-election-candidate-to-be-one-of-youngest-1-7100855|accessdate=24 March 2015|work=[[Sheffield Star|The Star]]|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Above and Beyond candidate received 5% or more of the votes cast, therefore all lost their [[deposit (politics)#United Kingdom|deposit]].

====Finance====
The party raised funds partially through "AboveBeyond" music nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhalf|first1=Jim|title=Musicians set to bring political message to the stage|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/leisure/tamusic/11808902.Musicians_set_to_bring_political_message_to_the_stage/|accessdate=24 March 2015|work=[[Telegraph &amp; Argus]]|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No Candidate Deserves My Vote! party===
[[No Candidate Deserves My Vote!]] was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 23 November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=167&amp;frmType=partydetail |work=Electoral Commission |title=No Candidate Deserves My Vote! |access-date=9 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416164111/http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=167&amp;frmType=partydetail |archivedate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The No Candidate Deserves My Vote party's single objective is to introduce a bill to Parliament to have a "none of the above" option added to every local and general election ballot paper of the future. They feel this will allow the UK electorate to exercise their democratic right to vote to say that none of the parties currently represents them, which will encourage their democratic responsibility to turn out to vote. If a candidate wins an election it is the intention to stay as a [[Member of Parliament]] until the change in the law is enacted. Only then will the candidate step down and the party be disbanded.

It is the intention of the party that, if a NOTA gains the majority vote, it should cause an automatic [[by-election]], the idea being that the majority will have given a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in the candidates. If the same candidates stand under the same policies, then the electorate simply votes NOTA until the candidates change their policies to something that the electorate can vote for.

In 2010, Stephen Phillips of [[Stevenage]] ran for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|UK general election]] on behalf of No Candidate Deserves My Vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steveofstevenage.org.uk ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323011710/http://www.steveofstevenage.org.uk/ |date=23 March 2010 }} Steve of Stevenage&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips received 327 votes, or 0.7% of the vote, placing 7th out of 9 candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e43.stm |title=Election 2010 &amp;#124; Constituency &amp;#124; Stevenage |publisher=BBC News |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NOTA party===
The NOTA Party, in recent years also known as Notavote, was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 2 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=867&amp;frmType=partydetail |work=Electoral Commission |title=NOTA |accessdate=2009-07-08 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the intention of the NOTA party to field candidates in every UK parliamentary constituency. The respective NOTA candidates would not have continued in office had they received the most votes, this was merely a mechanism to simulate the recording of a formal NOTA vote. The party was registered as 'NOTA' and not 'None of the Above' as the latter is a prohibited expression regarding registration as a party name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/147/made |title=Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent attempt to re-register the NOTA party in 2014 was blocked by the Electoral Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notauk.org/2014/11/08/nota-banned-as-party-name-by-electoral-commission/ |title='NOTA' banned as party name by Electoral Commission &amp;#124; None of the Above UK |website=Notauk.org |date=2014-11-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the acronym 'NOTA' is as good as the phrase 'None of the Above', the logic being that it would confuse voters into thinking it is possible to cast a formal vote for 'None of the Above' when they would in fact just be voting for another party, albeit one standing on a single issue NOTA platform.

===Zero, None Of the Above===
None Of The Above Zero was a candidate at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] in [[Filton and Bradley Stoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Filton and Bradley Stoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|British parliamentary elections of 2010]], a former boxer changed his name by [[deed poll]] from [[Terry Marsh (boxer)|Terry Marsh]] to "None Of The Above X", in order to run as a parliamentary candidate under that name in the constituency of [[South Basildon and East Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|South Basildon and East Thurrock]]. Claiming that he will not take the seat if he wins, he told BBC Essex: "I don't take it for one moment that it would be a vote for me. [..] I'm doing what I think the Electoral Commission should be doing and what should be on every ballot paper in any electoral process." BBC News reported that, while the Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 stipulates that no political party can be registered in the UK under the name "None of the Above", there is no legislation against a person changing their name by deed poll and appearing on the ballot paper as "None Of the Above".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/essex/8639348.stm Basildon boxer to fight election as 'None Of The Above'], BBC News, (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the event he polled 0.3% of the vote, the lowest of any candidate standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e08.stm |work=BBC News |title=BBC NEWS – Election 2010 – Basildon South &amp; Thurrock East}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another individual changed his name by deed poll to ''None Of The Above'' in order to stand as a candidate in [[Chingford and Woodford Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Chingford and Woodford Green]] in 2010. With the surname ''Above'', he was listed first on the ballot paper in alphabetical order, with all the other candidates listed below.
* The [[South Wales]] Anarchists group has run a campaign urging people to "Vote Nobody" since 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southwalesanarchists.org/ |title=South Wales Anarchists |publisher=South Wales Anarchists |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups worldwide have promoted similar slogans.

==Canada==
No electoral jurisdiction in Canada formally lists "none of the above" as a ballot option. However, in some provincial elections it is effectively possible to vote for "none of the above", by attending the polling station and formally "declining to vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arpacanada.ca/index.php/issuesresearch/canadian-politics/111-voting-for-none-of-the-above |title=Voting for none of the above |publisher=Arpacanada.ca |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These declined votes are actually counted and become part of the electoral record.

A businessman in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]], [[British Columbia]] ran in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 federal election]] in the district of [[Prince George—Bulkley Valley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/HFER/hfer.asp?Language=E&amp;Search=Gres&amp;genElection=36&amp;ridProvince=2&amp;submit1=Search |title=History of Federal Ridings since 1867 |website=Parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Zznoneoff, Thea Bove (Thea Bove Zznoneoff); ballots listing candidates alphabetically by surname, he appeared at the bottom. He came sixth of seven candidates with 0.977 percent of votes cast.

A resident of [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], formerly known as Sheldon Bergson, has legally changed his name to "Above Znoneofthe",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vote-none-of-the-above-byelection-1.3426783 "Voters can pick 'none of the above' thanks to this Whitby-Oshawa byelection candidate"]. [[CBC News]] Toronto, January 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and has registered under that name as a candidate in several provincial and federal [[by-election]]s, most recently the [[By-elections to the 42nd Canadian Parliament#Markham.E2.80.94Thornhill|Markham—Thornhill]] by-election of March 3, 2017. His name order was chosen so that his name would always appear at the bottom of the ballot as "Znoneofthe, Above", although this only works federally as provincial election ballots do not list the candidates in surname order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/meet-above-znoneofthe-the-fringe-candidate-who-keeps-running-in-ontario-by-elections "Meet Above Znoneofthe, the fringe candidate who keeps running in Ontario by-elections"]. ''[[National Post]]'', November 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ontario, the [[None of the Above Party of Ontario]] is a registered political party, although its stated mandate is for its candidates to serve in the legislature as [[independent (politics)|independent]] representatives who reflect the views and interests of their constituents, rather than simply as a "reject all of the candidates" placeholder.

==Norway==
The Norwegian election regulation makes it mandatory to present voters with blank ballots in addition to all of the approved parties and election lists. In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary election of 2013]], 12874 votes, which is 0.45% of the total votes given, were blank.

==None of the Above candidates and parties in other countries==
* In [[Serbia]], None of the above (Ниједан од понуђених одговора, НОПО) is a parliamentary political party, legally formed in 2010, which was mostly popularized on [[Facebook]] and less on other social networking websites. In [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012]] they received 22,905 votes, and thus won one seat in the [[National Assembly of Serbia]].
* Geoff Richardson changed his full name to "Of The Above None" and stood as an independent for the seat of [[Division of Gilmore|Gilmore]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 Australian federal election]]. His name appeared as NONE, Of the Above on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noneoftheabove.com.au/about.htm |title=About |publisher=None Of The Above |date=2007-03-16 |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218052948/http://noneoftheabove.com.au/about.htm |archivedate=18 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010]], a candidate Vasiliy Humeniuk changed his name to [[Vasily Protyvsih]] (Vasily Against-all). "Against all candidates" is the name of the "none of the above" vote used in Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref name=Pres&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/24082/ CEC registers two more candidates for Ukraine's president] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109000658/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/24082/ |date=9 November 2009 }}, [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (November 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/53257/ Three candidates united by disgust with authorities], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 19, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

* David Gatchell of [[Tennessee]] ran for [[Tennessee gubernatorial election, 2002|governor in 2002]] and for [[Tennessee United States Senate election, 2006|Senate in 2006]] as a protest, officially changing his middle name from Leroy to None of the Above.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060720/NEWS0206/607200385]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he got 3,738 votes (0.2 percent).
* For the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 Pakistani general election]], the [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] unilaterally decided that a 'none of the above' box would be available as a voting option on ballot papers.&lt;ref name="tribune" /&gt; However, they subsequently decided against it owing to the short amount of time remaining till the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/531463/ecp-decides-against-introducing-none-of-the-above-vote/ |title=ECP decides against introducing 'none of the above' vote - The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was suggested to the Election Commission by Abid Hassan Manto, a constitutional expert and a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Effective legislation proposed to ensure transparency in general elections|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/498106/effective-legislation-proposed-to-ensure-transparency-in-general-elections/|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=Express Tribune|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elections in South Ossetia]] have an "against all" option.

==Procedures that function like "none of the above"==
Most ballots do not have a formal "none of the above" option, but do have procedures that work in a similar way.

=== Argentina ===

In Argentina casting an envelope without a ballot in a [[ballot box]] counts as a blank vote.

===Poland===
In [[Polish legislative election, 1989|1989 legislative election in Poland]] voters were able to vote against the only candidate running, often from the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]] by crossing out the candidate's name on the ballot.&lt;ref name=JFund&gt;{{cite news|last=Fund|first=John|title='None of the Above' Should Be on the Ballot|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/316376/none-above-should-be-ballot-john-fund|accessdate=12 September 2012|newspaper=National Review|date=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, voters defeated the sitting prime minister and dozens of leading Communists because they failed to get the required majority.&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;

===Re-open Nominations (RON)===
Many students' unions in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Martin Hoscik |url=http://www.mayorwatch.co.uk/caroline-pidgeon-named-as-sole-liberal-democrat-mayoral-hopeful/ |title=Caroline Pidgeon named as sole Liberal Democrat mayoral hopeful — MayorWatch |publisher=Mayorwatch.co.uk |date=2015-08-19 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; use a similar ballot option called 're-open nominations' (RON)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mvcwestsussex.org.uk/glossary.html#RON |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921194115/http://www.mvcwestsussex.org.uk/glossary.html#RON |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-21 |title=Make Votes Count In West Sussex |publisher=Mvcwestsussex.org.uk |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2010-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[instant-runoff voting|IRV]] and [[single transferable vote]] (STV) elections. These include the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[University College Dublin Students' Union|UCD Student's Union]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The difference is that RON is a vote against all candidates in FPTP ([[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]]) and all subsequent candidates in an IRV or STV election.


RON is not strictly a '''none of the above''' candidate in transferable vote elections, as when RON is eliminated during the count its votes are transferred to other candidates if those preferences exist.

===Illegal ballots in ''Robert's Rules of Order''===
The American ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised (RONR)]]'' describes various forms of illegal ballots, which are ballots which do not count for any candidate. Blanks are treated as "scrap paper", and are of no effect, but "unintelligible ballots or ballots cast for an unidentifiable candidate or a fictional character are treated as illegal votes. All illegal votes cast by legal voters… are taken into account in determining the number of votes cast for purposes of computing the majority." RONR always requires a majority for election; thus, casting an illegal ballot or one for a hopeless candidate, whether on the ballot or as a write-in, is equivalent to voting No for all other candidates. "The principle is that a choice has no mandate from the voting body unless approval is expressed by more than half of those entitled to vote and registering any evidence of having some opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title= RONR|edition= 11th|year= 2011|pages= 415-416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.robertsrules.com/interp_list.html#2006_5 |title= RONR Official Interpretations: 2006-5: Ballot Elections: Voting "No" or "None of the Above" |date= |access-date= |website= The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site |publisher= The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
* In the film ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]],'' the protagonist Brewster (played by [[Richard Pryor]]) is required, under certain conditions, to spend 30 million dollars in 30 days. He joins the race for Mayor of [[New York City]] and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for None of the Above. The two major candidates sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, leading to a massive settlement which of course furthers their competitor's goal. Brewster is forced to end his campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a write-in candidate and has to publicly announce that he if he won the mayoralty he wants to decline it but is surprised his "None of the Above" campaign became so popular. Neither candidate wins the election, and a new election with different candidates must be held.
* In the sixth-season episode of ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers|Captain Planet]]'' called "Dirty Politics" three of the Eco-Villains are running for president and kidnap the fourth candidate, who is the most popular. Despite this over seventy percent vote None of the Above resulting in the need for a new election.
* [[L. Neil Smith]]'s novel ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' has an [[alternate history]] in which the [[United States]] becomes a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] state after a successful [[Whiskey Rebellion]] and the overthrowing and execution of [[George Washington]] by firing squad for treason in 1794, where None of the Above (which is always an option on the ballot){{page needed|date=November 2016}} has received the most votes for President of the [[North American Confederacy]] on two occasions. The first time was in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], defeating Lucy Kropotkin and would serve until 1972 as the NAC's 24th President. The second time was in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and again in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] and being elected "President for Life" in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]], serving as the 28th President.
* [[Wavy Gravy]] has run a "[[Nobody for President]]" campaign during several different election years in the United States.

'''''Nudd v Taylor''''',&lt;ref name="Nudd v Taylor"&gt;''Nudd v Taylor'' [http://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2000/QSC00-489.pdf &lt;nowiki&gt;[2000]&lt;/nowiki&gt; QSC 489] (30 August 2000) [[Supreme Court of Queensland|Supreme Court]] (Qld, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[court]] [[legal case|case]], decided in the [[Supreme Court of Queensland]] on 30 August 2000. The case concerned [[Conflict of laws|Australian Private International Law]], specifically giving a [[Queensland]] authority to the application of the [[Mozambique rule|Moçambique rule]].&lt;ref name="Nudd v Taylor"/&gt;

==Facts== &lt;!-- NEED SUMMARIZING --&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[1] The plaintiff and defendant in this matter lived in a de facto relationship for a number of years. The plaintiff has sought declarations of constructive trust in respect of a number of properties in Queensland, as well as a sum of money which is said to have been a loan to the defendant. The defendant has brought a counterclaim in which she seeks a declaration that she is entitled to a proportion of the proceeds of sale of property situated in California, as well as an accounting in relation to other monies, and damages. 

[2] In response the plaintiff has filed a conditional notice of intention to defend, disputing the court's jurisdiction to entertain the counterclaim. By the present application he sought a declaration under Rule 16 of the Uniform Civil Procedures Rules to the effect that there is no jurisdiction in the court to deal with the causes of action pleaded in the counterclaim. Upon the hearing of the application, however, the plaintiff's counsel, Mr Taylor, confined his submissions to the claim in respect of the proceeds of sale of the Californian properties, and couched the relief sought in terms of striking out of the relevant paragraphs, rather than seeking a declaration. 

[3] For the purposes of the present application, the following was common ground. The parties lived together for some seventeen years in the course of the 1980s and 1990s. A number of properties were purchased in Queensland in the name of the defendant. In 1987 they moved to the United States. From 1992 properties were acquired in California. Each of them has been sold. The plaintiff continues to reside in California, while the defendant is resident in New Zealand..&lt;ref name="Nudd v Taylor"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Judgement== &lt;!-- Could be summarised a little --&gt;
[[Catherine Holmes|Holmes J]] in determining whether there could be an exception to the ''Moçambique'' rule applied in regard to the counterclaim, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[15] In the present case, the defendant's claim to a share of the proceeds of sale of the properties in California depends entirely on her ability to demonstrate a beneficial interest in the properties. The outcome of her counterclaim must depend on how that question is determined. Her claim is, in my view, properly described as one which essentially concerns her right to an interest in the properties as the gravamen of her claim. Accordingly, it becomes necessary to consider whether the second exception applies. Clearly enough, the claim involves the assertion of an equitable obligation of a kind which courts have been prepared to enforce notwithstanding a connection with foreign immovables; but what of the situation when the party against whom the obligation is asserted is not within the jurisdiction? &lt;ref name="Nudd v Taylor"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holmes J in determining that a foreign litigant had submitted himself to this jurisdiction stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[21] It is too broad a statement to say that a foreign plaintiff who proceeds in Queensland thereby submits himself to the court's jurisdiction at large. The position, is, in my respect view, correctly stated by Holland J in ''National Commercial Bank v Wimborne'':&lt;ref&gt;''National Commercial Bank v Wimborne'' (1979) 11 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 156 (31 December 1979), [[New South Wales Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|a foreign plaintiff, not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the court, who brings an action in the Court submits himself by {{sic|ecessary}} implication to every matter of counter-claim that would operate as a defence to his action or that would as a set off or cross claim arising out of the same subject matter reduce or extinguish the plaintiffs' claim; and also, at least if he is not a foreign Sovereign, to a counterclaim founded on or directly arising out of the same subject matter as the plaintiffs' claim that would require to be tried in order to do justice between the parties in relation to that subject matter even if it might result in a judgment against the plaintiff on the counterclaim.
His Honour continued,

To what has the plaintiff submitted? The answer to that lies, I think, in a consideration of what the plaintiff has brought to the Court for adjudication. He could not, in my opinion, properly be said to have submitted to claims outside of and independent of the subject matter of his own action.&lt;ref&gt;''National Commercial Bank v Wimborne'' (1979) 11 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 156 at 174.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That case was cited with approval by the New South Wales Court of Appeal in ''Marlborough Harbour Board v Charter Travel Co Ltd''.&lt;ref&gt;''Marlborough Harbour Board v Charter Travel Co Ltd'' (1989) 18 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 223 (1 January 1989), [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Court of Appeal]] (NSW, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, the court was prepared to go somewhat further, deciding that the foreign plaintiff's submission to the jurisdiction extended to a counterclaim which raised a new cause of action, provided that such a cross-claim was founded on or directly arose out of the same subject matter as that of the action. 

To similar effect, the English Court of Appeal in ''Republic of Liberia v Gulf Oceanic Inc''&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of Liberia v Gulf Oceanic'' (1985) 1 Lloyds Rep 539.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that a plaintiff submitted himself to the incidents of his litigation, including liability to a counterclaim properly brought. In that case the plaintiffs had sought a declaration in relation to a contract for the purchase of oil and a resulting arbitration. The defendant's counterclaim for damages for breach of the same contract and tort for wrongful procuring of the breach was permitted to stand, notwithstanding that the foreign defendants could not, in the absence of their own litigation, have been made amenable to the jurisdiction of the court on such an action.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to United States federal Indian law and policy:

'''[[Federal Indian policy]]''' &amp;ndash; establishes the relationship between the United States Government and the Indian Tribes within its borders. The Constitution gives the federal government primary responsibility for dealing with tribes. Law and U.S. public policy related to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have evolved continuously since the founding of the [[United States]]. David R. Wrone argues that the failure of the treaty system was because of the inability of an individualistic, democratic society to recognize group rights or the value of an organic, corporatist culture represented by the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Wrone, "Indian Treaties and the Democratic Idea," ''Wisconsin Magazine of History'' (1986) 70#2 pp 83-106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaties==
[[File:Indiana Indian treaties.svg|thumb|right|250px|Indiana Indian treaties]]
The federal government was in charge of relations with the Indians, and the procedure was to use the treaty making power of the president and the Senate to make formal arrangements. Over 200 treaties were agreed upon by 1840.  Gatlin argues that treaties established a procedure that benefited both parties.  The federal government was primarily interested in guaranteeing that Indian lands did not fall into private hands, and that it handled all negotiations with the tribes.  These negotiations, says Gatlin, strengthened the tribes sense of unity and leadership.  The land sales gave the Indians a steady flow of income, and guarantees of federal financial, medical, and educational aid.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Gatlin, Private Diplomacy to Private Property: States, Tribes and Nations in the Early National Period," ''Diplomatic History '' (1998) 22:1 pp 85-99&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the treaties remain in effect and are of special importance regarding federal recognition of tribal status, hunting and fishing rights, rights to protection of sacred properties, rights to water and minerals, and land claims.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Harmon, ed., ''The Power of Promises: Rethinking Indian Treaties in the Pacific Northwest'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Cleland, ''Faith in Paper: The Ethnohistory and Litigation of Upper Great Lakes Indian Treaties'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Faith-Paper-Ethnohistory-Litigation-Treaties/dp/0472117297/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; The federal courts have a long, continuous history of litigation on these issues. The Supreme Court endorsed the procedure, with over 300 decisions making reference to Indian treaties after 1799.&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Bernholz,  "American Indian treaties and the Supreme Court: A guide to treaty citations from opinions of the United States Supreme Court," ''Journal of Government Information'' (2004) 30#2/3  pp 318-431&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property''', signed in [[Paris]], [[France]], on 20 March 1883, was one of the first [[intellectual property]] [[treaty|treaties]]. It established a Union for the protection of industrial property. The Convention is currently still in force. The substantive provisions of the Convention fall into three main categories: national treatment, [[priority right]] and common rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/paris/summary_paris.html |title=Summary of the Paris Convention |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=2014-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2017}}

=== National treatment ===
According to Articles 2 and 3 of this treaty, juristic and natural persons who are either national of or domiciled in a state party to the Convention shall, as regards the protection of industrial property, enjoy in all the other countries of the Union, the advantages that their respective laws grant to nationals.

In other words, when an applicant files an application for a patent or a trademark in a foreign country member of the Union, the application receives the same treatment as if it came from a national of this foreign country. Furthermore, if the intellectual property right is granted (e.g. if the applicant becomes owners of a patent or of a registered trademark), the owner benefits from the same protection and the same legal remedy against any infringement as if the owner was a national owner of this right.

=== Priority right ===
The "''Convention priority right''", also called "''Paris Convention priority right''" or "''Union priority right''", was also established by Article 4 of the Paris Convention, and is regarded as one of the cornerstones of the Paris Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epo.org/law-practice/case-law-appeals/recent/t010015ep1.html|title=Decision T 15/01 (Mystery Swine Disease/SDLO) of 17 June 2004 of Board of Appeal 3.3.01 of the European Patent Office (EPO)|year=2004|at=Reasons for the decision, point 32|quote=The right of priority is generally regarded as one of the cornerstones of the Paris Convention (...)|publisher=European Patent Office|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides that an applicant from one contracting State shall be able to use its first filing date (in one of the contracting State) as the effective filing date in another contracting State, provided that the applicant, or his successor in title, files a subsequent application within 6 months (for [[industrial design]]s and trademarks) or 12 months (for patents and [[utility model]]s) from the first filing.

=== Temporary protection for goods shown at some international exhibitions===
Article 11(1) of the Paris Convention requires that the Countries of the Union "grant temporary protection to patentable inventions, utility models, industrial designs, and trademarks, in respect of goods exhibited at official or officially recognized [[international exhibitions]] held in the territory of any of them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=288514#P223_37281 Article 11(1) of the Paris Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

If a patent or trademark registration is applied for during the temporary period of protection, the priority date of the application may be counted "from the date of introduction of the goods into the exhibition" rather than from the date of filing of the application, if the temporary protection referred to in Article 11(1) has been implemented in such a manner in national law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=288514#P223_37281 Article 11(2) of the Paris Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodenhausen-p150"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodenhausen|first=G.H.C.|authorlink=Georg Bodenhausen|title=Guide to the Application of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property As Revised at Stockholm in 1967|url=http://www.wipo.int/freepublications/en/intproperty/611/wipo_pub_611.pdf|accessdate=28 December 2016|year=1969|publisher=United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property (BIRPI)|page=150|isbn=92-805-0368-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, other means for the Countries of the Union to implement in their national law the temporary protection provided for in Article 11 of the Paris Convention:

{{quote|It is also possible, for example, in the case of exhibited patentable inventions, to make provision for temporary protection by other means, namely, by prescribing that, during a certain period, such exhibition will not destroy the [[novelty (patent)|novelty]] of the invention and that the person who exhibits the invention will also be protected against usurpation of his invention by third parties. Still another possibility of protection consists in the recognition of a [[right of prior use]] in favor of the exhibitor as against possible rights acquired by third parties.&lt;ref name="Bodenhausen-p150"/&gt;}}

=== Mutual independence of patents and trademarks in the different Countries of the Union===
According to Articles 4bis and 6 (for patents and trademarks respectively), for foreigners, the application for a patent or the registration of a trademark shall be determined by the member state in accordance with their national law and not by the decision of the country of origin or any other countries. Patent applications and trademark registrations are independent among contracting countries.

== History ==
After a diplomatic conference in Paris in 1880, the Convention was signed in 1883 by 11 countries: Belgium, Brazil, France, Guatemala, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, El Salvador, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland. Guatemala, El Salvador and Serbia denounced and reapplied the convention via accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?country_id=ALL&amp;start_year=ANY&amp;end_year=ANY&amp;search_what=C&amp;treaty_id=2 |title=Contracting Parties to the Paris Convention |publisher=WIPO |accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treaty was revised at [[Brussels]], Belgium, on 14 December 1900, at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], United States, on 2 June 1911, at [[The Hague]], Netherlands, on 6 November 1925, at London, United Kingdom, on 2 June 1934, at [[Lisbon]], Portugal, on 31 October 1958, and at [[Stockholm]], Sweden, on 14 July 1967, and was amended on 28 September 1979.

[[File:Persecución del Chancho.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Pig wrestling in [[Chile]].]]
'''Pig wrestling''' (also known as '''pig scramble'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=kqcIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o0IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3773,1040222&amp;dq=pig-scramble&amp;hl=en|title=Pig Scramble Is Fun, Profitable|date=22 September 1950|work=Ludington Daily News|accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the variants '''hog wrestling''' and '''greased pig catching''') is a type of game sometimes played at [[agricultural show]]s such as [[State fair|state]] and [[county fair]]s, in which contestants, usually children or young adults, try to grab a slippery [[Domestic pig|pig]]. In the most common version of the game, a team of four members chases a domestic pig around a fenced-off [[mud]] pit and attempts to place it in a barrel, in a race against the clock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinedaleonline.com/news/2005/08/PigWrestlingSublette.htm Pig Wrestling-Sublette County Fair 2005 - Pinedale, Wyoming]&lt;/ref&gt; In some events the pigs are [[wikt:grease|grease]]d with vegetable or mineral oil in order to make catching the pig more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://loudounextra.washingtonpost.com/news/2007/jul/26/greased-pig-scramble-evenings-big-draw/ |title=Greased Pig Scramble Is Evening’s Big Draw |date=26 July 2007 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012095002/http://loudounextra.washingtonpost.com/news/2007/jul/26/greased-pig-scramble-evenings-big-draw/ |archivedate=12 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

Rules vary depending on the venue. Some contests use larger pigs, while others use those that are smaller. Some include a single pig, while others use more than one. The pigs are coated with shortening, vegetable oil, lard, or another lubricant. Contestants chase the pigs around a field or other determined area. Depending on the contest, contestants either try to get one or both hands on the pig, tackle and hold the pig down, or drag the pig to a set point. There may be several rounds per contest. The prize for winning is often the pig itself.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/09/04/Pasco/Pig_catching_rubs_som.shtml Pasco: Pig catching rubs some the wrong way]&lt;/ref&gt;

Children too young to compete in pig wrestling may compete in a greased pig chase, the object of which is to hang onto a greased pig for a certain amount of time. A more juvenile pig is often used for this competition.

==Animal welfare==
Concerns have been raised by [[animal rights]] organizations that using pigs in this form of entertainment is inhumane,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbaltv.com/news/17564782/detail.html Farm Owner, County At Odds Over Pig Wrestling - Baltimore, Maryland News Story - WBAL Baltimore]&lt;/ref&gt; since the pigs have no choice in the matter of whether they want to wrestle or not.  The wrestling may impose undue emotional stress on the pigs, as evidenced by fearful squealing, and causes physical torsional stress on the pigs' joints. Some fairs have thus eliminated pig wrestling from their events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.therecorddelta.com/V2_news_articles.php?heading=0&amp;page=&amp;story_id=1580 The Record Delta County axes greased pig contest]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Minnesota]], pig wrestling is a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=343.36 Minnesota Statutes 343.36 GREASED PIG CONTESTS AND TURKEY SCRAMBLES]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A variant is shown in ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1998 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' in which a pig dressed to look like a unicorn is released with a valuable gem hung around its neck. The first to capture the pig is allowed to keep the treasure.

The television show [[Family Guy]] parodies this concept with the [[List of characters in Family Guy#Citizens of Quahog|Greased-up Deaf Guy]]; a recurring character that first appears in "[[The Thin White Line]]" as the quarry of a company picnic event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5Am4Xc1axA YouTube - Catch the Greased Up Deaf Guy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[MythBusters]]'', the Build Team investigated the difficulty of catching a greased pig, both with and without technological assistance.

'''Sham marriage in the United Kingdom''' is a form of [[Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom|immigration fraud]] in the UK, primarily London{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, conducted systematically to gain [[British nationality law|British citizenship]] in exchange for short-term financial gain. The fraud is often committed by taking advantage of loopholes in [[Immigration to Europe|EU]] [[United Kingdom immigration law|immigration law]] to circumvent customary immigration procedures. The fraud is investigated mostly by the UK [[Border Force]] and previously by the UK Border Agency.

[[File:Oxford sham marriage - Would-be-bride leaves Oxford register office1.jpg|thumb|right|Sham marriage on 8 June 2010 at Oxford Registry Office]]

==Marriage law in the UK==
The laws applying to British citizenship are the same across all four constituent countries, and are under European Union law; however, the [[Marriage law|laws of marriage]] are not the same across all four constituent countries.

==History==
In 2010 a legal ruling{{What ruling?}} by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR), which administers the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], assisted the incidence of sham marriage in the UK {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Increases in sham marriage were reported in London boroughs such as [[London Borough of Wandsworth|Wandsworth]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8444360.stm January 2010 report]&lt;/ref&gt;. Before 2010, people would need a marriage visa from their own country of origin. 

[[File:Raid Sham marriage offenders taken away.jpg|thumb|right|Offenders are caught in June 2010; the [[wedding reception]] would have to later recommence at the police station]]

==Containment==
Sham marriage in the UK is also investigated, as a whole phenomenon, by [[MigrationWatch UK]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/pdfs/BP8_38.pdf MigrationWatch UK July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The whole phenomenon is the responsibility of [[UK Visas and Immigration]]. The [[Immigration Act 2014]] included language concerning bogus marriages{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}, and sham marriage was also referenced by Section 24 of the [[Immigration and Asylum Act 1999]].

'''Soliman's Water''' was a brand of 16th century cosmetic lotion that was marketed as being able to remove blemishes on the skin, such as [[wart]]s, [[Pimple|spots]] and [[freckle]]s. However, the main ingredient of this lotion was [[mercury (element)|mercury]], so it caused side-effects such as severe damage to the skin and loose teeth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemie.de/lexikon/e/Soliman's_Water Soliman's Water] Encyclopedia of Chemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Treaty of Canton''' ({{zh|中瑞廣州條約}}, {{lang-sv|Fördraget i Kanton}}) was the first treaty made between [[Sweden-Norway]] and the [[Qing Dynasty|Chinese Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Liljevalch, Carl Fredrik. (1848). {{Google books|KBQEAAAAQAAJ|''Chinas handel: industri och Statsforfattning,'' p. 22.|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty was negotiated in March 1847 by [[Carl Fredrik Liljevalch, Sr.|Carl Fredrik Liljevalch]] and [[Qiying]], the [[Viceroy of Liangguang]],&lt;ref&gt;Hofbert, Herman ''et al.'' (1906). "Liljewalch, Carl Fredrik" [http://runeberg.org/sbh/b0055.html ''Svenskt biografiskt handlexikon,'' Vol. II, p. 55]; retrieved 2011-07-15&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the [[unequal treaties]] between Western powers and China that followed the [[First Opium War]].

The treaty was actually never ratified by Chinese representatives, which cast a shadow over the legality of the outcome, but nevertheless went into effect, lasting the following 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;Cassel, Pär. ''Traktaten som aldrig var och fördraget som nästan inte blev - De svensk-norsk–kinesiska förbindelserna 1847–1909*''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
Its terms, similar to the 1844 [[Treaty of Wanghia]] between the [[United States]] and China, provided that Sweden-Norway would have the same privileges in China as other treaty powers, so-called [[most-favored-nation]] status.&lt;ref&gt;Tai, En-Sai. (1918). {{Google books|TlAH9CGEdPcC|''Treaty ports in China (a study in diplomacy),'' p. 161.|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States and [[British Empire]] before it, commercial access was granted to the five [[treaty port]]s of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (Kwangchow), [[Amoy]], [[Fuzhou]], [[Ningbo]] and [[Shanghai]]. This was in stark contrast to previous Western relations with China, when only Canton was open for foreign trade.&lt;br/&gt;
Like other Western countries, extraterritorial rights was given to Sweden-Norway; jurisdiction over citizens of Sweden and Norway in the treaty ports was transferred from China to Sweden-Norway.
The treaty furthermore allowed Sweden-Norway to send consuls to China, and to have its commerce being subjected to fixed tariffs only.
The provisions of the treaty remained in force until the twentieth century, with a new treaty being negotiated in 1908 by Gustav Oscar Wallenberg, three years after the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|dissolution of Sweden-Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2010, the United States implemented the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]]; the law required financial firms around the world to report accounts held by US citizens to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. 
The US on the other hand refused the [[Common Reporting Standard]] set up by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], alongside [[Vanuatu]] and [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name="SwansonApr5" /&gt;

This means the US receives tax and asset information for American [[asset]]s and [[income]] abroad, but does not share information about what happens in the United States with other countries. In other words, it has become attractive as a [[tax haven]].&lt;ref name=BloombergDrucker /&gt;

Despite this, the US [[Public Interest Research Group]] (PIRG) said in 2014 that the [[United States]] loses roughly $184 billion per year due to corporations such as Pfizer, Microsoft and Citigroup using offshore tax havens to avoid paying US taxes. According to PIRG:
*[[Pfizer]] paid no US income taxes 2010–2012, despite earning $43 billion. The corporation received more than $2 billion in federal tax refunds. In 2013, Pfizer operated 128 subsidiaries in tax havens and had $69 billion offshore which could not be collected by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS);
*[[Microsoft]] maintains five tax haven subsidiaries and held $76.4 billion overseas in 2013, thus saving the corporation $24.4 billion in taxes;
*[[Citigroup]] maintained 21 subsidiaries in tax haven countries in 2013, and kept $43.8 billion in offshore jurisdictions, thus saving the corporation an additional $11.7 billion in taxes.&lt;ref name="U.S. PIRG"&gt;{{cite news|title=Picking Up the Tab 2014|url=http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/picking-tab-2014|work=U.S. PIRG|date=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Company''''', 532 U.S. 200 (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co.|volume=532|page=200|pin=|year=2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case that deals with the federal [[tax code]]. The question before the court was “Is back-pay subject to federal taxes under the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Federal Insurance Contributions Act]] and the [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]], based on the year the money should have been paid out?” Carter G. Phillips argued for the respondent and James A. Feldman argued for the petitioner, the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

== Background ==
The [[Cleveland Indians]] Baseball Company owed eight of its players back wages that were due in 1986 and fourteen players back wages that were due in 1987. The company paid the wages in 1994. The company paid taxes on the wages for the 1994 formula. The Company then requested that some of the taxes be refunded by the IRS under the argument that the taxes should be paid based on the year that they were supposed to be paid instead of the year they were actually paid. The taxes would have been significant because the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) which are used to fund [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and Unemployment. The FICA and FUTA were both passed after 1987. The Cleveland Indians used Sixth Court precedent in its argument that late wages are taxed upon the year they should have paid. The District Court bound by precedent ordered the government to return the taxes. The Sixth [[Court of Appeals]] affirmed the District Court’s ruling.

== Opinion of the Court ==
Unlike the Sixth Court of Appeals the court had limited precedent in which to follow. Therefore, the court simply decided to use the IRS’s interpretation of the law. Ginsburg delivering the opinion of the court stated “according due respect to the service’s reasonable, longstanding construction of the governments statues and its own regulations, we hold that back wages are subject to FICA and FUTA taxes by reference to the year the wages are in fact paid.”
