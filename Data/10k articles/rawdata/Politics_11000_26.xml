In the spring of 2015, [[Moldova]] faced large-scale protests amid a worsening economic situation and corruption scandals. The protests gained momentum in September, when up to 100,000 people demonstrated in the largest protest [[Popular Front of Moldova#Grand National Assembly|since Moldova's independence]] from the [[Soviet Union]] in August 1991.

The protests have been organised by a grass-roots citizens' movement, ''[[Dignity and Truth Platform Party|Dignity and Truth]]'' ({{lang-ro|Demnitate și Adevăr}}), that was established in February 2015 as a response to the disappearance of [[Moldovan bank fraud scandal|$1 billion from the Moldovan banks in 2014]].&lt;ref name=bbc14915/&gt; Dignity and Truth is led by lawyers, journalists and other well-known figures in Moldova.&lt;ref name=bbc14915/&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Unification of Romania and Moldova|Moldovan bank fraud scandal}}
In Moldova, one of [[Europe]]'s poorest countries,&lt;ref name="EUbusiness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/europe/moldova/factfile|title=Moldova: One of Europe's poorest lands|work=EUbusiness|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 17% of the population live below the [[poverty line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr14-report-en-1.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2014 |work=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with an average wage of about $129 per month, Moldova reportedly has the lowest standard of living in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iC_VBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA945&amp;lpg=PA945&amp;dq=moldova+has+lowest+standard+of+living&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=S7LZSLI2Ty&amp;sig=_KzkLanIonl4qr6ky5di2s8ZVHM&amp;hl=ro&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMIi_LFh674xwIVSbIUCh1ITAi5#v=onepage&amp;q=moldova%20has%20lowest%20standard%20of%20living&amp;f=false|title=Political Handbook of the World 2014|editor-last=Lansford|editor-first=Thomas|publisher=CQ Press|page=945|date=15 April 2014|isbn=978-1-4833-3328-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, $1 billion vanished from three of Moldova's leading banks.&lt;ref name=bbc18615&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33166383 The great Moldovan bank robbery], [[BBC News]] (18 June 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In two days loans worth $1 billion were transferred in to [[United Kingdom]] and [[Hong Kong]]-registered companies whose ultimate owners are unknown.&lt;ref name=bbc18615/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34445201 The billion-dollar ex-council flat], [[BBC News]] (7 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Banks are administered by the [[National Bank of Moldova]], so this loss was covered from state reserves.&lt;ref name=bbc18615/&gt; This protected depositors but created a hole in Moldovan public finances equivalent to an eighth of the country's [[GDP]].&lt;ref name=bbc18615/&gt; Protesters claim this damaged their living standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34240239 Thousands join Moldova anti-government protest], [[BBC News]] (13 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue highlighted the problem of corruption in Moldova and although the government has promised an investigation, protest leaders have called for a campaign of [[civil disobedience]], a [[general strike]] and a refusal to pay utility bills in order to force the resignation of the government. Likewise, as a response to the $1 billion disappearance the grass-roots citizens' movement ''Dignity and Truth'' ({{lang-ro|Dreptate și Adevăr}}) was established in February 2015.&lt;ref name=bbc14915/&gt;  This organization is led by lawyers, journalists and other well-known figures in Moldova.&lt;ref name=bbc14915/&gt;

[[Unification of Romania and Moldova|Unification with Romania]] is seen{{By whom|date=December 2015}} as a solution to Moldova's economic, political and social crisis, but also in the context of the [[Ukrainian crisis|tensions in neighbouring]] [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="Mallinder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/moldova-stuck-in-limbo-between-its-east-and-west-1.2243253 |title=Moldova stuck in limbo between its east and west |work=The Irish Times |last=Mallinder |first=Lorraine |date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls up to May 2015 showed 10 to 20 percent of Moldovans supported unification.&lt;ref name=rfem2015/&gt;

===Name===
The protests are dubbed in the international press as the '''Moldovan [[Euromaidan|Maidan]]''' (due to similar circumstances with Ukrainian Euromaidan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voxeurop.eu/en/content/news-brief/4927218-moldovan-maidan|title=Anti-corruption protests in Chişinău: A Moldovan Maidan?|work=VoxEurop.eu|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/ro/maidan-pa%C8%99nic-la-chi%C8%99in%C4%83u-demonstra%C8%9Bie-de-amploare-%C3%AEmpotriva-guvernan%C8%9Bilor/a-18697205|title="Maidan" pașnic la Chișinău: demonstrație de amploare împotriva guvernanților|work=Deutsche Welle|last=Călugăreanu|first=Vitalie|date=7 September 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Anti-oligarchic movement'''.&lt;ref name="jurnal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurnal.md/en/politic/2015/9/7/saakashvili-protests-from-chisinau-an-anti-oligarchic-movement-moldovans-are-sick-of-clans-and-corruption/|title=Saakashvili: "Protests from Chişinău – an anti-oligarchic movement; Moldovans are sick of clans and corruption"|work=Jurnal.md|date=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jamestown.org/regions/europe/moldova/|title=Toppling Moldova’s Government: Popular Movement or Political Operation?|last=Socor|first=Vladimir|publicationdate=9 September 2015|volume=12|issue=161|publisher=Eurasia Daily Monitor|journal=The Jamestown Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Moldova, media outlets cataloged the events as a '''Red Revolution''', due to involvement of communist and socialist parties in the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unimedia.info/stiri/revolutia-rosie--dupa-ce-au-blocat-centrul-capitalei--dodon-si-usatii-vor-sa-paralizeze-drumurile-nationale-101987.html|title=Revoluția roșie.

===Protesters' profile===
The protesters have formed two distinct camps: pro-European sympathizers and those who support pro-Russian parties. But while they may be separated by aspirations and ideologies, both sides have similar aims: the resignation of the government, the conviction of corrupt oligarchs and early elections.&lt;ref name="ibtimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/moldovas-maidan-echoes-ukraine-crisis-amid-anti-corruption-protest-movement-1523124|title=Moldova's Maidan: Echoes of Ukraine crisis amid anti-corruption protest movement|work=International Business Times|date=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those in the pro-Russian camp, the corruption cases have provoked a crisis of confidence in the European project.&lt;ref name="ibtimes" /&gt; Moldova signed an association agreement with the [[European Union]] in 2013, committing to core reforms, economic recovery, sector cooperation and justice, but anti-European sentiment is growing. An April 2015 poll found that 32% of Moldovans favoured joining the EU, a decrease of 46 percent compared to 78% in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/externe/ue-pare-sa-piarda-lupta-cu-rusia-pentru-republica-moldova-14311781|title=UE pare să piardă lupta cu Rusia pentru Republica Moldova|work=Mediafax|last=Enache|first=Iuliana|date=21 May 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline ==

=== Farmers' protests ===
The National Farmers Federation of Moldova, the Republican Association ''UniAgroProtect'', the National Farmers Federation ''AGROinform'' and the Association ''Moldova-Fruct'' organized on 27 March and 15 April protest action by farmers throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agora.md/stiri/8134/fermierii-ameninta-cu-blocarea-tuturor-intrarilor-in-chisinau |title=Fermierii amenință cu blocarea tuturor intrărilor în Chișinău|work=Agora|date=27 April 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to organizers, the protests mobilized more than 5,000 farmers. They blocked national roads with agricultural machinery.

Farmers oppose a VAT increase from 8% to 20% and demand swift access to a credit line of nearly €100 million offered by [[Poland]] with a subsidized interest rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stiri.tvr.ro/mii-de-fermieri-din-republica-moldova-au-protestat-cu-utilajele-pe-drumurile-nationale_58400.html|title=Mii de fermieri din Republica Moldova au protestat cu utilajele pe drumurile naţionale|work=Ştirile TVR|date=27 March 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers say that, because of the devaluation of the [[Moldovan leu|leu]], resulting from ''de facto'' nationalization of the banks at the heart of the economic crisis, they can't service outstanding loans. They had several meetings with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Finance, but were not satisfied with the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europalibera.org/content/article/26924326.html|title=Mii de fermieri au protestat în R.

=== 5 April demonstration ===
[[File:Protestul Platformei „DA” (5 aprilie 2015) (2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Protest of DA Platform in Chișinău, on 5 April]]
Tens of thousands of people across the country gathered in downtown Chișinău, at the call of the ''Dignity and Truth'' Platform, in an action of protest against the collapse of the financial and banking system, but also against judicial corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jurnal.md/ro/social/2015/4/5/proteste-de-amploare-la-chisinau-mii-de-oameni-au-scandat-hotii-de-la-guvernare-la-puscarie/ |title=Proteste de amploare la Chişinău; Mii de oameni au scandat: "Hoţii de la guvernare, la puşcărie!"|work=Jurnal.md|date=5 April 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demonstrators chanted slogans against the government led by [[Chiril Gaburici]] and demanded the unification of Romania and Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Extern/Europa/Protest+Chisinau+Republica+Moldova+violente+7+aprilie+2009|title=Mii de persoane au protestat la Chişinău, la şase ani de la violenţele din aprilie 2009|work=Digi24|date=5 April 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaburici resigned on 22 June after an investigation into alleged fraud in his educational qualifications and was replaced permanently by [[Valeriu Streleț]] on 30 July.

On 3 May, up to 50,000 people protested against the [[Government of Moldova]], saying it had failed to implement reforms to bring the country closer to the [[European Union]]. Protesters also called on the government to investigate the disappearance of $1 billion (nearly 1/8 of the country's GDP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/05/05/kiev-ukraine-moldova-globalpost/26923909/ |title=Someone stole $1B from Moldova — an eighth of its GDP |work=USA Today |last=Peleschuk |first=Dan |date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/moldovas-missing-1bn-sparks-protests-against-countrys-government-10231115.html |title=Moldova's missing $1bn sparks protests against country's government |work=The Independent |last=O'Connor |first=Roisin |date=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the state-owned Savings Bank and the private banks ''Unibank'', ''Banca de Economii'' and ''Banca Socială'', in November 2014 before [[Moldovan parliamentary election, 2014|parliamentary elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-bank-scandal-economy/26973772.html |title=Moldova's Missing Millions: Massive Bank Scandal Roils Chisinau |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |last=Baker |first=Mark |date=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central bank commissioned risk consultancy [[Kroll Inc.|Kroll]] to conduct a preliminary investigation into the activities of the three stricken banks.

A protest took place on 14 May, in [[Bucharest]], in front of the Embassy of the Republic of Moldova, calling for an "urgent revocation of abusive measures" taken by the Chișinău authorities against Romanian citizen George Simion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/protest-fata-de-expulzarea-lui-george-simion-din-r--moldova-378421 |title=Protest faţă de expulzarea lui George Simion din R.

Romanian Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]] conducted a visit to Chișinău on the occasion of Moldovan Independence Day, being greeted by about 200 young men with masks featuring George Simion. "We want to see justice done in the case of George Simion, we want functional justice and we believe that true sovereignty, independence and freedom can only be achieved through union", stated Anatol Ursu, one of the organizers of the [[flash mob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evzmd.md/politica/268-politic/26465-ponta,-intampinat-la-chi%C8%99inau-intr-un-mod-inedit.html |title=Ponta, întâmpinat la Chișinău într-un mod inedit |work=Evenimentul Zilei |last=Moraru |first=Anatol |date=27 August 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== March of Stephen the Great ===
[[File:Potential union of Romania and Moldova including Transnistria.png|thumb|200px|Unified Romania, including [[Transnistria]], as envisaged by unionists]]
On 5 July 2015, up to 30,000 people, according to organizers, gathered in Grand National Assembly Square, [[Chișinău]], facing Government House and the [[Monument to the Victims of the Soviet Occupation]], to demand the unification of Romania and Moldova. Participants chanted unionist slogans and voted symbolically for a union. Organized by Unionist Platform "Action 2012" and Youth of Moldova, the manifestation was claimed to be one of the largest in the recent history of Moldova and the fourth great national gathering after those of 27 August 1989 (calling for a restoration of the [[Latin script]]), 16 December 1990 (in support of changing the name of the state to [[Republic of Moldova]]) and 27 August 1991 (celebrating the [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|proclamation of independence]] from the [[USSR]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adevarul.ro/moldova/actualitate/livetext-video-zi-istorica-republica-moldova-chisinau-moldovenii-cer-unirea-romania-1_5598e541f5eaafab2c415a44/index.html |title=Zi istorică pentru Republica Moldova.

Thousands of young people among the participants in the Great National Gathering headed to [[Bucharest]] in the '''March of Stephen the Great''' ({{lang-ro|Marșul lui Ștefan cel Mare}}) calling for the unification of Moldova with Romania. The march lasted a week, from 5 to 11 July.

=== Political crisis ===

On 13 January 2016, 56 deputies of the parliamentary coalition formed around PD proposed controversial businessman [[Vlad Plahotniuc]] for the position of prime minister. The proposal was immediately rejected by President [[Nicolae Timofti]], invoking integrity reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Extern/Europa/O+noua+zi+tensionata+la+Chisinau |title=Chișinău.

However, Ion Păduraru announced his withdrawal from the race in less than 24 hours after the announcement of his nomination. He justified his gesture by the fact that the parliamentary majority has already nominated another proposal of premier, and President Timofti will consider it as a compromise solution. On 16 January, the parliamentary coalition grouped around the Democratic Party of Vlad Plahotniuc announced that disagrees with the proposal of President Timofti and came up with a new proposal for premier, instead of Plahotniuc – [[Pavel Filip]]. Later that day, up to 20,000 people joined three different rallies that were organized by both the left [[Socialist Party of Moldova]] and the centre-right Civic Platform DA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/news/329210-tens-thousands-protest-moldova/ |title=Tens of thousands protest in Moldova calling for snap elections |work=RT |date=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters called on the Moldovan president and chief prosecutor to resign, demanding early elections and prompt measures against corruption. They also opposed the nomination of Pavel Filip to the post of Prime Minister.

On 20 January, a majority of 57 MPs voted in favor of PD-backed Pavel Filip Government. During the parliamentary meeting, the Parliament building was surrounded by about 1,000 protesters that demanded the interruption of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/international/parlamentul-din-r-moldova-voteaza-astazi-echipa-guvernamentala-a-premierului-desemnat-pavel-filip-lista-ministrilor.html |title=Proteste violente la Chisinau.

=== Renewed protests ===
Thousands of people calling for Moldova's reunification with Romania took to the streets of Chișinău on 27 March in a so-called "march of reunion". The rally organizers say some 50,000 people took part in the protests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandul.info/stiri/mars-de-amploare-in-chisinau-pentru-unirea-cu-romania-15158121 |title=Marş de amploare în Chişinău, pentru unirea cu România |work=Gândul |author=Roxana Măciucă |date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while police put the number at 5,000–6,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova-rally-romania-unification/27638163.html |title=Thousands In Moldova Rally For Unification With Romania |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally was meant to mark the 98th anniversary since  [[Bessarabia]] was unified with the [[Kingdom of Romania]] on 27 March 1918. A bomb alert was triggered at Nicolae Sulac National Palace, during the formation of platform ''Sfatul Țării 2'', that brings together the unionist organizations in Moldova fighting for the unification with Romania. Sappers and firefighters were deployed on the spot, but found that the alarm was false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/externe/alerta-cu-bomba-la-chisinau-in-timpul-constituirii-platformei-care-reuneste-organizatiile-unioniste-15157841 |title=Alertă cu bombă la Chişinău în timpul constituirii platformei care reuneşte organizaţiile unioniste |work=Mediafax |author=Roxana Măciucă |date=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of Voievod Movement held a counter manifestation.

====2017====
On 11 June 2017 a new protest took place at Chișinău: around 4.000 citizens took part at a protest against adopting a law of mixed voting system, promoted by the [[Democratic Party of Moldova]], seen by the [[Venice Commission]] and European rights experts as inappropriate for Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-moldova-election-protests/in-moldova-thousands-protest-over-proposed-voting-changes-idUSKBN1920UV|title=In Moldova, thousands protest over proposed voting changes|date=11 June 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/international/proteste-in-r-moldova-24-000-de-oameni-au-iesit-in-strada-pentru-a-se-opune-unui-proiect-de-reforma-a-sistemului-electoral.html|title=Proteste in R.

On 16 October, the [[National Bank of Moldova]] has withdrawn the licenses of financial activity for Savings Bank, Social Bank and Unibank.

== Reactions ==

=== Domestic ===
[[Igor Dodon]], leader of the country's largest opposition party, the influential [[Moscow]]-friendly [[Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova|Socialist Party]], has denounced the government's silence toward what he described as "officials and representatives of right-wing extremist, nationalist and "neo-Nazi" groups from Romania who attended the 5 July gathering.&lt;ref name="eurasia" /&gt;

After a first meeting with the leaders of the protesters, Moldovan PM [[Valeriu Streleț]] stated that his government would resign only in case of a [[Motion of no confidence|no-confidence vote]] in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romaniatv.net/proteste-la-chisinau-guvernul-demisioneaza-numai-in-cazul-unui-vot-de-neincredere-dat-de-parlament_243898.html |title=Proteste la Chişinău: Guvernul demisionează numai în cazul unui vot de neîncredere dat de Parlament |work=omânia TV |date=10 September 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a message published on the Presidency page, [[Nicolae Timofti]] cataloged the 6 September demonstration as a democratic exercise. As for his resignation, Timofti said he won't resign because "such a decision would bring instability to the Republic of Moldova".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moldova24.info/2015/09/reactia-lui-timofti-in-legatura-cu-protestele-din-tara-nu-voi-demisiona/ |title=REACȚIA lui Timofti în legătură cu protestele din țară: Nu voi demisiona |work=Moldova24 |date=9 September 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dorin Chirtoacă]], Mayor of Chișinău, pressure from society must exist, but organizers of protests should correctly calculate their forces and actions. He also stated that eventual early elections would further destabilize the situation in Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trm.md/ro/politic/chirtoaca-anticipatele-ar-destabiliza-situatia-din-republica-moldova/ |title=Chirtoacă: Anticipatele ar destabiliza situaţia din Republica Moldova |work=TeleRadio Moldova |date=14 September 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar position was adopted by Moldova's parliament speaker, [[Andrian Candu]], saying such a move would leave the country stuck in economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34242511 |title=Early Moldova elections 'would be catastrophic' |work=BBC News |date=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the September protests, Dorin Chirtoacă has called for the tents to be removed from the central boulevard and claimed that not only is the protest illegal, but that it is being fomented by [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unian.info/world/1150999-chisinaus-mayor-accuses-russian-security-officials-of-orchestrating-protests-in-moldova.html |title=Chisinau's Mayor accuses Russian security officials of orchestrating protests in Moldova |work=UNIAN |date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has claimed that Renato Usatîi and [[Igor Dodon]] are puppets of [[Vladimir Putin]].

=====States=====
* {{flagicon|Romania}} Romanian Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]] expressed his concern about the situation in Moldova, that, in his opinion, is "worse than last year", but says that he supports his counterpart in Chișinău and Moldova's European course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ziare.com/victor-ponta/premier/ponta-ingrijorat-de-protestele-din-moldova-sa-nu-ne-trezim-cu-primari-prorusi-la-chisinau-si-balti-1361448 |title=Ponta, ingrijorat de protestele din Moldova: Sa nu ne trezim cu primari prorusi la Chisinau si Balti |work=Ziare.com |date=4 May 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ponta is a vocal supporter of Romania's reunification. In September 2014, he gave a speech at [[Alba Iulia]], stating that "my commitment is to jointly make a second Great Union of Romania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandul.info/stiri/reactia-rusiei-dupa-afirmatiile-lui-victor-ponta-privind-unirea-cu-republica-moldova-13279877 |title=Reacţia Rusiei după afirmaţiile lui Victor Ponta privind unirea cu Republica Moldova |work=Gândul |last=Drăghici |first=Mihai |date=16 September 2014 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a meeting of the Presidents of Romania and Moldova in [[Suceava]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/moldovan-romanian-presidents-support-moldova-joining-eu-131016170.html |title=Moldovan, Romanian presidents support Moldova joining EU |work=Yahoo!

:On 26 January 2016, the [[Government of Romania]] offered a €60 million loan to help stave off economic collapse. To get the money, Prime Minister [[Dacian Cioloș]] said Moldova will have to reform its justice system, fight corruption, sign a draft agreement for a loan from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and appoint a new central bank governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_ROMANIA_MOLDOVA?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=Romania offers Moldova $65 million loan to spur reforms |work=AP |author=Alison Mutler |date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|United States}} According to the [[United States]] Embassy in Chișinău, protests highlight the frustration experienced by many Moldovans due to lack of reforms in their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unimedia.info/stiri/Reacia-Ambasadei-Statelor-Unite-la-Chiinau-privind-protestele-din-PMAN-100736.html |title=Reacția Ambasadei Statelor Unite la Chișinău privind protestele din PMAN |work=Unimedia |date=10 September 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; American diplomats support the right of citizens to protest peacefully, urging Moldova's Government to quickly implement the necessary reforms, such as expanding anti-corruption efforts.

====Others====
* {{flagicon|United States}} According to [[Stratfor]], protests could threaten the stability of Moldova's fragile government. Consequently, the possible weakening or collapse of the Moldovan government "could slow Moldova's European integration".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/protests-threaten-moldovas-fragile-government|title = Protests Threaten Moldova's Fragile Government|date = 15 May 2015|accessdate = |website = Stratfor|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar analysis from Stratfor shows that "the recent rallies and the positive reaction from top Romanian officials are signs of increasing Romanian influence in Moldova".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/moldovas-instability-could-be-romanias-opportunity |title=Moldova's Instability Could Be Romania's Opportunity |work=Stratfor |date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{flagicon|Georgia}}/{{flagicon|Ukraine}} Former Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], now Governor of Ukrainian [[Odessa Oblast]], considers that protests taking place in Chișinău are "an anti-oligarchic movement which answers Ukraine's aspirations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://independent.md/saakasvili-despre-protestele-de-la-chisinau-oamenii-au-obosit-de-coruptie-si-clanuri-oligarhice/#.VfZYQX2LWA5 |title=Saakașvili, despre protestele de la Chișinău: "Oamenii au obosit de corupție și clanuri oligarhice" |work=Independent.md |date=7 September 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is known that, in recent years, Moldovan oligarchs began to control everything. They control all state bodies, most of the Parliament and almost entirely the premier. When former prime minister [Chiril Gaburici] tried to change something, was immediately put on the table a file with compromising materials. This is a typical oligarchic style", concluded Saakashvili.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cotidianul.ro/saakasvili-isi-da-cu-parerea-despre-protestele-de-la-chisinau-267687/ |title=Saakaşvili îşi dă cu părerea despre protestele de la Chişinău |work=Cotidianul |date=7 September 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Saakashvili deems "the people come out on street to protest against oligarchs, but not in the favor of Russia. I think that the whole population of the Republic of Moldova is for Europe, and among youth it is an absolute majority".&lt;ref name="jurnal" /&gt;
* {{flagicon|Russia}} In an article published by the news agency [[RIA Novosti]], President of the Center for Systematic Analysis and Forecasting in [[Moscow]], Rostislav Ishchenko, says that events in the Republic of Moldova remind of the [[Orange Revolution|"orange" scenario]]. According to the author, all [[Color revolutions|"colored" coups]] were organized and guided by the [[United States]], and the embassies were coordination centres for protesters, scenario also "applied" in Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://independent.md/presa-rusa-protestele-de-la-chisinau-sunt-dirijate-de-sua/#.VfZbkn2LWA4 |title=Presa rusă: Protestele de la Chișinău sunt dirijate de SUA |work=Independent.md |date=12 September 2015 |language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Russian analyst writes that "rumors that make connections between protesters and EU, particularly [[Germany]], country from where would be financed the DJ Platform, are identical to those linking the [[Euromaidan|protests in Kiev]] and financiers in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ria.ru/analytics/20150910/1241698462.html#ixzz3lQNd37Md |title=Ситуация в Молдове и выбор США |work=RIA Novosti |date=10 September 2015 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded by [[Richard Barbrook]] and [[Fabian Tompsett]] in 2007, the group has since reproduced [[Guy Debord|Guy Debord's]] ''[[Le Jeu de la Guerre]]'' and proceeded to tour Europe, Asia and South America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.classwargames.net/&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the electronic version of Debord's game, created by the Radical Software Group,&lt;ref&gt;http://r-s-g.org/kriegspiel/about.php&lt;/ref&gt; Class Wargames is based on a real rather than digital version of the Game of War and allows for convivial interaction through which anyone can become a [[situationist]].&lt;ref&gt;http://networkcultures.org/blog/2016/04/04/how-to-be-modern-a-situationist-social-democrats-adventures-in-radio-gaming-and-the-internet/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">'''DontGo''' (also commonly spelled in numerous other ways such as '''Don't Go''', '''DontGO''', and '''Don'tGO''') is a [[free market]] [[political activist]] [[non-profit organization|non-profit group]] founded by [[American conservative]] [[Patrick Ruffini]], who had previously created the [[blog]] ''The Next Right'', and [[libertarianism|libertarian]] Eric Odom, an [[marketer|internet marketer]] living in [[Chicago, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=TV&gt;[http://www.pjtv.com/?cmd=page&amp;page-id=167 The Tea Party Coalition Show]. [[Pajamas TV]]. Accessed April 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

==History==
The group started during the August 2008 [[United States offshore drilling debate|offshore oil drilling debate]] in the [[United States House|House of Representatives]], their members strongly favored further drilling and supported the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] revolt on the issue. Founders Odom and Ruffini intended for their website to work as a [[wikt:clearing house|clearinghouse]] of information for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/05/conservative-online-activists-launch-dont-go-web-site/ Conservative online activists launch '#dont Go' Web site]. By Martina Stewart. [[CNN.com]] Published August 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=who/&gt; The name came from conservatives who had asked the [[United States House|House]] not to shut down for their annual summer break in 2008.&lt;ref name=TV/&gt; Critics of the group accused it of taking contributions from [[Big Oil|oil companies]]. Eric Odom strongly disputes the charges, saying that he's "still waiting on those magical checks".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dontgomovement.com/blog/2009/04/10/is-the-tea-party-tied-to-the-gop/ Is the Tea Party tied to the GOP?] By Eric Odom. [http://www.dontgomovement.com/blog/ DontGo Blog]. Posted April 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Odom has stated that "Our agenda is to declare war on incumbency and long term power.&lt;ref name=who/&gt; The group's mission statement on its website labels it "for anyone who supports free markets, low-taxes, low-regulation and personal freedoms."&lt;ref name=ob&gt;[http://www.dontgomovement.com/objective/ Objective]. [http://www.dontgomovement.com/ dontgomovement.com] Accessed April 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Three national conservative groups, DontGo, [[FreedomWorks]], and [[Americans for Prosperity]] led the tea party movement in April, 2009, according to ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine, which referred to DontGo as a "tech savvy" "online rapid response team".&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

==Projects==
The group is instrumental in co-coordinating the [[Nationwide Chicago Tea Party]], which led to the [[Tax Day Tea Party]] protests. It claims to have worked with 700 separate demonstrations. Odom, a [[Bob Barr]] supporter with [[libertarianism|libertarian leanings]], opposes too much [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] involvement with their protests. Notably, he turned down a request from [[Republican National Committee]] Chairman [[Michael Steele]] to speak at the group's Chicago protest.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2009/04/the-tea-party-movement-whos-in-charge/13041/ The Tea Party Movement: Who's In Charge?] By Chris Good. ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]''. Posted April 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After the snub, the [[Republican National Committee]] released a statement saying that "They're just having a little fun."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2009/4/10/gop-chairman-michael-steele-denies-tea-party-claim.html GOP Chairman Michael Steele Denies Tea Party Claim].

'''Edible tableware''' is [[tableware]], such as plates, [[drinkware]] and glasses, [[List of eating utensils|utensils]] and [[cutlery]], that is [[Eating|edible]].&lt;ref name="Richardson 2008"/&gt; Edible tableware can be homemade&lt;ref name="Somov 2008"/&gt; and has also been [[Mass production|mass-produced]] by some companies, and can be prepared using many various foods.

==Overview==
[[File:Ethiopian_food.jpg|thumb|left|[[Injera]] bread being used as a utensil to scoop [[Wat (food)|wat]]]]
Edible tableware can be homemade and is also [[Mass production|mass-produced]], and is prepared from various foods.&lt;ref name="Somov 2008"/&gt; For example, homemade tableware can be fashioned using sliced celery as chopsticks, and celery can also be used to scoop foods such as dips and cream cheese.&lt;ref name="Damrosch Coleman 2013"/&gt; A leaf of cabbage can be used as a spoon, and a carrot stick that has been sharpened can be used as a skewer.&lt;ref name="Somov 2008"/&gt; Edible bowls and plates can be prepared with many methods. Bread which has had its center removed can be used for soups, and similarly, baking cheese in an oven and forming the cheese into the desired shape.&lt;ref name="Medina 2011"/&gt; Chocolate can also be fashioned into edible tableware.{{efn|"Beyond Yohay's chocolatey edible tableware, retail operators have many choices in using chocolate to its best advantage."&lt;ref name="Fresh Cup 1997"/&gt;}}

[[Flatbread]] such as [[Khubz|khobez]] is sometimes used as an eating utensil, such as when it's used to scoop [[hummus]], and Ethiopian [[injera]] bread is used as a utensil to scoop [[Wat (food)|wat]].&lt;ref name="Holland 2014"/&gt; In West Africa, flatbread is sometimes used to scoop [[fufu]] for consumption.&lt;ref name="Holland 2014"/&gt; In India, [[chapati]] flatbread is used as a utensil to consume [[Sambar (dish)|sambar]] and [[dhal]].&lt;ref name="Singman"/&gt; In Central America, the [[tortilla]] is used as a utensil to scoop various foods such as salsa and bean dips.&lt;ref name="Tatum 2013"/&gt; Foods such as crackers, corn and tortilla chips, [[crudités]], bread and cheese sticks can also be used as edible utensils.&lt;ref name="Brown Fields 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiss 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw Beisch Salvas 2007"/&gt;

==Organisations producing edible cutlery==
* [[Bakeys]] is an Indian manufacturer of edible utensils and cutlery that has aims to reduce plastic utensil [[Plastic pollution|waste]] in India, which has been estimated to consist of approximately 120 billion discarded pieces annually.&lt;ref name="Economic Times 2016"/&gt;
* The Sugu Company of Taiwan has produced edible plates and other edible tableware items, and in 1986 claimed to have invented the "world's first range of edible tableware" as a means to replace [[disposable tableware]].&lt;ref name="Enfo 1986"/&gt;
* The Delhi-based "Project Patradya" makes edible bowls in three sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enactuskmc.org/patradya|title=EnactusKMC - Changing Lives - Creating Impact - Delhi|website=EnactusKMC - Changing Lives - Creating Impact - Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project helps Afghan refugees in India.
* The Defence Food Research Laboratory (DFRL), India, has displayed edible cutleries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starofmysore.com/edible-cutleries-dfrl-display-aero-india-show/|title=Edible cutleries of DFRL on display at Aero India Show - Star of Mysore|date=17 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and has been promoting and transferring the technology related to edible cutlery &lt;ref&gt;https://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/pub/npc/2017/october/din-13october2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Edible tableware such as cups, bowls, plates and platters prepared using [[sugar paste]] have been in use since at least the [[Elizabethan era]] and edible tableware was considered as a sign of wealth.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 2007"/&gt; in 1562, a recipe for edible tableware and cutlery prepared as sugar confectioneries was published by [[Alexius Pedemontanus]] in a manual he authored.&lt;ref name="Richardson 2008"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=March 2012}}

'''The Estonian Patriotic Movement''' (''Eesti Rahvuslik Liikumine'', '''ERL''') was a political [[pressure group]] in [[Estonia]]. The group was set up in the middle of 2006 to promote the removal of the monument to the [[Bronze Soldier of Tallinn]] from the heart of the Estonian capital, [[Tallinn]]. In February 2012, it claimed a membership of 268.

==Politics==
{{As of|2007}}, the primary political positions of the ERL were opposition to building the planned [[Nord Stream]] pipeline through the [[Baltic Sea]], dislike for Estonia being a member state of the [[European Union]], support for a [[NATO]] military base being installed in Estonia and disdain for the [[Estonian Centre Party]]'s perceived improper acts.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ehala "The birth of the Russian-speaking minority in Estonia" ''Eurozine'' Sept 11, 2008 [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2008-09-11-ehala-en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement has also repeatedly expressed displeasure for the [[Russian Federation]]'s covert influence in Estonia's internal affairs.  On June 20, 2007, the movement issued a press release demanding declaring the Russian Ambassador to Estonia, Nikolai Uspenski, a ''[[persona non grata]]'' based on his repeated attempts to exert such influence. This was triggered by the ambassador's presence at an establishment meeting of Russki Mir in Tallinn.

In February 2012, it was announced that the movement would merge with the [[People's Union of Estonia]] to form the [[Estonian Conservative People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delfi.ee/news/paevauudised/eesti/rahvuslik-liikumine-paneb-rahvaliiduga-leivad-uhte-kappi.d?id=63940007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Forms of government}}

An '''ethnocracy''' is a type of political structure in which the [[State (polity)|state]] apparatus is appropriated by a dominant [[ethnic group]] (or groups) to further its interests, power and resources. Ethnocratic regimes typically display a combination of 'thin' democratic facade covering a more profound ethnic structure, in which ethnicity (or race, or religion) – and not citizenship – is the key to securing power and resources. An ethnocratic society facilitates the ethnicization of the state by the dominant group, through the expansion of control, often through conflict with minorities and neighboring states.

== Definition == 
In the 20th century, a few states passed, or attempted to pass, nationality laws, through efforts that share certain similarities. All took place in countries with at least one national minority that sought full equality in the state or in a territory that had become part of the state and in which it had lived for generations. Nationality laws were passed in societies that felt threatened by these minorities' aspirations of integration and demands for equality, resulting in regimes that turned xenophobia into major tropes. Nationality laws were passed in states that were grounded in one ethnic identity, defined in contrast to the identity of the other, leading to persecution of and codified discrimination against minorities.&lt;ref name="haaretz5"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blatman|first=Daniel|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.628683|title=The 'Nation-state' Bill: Jews Should Know Exactly Where It Leads|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''|date=27 November 2014|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that several spheres of regime control are vital for ethnocratic regimes, including the armed forces, police, land administration, immigration control and economic development. These power government instruments ensure the long-term domination of the leading ethnic groups, and the stratification of society into 'ethnoclasses', which has been exacerbated by the recent stage of [[capitalism]], with its typical neo-liberal policies. Ethnocracies often manage to contain ethnic conflict in the short term by effective control over minorities, and by effectively using the 'thin' procedural democratic façade. However, they tend to become unstable in the long term, suffering from repeated conflict and crisis, which are resolved by either substantive democratization, partition, or regime devolution into consociational arrangements. Alternatively, ethnocracies that do not resolve their internal conflict may deteriorate into periods of long-term internal strife and the institutionalization of structural discrimination or [[apartheid]].

In ethnocratic states the government is typically representative of a particular ethnic group holding a number of posts disproportionately large to the percentage of the total population. The dominant [[ethnic group]] (or groups) represents and use them to advance the position of their particular ethnic group(s) to the detriment of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yiftachel | first1 = O | year = 1997 | title = 'Israeli Society and Jewish-Palestinian Reconciliation: Ethnocracy and Its Territorial Contradictions' | url = | journal = Middle East Journal | volume = 51 | issue = 4| pages = 505–519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yiftachel, O.

(2006) Ethnocracy: Land, and the Politics of Identity Israel/Palestine (PennPress)&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ethnic groups are systematically discriminated against by the state and may face repression or violations of their human rights at the hands of state organs. Ethnocracy can also be a political regime which is instituted on the basis of qualified rights to citizenship, and with ethnic affiliation (defined in terms of race, descent, religion, or language) as the distinguishing principle.&lt;ref&gt;Kariye, Badal W. "The Political Sociology of Security, Politics, Economics and Diplomacy" AuthorHouse 2010; {{ISBN|9781452085470}}, p. 99, item 20 View on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the raison d'être of an ethnocratic government is to secure the most important instruments of state power in the hands of a specific ethnic collectivity. All other considerations concerning the distribution of power are ultimately subordinated to this basic intention.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Ethnocracies are characterized by their control system – the legal, institutional, and physical instruments of power deemed necessary to secure ethnic dominance. The degree of system discrimination will tend to vary greatly from case to case and from situation to situation. If the dominant group (whose interests the system is meant to serve and whose identity it is meant to represent) constitutes a small minority (typically 20% or less) of the population within the state territory, substantial degrees of institutionalized suppression will probably be necessary to sustain its control.

==Mono-ethnocracy vs. poly-ethnocracy==
In October 2012, Lise Morjé Howard&lt;ref name="HowardLM2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howard | first1 = L. M. | year = 2012 | title = The Ethnocracy Trap | url = | journal = Journal of Democracy | volume = 23 | issue = 4| pages = 155–169 | doi=10.1353/jod.2012.0068}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the terms ''mono-ethnocracy'' and ''poly-ethnocracy''.  Mono-ethnocracy is a type of regime where one ethnic group dominates, which conforms with the traditional understanding of ethnocracy.  Poly-ethnocracy is a type of regime where more than one ethnic group governs the state.  Both mono- and poly-ethnocracy are types of ethnocracy.  Ethnocracy is founded on the assumptions that ethnic groups are primordial, ethnicity is the basis of political identity, and citizens rarely share multiple ethnic identities.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Ethnocracies around the world==
===Belgium===
Lise Morjé Howard&lt;ref name="HowardLM2012"/&gt; has labeled Belgium as both a poly-ethnocracy and a democracy. Citizens in Belgium exercise political rights found in democracies, such as voting and free speech. However, Belgian politics is increasingly defined by ethnic divisions between the Flemish and Francophone. For example, all the major political parties are formed around either a Flemish or Francophone identity. Furthermore, bilingual education has disappeared from most Francophone schools.

===Israel===
Israel has been labeled an ethnocracy by scholars such as: Alexander Kedar,&lt;ref name="Taking space seriously"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosen-Zvi|first=Issachar|title=Taking space seriously: law, space, and society in contemporary Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GFaprMmLaOIC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=Alexander+Kedar+ethnocracy&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xGx1Tc-iIIi7hAf_rJVN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Alexander%20Kedar%20ethnocracy&amp;f=false|year=2004|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|page= |isbn=978-0754623519}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shlomo Sand]],&lt;ref name="haaretz2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Strenger|first=Carlo|url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/strenger-than-fiction/shlomo-sand-s-the-invention-of-the-jewish-people-is-a-success-for-israel-1.3247|title=Shlomo Sand's 'The Invention of the Jewish People' Is a Success for Israel|work= |location= |publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''|date=27 November 2009|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oren Yiftachel]],&lt;ref name="Ethnocracy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yiftachel|first=Oren|title=Ethnocracy: Land and Identity Politics in Israel/Palestine|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VD082HtsKRsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Ethnocracy:+Land+and+Identity+Politics+in+Israel/Palestine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqt4m8-9nJAhWGwBQKHYKVDvsQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ethnocracy%3A%20Land%20and%20Identity%20Politics%20in%20Israel%2FPalestine&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|page= |isbn=978-0812239270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asaad Ghanem,&lt;ref name="Israel's Palestinians"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peleg|first1=Ilan|last2=Waxman|first2=Dov|title=Israel's Palestinians: The Conflict Within|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oIi3BK_mT5YC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=It+can+be+defined+as+an+ethnocratic+state+Asaad+Ghanem+in+the+Future+Vision+Document&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB_YfQ-dnJAhULuxQKHaesAF4Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=It%20can%20be%20defined%20as%20an%20ethnocratic%20state%20Asaad%20Ghanem%20in%20the%20Future%20Vision%20Document&amp;f=false|year=2011|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|quote=It can be defined as an ethnocratic state &amp;#91;...&amp;#93;," writes Asaad Ghanem in the Future Vision Document|page=73|isbn=978-0521157025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Israel Studies Forum"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Israel Studies Forum: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume=22–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82kuAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=ethnocracy+%22ethnic+democracy%22&amp;dq=ethnocracy+%22ethnic+democracy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dG11Tc7DDM67hAeVv9RU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ|year=2004|publisher=[[Association for Israel Studies]]|page= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haim Yakobi,&lt;ref name="Urban Informality"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roy|first1=Ananya|first2=AlSayyad|last2=Nezar|title=Urban Informality: Transnational Perspectives from the Middle East, Latin America, and South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxAGdfEiIXEC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=ethnocracy+israel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Vm91Tb-kOI6AhQfb2tBD&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnocracy%20israel&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|page= |isbn=978-0739107416}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nur Masalha]]&lt;ref name="The Bible and Zionism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Masalha|first=Nur|title=The Bible and Zionism: Invented Traditions, Archaeology and Post-colonialism in Palestine-Israel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAUeWo8NDK4C&amp;pg=PA297&amp;dq=ethnocracy+israel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tG91Tby7C8GohAfh-61K&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnocracy%20israel&amp;f=false|volume=1|year=2003|publisher=[[Zed Books]]|page= |isbn=978-1842777619}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hannah Naveh.&lt;ref name="Israeli Family and Community"&gt;{{cite book |last=Naveh|first=Hannah|title=Israeli Family and Community: Women's Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KR63AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=ethnocracy+israel&amp;dq=ethnocracy+israel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=tG91Tby7C8GohAfh-61K&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK|year=2003|publisher=Vallentine Mitchell|page= |isbn=978-0853035053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, scholars such as Gershon Shafir, Yoav Peled and [[Sammy Smooha]] prefer the term [[ethnic democracy]] to describe Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Uri Ram, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0JctCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66 ''Nationalism: Social conflicts and the politics of knowledge,''] Taylor &amp; Francis, 2010 pp.63-67.&lt;/ref&gt; a term which is intended&lt;ref&gt;Michael Galchinsky, [https://books.google.it/books?id=IUUuFeeM1OwC&amp;pg=PA144 ''Jews and Human Rights: Dancing at Three Weddings,''] Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008 p.144&lt;/ref&gt; to represent a "[[middle ground]]" between an ethnocracy and a liberal democracy. Smooha in particular argues that ethnocracy, allowing a privileged status to a dominant ethnic majority while ensuring that all individuals have equal rights, is defensible. His opponents reply that in so far as Israel contravenes equality in practice, the term 'democratic' in his equation is flawed.&lt;ref name="Attwell" &gt;Katie Attwell, [https://books.google.it/books?id=tLKYBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 ''Israeli National Identity and Dissidence: The Contradictions of Zionism and Resistance,''] Palgrave Macmillan, 2015 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia and Estonia===
There is a spectrum of opinion among authors as to the classification of [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], spanning from [[Liberal democracy|Liberal or Civic Democracy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Pickles |first2=Adrian |last2=Smith |title=Theorising transition: the political economy of post-Communist transformations |location= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1998 |page=284 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jubulis |first=M. |chapter=Nationalism and Democratic Transition |title=The Politics of Citizenship and Language in Post-Soviet Latvia |location=Lanham, New York and Oxford |publisher=University Press of America |year=2001 |pages=201–208 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Ethnic democracy]]&lt;ref name=CommonMarket&gt;[http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 Discrimination against the Russophone Minority in Estonia and Latvia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504025222/http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |date=2008-05-04 }} — synopsis of article published in the ''Journal of Common Market Studies'' (November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; to Ethnocracy.

British researcher [[Neil Melvin]] concludes that Estonia is moving towards a genuinely pluralist democratic society through its liberalization of citizenship and actively drawing of leaders of the Russian settler communities into the political process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Melvin|first=N.J.|chapter=Post imperial Ethnocracy and the Russophone Minorities of Estonia and Latvia |title=The Policies of National Minority Participation Post-Communist Europe.

Israeli researchers [[Oren Yiftachel]] and [[As'ad Ghanem]] consider [[Estonia]] as an ethnocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yiftachel|first=Oren |author2=As’ad Ghanem|date=August 2004|title=Understanding 'ethnocratic' regimes: the politics of seizing contested territories |journal=[[Political Geography (journal)|Political Geography]]|volume=23|issue=6|doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2004.04.003 |pages=647–676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/events/ethnocratic-states-and-spaces|title=Ethnocratic States and Spaces|last=Yiftachel|first=Oren|date=23 January 2004|publisher=[[United States Institute of Peace]]|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli sociologist Sammy Smooha, of the [[University of Haifa]], disagrees with Yiftachel, contending that the ethnocratic model developed by Yiftachel does not fit the case of Latvia and Estonia; it is not a settler society as its core ethnic group is indigenous, nor did it expand territorially or have a [[diaspora]] intervening in its internal affairs as in the case of Israel for which Yiftachel originally developed his model.&lt;ref&gt;Smooha, S.

===Northern Ireland===
Northern Ireland has been described as an ethnocracy by numerous scholars. Wendy Pullan describes [[gerrymandering]] of electoral districts to ensure Unionist domination, and informal policies that led to the police force being overwhelmingly Protestant, as features of the Unionist ethnocracy. Other elements included discriminatory housing and policies designed to encourage Catholic emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Locating Urban Conflicts: Ethnicity, Nationalism and the Everyday|first=Wendy|last=Pullan|pages=208–209|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Shuttleworth, Myles Gould and Paul Barr agree that the systematic bias against Catholics and Irish nationalists fit the criteria for describing Northern Ireland as an ethnocracy from the time of the partition of Ireland until at least 1972, but argue that after the suspension of the Stormont Parliament, and even more so after the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998, ethnocracy was weakened, and that Northern Ireland cannot be plausibly described as an ethnocracy today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social-Spatial Segregation: Concepts, Processes and Outcomes |pages=201–202 |publisher=Policy Press |year=2015 |first=Ian |last=Shuttleworth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Ethnocracy indicates a specific principle of power-distribution in a society. In his book ''[[Power-Sharing in South Africa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lijphart |first=Arend |title=Power-sharing in South Africa|publisher=Berkeley: Institute of International Studies, University of California|year=1985|isbn=0-87725-524-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arend Lijphart]] classifies contemporary constitutional proposals for a solution to the conflict in [[South Africa]] into four categories:

* [[majoritarian]] (one man, one vote)
* non-democratic (varieties of white domination)
* partitionist (creating new political entities)
* [[consociational]] (power-sharing by proportional representation and elite accommodation) (1985:5)

Lijphart argues strongly in favour of the consociational model and his categories illustrates that, on the constitutional level, state power can be distributed along two dimensions: legal-institutional and territorial.
Along the legal-institutional dimension we can distinguish between singularism (power centralised according to membership in a specific group), pluralism (power-distribution among defined groups according to relative numerical strength), and universalism (power-distribution without any group-specific qualifications). The three main alternatives on the territorial dimension are the unitary state, "intermediate restructuring" (within one formal sovereignty), and partition (creating separate political entities). Ethnocracy indicates a specific principle of power-distribution in a society.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Turkey===
Turkey has been described as an ethnocracy by Bilge Azgin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man-scw:181953&amp;datastreamId=FULL-TEXT.PDF The Uneasy Democratization of Turkey's Laic-Ethnocracy]&lt;/ref&gt; Azgin points to government policies whose goals are the "exclusion, marginalization, or assimilation" of minority groups that are non-Turkish  as the defining elements of Turkish ethnocracy. As'ad Ghanem {{Who|date=December 2015}} also considers Turkey as an ethnocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/political_science/documents/NeitherEthnocracynorBinationalism.pdf|title=Neither Ethnocracy nor Bi-Nationalism: In Search of the Middle Ground|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Fong {{Who|date=December 2015}} describes Turkey's policy of referring to its Kurdish minority as "mountain Turks" and to its refusal to acknowledge any separate Kurdish identity as elements of the Turkish ethnocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Revolution as Development: The Karen Self-Determination Struggle Against Ethnocracy (1949- 2004)|page=81|first=Jack|last=Fong|year=2008|publisher=Universal-Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Family First Party''' was a conservative political party in [[Australia]], in existence from 2002 to 2017. It was founded in [[South Australia]] and enjoyed its greatest popularity in that state.

Family First had three candidates elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] during its existence—[[Steve Fielding]] (2005–2011), [[Bob Day]] (2014–2016), and [[Lucy Gichuhi]] (2017; elected on a [[countback]] following Day being declared ineligible). At state level, the party won a seat in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] across four consecutive state elections ([[South Australian state election, 2002|2002]], [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006]], [[South Australian state election, 2010|2010]], and [[South Australian state election, 2014|2014]]). It also briefly had representatives in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] and [[Western Australian Legislative Council]], as a result of defections from other parties.

The party was generally considered to be part of the [[Christian right]]. Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the [[Pentecostal church]] in South Australia, and nationally from smaller Christian denominations. Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-[[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] via [[Robert Brokenshire]] and [[Bob Day]]. Originally advocating a moral and family values agenda, Day, who would become Family First's major donor, later reoriented Family First to begin to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and smaller government, which brought Family First closer to [[Cory Bernardi]]'s [[Australian Conservatives]].  Family First and their two state incumbents merged in to Bernardi's Conservatives in April 2017.&lt;ref name=antonyabc&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=The Urge to merge - Family First and the Australian Conservatives |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2017/04/the-urge-to-merge-family-first-and-the-australian-conservatives.html |accessdate=4 May 2017 |work=ABC |date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party was founded in [[South Australia]] in time to contest the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 state election]], when former [[Assemblies of God]] pastor [[Andrew Evans (pastor)|Andrew Evans]] became its first elected member, winning a seat in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]]. A second party member, pharmaceutical executive [[Dennis Hood]], was elected to the Legislative Council at the [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006 state election]]. [[Robert Brokenshire]] replaced Andrew Evans following the latter's retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24070079-2682,00.html |title= New MLC Robert Brokenshire puts major parties on notice |work= [[AdelaideNow]] |date= 24 July 2008 |accessdate= 24 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], Family First contested seats all over Australia, generally exchanging [[Ranked voting systems|preferences]] with [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidates, although in some seats it exchanged preferences with the [[Australian Labor Party]]. At that election the party was successful in having [[Steve Fielding]] elected as a Senator for [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. Along with independent [[Nick Xenophon]] and the five [[Australian Greens]], Fielding shared the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Senate from July 2008 to July 2011. He was defeated in the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]].

In June 2008, sitting MP and former [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] member, [[Dan Sullivan (Australian politician)|Dan Sullivan]], joined the [[Western Australia]] State Branch of Family First as an executive member. When three former [[One Nation (Australia)|One Nation]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s attended the public launch of the Branch, it fuelled media speculation that they might try to influence the West Australian branch.&lt;ref name="ABC_Fisher2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fischer throws weight behind Family First in WA |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/22/2281987.htm |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2008-06-22 |accessdate=2008-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Y7_Sullivan"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sullivan to lead Family First |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/080620/21/17db8.html |publisher=[[Yahoo!7]] |date=2008-06-20 |accessdate=2008-06-25 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009/10 financial year, party chairman [[Bob Day]] made two loans totalling $405,000 to Family First. After gaining 4 per cent of the vote in several [[Australian House of Representatives|lower house]] seats in the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], the party also received around $400,000 in Commonwealth election funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/family-first-gets-405000-lifeline-from-its-chairman-20110212-1are4.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first1=Ruth | last1=Williams | first2=Mark | last2=Hawthorne | title=Family First gets $405,000 lifeline from its chairman | date=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family First returned to the Australian Senate at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], when [[Bob Day]] was elected as a Senator for South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.aec.gov.au/17496/Website/SenateSenatorsElected-17496-NAT.htm|title=Senators Elected|publisher=Australian ElectoralCommission}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected at the 2016 [[double dissolution]] election. Only a few months later, his family-owned building company, Home Australia Group, ran into financial difficulties and was wound up. Day announced immediately that he would resign from the senate as a consequence, however he did not resign instantly, allowing time for the party to develop a process for selecting a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indaily.com.au/news/politics/2016/10/25/simple-family-first-transition-wildly-optimistic/ |title=Simple Family First transition "wildly optimistic" |first=Tom |last=Richardson |newspaper=[[InDaily]] |date=25 October 2016 |access-date=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned on 1 November 2016 creating a vacancy in the senate. In April 2017 the high court ruled that he was invalidly elected in July 2016 and had been ineligible to sit in the senate since February 2016.&lt;ref name="DayIneligibleRuling"/&gt;

The vacancy created by Day's resignation was filled by another Family First senate candidate, [[Lucy Gichuhi]]. Gichuhi was declared by the court of disputed returns on 13 April 2017 to be elected instead of Day, after a special recount of South Australian senate votes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-13/family-first-lucy-gichuhi-replaces-bob-day-in-senate/8442564 |title=Family First's Lucy Gichuhi set to replace Bob Day in South Australian Senate seat |date=13 April 2017 |work=ABC News |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |first1=Chris |last1=Uhlmann |first2=Matthew |last2=Doran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Day resigned"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indaily.com.au/news/politics/2016/11/01/finally-bob-calls-it-a-day/ |title=Finally, Bob calls it a Day |date=1 November 2016 |first=Tom |last=Richardson |newspaper=[[InDaily]] |access-date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merger with the Australian Conservatives===
On 26 April 2017, a merger between the [[Australian Conservatives]] and the Family First Party was announced, with Family First to be absorbed into the Conservatives.&lt;ref name="merger-aus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Owen|first1=Michael|title=Bernardi and Family First join forces for conservative vote|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/bernardi-and-family-first-join-forces-for-conservative-vote/news-story/c2604388c3b1c7b1b320d7e9678f8b3d|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=The Australian|date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newly appointed Family First senator [[Lucy Gichuhi]] did not join the Conservatives, and became an independent senator when the Family First Party was disbanded.&lt;ref name="gichuhi-ind"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belot|first1=Henry|title=Bernardi unwilling to wait for Gichuhi to 'get her head around' party merger|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-26/cory-bernardi-unwilling-to-wait-for-gicuchi-for-amalgamation/8472754|accessdate=26 April 2017|work=ABC News|date=26 April 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party formally relinquished its registration with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] on 30 August 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/files/2017-6292.pdf |title=Family First Party Voluntary Deregistration |quote=Notice under s 135(1) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 The Family First Party was registered on 5 March 2004 and deregistered on 30 August 2017. Reason: s 135(1) – voluntary deregistration |date=30 August 2017 |accessdate=1 September 2017 |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psephologist [[Antony Green]] suggested the merger could in part be attributed to the abolition of [[group voting ticket]]s, which makes it more difficult for like-minded parties to swap [[Instant-runoff voting|preferences]] without a certain amount of "leakage" to other parties.&lt;ref name=antonyabc/&gt;

== Religious affiliation ==
Although officially eschewing religious labels, many of its candidates and members were from [[Christian fundamentalism|conservative Christian]] backgrounds. Family First co-founder Pastor [[Andrew Evans (pastor)|Andrew Evans]] was the General Superintendent of the [[Assemblies of God in Australia]] for twenty years.&lt;ref name="ABC20040929_TheReligionReport"&gt;{{ cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 South Australian election]] and the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], a number of Family First candidates were church members. In [[New South Wales]], 11 of their 23 candidates for the 2004 federal election were from an Assemblies of God church, the Hawkesbury Church in [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]].&lt;ref name="SMH20040924_BehindFamilyFirst"&gt;{{cite news

South Australian Family First Member of the Legislative Council [[Dennis Hood]], the party's state parliamentary leader, is a member of the [[Rostrevor Baptist Church]]. When ''[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]]'' columnist [[Peter Goers]] stated that Hood was an anti-evolution [[Creationist]],&lt;ref name="SundayMail20060813_Hood"&gt;{{ cite news

Family First's preferencing agreement with the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] in the 2004 federal election led [[Barnaby Joyce]], the [[National Party of Australia|National]] senate candidate for Queensland, to publicly slam the party the day before the election, calling them "the lunatic Right", and stating that "these are not the sort of people you do preference deals with".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper =  [[The Australian]]  | title =  Nationals split over Family First deal – Election 2004| first = Greg | last = Roberts |department=Local | page = 9  | date = 8 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce's comments came in response to a pamphlet published by one of the party's Victorian Senate candidates, [[Danny Nalliah]] who in his capacity as a church pastor had criticised other religions and homosexuality.

In September 2004, party leader [[Andrea Mason]] said that Family First is not a Christian party&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Family First Federal Secretary Dr Matt Burnet issued a press release stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The party is not a church party or an Assembly of God party, nor is it funded by AOG churches. It does see itself as socially conservative, with Family Values based on Christian ethics. Like any mainstream party we do not have on record the religious affiliations of any of our members. The Board of Reference in South Australia includes business-people, members of the medical profession, as well as ministers and people from Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran, Uniting and other church groups. The rapid national growth of the party leading into this election and the late decision to contest in all seats possible, has meant that in some states there are candidates, with strong family values, who have been introduced to the party through the personal relationships they have from their involvement in community/church networks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 60-minute documentary was made for the ABC-TV Compass program in 2005 and called "Family First – A Federal Crusade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/compass/s1358912.htm|title=Compass: Family First: A Federal Crusade - ABC TV|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Dr [[Bruce Redman]] from The University of Queensland.

By August 2010, the party maintained its non-denominational stance and affirmed its affinity towards Christianity in stating "Family First in 2010 is independent of any church or denomination...like so many other Australian institutions, at Family First our Christian
heritage is something we are both proud of and grateful for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa-familyfirst.org.au/about.htm |title=Family First – South Australia |publisher=Family First |date= |accessdate=2010-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820120812/http://www.sa-familyfirst.org.au/about.htm |archivedate=20 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections and results==
===Federal elections===

====2004 federal election ====
The party agreed to share House of Representatives preferences with the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]&amp;ndash;[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.familyfirst.org.au/mr/fullpref240904.pdf|publisher = Family First Party|title = House of Representatives Preferencing  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080414012231/http://www.familyfirst.org.au/mr/fullpref240904.pdf |date = 24 September 2004|archivedate = 14 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (with some exceptions discussed below).

Family First picked up 1.76 percent of the vote nationally. [[Steve Fielding]], the lead candidate in Victoria, was successful in picking up the last Senate seat. Although he received a primary vote of only 1.88 percent (56,376 votes), he achieved the 14.3 percent quota required by a run of preferences including those from the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The typically apolitical [[psephologist]] [[Malcolm Mackerras]] stated "The outlandish result occurred in Victoria in 2004 where the Family First party was able to gather tickets from just about everywhere... this is a fluke. And I’ve always referred to Senator Steve Fielding as the Fluke Senator".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reportageonline.com/2010/08/family-first-faces-tough-election/ |title=Family First faces tough election: Reportage 19&amp;nbsp;August 2010 |publisher=Reportageonline.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party also came close to picking up other Senate seats in [[Tasmania]] (largely due to preferences from surplus Liberal votes) and in [[South Australia]] where the then party leader [[Andrea Mason]] narrowly missed out (polling 3.98 percent and receiving Liberal preferences).

====2007 federal election====
Family First contested the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], in particular seeking to increase its Senate representation. Nationwide, the party received 1.62 percent of the primary vote in the Senate, and 1.99 percent in the House of Representatives, both down slightly on the 2004 result. In Victoria however, both the [[House of Representatives results for the Australian federal election, 2007#Victoria|lower]] and [[Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2007#Victoria|upper house vote]] increased by 0.64 percent, to 2.52 and 3.02 percent respectively. No Family First candidates were elected. Sitting Senator Steve Fielding's term did not expire until 2011.

Before the 2007 federal election, [[Fred Nile]] criticized Family First for giving preferences (in some states) to the [[Liberty and Democracy Party]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] political party that as one of its policies wants to legalize recreational drug use, stating "They gave their preferences to the enemy, the anti-Christian party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Christian party's unholy alliance|publisher=[[Herald Sun]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22709097-5013904,00.html|author=Steve Lewis|date=2007-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was suggested as a reason for their poor election result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=

In 2008, some newspapers claimed that Fielding wanted to "relaunch himself as a mainstream political player, beyond Family First's ultra-conservative evangelical Christian support base." The reports indicated that Fielding had tried to recruit [[Tim Costello]] and others around the beginning of 2008 with a view to forming a new party, but had failed to convince them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper =  [[Herald Sun]]  | title =  Senator wanted to quit| first1 = Ben | last1 = Packham |first2 = Peter| last2 = Jean |department=News | page = 4  | date = 30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revelations came after Fielding changed his position on abortion, after being rebuffed by his party for taking a softer approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper =  [[Herald Sun]]  | title =  Fielding abortion heat Retreat on women's rights comments| first = Ben | last = Packham |department=News | page = 11  | date = 27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fielding denied the claims.

====2010 federal election====
At the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], Family First contested the Senate in all states, but were not successful, with the national vote remaining at around two percent.

====2016 federal election====
{{see also|Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2016#South Australia}}
As Family First's sole incumbent, [[Bob Day]] was unexpectedly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/family-first-senator-bob-day-reelected-in-south-australia-labor-misses-out-20160802-gqj12u.html|title=Family First Senator Bob Day re-elected in South Australia, Labor misses out|first=Michael|last=Koziol|date=2 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; successful at the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]], despite having unsuccessfully mounted a [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] challenge against [[Australian Senate#2016 Senate voting changes|newly implemented Senate voting reforms]] which included the removal of [[group voting ticket]]s, a feature which was crucial to the election of Day at the previous election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-13/senate-voting-reform-challenge-thrown-out-by-high-court/7410986|title=Senate voting reform challenge thrown out by High Court|date=13 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the South Australian Senate Family First vote was reduced to just 2.9 percent (down 0.9 percent),&lt;ref&gt;[http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-20499-SA.htm SA Senate 2016 election: AEC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812141304/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-20499-SA.htm |date=12 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the election was a [[double dissolution]], the quota to be elected was halved. Day got to the 7.7 percent quota largely from Liberal preferences when the Liberal's 5th candidate [[Sean Edwards (politician)|Sean Edwards]] was eliminated from the count, largely due to the fact the Liberal [[how-to-vote card]] recommended Liberal voters to preference Family First.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2016/guide/ssa/htv/|title=Senate How to Votes: South Australia - Australia Votes - Federal Election 2016 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electing only six Senators per state at a non-double dissolution election, the 12th and last spot in South Australia at this election came down to a race between Day and Labor's 4th candidate [[Anne McEwen (politician)|Anne McEwen]]. McEwen solidly led Day for the overwhelming majority of the count, until count 445 of a total 457. However upon Edwards and then [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation|One Nation]] candidate Steven Burgess being eliminated at count 445 and 455 respectively, leaving only McEwen and Day remaining, Day had collected enough preferences to overtake and narrowly defeat McEwen − by just a couple of thousand preference votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2016/08/south-australia-senate-2016-distribution-of-preferences.html|title=South Australia Senate 2016 - Distribution of Preferences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vtr.aec.gov.au/External/SenateStateDop-20499-SA.pdf SA Senate 2016 election preference distribution: AEC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805051205/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/External/SenateStateDop-20499-SA.pdf |date=5 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger/2016/08/01/late-count-herbert-finalised-senate-results-imminent/|title=Late count: Herbert finalised, Senate results imminent - The Poll Bludger|date=1 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationwide Family First Senate vote was 1.4 percent (up 0.3 percent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-20499-NAT.htm Senate 2016 election: AEC] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160812105302/http://vtr.aec.gov.au/SenateStateFirstPrefsByGroup-20499-NAT.htm |date=12 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elected to the [[Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2016#South Australia|12th and final South Australian Senate spot]], he was allocated a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/coalition-and-labor-team-up-to-clear-out-crossbench-senators-in-2019-20160812-gqr29k.html|title=Coalition and Labor team up to clear out crossbench senators in 2019|first=Fergus|last=Hunter|date=12 August 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the failure of his home construction business, Day resigned from the Senate on 1 November 2016 and a replacement was expected to be selected in the following two to three weeks{{update after|2016|11}}.&lt;ref name="Day resigned"/&gt; In April 2017, the High Court found that he was invalidly elected to the senate at the 2016 election because the leasing arrangements for his electoral office had breached section 44 of the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] making him ineligible for the Senate, leading to a special recount of South Australian senate ballots to find a replacement.&lt;ref name="DayIneligibleRuling"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-05/family-first-bob-day-election-ruled-invalid-by-high-court/8417204 |title=Family First ex-senator Bob Day's election ruled invalid by High Court |date=5 April 2017 |work=ABC News |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal by-elections since 2004====
Following the resignation of [[Mark Latham]] and their acquisition of a Senate seat in 2004, Family First contested [[Werriwa by-election, 2005|the 2005 Werriwa by-election]] and in the absence of a Liberal candidate received 2,890 first preference votes. They had not contested Werriwa in 2004.

As a result of their relatively poor form in the 2007 election, Family First did not contest [[Gippsland by-election, 2008|the 2008 Gippsland by-election]], but in [[Mayo by-election, 2008|a later by-election for the seat of Mayo]] they won 11.40 percent of the vote but only ran fourth in the absence of a Labor candidate, a total that was only four percent above their vote in the 2007 general election.

Family First did not stand a candidate in any of the [[Lyne by-election, 2008|2008 Lyne]], [[Bradfield by-election, 2009|2009 Bradfield]] or [[Higgins by-election, 2009|2009 Higgins]] by-elections.

===State elections===

====2002 South Australian election====
The first election Family First contested was the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 South Australian Election]]. [[Andrew Evans (pastor)|Dr Andrew Evans]] received a primary vote of 4.02 percent which, along with preferences from other parties, was sufficient to obtain the 8.3 percent quota and get elected to one of the 11 seats available in the [[South Australian Legislative Council]].

====State elections from 2004 until 2017====
In the [[Western Australian state election, 2005|2005 Western Australian election]], Family First polled 21,701 votes in the Legislative Council where it contested 34 candidates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waec.wa.gov.au/elections/documents/state/2005/LA%20Elected%20Members%20of%20Parliament%20-%20P21.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614162310/http://www.waec.wa.gov.au/elections/documents/state/2005/LA%20Elected%20Members%20of%20Parliament%20-%20P21.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  compared to 57 candidates in major parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=WA Electoral Commission |title=State General Election Results on www.waec.wa.gov.au |url=http://www.waec.wa.gov.au/elections/documents/state/2005/LA%20Candidates%202005%20-%20P11.pdf |access-date=25 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019172629/http://www.waec.wa.gov.au/elections/documents/state/2005/LA%20Candidates%202005%20-%20P11.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006 South Australian election]], Family First's vote increased to 4.98 percent in the Legislative Council, and a second Member of the Legislative Council was elected – former pharmaceutical executive [[Dennis Hood]]. In several rural and outer metropolitan seats, Family First's vote approached 10 percent – and in the seat of [[Electoral district of Kavel|Kavel]], Tom Playford, a descendent of former [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[Tom Playford]], achieved a vote of 15.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/kave.htm |title=2006 South Australian Election.

In the 2006 Queensland state election, Family First received a primary vote of 7 percent in contested seats (many seats were not contested), with a high of 14.5 percent and several other seats posting results of 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/minor-parties-hail-poll-results/2006/09/10/1157826802417.html |title=Minor parties hail poll results – National |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2006-09-10 |accessdate=2010-06-16 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qld-familyfirst.org.au/QLD.htm |title=:: Family First – Queensland:: |publisher=Qld-familyfirst.org.au |date= |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507131445/http://www.qld-familyfirst.org.au/QLD.htm |archivedate=7 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queensland does not have an Upper House, and these results were insufficient for any candidates to be elected.

In the 2006 Victorian state election, Family First's vote increased from 1.9 percent to 4.3 percent of first preferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper =  [[The Age]]  | title =  Family First buoyed| first =  Mathew| last = Murphy | page = 10 | date = 27 November 2006 | accessdate = 16 Aug 2010 | url =http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=AGE061127LT7D66FJ28N }}&lt;/ref&gt; however no candidates were elected.

In the [[Queensland state election, 2012|2012 Queensland state election]] the party unsuccessfully contested 38 seats.

In the [[Western Australian state election, 2017|2017 Western Australian election]], Family First fielded 2 candidates in each of the six [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] regions, and three candidates for [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elections.wa.gov.au/candidates-and-parties/registered-political-parties-wa |title=Registered Political Parties in WA |publisher=[[Western Australian Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voting for the legislative council uses [[group voting ticket]]s. Family First has participated with four other parties in a set of preference deals orchestrated by [[Glenn Druery]]. The other parties are [[Fluoride Free WA]], [[Liberal Democratic Party (Australia)|Liberal Democrats]], [[Flux the System]] and the [[Daylight Saving Party]]. The deals are arranged so that the ticket votes for these five parties roll up to a different party in each region. The system collects votes so that Family First's best chance is in [[Electoral region of North Metropolitan|North Metropolitan region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-15/micro-parties-stitch-up-preference-deal-targeting-five-seats/8274278 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |title=WA election: Micro party preference deal could take five seats in Upper House |first=Laura |last=Gartry |date=15 February 2017 |accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defections from other parties==
The party has benefited from a series of high-profile defections.
*Former South Australian state Liberal minister [[Robert Brokenshire]] contested the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] for the party, and subsequently won preselection to replace retiring founder Evans in the state Legislative Council. At the 2010 South Australian Election, Robert Brokenshire was re-elected as a Family First candidate for a Legislative Council seat.

Fels remained a member of the Legislative Council until his term expired in May 2009.
*Also in June 2008, [[Bob Randall (politician)|Bob Randall]], a former South Australian Liberal MP and party president joined the party, complaining that the Liberal Party had drifted too far to the "left", and that "Family First is the only truly conservative political force now left in Australia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.theage.com.au/national/former-liberal-leader-joins-family-first-20080623-2va3.html |title=Former Liberal leader joins Family First |publisher=News.theage.com.au |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2010-06-16 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Family First was incorporated as a [[company limited by guarantee]] and managed by an Executive Committee comprising the Board of Directors.

'''Freedom to Marry''' was the national [[bipartisan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winning Bipartisan Support|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/winning-bipartisan-support|website=Freedom to Marry|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization dedicated to winning marriage for same-sex couples in the [[United States]].  Freedom to Marry was founded in New York City in 2003 by [[Evan Wolfson]]. Wolfson served as president of the organization through the June 2015 victory at the Supreme Court, until the organization's official closing in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/freedom-to-marry-is-going-out-of-business-and-everybodys-thrilled/2015/07/30/5ca89b5c-322b-11e5-8f36-18d1d501920d_story.html |title=Freedom to Marry is going out of business. And everybody’s thrilled. |author=Karen Heller |date=July 30, 2015 |work= |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom to Marry drove the national strategy - what Freedom to Marry called the [http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/Roadmap-to-Victory “Roadmap to Victory”] - that led to the nationwide victory. The strategy aimed at a Supreme Court win bringing the country to national resolution, once advocates had succeeded in creating the climate for the court by working on three tracks: winning marriage in a critical mass of states, growing national majority support for marriage, and ending marriage discrimination by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/roadmap-to-victory |title=Roadmap to Victory |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Freedom to Marry |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1983, at a time when same-sex couples had no country- or state-level recognition anywhere in the world, Evan Wolfson [http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/how-it-happened#section-2 wrote his Harvard Law School thesis] on the constitutional right to marriage for same-sex couples. He believed that by claiming the vocabulary of marriage, same-sex couples could transform the country's understanding of who gay people were and, as a result, why exclusion and discrimination are wrong. The [http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/Evan-Wolfsons-1983-thesis-on-the-freedom-to-marry thesis] outlined the arguments that ultimately became a national conversation and a legal and political set of battles that led to a transformation of public understanding and a triumph in the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How it Happened|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/how-it-happened#section-2|accessdate=February 5, 2016|publisher=Freedom to Marry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfson went on to serve full-time as the Marriage Director of Lambda Legal throughout the 1990s. He worked as co-counsel [http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/how-it-happened#section-3 in Hawaii’s landmark Baehr case], which launched the ongoing international freedom to marry movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How it Happened|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/how-it-happened#section-3|website=FreedomToMarry.org|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=February 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawaii case foreshadowed the pattern ahead: a legal breakthrough followed by political defeat, because of insufficient progress in changing hearts and minds. When, in 2000, Wolfson was approached by leaders of the Evelyn &amp; Walter Haas Jr. Fund, he successfully proposed that the foundation make a $2.5 million challenge grant investment in 2001 – then the largest foundation award in the history of the LGBT movement from a highly respected, non-LGBT foundation – to help Wolfson build a new campaign to win marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Marriage Equality Hall of Fame|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/home/2014/10/7/the-marriage-equality-hall-of-fame-8-funders-who-helped-make.html|accessdate=February 6, 2016|publisher=Inside Philanthropy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was officially launched in 2003, the birth of Freedom to Marry.

Wolfson knew from studying the history of civil rights movements that marriage for same-sex couples would become the law of the land only when one of the country's two national actors, Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court, brought national resolution to the cause. But a smart, strategic campaign was integral to creating the climate necessary to get to that point and to avoid seeing gains snatched away.

As in Hawaii (and even the earliest rounds of the marriage battle in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slevin|first1=Colleen|title=Colorado's gay marriage fight echoes drama in 1975|url=https://news.yahoo.com/colorados-gay-marriage-fight-echoes-drama-1975-070808609.html|accessdate=2016-02-16|publisher=Associated Press / Yahoo! News|date=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), litigation was central – but it wasn't enough. Wolfson called for the creation of a campaign that reflected what he called the "4 multi's": it would be multi-year (not expected to win overnight), multi-state (not watching as victories were picked off one by one), multi-partner (no one organization could do it all), and multi-methodology (it would combine litigation, lobbying, public education, organization, direct action, fund-raising, and even, eventually, electoral). Wolfson knew that marriage advocates didn't have to win every state, but they had to win enough states – and not every American had to be persuaded to support the freedom to marry, but enough Americans needed to be supportive before elected officials and judges, including the justices of the Supreme Court, would do the right thing.

Over two decades, the marriage movement built from only 27% support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Justin|title=Record-High 60% of Americans Support Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/183272/record-high-americans-support-sex-marriage.aspx|website=Gallup.com|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; among the American people in 1993 to 63% in 2015;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agiesta|first1=Jennifer|title=Poll: Majorities Back Supreme Court Rulings on Marriage, Obamacare|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/30/politics/supreme-court-gay-marriage-obamacare-poll/|accessdate=March 28, 2016|agency=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|date=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 0 states issuing marriage licenses in 2002 to 37 states and the District of Columbia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Changing Landscape of Same-Sex Marriage|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/same-sex-marriage/|website=Washington Post|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015, when the victories created the powerful momentum and energy that enabled the Supreme Court Justices to finish the job and strike down marriage discrimination once and for all.

==Areas of work==

===Messaging===
Beginning in 2010, Freedom to Marry created and coordinated a research collaborative, dubbed the Marriage Research Consortium, drawing together state and national partners such as the Movement Advancement Project, Basic Rights Oregon, and Third Way to "crack the code" on how to reach the next segment of the American public who were not yet part of the majority the campaign had achieved. Through cutting-edge research, focus groups, collaboration with the partners, and compilation of the experience gained in multiple campaigns (and losses), Freedom to Marry [http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/how-it-happened#section-10 pioneered a new messaging playbook] for the marriage movement called "[http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/Why-Marriage-Matters Why Marriage Matters]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dwyer|first1=Devin|title=Valentine's Day: Gay Rights Advocates Renew Push for Same-Sex Marriage|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gay-rights-advocates-renew-push-sex-marriage-valentines/story?id=12911051|accessdate=March 14, 2016|publisher=ABC News|date=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The playbook shifted from a previous focus on the rights and benefits that come with marriage towards values-based frames of love, commitment, freedom, family, and the Golden Rule. These were the messages that caused "middle" voters – those who Wolfson called the "reachable but not yet reached"—to move towards support, and helped contribute to the historic first victories for marriage at the ballot in 2012, to winning a majority of Americans in support of marriage, and to the movement's ultimate victory in 2015.

===Advertising and Media===
Through an aggressive and sophisticated media strategy, Freedom to Marry's "Press Room"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earned Media: State Support and The Press Room|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/State-Support-and-the-Press-Room|website=Freedom to Marry|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; drove the national narrative around marriage and combated marriage opponents' fear-based messaging. Freedom to Marry [https://www.youtube.com/user/FreedomToMarry funded, directed, and created ads] showcasing unexpected surrogates and stories of Americans' journeys to supporting marriage. Compelling messengers included veterans, Republicans, and family members of same-sex couples, and helped make the case in the court of public opinion that all of America is ready for the freedom to marry.

===Digital Action Center===
Freedom to Marry launched its Digital Action Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Action Center - Building State Campaigns|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/Digital-Action-Center|website=Freedom to Marry|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to leverage the national organization's successful online work and apply it across more than two dozen state digital campaigns. Freedom to Marry's award-winning digital team developed cutting edge online tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Digital to Build the Marriage Movement|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/Using-Digital-to-Build-the-Marriage-Movement|website=Freedom to Marry|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and innovative content strategies to engage marriage supporters in effective action, advance the organization's message online, raise funds, and tell the stories of people directly affected by marriage discrimination. In effect, Freedom to Marry was the digital "back end" of virtually all the key state campaigns in the last several years of the push. Freedom to Marry won numerous honors for its pioneering use of video and social work for advocacy such as the Silver 2015 Pollie Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom to Marry -- Our Work -- Blue State Digital|url=https://www.bluestatedigital.com/our-work/entry/freedom-to-marry|website=Blue State Digital|publisher=Blue State Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State campaigns===
Freedom to Marry's work in the states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building State Coalitions|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/Building-State-Coalitions|website=Freedom to Marry|publisher=Freedom to Marry|accessdate=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost always consisted of quickly and efficiently establishing state campaign coalitions, promoting teamwork, providing and enhancing expertise and a playbook of effective tactics, and generating needed funding. Freedom to Marry played a role in nearly every legislative and ballot win, and worked closely with its partners to create the climate for victory in states with pending litigation, enlisting expertise, resources, and infrastructure to support local advocates.

"Why Marriage Matters" was Freedom to Marry's national public education campaign.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gay-rights-advocates-renew-push-sex-marriage-valentines/story?id=12911051 |title=Gay Love, Equality Examined in Nationwide Valentine's Day Campaign |author= |date=February 14, 2011 |work= |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was launched on February 14, 2011&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt; The Why Marriage Matters project includes videos and stories from real people and real facts about why marriage matters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whymarriagematters.org/stories |title=Stories |author= |date=1 |work= |publisher=whymarriagematters.org |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a critical part of long-term efforts in the states.

===President Obama and Democrats "Say, 'I Do'"===
In March 2011, Freedom to Marry launched an open letter calling on Barack Obama to support marriage for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/page/s/i_do |title=Say, "I Do" Mr. President |author= |date= |work=|publisher=Freedom to Marry |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 122,000 people signed their names to the letter,&lt;ref name="christianpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/natalie-portman-fiance-benjamin-millepied-push-for-gay-marriage-51008/ |title=Natalie Portman, Fiancé Millepied Push President Obama for Gay Marriage|author=Riley, Jennifer |date=June 9, 2011 |work=|publisher=Christian Post  |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including numerous celebrities, civic leaders, and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name="christianpost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink News2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/03/14/us-celebrities-and-entrepreneurs-call-on-obama-to-support-gay-marriage-equality/ |title=US celebrities and entrepreneurs call on Obama to support gay marriage equality|author=Park, James  |date=March 14, 2011 |work=|publisher=Pink News  |accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign ended on May 9, 2012, when President Obama became the first sitting president of the United States to say he supports marriage for same-sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/freedom-to-marry-hails-president-obamas-historic-support-for-the-freedom-to/ |title=Freedom to Marry Hails President Obama's historic support for the freedom to marry |author= |date= |work=|publisher=Freedom to Marry |accessdate=August 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2012/07/30/democratic-platform-draft-includes-marriage-equality-plank-sources/ |title=Democratic platform draft includes marriage equality plank: sources |date=July 30, 2012 |first=Chris |last=Johnson |work=[[The Washington Blade]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, Freedom to Marry also launched a campaign to persuade the Democratic Party to include marriage for same-sex couples as a plank in the party platform at the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]]. The campaign contributed to outspoken support from 22 Democratic Senators, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Chair of the Democratic National Convention Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Caroline Kennedy and nine other co-chairs of President Obama's reelection campaign, and more than 40,000 Americans who added their names to Freedom to Marry's online petition.

On July 29, the Democratic Party Platform Drafting Committee included a freedom to marry plank in the draft of the platform. The draft was ratified at the Democratic National Convention in September, making the Democratic Party the first major U.S. political party to officially support marriage for same-sex couples in the national party platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolcer|first1=Julie|title=Democrats Approve Marriage Equality Platform|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2012/09/04/democrats-approve-marriage-equality-platform|accessdate=May 24, 2016|publisher=The Advocate|date=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mayors for the Freedom to Marry===
In January 2012, Freedom to Marry launched the ''Mayors for the Freedom to Marry'' campaign (also known as ''Mayors for Marriage''), encouraging mayors of cities throughout the United States to endorse marriage equality for their localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-01-20/news/ct-met-rahm-emanuel-gay-marriage-0120-20120120_1_mayor-rahm-emanuel-gay-marriage-political-support |title=Emanuel joins U.S. mayors supporting same-sex marriage; Municipal leaders launching a national push |date=January 20, 2012 |first=John |last=Byrne |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 500 mayors from nearly all 50 states had joined the campaign by the time marriage was won in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/marriage-equality/2013/01/18/mayors-marriage-equality-group-grows-threefold-first-year |title=Mayors' Marriage Equality Group Grows Threefold |date=January 18, 2013 |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 13, 2012, San Antonio Mayor [[Julián Castro]], Baltimore Mayor [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]], and West Sacramento Mayor [[Christopher Cabaldon]] published a column, [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/01/29/gay-marriage-obama-mayors/1868447/ Gay marriage a question of justice], in [[USA Today]].

===Fundraising===
As the largest funder of the marriage movement, Freedom to Marry played a pivotal role in attracting broad foundation and individual donors. Donors spanned the political spectrum, from hedge fund giant Paul Singer, the founder and CEO of Elliott Management and a major Republican bundler, to acclaimed philanthropists Jon Stryker and Tim Gill, major supporters of Democratic candidates.

For example, in March 2012, Freedom to Marry launched the "Win More States Fund," which identified battleground states where funding was most critically needed. The 2012 states included [[Same-sex marriage in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Same-sex marriage in Maine|Maine]], [[Same-sex marriage in Washington|Washington]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey|New Jersey]], and later [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Maryland|Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/freedom-to-marry-announces-win-more-states-fund-for-2012/ |title=Freedom to Marry announces "Win More States Fund" for 2012 |date=March 22, 2012 |first=Angela |last=Dallara |work=Freedom to Marry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to raise at least $3 million to funnel into these state campaigns. The organization met this initial goal in early August 2012 and continued fundraising through the rest of the year, becoming the largest out-of-state funder in three of the state ballot-measure victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/win-more-states-fund-reaches-3-million-goal-for-investment-in-state-campaig |title='Win More States Fund' reaches $3 million goal for investment in state campaigns |date=August 13, 2012 |first=Adam |last=Polaski |work=Freedom to Marry}}&lt;/ref&gt; All six of the states in the Win More States Fund won in 2012 - with Maine, Maryland, and Washington passing marriage for the first time at the ballot in the November 2012 election. Minnesota became the first state to block an anti-marriage amendment at the ballot (and passed a proactive marriage bill in the next legislative session).  New Hampshire successfully blocked a measure to repeal marriage, and New Jersey passed marriage in the state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/12/the-gay-marriage-plot-inside-this-years-other-high-stakes-campaign/265865/ |title=The Marriage Plot: Inside This Year's Epic Campaign for Gay Equality |date=December 11, 2012 |first=Molly |last=Ball |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Freedom to Marry launched the second round of states for the Win More States Fund with a goal of raising and investing $2 million into campaigns to win marriage in Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/freedom-to-marry-announces-2013-drive-to-invest-2-million-in-win-more-state |title=Freedom to Marry announces 2013 drive to invest $2 million in Win More States Fund |date=February 6, 2013 |first=Adam |last=Polaski |work=Freedom to Marry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, Freedom to Marry raised over $60 million to win marriage nationwide.  This money was invested into state, national, and federal programs, and directly into campaigns on the ground.

===Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry===
Young Conservatives for the Freedom to Marry is a campaign to highlight and build support for the freedom to marry among young [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] across America. They represent young conservatives across the country that agree all Americans should be able to share in the freedom to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/young-conservatives-for-the-freedom-to-marry |title=Young Conservatives For The Freedom To Marry|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable members of Young Conservatives Leadership Committee include [[S.E. Cupp]], [[Abby Huntsman]], and [[Meghan McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/young-conservatives-leadership-committee |title=Young Conservatives Leadership Committee|accessdate=April 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort is managed by conservative activist Tyler Deaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/young-conservatives-are-setting-out-on-a-crusade-against-homophobic-party-language-20140604 |title=Young Conservatives Are Setting Out on a Crusade Against Homophobic Party Language|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2014 the campaign launched a national effort to "reform the [[Republican National Committee|RNC]] platform." The "reform the platform" campaign launched in New Hampshire, consisting of a plan focused on the presidential primary states and "leading up to the Republican National Convention in 2016."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nhjournal.com/updated-young-conservatives-for-freedom-to-marry-in-nh/ |title=Young Conservatives for Freedom to Marry' in NH to launch campaign to reform RNC platform|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14685">The '''General Convention''' is the primary governing and legislative body of the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]. With the exception of the [[Bible]], the [[Book of Common Prayer]], and the Constitution and [[Canon law (Episcopal Church in the United States)|Canons]], it is the ultimate authority in the Episcopal Church, being the bureaucratic facility through which the collegial function of the episcopate is exercised. General Convention comprises two houses: the [[House of Deputies]] and the [[House of Bishops]].&lt;ref name=09ConstArtISec.1&gt;The Episcopal Church (2009), ''Constitution and Canons'', Constitution Article I Section 1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It meets regularly once every three years; however, the House of Bishops meets regularly in between sessions of General Convention. The Bishops have the right to call special meetings of General Convention.&lt;ref name=09CanonI.1.3.a&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 3 (a), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[diocesan bishop|diocesan]], [[Coadjutor Bishop|coadjutor]], [[suffragan bishop|suffragan]], and [[Assistant Bishop|assistant bishops]] of the Episcopal Church, whether active or retired, have seat and vote in the House of Bishops.&lt;ref name=09ConstArtISec.2&gt;Constitution Article I Section 2, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Each diocese of the Episcopal Church, as well as the [[Navajoland Area Mission]] and the [[Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe]], are entitled to representation in the House of Deputies by four [[clergy]] deputies, either [[presbyter]]s or [[deacon]]s, canonically resident in the diocese and four [[Laity|lay]] deputies who are [[confirmation|confirmed]] [[communicant]]s in good standing.&lt;ref name=09ConstArtISec.4&gt;Constitution Article I Section 4, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Episcopal Church of Liberia is entitled to representation in the House of Deputies by two [[clergy]] deputies and two [[Laity|lay]] deputies, all with seat and voice but no vote. The Official Youth Presence is a group of eighteen high school youth, two from each [[Ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses of the Episcopal Church|province]]. They also have seat and voice but no vote.  Resolutions must pass both houses in order to take effect.

The convention is divided into committees which consider resolutions. Resolutions arise from four different sources: 1) "A" resolutions from interim bodies whose work is collected in what is referred to as the "Blue Book" 2) "B" resolutions which come from Bishops 3) "C" resolutions which come from diocesan conventions and 4) "D" resolutions which originate from Deputies. Each properly submitted resolution is referred to a convention committee which makes its recommendation to the House.  When one house has acted on the resolution it is sent to the other house for consideration.

==Officers==

===Presiding Bishop===
The [[Chairman|presiding officer]] of the House of Bishops is the [[Presiding Bishop#Episcopal Church in the USA|Presiding Bishop]]. Both houses take part in the selection of a new Presiding Bishop.&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon2.Sec.1&gt;Title I Canon 2 Section 1 pp. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Joint Nominating Committee for the Election of the Presiding Bishop are elected from both houses. The House of Deputies elects one clerical and one lay delegate from each province, and the House of Bishops elects one bishop from every province to sit on the joint committee. When a new Presiding Bishop is to be elected, the houses meet together in a joint session, and the nominating committee nominates at least three bishops. During the joint session, any deputy or bishop can nominate additional candidates. The House of Bishops elects the Presiding Bishop from among all nominees. The results of the election are reported to the House of Deputies, which then votes to confirm or not to confirm the election.

===Other officers===
The presiding officers of the House of Deputies are the president and vice president.

A treasurer is elected by the two houses at every regular meeting of General Convention.&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec7.a&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 7 (a-b), pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The treasurer formulates the budget of the Episcopal Church, receives and disburses all money collected under the authority of the convention, and with the approval of the Presiding Bishop invests surplus funds.&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec7.7.a-b,11&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 7 (a-b), 11, pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; If the office of treasurer becomes vacant, the Presiding Bishop and the President of the House of Deputies appoints a treasurer until a new election is held. The treasurer of the General Convention and the Executive Council is Kurt Barnes.&lt;ref name=GCsec&gt;The Episcopal Church, [http://generalconvention.org/officers/treasurer Treasurer], accessed January 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

At each regular meeting of General Convention, the secretary of the House of Deputies is by concurrent action of both houses made the secretary of the General Convention. The secretary oversees the publishing of the Journal of the General Convention.&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec1.j&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 1 (j), pp. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the secretary also notifies the bishops and secretaries of every diocese to actions of General Convention, especially alterations to the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' and the constitution of the Episcopal Church. If the offices of president and vice president become vacant during the triennium, the secretary performs the duties of president until the next meeting of General Convention.  The Secretary is also the corporate secretary of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, the corporate body of the Episcopal Church, and one of the four senior officers of the church. The Rev. Canon Dr. Michael Barlowe is the Secretary of the House of Deputies, having been appointed upon the retirement of his predecessor, the Rev. Dr. Gregory Straub in 2013.

Dr. Barlowe is also the Executive Officer of the General Convention, a position filled by joint appointment of the Presiding Bishop and the President of the House of Deputies. The Executive Officer "oversees all aspects of the work of Church governance, from site selection through supervision and funding of the work mandated by the convention".&lt;ref name=HoDsecretary&gt;The Episcopal Church, [http://generalconvention.org/officers/exec_off Executive Officer and Secretary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106153239/http://generalconvention.org/officers/exec_off |date=2011-01-06 }}, accessed January 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He supervises the secretary, treasurer, and manager of the General Convention and heads the executive office of the General Convention which coordinates the work of the committees, commissions, boards, and agencies (CCAB's).&lt;ref name=09TitleI.Canon1.Sec13&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 13, pp. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standing commissions==
Interim bodies, meeting in between sessions of General Convention, include the Executive Council and various standing commissions which study and draft policy proposals for consideration and report back to General Convention. Each standing commission consists of three bishops, three priests or deacons, and six laypersons. Priests, deacons, and lay persons are not required to be deputies. Bishops are appointed by the Presiding Bishop while the other clergy and laypersons are appointed by the president of the House of Deputies. Members are appointed to rotating terms so that the term for half of the members expires at the conclusion of each regular meeting of the General Convention.&lt;ref name=09CanonI.1.2.a-c&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 2 (a-c), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The standing commissions are:&lt;ref name=09CanonI.1.2.n&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 2 (n), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presiding Bishop and the President of the House of Deputies are [[ex officio]] members of all commissions and can appoint personal representatives to attend commission meetings without the right to vote. They jointly appoint Executive Council members as [[wikt:liaison|liaison]] persons to provide communication between the council and each commission. These liaison persons are not commission members and cannot vote; though, they do have voice. The Presiding Bishop also appoints a staff member to assist each commission in its work.&lt;ref name=09CanonI.1.2.d-e&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 2 (d-e), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Either house may refer matters to a commission, but one house cannot instruct a commission to take any action without the consent of the other house.&lt;ref name=09CanonI.1.2.h&gt;Title I Canon 1 Section 2 (h), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
The [[American Revolution]] was very disruptive to the Episcopal churches in the [[United States]]. There had been no Anglican dioceses or bishops in the [[13 colonies]] before the Revolution, thus when the American congregations were separated from the [[Church of England]], "the chain which held them together [was] broken". In 1782, [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]], the father of the Episcopal Church, wrote in his pamphlet ''The Case of the Episcopal Churches in the United States Considered'', "it would seem, that their future continuance can be provided for only by voluntary associations for union and good government".&lt;ref name=Case&gt;William White (1782), ''The Case of the Episcopal Churches in the United States Considered'': Chapter I, [http://anglicanhistory.org/ Project Canterbury], accessed January 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In America, the central unit of the church would be the congregation, rather than the diocese.&lt;ref name=Podmore127&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Podmore| first =Colin |authorlink= Colin Podmore | title = A Tale of Two Churches: The Ecclesiologies of The Episcopal Church and the Church of England Compared  | journal = International Journal for the Study of the Christian Church| volume =8| issue =2| page =127| date =May 2008| doi=10.1080/14742250801930822}}&lt;/ref&gt; White, a disciple of [[John Locke]], believed that the church, like the state, should be a democracy. He proposed that congregations in each state should unite to form an annual convention (as opposed to a "convocation" or "synod", terms which denote a body called together by a bishop) of clergy and lay representatives of the congregations. In White's plan, the state conventions would send representatives to three provincial conventions which would elect representatives to the General Convention every three years.&lt;ref name=Podmore128-129&gt;Podmore 2008, pp. 128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution written in 1789 was very similar to White's plan, except that state conventions would elect representatives directly to the General Convention. Bishops would be democratically elected and responsible to the General Convention and their respective state (later diocesan) conventions. Bishops would be "servants of the Church and not its lords".&lt;ref name=Gundrum2&gt;James R. Gundrum, [http://generalconvention.org/gc "The General Convention: Understood Authority or Ecclesiastical Chaos"], Arrington Lectures 1982, University of the South, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often said that the Constitutions of the United States and the Episcopal Church were written by the same people. While this is not true, both were written around the same time in Philadelphia by people who knew each other and who sought to "replace hierarchical rule with egalitarian, democratic government".&lt;ref name=Podmore128&gt;Podmore 2008, pp. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Deputies is the older of the two houses having been formed in 1785. William White was the first President of the House of Deputies. The House of Bishops was formed in 1789 to win the support of those who wanted a greater role for bishops. The House of Deputies had the advantage because with an 80 percent majority it could override a veto of the House of Bishops until 1808 when both houses were given absolute vetos.&lt;ref name=Podmore138&gt;Podmore 2008, pp. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; White became the first [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania|Bishop of Pennsylvania]] and the first Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church.

The '''Genoa Social Forum''' is a coalition of movements, political parties and societies opposed to [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[globalisation]].  It was created in 2000, a year before the scheduled [[27th G8 summit]] in [[Genoa]] in 2001, and included several associations - and hundreds of smaller ones - largely but not solely from Italy.  Although it made several requests to meet the institutional representatives, as a forerunner of a counter-forum, on June 24, 2001 they were met by police chief Gianni De Gennaro.  Its national spokesperson was [[Vittorio Agnoletto]], former [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] for the [[Communist Refoundation Party]].

The '''governance of the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]''', the organisation which is the main confederation of [[students' union]]s within the [[United Kingdom]], has recently undergone radical reform. The article explains the background to the reform process and the current system of governance.

==Background==
Debates over governance reform dominated the National Conference of 2008. Reform proposals were rejected in 2008 in a vote where 692 voted for the proposals and 358 voted against, but a two-thirds majority was required.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/apr/02/highereducation.uk?intcmp=239 Students vote against union's governance changes | Education | Education] ''The Guardian''. Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' characterised the reform proposals as 'Blairite'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2008/apr/01/blairiterevolutioninnusis Blairite revolution in NUS is defeated | Education | guardian.co.uk] ''The Guardian''. Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the reforms characterised them as an attack on the democratic structure of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/27/nus.reform.plan Letters: Left challenge on NUS reform plan | Education] ''The Guardian''. Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; that would lead to a reduction in minority representation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jan/16/lawrence-nus-blackstudents?intcmp=239 Doreen Lawrence opposes NUS reforms | Education | guardian.co.uk] ''The Guardian''. Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporters argued that the reform proposals would replace an outdated system of governance and lead to a more innovative corporate structure. Two extraordinary conferences were held to ratify the reform proposals a measure criticised as undemocratic given that there is no requirement for students unions to hold cross-campus elections for extraordinary conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.cgcu.net/news/1875 Live! - NUS Calls Second Extraordinary Conference]. Live.cgcu.net (2008-12-05). Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The first extraordinary conference was held in Leicester where the reforms passed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.cgcu.net/news/1637 Live! - NUS Votes for Reform]. Live.cgcu.net (2007-12-04). Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The second conference was held in [[Wolverhampton]] where  614 delegates at the conference voting in favour of the proposals and 142 voted against them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officeronline.co.uk/events/nationalevents/274911.aspx officeronline.co.uk]. officeronline.co.uk.

==Zones==
There currently exists five policy zones.
*Higher Education &lt;ref name="officeronline2"&gt;[http://www.officeronline.co.uk//library/governance/275765.aspx officeronline.co.uk]. officeronline.co.uk. Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Further Education&lt;ref name="officeronline2"/&gt;
*Union Development &lt;ref name="officeronline2"/&gt;
*Welfare&lt;ref name="officeronline2"/&gt;
*Society and Citizenship&lt;ref name="officeronline2"/&gt;

Each zone is made up of a committee of elected students.&lt;ref&gt;http://resource.nusonline.co.uk/media/resource/NUS_Reform-opening_doors_Dec09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual Conference==
The National Union of Students holds an annual conference each year. Any member of a Union affiliated to the National Union of Students can stand to be a delegate.

==Liberation campaigns==
{{further|National Union of Students LGBT Campaign}}

Liberation campaigns are autonomous and hold their own conferences.

==Trustee Board==
According to the NUS the role of the Trustee Board is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] Trustee Board will work to ensure a sound, healthy and legally compliant organisation - allowing an elected Executive Council of students to concentrate on campaigning and representing students with confidence and integrity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://www.nus.org.uk/PageFiles/300/NUS%20Student%20Trustee%20Pack.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Trustee Board is made up of:

*The NUS President&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*The five other members of the [[National Executive Council]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*Six members elected at NUS National Conference&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
*Four lay trustees selected on the basis of their skills and experience&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The current student trustees are:

==Democratic Procedures Committee==
The Democratic Procedures Committee are a committee elected at NUS national Conference to ensure that the NUS' democratic procedures are followed. The nomination form for election to the Democratic Procedures Committee describes the remit of the committee as thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[The] Democratic Procedures Committee are responsible for the democracy of
NUS - the accessibility of its conference and the fair policy processes of the
National Union as a whole. Among other things they are responsible for the motions and amendments
process, the accessibility of the Conference venue for all delegates and the
administration of conference procedures during the meeting itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://resource.nusonline.co.uk/media/resource/DPCNoms.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Democratic Procedures Committee were criticised for their decision to cut the delegation size of some Universities at NUS Conference a move which is seen as reducing the diversity of delegations sent to conference.&lt;ref name="free-education638"&gt;[http://www.free-education.org.uk/?p=638 NUS slashes annual conference delegations - No more cuts! : Education Not For Sale]. Free-education.org.uk (2009-10-21). Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officeronline.co.uk/blogs/bellaviaribeiro-addy/276830.aspx officeronline.co.uk]. officeronline.co.uk. Retrieved on 2010-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of this decision argue that it addresses a long-standing imbalance between delegate sizes for higher education and further education institutions.&lt;ref name="free-education638"/&gt;

Members are elected to the Democratic Procedures Committee are elected on a two-year term. The current make up is:

=="Special Regions" and "Area Organisations==
{{main|National Union of Students Scotland|National Union of Students Wales|National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland|List of NUS regional Students Areas}}
&lt;!--note that the different areas committees of the NUS and NUS Areas have been merged as per [[WP:ORG]] --&gt;
'''National Union of Students Areas''' are support organisations, affiliation to which is open to individual [[students' unions]] which are usually (but not always) already affiliated members of the UK-wide National Union of Students of the United Kingdom ("NUS"). Membership of an Area organisation is optional (determined by the normal democratic process at each students' union) and is paid for by subscription in addition to the cost of affiliation to the national body.

Area organisations meet together to support each other through the ''Areas Political Convention'' (formerly the ''Areas National Convention''), and are able to attend the National Union's annual conference as non-voting observers. Additionally Area Conveners have sometimes been members of the Executive Committees of the "special regions" (Scotland ([[NUS Scotland]]), Wales ([[NUS Wales]]), and Northern Ireland ([[NUS-USI]]).) 

The position of "Areas" within the [[Constitution]] of the National Union has long been somewhat controversial. They do not feature in all printed editions of the Constitution, but have not been officially dissolved by the decision-making Annual Conference of the national body. They are nominally autonomous or semi-autonomous, but often use some of the same branding and certainly have access to the resources of their regional and national offices.

The current National Union of Students website has this to say about areas:
{{Quotation|Area organisations, recognised by NUS, provide localised support to students’ unions through campaigns, development and training. They consist of students’ unions that choose to affiliate to the Area within a geographical boundary determined by NUS. Area organisations further the work of NUS within their boundary, and must do so in accordance with the aims, objects and policy of the national union.}}

At one time almost all NUS regions contained several Area organisations; Scotland for example was divided into "NUS North of Scotland Area", "NUS West of Scotland Area" and "NUS East of Scotland Area". In this example, the East of Scotland organisation tended to work very closely with the national (Scottish) organisation due to being based in the same city, [[Edinburgh]]. In more remote parts of the country, the Area organisations are intended to form a useful first point of contact and readily accessible person to assist the local student unions.

Areas normally have a "Convener" who is generally a current student or one who has just graduated, and will take a year, theoretically (but not always) paid, to work for the Area — known as a "sabbatical" in the case of current students, and in this sense following the model of the sabbatical officers of students' unions at individual educational institutions. Occasionally the Convener would serve two or even more years in office. Those Areas able to afford the costs may send their Convener to a training session provided by the National Union. In any event, the regional organisation will normally provide training and support.

Because of their local perspective and autonomous nature, it is not uncommon for Areas to be involved in conflicts with the national organisation. Conversely, political groupings (and the fulfilling of obvious functions and shared goals) within the bodies sometimes draws them into very close co-operation.

===West Midlands Area National Union of Students===

{{further|List of Constituent Members of West Midlands Area NUS}}
'''West Midlands Area National Union of Students (WMANUS)''' is the oldest of the current National Union of Students Areas and operates as a semi-autonomous organisation of the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom. WMANUS works with affiliated Students' Unions in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] of [[England]] on campaigns, training, union development and other issues of relevance to students in the region. Area organisations are now starting to re-establish themselves across England with the establishment of the South East Area National Union of Student (SEANUS) and the Anglian Union of Students (ANGUS) - with others looking to follow. 

WMANUS has two full-time convenors who are supported by a part-time Executive Committee. It holds two Conferences (Spring and Winter) every year to discuss policy, elect its new Executive committee and determine the direction and work of the Area. Its main aims are to represent all students of affiliated Student Union/Associations/Guilds on educational and welfare issues across the West Midlands region. It runs regional wide campaigns as well as specific training events for its Constituent Members (CMs).

'''Greywater''' ([[spelling differences|also spelled]] '''graywater''', '''grey water''' and '''gray water''') or '''sullage''' is all [[wastewater]] generated in households or office buildings from streams without fecal contamination, i.e. all streams except for the wastewater from toilets. Sources of greywater include, [[sinks]], [[shower]]s, [[bathtub|baths]], clothes [[washing machines]] or dish washers. As greywater contains fewer [[pathogen]]s than domestic wastewater, it is generally safer to handle and easier to treat and reuse onsite for [[Flush toilet|toilet flushing]], landscape or crop [[irrigation]], and other non-potable uses.

The application of greywater reuse in [[Integrated urban water management|urban water system]]s provides substantial benefits for both the [[water supply]] subsystem by reducing the demand for fresh [[clean water]] as well as the wastewater subsystems by reducing the amount of wastewater required to be conveyed and treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Advantages of integrated and sustainability based assessment for metabolism based strategic planning of urban water systems|last = Behzadian|first = k|date = 2015|journal = Science of the Total Environment|doi = 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.04.097|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kapelan|first2 = Z|publisher = Elsevier|volume = 527–528|pages = 220–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treated greywater has many uses, for example toilet flushing or irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_m/m-106.html|title=NM State greywater advice|last=Duttle|first=Marsha|date=January 1990|publisher=[[New Mexico State University]]|accessdate=23 January 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213002120/http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_m/m-106.html|archivedate=13 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

[[File:Greywater treatment garden (3212483147).jpg|thumb|Urban decentralized greywater treatment with [[constructed wetland]] in [[Oslo]]]]

===Definition===

Greywater is all [[wastewater]] that is generated in household or office building sources without [[fecal]] contamination. Therefore, by definition, greywater does not include the discharge of toilets or highly fecally contaminated wastewater, which is designated [[sewage]] or [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and contains [[human waste]].

=== Quality ===
Greywater usually contains some traces of [[excreta]] and is therefore not free of pathogens.&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; The excreta comes from washing a person's anal area in the bath and shower, or from the laundry (washing underwear and nappies). The quality of greywater can deteriorate rapidly during storage because it often is warm and contains some nutrients and organic matter (e.g. dead skin cells), as well as pathogens. Stored greywater also leads to odour nuisances for the same reason.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Quantity ===
In households with conventional flush toilets, greywater makes up about 65% of the total wastewater produced by that household.&lt;ref name="tilley" /&gt; It may be a good source of water for reuse, because there is a close relationship between the production of greywater and the potential demand for toilet flushing water.

===Practical aspects===

Misconnections of pipes can cause greywater tanks to contain a percentage of blackwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tolksdorf|first=J.|last2=Cornel|first2=P.|date=2017-05-19|title=Separating grey- and blackwater in urban water cycles – sensible in the view of misconnections?|url=http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/early/2017/05/19/wst.2017.293|journal=Water Science and Technology|language=en|pages=wst2017293|doi=10.2166/wst.2017.293|issn=0273-1223|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816194343/http://wst.iwaponline.com/content/early/2017/05/19/wst.2017.293|archivedate=2017-08-16|df=|volume=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small traces of [[human feces|feces]] that enter the greywater stream via [[effluent]] from the shower, sink, or washing machine do not pose practical hazards under normal conditions, as long as the greywater is used correctly (for example, percolated from a [[dry well]] or used correctly in farming irrigation).

==Treatment processes==

{{Further|Sewage treatment plant| Reclaimed water}}

The separate treatment of greywater falls under the concept of [[Source separation (recycling)|source separation]] which is one principle commonly applied in [[ecological sanitation]] approaches. The main advantage of keeping greywater separate from toilet wastewater is that the pathogen load is much reduced and the greywater is therefore easier to treat and reuse.&lt;ref name="tilley"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-3-906484-57-0 |url=http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN |title=Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd |last1=Tilley |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Ulrich |first2=Lukas |last3=Lüthi |first3=Christoph |last4=Reymond |first4=Philippe |last5=Zurbrügg |first5=Chris |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) |location=Duebendorf, Switzerland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20132303024500/http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN |archivedate=2017-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When greywater is mixed with toilet wastewater, it is called sewage or [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] and should be treated in [[sewage treatment]] plants or onsite sewage facility, which often is a septic system. When it is kept separate, it may open up interesting decentralized treatment and reuse options.

Greywater from kitchen sinks contains [[fat]]s, [[oil]]s and [[Yellow grease|grease]] and high loads of organic matter. It should undergo preliminary treatment to remove these substances before discharge into a grey water tank. If this is difficult to apply, it could be directed to the blackwater system or to an existing [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.vic.gov.au/~/media/Publications/891%204.pdf |title=Code of practice – on-site wastewater management, EPA-Victoria, Au, Publication 891 4-1|last=|first=|date=July 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most greywater is easier to treat and recycle than blackwater (sewage), because of lower levels of contaminants. If collected using a separate plumbing system from blackwater, domestic greywater can be [[water recycling|recycled]] directly within the home, garden or company and used either immediately or processed and stored. If stored, it must be used within a very short time or it will begin to putrefy due to the organic solids in the water. Recycled greywater of this kind is never [[potable|safe to drink]], but a number of treatment steps can be used to provide water for washing or flushing toilets.

The treatment processes that can be used are in principle the same as those used for sewage treatment, except that they are usually installed on a smaller scale (decentralized level), often at household or building level:
* Biological systems such as [[constructed wetland]]s or [[green wall|living walls]] and bioreactors or more compact systems such as [[membrane bioreactor]]s which are a variation of the [[activated sludge]] process and is also used to treat sewage.
* Mechanical systems ([[sand filter|sand filtration]], [[lava filter|lava filter systems]] and systems based on [[UV]] radiation)
In constructed wetlands, the plants use contaminants of greywater, such as food particles, as nutrients in their growth. However, salt and soap residues can be toxic to microbial and plant life alike, but can be absorbed and degraded through [[constructed wetlands]] and aquatic plants such as [[sedges]], [[Juncaceae|rushes]], and grasses.

==Reuse==
{{Further|Resource recovery|Integrated urban water management}}
The global water resources are worsening. According to a report from United Nations states that 2.7 billion people will face the problem of water shortage by 2025, which means almost 1/2-1/3 of the total population of the world will be affected by this problem. Reusing the [[wastewater]] has become a good way to solve this problem, and wastewater reuse is also called recycled or [[reclaimed water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Juan |first=Yi-Kai|last2=Chen|first2=Yi|last3=Lin|first3=Jing-Ming|date=19 November 2016|title=Greywater Reuse System Design and Economic Analysis for Residential Buildings in Taiwan|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/8/11/546/htm|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits ===
Demand on conventional water supplies and pressure on sewage treatment systems is reduced by the use of greywater. Re-using greywater also reduces the volume of sewage effluent entering watercourses which can be ecologically beneficial. In times of drought, especially in urban areas, greywater use in gardens or toilet systems helps to achieve some of the goals of [[ecologically sustainable development]].

The potential ecological benefits of greywater recycling include

* Reduced freshwater extraction from rivers and [[aquifers]]
* Less impact from [[septic tank]] and [[water treatment plant|treatment plant]] infrastructure
* Reduced energy use and chemical pollution from treatment
* [[Groundwater recharge]]
* Reclamation of nutrients
* Greater quality of [[surface water|surface]] and [[ground water]] when preserved by the natural purification in the top layers of soil than generated water treatment processes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.letsgogreen.com/greywater-recycling.html Lets Go Green Practical Alternatives to Sewer and Septic Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130042458/http://www.letsgogreen.com/greywater-recycling.html |date=2009-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[U.S. Southwest]] and the Middle East where available water supplies are limited, especially in view of a rapidly growing population, a strong imperative exists for adoption of alternative water technologies.

The potential economic benefits of greywater recycling include

* Can reduce the demand for [[fresh water]], and when people reduce the use of fresh water, the cost of domestic water consumption is significantly reduced, while alleviating the pressure of global water resources.
* Can reduce the amount of wastewater entering the sewer or on-site treatment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sustainable.com.au/greywater-treatment.html|title=Sustainable Earth Technologies|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
Greywater use for irrigation appears to be a safe practice. A 2015 epidemiological study found no additional burden of disease among greywater users irrigating arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;Busgang A, Friedler E, Ovadia O, Gross A. Epidemiological study for the assessment of health risks associated with greywater reuse for irrigation in arid regions. Science of the Total Environment [serial online]. December 25, 2015;538:230-239.&lt;/ref&gt; The safety of reuse of greywater as potable water has also been studied. A few organic micropollutants including benzene were found in greywater in significant concentrations but most pollutants were in very low concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Etchepare R, van der Hoek J. Health risk assessment of organic micropollutants in greywater for potable reuse. Water Research [serial online]. April 2015;72:186-198.&lt;/ref&gt; Faecal contamination, peripheral pathogens (e.g., skin and mucous tissue), and food-derived pathogens are the three major sources of pathogens in greywater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maimon|first=Adi|last2=Friedler|first2=Eran|last3=Gross|first3=Amit|date=27 March 2014|title=Parameters affecting greywater quality and its safety for reuse|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714004859?via%3Dihub|access-date=28 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.133|volume=487|journal=Science of the Total Environment|pages=20–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greywater reuse in toilet flushing and garden irrigation may produce [[aerosol]]s. These could transmit [[Legionella|legionella disease]] and bring a potential health risk for people. However, the result of the research shows that the health risk due to reuse of greywater either for garden irrigation or toilet flushing was not significantly higher than the risk associated with using clear water for the same activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanky|first=Marina|last2=Sharaby|first2=Yehonatan|last3=et al.|date=14 June 2017|title=Greywater reuse - Assessment of the health risk induced by Legionella pneumophila|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135417307212?via%3Dihub#sec3|access-date=28 November 2017|work=Sustainable Earth Technologies|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2017.08.068|volume=125|pages=410–417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irrigation===
Most greywater should be assumed to have some blackwater-type components, including [[pathogens]]. Greywater should be applied below the surface where possible (e.g., via drip line on top of the soil, under [[mulch]]; or in mulch-filled trenches) and not sprayed, as there is a danger of inhaling the water as an [[aerosol]].

In any greywater system, it is important to avoid toxic materials such as bleaches, [[bath salts]], artificial dyes, [[chlorine]]-based cleansers, strong [[acids]]/[[alkali]], [[solvents]], and products containing [[boron]], which is toxic to plants at high levels. Most cleaning agents contain [[sodium]] [[salts]], which can cause excessive soil [[alkalinity]], inhibit seed germination, and destroy the structure of soils by dispersing clay. Soils watered with greywater systems can be amended with [[gypsum]] ([[calcium sulfate]]) to reduce [[pH]]. Cleaning products containing [[ammonia]] are safe to use, as plants can use it to obtain nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extension.umass.edu/landscape/fact-sheets/recycling-gray-water-home-gardens|title=Recycling Gray Water for Home Gardens|publisher=University of Massachusetts|author1=Dr. Allen V.

Some greywater may be applied directly from the sink to the garden or container field, receiving further treatment from [[soil microbes|soil life]] and plant roots.

The use of non-toxic and low-sodium soap and personal care products is recommended to protect vegetation when reusing greywater for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;US EPA.

Retrieved: 21 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor reuse===
Recycled greywater from showers and bathtubs can be used for flushing toilets in most European and Australian jurisdictions and in United States jurisdictions that have adopted the [[International Plumbing Code]].

Such a system could provide an estimated 30% reduction in water use for the average household. The danger of [[biological contamination]] is avoided by using:
* A cleaning tank, to eliminate floating and sinking items
* An intelligent control mechanism that flushes the collected water if it has been stored long enough to be hazardous; this completely avoids the problems of filtration and chemical treatment

Greywater recycling without treatment is used in certain [[dwellings]] for applications where potable water is not required (e.g., garden and land irrigation, [[toilet flushing]]). It may also be used in dwellings when the greywater (e.g., from [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater]]) is already fairly clean to begin with and/or has not been polluted with non-degradable chemicals such as non-natural soaps (thus using natural cleaning products instead). It is not recommended to use water that has been in the greywater filtration system for more than 24 hours as bacteria builds up, affecting the water that is being reused.

Due to the limited treatment technology, the treated greywater still contains some chemicals and bacteria, so some safety issues should be observed when using the treated greywater around the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.choice.com.au/home-improvement/water/saving-water/articles/guide-to-greywater-systems| title=choice|access-date=28 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat reclamation===
Devices are currently available that capture heat from residential and industrial greywater, through a process called drainwater heat recovery, greywater heat recovery, or hot [[water heat recycling]].

Rather than flowing directly into a water heating device, incoming cold water flows first through a heat exchanger where it is pre-warmed by heat from greywater flowing out from such activities as dishwashing, or showering. Typical household devices receiving greywater from a shower can recover up to 60% of the heat that would otherwise go to waste.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Regulations==
=== United States ===
[[Government regulation]] governing domestic greywater use for landscape irrigation (diversion for reuse) is still a developing area and continues to gain wider support as the actual risks and benefits are considered and put into clearer perspective.

"Greywater" (by pure legal definition) is considered in some jurisdictions to be "sewage" (all wastewater including greywater and toilet waste), but in the U.S. states that adopt the ''International Plumbing Code'', it can be used for subsurface irrigation and for toilet flushing, and in states that adopt the ''[[Uniform Plumbing Code]]'', it can be used in underground disposal fields that are akin to shallow sewage disposal fields.

[[Wyoming]] allows surface and subsurface irrigation and other non-specific use of greywater under a Department of Environmental Quality policy enacted in March 2010. [[California]], [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]] and some other states allow true subsurface [[drip irrigation]] with greywater. Where greywater is still considered sewage, it is bound by the same regulatory procedures enacted to ensure properly engineered septic tank and effluent disposal systems are installed for long system life and to control spread of disease and pollution. In such regulatory jurisdictions, this has commonly meant domestic greywater diversion for landscape irrigation was either not permitted or was discouraged by expensive and complex sewage system approval requirements. Wider legitimate community greywater diversion for landscape irrigation has subsequently been handicapped and resulted in greywater reuse continuing to still be widely undertaken by householders outside of and in preference to the legal avenues.

However, with [[water conservation]] becoming a necessity in a growing number of jurisdictions, business, political and community pressure has made regulators seriously reconsider the actual risks against actual benefits.

It is now recognized and accepted by an increasing number of regulators{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that the microbiological risks of greywater reuse at the single dwelling level where inhabitants already had intimate knowledge of that greywater are in reality an insignificant risk, when properly managed without the need for onerous approval processes. This is reflected in the [[New South Wales]] Government Department of Water and Energy's newly released greywater diversion rules, and the recent passage of greywater legislation in [[Montana]].&lt;ref name="montanalaw"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greywateraction.org/content/policy-recommendations-montana |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106092106/http://greywateraction.org/content/policy-recommendations-montana |archivedate=2013-01-06 |df= }} 2007 greywater legislation in Montana&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 Legislative Session, the state of Montana passed a bill expanding greywater use into multi-family and commercial buildings. The Department of Environmental Quality has already drafted rules and design guidelines for greywater re-use systems in all these applications. Existing staff would review systems proposed for new subdivisions in conjunction with review of all other wastewater system components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Gray water law is a good step forward |newspaper= [[The Montana Standard]] |date= 2009-04-01 |url= http://mtstandard.com/news/opinion/gray-water-law-is-a-good-step-forward/article_fe1337c2-7eab-54b0-bdec-ccf0f05837c1.html |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160407021503/http://mtstandard.com/news/opinion/gray-water-law-is-a-good-step-forward/article_fe1337c2-7eab-54b0-bdec-ccf0f05837c1.html |archivedate= 2016-04-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict permit requirements in [[Austin, Texas]], led to issuance of only one residential graywater permit since 2010. A working group formed to streamline the permitting process, and in 2013, the city created new code that has eased the requirements, resulting in four more permits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf Texas Water Report: Going Deeper for the Solution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222144253/http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/water/96-1746.pdf |date=2014-02-22 }} Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Retrieved 2/11/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, a push has been made in recent years to address greywater in connection with the State's greenhouse gas reduction goals (see [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006|AB 32]]). As a large amount of energy (electricity) is used for pumping, treating and transporting potable water within the state, water conservation has been identified as one of several ways California is seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;California Air Resources Board. AB 32 Scoping Plan. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, the [[California Building Standards Commission]] (CBSC) approved the addition of Chapter 16A "Non-potable Water Reuse Systems" to the 2007 California Plumbing Code. Emergency regulations allowing greywater reuse systems were subsequently filed with the [[California Secretary of State]] August 2009 and became effective immediately upon filing. Assembly Bill 371 (Goldberg 2006) and Senate Bill 283 (DeSaulnier 2009) directed the [[California Department of Water Resources]] (DWR), in consultation with the State Department of Health Services, to adopt and submit to the CBSC regulations for a State version of Appendix J (renamed Chapter 16 Part 2) of the Uniform Plumbing Code to provide design standards to safely plumb buildings with both potable and recycled water systems. November 2009 the CBSC unanimously voted to approve the California Dual Plumbing Code that establishes statewide standards for potable and recycled water plumbing systems in commercial, retail and office buildings, theaters, auditoriums, condominiums, schools, hotels, apartments, barracks, dormitories, jails, prisons and reformatories. In addition, the [[California Department of Housing and Community Development]] has greywater standards and DWR has also proposed dual plumbing design standards.

In Arizona, greywater is defined as water with a BOD5 less than 380&amp;nbsp;mg/L, TSS&lt;430 and the Fats, Oil, and Grease (FOG) content should be less than 75&amp;nbsp;mg/L. The Arizona water has issued advice that people should avoid direct contact with grey water. Most greywater use is by underground [[drip irrigation]] since surface irrigation is not permitted.There are three types of use in Arizona: up to a quota of 400 gpd per family (close to 1500 L per day) no permission is required for greywater use, between 400 and 3000 gpd (1500 and 11,355 L per day, respectively) permission is required and above 3000 gpd (&gt;11,355 L per day) it is considered as conventional wastewater venture. 
Other limitations include restrictions on contact, restrictions on use on herbaceous food plants, exclusion of hazardous materials and effective separation from surface water run-off.

The Uniform Plumbing Code, adopted in some U.S. jurisdictions, prohibits greywater use indoors.

=== United Kingdom ===
Greywater recycling is relatively uncommon in the UK, largely because the financial cost and environmental impact of mains water is very low. Greywater systems should comply with BS8525 and the [[Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999|Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations]] in order to avoid risks to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030184123|title=BS 8525-1:2010 - Greywater systems.

Greywater from single sewered premises has the potential to be reused on site for ornamental, garden and lawn irrigation, toilet flushing. The reuse options include Horizontal flow reed bed (HFRB), Vertical flow reed bed (VFRB), Green roof water recycling system (GROW), Membrane bioreactor (MBR) and Membrane chemical reactor (MCR).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oron|first=Gideon|last2=Adel|first2=Mike|last3=Agmon|first3=Vered| last4=Frieder|first4=Eran|last5=Halperin|first5=Rami|last6=Leshem|first6=Ehud| last7=Weinberg|first7=Daniel|date= 14 March 2014|title= Greywater use in Israel and worldwide: Standards and prospects|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004313541400222X?via%3Dihub|access-date=30 November 2017|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2014.03.032|volume=58|journal=Water Research|pages=92–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Although Canada is a water-rich country, the center of the country freezes in the winter and droughts happen some summers. There are locations where watering outdoors is restricted in the dry season, some water must be transported from an outside source, or on-site costs are high. At present, the standards for greywater reuse are not strict compared with other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The National Plumbing Code, which is adopted in whole or in part by the provinces, indicates that non-potable water systems should only be used to supply toilets and underground irrigation systems, collecting rainwater with roof gutters is included as a form of greywater.&lt;ref&gt;https://tapsbath.com/wp-content/uploads/Guide-Sustainable-Plumbing-CMHC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Health Canada has published a guideline to use greywater for toilet flushing and British Columbia's building code includes subsurface irrigation with greywater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/water-quality/household-reclaimed-water-water-quality.html|title=Household Reclaimed Water - Canada.ca|first=Health|last=Canada|website=www.canada.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/waste-management/sewage/onsite-sewerage-systems/what_is_grey_water.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In Alberta "wastewater from any source cannot be used inside buildings"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/1176|title=Municipal Affairs: Reclaimed Wastewater|first=Jessica|last=Spratt|website=www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saskatchewan also treats greywater as sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowma.ca/home-owners/faqs/|title=FAQs –  Saskatchewan Onsite Wastewater Management Association|website=www.sowma.ca|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Household greywater from a single contaminated site may be reused on-site at the ornamental garden and lawn watering, toilet flushing and laundry uses, depending on the type of greywater and treatment level. Some people wisely re-use the gross weight, but others use it even worse (without any treatment), such as bathing in the bath or simply transferring laundry water to the lawn where children and pets may be exposed directly. The Department of Health and Community Services (DHCS) focuses on protecting public health and then takes action to control and minimize the public health risks associated with greywater reuse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cyprus ===
The government of Cyprus has implemented four water-saving subsidies: drilling installations, drilling with lavatories, installation of hot water circulation systems and installation of greywater recycling systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Jordan ===
The emphasis on the use of greywater in [[Jordan]] has two main purposes: water conservation and socio-economic aspects. The Amman Islamic Water Development and Management Network (INWRDAM) in Jordan promoted research on gray water reuse in Jordan. At present, greywater research in Jordan is funded mainly by the International Development Research Center (IDRC) in Ottawa, Canada, to install and use greywater systems based on the establishment of small wetland systems in private households. The cost of this system is about 500 US dollars per household.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="772">In United States agricultural policy, '''Group Risk Income Protection''' (GRIP) is a county-based revenue insurance program that is a variation of [[Group Risk Protection]] (GRP). GRIP pays a participating producer when the county revenue per acre for an insured crop falls below a trigger revenue selected by the insured producer, regardless of the actual revenue level of the individual producer. It is available on a limited basis where GRP is currently available.

}}The '''Hanrapetutyun Party''' ({{lang-hy|Հանրապետություն կուսակցություն}}), also known as '''Republic''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հանրապետություն ''Hanrapetutyun'') is a [[Radical centrism|radical-centrist]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] [[political party]] in [[Armenia]]. The party was founded by ex-members of [[Republican Party of Armenia]] and members of the [[Yerkrapah]] Volunteer Union: [[Aram Sargsyan]], [[Albert Bazeyan]], [[Vagharshak Harutiunyan]], Ara Ketikyan and others, in April, 2001.
 
At the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2003|parliamentary elections 2003]], the party won 1 out of 131 seats. In the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2007|2007 Armenian parliamentary elections]] it didn't win any seats with a popular vote of 1.65%.

In the [[Armenian parliamentary election, 2017|2017 Armenian parliamentary election]] and [[Yerevan City Council election, 2017|2017 Yerevan City Council election]], it took part in the elections as part of the [[Way Out Alliance|Way Out Alliance (YELQ)]] together with [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]] and [[Bright Armenia]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://armenianweekly.com/2017/01/24/new-opposition-bloc-formed-in-armenia/|title=New Opposition Bloc Formed in Armenia|date=2017-01-24|work=The Armenian Weekly|access-date=2018-11-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2018 Armenian Velvet Revolution|Velvet Revolution]] in 2018, [[Civil Contract (Armenia)|Civil Contract]] whose leader [[Nikol Pashinyan]] led the revolution, left the [[Way Out Alliance]] and the Hanrapetutyun Party formed an alliance with [[Bright Armenia]] called [[Bright Alliance]].

'''''Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science''''' is a 1994 book by [[biologist]] [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[mathematician]] [[Norman Levitt]].

==Summary==
Levitt states he is a leftist trying to save the "academic left" from itself by exposing misuses and abuses of science to advance political goals.

==Reception and influence==
The book inspired the 1996 [[Sokal affair|Sokal hoax]], in which [[Alan Sokal]] published a bogus paper to a [[postmodernist]] journal that did not [[Peer review|peer-review]] submissions.&lt;ref name="postmodernism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |date=2007-04-01 |author=Dawkins, Richard |title=Postmodernism Disrobed |accessdate=2010-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120082759/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/824-postmodernism-disrobed |archivedate=2011-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sokal stated in an interview that while he was initially skeptical about ''Higher Superstition'', he concluded after reading the works Gross and Levit criticized that they were describing them fairly in "about 80 percent of the cases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Anatomy-of-a-Hoax/238728?key=bB4GOexLsAk2KfnFOkgPCI0O5azbXR52m3YJxfcw-igptJkoKi_rn3RCDgSQfq6pc3g5NWVSMTIzSXBPNlRyc3YyVnBuczlCYV82MUNMWXdMY2gxYnNKdEN4NA|title=Bait and Switch: How the physicist Alan Sokal hoodwinked a group of humanists and why, 20 years later, it still matters.|first=Jennifer |last=Ruark |date=1 January 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2017 |work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Scottish National Party}}
In [[Scotland]], the '''Scottish National Party''' (SNP) is a [[centre left]], [[social democracy|social democratic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snp.org/about-us |title=About Us - Scottish National Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913014940/http://www.snp.org/about-us |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political party]] which campaigns for [[Scottish independence]]. The SNP has controlled Scotland's [[Scottish Parliament|devolved legislature]] since the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007 election]] as a minority government, and since the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011|2011 election]] as a majority government. Its leader, [[Nicola Sturgeon]], is the [[First Minister of Scotland]].

==Early years (1934-1960)==
The party was founded on 7 April 1934 as the result of a merger between the [[National Party of Scotland]] (NPS) and the [[Scottish Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eKRAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j6UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2659%2C4639120 |title=Scottish Nationalists to Unite |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |page=8 |date=1 February 1934 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ross: ''History of Scotland'', Geddes &amp; Grosset 2002, p 31&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Alexander MacEwen]] became the new party's first leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sMpAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5004%2C1105135 |title=Union of Scots Parties. Opening Conference in Glasgow. New officials elected |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=9 April 1934 |page=14 |accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was the brainchild of leading NPS figure [[John MacCormick]], who desired unity for the nationalist movement in Scotland, and, upon learning of the Scottish Party's emergence, moved to secure it.

Initially, the SNP did not support all-out independence for Scotland, but rather the establishment of a [[devolved]] [[Scottish Assembly]] within the [[United Kingdom]]. This became the party's initial position on the constitutional status of Scotland as a result of a compromise between the NPS, who did support independence, and the Scottish Party, who were devolutionists. John MacCormick wanted a merger between the two parties and knew that it would only be through the support of devolution rather than independence that the Scottish Party would be persuaded to merge.{{fact|date=December 2017}} However, the SNP quickly reverted to the NPS stance of supporting full independence for Scotland.

Professor [[Douglas Young (classicist)|Douglas Young]] was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945. Young fought for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British war effort]] against the [[Nazis]]. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.

John MacCormick left the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party's policy from supporting all out independence to [[Home Rule]] at that year's SNP conference in [[Glasgow]]. McCormick went on to form the [[Scottish Covenant Association]], a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. This Covenant in itself proved politically challenging for the SNP, as it stole their nationalist platform. It also deprived the party of many members, who left with MacCormick.

The Covenant managed to get over 2 million signatures to a petition demanding Home Rule for Scotland in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and secured support from across the parties, but it eventually faded as a political force.

The SNP's early years were characterised by a lack of electoral progress and it wasn't until 1945 that the SNP's first member was elected to the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. The party's first MP was [[Robert McIntyre]] who won a by-election for [[Motherwell (UK Parliament constituency)|Motherwell]] under unusual wartime conditions, but he lost the seat in the general election later that year.

McIntyre's brief spell did not particularly galvanise the SNP. The 1950s were characterised by low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates.  The party's former president, [[Roland Muirhead]], devoted much of his time to the [[Scottish National Congress]], a direct action organisation which competed for support with the SNP.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lynch, ''SNP: The History of the Scottish National Party'', pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

A split occurred in the SNP in 1955 (although not as large as that of 1942) when a grouping styled the [[55 Group]] started an organised campaign of internal dissent. This group was formed mainly of younger SNP members frustrated at the lack of progress of the party. This split proved to be minor and involved only a few members, mainly located in the city of [[Edinburgh]], and the new National Party of Scotland made no impact whatsoever in the long-run.

==The 1960s==
Despite the poor record the SNP had in the 1950s, by the 1960s, they were beginning to make more impact. They won a significant vote in the [[Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, 1961]], and [[William Wolfe]] did well at the [[West Lothian by-election, 1962]]. The party began to grow quickly in the 1960s with a rapid growth in the number of recognised branches. For example, in 1966 alone the SNP National Executive recognised 113 new branches of the party. 1967 was the year that the party signalled they could begin to make an impact electorally. The party polled very well at the [[Pollok]] by-election, winning some 28% of the votes cast in a constituency where they had never stood before.

Later that year, the SNP scored an even greater electoral success. [[Winnie Ewing]] won the [[Hamilton, Scotland|Hamilton]] constituency in a [[Hamilton by-election, 1967|by-election]] in 1967 with the help of national organizer [[John McAteer]]. Consequently, the SNP began to make a serious impact on the political scene. Ewing famously said on the night of her by-election victory, 'stop the world, Scotland wants to get on', and this spirit seemed to be embraced by many Scots. Her victory propelled the party into the popular conscience and many new members joined as a result.

A novel feature of the 1967 SNP Annual Conference was that the party leader [[Arthur Donaldson]] was challenged for the position of party convenor. His challenger was [[Douglas Drysdale]], who was vocally critical of Donaldson's leadership. Donaldson overwhelmingly defeated Drysdale to retain his position.  Several prominent individuals formed the [[1320 Club]], hoping to develop a wider movement in the style of the Scottish Covenant Association,&lt;ref name="harvie"&gt;Christopher Harvie, ''Scotland and Nationalism: Scottish Society and Politics 1707 to the Present'', p.172&lt;/ref&gt; but they were expelled in 1968 for advocating paramilitary activity.&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;Peter Barberis et al, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', p.409&lt;/ref&gt;

In local elections, the SNP were beginning to show they could compete also. In the 1967 Local Council elections, the SNP secured over 200,000 votes across the country making 27 gains in the burgh elections, and 42 in the counties. They managed to take control of [[Stirling]] council where former party leader Robert McIntyre became [[Provost (civil)|Provost]]. The SNP then went onto secure the largest share of the Scottish vote of any of the parties contesting the 1968 Local Council elections, winning some 40% of the vote.

Ewing's by-election victory and this improved electoral performance in the local elections helped to provoke the then UK Labour Government to establish the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]] to set up the blue-print for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. It also prompted [[Edward Heath|Edward Heath's]] announcement at the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] Conference in 1968 that if he became Prime Minister he would establish a Scottish Assembly.

Scotland's [[Unionists (Scotland)|unionist]] politicians were becoming increasingly worried at the growth of the SNP. The Labour Party in particular had cause for alarm as Scotland provided so much of their support base, and the SNP were now picking up support in their very heartlands.

At the 1969 party conference, [[William Wolfe]] was elected SNP leader in place of Arthur Donaldson.

==The 1970s==
[[File:United Kingdom general election 1974 Oct in Scotland.svg|thumb|Map of the results of the October 1974 election in Scotland; an SNP Westminster high-water mark.]]
At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], the SNP improved their vote over 1966, but did not make a serious breakthrough. Ewing lost her Hamilton seat and the only consolation for the SNP was the capture of the [[Western Isles (UK Parliament constituency)|Western Isles]], making [[Donald Stewart (MP)|Donald Stewart]] into their only MP. Thereafter, though, the SNP entered a period of sustained growth following the pattern of the 1960s: a number of strong showings in individual by-elections.

There was a minor setback in the early 1970s when a small number of party members in [[Dundee, Scotland|Dundee]] left to form a [[Labour Party of Scotland]]. This new party contested the Dundee East [[Dundee East by-election, 1973|by-election of 1973]], and the number of votes they captured was more than the Labour candidate's margin of victory over the SNP candidate, [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]]. However, in the long-run, this new party folded and most of its members returned to the SNP.

They were bolstered by their capture of the [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] seat with [[Margo MacDonald]] as their candidate from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in a [[Glasgow Govan by-election, 1973|by-election in 1973]]. This again signalled to Labour that the SNP posed an electoral threat to them and in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]] they returned 7 MPs. The failure of the Labour Party to secure an overall majority prompted them to quickly return to the polls to secure such and in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 General Election]] the SNP performed even better than they had done earlier in the year, winning 11 MPs and managing to get over 30% of the vote across Scotland. The main driving force behind the growth of the SNP in the 1970s was the discovery of oil in the [[North Sea]] off the coast of Scotland. The SNP ran a hugely successful ''[[It's Scotland's oil]]'' campaign, emphasising the way in which they believed the discovery of oil could benefit all of Scotland's citizens.

Former SNP leader William Wolfe has argued that along with this campaign, the SNP was aided by their support for the workers in the [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]], being led by [[Jimmy Reid]], as well as supporting the workers at the Scottish Daily Express when they attempted to run the paper themselves and other such campaigns.

===United Kingdom general election, 1979===
{{Main article|United Kingdom general election, 1979}}

The SNP continued to ride high in the opinion polls throughout the 1970s, and many members are convinced that if the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], led by [[David Steel]] hadn't maintained the Labour Government of the time in power, the SNP might have made further electoral gains in the resulting general election. It did well at the local elections of 1977, making 98 net gains and leaving much of Scotland under hung councils. However 1978 saw a Labour revival at the expense of the SNP, at three by-elections ([[Glasgow Garscadden by-election, 1978|Glasgow Garscadden]], [[Hamilton by-election, 1978|Hamilton]] and [[Berwick and East Lothian by-election, 1978|Berwick and East Lothian]]) and the local elections. The general election did not come until [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]], by which time the SNP's support had dwindled.

In 1979, the SNP Parliamentary Group voted against the Labour Government in a Vote of No Confidence, causing the dissolution of the government and subsequent election. The then Labour Prime Minister, [[James Callaghan]] famously described this decision by the SNP as that of "[[turkeys voting for Christmas]]". After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], the SNP had only two seats, representing a net loss of nine seats. [[Margaret Thatcher]] became the UK's Prime Minister.

====UK Government interference====
The party was accused of paranoia when its leaders claimed it was being spied upon by government agents, but this belief was eventually substantiated by declassified government files. These files proved that the government had in fact spied on the SNP in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/files-prove-that-mi5-spied-on-snp-1-1423283|title=Files prove that MI5 spied on SNP|date=16 June 2007|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, the British government used both police and agents placed within trade unions to limit the growth of the SNP the best it could.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070124051814/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050821/ai_n14915947 The Sunday Herald] &lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party, which controlled the government at the time and drew a great deal of support from Scotland, saw that the SNP had become much more than a protest vote. It is alleged that government interference is part of what helped bring about the collapse in support for the party in 1979.&lt;ref name="SNP files"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/government-snp-files-sealed-for-50-years-party-alleges-wilson-government-instigated-dirty-tricks-campaign-to-deal-with-threat-of-nationalist-upsurge-1.45295|title=Government SNP files sealed for 50 years|date=21 August 2005|accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour continues to ridicule the SNP for their claims of government interference. "The SNP appears totally paranoid. All the evidence shows they are absolutely no threat whatsoever to the British state," said a Labour spokesperson in response to the SNP's complaints. Despite these words, the Labour government has had several files on the SNP sealed for fifty years, citing reasons of national security.&lt;ref name="SNP files"/&gt;

===Factionalism after 1979===
The party went into a period of decline after the failure to secure a devolved [[Scottish Assembly]] in 1979, its poor performance in the [[united Kingdom general election, 1979|general election]] of that year, and a perceived complicity in helping Thatcher get elected by voting for the dissolution of the Labour government. A period of internal strife followed, culminating in the proscription of two internal groups, [[Siol nan Gaidheal]] and the left-wing [[79 Group]]. However, several 79 Group members would later return to prominence in the party, including [[Alex Salmond]], who would later lead the party. It proved too much for [[Margo MacDonald]] though, who was defeated by [[Douglas Henderson (SNP politician)|Douglas Henderson]] for the position of party deputy leader at the 1979 party conference, and left the SNP, angry at the treatment of the left wing of the party, although she would later return to the party and be elected as an MSP.

There was also another internal grouping formed within the party, primarily as a response to the growth of the 79 Group entitled the [[Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland]], with the support of traditionalists such as Winnie Ewing. This group sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation. If the group was successful, it would have undone the work of figures such as William Wolfe, who moved the SNP to become a clearly defined social democratic party in the 1970s.

==The 1980s==
The period of internal factionalism inside the SNP came to an end at the 1982 SNP Conference, where internal factions were banned. The 79 Group, despite their proscription, were bolstered by the collapse of the [[Scottish Labour Party (1976)|Scottish Labour Party]] (SLP) in the aftermath of the 1979 election. This resulted in the SLP's leading figure, [[Jim Sillars]] deciding to join the SNP, as did a great number of other ex-SLP members. Sillars had been a Labour Party MP in the 1970s but, dissatisfied with the Labour Government's policy on Scottish devolution and their socio-economic programme, had in 1976 formed the SLP. This influx of ex-SLP members served to strengthen the left of the party, to which these new members naturally gravitated.

In 1979, William Wolfe stood down as SNP leader, and in the resultant leadership election Gordon Wilson was elected leader with 530 votes to 79 Group member [[Stephen Maxwell]]'s 117 votes, and [[Willie MacRae]]'s 52 votes.

The 1980s offered little hope for the SNP with poor performances in both the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]] General Elections. Indeed, even the party leader, [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] lost his seat in 1987. The party took stock of these results and started to analyse its policy platform. Sillars began to grow in influence in the party and the SNP was firmly placing itself on the left of centre.

Sillars argued against the idea that the party should eschew left-right politics in favour of focussing solely on independence by stating the Scottish people had to be given reasons as to why independence would benefit their lives, and that this should involve a fully developed socio-economic programme. He argued against the idea that somehow the country could be guided in a "tartan trance" to independence, as if the Scottish people could ignore the realities of the economic system in which they found themselves. Sillars was also key in moving the party to adopting a position of ''Independence in Europe'' to alleviate the "separatist" tag that the SNP's unionist opponents attached to them. Previously, the SNP had been sceptical about Scotland's continued membership of the [[European Union|EEC]], but Sillars helped secure a firm commitment to an independent Scotland's membership.

There was a minor setback in 1987 when a few members on the left of the party broke away to establish a [[Scottish Socialist Party (1987-1990)|Scottish Socialist Party]] (not the same one that is in existence now) but in the long-run this small party did not establish itself and it folded without threatening to make a major electoral breakthrough.

As the 1980s wore on, the party managed to re-group and in 1988 the SNP managed to win the [[Glasgow Govan by-election, 1988|Govan seat in a by-election]] for the second time, with Sillars as their candidate. This was a huge upset, as the SNP overturned a Labour majority of around 19,000 and had not been expected to win. However, a hard fought campaign using the party's sizeable activist base won through. Sillars' oratorical capabilities and street campaigning methods also played a decisive role in the party's victory.

Sillars' victory provoked great alarm amongst the Labour Party hierarchy in Scotland, much as Ewing's had in the 1960s. Fearing that their strong Scottish electoral base was under threat, they helped establish the [[Scottish Constitutional Convention]] to set out a blueprint for devolution. Initially the SNP looked as though they would get involved and party leader Gordon Wilson and Sillars attended an initial meeting of the convention. However, the convention's unwillingness to contemplate independence as a constitutional option persuaded Sillars in particular against getting involved and the SNP did not take part.

==The 1990s==

===The first Salmond era===
In 1990 Wilson stood down as leader and was replaced by [[Alex Salmond]], who defeated [[Margaret Ewing]] for the post by 486 votes to 186. Salmond's victory surprised many as Ewing had the backing of most of the party leadership, including Sillars and the party secretary at the time, [[John Swinney]], although he would go on to become a key ally of Salmond. Ewing's prominent supporters made her many people's favourite to win the contest, but in the end Salmond was the convincing victor. He proved a capable leader with his witty and intelligent style of debate giving him a national prominence and boosting the SNP's profile.

In that same year the SNP presence at Westminster was boosted when Labour MP for [[Dunfermline West (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunfermline West]], [[Dick Douglas]] defected to the SNP, citing his dissatisfaction with the way Labour had handled the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Poll Tax]] issue as one reason. This boosted the SNP numbers at Westminster to five.

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 General Election]] had promised much for the SNP. It proved to be mixed in fortunes. The SNP held three seats they had won in 1987, but lost Govan. They also lost Dunfermline West, but this was not helped by the sitting MP Dick Douglas deciding to stand against Labour MP [[Donald Dewar]] in his Glasgow seat instead of defending the seat he had represented for years.

The SNP had failed to make headway in terms of winning seats. However, their campaign proved a success in terms of votes won, with the SNP vote going up by 50% from their 1987 performance. It proved too much to bear for Sillars though, and he quit active politics, famously describing the Scots as '90 minute patriots'. It also signaled the breakdown of the political relationship between Sillars and Salmond.

The intervening years between the 1992 and 1997 general elections were marked by some SNP electoral success. In the [[European Parliament election, 1994 (United Kingdom)|1994 elections]] for the [[European Parliament]] the party managed to secure over 30% of the popular vote and return two MEPs (Winnie Ewing and [[Allan MacCartney]]). The SNP also came very close to winning the [[Monklands East by-election, 1994|Monklands East by-election of that year]], caused by the death of the leader of the Labour Party, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. In 1995 they went one better, when the [[Perth and Kinross by-election, 1995|Perth and Kinross by-election]] was won by [[Roseanna Cunningham]] who later became the party's deputy leader.

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]] saw the SNP double their number of MPs from three to six.

===The Scottish Parliament===
The return of the Labour Party to power came along with a [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|referendum on Scottish devolution]], which resulted in the establishment of the [[Scottish Parliament]]. This gave the SNP an opportunity to firmly establish itself as a political force in Scotland, and it returned 35 MSPs in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 1999|first Scottish Parliament election]] in 1999. Later that year, the party returned two members to the European Parliament, narrowly missing out on sending a third.

The first term of the Scottish Parliament did not offer the SNP much comfort. Two MSPs quit the party, Margo MacDonald and [[Dorothy-Grace Elder]], citing the actions of some of their colleagues as reasons for their resignations. The SNP also performed poorly at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 UK general election]] with a reduced share of the vote and one fewer MP.

Despite optimism that the party would at least retain the same number of MSPs they gained in 1999, a downturn in electoral fortune at the [[Scottish Parliamentary Election, 2003|2003 Scottish Parliament Elections]] weakened them somewhat. They returned 27 elected members in the Scottish Parliament, though remained the second largest party. The only parties which increased their representation in that election were the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (SSP) and the [[Scottish Green Party]], both of which also support independence for Scotland.

Recent{{when|date=June 2016}} debate within the SNP has been marked by disagreements between the [[SNP Gradualist|gradualist wing]] of the party, which believes in taking powers from Westminster bit-by-bit, and the [[SNP Fundamentalist|fundamentalist wing]], which argue that a greater emphasis should be placed on the party's support for independence to enthuse their activists and core supporters.

==The 2000s==

===Swinney's loss of control===
{{see also|Scottish National Party leadership election, 2000|Scottish National Party leadership election, 2003}}
In 2000 [[John Swinney]] MSP was elected leader, defeating [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]] MSP by 547 votes to 268 in a hotly contested leadership election to replace Alex Salmond as National Convenor. Swinney's leadership quickly came under challenge. His subdued style of debating technique was often contrasted with that of his more charismatic predecessor.

Soon, Swinney's leadership was challenged by grassroots activist, [[Bill Wilson (Scottish politician)|Dr. Bill Wilson]], in the summer of 2003. Wilson was broadly critical of what he argued were the centralising tendencies of the Swinney leadership, as well as a drift to the centre ground of politics away from the SNP's traditional position of the left. At the party conference of that year, the election took place with Swinney receiving 577 votes and Wilson taking 111.

2004 did not get off to a good start for Swinney's leadership. On 1 January, a former parliamentary candidate and a party activist in the [[Shetland Islands]] Brian Nugent announced that he was forming his own pro-independence party, the "Scottish Party" (which eventually relaunched itself as the [[Free Scotland Party]]) in response to what he perceived to be an overly pro-[[European Union|EU]] stance by the SNP.

Soon afterwards, the party's National Executive Committee decided to suspend and then expel [[Campbell Martin]], an SNP MSP. Martin had backed Wilson's leadership challenge and had continued to be overtly critical of Swinney's leadership, resulting in disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3880887.stm|title=Nationalists throw out rebel MSP|date=10 July 2004|accessdate=1 June 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a slump in the vote and a decrease in the number of available seats from 7 to 6, the SNP was able to retain its two [[Members of the European Parliament]] at the [[European Parliament Election, 2004 (UK)|2004 European elections]]. Nonetheless, John Swinney announced his resignation on 22 June 2004. He said that he would remain as caretaker leader until a successor was elected.

===2004 leadership contest===
{{Main article|Scottish National Party leadership election, 2004}}
Shortly afterwards, two MSPs ([[Roseanna Cunningham]] and [[Nicola Sturgeon]]) and one former MSP ([[Michael Russell (politician)|Mike Russell]]) announced that they would be candidates in the election for the party leadership. [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]] MSP announced that he would not be a candidate, citing what he believed to be the hostility of senior party figures such as [[Fergus Ewing]] and [[Alex Salmond]] to the prospect of his becoming leader. In a surprise announcement on 15 July 2004, [[Alex Salmond]] announced that he would also be a candidate in the leadership race, despite having previously said "if asked, I'll decline, if nominated, I'll defer, and if elected, I'll resign". [[Nicola Sturgeon]] then withdrew from the contest and declared her support for Salmond and decided to stand for Deputy Leader.

This resulted in [[Kenny MacAskill]] pulling out of the race for deputy and declaring his support for Salmond and Sturgeon, leaving Sturgeon standing against [[Fergus Ewing]] and [[Christine Grahame]]. Shortly after Salmond and Sturgeon announced they were running on a joint ticket.

The campaign for leader was characterised by being a low-key affair. Salmond remained firm favourite to win back the leadership of the SNP. There remained greater doubt as to who would be the deputy leader with it being widely expected to be a much more close run affair than that for the post of leader.

There were some surprises during the course of the campaign. Alex Neil and [[Adam Ingram (SNP politician)|Adam Ingram]] both came out in support of Alex Salmond, although they supported Grahame for deputy rather than Sturgeon. This was unexpected as both men had previously been critics of Salmond in the past. It was particularly surprising in light of Salmond's earlier comments, before he had entered the race that he would have difficulties working with Neil should he be elected leader, although he later went on the record to say that he should not have publicly said this.

There was some degree of criticism of Salmond's position by other candidates, who felt that his decision to lead the SNP from being a member of the British Parliament at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] rather than from the [[Scottish Parliament]] was contrary to the party's aim of independence. Nonetheless on 3 September 2004, Salmond and Sturgeon were elected leader and deputy respectively. The result of the Leadership contest, in what was the first "One Member One Vote" election run by the SNP (as opposed to the delegate based elections of the past) was Salmond 4,952 (75.8%); Cunningham 953 (14.6%); and Russell 631 (9.7%). The result of the contest for Deputy Leader was Sturgeon 3,521 (53.9%); Ewing 1,605 (24.6%); and Grahame 1,410 (21.6%).

Since Salmond was an MP until 2010, Sturgeon led the party at the Scottish Parliament until Alex Salmond was elected as an MSP in 2007.

===United Kingdom general election, 2005===
{{main article|United Kingdom general election, 2005}}
The SNP had mixed fortunes in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|general election]] held on 5 May 2005. They managed to gain two seats ([[Angus MacNeil]] winning in [[Na h-Eileanan an Iar]] and [[Stewart Hosie]] in [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]]) from the notional four they held to bring their total to six Members of Parliament. MacNeil's victory received particular praise for the 9.2% swing from Labour that led to the victory, especially as it was the first SNP gain from Labour in a UK general election for 31 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/scotland/4519491.stm|title=SNP secures Western Isles victory|date=6 May 2005|accessdate=21 May 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was also disappointment in that the sitting MP [[Annabelle Ewing]] did not manage to win the new [[Ochil and South Perthshire]] constituency, finishing 688 votes behind the Labour candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/scotland/4520151.stm|title=SNP fails in bid for Ochil seat|date=6 May 2005|accessdate=21 May 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also disappointment in that the SNP's share of the Scottish vote fell to 17.7% and that they finished third behind the Liberal-Democrats; this was the first time this had ever happened. The SNP's share of the vote across the Scottish [[Central Belt]] was particularly low, with some candidates only just managing to achieve a high enough share of the vote in their constituency to retain their £500 deposit.

However, Alex Salmond was in buoyant mood in the aftermath of the campaign, describing the SNP's Westminster parliamentary group as ''"Scotland's Super Six"'' and also promising that the SNP would be far more competitive in the [[Scottish Parliamentary Election, 2007|2007 election]] for the Scottish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/scotland/4519323.stm|title=In Quotes: Election reaction|date=6 May 2005|accessdate=21 May 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Party of Government===
{{main article|Scottish Parliament general election, 2007}}
The Scottish National Party was victorious in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|2007 election]] to the Scottish Parliament, emerging as the largest party with 47 seats. It narrowly defeated the incumbent [[Scottish Labour Party]], which had 46 seats. The [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservatives]] won 17 seats, the [[Scottish Liberal Democrats|Lib Dems]] 16 seats, the [[Scottish Green Party|Greens]] 2 seats, and the [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] candidate [[Margo MacDonald]] was re-elected. On 16 May 2007, Alex Salmond was elected [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] by the Parliament and sworn in the next day at the [[Court of Session]] in Edinburgh. The SNP went on to win the [[Glasgow East by-election, 2008]] and the largest share of the Scottish popular vote in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (United Kingdom)|European Parliament election, 2009]].

==The 2010s==

The [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK general election]] proved disappointing for the SNP, as the party only retained their six seats without making any gains, although they did overtake the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] to become the second-largest party on the popular vote share.

===Landslide Victory===
{{main article|Scottish Parliament general election, 2011}}
The [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011]], however, delivered the first majority government of the devolved Scottish Parliament as the SNP won 69 seats, considered a remarkable feat as the [[Additional Member System]] used to elect MSPs was originally implemented to prevent single-party governments, as well as to produce proportional results. Following the result, the leaders of all the main opposition parties resigned their positions. Later, the SNP confirmed its intent to hold [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|a referendum on Scottish independence]].

===Independence Referendum Campaign===
{{main article|Scottish independence referendum, 2014}}
In October 2012, the SNP voted at its party conference to change their stance on [[Nato]], supporting continued membership for an independent Scotland. This was widely seen as the resolution of the long-standing [[Nato debate in the Scottish National Party|Nato debate within the party]]. In response, two MSPs - [[John Finnie]] and [[Jean Urquhart]] - resigned from the party and became Independent MSPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/msps-resign-snp-nato-stance|title=Two MSPs resign from SNP over party's Nato stance|date=23 October 2012|accessdate=15 May 2013|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Severin|last=Carrell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another MSP, [[John Wilson (Scottish politician)|John Wilson]], followed after the independence referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29335767|title=SNP MSP John Wilson quits party over Nato row|date=23 September 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015|publisher=''BBC News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, some policies the SNP would pursue in an independent Scotland were detailed in ''[[Scotland's Future]]'', the Scottish Government's 670-page [[white paper]] on the case for Scottish independence and the means through which Scotland would become an independent country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25088251|title=Scottish independence: Referendum White Paper unveiled|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=27 November 2013|publisher=''[[BBC News]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had previously been claimed by the SNP that the White Paper would be a "game changer" and support for independence did rise after the publication of the document.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/should-scotland-be-an-independent-country-1#line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404202842/http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/should-scotland-be-an-independent-country-1 |date=4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish independence referendum|referendum]] was held on Thursday 18 September 2014. The [[Yes Scotland|Yes Campaign]] was defeated, with 44.7% of voters voting "Yes" and 55.3% voting "No" in response to the question "Should Scotland be an independent country?".

===Sturgeon Era===

Following the defeat of the [[Yes Scotland|Yes Campaign]], on the morning of the 19 September, [[Alex Salmond]] announced he intended to step down as Leader of the Scottish National Party and [[First Minister of Scotland]] at the SNP's Autumn Conference.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resigns-first-minister-for-scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 14 November 2014, [[Nicola Sturgeon]] was elected as Leader of the Scottish National Party unopposed, with [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] MP [[Stewart Hosie]] elected as Depute Leader. On 20 November 2014, Sturgeon was formally sworn in as [[First Minister of Scotland]], becoming the first female to hold the position. She embarked on a tour of [[Scotland]], speaking to 12,000 people at the [[Hydro Arena]] in [[Glasgow]] on 22 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30157986 | work=BBC News | title='Democracy rocks' for Nicola Sturgeon at Glasgow Hydro | date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SNP's party membership increased dramatically post referendum, from around 25,000 members on the day of the referendum to around 92,000 as of 22 November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2014/nov/snp-membership-now-exceeds-extraordinary-90000 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225120118/http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2014/nov/snp-membership-now-exceeds-extraordinary-90000 |archivedate=25 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|United Kingdom general election, 2017}}

The SNP underperformed against polling expectations, losing 21 seats to bring their Westminster MPs down to 35. In what was largely attributed to their stance on holding a [[proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second Scottish independence referendum]] and saw a significant swing to the Unionist parties, with seats being gained by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and a significant reduction in their majorities in the seats they did manage to retain. High-profile losses included: SNP House of Commons leader [[Angus Robertson]] in [[Moray (UK Parliament constituency)|Moray]] and former SNP leader and [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Alex Salmond]] in [[Gordon (UK Parliament constituency)|Gordon]]; both of whom lost their seats to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].

'''International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations''' (in [[German language|German]]: ''Internationales Büro Revolutionärer Jugendorganisationen'', in French: ''Bureau International des Organisations Révolutionnaires des Jeunes'') was an international organization of socialist youth, formed in 1934. It functioned as the youth wing of the [[London Bureau]].

The founding congress was held in the [[Netherlands]], hosted by the [[Independent Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Independent Socialist Party]] (OSP). However the congress was broken up by the Dutch police. Foreign delegates were deported, amongst them German delegates who were deported back to Germany. The congress was then re-convened in [[Lille]]. The congress elected a Bureau (with one representative of each participating organization) and a Secretariat. The Secretariat had three members, one from the [[SAPD]] ([[Willy Brandt]]), one from the [[International Left Opposition]] ([[Heinz Epe]]) and one from the [[Socialist Party (Sweden, 1929)|Socialist Party]] of Sweden.

The IBRYO secretariat was headquartered in [[Scandinavia]]. The Bureau secretariat met in [[Malmö]] and [[Stockholm]]. Epe was headquartered in [[Oslo]], Norway.

IBRYO published ''Internationales Jugend-Bulletin''.

In 1935 the [[Trotskyist]]s were expelled from the Bureau, as they had collectively embarked on [[entryism]] into the major labour parties (which was contrary to the ambitions of IBRYO and the London Bureau to build a new international).

The '''International Relations and Security Network''' ('''ISN''') was part of the [[Center for Security Studies (CSS)]] at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]], which is located in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Security Studies (CSS), [http://www.css.ethz.ch/about/index_EN About us]&lt;/ref&gt; It was an online information service that provided a range of [[open access]] products and resources that concentrated on [[international relations]] (IR) and [[security studies]].&lt;ref&gt;CSIS Pacific Forum, [http://csis.org/programs/pacific-forum-csis/partners Partners]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the ISN ceased to be a stand-alone project and was fully integrated into its parent organization as CSS Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services.html|title=Resources|website=www.css.ethz.ch|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The ISN was established in 1994 as a means of improving cooperation between security policy institutes and to make research programs, projects and papers widely available on the internet. It was initially sponsored by the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports]], the [[Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]], the [[German Institute for International and Security Affairs]], the [[United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research]] and the [[Center for Security Studies]].

Its mission developed to promote dialogue and cooperation in the fields of international relations and security studies, primarily by creating, distributing and processing open access information on these issues. The ISN was also a co-organizer of the Swiss-sponsored [[International Security Forum]] (ISF), which is a large conference held every two years in [[Geneva]] and [[Zurich]] on a rotating basis.&lt;ref&gt;International Security Forum (ISF) 2013, [http://www.isf.ethz.ch/isf/About-the-ISF/Conference-Partners Conference Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220606/http://www.isf.ethz.ch/isf/About-the-ISF/Conference-Partners |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The ISN’s web-based, information-providing activities and services were divided into three main categories.

* '''[[Digital Library]]''' – The ISN’s Digital Library began as a repository of declassified [[Cold War]] documents and conference proceedings relevant to PfP countries.  Prior to the end of the project, the library contained over 70,000 downloadable publications including journal articles, books, working papers and government reports.&lt;ref&gt;International Relations and Security Network (ISN), [http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications  Digital Library - Publications]&lt;/ref&gt; The Digital Library also included an archive of web articles, blog posts, podcasts and videos as well as a directory of international organizations, NGOs, research institutes and other organizations  active in the field of international relations and security.
* '''Editorial Products''' – In cooperation with its partner network, the ISN published daily expert analyses, commentaries and blog posts as well as regular multimedia features on current IR- and security-related issues. It also provided Dossiers on a range of topics relevant to the international relations and security community.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Security Studies (CSS), [http://www.css.ethz.ch/about/PDFs/annual_reports/CSS-annual-report-2013.pdf Annual Report 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192320/http://www.css.ethz.ch/about/PDFs/annual_reports/CSS-annual-report-2013.pdf |date=2014-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Communities and Partners''' – The ISN provided an online knowledge network of 249 partner institutions and affiliates, consisting of [[Intergovernmental organization|international organizations]] (IOs), [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), state ministries, [[think tanks]], universities and research institutes.&lt;ref&gt;International Relations and Security Network (ISN), [http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Communities-and-Partners/Partner-Network Partner Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iron Wolf''' (''Geležinis Vilkas'', also known as Iron Wolf Association) was a Lithuanian paramilitary organization active in 1927–1934. Initially established as an athletic society (founded by officer Algirdas Sliesoraitis, supported by Catholic chaplain V. Mironas), it recruited its members mainly from army officers (overall numbers were minuscule). Its original ''raison d'être'' was perceived as a fight against internal destabilization in light of political crisis, civil unrest and yet another demonstrative threat of military intervention, made by the Polish government. With the exception of glorification of youth and struggle, it featured rather few criteria of fascist ideology.&lt;ref name="Gtoz"&gt;Alan Oliver Goetz, ''The Iron Wolf: Lithuanian Fascism (1927-1941)''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization gradually radicalized and became almost completely dependent on a personal will of [[Augustinas Voldemaras]], who used it to target his political opponents.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism: 1914-1945'', London: Routledge, 2001, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; After Voldemaras's Cabinet resignation, the movement was banned in 1930, although it continued as an underground group, ad became even more radical. In 1934, its members attempted a failed ''[[coup d'état]]'' against President [[Antanas Smetona]]. Voldemaras was arrested, released in 1938 and soon emigrated. Former members of the organization reorganized later in the 1930s.

Leading Voldemarists fled to [[Nazi Germany]] after the [[Soviet occupation of Lithuania]] in 1941.  They joined the [[Lithuanian Activist Front]] led by [[Kazys Škirpa]], but in the spring of 1941 betrayed him to work directly with the German [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD). After the Nazi Germany's invasion of the [[Soviet Union]], they led a failed putsch against the [[Provisional Government of Lithuania]]. They led the [[Lithuanian Nationalist Union]], which collaborated with the Nazi occupation and which was active in the [[Holocaust in Lithuania]]. 

The name of the organization comes from the story of [[Gediminas]]'s dream, first recorded in ''The Broad Code of Lithuanian Chronicles'' from the 16th century. During the period of 1928–1929, Iron Wolf published its periodical ''Tautos kelias'' twice a month.

IDS was founded on the 14 February 1990 by the writer [[Ivan Pauletta]]. IDS embraces principles of respect for human rights and freedoms, regionalism and historical characteristics of [[Istria]], protection of private property and anti-fascism. Party advocates greater regional autonomy, particularly in Istria, decentralization of Croatia and the establishment of a transnational and cross-border euro-region encompassing the whole of Istria. The party president is currently [[Boris Miletić]], [[Mayor]] of [[Pula]] and one of 3 IDS's representatives in the [[Croatian Parliament]]. IDS held  the [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (Croatia)| Ministry of European Integration]] between 2000 and 2001 in the [[Cabinet of Ivica Račan I|Cabinet of Ivica Račan]] and [[Ministry of Tourism (Croatia)|Ministry of Tourism]] between 2011 and 2016 in the [[Cabinet of Zoran Milanović]].

In addition, out of 10 towns in Istria county, IDS rules over 9.

IDS is member of the [[Liberal International]] and [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]].

==Symbols==

The three rams on the party coat of arms represent a historical symbol of the region, which is also represented by the ram in the fourth of the five parts of the crown resting atop the [[Croatian coat of arms]] (25-field white and red chequerboard) on the Croatian flag.

==History==
The party was founded in 1990 by [[Ivan Pauletta]], Elio Martinčić and Mario Sandrić, on the eve of the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|first multi-party elections]] in Croatia after [[communism]]. The party decided not to participate, thus allowing the post-communist [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia]] (SDP) to sweep the region's votes.

The party was led by [[Ivan Jakovčić]] between 1991 and 2014.

IDS instead made its electoral debut in the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1992|1992 elections]] and used the collapse of the SDP to take all three Istrian constituencies.

This result turned Istria into an area of significant concern for Croatian President [[Franjo Tuđman]] and his [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), which had dominated every other region in Croatia. For the [[Croatian Chamber of Counties election, 1993|first elections for Croatian Chamber of Counties]], which also coincided with the first election for newly formed [[Istria County]], state-controlled media launched an unprecedented media blitz directed almost exclusively at Istria. This effort spectacularly backfired as Istrian voters gave almost three quarters of their votes to IDS. After that no party challenged IDS supremacy in Istria, at least not directly.

The main policy of the IDS is intercession of cultural and economical identity of Istria and equal status for [[Italian Language|Italian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] in Istria. This was in opposition to Tuđman and his hard-line nationalism. Other Croatian political parties were more pragmatic, and IDS cooperated with them in the Croatian Parliament and during elections. In Istria, however, IDS is bitterly opposed by local branches of SDP, as well as their former member and first Istrian prefect [[Luciano Delbianco]] who had defected and formed a new party called [[Istrian Democratic Forum]].

IDS was briefly part of the national government following 2000 [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|parliamentary]] and [[Croatian presidential election, 2000|presidential]] elections. One year later, IDS, dissatisfied with the way [[Ivica Račan]] and his coalition partners treated Istria, left the government, although they continued to support it in Parliament.

In 2006, IDS joined the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]] (ALDE) Party.

From 2010-2015 IDS was a member of the [[Kukuriku coalition]].
Its member [[Darko Lorencin]] served as the minister of tourism in the Croatian government; he is a cousin of [[Beatrice Lorenzin]]: they are of a same Italian-Croat family.

In the [[Croatian Parliament]], [[Damir Kajin]] most frequently acted as the party's spokesperson, and he headed the party list in the 2007 elections where the party gained 3 representatives. Kajin was however removed from the party's membership on 3 January 2013 after forming his own coalition for the 2013 local elections in Istria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Istra/Statut-ga-nije-volio-Damir-Kajin-veceras-izbrisan-iz-clanstva-IDS-a PREKRŠIO STRANAČKA PRAVILA Statut ga nije volio: Damir Kajin večeras izbrisan iz članstva IDS-a] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106020528/http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Istra/Statut-ga-nije-volio-Damir-Kajin-veceras-izbrisan-iz-clanstva-IDS-a |date=2013-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduced the IDS from three to two representatives in the [[Croatian Sabor]], and forced the party's parliamentary club to dissolve due to insufficient membership.

'''John Call Cook, PhD''' (April 7, 1918 – October 12, 2012) was an American [[geophysicist]] who played a crucial role in establishing the field of [[ground-penetrating radar]] and is generally regarded as contributing the fundamental research to develop the field.&lt;ref name=amws&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.cengage.com/servlet/BrowseSeriesServlet?region=9&amp;imprint=000&amp;cf=es&amp;titleCode=AMWSE&amp;edition=|title=American Men and Women of Science|publisher=Gale Cengage Learning|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112230130/http://www.gale.cengage.com/servlet/BrowseSeriesServlet?region=9&amp;imprint=000&amp;cf=es&amp;titleCode=AMWSE&amp;edition=|archivedate=January 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook is also known for demonstrating that aerial surveys can map surface radioactivity to enable much more efficient prospecting for [[uranium ore]],&lt;ref name=amws/&gt; for inventing electrostatic detection of hazardous ice crevasses, and for developing other novel techniques in remote sensing.

During most of his professional career, Cook specialized in the techniques of [[remote sensing]] and the detection of underground objects.

== Early years ==

John Call Cook was born on April 7, 1918 in [[Afton, Wyoming]], to Carl and Ella Cook.&lt;ref name=Carl&amp;EllaCook&gt;{{cite book | last = Cook | first = Carl &amp; Ella | title = The Life Story of Carl and Ella Cook | date = 1981 | url = http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Life_Story_of_Carl_and_Ella_Cook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carl made his living as an attorney and farmer, and was himself the son of Phineas Wolcott Cook&lt;ref name=PhineasWolcottCook&gt;{{cite book | last = Cook | first = Phineas Wolcott Cook | title = The Life and History of Phineas Wolcott Cook | date = July 24, 1900 | url = http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Life_and_History_of_Phineas_Wolcott_Cook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number 4 wife, Johanna.

During his teens, John constructed various devices including a spark-gap device, a batteryless [[crystal radio]], a six-inch telescope, and an underwater 'diving helmet' constructed of a cookie can with plastic sheet bolted and gasketed for vision, powered by a garden hose and three tire pumps ganged together.&lt;ref name=EveningHerald&gt;{{cite news |last=Paulson |first=J. R. |date=Sep 13, 1935 |title=Ingenious Provo Youth Builds Own Telescope |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/36339543/ |newspaper=Provo (Utah) Evening Herald, pp3 |location=Provo, UT |accessdate=Jan 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University==

=== Undergraduate ===

Cook initially studied at [[Brigham Young University]] then enrolled with the [[University of Utah]] to study [[Physics]]. In the Spring of 1941 Cook began work as lab assistant at the university, and graduated that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ulink.utah.edu/s/1077/index.aspx?sid=1077&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=365|title=ULink - Chapters and Contacts|publisher=University of Utah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The war years===

As a physics major during the war, Cook was recruited to work at the [[Radiation Laboratory|Radiation Lab at MIT]] where he was assigned to work in the "Experimental Systems Group - 44" under Dr. James L. Lawson in the Roof [[Radiation Laboratory|Laboratory]].&lt;ref name=5atradlab&gt;{{cite book|title=Five years at the Radiation Laboratory|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |date=1946 |oclc=3506325 |location=Cambridge |url=https://archive.org/details/fiveyearsatradia00mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group worked on advanced problems of radar systems, such as signal discernibility, anti-jamming, short pulses, and receiver design.&lt;ref name=5atradlab/&gt; For some time afterward this group's experimental systems led the field in performance—its members were continually breaking new ground and extending the range of radar's capabilities.&lt;ref name=5atradlab/&gt;

They used an [[S-band]] (10&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength) and an [[X-band]] (3&amp;nbsp;cm) set, each with several kinds of display, and later received a [[K band (IEEE)|K-band]] set (1&amp;nbsp;cm) which could resolve the structure of a nearby [[gasholder]].&lt;ref name=5atradlab/&gt; These sets had around 300 vacuum tubes each, and 10 to 20 adjustment knobs each, and many interconnecting cables.  Nearly every day a vacuum tube would fail, and they would have to trace and troubleshoot.&lt;ref name=5atradlab/&gt;

They often tracked a [[B-17 bomber]] sent from [[Hanscom Air Force Base|Bedford Airfield]] for their use, trying variations in frequency and polarization, the use of [[chaff]] and [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming countermeasures]], and trying to evaluate the use of propeller modulation signal amplitude to identify friendly versus hostile.&lt;ref name=5atradlab/&gt;

==== M.I.T Rocket Research Society ====

Cook was elected president of the Rocket Research Society, a special-interest club, at the Radiation Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/8.10419|title=MIT Rocket Research Society,. Massachusetts Institute of Technology,. Cambridge 39, Mass. - American Rocket Society News", Astronautics, Vol. 14, No. 60 (1944), pp. 12-13.doi: 10.2514/8.10419|date=Dec 1944|publisher=Astronautics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Rocket Society]] in New York had shut down for the duration of the war, but the M.I.T group continued development of [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-fueled rockets]].  Cook built a portable test stand from a wooden box, with a thrust gauge, tanks for fuel and oxidizer, valves with long control rods, and electric ignition.  John, Bob Smith, and others built rocket motors of steel, aluminum, ceramic, silver from coins, etc., using the lathes and other facilities of the M.I.T Student Model Shop, where some of the members maintained the precarious good will of the man in charge.

Some of their number managed to obtain [[liquid oxygen]] from the nearby [[Arthur D. Little#History|Arthur D. Little company]], which was developing a portable military "lox" generator and was dumping excess product fuming and freezing everything, into the gutter.  The club hauled it to their test site in 5-gallon steel cans insulated with fiber mat.  This gave their most successful test—the rocket motor roared with a ten-foot plume of flame filled with standing shock waves, with the thrust gauge off-scale for ten seconds or more.  But the aluminum motor burned out its throat and set the test stand on fire, which they put out with a [[Fire extinguisher#History|Pyrene hand fire extinguisher]].  However the [[carbon tetrachloride]] produced [[phosgene]] and [[chlorine]] gasses (they deduced), which corroded all the metal.

They still had gallons of liquid oxygen left, and so decided to make an explosion.  The blast shot a board 50 feet in the air end-over-end, and embedded gravel in the chest of the fuse-lighter, even with Cook's efforts at safety. This episode was exaggerated in MIT's humor magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/voodoo/www/archive/|title=The Voo Doo Archive Project|publisher=voodoo [at] mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Cook was portrayed as the nonchalant "Lon Crook".

In spring 1945 they received news of the German [[V-2]] rocket-propelled ballistic missiles striking Britain.  The [[Verein für Raumschiffahrt|German Rocket Society]], with their government's support, had continued the work of American [[Robert Goddard]] and were far ahead of the U.S.  However, their large, successful rockets had been applied at once to military purposes.  Cook was disgusted with this and so lost interest in rockets until [[NASA]] was formed. When it also developed that he would soon be leaving Cambridge, he resigned as president of the MIT Rocket Research Society and turned it over to [[Robert Kraichnan]], who would later become prominent in [[General relativity|relativity]].

=== Master of Science ===

In the Fall of 1945 Cook applied for and received a graduate assistantship at [[Penn State]] and began work on a master's degree.  During his second year there he was appointed to teach Prof. Weber's junior year Thermal Laboratory course.  Cook read extensively in the Physics Library on gravitational topics, developed a thesis plan, and performed a program of experiments using an [[Eötvös torsion balance]] (an extremely sensitive gravity-sensing instrument) owned by the Geophysics Department in the Mineral Industries building.  [https://www.amazon.com/Geologic-Well-Analysis-Sylvain-Pirson/dp/0872019020 Prof. Sylvain Pirson] there was pleased with the modifications Cook had made to improve the sensitivity of the balance, and with his administration of the course.  However Prof. Duncan, the department head, advised Cook that as he'd had serious difficulty with some important mathematical physics courses, it was recommended that he leave with the MS and not come back.

Graduated in 1947 at age 29.&lt;ref name=pennstate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradsch.psu.edu/|title=The Graduate School at Penn State|publisher= Penn State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Somewhat in shock from the experiences of his Master's, Cook drove home.  He met L.V.S. Roos of [[Texaco]], who headed a crew doing [[seismic prospecting]] for oil in the Utah area, and was hired on as Assistant Recorder at $300/month.  Early each morning their crew of 8 would drive out with the recording truck, a drill-hole rig, and a water tanker to various sites marked by a survey crew.  The drill crew made a 3" hole up to 150' deep and emplaced a dynamite charge.  They laid out numerous cables 1,000' around the radius of the recorder truck and attached geophones connected at intervals.  Then a preliminary charge would be set off to 'spring' the hole, and then the main shot was made, requiring many switches to be thrown in a special order.  This all required concentration and care as, once blown the hole could not be used anymore, and Cook was soon promoted for getting good data.  Having a master's degree, Cook was treated as someone special by visiting Texaco officials and Mr. Roos, and it was suggested that he could be a Crew Chief or could be asked to join the laboratory staff in Houston.  These successes and being with family, had restored Cook's confidence.

=== PhD ===

In late Fall, 1947 Cook received a telegram from Prof. Pirson at Penn State offering him a job in the Geophysics Department as a Research Assistant for $170/mo, to work on a PhD in Geophysics.  Tuition would be only a nominal fee, and colder weather meant working on the field crew would be unpleasant, so Cook immediately accepted the opportunity. On arrival at Penn State he moved back into the Graduate Club and was accepted into the PhD program.  Cook was made responsible for the earthquake seismograph station so learned how to run it, read the records, and send reports to Washington.  At Prof. Pirson's request he built their first [[vertical-component seismometer]] and arranged for visible-ink recording of its output upstairs in their offices, so they no longer had to develop photographic records to know when an earthquake was happening anywhere on Earth.

In the Winter of 1949 Cook attempted to complete an experiment begun during his Master's work: to detect a [[tangential gravitational field]] purportedly produced around a rotating body (according to certain published theories).  He had not found it with the small centrifuge in the Mineral Processing lab, so arranged to work with the massive turbine rotors at the [[Westinghouse Plant Apparatus Division]], Atomic Power Plant Equipment, east of Pittsburgh, Pa.  He drove to the plant several times with the Eötvös torsion balance in the back, and set it up close to one of the newly-made rotors while it was being balanced at 3,600rpm on the giant factory floor.  The balance needed to settle for an hour, and Cook needed one reading with the rotor stationary, then another with it turning at full speed;  however random vibrations, the starting and stopping for tuning, and heating and cooling to simulate operating conditions made stable readings difficult.  Westinghouse engineers showed Cook blueprints of the building, which had a floor of great cast-iron plates 6" thick, resting on brick piers on bedrock.  It could hardly be more sturdy, yet still vibrated from the machinery.  Cook tried damping spurious modes by filling the delicate instrument with alcohol, but this induced more instabilities, possibly from thermal currents.  During his final attempt at Westinghouse Cook was told that a famous engineer in the research lab wanted to see him, [[Joseph Slepian]], who asked about the theoretical basis of a tangential gravitational field, and proceeded to cast doubt as it's not an effect predicted by [[General Relativity|Einstein's General Relativity]].  Cook could not debate the matter and so gave up the pursuit.

Also during that Winter and at Pirson's request, Cook built a model of an oil well with an electric logging system.  This yielded data and curves which Prof. Pirson felt should be published, so Cook wrote ''Laboratory Tests of Electrolog Resistivity Interpretation'', which was published in [[The Producers Monthly]].  On the strength of that research Pirson nominated Cook for membership in [[Sigma Xi]], the national research honorary, in which Cook remained a lifelong member.

Pirson then arranged for Cook to take over a research project for the [[Penn Grade Crude Association]] (a small group of oil firms in northwest Pennsylvania) with a salary of $300/mo and promotion to Research Associate.  Another Research Associate, Bacon, and Cook were left with teaching all of the Geophysics courses;  Bacon taught most, while Cook taught General Geochemistry for Fall-Winter, 1948-9 and worked in research.  At the end of the school year, Pirson left the university for a better paying job with an oil company in Tulsa, OK.  All in the department were sorry to see this professor go.

During the Winter-Spring of 1948-9 Cook did field work in the oilfields around Bradford in northwestern Pennsylvania as part of the Penn Grade research.  These fields are famous for producing high-grade petroleum which is refined into Quaker State, Pennzoil and other superior brands.  Cook saw the actual drilling and logging processes, although most wells were 30–50 years old with decrepit and rusty pumping equipment.  A central engine running on natural gas (from the wells) in a shack, with steel rods radiating out to wells all around (as much as 500' away), rocking back and forth on the ground or on stands.  Here, Cook conceived an improvement in electric logging technique: a thin-sheet current path controlled by [['shielding-current' electrodes]], analogous to the [[Kelvin potential shields]] he had learned about at the [[University of Utah]].  He built a model, which did indeed greatly improve the vertical resolution of the [[resistivity logging]].  Cook considered getting a patent, but soon learned that a similar system had been developed by another sole inventor and [[Schlumberger#History|Schlumberger Well Surveying Corp]], who were involved in patent litigation with one another.

==== Thesis ====
Prospecting for uranium had just become popular and, because the government had guaranteed to buy
any uranium found, at an attractive price. Vast areas of the U.S. had never been explored for uranium, and a few lucky individuals became rich by finding ores with simply a [[geiger counter]]. Cook saw aerial prospecting as a new field of [[Geophysics]], which needed analysis, so this became his thesis topic. How fast must the detector operate? How high and how fast could one fly? How small could a deposit of ore be and still be detected? How badly would the geophysical anomaly be smeared and weakened by overburden and by the air? How serious is the interference from cosmic rays and background radioactivity? Cook was soon able to answer most of these questions with elaborate calculations based on library studies. However it was necessary to check and verify the calculations by model and full-scale experiments, insofar as this was possible.

The Geophysics department had just bought a small, portable [[geiger counter]], which did respond well to the gamma rays coming from rock samples Cook had gathered from the [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania#History|Mauch Chunk]] [[camotite]] outcrop. One could get crude quantitative data by counting the audible "clicks" it produced over a minute's time. In this way, a gamma-ray "profile" of an ore stockpile at a uranium refinery at [[Rifle, Colorado]] was obtained during Cook's trip West in the summer of 1950. The ore was clearly detectable at a distance of a quarter-mile. However, it was known that equipment of much greater sensitivity would be needed for a practical airborne survey. In fact, [[scintillation detectors]] having both a much larger cross-
section and much higher detection efficiency were already in airborne use in Canada and by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]], although many of the details were secret.

Cook attempted to cast a large [[sodium iodide]] crystal in a glass baking dish, using one of the Department ovens, with poor results. (it's an art)  With limited funds, he secured a large [[geiger-mueller tube]] 18 inches long, one inch in diameter, which was adequate for his thesis experiments.He developed the needed accessory circuits (high-voltage source and amplifiers, all battery-powered, a borrowed mechanical pulse counter, and 400&amp;nbsp;ft of lightweight, high-voltage twin cable on a portable reel). With this equipment Cook found the effect of height on the [[gamma ray]] field from the soil (using flagpoles). He also ran fairly accurate (1.5%) radiation profiles at various heights over several gamma-ray sources: boxes of ore, the [[Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania#History|Mauch Chunk]] [[Uranium ore|uranium deposit]], and 0.1 gram of pure [[radium]] borrowed from a hospital! Heights up to 300&amp;nbsp;ft. were achieved using 6-foot hydrogen-filled balloons from the Meteorology department to lift the detector, preamplifier and cable. This work occupied much of the Winter and Spring of 1950-51. Cook wrote a careful thesis of over 100 pages, with 29 figures, which wife Vi typed in 3 copies, and was approved by the Committee.

Cook continued teaching, including developing a new course in [[Well logging|Oil Well Logging]] methods ([[electric resistivity]], [[self-potential]], [[gamma-ray]], [[neutron]], [[sonic velocity]], etc.), which he taught to about 20 Geophysics seniors. He also tried to invent a [[gravity gradiometer]] for [[rock-density logging]], however his first model using mercury and oil columns in glass tubes, showed the obvious fact that any ROTATION is equivalent to a [[gravity gradient]], and a stabilized mounting is required. So Cook had to give up on this for an indefinite time.

In 1951 Cook was the first PhD in [[Geophysics]] to graduate from [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]].&lt;ref name=pennstate/&gt;  By this time he had produced three articles which challenged existing thinking of the time, "''Laboratory Tests of Electrolog Resistivity Interpretation''", "''Characteristics of Reservoir Models by Resistivity Logging''", and "''Can Gravity Be Abolished?''".  His doctoral dissertation, "''An Analysis of Airborne Surveying for Surface Radioactivity''", was also published in the primary journal for the field, [http://geophysics.geoscienceworld.org/ Geophysics].

== Professional life ==

=== Finding employment ===
His education nearly complete, Cook wrote letters offering his services to several oil companies and other labs (the natural employers of geophysicists) located in the subtropical Southwest, as wife Vi needed warmer climate. He received five invitations to interviews in the Spring of 1951.

In Tulsa at the [[Amoco|Stanolind Oil Co.]] where Dr. Pirson worked, Cook got on well with Dr. Dan Silverman (Chief Geophysicist), but inexplicably never got a formal offer from them. In Dallas the [[Magnolia Petroleum Co.]] gave him a thorough day-long visit with several lab heads, and later made the largest offer of $525/month.  In Houston, the [[Texaco]] lab did a superficial interview and offered $450/month. At the impressive [[Shell Oil Co.]] lab near Houston, the interviewer posed a question that required thorough familiarity with the use of the [[binomial theorem]], which Cook could not answer at that time (the interviewer was educated in Europe), so they made no offer. In San Antonio, Bill Mussen, head of Geophysics at the [[Southwest Research Institute]] (whose start-up literature Cook had seen at Penn State), showed a new organization and a fascinating project that needed him: evaluating new oil-finding inventions. They drove him to the hotel, and offered $500/month. Cook had reservations about working for Bill Mussen ("a dapper fellow, he seemed stuffy, on a different wavelength somehow") but accepted the job.

=== Southwest Research Institute ===
Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) was founded by [[Tom Slick]], one of the heirs of a millionaire oil wildcatter, on a big ranch west of San Antonio. Tom was an idealistic young man, hoping to provide a permanent asset to the region in return for what it had given to his father. He gave the land, with a
few buildings, and about a million dollars for initial operations. SwRI was and is a non-profit organization like a university, but supports itself with research contracts from the government and industry.

==== The Bulletin ====
Cook's initial assignment was to take over a Bulletin service, titled "''New and Unorthodox Methods of Petroleum Exploration''".&lt;ref name=unorth&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook |first=John C. |date=1952 |title=New and Unorthodox Methods of Petroleum Exploration |url= |location= |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |page= |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This service was supported by six oil companies who received the periodic Bulletins, considered confidential and proprietary. It had been expected initially that "new" oil-finding methods would be referred to the Bulletin for study by client oil companies, but this happened rarely or never.  So Cook sought out the unconventional techniques by following up leads from research and ads in oil and gas trade journals. He arranged to meet with proponents to see their ideas and equipment in action, traveling the Western states, and attended geophysical and oil trade conventions and exhibits. Cook became president of the San Antonio Geophysical Society for a year, and worked on the national convention of his main professional society, the [[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] (SEG).  Cook published several papers in the SEG joumal, "''Geophysics''", which proved a very good way to publish his findings relating to exploration.

Some local lawyers asked SwRI for a physicist to be an 'expert witness' on an auto accident case, and Cook was appointed. He was able to discredit an opposing 'expert' because he'd misread some trigonometric tables. Cook's lawyers won, and gave him $500 for this day in court. He was asked to help in other cases, but Bill Mussen objected to this, so Cook withdrew.

To maintain his 'second profession' of teaching, Cook taught math&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cook | first = John | title = Some Courses Taught by John C. Cook at San Antonio College | date = Sep 1953 | url = https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Courses_Taught_by_John_C._Cook_at_San_Antonio_College.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in night school at the [[San Antonio College]] for two years, including [[trig]], [[analytical geometry]] and [[calculus]]. The College wanted him to continue teaching there, but he felt it was at the cost of his research.

In the three years Cook operated the Bulletin service he improved the composing and printing, and he'd done major analyses of several unconventional techniques, which appeared to have some scientific basis or were being seriously considered by several oil companies.  These included [[Surface Geochemistry]], [[Gamma-ray Profiling]], [[Radoil]] (profiles of the strength of radio waves), and [[Elfiex]] (which generated and measured sub-audio electric waves in the ground). In each of these cases, Cook not only observed field surveys by the proponents (in some cases for months), but studied all pertinent published theory and results, and sometimes did extensive model and field experiments of his own. The major conclusion Cook reached was that the ground is very difficult to 'see through' by any physical process provided by nature, and that the conventional seismic reflection method was by far the best at that time.

Cook found numerous variations of technique practiced by various proponents of radio-wave profiling; each man or group believed sincerely that his variation HAD produced anomalies or signals clearly correlated with deposits of oil.  Such correlation was, to Cook, very hard to demonstrate. He found that in previous years, similar variations had been demonstrated in [[surface geochemistry]] and in [[Uses of radioactivity in oil and gas wells|radioactivity profiling]], also with ambiguous results. He made a statistical study of the probability of finding oil, and included it in one Bulletin; it turned out that ANY method, even flipping a coin, will generally be right if it predicts "No Oil Here"... if you spend a fortune drilling, it will be a "dry hole". Then there were the practitioners of sympathetic magic, who naturally were attracted to petroleum prospecting by the hope of fantastic wealth. Most had no technical
education and fell under immediate suspicion through their misuse of technical terms; some written claims were laughable.  One man had attached a razor blade to a coat-hangar dowsing rod "to cut the lines of force". Some claimed to have special, secret powers. These Cook gave a full and sympathetic hearing, and a careful performance test in the field; he found none who could perform as claimed. One
gentleman, who styled himself "Doctor", had a crude diploma from a well-known mail-order diploma mill. Cook reported on them one and all, with his frank evaluation in the Bulletin, and sent each one a copy of his report on their method. This dissuaded no one; some continued to try to 'convert' him for years.

After three years, Bill Mussen and Cook agreed that they had not found anything promising, nor were likely to, so ended the Bulletin service. Cook published a full account in "''Geophysics''" and issued three bound volumes to clients, containing all the issues.

As the Bulletin service was ending Mussen sold a contract to the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] (Fort Belvoir, Va.) to develop new methods of detecting buried, non-metallic land mines. Cook was in charge of this work for the next three years. It was classified Confidential, as a military job, and Cook's Secret clearance from the RadLab was again useful. Cook developed a theory and experiment for an electric-current technique with magnetic sensing, which gave trouble. He also developed a [[thermal radiation]] method and did lengthy tests with a [[flake-thermistor detector]], the best [[Far infrared|far-infrared detector]] then available. He and a SwRI electronics technician (Joe Wormser) tried acoustic/seismic methods, and evolved one technique that was fairly promising. They continued to improve instruments and techniques over the years, but could never defeat the many 'false anomalies' produced by variations of tilt and height of the detector, and by inhomogeneities naturally present in the ground. Eighteen years later their reports were declassified, and Cook published a research paper.

== History ==
The group's structure is secretive, but [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]], an adviser to Iran's [[Quds Force]] and former [[Badr Organization]] member, is known to be a senior figure in the group.&lt;ref name="evolution" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36109#.Vy1PUNQrKt8|title=Kata’ib Hezbollah and the Intricate Web of Iranian Military Involvement in Iraq - Jamestown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group receives training and funding from the Quds Force.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="web.stanford.edu" /&gt; The US State department also claimed Lebanon-based [[Hezbollah]] provided weapons and training for the group.&lt;ref&gt;[[Google News]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20101209084727/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gRFukb_mQxUe-bbNC-bnTWNIj1QQ US puts sanctions on Iraq Shiite group, Iran adviser], 1 July 2009, [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]&lt;/ref&gt; It came to prominence in 2007 for attacks against [[Multi-National Force – Iraq|American and coalition forces]],&lt;ref name="globalsecurity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="designation" /&gt; and was known for uploading its videos of attacks on American forces on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/07/hezbollah_brigades_p.php|title=Hezbollah Brigades propaganda specialist captured in Baghdad|last1=Roggio |first1=Bill |date= 21 July 2008|website=[[Long War Journal]] |accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Summer 2008 US and Iraqi Forces launched a crackdown against Kata'ib Hezbollah and the "[[Special Groups (Iraq)|Special Groups]]", the US military term for Iran-backed militias in Iraq. At least 30 of its members were captured during those months. Many of the group's leaders were captured and US officials claimed that "as result much of the leadership fled to Iran".&lt;ref&gt;[[Google News]] [http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iXFldvDeEgr9cymXdQWf-QId7BqA US says five Iranian proxy insurgents held in Iraq], 27 September 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003135853/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iXFldvDeEgr9cymXdQWf-QId7BqA |date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/07/iraqi_us_forces_keep.php|title=Iraqi, US forces keep pressure on the Mahdi Army|last1=Roggio |first1=Bill |date=21 July 2008|website=[[Long War Journal]] |accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2009 the group was added to the [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations]]. The group was held responsible for numerous [[Improvised explosive device|IED]] bombings, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], [[rocket]] and [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]] attacks as well as [[sniper]] operations, targeting US and Iraqi Forces and the [[Green Zone]], including a November 2008 rocket attack that killed two U.N. workers.&lt;ref name="designation"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE56165320090702 |title=U.S. declares Iraq-based group foreign terrorist organization|date= 2 July 2009|agency=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, 2009, the group intercepted the unencrypted video feed of MQ-1 Predator UAVs above Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Michael |last1=Hoffman |first2=John |last2=Reed |first3=Joe |last3=Gould |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2009/12/airforce_uav_hack_121809w/ |title=Fixes on the way for nonsecure UAV links |date=20 December 2009 |work=[[Navy Times]] |accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

12 February 2010 a firefight with suspected members of Kata'ib Hezbollah occurred {{convert|265|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Baghdad in a village near the Iranian border, the U.S. military said. Twelve people were arrested, it said. "The joint security team was fired upon by individuals dispersed in multiple residential buildings ... members of the security team returned fire, killing individuals assessed to be enemy combatants," the military said in a statement. The Provincial Iraqi officials said many of the dead were innocent bystanders, and demanded compensation. They said eight people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61B24Y20100212 |agency=Reuters |title=Five killed as U.S., Iraqi troops raid border village |date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July 2010 General [[Ray Odierno]] named Kata'ib Hezbollah as being behind threats against American bases in Iraq. "In the last couple weeks there's been an increased threat ... and so we've increased our security on some of our bases," Odierno told reporters at a briefing in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-50093520100713 |agency=Reuters |title=Iran-backed force threatens U.S. Iraq bases – general |date=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, an Iraqi intelligence official estimated the group's size at 1,000 fighters and said the militants were paid between $300 to $500 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jakes |first1=Lara|last2=Abdul-Zahra|first2=Qassim|title=Shiite militias increase attacks on US troops |url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20110701/NEWS/107019739/1052/news01&amp;Template=printart|website=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iran-times.com/us-officials-name-3-iraqi-militias-armed-by-iran-to-kill-yanks/|title=US officials name 3 Iraqi militias armed by Iran to kill yanks|work=Iran Times|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Cri de Paris 1913.jpg|right|thumb|Share of the ''Le Cri de Paris'' SA, issued 1. May 1913]]
'''''Le Cri de Paris''''' is an illustrated French political magazine that was founded by [[Alexandre Natanson]] in 1897 and was at the beginning a supplement of ''[[La Revue Blanche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=Russell T.|last2=Houzé|first2=Annick |last3=Erbolato-Ramsey|first3=Christiane|year=2004|title=A Sourcebook of Gauguin's Symbolist Followers: Les Nabis, Pont-Aven, Rose + Croix|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=418|isbn=9780313312052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Cri de Paris'' title means ''The Paris [[Protest]]'' in English, but it has in French two other meanings like ''Paris Fashion'' (as in « ''le dernier cri'' », ''chic'', etc.) and ''cri'' as in ''cris de Paris'', i.e. the [[street cries]]. This ambiguous title was forged by [[Félix Fénéon]].

The magazine covered news, political articles and satire.&lt;ref name="ety"&gt;{{cite web|title=1927 Le Cri de Paris|url=https://www.etsy.com/listing/483614449/1927-magazine-le-cri-de-paris?ref=market|work=Etsy|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Juan Gris]] was one of its illustrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Beaucorps |first1=Monique |last2=Ergmann|first2=Raoul|year=1998|title=Great Masters of European Painting|publisher=Harry N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6851">A '''hereditary monarchy''' is the most common style of [[monarchy]] and is the form that is used by almost all of the world's existing monarchies.

Under a hereditary monarchy, all the monarchs come from the same family, and the crown is passed down from one member to another member of the family. The hereditary system has the advantages of stability, continuity and predictability, as well as the internal stabilizing factors of family affection and loyalty.

The following list is a list of hereditary monarchies and their current ({{As of|2008|lc=on}}) monarchs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10657">This is a list of titles used by authoritarian political leaders. Various [[authoritarian]] political leaders in various official positions assumed, formally or not, similar titles suggesting the power to speak for the nation itself. Most commonly the title is a form of "leader" or "guide", such as "[[Maximum Leader (disambiguation)|Maximum Leader]]". See [[dictatorship]].

==Before the Second World War==

Some of the titles used by dictators before World War II were:

*The style ''Vozhd'', meaning Chief, was conferred to [[Karađorđe Petrović|George Karađorđe Petrović]] for his [[Serbian nationalism|nationalistic]] leadership in the uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] on 1804.
*The [[List of Presidents of Paraguay|Paraguayan President]] [[José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia]] used, among other titles, ''El Supremo'' (The Supreme) and ''Dictador Perpetuo'' (Perpetual Dictator).

==In the 1940s and parts of the 1950s==
[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].]]
Such titles used by heads of state and/or government during the [[Second World War]] include:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* ''Führer'' ("leader" or "guide") [[Adolf Hitler]], from 1933 to 1945 dictator of [[Germany]] (formally "[[Führer]] and Reich [[List of Chancellors of Germany|Chancellor]]").
* ''Vozhd'' ("leader") [[Joseph Stalin]], dictator of [[Soviet Union]] has also been referred to as ''Father of Nations'', "Great Leader",  "General Secretary", "Generalisimus", "The Man of Steel", "Brilliant Genius of Humanity", "Great Architect of Communism", "Gardener of Human Happiness", "Dear Father".
* ''Duce'' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''dux'' meaning "guide") [[Benito Mussolini]], from 1925 to 1943 dictator of [[Italy]] (formally "[[Prime Minister of Italy|Head of Government]]").
* ''Vodca'' ("Leader") monsignor [[Jozef Tiso]], from 1942 self-styled, in [[Slovakia]], President 1939–1945 (acting to 26 October 1939).
* [[Conducător]] ("leader"), a title used by [[Ion Antonescu]] and [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] in [[Romania]].
* "Maršal" (Serbian for "general" or "leader")-referred to [[Josip Broz Tito]], dictator of the [[Yugoslavia]] 
* ''[[Caudillo|El Caudillo]] de España'' ("the Chieftain of [[Spain]]") Generalísimo [[Francisco Franco Bahamonde]], ''Jefe de Estado'' (Chief of State) and "Chief of Government" (Prime Minister). He adopted this title for himself and came to power after winning the [[Spanish civil war]]. During World War II he maintained the neutrality of Spain. In fact the titles of Franco and [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] (in [[Portugal]]) were used officially and rather than personally (cf: "''mein führer''" or "mio duce" my fuhrer and my duce). It is alleged that it was often used as a protocolary title; preceded with [[By the Grace of God]] it would indicate that the Spanish People had been luckily spared from the ''Soviet invasion''.
* ''[[Naczelnik Państwa]]'' (Chief of State) [[Józef Piłsudski]], dictator of [[Poland]] from 1926 to 1935.
* ''[[Poglavnik]] Nezavisne Države Hrvatske'' ("Chief of the Independent State of Croatia") [[Ante Pavelić]], in power in [[Croatia]] 10 April 1941 – 6 May 1945.
* [[Vidkun Quisling]], ''Fører'' ("leader", "guide"), (formally [[Minister-president]]), premier of the Nazi puppet government in [[Norway]], and after [[Reichskommissar]] [[Josef Terboven]] the highest official in occupied Norway, reporting directly to [[Adolf Hitler]].
* ''Leider'' ("leader"), a title used by [[Anton Mussert]], the leader of [[Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging]] (National Socialist Movement) in the [[Netherlands]]. Though styled "leader" under the German occupation, he was not a real dictator as he had little actual power. In fact [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] was in charge of the Netherlands on behalf of the Nazi regime.
* ''Nemzetvezető'' ("leader of the nation"), a title used by [[Ferenc Szálasi]], the chief of the ''Nyilaskeresztes Párt'' ([[Arrow Cross Party]]) who succeeded [[Miklós Horthy]] in [[Hungary]].
* ''Arhigos'' ("chief" or "leader"), a title used by General [[Ioannis Metaxas]] of [[Greece]]'s [[4th of August Regime]].
* ''Adipati'' ("chief of state" or "generalissimo"), the title used by [[Ba Maw]] of the [[Japan]]ese satellite [[State of Burma]]
* Udhëheqësi [i partisë dhe i popullit] ynë i madh, Our great guide [of the party and of the people], the most common title used by Albanian communist dictator [[Enver Hoxha]].
* Or even simply [[President]] as did for example, [[Getúlio Vargas]] of Brazil, from 1930 to 1945 as well as the generals during the 1964–1985 regime.
{{div col end|2}}

Other 'leaders' of contemporary political groups who never achieved power:
* ''Capitanul'' 'The Captain' [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] of the "[[Iron Guard]]" in Romania.
* ''El Jefe'' 'The Chief' [[Jorge González von Marées]] of the Chilean ''Nacistas'' (Chilean-Spanish word for "Nazis"), who failed a coup d'état in 1938.[[File:President Nixon meets with China's Communist Party Leader, Mao Tse- Tung, 02-29-1972 - NARA - 194759.tif|thumb|Chinese Communist Leader [[Mao Zedong]] meets with US President [[Richard Nixon]]. Mao's policies during his rule from 1949 to 1976 are believed to have caused the deaths of more than 80 million people.]]
* ''Vozhd'' 'Leader' [[Konstantin Rodzaevsky]] of the Russian Fascist Party, only active in exile in [[Manchuria]], most admired Mussolini but saw action only in the anti-Communist service of the Japanese Empire.
* the ''American Führer'' [[Fritz Julius Kuhn|Fritz Kuhn]].
* ''Chief'' [[William Dudley Pelley]] of the U.S. [[Silver Legion of America]].
* [[Adrien Arcand]], self-proclaimed ''Canadian Führer''
* ''Tindis'' or ''Tandis'' (leader of a confederation of ''[[barangay]]s'') used by the [[Sakdalista]] Party leader [[Benigno Ramos]] during the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], under United States sovereignty.

In areas occupied by the Axis powers, some states or ethnic-cultural communities aspiring to national self-determination found they were not handed real power by their victorious German allies as they had hoped. Their nationalist leaders, too weak to gain control independently, were simply used as pawns.

Such Nazi collaborators include ''De Leider'' "leader" [[Staf De Clercq]] of the VNV (Flemish National League) in [[Flanders]] (the Dutch-speaking northern majority of Belgium), who had dreamed of a 'Diets' nation uniting Flanders, the Netherlands and ''Frans-Vlaanderen'' (the French part of historic Flanders, united with Belgium into one military occupation zone and ''Reichskommissariat''). Even when the Germans decided in December 1944, after the allied breakthrough, to carve up Belgium, leaving only bicultural capital Brussels under the [[Reichskommissar]], the post of ''Landsleider van het Vlaamsche Volk'' ('Land leader of the Flemish people') of the new ''[[Reichsgau]]'' (integral 'Germanic' part of the Reich, in this case merely on paper) ([[Flanders|Flandern]], ''Vlaanderen'' in Dutch; capital Anwerp) went to another collaborating party, [[Devlag]], in the person of [[Jef Van de Wiele]] (1902–1979), 15 December 1944 – 1945, in exile in Germany as the Allies controlled all Belgium since September 1944; meanwhile in the Francophone south of Belgium, partially reconquered by German troops (December 1944 – January 1945), the equivalent post of ''Chef du Peuple Wallon'' ('Leader of the Walloon People'), at the head of the [[Wallonia|''Reichsgau Wallonien'']], went to [[Léon Degrelle]] (in exile in Germany) of the Belgicist Rex Party.

=== Postwar era and the Cold War ===
[[File:Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], Zaire's longtime dictator, embezzled over $5&amp;nbsp;billion from his country.]]
In the [[postwar]] era, dictatorship became a frequent feature of military government, especially in [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. In the case of many African or Asian former colonies, after achieving their independence in the postwar wave of [[decolonization]], [[presidential]] regimes were gradually transformed into personal dictatorships. These regimes often proved unstable, with the personalization of power in the hands of the dictator and his associates, making the political system uncertain.

During the [[Cold War]], [[Cuba]] and the [[USSR]] managed to expand or maintain their influence zones by financing [[paramilitary]] and political groups and encouraging [[coups d'état]], especially in Africa, that have led many countries to brutal [[civil wars]] and consequent manifestations of authoritarianism. In Latin America the threat of either [[communism]] or [[capitalism]] was often used as justification for dictatorship.

====Individual cases====

*[[Idi Amin]]'s official title while in office as [[President of Uganda]] was 'His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular'. He also claimed to be the uncrowned [[King of Scotland]].
*In the North Korean hereditary system, [[Kim Il-sung]] and [[Kim Jong-il]] used the titles ''Great Leader'' and ''Dear Leader'' respectively.
*[[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], once ''de facto'' [[Libya]]n [[head of state]], used the titles "Guide of the First of September Great Revolution of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab [[Jamahiriya]]" and "Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution".
*In [[Romania]], Communist Party leader and president [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] even had the same title, ''Conducător'' (Romanian for leader), as earlier dictator Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]].
*[[Saparmurat Niyazov]], the late [[president for life]] of the Republic of [[Turkmenistan]], and former leader of the Turkmen communist party and later of the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] (the country's only political party), assumed from 22 October 1993 the unique, paternalistic national title ''Turkmenbashi'' (''Türkmenbaşy'' in [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]), which means "Head of (all) the Turkmens".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/22/tomparfitt.mainsection Bizarre, brutal and self-obsessed. Now time's up for Turkmenistan's dictator]". ''The Guardian''. December 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Mali]], [[Moussa Traore]] gave himself the title President for Life, but was deposed in 1991.
*A Pakistani General, [[Pervez Musharraf]], called himself "chief executive" after 1999 coup.
*Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chavez]] was called ''El Comandante'

The '''Minister for Parliamentary Business''' is a junior ministerial post in the [[Scottish Government]] whose job it is to steer government business through the [[Scottish Parliament]]. It is currently held by [[Graeme Dey]] of the [[Scottish National Party]]. Dey also holds ministerial responsibility for military [[veterans]], making the full title of the post '''Minister for Parliamentary Business and Veterans'''.&lt;ref name="june2018"/&gt; The minister does not attend cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/ukpga_19980046_en_1 Scotland Act (1998)], ''Only those appointed under Section 47 of the Scotland Act "attend" Cabinet. Junior ministers are appointed under Section 49 and may be "present".''&lt;/ref&gt; but supports the [[Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations]], who is a full member of the [[Scottish Cabinet|cabinet]].

==History of the office==
The post was originally created in May 1999 as '''Chief Whip and Government Business Manager''' as a cabinet position in the Labour Liberal [[Scottish Executive]] along with the junior '''Deputy Business Manager''', both positions where renamed after a few weeks to the '''Minister for Parliament''' and '''Deputy Minister for Parliament''' respectively. The posts where renamed again in November 2001 to '''Minister for Parliamentary Business''' and '''Deputy Minister for Parliamentary Business''' following the election of Jack McConnell as First Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Research%20briefings%20and%20fact%20sheets/Ministers_and_Law_Officers_by_cabinet-__Session_1.pdf |title=Ministers, Law Officers and Ministerial Parliamentary Aides by Cabinet: Session 1 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |date=30 March 2007|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The a cabinet post was downgrade to that of a junior minister reporting to the First Minister following the election of an SNP minority government in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/Ministers_Law_Officers_Parliamentary_Liaison_Officers_S3.pdf |title=Scottish Parliament Fact sheet: Ministers, Law Officers and Parliamentary Liaison Officers by Cabinet: Session 3|publisher=[[Scottish Parliament]] |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post remained a junior one until the [[2011 Scottish general election|May 2011 general election]] after which a new cabinet post of '''Cabinet Secretary for Parliamentary Business and Government Strategy''' was established with the '''Minister for Parliamentary Business and Chief Whip''' reporting to it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefingsAndFactsheets/Scottish_Ministers_Law_Officers_and_Parliamentary_Liaison_Officers_S4.pdf |title=Scottish Parliament Fact sheet: Ministers, Law Officers and Parliamentary Liaison Officers by Cabinet: Session 4 |publisher=Scottish Parliament |date=2 September 2015|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  this set up remained in place until a government reshuffle in September 2012 saw the cabinet post abolished with responsibility of Government Strategy being given to the [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19487544 |title=Scottish cabinet reshuffle: Nicola Sturgeon given new independence role |work=[[BBC News]] |date=5 September 2012|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the post of Minister for Parliamentary Business being re-established reporting to both First Minister and Deputy First Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/People/14944/Scottish-Cabinet |title=Cabinet and Ministers: Biographies and responsibilities |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This changed in the reshuffle announced on 21 November 2014, with [[Joe FitzPatrick]] reporting directly to [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland]], [[John Swinney]]. In the June 2018 reshuffle cabinet level responsibility for parliamentary business was assigned to the [[Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations]], who is supported by the Minister for Parliamentary Business and Veterans.&lt;ref name=june2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/about/who-runs-government/cabinet-and-ministers/minister-for-parliamentary-business-veterans/|title=Minister for Parliamentary Business and Veterans|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10380">Founded in 1947, the '''Mouvement national des Québécoises et des Québécois''' (MNQ) is a federation that groups together the various patriotic organizations in [[Quebec]], Canada. Its membership includes 19 National Societies (''Sociétés nationales'') and [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society|Saint-Jean-Baptiste Societies]] (SSJB) throughout all of Quebec.

Its stated mission is to "promote and defend the French language and national pride". Since 1984, the MNQ is responsible for coordinating the festivities for Quebec's [[National Holiday (Quebec)|national holiday]] on June 24. The current president is [[Martine Desjardins]].

== Mission ==
Following the [[Estates General of French Canada]], whose preparation began in 1964 and occurred between 1967 and 1969, the MNQ took a stance in favour of an independent Quebec and gave itself the mission to promote:

* A [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] and [[representative democracy|democratic]] Quebec
* French as the [[national language]] of Quebec
* Quebec pride&lt;ref&gt;MNQ.

== History ==
In 1947, nine of Quebec's SSJB (those of [[Sherbrooke]], [[Trois-Rivières]], [[Quebec City]], [[Rimouski]], [[Saint-Hyacinthe]], [[Nicolet, Quebec|Nicolet]], [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], Saint-Jean and [[Chicoutimi]]), formed the ''Fédération des Sociétés Saint-Jean-Baptiste du Québec'' during a congress in Sherbrooke.&lt;ref name="Une histoire pour l'avenir !"&gt;MNQ. "[http://www.mnq.qc.ca/main.cfm?p=01_100 Une histoire pour l'avenir !] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518134636/http://www.mnq.qc.ca/main.cfm?p=01_100 |date=2007-05-18 }}", in the site of the ''Mouvement national des Québécoises et Québécois'', 2008, retrieved June 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This happened not long after the start of diverging opinions among the members of the ephemeral federation (1945–1946), whose members counted all the SSJB of Quebec and Ontario. In spite of this failure, the SSJB of Quebec and Ontario continued to collaborate closely up until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;CRCCF. "[http://www.crccf.uottawa.ca/passeport/III/C3a/IIIC3a06.html Les sociétés Saint-Jean-Baptiste de l'Ontario et les liens avec le Québec]" in the site ''La présence française en Ontario : 1610, passeport pour 2010''. Centre de recherche en civilisation canadienne-française de l'Université d'Ottawa, 2003, retrieved June 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Quebec federation initiated various actions and took part in the efforts for the development of Quebec which accelerated after [[World War II]]. The federation participated to the popular movement that led to the adoption of the ''fleurdelisé'' as Quebec's [[Flag of Quebec|Flag]] in 1948, organized the [[National Conference on Education]] which led, in 1964, to the creation of a [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|Quebec Ministry of Education]], and helped with setting in motion the Estates General of French Canada.

In 1969, the federation's position was "in favour of the total political sovereignty of Quebec", affirming that sovereignty "is an essential condition for a methodical (orderly)  development of the human, physical and economic resources of the Quebec community."&lt;ref name="Une histoire pour l'avenir !"/&gt;

In 1972, influenced by the secularization movement that affected all of Quebec's institutions at the time, the federation changed their name to "Mouvement national des Québécois" (Quebecers' National Movement). Strongly committed against [[institutional bilingualism]] and for territorial unilingualism, the MNQ was active in the political movement that opposed the ''[[An Act to promote the French language in Quebec|Act to promote the French language in Quebec]]'' (1969) and the ''[[Official Language Act (Quebec)|Official Language Act]]'' (1974) and supported the [[Parti Québécois]]'s (PQ) proposed interventionist policy.

The defeat of the sovereigntist option in the Quebec [[Quebec referendum, 1980|referendum of 1980]] consequently left the MNQ disoriented. In 1982, its office closed and dissolving the federation was discussed.&lt;ref name="Une histoire pour l'avenir !"/&gt;

In 1984, the SSJB's 150th anniversary, the government of Quebec entrusted the MNQ with the responsibility of coordinating Quebec's [[National Holiday (Quebec)|national holiday]] festivities.

In 1991, the MNQ changed their name to ''Mouvement national des Québécoises et des Québécois'', but kept the acronym "MNQ". This change reflected the movement's support of feminism.

In 2007, the federation celebrated its 60th anniversary.

The MNQ leadership, along with the [[Bloc Québécois]], impels the federal government of Canada to respect the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' and withdraw from the field of telecommunications as a consequence of the adoption of the [[Québécois nation motion|motion recognizing that Quebecers form a nation within Canada]] by the [[House of Commons of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5j23emKInsmU-rY-3SBX42_uX1t6w Nation québécoise: Au tour du MNQ d'exiger d'Ottawa des gestes concrets]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''La Presse Canadienne'', retrieved June 21, 2008{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also supports PQ [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] member [[Daniel Turp]]'s initiative to obtain a .qc country code for Quebec following the precedent of a [[.cat]] for [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.webhostdir.com/showthread.php?p=57217 Quebec Want Country Code .qc]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, in ''Web Host Directory'', retrieved June 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

NSi is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and in the European Parliament its MEP [[Lojze Peterle]] sits with the [[European People's Party (European Parliament group)|EPP Group]]. NSi won 4.88% of the vote at the early [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 Slovenian parliamentary election]] on 4 December 2011, thus gaining 4 seats in the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]].&lt;ref name="DVK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volitve.gov.si/dz2011/en/index.html |title=Republic of Slovenia Early Elections for Deputies to the National Assembly 2011 |publisher=National Electoral Commission |accessdate=16 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801150748/http://volitve.gov.si/dz2011/en/index.html |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment==
In July 2000, [[Andrej Bajuk]], by the time Prime Minister of a centre-right coalition government, and other centrist Christian democrats disagreed with the rest of the [[Slovenian People's Party]] (SLS+SKD) over the question of a new electoral system. While Bajuk wanted the National Assembly to abandon [[proportional representation]], the SLS+SKD party voted against any changes. Therefore, Bajuk retired from the party and created New Slovenia as his Prime Ministerial vehicle. Other former members of the [[Slovene Christian Democrats]] opposed to the merger of SKD and SLS, followed the foundation appeal. In the October [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary election]], the new party won 8.6% of the vote and eight seats. Thereupon, Bajuk resigned as Prime Minister and New Slovenia went into opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=Alan John |last1=Day |first2=Roger |last2=East |first3=Richard |last3=Thomas |title=New Slovenia – Christian People's Party |work=A political and economic dictionary of Eastern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=410 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dt2TXexiKTgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=new%20slovenia&amp;f=false |accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
New Slovenia has taken a staunchly Christian conservative position on some issues, advocating traditional social values and defending the position of the Catholic Church on moral questions.&lt;ref name="ZajcBoh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Roman |last=Kuhar |title=Homosexuality as a Litmus Test for Democracy and Postmodern Value Orientations |work=Democratic transition in Slovenia: Value transformation, education, and media |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |year=2006 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OegWny-r8TEC&amp;pg=PA104 |accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been opposed to [[same-sex marriage]] and adoption by same sex couples, although it does support (and it also voted for) the current legislation, which gives certain rights to registered same sex couples.

In economic issues, it is generally liberal, but it defends a [[social market economy]]. It is a decidedly pro-European party.&lt;ref name="ZajcBoh"/&gt;

==Since 2004==
From 2004 to 2008, New Slovenia was part of the centre-right coalition led by Prime Minister [[Janez Janša]].

The first [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Slovenia)|European Parliament election]] with Slovenian participation in 2004 was won by New Slovenia which received 24% of the votes and secured two of the seven Slovenian seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=John K. |last=Cox |title=Slovenia: evolving loyalties |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NV9Ky3VCo3sC&amp;pg=PA119 |accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 legislative elections]], the party won only 3.4% of the popular vote and did not win any seats in the 90-seat [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly]]. After the elective failure of 2008, Bajuk announced his immediate resignation and retirement from politics. [[Ljudmila Novak]] succeeded him as party president.

At the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 Slovenian parliamentary election]] on 4 December 2011, it won 4.88% of votes, thus gaining four seats in the National Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volitve.gov.si/dz2011/en/rezultati/rezultati_slo.html |title=Republic of Slovenia Early Elections for Deputies to the National    Assembly 2011: Election results |date=7 December 2011 |publisher=National Electoral Commission |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717041115/http://volitve.gov.si/dz2011/en/rezultati/rezultati_slo.html |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Slovenia)|2014 European election]], NSi ran in a joint electoral list with the [[Slovenian People's Party]], which received 16.56% of the vote and came in second place, returning 2 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delo.si/assets/info5/20140525/EUvolitve2014/volitve.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The party received 5.53% of the vote in the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2014|Slovenian parliamentary election]] on 13 July 2014, and won 5 seats in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volitve.gov.si/dz2014/rezultati/rezultati_slo.html Predčasne Volitve V Državni Zbor 2014] Republika Slovenija - Državna volilna komisija.

The '''Newtownhamilton bombing''' was a [[car bomb|carbombing]] carried out by the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) on 24 June 1998 in the [[Armagh]] border village of [[Newtownhamilton]] shortly after the signing of the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]] by the [[Irish government]], [[British government]] [[Irish nationalism|Nationalist]] and [[British Unionism|Unionist]] parties as well as parties which represented [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] and [[Ulster Loyalism|Loyalist]] paramilitaries. The INLA and its political wing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party|IRSP]] were opposed to the agreement. The bombing was one of the last actions carried out or claimed by the INLA during the 30-year conflict known as [[the Troubles]]

==Background==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2017}}
The Good Friday Agreement was signed on 10 April 1998 and was approved by most major paramilitaries on the Republican and Loyalist sides of the conflict like the [[Provisional IRA]] (PIRA) and the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) but was opposed by smaller dissident groups on each side like the [[Real IRA]] (RIRA, formed in 1997 after splitting with the PIRA), the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (formed in 1996 after splitting with the UVF) and the INLA itself.

The car bomb attack took place during a time of high activity by dissident Irish Republicans especially by the Real IRA and [[Continuity IRA]] mainly in protest at the Good Friday Agreement which dissidents argued was a document of surrender to the British government, [[Sinn Féin]] argued it was a huge stepping stone to a [[United Ireland]] and that the armed struggle had gone as far as it could go and further loss of life was pointless and immoral.

==Bombing==

The car bomb exploded in the predominantly Catholic border town of Newtownhamilton close to a polling station, injuring six people including a 15-year-old boy despite the INLA giving a 50-minute warning as police were still trying to evacuate people from the bomb area. The bomb was estimated to have weighed 200&amp;nbsp;lbs and along with the injured it caused widespread damage. The financial damage from the attack was estimated at £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/bomb-damage-in-village-put-at-2m-1.166950|title=Bomb damage in village put at £2m|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police believed the Real IRA supplied the INLA with Semtex commercial explosive which was thought to have been used as a component in  making the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch98.htm#Jun|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1998|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing was seen as a "protest attack" as it happened the day before Northern Ireland Assembly Elections took place on the 25 June 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/ra1998.htm|title=CAIN: Issue: Politics: Elections: Assembly Election (NI) Thursday 25 June 1998|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Two months later on 15 August the [[Omagh bombing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=15&amp;month=08&amp;year=1998|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by the Real IRA killed almost 30 people and injured over 250 more. The shock and outrage in Ireland and Britain over the human cost of the bomb was such that the Real IRA soon called a ceasefire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/docs/rira18898b.htm|title=CAIN: Events: Peace Process: "real" IRA statement 2, 18 August 1998|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so did the INLA on 22 August 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/docs/inla22898.htm|title=CAIN: Events: Peace: Ceasefire Statement issued by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), Saturday 22 August 1998|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing an end to their 24-year paramilitary campaign which killed over 100 people and injured hundreds more.
Almost a year later on 8 August 1999 the INLA issued a statement saying: "There is no political or moral argument to justify a resumption of the campaign."

In its official website, ''Ni una menos'' defines itself as a "collective cry against [[Machismo|machista]] violence."&lt;ref name="quees"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://niunamenos.com.ar/?page_id=6|title=Qué es Ni una menos|language=Spanish|publisher=Ni una menos|access-date=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was started by a [[collective]] of Argentine female artists, journalists and academics, and has grown into "a continental alliance of feminist forces".&lt;ref name="jacobinmag"/&gt; The movement regularly holds protests against [[femicide]]s, but has also touched on topics such as [[gender role]]s, [[sexual harassment]], [[gender pay gap]], [[sexual objectification]], [[legality of abortion]], [[sex workers' rights]] and [[transgender rights]]. The movement has been criticized by some journalists, especially since 2017, for some of its demands, such as the freedom of [[Milagro Sala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elintransigente.com/sociedad/2017/6/5/politizacion-menos-aspero-debate-intratables-mira-video-439595.html|title=La politización de Ni Una Menos: áspero debate en Intratables.

The movement became nationally recognized with the use of the [[hashtag]] '''#NiUnaMenos''' on [[social media]], title under which massive [[Demonstration (protest)|demonstrations]] were held on June 3, 2015, having the [[Palace of the Argentine National Congress]] as a main meeting point.

In 2016, Argentine scientists Julián Petrulevicius and Pedro Gutiérrez named ''Tupacsala niunamenos'', a [[dragonfly]] species found in [[La Rioja Province, Argentina|La Rioja]], after the movement.

==Origin==
The collective takes its name from a 1995 phrase by Mexican poet and activist [[Susana Chávez]], "''Ni una muerta más''" (Spanish for "Not one more [woman] dead"), in protest to the [[female homicides in Ciudad Juárez]]. Chávez herself was assassinated in 2011, moment in which the phrase became a "symbol of struggle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.minutouno.com/notas/365815-niunamenos-quien-fue-la-autora-la-consigna-que-une-miles-contra-la-violencia-genero|language=Spanish|title=#NiUnaMenos: ¿Quién fue la autora de la consigna que une a miles contra la violencia de género?|date=June 3, 2015|publisher=Minutouno.com|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elcomercio.pe/eldominical/accion-noticia-501563|language=Spanish|title=El tiempo de la acción|last=Subirana Abanto|first=Katherine|date=March 4, 2018|work=[[El Comercio (Peru)|El Comercio]]|accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first protest organized by ''Ni una menos'' was held in [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires]] on March 26, 2015, and consisted of a reading marathon, [[performance art]] and screenings; the catalyst of the event was the murder of Daiana García, found dead in a garbage bag on March 16.&lt;ref name="surcapitalino"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surcapitalino.com.ar/detalle_noticias.php?Id=3598|title=Maratón de lectura contra los femicidios |language=Spanish|date=March 26, 2015|publisher=Sur Capitalino|access-date=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic background ==

Nattrass received her undergraduate and master's degrees from [[Stellenbosch University]] and [[University of Natal]], a master's degree in development economics and a doctorate degree with a thesis on 'Wages, Profits and Apartheid' from [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name=nattrass1/&gt; She was a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/page/sa-scholar-contacts|title=Rhodes Scholar List|work=Oxford University|accessdate=6 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223055357/http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/page/sa-scholar-contacts|archivedate=23 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works to counter AIDS denialism ==

{{Main|HIV/AIDS denialism}}

Between 2002 and 2012, Nattrass published a number of academic articles and books&lt;ref name=nattrass1/&gt;&lt;ref name=nattrass2/&gt; to examine the history, sources, characteristics of AIDS denialism and its impact on HIV prevention and AIDS treatment.

She demonstrated that by not implementing mother to child transmission prevention programs, the cost to treat sick children who acquired AIDS from their mother was greater than to prevent the tragedy from happening.

Nattrass estimated that Mbeki's denialist policies led to the early deaths of more than 340,000 South Africans and 171,000 infections, which she likened to 'genocide'.  She attributed the slow and ineffective governmental response to the country's massive AIDS epidemic directly to the influence of the AIDS denialists.&lt;ref name=nattrass3/&gt;

In her 2012 article in [[Skeptical Inquirer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nattrass|first1=Nicoli|title=The Social and Symbolic Power of AIDS Denialism|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|volume=36|issue=July/August|pages=34–38|year=2012|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and book ''The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nattrass|first=Nicoli|title= The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back|year=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|ISBN=0231149123|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass examines the landscape of the AIDS denialist community and identifies four groups of characters: hero scientists (provide scientific credibility); cultropreneurs (promote non-evidence based, unproven alternative treatment); living icons (proof that HIV is not the cause of AIDS) and praise singers (journalists and film makers who promote the cause). She observes that they each fill their own important role in the intractable propagation of the movement and their intertwined and symbiotic relationships are established through their shared anti-science and conspiratorial stance, and beliefs in alternative medicine and treatment. Nattrass describes how pro-science activists fought back by deploying empirical evidence and giving political credibility to refute AIDS conspiracy theories, as part of the crucial project to defend evidence-based medicine and combat pseudoscience.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Other works ==

Nattrass has collaborated with the United Nation Research Institute for Social Development for which she co-authored the South African study for the project ‘Poverty Reduction and Policy Regimes’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/projects.nsf/(httpAuxPages)/9B8811D1BC49A053C12577540041DB17|title=Poverty Reduction and Policy Regimes|author=United Nations Research Institute for Social Development|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass also was a visiting professor at Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jackson.yale.edu/nattrass-0|title=Visiting Professor, Jackson Institute for Global Affairs|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=7 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526033151/http://jackson.yale.edu/nattrass-0|archivedate=26 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Official Secrets Act 1972''' ({{lang-ms|Akta Rahsia Rasmi 1972}}, abbreviated '''OSA'''), is a statute in [[Malaysia]] prohibiting the dissemination of information classified as an official secret. The legislation is based on the [[Official Secrets Act]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. After criticism of the act for lacking clarity, it was amended in 1986.&lt;ref name="hickling"&gt;Wu, Min Aun &amp; Hickling, R. H. (2003). ''Hickling's Malaysian Public Law'', pp. 91&amp;ndash;92. Petaling Jaya: Pearson Malaysia. {{ISBN|983-74-2518-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==

The act defines an "official secret" as:

{{quote|...any document specified in the Schedule and any information and material relating thereto and includes any other official document, information and material as may be classified as 'Top Secret', 'Secret', 'Confidential' or 'Restricted', as the case may be, by a Minister, the Menteri Besar or Chief Minister of a State or such public officer}}

The Schedule to the Act covers "Cabinet documents, records of decisions and deliberations including those of Cabinet committees", as well as similar documents for state executive councils. It also includes "documents concerning national security, defence and international relations".

==Criticism==
The act has been criticised for ostensibly stifling dissent and reducing transparency in government workings. One statesman has suggested that the act has turned the press into "an alternative Government Gazette". In addition, the usage of the act to classify documents which "cannot by any stretch of the imagination be reasonably confidential or secret" has been criticised.&lt;ref name="hickling"/&gt;

==Structure==
The Official Secrets Act 1972, in its current form (1 January 2006), consists of 31 sections and 1 schedule (including 9 amendments), without separate Part.
* Section 1: Short title
* Section 2: Interpretation

'''Partit per la Independència''' ('''PI'''; {{IPA-ca|pəɾˈtit pəɾ lə indəpənˈdɛnsiə}}) was a short lived [[political party]] in [[Catalonia]] of the 1990s that campaigned for [[Catalan independentism|independence for Catalonia]] from [[Spain]]. It was created by [[Àngel Colom]] and [[Pilar Rahola]] in 1996&lt;ref&gt;Anuaris.cat, ''[http://www.anuaris.cat/continguts/article.php?id=851 El congrés fundacional del Partit per la Independència] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921183644/http://www.anuaris.cat/continguts/article.php?id=851 |date=2010-09-21 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; as a schism from [[Republican Left of Catalonia]], another independentist party. After the meager electoral results in municipal elections in 1999, particularly in [[Barcelona]] city where Rahola was candidate, Partit per la Independència was dissolved. Afterwards, Colom and most of the party direction integrated into [[Convergència Democràtica de Catalunya]]. [[Joan Laporta]], later president of [[Futbol Club Barcelona]], was member of PI.

==History==
When the UK passed the [[Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883]], this was the first effort ever to regulate the financial dimension of political competition. Although this landmark legislation was concerned with constituency candidates, their campaign expenses and their agents only, all other efforts to create a [[political finance]] regime started from here.

The next legislative step to deal with the subject was the [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act]] 1925 that sought to end the selling of titles in exchange for donations to political parties.

In August 1976 the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties, chaired by Lord Houghton of Sowerby, proposed that financial aid to political parties should be given in two forms:
(a) general grants to the central organisations for their general purposes and 
(b) a limited reimbursement of election expenses to parliamentary and local government candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties, chaired by Lord Houghton of Sowerby, London: H.M.S.O, 1976, Cmnd. 6601, p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2006, political funding came under scrutiny as concerns grew that the largest [[British political parties]] were too dependent on a handful of wealthy donors. Furthermore, during the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal, concern grew even more.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt; A concern of the 1970s had been that the major parties were unable to raise sufficient funds to operate successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties (Chairman: Lord Houghton of Sowerby), London: H.M.S.O., 1976, Cmd. 6601; Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, British Political Finance, 1830-1980. Washington, DC: AEI, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000===
{{main|Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000}}
The [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] (PPERA) was an act that established the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and required all political parties to register with it, set down accounting requirements for political parties, and introduced controls on donations.&lt;ref name="library7" /&gt;

===2006 Sir Hayden Phillips inquiry===
In March 2006, former civil servant [[Sir Hayden Phillips]] was charged with setting up an inquiry to come up with proposal for reform. It reported a year later. He recommended capping individual donations at £50,000&lt;ref name="whitepaper"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Party Finance and Expenditure in the United Kingdom Report  | publisher = [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]  | date = 16 June 2008 | url = http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm73/7329/7329.pdf | accessdate = 1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and capping spending for political campaigns. He also suggested increasing state funding by £25m and expanding its reach.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

===2008 Ministry of Justice report===
In June 2008, the [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]] released a [[white paper]] analyzing party finance and expenditure.&lt;ref name="whitepaper" /&gt; The paper proposed to tighten controls on spending by parties and candidates, substantially strengthen the powers of the Electoral Commission, and increase the transparency of donations.&lt;ref name="minjust"&gt;{{cite web  | title = Party Finance and Expenditure in the United Kingdom  | publisher = [[Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Justice]]  | date = 16 June 2008  | url = http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/party-funding.htm  | accessdate = 1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011 Committee on Standards in Public Life report===
In November 2011 the Committee on Standards on Public Life, chaired by Sir Christopher Kelly, published a Report on "Political Party Finance. Ending the big donor culture". It is their 13th report, Cm. 8208. The report made five main recommendations: (a) Contribution limit of GBP10,000 per donor, party and year; (b) this limit should not apply to [[affiliated trade union]] affiliation fees if such fees are raised by an "opt in"; (c) existing limits for campaign spending should be cut by about 15 per cent; (d) in addition to the present "policy development grant" eligible parties should be granted public funding at the rate of GBP3.00 per vote in Westminster elections and GBP 1.50 per vote in devolved and European elections; (e) income tax relief should be available for donations up to GBP 1,000 and membership fees to political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/336913/13th_Report___Political_party_finance_FINAL_PDF_VERSION_18_11_11.pdf|title=Political party finance: Ending the big donor culture|last=Committee on Standards in Public Life|first=|date=November 2011|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780101820820|series=Thirteenth Report|location=|pages=8-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership subscriptions==
Membership subscriptions ("subs") provide one source of funding for political parties.  However, in recent times membership has declined and campaign costs have grown.

The [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] is the only major political party in the UK which receives the majority of its funding through membership fees and these are what cover the running costs of the organisation. Membership subs have become a more significant source in income for both the SNP and Labour in recent years, as both have seen substantial increases in membership&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greenparty.org.uk/donate|title=Greener Tomorrow {{!}} Green Party Members' Website|website=greenparty.org.uk|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}

==Donations==
The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] relies on donations mostly from individuals and companies; as well as these sources the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] receives a significant portion of its donations from [[trade unions]]. For example, in the third quarter of 2009, eighteen political parties reported donations totalling £9,532,598 (excluding public funds). The Conservative Party received £5,269,186, the Labour party received £3,045,377 and the Liberal Democrats received £816,663.&lt;ref name="electoral-commission-nov-2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/political-parties-latest-donations-and-borrowing-figures-published3|title=Political parties’ latest donations and borrowing figures published|publisher=UK Electoral Commission|date=25 November 2009|accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Donations typically peak before elections.  Between the 6th of April and the 6th of May 2010 (a general election campaign month) the Conservatives took £7,317,602, Labour £5,283,199 and the Liberal Democrats £724,000.&lt;ref name="electoral-commission-may-2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/news-and-media/news-releases/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-donations/party-donations-and-borrowing-in-final-week-of-general-election-campaign-published|title=Party donations and borrowing in final week of general election campaign published|publisher=UK Electoral Commission|date=14 May 2009|accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State funding==
Opposition parties receive state funding to pay administration cost; [[Short Money]]&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="library9"&gt;Gay. ''The Funding of Political Parties''. pp. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] starting in 1975, and [[Cranborne Money]] in the [[House of Lords]] starting in 1996.

In addition there is a general policy development grant available to parties with two MPs or one MP and one MEP.&lt;ref&gt;Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}

==Transparency==
Donations worth over £7,500 to national parties must be declared, as must be donations worth £1,500 or more to local associations.&lt;ref name="electoral-commission-2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/political-parties-campaigning-and-donations/donations-and-loans-to-political-parties/quarterly-donations-and-loans|title=Donations and loans reported every quarter by political parties|publisher=UK Electoral Commission|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donations to members' associations – groups whose members are primarily or entirely members of a single political party – also need to be declared above £7,500. This produces a [[loophole]] where donors can donate larger sums to local candidates while remaining anonymous, by channeling those donations through a members' association such as the [[United and Cecil Club]].&lt;ref name="Indie"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tory-dining-club-secretively-channels-hundreds-of-thousands-of-pounds-of-funding-by-anonymous-9380723.html |title= Tory dining club secretively channels hundreds of thousands of pounds of funding by anonymous wealthy donors |author= Oliver Wright |date= 16 May 2014 |accessdate= 22 February 2017 |newspaper= The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, as a [[loophole]], loans did not have to be declared.&lt;ref name="faq" /&gt;

Northern Ireland political parties are exempt from revealing the identity of party donors due to security reasons.

The '''Krom Pracheachon''' ({{lang-km|ក្រុមប្រជាជន}}, "People's Group"), often referred to simply as '''Pracheachon''', was a [[Cambodia]]n political party that contested in parliamentary elections in 1955, 1958 and 1972.

For much of its existence the party was a legal front organisation for the clandestine [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]].

==Formation==

The Pracheachon came into existence as a result of the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]] of 1954. This guaranteed Cambodia's independence and neutrality, with parliamentary elections to be held the following year. Many of the Cambodians fighting for independence (notably members of the [[United Issarak Front]]) had been associated with the [[Viet Minh]], who now agreed to withdraw their units from Cambodia: a large number of Khmer leftists, led by veteran Issarak [[Son Ngoc Minh]], departed for [[Hanoi]], where they were to remain for the next twenty years.

Those leftists who remained were encouraged to form a legal political party to contest elections: this was the Krom Pracheachon, which had a socialist platform. The Communist Party itself (led by [[Tou Samouth]] and [[Sieu Heng]], and including later prominent figures such as [[Saloth Sar]] (Pol Pot) and [[Ieng Sary]]) continued as a purely clandestine organisation.

The Pracheachon was led by [[Non Suon]], [[Keo Meas]] and [[Penn Yuth]], all former Issaraks.&lt;ref name=kiernan156&gt;Kiernan, Ben. ''How Pol Pot Came to Power''. London: Verso, 1985. pp. 156-157&lt;/ref&gt; It adopted the symbol of a [[plough]].

==The 1955 election==

{{details|Cambodian parliamentary election, 1955}}

The Cambodian elections of 1955 were the first in which the Krom Pracheachon took part. Due to severe harassment of its members by forces loyal to the [[Sangkum]] party of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], the Pracheachon was able to field only 35 candidates, winning 31,034 votes in total and gaining no seats.

According to the historian [[Ben Kiernan]], Sihanouk later appeared to admit that many districts had in fact voted for socialist candidates, even when the official result showed them receiving few or no votes.&lt;ref name=kiernan162&gt;Kiernan, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

==1958 election==
In the period before the 1958 election, Sihanouk appeared deeply concerned with the possibility of [[Viet Minh]] / [[North Vietnam]]ese domination of Cambodia. To coincide with the election, he published a series of articles tracing the history of Cambodian communism: though the articles were perceptive in their analysis of communist tactics, they stressed the leftists' links with Vietnam and presented them as a threat to the Cambodian nation.&lt;ref name=dommen&gt;Dommen, A. ''The Indochinese experience of the French and the Americans'', p.360&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure on the Pracheachon was increased by posters showing buildings and trains destroyed by the Viet Minh, and slogans such as "The Pracheachon ruins the nation and sells the country to foreigners" and "The Pracheachon is not part of the Sangkum" appeared on walls and banners.&lt;ref name="dommen"/&gt;

In the election itself, the Pracheachon managed to field only 5 candidates: 4 of these were to withdraw following police harassment, leaving only Keo Meas himself, who officially received 396 votes. Meas was forced to sit out the election from a safe haven on the Vietnamese border, fearing arrest.

==1962 election==

The Krom Pracheachon was again subject to repressive measures (ostensibly for reasons of "security") in the run-up to the 1962 elections, in which its members hoped to participate.

Sihanouk's police arrested 14 of its remaining members, including Secretary-General Non Suon; they were charged with possessing documents incriminating them in seeking the overthrow of the Sangkum regime by [[North Vietnam]]. They were initially sentenced to death by a military court, with the sentences later being commuted to life imprisonment. The Pracheachon dissolved, and many of the remaining leftists fled [[Phnom Penh]] for the forests, with the exception of several prominent figures ([[Khieu Samphan]], [[Hou Yuon]] and [[Hu Nim]]) who had joined the Sangkum. At around this time Communist leader Tou Samouth disappeared; Saloth Sar assumed the clandestine Party's leadership.

==1972 election==

Following [[Lon Nol]]'s expulsion of Sihanouk in the [[Cambodian coup of 1970]] and the subsequent declaration of the [[Khmer Republic]], the Pracheachon was resurrected, and fielded some candidates against Nol's [[Social Republican Party|Socio-Republican Party]] in the 1972 elections.

It was initially expected that its leader would be the leftist [[Hang Thun Hak]]; Hak instead joined the PSR, and Penn Yuth emerged as its leader.&lt;ref name=corfield&gt;Corfield, J. ''Khmers stand up!: a history of the Cambodian government 1970-1975'', 1994, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Yuth, now an officer in the [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] was however by this time a close associate of Lon Nol, and it was widely thought that the Pracheachon had been reorganised by Nol's brother [[Lon Non]] specifically to provide a 'token' opposition to the PSR.&lt;ref name="corfield"/&gt; Figures associated with the Pracheachon in this period included [[Saloth Chhay]], a left-wing journalist who was the brother of Pol Pot (Saloth Sar). All seats in the elections were won by the Socio-Republican Party.

'''''R v Basi''''' is a [[landmark case|landmark decision]] by [[Supreme Court of Canada]] where the Court weighed the rights of the defendant versus the [[privilege (evidence)|privileges]] of an [[informant]] in an important trial into alleged government corruption.

==Background==
Three employees of the provincial government of [[British Columbia]] were charged with corruption and breach of trust following the [[BC Legislature Raids]].

On Dec. 6, 2007, [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] Justice [[Elizabeth Bennett (judge)|Elizabeth Bennett]] ruled  against a pre-trial Crown request to exclude defence lawyers from an in-camera hearing on information involving a police informant.

===British Columbia Court of Appeal===
The [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] split 2-1 in upholding the trial judge's decision. This allowed the defendants' lawyers to be present during a hearing regarding disclosure of documents to the defence that involved a police informant.

==Reasons of the court==
The Supreme Court of Canada heard the appeal on April 22, 2009. Intervenors were the [[Director of Public Prosecutions#Canada|Director of Public Prosecutions of Canada]], [[Attorney General of Ontario]], [[Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police]] and Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Ontario).

The unanimous judgment was written by [[Morris Fish|Fish J.]]

The Court found that where a hearing is required to determine a claim of informer privilege, the hearing must be held [[ex parte]], without the defendant or their counsel present, but only if it is required to keep the informer's identity confidential. The hearing should only be held ''ex parte'' as necessary.  Trial judges should adopt all reasonable measures to permit defence counsel to make meaningful submissions regarding what occurs in their absence.  Trial judges have broad discretion to craft appropriate procedures in this regard.

The court went on to suggest various methods trial judges may adopt to limit the unfairness to a defendant.

'''Shayfeencom''' ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: ''We are watching you'') is an initiative that started with three Egyptian women (a prominent TV newscaster, a university professor, and a marketing consultant) to help bring [[political reform]] and [[democracy]] to Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/classroom/women/resources/shayfeen_discussion.pdf|title=Shayfeen.com: We're Watching You|work=Independent Lens|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shayfeencom is a popular movement, working on monitoring the legality and integrity of the presidential and parliamentary elections in [[Egypt]] through the participation of the public. The movement aims to end corruption in the governmental and non-governmental institutions through public monitoring, and aims to educate the public to increase awareness of the principles of democracy.

Shayfeencom was officially established in 2005 by a group of non-politically oriented individuals, and started its first [[Election monitoring|monitoring]] and observation experience in [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|Egypt's first multi-candidate presidential elections]]. Within the first month of launching the initiative, 5,000 people volunteered and joined online, and over 1,000 volunteers actively participated in monitoring elections. Today, the movement includes over 10 founding members, and thousands of regular members.

Shayfeencom is a nonprofit organization, without political or economic ideologies; all financing to the movement is done through Egyptian individuals.

==Goals==
Shayfeencom has three primary goals: to end corruption in all public and private institutions through public monitoring, to enable the citizens as key fighters against corruption, and to attain [[Electoral reform|electoral]] and [[judicial reform]].

The main focuses are on:
* [[Corporate corruption]]&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt;
* [[Electoral fraud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://muftah.org/we-are-watching-you-an-interview-with-ahmed-hafez-co-founder-of-egyptian-movement-shayfeencom/| first=Ahmed|last=Hafez| title= An Interview with Ahmed Hafez, Co-Founder of Egyptian Movement, Shayfeencom' |work=Muftah | date =22 Aug 2012| location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Kleptocracy]]&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt;
* [[Police corruption]]&lt;ref name="reuters.com" /&gt;

==Methods==
[[File:SystemShayfeencom.jpg.png|thumb|right|alt=Citizens report to Shayfeencom, which then reports to competent parties and the mass media|Shayfeencom's reporting system]]
Shayfeencom uses its large membership database, all types of [[social media]], and a [[hotline]] to receive reports of corruption in the country; it then files a case against the specified party. If the party does not respond, Shayfeencom uses the media to expose what has occurred; they might also carry out sit-ins and other demonstrations.

In 2007, documentary film director [[Jehane Noujaim]] (with Sherief El Katsha) broadcast the film ''Shayfeen.com'', which was a part of the ''[[Why Democracy?]]'' project.

==Members==
Originally, the movement was founded by three women. It was ended by the [[Mubarak regime]], but after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|ousting of Mubarak in 2011]], Shayfeencom was re-established by new members.

Shayfeencom's membership is in the tens of thousands, but due to fear of [[political persecution]], they have been discreet when pursuing official figures and have created a privacy policy which does not allow them to share other members' names.

==History==

===Pre-Arab Spring===
Shayfeencom began in 2005, after President [[Hosni Mubarak]] announced that for the first time in 24 years, elections would allow for multiparty participation; this sparked demonstrations by Egyptians who denounced this move as a sham. When the government responded with a violent crackdown, [[Bothaina Kamel]], [[Ghada Shahbandar]], and [[Engi El-Haddad]] formed Shayfeencom.{{sfn|Thornton|Ramzy|2007|loc=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ZcIAh2QRk&amp;feature=player_embedded Introduction]|ps=}}

For the 2005 elections, Shayfeencom armed supporters with video cameras and sent them to [[polling station]]s around the country to monitor the elections and document the political process. Supporters witnessed [[electoral fraud]] and [[voter intimidation]]. When [[Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] candidates made a good showing in the first round of voting, security forces barred voters from entering the polls for the second round. By the third round, voters' frustrations incited violent clashes between protesters and police.{{sfn|Thornton|Ramzy|2007|loc=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMPnSbEwnls&amp;feature=player_embedded# Part 1: Parliamentary Elections]|ps=}}

[[File:Shayfeencomtent-sitin.jpg|thumb|right|Shayfeencom Sit-in for the resignation of the [[Attorney General]] [[Abdel Meguid Mahmoud]]]]

Although discouraged by a [[voter turnout]] of only 30%, the Shayfeencom leaders were heartened by the willingness of two judges to investigate election fraud carried out by eighteen of their colleagues. The judges found evidence of fraud, and Shayfeencom began rallying support for an [[independent judiciary]]. In spite of the prohibition against assemblies of more than five people, crowds gathered outside the [[Egyptian Judges' Club]] to show their support. Many in the crowd were arrested and beaten, including Judge Mahmoud Hamza. The three founders of Shayfeencom produced a short film, aired on [[BBC]], about the plight of the judiciary. They encouraged the public to use all the technology at their disposal—radio, plasma screens, and the Internet—to support the May 25, 2006 "Judges' March for an Independent Judiciary".{{sfn|Thornton|Ramzy|2007|loc=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_QiIlO-W6Q&amp;feature=player_embedded# Part 2: Fraud During Elections]|ps=}}

The march and demonstration resulted in the arrests of thousands of civilians, who remained in prison for months. Though faced by a lack of money and failure to achieve earlier objectives, Shayfeencom continued its work. Co-founder Engi El-Haddad spoke to a group of world leaders (including former president [[George W. Bush]]) at the [[UN]], describing the lack of political freedom in Egypt. In spring of 2007, Shayfeencom mounted a campaign against the government's proposed 34 constitutional amendments that would write parts of the [[Emergency law in Egypt|Emergency Law]] into the Constitution.{{sfn|Thornton|Ramzy|2007|loc=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAK6gdJEw_g&amp;feature=player_embedded Part 3: We Need a Change]|ps=}}

===Post-Arab Spring===
Following the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], Shayfeencom was re-established, with dramatically changed methods. They began preparing for the first Egyptian presidential elections months before it was announced, collecting thousands of volunteers from across Egypt and training them through [[YouTube]] videos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnSEZTYTNcc|medium=video|author=Shayfeencom|script-title=ar:إزاي تزور الإنتخابات|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and online [[seminars]].

Members of the public watched for electoral irregularities and called a hotline to report them. Reports also came in through [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. Alleged violations would immediately appear on Shayfeencom's website; a few minutes later, official monitors would either confirm or deny the reports. Two days into the first phase of Egypt's presidential elections, Shayfeencom received reports of over 1,000 violations throughout the country.

Shayfeencom remains as a [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]], anti-corruption movement.

====Port Said====
Shayfeencom opened its first [[board of trustees]] in [[Port Said]] following the [[Port Said Stadium riot]] in April 2013.

[[Image:PiusXIISaluspopuli.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pope Pius XII.]]
'''''Summi Pontificatus''''' is an [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Pius XII]] published on 20 October 1939.  The encyclical is subtitled "On the Unity of Human Society."&lt;ref&gt;''Summi Pontificatus'', October 20, 1939; AAS 31 (1939) 423 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting "a tone" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as [[ideologies]] of [[racism]], cultural superiority and the [[totalitarian state]]. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' (1943). The encyclical laments the [[invasion of Poland (1939)|destruction of Poland]], denounces the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], and calls for a restoration of independent [[History of Poland|Poland]].

==The Unity of Human Society==
''Summi Pontificatus'' sees [[Christianity]] being universalized and opposed to racial hostility and superiority. There are no racial differences, because the [[human race]] forms a unity, because "one ancestor [Adam] made all nations to inhabit the whole earth".

* What a wonderful vision, which makes us contemplate the human race in the unity of its origin in God. . . in the unity of its nature, composed equally in all men of a material body and a spiritual soul; in the unity of its immediate end and its mission in the world; in the unity of its dwelling, the earth, whose benefits all men, by right of nature, may use to sustain and develop life; in the unity of its supernatural end: God himself, to whom all ought to tend; in the unity of the means for attaining this end;. . . in the unity of the redemption wrought by Christ for all.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

This  divine law of solidarity and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] assures that all men are truly brethren, without excluding the rich variety of persons, cultures and societies.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human and cultural diversity===
''Summi Pontificatus'' teaches, that superior and inferior cultures do not exist and that different levels of development within and between [[nations]] are source for enrichment of the human race. 
*The nations, despite a difference of development due to diverse conditions of life and [[cultural diversity|of culture]], are not destined to break the unity of the human race, but rather to enrich and embellish it by the sharing of their own peculiar gifts and by that reciprocal interchange of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solidarity and charity===
Because of their common origin and their ensuing equality, [[solidarity]] and charity are mandatory for all people. The principle of solidarity,  which can be  articulated in terms of "friendship" or "social charity," is a direct demand of human and Christian brotherhood.

* An error, "today abundantly widespread, is disregard for the law of human solidarity and charity, dictated and imposed both by our common origin and by the equality in rational nature of all men, whatever nation they belong to. This law is sealed by the sacrifice of redemption offered by Jesus Christ on the altar of the Cross to his heavenly Father, on behalf of sinful humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Forgetfulness of the law of universal charity may lead to conflict and war.  Charity alone can create and consolidate peace by extinguishing hatred and softening envies and dissensions in the [[international relations|relations between nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The totalitarian state==
In what most saw as a rejection of totalitarianism, ''Summi Pontificatus'' rejected the idea of the state as "something ultimate to which everything else should be subordinated":

*But there is yet another error no less pernicious to the well-being of the nations and to the prosperity of that great human society which gathers together and embraces within its confines all races. It is the error contained in those ideas which do not hesitate to divorce civil authority from every kind of dependence upon the Supreme Being—First Source and absolute Master of man and of society—and from every restraint of a Higher Law derived from God as from its First Source. Thus they accord the civil authority an unrestricted field of action that is at the mercy of the changeful tide of human will, or of the dictates of casual historical claims, and of the interests of a few."&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===A threat to its families, education===
''Summi Pontificatus'' goes on to show that unlimited state authority is a menace to the prosperity of nations, to the family and to education.

Further, the unlimited authority of the state would present a danger to the primary and essential cell of society, the [[family]], which in a totalitarian system would be viewed from the narrow standpoint of national power. That is contrary to Church teaching, which holds that the family has priority before the state:

*However, and lest it be forgotten that man and the family are by nature anterior to the State, and that the Creator has given to both of them powers and rights and has assigned them a mission and a charge that correspond to undeniable natural requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 61&lt;/ref&gt;

''Summi Pontificatus'' holds that in that case [[education]] would aim at "a one-sided formation of those civic virtues that are considered necessary for attaining political success, while the virtues which give society the fragrance of nobility, humanity and reverence would be inculcated less, for fear they should detract from the pride of the citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 62&lt;/ref&gt; This would "bear most bitter fruits". The encyclical concedes that formation should prepare the youth to fulfill "the offices of a noble patriotism which give to one's earthly fatherland all due measure of love, self-devotion and service", it adds that "a formation which forgot or, worse still, deliberately neglected to direct the eyes and hearts of youth to the heavenly country would be an injustice".&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc''. Summi Pontificatus'', n 67&lt;/ref&gt;

===A danger to World peace===
The principles  of [[natural law|natural]] and [[international law]] are not an option but indispensable, because the totalitarian state is a threat to [[world peace|peace]]:

* The idea which credits the State with unlimited authority is not simply an error harmful to the internal life of nations, to their prosperity, and to the larger and well-ordered increase in their well-being, but likewise it injures the relations between peoples, for it breaks the unity of supra-national society, robs the law of nations of its foundation and vigor, leads to violation of others' rights and impedes agreement and peaceful intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===The German/Russian attack on Poland===
''Summi Pontificatus'', in line with the theological and non-political nature of Papal encyclicals of the past, does not mention explicitly definite names or countries, as many of his accusations against racism, racial segregation superiority and exploitation are far-reaching and of a moral nature. An exception is the fate of [[occupation of Poland|occupied]] [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]. For its specific criticism of the attack and occupation of Poland the encyclical was lauded by the western Allies, and Polish refugees outside Nazi and Soviet control likewise approved of the pope's call for restoration of an independent Polish state.{{cn|date=December 2016}} 

* "The blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants, raises a piteous dirge over a nation such as Our dear Poland, which, for its fidelity to the Church, for its services in the defense of [[Christian civilization]], written in indelible characters in the annals of history, has a right to the generous and brotherly sympathy of the whole world, while it awaits, relying on the powerful intercession of Mary, Help of Christians, the hour of a resurrection in harmony with the principles of justice and true peace."&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
''Summi Pontificatus'' incorporates elements of the draft for an encyclical, ''[[Humani generis unitas]]'', against [[racism]] and anti-semitism, prepared by several [[Jesuits]] for their Father General. [[Pope Pius XI]] was editing and putting the finishing touches on it when he died in February 1939, and his successor, [[Pope Pius XII]], subsequently choose not to publish it, possibly in light of strong [[anti-Judaism|anti-Judaic]] or anti-rabbinic language in parts of it, which could be misunderstood by the faithful or perverted by pro-Axis media.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Passselecp, Berard Suchecky, ''L'Encyclique Cachée De Pii XI'', Paris, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Some 50 years later, this created some controversy, as to whether the new Pope should have published, without changes or additions, the draft of an encyclical letter presented for his predecessor's consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Church practice and [[Canon Law]], did not require publication. The last encyclical that Pius XII was preparing was not issued after his death in 1958 by his successor [[Pope John XXIII]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] incorporated parts of an unpublished last encyclical from [[Pope John Paul II]] in his first letter, ''[[Deus caritas est]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International reactions ===
Contemporaneous reactions to ''Summi Pontificatus'' were strong. While some [[Nazis]] played it down, Von Bergen, the German ambassador to the Vatican, said: "Pope Pius wanted to hit with this encyclical primarily the Third Reich."&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Schmid, Papst Pius Begegnen. Augsburg, 2001, P.80&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] (U.S.) stated that the Gestapo considered the encyclical an attack. The [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] authorities at war with [[Germany]] welcomed it and the French had copies printed and dropped by air over Germany. Germany stopped its printing and distribution and the Gestapo ordered enquiries into people who read or tried to distribute it. ''[[The New York Times]]'' published the encyclical on 28 October 1939 under the headline: "Dictators, Treaty-Breaking and Racism are Condemned by the Pope in his First Encyclical" writing: ''"A powerful attack on totalitarianism and the evils which he considers it has brought upon the world was made by Pope Pius XII in his first encyclical…It is Germany that stands condemned above any country or any movement in this encyclical-the Germany of Hitler and National Socialism."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1939/10/28/113368165.pdf |title=Dictators, Treaty-Breaking and Racism are Condemned by the Pope in his First Encyclical |accessdate=February 11, 2014 |newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 28, 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States|American]] media, without grasping potential implications for domestic race relations, welcomed the decisive positions of the new Pope. More important, devout Catholic that he (Pope Pius XII) was, he knew which side he was for, and unlike Benedict XV during World War I, said so.

It certainly did the Allies no harm when 61,000,000 German and Polish Catholics were told by the leader of their religion that "the idea which credits the State with unlimited authority" was abhorrent to him. "To consider the State as something ultimate to which everything else should be subordinated and directed cannot fail to harm the true and lasting prosperity of nations," read the Encyclical. Again, the Pontiff wrote that the totalitarian system of government was an idea which "robs the law of nations of its foundation and vigor, leads to violation of others' rights and impedes agreement and peaceful intercourse".&lt;ref&gt;''Pius. No dove'', ''Time'' Magazine, November 6, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A conclusion===
The encyclical letter had little or no political impact at the time. But ''Summi Pontificatus'' also predicted an ultimate victory against the enemies of the Church. "Her  adversary can never prevail: The gates of hell shall not prevail, nor can they ever weaken her" &lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Summi Pontificatus'' 104, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologically, the often quoted rationale about the unity of human society and diversity of cultures, is a  part of the Magisterium of the Catholic Church and quoted in numerous Church documents. ''Summi Pontificatus'', despite of its lack of "political success" remains thus one of the more influential theological encyclicals of Pope Pius XII.

{{Nihongo|'''''The Irregular at Magic High School'''''|魔法科高校の劣等生|Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei|{{lit}} "The Poor Performing Student of a Magic High School"}} is a Japanese [[web novel]] series by Tsutomu Satō. It was published on [[Shōsetsuka ni Narō]], an internet web novel website, between October 2008 and March 2011. Satō reached a deal with [[Dengeki Bunko]] and began releasing his work in a [[light novel]] format beginning July 2011. In 2013, each [[story arc]] received a [[manga]] adaptation with varying [[manga artist]]s and publishers. That same year, an [[anime]] adaptation by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] was announced and was broadcast between April and September 2014. ''The Irregular at Magic High School'' franchise had been localized for English by two companies: The light novels and one of the manga adaptations are licensed by [[Yen Press]] while [[Aniplex of America]] licensed the anime series. The anime series was [[simulcast]]ed on four networks, and was later made available on [[Netflix]].

The story takes place in an [[alternate history]] where magic exists and is polished through modern technology. It follows Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, siblings who enroll into First High magic high school. While keeping their connections to the infamous Yotsuba clan secret, they attempt to live their daily life in peace where Tatsuya is shunned for his apparent ineptness and Miyuki is validated for her magical abilities.

The series has been well received. The light novels appeared on Sugoi Japan's 2015 polls and since 2011, is one of the top selling series in Japan with 7.7 million copies sold as of 2017. In addition, its manga and anime adaptations also appeared on top selling charts. English reviewers had mixed to negative reception towards the anime adaptation. The complex technicality of magic within the series was received warmly but the exposition was criticized for being heavy, unclear, and poorly executed.

==Plot==
The series is set in a world with an [[alternate history]], where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence. Following the Third World War, the world's [[superpower]]s shifted to these four nations: The United States of North America (USNA), New Soviet Union, the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the ten master clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited number of magicians, they are treated as a commodity and are forced to enter magic related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.

The story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the leadership of the Yotsuba clan, one of the Ten Master Clans that govern Japan's magicians. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enrolled as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept. However, Tatsuya's technical knowledge, combat abilities, and unique magic techniques cause people to view him as an irregular to the school's standardized rankings.

===Characters===
====Main characters====
;{{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Tatsuya Shiba}}|司波 達也|Shiba Tatsuya}} and {{Nihongo4|{{vanchor|Miyuki Shiba}}|司波 深雪|Shiba Miyuki}}
Tatsuya and Miyuki are siblings of the same school year and children to Tatsurou Shiba and the late Miya Yotsuba;{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} their parents had a loveless [[forced marriage]], and when their mother died, their father married his mistress, Sayuri Furuha, leaving the siblings to live by themselves.{{Ref|LN|LN 6.2}} Maya Yotsuba, their aunt and the current leader of the Yotsuba Clan, was the reason Tatsuya was born with the unique magic to decompose, reconstruct, and detonate matter.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} Out of fear of his powers, the Yotsuba Clan leadership of that time argued for Tatsuya's death, forcing Miya and Maya to take measures to ensure his survival: the first was Miyuki's creation who would act as a seal to Tatsuya's power; the second was to magically dull Tatsuya's emotions except for his familial love towards Miyuki; and the third was to assign Tatsuya to be Miyuki's bodyguard in order to develop his sense of loyalty towards her.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} During a family vacation in Okinawa, Tatsuya warded off an invasion by the Great Asian Alliance and joined the 101 Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion which is headed by [[Major]] Kazama Harunobu.{{Ref|LN|LN 8.7}} At some point during his life Tatsuya developed an interest in engineering magical technology and commercialized revolutionary technology through his family's company, Four Leaves Technology, under the pseudonymous identity Taurus Silver.{{Ref|LN|LN 3.2}} He is voiced by [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Yuichi Nakamura]].&lt;ref name="Staff and Cast"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://mahouka.us/staff/| title=Staff and Cast| publisher=Mahouka.Us| accessdate=October 2, 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929154100/http://mahouka.us/staff/| archivedate=September 29, 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyuki is considered one of the strongest magicians in the world and is a candidate to succeed her Aunt Maya as the leader of the Yotsuba Clan. Her specialty is freezing magic, and her unique magic allows her to freeze a person's consciousness. In addition, half of her magic casting ability is used to seal Tatsuya's powers. Before the family vacation in Okinawa, Miyuki treated Tatsuya coldly akin to how the other Yotsuba Clan members did. She began to warm up to him and when Tatsuya saved her life, she devoted her entire existence to him. It evolved to the point where she disdains the touch of other males and expresses jealousy towards females around Tatsuya.{{Ref|LN|LN 11.15}} Genetically different from Tatsuya despite being born from the same parents, Miyuki professes her love to him following their engagement under Maya's orders.{{Ref|LN|LN 16.6}} She is voiced by [[Saori Hayami]].&lt;ref name="Staff and Cast"/&gt;

In the polls by [[Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!]], both Tatsuya and Miyuki ranked as one of the most popular light novel characters.&lt;ref name="KLNgS 2014"&gt;{{cite book| title=Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi! 2014| publisher=Takarajimasha| isbn=978-4-8002-1954-1| date=November 20, 2013| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the franchise, Tatsuya and Miyuki also appear in ''[[Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax]]''.&lt;ref name="FightingClimax"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-05-09/toradora-taiga-the-irregular-at-magic-high-school-miyuki| title=''Toradora''{{'}}s Taiga, ''The Irregular at Magic High School''{{'}}s Miyuki Join ''Dengeki Bunko Fighting Climax''| date=May 9, 2014| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and conception==
The story was conceived around a protagonist whose abilities cannot be properly measured through standardized evaluation;{{Ref|LN|LN 2.A}} as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba.{{Ref|LN|LN 2.A}} Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene.{{Ref|LN|LN 11.A}} Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.{{Ref|LN|LN 11.A}}

[[Anime News Network]] had four editors review the first episode of the anime:&lt;ref name="ANN Ep1 review"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2014/the-spring-anime/magic| title=The Spring 2014 Anime Preview Guide: ''The Irregular at Magic High School''| date=April 5, 2014| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Kimlinger saw potential in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman felt that it was bland and nothing special. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with "I can't even remember the last time I saw something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all."&lt;ref name="ANN Ep1 review"/&gt; Silverman reviewed the series future episodes.&lt;ref name="ANN anime1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/irregular-at-magic-high-school/sub.blu-ray-1/.90382| title=Blu-Ray 1 - ''Enrollment Arc''| first=Rebecca| last=Silverman| date=July 13, 2015| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN anime2"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school/sub.blu-ray-2/.93065| title=Blu-Ray 2 - ''Nine Schools Competition Arc''| first=Rebecca| last=Silverman| date=September 18, 2015| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]| accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plotwise, she praised the ''Enrollment Arc''{{'}}s underline on standardized testing, criticized the ''Nine Schools Competition Arc'' for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.&lt;ref name="ANN anime2"/&gt;

Chris Beveridge's review for Fandom Post was highly positive towards the anime series, calling it a [[dark horse]] contender as one of their top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events.&lt;ref name="Fandom Post1"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fandompost.com/2015/07/04/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school-set-1-blu-ray-anime-review/| title=''The Irregular at Magic High School'' Set 1 Blu-ray Anime Review| first=Chris| last=Beveridge| date=July 4, 2015| publisher=Fandom Post| accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect.&lt;ref name="Fandom Post2"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fandompost.com/2015/09/16/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school-set-2-blu-ray-anime-review/| title=''The Irregular at Magic High School'' Set 2 Blu-ray Anime Review| first=Chris| last=Beveridge| date=September 16, 2015| publisher=Fandom Post| accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Eisenbeis, writing for [[Kotaku]], liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries.&lt;ref name="Kotaku review"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://kotaku.com/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school-tells-an-entertainin-1653116699| title=''The Irregular at Magic High School'' Tells an Entertaining Story Poorly| first=Richard| last=Eisenbeis| date=October 31, 2014| publisher=[[Kotaku]]| accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been great if a different director or screenwriting was hired.&lt;ref name="Kotaku review"/&gt;

'''Unitarian Universalist Association''' ('''UUA''') is a [[Liberal religion|liberal]] religious association of [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] congregations. It was formed in 1961 by the consolidation of the [[American Unitarian Association]] and the [[Universalist Church of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Divinity School: [http://div.hds.harvard.edu/library/bms/merger_timeline_1900s.html Timeline of Significant Events in the Merger of the Unitarian and Universalist Churches During the 1900s]&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these predecessor organizations began as [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations of the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and [[Christian Universalism|Universalist]] varieties respectively. However, modern Unitarian Universalists see themselves as a separate religion with its own beliefs and affinities. They define themselves as non-[[creed]]al, and draw wisdom from various religions and philosophies, including [[humanism]], [[pantheism]], Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Islam, and [[Modern Paganism|Earth-centered spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh0TY4gig_Q You're a Uni-What?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p03xPbSSSBU Unitarian Universalism - Open Source Faith]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Los Gatos: [http://uuflg.org/ministry-2/rev-fa-jun-minister/ - Our Minister]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the UUA is a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] religious group with liberal leanings.

In the United States, Unitarian Universalism grew by 15.8% between 2000 and 2010 to include 211,000 adherents nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smietana|first1=Bob|title=Unitarian faith growing nationwide|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/01/unitarian-faith-growing-stronger-nationwide/1607243/|website=usatoday.com|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=February 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congregations==
[[Image:UnitarianUniversalistChurchsignRochesterMN.JPG|thumb|left|Sign on a UU church in [[Rochester, Minnesota]], United States.]]
Most of the member congregations of the UUA are in the United States and Canada, but the UUA has also admitted congregations from Australia, New Zealand, the [[Philippines]] and [[Pakistan]] (although UUA policy appears at present to be against admitting any new congregations from outside North America, rather having them form their own national bodies and having these bodies join the [[International Council of Unitarians and Universalists]]{{Original research inline|date=September 2010}}). Until 2002, almost all member congregations of the [[Canadian Unitarian Council]] (CUC) were also members of the UUA and most services to CUC member congregations were provided by the UUA. However, after an agreement between the UUA and the CUC, since 2002 most services have been provided by the CUC to its own member congregations, with the UUA continuing to provide ministerial settlement services. Since 2002, some Canadian congregations have continued to be members of both the UUA and CUC while others are members of only the CUC.

The [[Church of the Larger Fellowship]] (CLF) is a member church of the Unitarian Universalist Association providing denominational services to persons unable to attend a physical congregation because of distance or mobility, or who wish to belong to a congregation other than their local congregation. Many of these are Unitarian Universalists in other countries, members of the military, prisoners or non-mobile elderly.

==Organization==
[[Image:UUA_Logo.svg|thumb|right|Old UUA logo]]
The Unitarian Universalist Association is headquartered at 24 Farnsworth Street, within [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. This serves as the historical center of Unitarianism in the U.S. As of 2009, the UUA comprised 19 [[Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association|Districts]], 1,041 congregations with 164,656 certified members and 61,795 church school enrollees served by 1,623 ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uua.org/aboutuua/statistics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 10, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603121718/http://www.uua.org/aboutuua/statistics.html |archivedate=June 3, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2011 the UUA had 162,796 certified members and 54,671 church school enrollees. This shows a decline of 1,860 members and 7,124 enrollees in church school since 2008. The UUA has, for the first time, also reported decline in average weekly attendance to 100,693 people. This is a drop of 1.5% on the 2010 reported figure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uuworld.org/news/articles/183612.shtml|title=UUA membership declines again|author=|date=23 May 2011|website=uuworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many atheists and humanists are also a part of the various congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Dan|title='Are You with the Atheists?'|url=http://www.uuworld.org/2003/01/feature3.html|publisher=UU World|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate status===
The UUA was given corporate status in May 1961 under special acts of legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of New York. See Chapter 148 of the acts of 1960 of the Massachusetts legislature and Chapter 827 of the Acts of 1960 of the New York legislature. Copies of said acts are attached to the minutes of the organizing meeting of the association held in Boston, Massachusetts, in May 1961 and also are printed in the 1961–62 directory of the association.

===Decentralized association===
The UUA is not a [[religious denomination|denomination]] in the traditional sense; the UUA is an [[Voluntary association|association]] of congregations with no one organization able to speak authoritatively for the whole. It is the congregations that have authority over the larger body, through the annual General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association. Since the general public understands ''denomination'' much more readily than ''association of congregations'', the distinction is generally omitted in conversation. Because of this relationship between the congregations and the association, [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] congregations have a [[congregationalist polity]] of governance. However, day-to-day decisions are made by the president, the moderator, and the Board of Trustees.

In its role as a national organization representing the congregations, the UUA is a member of various organizations, both religious and secular.

===Principles and purposes===
The UUA does not have a central creed in which members are required to believe, but they have found it useful to articulate their common values in what has become known as the ''Principles and Purposes''. The first version of the principles was adopted in 1960, and the modern form was adopted in 1984 (including the 7th principle).  They were amended once again in 1995 to include the 6th source.  Both of these were added to explicitly include members with [[Neopagan]], Native American, and other natural theist spiritualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/3643.shtml?lj|title=How the UU Principles and Purposes were adopted|author=|date=1 May 2006|website=uuworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles as published in church literature and [http://www.uua.org/aboutuua/principles.html on the UUA website] :

:'''The principles and purposes of the Unitarian Universalist Association'''

:''"We, the member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association, covenant to affirm and promote"''
:*The inherent worth and dignity of every person;
:*Justice, equity and compassion in human relations;
:*Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations;
:*A free and responsible search for truth and meaning;
:*The right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within our congregations and in society at large;
:*The goal of world community with peace, liberty, and justice for all;
:*Respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part.

:''"The living tradition which we share draws from many sources:"''
:*Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life;
:*Words and deeds of prophetic people which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love;
:*Wisdom from the world's religions which inspires us in our ethical and spiritual life;
:*Jewish and Christian teachings which call us to respond to God's love by loving our neighbors as ourselves;
:*Humanist teachings which counsel us to heed the guidance of [[reason]] and the results of science, and warn us against idolatries of the mind and spirit.
:*Spiritual teachings of earth-centered traditions which celebrate the sacred circle of life and instruct us to live in harmony with the rhythms of nature.

:''"Grateful for the religious pluralism which enriches and ennobles our faith, we are inspired to deepen our understanding and expand our vision. As free congregations we enter into this covenant, promising to one another our mutual trust and support."''

:'''The purposes of the Unitarian Universalist Association'''

:The Unitarian Universalist Association shall devote its resources to and exercise its corporate powers for religious, educational and humanitarian purposes. The primary purpose of the Association is to serve the needs of its member congregations, organize new congregations, extend and strengthen Unitarian Universalist institutions and implement its principles.

:The Association declares and affirms its special responsibility, and that of its member societies and organizations, to promote the full participation of persons in all of its and their activities and in the full range of human endeavor without regard to race, color, sex, disability, affectional or sexual orientation, age, or national origin and without requiring adherence to any particular interpretation of religion or to any particular religious belief or creed.

:Nothing herein shall be deemed to infringe upon the individual freedom of belief which is inherent in the Universalist and Unitarian heritages or to conflict with any statement of purpose, covenant, or bond of union used by any society unless such is used as a creedal test.

===General Assembly===
{{Main|General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)}}
General Assembly ([http://www.uua.org/ga/ GA]) is held every year in June in a different city in the USA. Member congregations (and three associate member organizations) send delegates and conventioneers to participate in the [[plenary session]]s, workshops, district gatherings, and worship services.

===Finances and membership fees===
The UUA requests annual contributions from its member congregations.  The requested contribution, known as Fair Share, is calculated for each congregation by multiplying an annually determined membership fee times the number of registered members of that congregation.   The UUA also has alternative modes of raising funds.  In order for congregations to participate in certain programming, they will pay a nominal fee.  Some funds are earned through charitable gifts or estate planning.  Additionally, the UUA pools together investment funds from congregations or other constituents and manages them for a small percentage.

===Alternate growth strategies===
UUA leaders concerned with membership numbers fluctuating from barely perceptible growth to slight decline, are working with a variety of experimental UU communities that represent alternative models of congregational formation—or that may point to new forms of affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related organizations==
Two non-congregational organizations belong to the UUA as Associate Member organizations. Associate Member organizations are esteemed as inherently integral to the work of the UUA and its member congregations, and are accorded two voting delegates each to the annual General Assembly. The Associate Member organizations are the [[Unitarian Universalist Service Committee]] (UUSC), which is active in social change actions, and the [http://www.uuwf.org Unitarian Universalist Women's Federation], which provides education and advocacy on women's issues.  The Unitarian Universalist United Nations Office, which is a center of information and action at the [[United Nations]], was an Associate Member organization until it became an office within the UUA in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greer|first1=Jane|title=UU United Nations Office to rejoin UUA|url=http://www.uuworld.org/articles/uuuno-rejoins-uua|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=UUWorld.org|date=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UUA also recognizes many organizations as Independent Affiliate organizations. These organizations are created by Unitarian Universalists as needed to meet the special needs of the diversity within Unitarian Universalism. These groups may provide specialized spiritual support, work for specific [[social justice]] issues, provide support for religious professionals, etc.

The UUA owns [[Beacon Press]], a nationally known publisher of both fiction and non-fiction books. [[Skinner House Books]] publishes books primarily of interest to Unitarian Universalists.

The UUA also participates in interfaith organizations such as the [[Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility]].

==Governance==
The UUA is governed by delegates elected to the annual [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|General Assembly]].  GA delegates elect the president, the moderator, and members of the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bylaws and Rules |url=https://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/bylaws |website=UUA.org |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From when the association was established in 1961 until 2010, the president and moderator were each elected to four-year terms by delegates at General Assembly. An individual could not be elected to more than two successive terms.  Candidates ran by petition. The 2010 General Assembly adopted a bylaw amendment, to take effect in stages beginning in 2013, making changes in the composition of the Board of Trustees and in the terms and election procedures for president and moderator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greer|first1=Jane|title=General Assembly focuses UUA on immigration|url=http://www.uuworld.org/articles/ga-focuse-uua-immigration|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=UUWorld.org|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of the Forty-Ninth General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association|url=http://www.uua.org/sites/live-new.uua.org/files/documents/ga/100627_minutes.pdf|website=UUA|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the new system, the president and moderator are each limited to a single term of six years.  A Presidential Search Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presidential Search Committee|url=http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/committees/psc|website=UUA|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; nominates candidates for president.  The Board of Trustees nominates candidates for moderator.  Individuals who are not nominated by the committee or the board may run by petition.  The 2010 amendment also reduced the size of the Board of Trustees and changed the election process so that all trustees are elected by General Assembly.  (The prior board consisted of one trustee elected by each [[Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association|UUA district]] and several at-large trustees elected by General Assembly.)

===President===
The president of the UUA is its [[CEO]] and the religious leader of Unitarian Universalism in the United States. The current UUA president is Rev. Susan Frederick-Gray, who was elected at the 2017 [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|UUA General Assembly]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]; she will be the first president to serve a single six-year term, per a 2010 bylaw change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Walton |first1=Christopher |date=30 March 2017 |title=UUA President Peter Morales resigns amid controversy over hiring practices |url=http://www.uuworld.org/articles/peter-morales-resigns |work=[[UU World]] |accessdate=25 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick-Gray is the first woman to be elected as president of the UUA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ulbrich |first=Holley |date=March 26, 2017 |title=UUA President: Year of the Woman |url=http://uufranklin.org/uua-president-year-woman |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Franklin, NC |accessdate=25 June 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderator===
The moderator of the UUA is the [[chairman|chair]] of the Board of Trustees and is the presiding officer at [[General Assembly (Unitarian Universalist Association)|General Assembly]]. The moderator is the highest UUA position traditionally held by [[laity]].

Moderator Jim Key was elected for a six-year term at General Assembly in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Deakin |first1=Michelle Bates |date=24 June 2013 |title=Jim Key wins moderator election in close contest |url=http://www.uuworld.org/articles/key-wins-moderator-close-contest |work=[[UU World]] |accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boy Scouts of America controversy==
{{Further2|[[Boy Scouts of America]] membership controversies and [[Religious emblems programs (Boy Scouts of America)]]}}

The Religion in Life [[Religious emblems programs|religious emblems program]] of UUA is no longer recognized by the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA). The UUA published statements opposing the BSA's policies on [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies#Position on homosexuals|homosexuals]], [[Boy Scouts of America membership controversies#Position on atheists and agnostics|atheists, and agnostics]] in 1992; and in 1993, the UUA updated Religion in Life to include criticism of these BSA policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.uua.org/news/scouts/faith.html |title=The Boy Scouts, a Battle and the Meaning of Faith |accessdate=2007-05-09 |author=Gustav Niebuhr |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=1999-05-22 |work= |publisher=New York Times |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212065426/http://archive.uua.org/news/scouts/faith.html |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |quote= |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the BSA withdrew recognition of Religion in Life, stating that such information was incompatible with BSA programs.

===Alternative UU-friendly scouting organizations===
In the wake of this controversy, a number of [[SpiralScouts International]] circles and dozens of [[Navigators USA]] Chapters have formed within congregations of the UUA, despite having no official affiliation with the UUA.&lt;ref name="uuworld.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uuworld.org/news/articles/45487.shtml|title=Scouting alternatives draw UU youth|author=|date=21 September 2007|website=uuworld.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Navigators USA,&lt;ref name="uuworld.org"/&gt; was founded by volunteers of All Souls Unitarian Church in New York City after terminating its charter with Boy Scout Troop 103 because of the BSA policies.  Its founders describe as "...committed to providing a quality scouting experience that is inclusive and available to all children and families regardless of gender, race, religion, economic status, sexual orientation and social background."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navigatorsusa.org|title=Navigators USA - Alternative Youth Scouting|author=|date=|website=www.navigatorsusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 120 chapters in the United States, plus  a number in the UK, France, and Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;[http://navigatorsusa.ning.com/page/startachapter-1 START-A-CHAPTER - Navigators USA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211130522/http://navigatorsusa.ning.com/page/startachapter-1 |date=December 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to SpiralScouts and Navigators USA, the UUA website also suggests [[Camp Fire (organization)|Camp Fire]] as an alternative scout-like organization that comports with UU principles.

{{Politics of Namibia}}

The '''Vice-President of Namibia''' is the acting President of [[Namibia]] when the [[President of Namibia|President]] is outside the country's borders, unable to fulfill the duties of the office, or when the Presidency is vacant. The Vice-President is also a member of the [[National Assembly (Namibia)|National Assembly]] and the [[Cabinet of Namibia|Cabinet]]. The Vice-President is [[Constitution of Namibia|constitutionally]] required to 'assist the President in the execution of the functions of government,' and may be assigned any government portfolio by presidential proclamation. 

The position of Vice-President was established in 2014 along with several other constitutional amendments. The position is controversial due to its unclear portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=VP post ‘unnecessary’ - analysts | last=Angula | first=Sonja | newspaper=[[Windhoek Observer]] | date=21 July 2016 | url=http://www.observer.com.na/index.php/national/6600-vp-post-unnecessary-analysts}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nickey Iyambo]] served as the first Vice-President of Namibia from 2015 to 2018. The current Vice-President, appointed by President [[Hage Geingob]] is [[Nangolo Mbumba]].

The '''Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone''' was a [[demilitarized zone]] established as a dividing line between [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] as a result of the [[First Indochina War]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], it became important as the battleground demarcation separating North from South Vietnamese territories.

The zone ceased to exist with the [[reunification of Vietnam]], though the area remains dangerous due to the numerous undetonated explosives it contains.

==Geography==

The Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone ran from east-west near the center of present-day Vietnam (spanning more than a hundred kilometers) and was a couple of kilometers wide, about a hundred kilometers north of the city of [[Huế]].  It ran along the [[Ben Hai River]] for much of its length, and an island nearby was controlled by North Vietnamese forces during the Vietnam War. Although it was nominally described as being at "the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]]," almost all of the zone lies to the south of the parallel, with only a small portion of the zone near the eastern end actually including the parallel.

==The First Indochina War==
{{main article|First Indochina War}}

The First Indochina War (also called the French Indochina War) was fought in [[French Indochina]] from 1946 through 1954 between [[France]] and the French-controlled [[State of Vietnam]] on the one side, and the [[Communism|Communist-dominated]] independence movement, the [[Viet Minh]], on the other. The Viet Minh won the war, gaining effective control of all northern Vietnam except an enclave around [[Hanoi]].

In 1954, France gave up its control of Vietnam, and the Viet Minh was recognized as the government of northern Vietnam.

==Establishing the DMZ==
The post-colonial conditions of Vietnam were set at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954; the agreement was finalized on July 21, 1954.

[[File:DMZ March, 1968.jpg|thumb|300px|The Demilitarized Zone between North and South Vietnam, March, 1968, looking west toward Laos.]]
The Geneva agreement reflected the military results at that time. The northern part of Vietnam, which was almost entirely controlled by the Viet Minh became the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], under [[Communist]] leader [[Ho Chi Minh]]. The southern part of Vietnam, where the Viet Minh controlled relatively small and remote areas, became the independent State of Vietnam under [[Bảo Đại]], the last scion of the old Vietnamese imperial house. The State of Vietnam later became the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]].

The boundary between these two zones was established at the [[Ben Hai River]], which enters the [[South China Sea]] at 17 degrees 0 minutes 54 seconds N latitude. The boundary followed the Ben Hai to its headwaters, about 55&amp;nbsp;km WSW, and thence to the [[Laos|Laotian]] border.

The area within 5&amp;nbsp;km on either side of the border was declared to be a demilitarized zone. Troops of both governments were barred from this area.  3rd Marine Division intelligence estimated the combat strength of NVA and VC forces in the DMZ area in January 1968 was 40,943 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Pike, COL Thomas F., Military Records, February 1968, 3rd Marine Division: The Tet Offensive, p. 115, {{ISBN|978-1-481219-46-4}}. NVA and VC Order of Battle information is located on pages 114-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Exploring the Demilitarized Zone can today be comfortably achieved by joining one of various organised tours starting daily from [[Hué]]. Together with a local guide the most famous war settings, as [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]], [[The Rockpile]], Ho-Chi-Minh-Trail, Doc-Mieu-Station or the [[Vinh Moc tunnels]] are visited on a full-day trip.

Although the Vietnam War ended decades ago, walking outside marked tracks can still be dangerous because of numerous unexploded ordnance devices.&lt;ref name="lonely-planet"&gt;Lonely Planet, {{ISBN|978-3-8297-1595-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
