The '''amendments of 2008''', which were proposed in November 2008 and came into force on 31 December 2008, are the first substantial amendments to the [[Constitution of Russia]] of 1993&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3392827/Vladimir-Putin-could-reclaim-Russian-presidency-within-months.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Adrian | last=Blomfield | title=Vladimir Putin could reclaim Russian presidency within months | date=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;David Nowak.

Earlier only minor adjustments concerning the naming of the [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]] or their merging were made, which require a much simpler procedure.

==History==
[[Image:Dmitry Medvedev 5 November 2008-5.jpg|thumb|300px|Dmitry Medvedev delivering his [[State of the Nation (Russia)|Annual Address]] to the Federal Assembly]]
President [[Dmitry Medvedev]], who succeeded [[Vladimir Putin]] earlier that year, made that brief proposal during his first [[State of the Nation (Russia)|annual address]] to the [[Federal Assembly of Russia|Federal Assembly]] on 5 November 2008:&lt;ref&gt;Steve Gutterman and Vladimir Isachenkov.

{{Quote|[W]e should increase the constitutional mandates of the President and State Duma to six and five years respectively.

These issues have been raised repeatedly since the 1990s. Discussions on these subjects have gone on for a long time. Many have made reference to history, which abounds with examples of democratic countries changing the terms and mandates of their state bodies.

I will not list all of these examples. These cases are well known. What I want to say is that we are not talking about constitutional reform but about adjustments to the Constitution, about adjustments that are important but are nonetheless no more than clarifications and do not change the political and legal essence of the current institutions. These adjustments provide rather an additional resource for the institutions' stable work. There is no place for a 'reforming itch' with regard to the Constitution. The Constitution is effective, it works, and its basic provisions should remain unchanged for many years to come. Civic rights and freedoms, the nation’s sovereignty, the state system and federal organisation, the organisation principles of the judicial system and local self-government, and the other foundations of our constitutional order have been set for a long-term historical period. As the guarantor of the Constitution, I will preserve and protect these fundamental provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitry Medvedev.

According to the articles 136 and 108, amendments to the provisions of Chapters 3–8, including the articles 81 and 96, require the same approval as a federal constitutional law, that is, a two-thirds [[supermajority]] vote in the [[State Duma]], the [[lower house]] and a three-fourths [[supermajority]] vote in the [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], the [[upper house]], and come into force as they have passed the [[Regional parliaments of Russia|Regional legislatures]] of no less than two thirds of the 83 [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]].

[[Yulia Latynina]], journalist for ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', speculated that the reform prefigures Vladimir Putin's return to the Kremlin, probably earlier than in May 2012, when Medvedev's term is set to expire. An unnamed official from the [[Russian presidential administration|Presidential Executive Office]] cited by ''[[Vedomosti]]'' hinted that Medvedev could resign as early as in 2009.&lt;ref name="telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yulia Latynina.

The support, however, was lower in big cities.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p-13623/r_500/Presidential_term_extension/ Half of Russians Support Extension of Presidential Term] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107132742/http://www.kommersant.com/p-13623/r_500/Presidential_term_extension/ |date=7 January 2009 }}, ''[[Kommersant]]'', 21 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wciom.ru/novosti/press-vypuski/press-vypusk/single/11022.html Поправки в Конституцию: две трети россиян – за!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618154759/http://wciom.ru/novosti/press-vypuski/press-vypusk/single/11022.html |date=18 June 2009 }}.

By 18 December the [[Regional parliaments of Russia|provincial legislatures]] of all 83 [[federal subjects of Russia]] had approved the amendments. The Federation Council reviewed and accepted the approvals on 22 December and on 30 December President Medvedev [[Sign into law#Approval|signed them into law]]. The amendments were published in ''[[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]'' and hence came into force on 31 December 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3557">The '''American Bar Association Model Code of Professional Responsibility''', created by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) in 1969, was a set of professional standards designed to establish the minimum baseline of [[legal ethics]] and [[professional responsibility]] generally required of lawyers in the [[United States]].

It was replaced with the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] in 1983 for a number of reasons, especially the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Schneyer, "Professionalism as Politics: The Making of a Modern Legal Ethics Code," in ''Lawyers' Ideals/Lawyers' Practices: Transformations in the American Legal Profession'', eds. Robert L. Nelson, David M. Trubek, &amp; Rayman L. Solomon, 95–143 (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1992), 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was also subject to widespread criticism from bench and bar that it was structurally flawed, difficult to understand, hard to obey, and impossible to enforce.  The Code consisted of Canons, Ethical Considerations, and Disciplinary Rules, of which the first two were aspirational and only the third was mandatory. This forced judges and lawyers to sort through a maze of Canons and Ethical Considerations just to understand the Disciplinary Rule that controlled a particular ethical issue. During a key debate in late January 1982 over whether to replace the Model Code with the Model Rules, one delegate "referred to the nine canons, 129 ethical considerations and forty-three disciplinary rules as a [[three-dimensional chess]] game that lawyers played at their own peril."&lt;ref&gt;Center for Professional Responsibility, ''A Legislative History: The Development of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, 1982-2005'' (Chicago: American Bar Association, 2006), xiii-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; The American legal community demanded simple [[bright-line rule]]s that its members could quickly read, comprehend, and follow. In response, the Model Rules consists simply of Rules.

According to the Code's Preface, it was derived from the ABA's Canons of Professional Ethics (1908), which in turn were borrowed from the Canons of the Alabama State Bar (1887), which in turn were inspired by several sources such as ethics resolutions in an 1830s legal textbook.

The [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] was the last state using the Code for many years, long after all other states–except California and Maine–had adopted the Model Rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/press/pr2008_7.shtml Press Release: New Attorney Rules of Professional Conduct Announced], Communications Office of the New York Courts, 17 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 2008, the administrative committee of the New York courts announced that it had adopted a heavily modified version of the Model Rules, effective April 1, 2009. New York's version of the Model Rules was created by adjusting the standard Model Rules to reflect indigenous New York rules that had been incorporated over the years into its version of the Model Code. Even though New York did not adopt the Model Rules verbatim, the advantage of adopting its overall structure is that it simplifies the professional responsibility training of New York lawyers, and makes it easier for out-of-state lawyers to conform their conduct to New York rules by simply comparing their home state's version of the Model Rules to New York's version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15184">The '''Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act''' ('''ACPA'''), 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d), is a U.S. law enacted in 1999 that established a cause of action for registering, trafficking in, or using a [[domain name]] confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, a [[trademark]] or personal name.&lt;ref&gt;Jane C. Ginsberg, ''Trademark and Unfair Competition Law'' 748 (Robert C. Clark et al. eds., Foundation Press 4th ed. 2007)(2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybertelecom.org/dns/acpa.htm Cybertelecom :: Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act] Providing Legislative History, Caselaw, and References&lt;/ref&gt; The law was designed to thwart [[Cybersquatting|“cybersquatters”]] who register Internet domain names containing trademarks with no intention of creating a legitimate web site, but instead plan to sell the domain name to the trademark owner or a third party.&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"&gt;2-7A Gilson on Trademarks &amp;sect;7A.06, Trademark Cyberpiracy and Cybersquatting (Matthew Bender &amp; Co. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the ACPA complain about the non-global scope of the Act and its potential to restrict free speech,&lt;ref&gt;Serena C. Hunn, ''Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act: A Powerful Remedy in Domain Name Disputes? Or a Threat to Electronic Commerce?'', [http://www.fmew.com/archive/cybersquat/index.html http://www.fmew.com/archive/cybersquat/index.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others dispute these complaints. Before the ACPA was enacted, trademark owners relied heavily on the [[Federal Trademark Dilution Act]] (FTDA) to sue domain name registrants.&lt;ref&gt;2-7A Gilson on Trademarks &amp;sect;7A.07, Domain Name Dilution (Matthew Bender &amp; Co. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The FTDA was enacted in 1995 in part with the intent to curb domain name abuses.&lt;ref&gt;Panavision Int&amp;rsquo;l L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1326 (9th Cir. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The legislative history of the FTDA specifically mentions that trademark dilution in domain names was a matter of Congressional concern motivating the Act.&lt;ref name="Panavision Int 1316"&gt;Panavision Int&amp;rsquo;l L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1326 (9th Cir. 1998); TeleTech Customer Care Mgmt., Inc. v. Tele-Tech Co., 977 F. Supp. 1407, 1413 (C.D. Cal. 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Leahy stated that “it is my hope that this anti-dilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others”.&lt;ref name="Panavision Int 1316"/&gt;

For example, in ''Panavision Int’l L.P. v. Toeppen'', 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998), [[Dennis Toeppen]] registered the domain name Panavision.com. Panavision, the trademark owner, learned that Toeppen had registered its trademark when it attempted to register the trademark “Panavision” as a domain name.&lt;ref&gt;Panavision Int&amp;rsquo;l L.P. v. Toeppen, 141 F.3d 1316, 1319 (9th Cir. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Toeppen was using the domain panavision.com to display photographs of [[Pana, Illinois|Pana]], Illinois, and, when asked to cease, he offered to sell the domain name to Panavision for $13,000.&lt;ref name="Panavision Int 1316"/&gt; After Panavision refused to buy the domain name from Toeppen, he registered its other trademark, Panaflex, as a domain name.&lt;ref name="Panavision Int 1316"/&gt; The Court held that the FTDA could be violated without the traditional tarnishing or blurring the courts had required.&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"/&gt; Rulings like this extended the FTDA substantially.

==Overview==
Under the ACPA, a trademark owner may bring a [[cause of action]] against a domain name registrant who
* Has a bad faith intent to profit from the mark
* Registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that is
** Identical or confusingly similar to a distinctive mark
** Identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of a famous mark
** Is a trademark protected by 18 U.S.C. § 706 (marks involving the Red Cross) or 36 U.S.C. § 220506 (marks related to the “Olympics”)&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1125(d)(1)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;
A trademark is famous if the owner can prove that the mark “is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source of the goods or services of the mark's owner”.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1125(c)(2)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;

“Trafficking” in the context of domain names includes, but is not limited to “sales, purchases, loans, pledges, licenses, exchanges of currency, and any other transfer for consideration or receipt in exchange for consideration”.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1125(d)(1)(E)&lt;/ref&gt; The ACPA also requires that the mark be distinctive or famous at the time of registration.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt;

In determining whether the domain name registrant has a bad faith intent to profit, a court may consider many factors, including nine that are outlined in the statute:
# Registrant’s trademark or other intellectual property rights in the domain name; 
# Whether the domain name contains the registrant’s legal or common name;
# Registrant’s prior use of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods or services;
# Registrant’s bona fide noncommercial or fair use of the mark in a site accessible by the domain name;
# Registrant’s intent to divert customers from the mark owner’s online location that could harm the [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] represented by the mark, for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark;
# Registrant’s offer to transfer, sell, or otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or a third party for financial gain, without having used the mark in a legitimate site;
# Registrant’s providing misleading false contact information when applying for registration of the domain name;
# Registrant’s registration or acquisition of multiple domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to marks of others; and

The ACPA does not prevent the fair use of trademarks or any use protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which includes [[gripe site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1125(d)(1)(B)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince'', 314 F. Supp. 2d 362 (D.N.J 2004), the court found that the first two prongs of Mayflower's ACPA claim were easily met because (1) their registered trademark was distinctive and (2) Defendant’s “mayflowervanline.com” was confusingly similar to Plaintiff’s Mayflower trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362, 367 (D.N.J 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the court was examining the third prong of Plaintiff’s ACPA claim, whether Defendant registered its domain name with the bad faith intent to profit from Plaintiff, the court found Defendant had a bona fide noncommercial use of the mark, therefore, the ACPA claim failed.&lt;ref&gt;Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362, 367, 369 (D.N.J 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; “Defendant’s motive for registering the disputed domain names was to express his customer dissatisfaction through the medium of the Internet.”&lt;ref&gt;Mayflower Transit, L.L.C. v. Prince, 314 F. Supp. 2d 362, 369 (D.N.J 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[domain name registrar]] or registry or other domain name authority is not liable for [[injunction|injunctive]] or monetary relief except in the case of bad faith or reckless disregard.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1125(d)(2)(D)(ii)&lt;/ref&gt;

While § 1125 protects trademark owners, 15 U.S.C. § 1129 protects any living person from having their personal name included in a domain name, but only when the domain name is registered for profitable resale.&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1129(1)(A) (transferred to 15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 8131)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals caused a stir in 2013 when it held, in ''Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) v. GoDaddy.com'',  737 F.3d 546 (9th Cir. 2013), petition for cert. filed, 2014 WL 1510251 (U.S. Apr. 14, 2014), that  there is no cause of action for contributory cybersquatting, i.e. [[secondary liability]] under the ACPA.  It so held notwithstanding the extensive body of case law permitting such liability where a registrar is shown to have acted outside the normal ministerial bounds of domain registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |title=Ninth Circuit Holds There is No Cause of Action for Contributory Cybersquatting
 |work=secondarytrademarkinfringement.com/
 |accessdate=Oct 1, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
It also relied on ''[[Central Bank of Denver v. First Interstate Bank of Denver]]'' and premised on the Circuit Court's determination that the ACPA is not part of the Lanham Act and therefore not included in the rule permitting secondary liability for trademark infringement enunciated in ''Inwood Labs v. Ives Labs'', 456 U.S. 844 (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=Oct 1, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''In rem'' jurisdiction==
The ACPA also provides that the trademark owner can file an ''[[in rem]]'' action against the domain name in the judicial district where the domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name authority registered or assigned the domain name is located if:&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. &amp;sect; 1125(d)(2)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;
*(1) the domain name violates any right of the trademark owner and
*(2) the court finds that the owner
**(a) is not able to obtain ''[[in personam]]'' jurisdiction over the person who would have been a defendant under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1); or
**(b) through [[due diligence]] was not able to find a person who would have been a defendant under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1) by sending a notice of the alleged violation and publishing notice of the action.

This provision is rarely used, however, because many trademark owners can achieve the same results through a [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy]]  (UDRP) proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. Retrieved from http://www.icann.org/en/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACPA v. UDRP==
Instead of suing in federal court under the ACPA, a trademark owner can choose to pursue an administrative proceeding under ICANN's [[Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]] (UDRP).  The UDRP allows a trademark owner to challenge domain name registrations in expedited administrative proceedings.&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"/&gt;

A UDRP proceeding can be faster and cheaper for trademark owners than an ACPA lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"/&gt; Also, UDRP outcomes tend to be pro-plaintiff because many UDRP arbitrators are trademark lawyers.&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"/&gt; However, some trademark owners prefer to bring ACPA claims because they offer more remedies than the cancellation or transfer of the domain name (the only remedies available under UDRP proceedings)&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"/&gt; and a court ruling can lead to a final resolution of the matter.&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"/&gt; Also, a suit under the ACPA may deter future cybersquatters more effectively than a UDRP proceeding.&lt;ref name="Trademarks 2009"/&gt;

==Domaining and the ACPA==
While the ACPA contemplated the purchase of domain names for resale to trademark owners, it did not contemplate the more modern practice of [[domaining]]. Domaining is the business of registering a domain name and [[domain parking|parking it]] or placing [[pay-per-click]] ads on it. Domainers rely on [[type-in traffic]], which is when Internet surfers type in the domain name rather than using a [[search engine]].&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"&gt;Paul Sloan, ''Masters of their Domains'', [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/12/01/8364591/ http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/12/01/8364591/]&lt;/ref&gt; Domainers can make a lot of money by buying and selling domain names.&lt;ref name="money.cnn.com"/&gt;

Some domainers relied on [[domain tasting]], which involves placing pay-per-click ads on the domain for five days (or less) to determine whether the ads will make more than the annual cost of the domain.&lt;ref name="public.icann.org"&gt;ICANN Issues: Domain name tasting, [http://public.icann.org/issues/domain-name-tasting http://public.icann.org/issues/domain-name-tasting]&lt;/ref&gt; If the domain is dropped within the five-day grace period, no fee is incurred.&lt;ref name="public.icann.org"/&gt; An industry has grown up out of this business with domainers taking part in these mass registrations.&lt;ref name="public.icann.org"/&gt; This practice was largely eliminated by 2009, when [[ICANN]] began raising fees to registrars with excessive domain tasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-12aug09-en.htm |title=The End of Domain Tasting &amp;#124; AGP Deletes Decrease 99.7% |publisher=ICANN |date=2009-08-12 |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems'', 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2008), the domainer lost under the ACPA.&lt;ref&gt;Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088 (C.D. Cal. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the defendants, Basic Fusion, Inc. argued that they were not cybersquatters, but as an Internet registrar accredited by ICANN they could register domain names on behalf of its customers and it specialized in "bulk registration".&lt;ref name="Verizon California 1088"&gt;Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1092 (C.D. Cal. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Navigation Catalyst Systems]], another defendant and a customer of Basic Fusion, used their "proprietary automated tool" to find domain names that were not already registered and then registered them using Basic Fusion.&lt;ref name="Verizon California 1088"/&gt; Navigation used the five days following the registration (the "advertisement grace period") to put advertisements on the websites making money from the advertisements even when they dropped the domain name registration before the five-day window closed.&lt;ref&gt;Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1092-93 (C.D. Cal. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiff Verizon argued that defendants "registered" 1,392 domain names that were confusingly similar to plaintiff's trademarks.&lt;ref name="Verizon California 1088"/&gt; The Court found that defendants used the confusingly similar domain names with a bad faith intent to profit.&lt;ref&gt;Verizon California, Inc. v. Navigation Catalyst Systems, Inc., 568 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1094-97 (C.D. Cal. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">The '''Arbitration Fairness Act of 2011''' is a proposed law in the [[US Congress]] to reverse the effects of ''[[14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett]]''&lt;ref&gt;556 U.S. 247 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[AT&amp;T Mobility v. Concepcion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;563 U.S. 333 (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Both judgments held, 5 judges to 4 dissenting justices, that employees and consumers were not entitled to claim for rights in public courts if they had agreed to arbitration in a collective or individual agreement. The result has been negation of statutory rights by contract.

==Background==
The Bill was introduced in May 2011 by Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] (D-CT), [[Al Franken]] (D-MN) and 11 Senate co-sponsors. A companion bill was introduced in the House of Representatives [http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.php/ &amp;#91;H.R. 1873&amp;#93;] by [[Hank Johnson|Representative Henry “Hank” Johnson]] [D-GA]  The bill, first introduced to Congress in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;“Sens. Franken, Blumenthal, Rep. Hank Johnson Announce Legislation Giving Consumers More Power in the Courts against Corporations,” Press Release from Wednesday, April 27, 2011, http://blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sens-franken-blumenthal-rep-hank-johnson-announce-legislation-giving-consumers-more-power-in-the-courts-against-corporations&lt;/ref&gt; leaves arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements between employers and labor unions unaffected “except that no such arbitration provision shall have the effect of waiving the right of an employee to seek judicial enforcement of a [federal or state law, or federal or state Constitutional] right or related public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Arbitration Fairness Act, Section 402 (b) (2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill would also bar the enforcement of mandatory arbitration clauses between corporations and consumers or non-union employees.&lt;ref&gt;Arbitration Fairness Act, Section 402 (a)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill‘s “findings” section states that:&lt;ref&gt;Arbitration Fairness Act, Section 2&lt;/ref&gt;*Most consumers and employees have little or no meaningful choice whether to submit their claims to arbitration.
::*Mandatory arbitration undermines the development of public law because there is inadequate transparency and inadequate judicial review of arbitrators’ decisions.
::*Arbitration can be an acceptable alternative when consent to the arbitration is truly voluntary, and occurs after the dispute arises.

[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|The House Judiciary Committee]] referred the bill to the Subcommittee on Courts, Commercial and Administrative Law on June 1, 2011.  [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|The Senate Judiciary Committee]] held hearings on the Arbitration Fairness Act on October 13, 2011.

'''Beatallica''' is a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] band that plays music made from combinations of songs of [[the Beatles]] and [[Metallica]].&lt;ref name=guitarhoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Jaymz Lennfield of Beatallica Interview|url=http://www.guitarhoo.com/interviews/jaymz-lennfield-218|work=Guitarhoo!|publisher=Guitarhoo.com|accessdate=May 8, 2014|date=July 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Beatallica song is typically a blend of a Beatles song and a Metallica song with a related title (e.g. "The Thing That Should Not Let It Be", combining The Beatles' "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]" and Metallica's "[[The Thing That Should Not Be]]" or "And Justice for All My Loving" combining Metallica's "[[...And Justice for All (song)|And Justice for All]]" and the Beatles' "[[All My Loving]]"), though sometimes just a Beatles song will be used as a basis with modified lyrics. The lyrics slip back and forth between the two songs, or occasionally neither, in lieu of original lyrics comically referencing Metallica, [[heavy metal music]], or the heavy metal community. While the [[scansion]] and melody are usually Beatles-based, the music is played metal style with some Metallica riffs and solos thrown in. Consistent quirks made in the lyrics also criticize [[glam metal]] much in the fashion that [[thrash metal]] fans would do, as well as many references to blood. Their version of "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]" called "I Want to Choke Your Band", is an example of their criticism towards glam metal.

Although facing some misunderstandings in the media, members of Metallica itself have repeatedly praised the comedic styling of the group. For example, [[Kirk Hammett]] has publicly remarked point-blank, "I think it's cool," and, "It's just fun for me." [[James Hetfield]] and [[Lars Ulrich]] have also been friendly with the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/beatallica-james-hetfield-and-lars-ulrich-have-been-nothing-but-cool-to-us/#PPbSrVCtRsTvlCPV.99|title=Beatallica: James Hetfield And Lars Ulrich Have Been Nothing But Cool To Us - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was founded in 2001 by original guitarist "Krk Hammetson" and singer "Jaymz Lennfield".&lt;ref name="guitarhoo"/&gt;  The EP ''[[A Garage Dayz Nite]]'' was recorded for the annual ''Spoof Fest'' concert held in Milwaukee, as a memento of that year's concert.  A few dozen copies of the EP were handed out to friends.  Later that year, one of those CDs made its way to Milwaukee resident Dr. David Dixon, who created a [https://web.archive.org/web/20011205044909/http://www.sensoryresearch.com/~starkeff/beatallica.html web page] that included mp3s of the songs and he named the band "Beatallica".  The band was unaware of the webpage until Dixon finally met them in the summer of 2002, carrying a stack of fan emails from all around the world.  Beatallica gave the webpage its blessings, and after further urgings from its internet fanbase, recorded the EP ''[[Beatallica (album)|Beatallica]]'', also known as ''The Grey Album'', releasing it online on April 1, 2004.

Later in 2004, the band (including bassist "Kliff McBurtney" and drummer "Ringo Larz") started to perform at live venues nationally and internationally, with a stage show incorporating elements from both Beatles and Metallica performances. They also played as an opening act for [[Dream Theater]]; [[Mike Portnoy]] even joined the band on stage playing drums for one song.

During 2005 and 2006 the band toured around the world, playing over 60 shows, including their first UK show in London on April 26, 2006. Beatallica would go on to perform with likes of [[Motörhead|Motorhead]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Kreator]], [[Sepultura]], [[LA Guns]] and play huge summer festivals worldwide, including Milwaukee's Summerfest, Germany's Earthshaker Festival, The Netherlands' Kings of Metal festival, and Korea's Busan International Rock Festival.

In 2007, the band's current lineup of Jaymz Lennfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Grg Hammetson (lead guitar), Kliff McBurtney (lead bass, backing vocals) and Ringo Larz (drums) went into the studio to re-record many of Krk and Jaymz' original songs and write some new compositions for their official debut ''[[Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band]]''.

May 2008, marked the release of Beatallica's single; "[[All You Need is Blood (song)|All You Need Is Blood]]" recorded in 13 languages as a worldwide thank-you to the network of Beatallica fans known as Beatallibangers. The band added Belgium, Czech Republic, and Poland to the list of places they have toured. [[Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band]] was released in Poland on the label Metal Mind Productions.

September and October 2008 saw the release of both album ''[[Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band]]'' and single "[[All You Need is Blood (song)|All You Need Is Blood]]" by Sony-ATV in Japan. Both Japanese CD versions contain bonus tracks.

On April 1, 2009 (Beatallica's birthday), Beatallica met Metallica backstage after Metallica's show in Paris, France. This was the first time that both bands had met each other in person. Both bands had communicated with each other over the years, as they continue to do so.

On August 4, 2009, ''[[Masterful Mystery Tour]]'', the band's second full-length album was released internationally. An official music video for the first single, Hero of the Day Tripper, was made with the band starring as hesh 1970's superheroes saving a party from the clutches of four Big Sleazers.

On September 9, 2009, ''[[Masterful Mystery Tour]]'' was released by Sony-ATV in Japan. The Japanese album version includes 2 bonus tracks, live versions of "I Want to Choke Your Band" and "Revol-ooh-tion", recorded live in concert in Milwaukee, WI.
[[File:Beatallica.jpg|thumb|300px|Beatallica performing live in [[Leipzig]], 2009.]]
September 11, 2009 [[Masterful Mystery Tour]] was released by the German label Megapress. The CD contains a bonus track, Beatallica's cover of the [[JBO (band)|JBO]] song "Eine Guten Tag Zum Sterben" (English translation: "A Good Day for Dying"). Also of note is fact that Beatallica recorded this cover song singing in German, making this the second song they have released singing in German. Beatallica's cover version of the song was also included on the JBO 2009 album ''I Don't Like Metal – I Love It'' (Limited Edition version that includes a bonus CD).

''[[Winter Plunderband]]'' was released on November 17, 2009. It is Beatallica's first ever Holiday Season release. The (EP) album is only available as a CD at Beatallica live shows (very limited pressing) and can also be purchased as a Digital Download which includes Digital Booklet with artwork, lyrics and photos (including Beatallica and [[Metallica]] together). The songs included are covers of Paul McCartney’s "[[Wonderful Christmastime]]" and John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s "[[Happy Christmas (War Is Over)]]" and also the very first two Beatallica original songs "[[Hella Day For Holiday]]" and "Heretic".

Beatallica toured Germany in December 2009 supporting [[JBO (band)|JBO]] who were celebrating their 20th anniversary. During the tour Jaymz would join J.B.O on stage to sing "Ein Guter Tag Zum Sterben" in German. On the final night of the tour in Berlin, J.B.O. (mainly Vito C.) hijacked Beatallica's set by playing AC/DC's song "[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]" on guitar from backstage. Beatallica had no idea what was going on and thought a CD somehow was being played in error from the soundboard. During J.B.O.'s final set, Beatallica came out on stage wearing J.B.O.'s pink robes, which they stole from their dressing room, and took over the stage dancing around and drinking. Jaymz used a 'Beatallica Arschwaschlappen' to wipe Hannes Holzmann's face, much to the amusement of the sold out audience.

March 5, 2009 saw the release for Beatallica's second (and third) official video entitled "Fuel on the Hill (and Benzin auf dem Berg)".

On April 16, 2013, Beatallica's third album, ''[[Abbey Load]]'', was released. Unlike other Beatallica albums, the songs on this album maintain the original lyrics written by the Beatles.

==Legal problems==
To avoid legal problems, the band maintained a strict non-commercial policy (all songs were available for free download) and shrouded themselves in anonymity (all names mentioned above are stage names, but their real names were revealed in interviews and, hence, also appear in this article). Metallica were aware of the spoof band's existence and never threatened to take any legal action; [[Lars Ulrich]], [[James Hetfield]] and [[Kirk Hammett]] have all publicly stated that they enjoy Beatallica's music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

On February 17, 2005, a [[cease-and-desist]] notice was sent to David Dixon (and the band's web host) by [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], a company which holds rights to most of The Beatles' catalog. The notice states that the "music", "news" and "merchandise" sections of the official Beatallica website constitute a [[Copyright infringement|copyright violation]] and should therefore be taken down. In response to this, a [[petition]] requesting Sony/ATV Music Publishing to retract its threat of legal action was created. The band was saved from further legal action by Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]], who offered to provide assistance with legal negotiations and also asked Metallica's longtime attorney to try to defuse the situation with Sony. Sony ultimately reached an agreement with Beatallica and their new label [[Oglio Records]], and an official Beatallica recording was released in July 2007 entitled ''[[Sgt. Hetfield's Motorbreath Pub Band]]''.

}}{{italic title|all=yes|noerror}}'''''Bliss v Canada (AG)''''' [1979] 1 S.C.R. 183 is a famous [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on equality rights for women under the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]]. The Court held that women were not entitled to benefits denied to them by the ''Unemployment Insurance Act'' during a certain period of pregnancy. This case has since become the prime example demonstrating the inadequacies of the Canadian Bill of Rights in protecting individuals' rights. This ruling was eventually overturned in ''[[Brooks v. Canada Safeway Ltd.]]'', [1989] 1 SCR 1219.

==Background==
Stella Bliss had to leave her work due to pregnancy four days before giving birth. Due to her situation she was not entitled to full benefits under section 30 of the Act, but rather she was subject to section 46 which denied her benefits for a period of six weeks after childbirth.

Bliss challenged the limitation of benefits under section 46 as a violation of section 1(b) of the Bill of Rights which protects against discrimination based on sex and ensures "the right of the individual to equality before the law and the protection of the law". Bliss claimed that the law violated her right to "equality before the law".

The [[Board of Referees]], the employment tribunal of the day, rejected her claim, however on appeal to the "Umpire" she succeeded. At the [[Federal Court of Appeal]] the Umpire's decision was overturned.

==Opinion of the Court==
Justice Ritchie, writing for a unanimous court, held that the Act was valid and did not violate the Bill of Rights equality provision.

Richie noted that the Act was a complete code that took into account the interests of women, and "any inequality between the sexes in this area is not created by legislation but by nature." This means that while the Bill of Rights guards against sex discrimination, in this case the discrimination was not against women but pregnant people.  He rejected the argument that section 46 denied "equality before the law" and found that the Act was a perfectly valid exercise of Parliament's authority to create legislation.

==Aftermath==
The decision in this case later influenced the equality rights in [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=Peter W.|title=Constitutional Law of Canada|edition=2003 Student|location=Scarborough, Ontario|publisher=Thomson Canada Limited|date=2003|pages=1066–1067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Brooks v. Safeway Canada'' (1989), the Supreme Court overturned ''Bliss''.  The Court found discrimination against pregnant people to be discrimination against women under the provincial Human Rights Code of [[Manitoba]].  Like ''Bliss'', ''Brooks'' was not a Charter case, though the Court did consider a definition of discrimination under the Charter case ''[[Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia]]''.

Stella Bliss died of brain cancer at age 56 in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1997.

{{selfref|For the blocking policy on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy]].}}

On the [[Internet]], a '''block''' or '''ban''' is a technical measure intended to restrict access to information or resources. Blocking and its inverse, unblocking, may be implemented by the owners of computers using software.&lt;ref name="Westfall"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.airsassociation.org/services-new/airs-knowledge-network-n/airs-articles/item/119-internet-blocking |title=Internet Blocking |first=Joseph |last=Westfall |year=2012 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries, [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|including China]] and Singapore, block access to certain news information.&lt;ref name="Westfall"/&gt; In the United States, the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] requires schools receiving federal funded discount rates for Internet access to install [[Content-control software|filter software]] that blocks obscene content, pornography, and, where applicable, content "harmful to minors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcc.gov/guides/childrens-internet-protection-act |title=Children's Internet Protection Act &amp;#124; FCC.gov  |work=fcc.gov |year=2012 |accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blocking may also refer to denying access to a web server based on the [[IP address]] of the client machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/access.html |title=Access Control - Apache HTTP Server|work=httpd.apache.org |year=2012 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain websites, including [[social networking service|social networks]] such as [[Facebook]] or editable databases like [[Wikimedia project]]s and other [[wiki]]s, users can apply blocks (based in either IP number or account) on other users deemed undesirable to prevent them from performing certain actions. Blocks of this kind may occur for several reasons and produce different effects: in social networks, users can unrestrictedly block other users, typically by preventing them from sending messages or viewing the blocker's information or profile. Privileged users can apply blocks that affect the access of the undesirables to the entire website.

Blocking is used by [[Internet_forum#Moderators|moderators]] and administrators of social media and forums to deny access to users that have broken their rules and will likely do so again, in order to ensure a peaceful and orderly discussion place. Common reasons for blocking are [[spamming]], [[trolling]], and [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]]. Some criticize cases of the use of bans by administrators of large websites, such as [[Twitter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/07/20/twitter-bans-milo-yiannopoulos-for-good-while-cracking-down-on-abuse/ |title=Twitter bans conservative writer Milo Yiannopoulos for good, while cracking down on abuse|year=2016 |accessdate=15 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that these bans may be politically or financially motivated. However, websites have a legal right to decide who is allowed to post, and users often respond by [[Foot voting|"voting with their feet"]] and going to a place where the administrators see their behavior as acceptable.

==Effects==
Blocked users may be completely unable to access all or part of a site's content, which is usually the case when censoring or filtering mechanisms are responsible for the block. Under a [[Stealth banning|stealth ban]], a user is given the false impression that their content is still being posted to the site, when in reality it is being hidden from all other users.

==Evasion==

Ban evasion is the act of attempting to get around a ban, whether temporary or permanent, on a website.

Alternate accounts set up by people evading bans from websites are referred to as [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|sockpuppets]]. Typically, if someone is caught evading a ban with a sockpuppet, the sockpuppet account is banned. If the original ban was temporary, it may be extended or even made permanent. Sometimes, the user's [[IP address]] may be banned as well so the user cannot access the site or create new accounts. Some sites may remove all but a few traces of the ban-evader. [[TV Tropes]] and [[Wikipedia]], for example, may mass-delete any pages created by a ban-evader.

Ban evasion can be detected by tracing a user's IP address. If two accounts are using the same IP address, it could be a sign of ban evasion. Also, the use of a [[VPN]], shown by rapid, drastic changes of IP address by the same user in a short period of time, can also be a sign that the user was trying to get around a ban. Ban evasion can also be spotted if posts or other contributions from two accounts look the same or similar, or on sites where the same email can be associated with multiple accounts, identical or similar emails can be a sign of ban evasion. Users who have been permanently banned for ban evasion may not be able to appeal their ban, which is the case on sites such as TV Tropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/WhatToDoIfYouAreSuspended|title=What to Do If You Are Suspended / Administrivia|website=Tvtropes.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating sockpuppets, ban evaders use a variety of tactics to disguise the fact that the new account was created by a previously banned user, such as using new names, an alternate email address, [[Virtual private network|VPNs]] or [[proxy server]]s to mask their IP address, changing their IP address (sometimes only needing to rely on a dynamic IP address to automatically change it after a time), or using the site from public Internet access locations such as schools and libraries.

To comply with the [[Building Act 1984]] and the subsequent [[statutory instrument]]s known as the [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]], '''Building regulations approval''' is required to construct certain structures in England and Wales. Construction projects falling into this category are sometimes referred to as "notifiable", however this is different from the "notification" (which may also be required under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, which seeks to monitor health and safety in construction projects.

The rules vary for Scotland and Northern Ireland, but elsewhere [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]] approval can usually be obtained by application to a [[building control body]] (BCB), of which there are two types: [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local Authority]] BCBs (usually a council's building control department) and private BCBs (known as Approved Inspectors). If an Approved Inspector is used, before any controlled building work can start on site they must inform the local authority about the work. This is called giving an 'initial notice'.  This notice states that a particular Approved Inspector is the BCB for the specified works, at the specified location.

If using a local authority, approval can be obtained in 1 of 3 ways:-

==1. Full Plans==
By the "full plans" method where drawings are deposited with the Local Authority and are subsequently checked for compliance with the Building Regulations.

The various stages of the work are also inspected and checked for compliance with the relevant technical requirements of the Building Regulations; by a Building Control Surveyor employed by the Local Authority.

This is the most thorough option. And a response from the Local Authority will typically take 4–8 weeks. However, unlike [[planning permission]], work may start before approval has been granted. It is also quite usual for the final building to differ in some respects to that which received full plans approval, in which case amended "as built" plans are often required to be submitted to the Local Authority.
A "completion certificate" is issued upon completion, as long as the completed work complies with the Building Regulations.

==2. Building Notice==
By the "building notice" method where notice of commencement of (minor) building work is given to the Local Authority at least two days prior to commencement of work. The various stages of the work are then inspected and approved by the Local Authority but no plans are checked.

This method may not be used if the premises contain a workplace, or creates new flats.

==3. Regularisation==
This is the retrospective approval for work already carried out without consent - and can only be administered by a Local Authority.

Most commonly, it is used by the owner of a building to apply for retrospective approval for [[illegal building]] work. The Local Authority will assess, and verify by means of site visits, plans and information submitted, identify non-compliant items, open up and inspect works, monitor the making good of defective work and, if satisfied, issue a Certificate.

An application for a Regularisation Certificate does not prevent the Authority taking legal action for failure to comply with the Building Regulations when the work was first carried out.

Generally '''Fees''' are paid to the Building Control Body, with each application. These will vary depending on the size and value of the project, and between different Local authorities across the country, and each Approved Inspector is free to set their own levels of charges. Some types of work may be exempt fees, e.g. adaptations or alterations for Disabled Persons.

Some work such as Electrical and Heating installations can be carried out by persons who can certify work as being Building Regulation compliant, without further inspection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Inspection|url=http://www.buildinginspectionsadelaide.net.au|website=BIA|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by either the Local Authority or an Approved Inspector. Any work certified in this way must however be registered with the Local Authority in the geographical area in which the work has been carried out.

A Building Control Body should issue a "Completion Certificate" or "Final Certificate" upon the practical completion of each building project, to state that the work meets the technical requirements of the Building Regulations.

If an Approved Inspector cannot do this due to omissions and/or known failures of the building work to show compliance with the relevant technical requirements of the Building Regulations, then the relevant local authority should investigate and consider the need to take appropriate enforcement action.

Building Regulation 'Enforcement Action' and/or 'incomplete work status' is normally recorded in the Local Lands Charges Register, held as a 'public record' by the relevant local authority. Solicitors must search these records prior to any purchase of any building.

'''''Canadian National Railway Co v Norsk Pacific Steamship Co''''', [1992] 1 SCR 1021 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on [[pure economic loss]] in [[tort law]]. The court recognized situations in which pure economic loss is compensable. In particular, the court held that relational economic loss falls within the category of losses that are sufficiently proximate to give rise to a [[duty of care]].

==Background==
A tug owned and operated by the Norsk Pacific Steamship Co. and Norsk Pacific Marine Services Ltd. negligently struck a railway bridge owned by [[Public Works Canada]] near the mouth of the [[Fraser River]] in [[British Columbia]]. [[Canadian National Railway]] (CN) was one of several railway companies which held contracts with PWC to use the bridge. CN was the primary user of the bridge (86% of total use) and the bridge was known locally as the "[[CNR Bridge]]". The bridge is the sole direct link between CN rails on the north and south shores of the Fraser. 

The tug owners were familiar with the area and were at all times aware that the bridge was mainly used by CN and was essential to their operations.

After the accident, it took several weeks to repair the bridge, during which time CN and other railways were forced to re-route traffic. This increased the cost of operations and reduced the freight capacity during that time.

The railways sued the tug owners and operators for the additional cost incurred as a result of the closure of the bridge. The tug owners claimed that there was no right to recover, as CN was not the owner of the bridge and suffered no direct physical or property damage. Their losses were purely economic (based on lost profits and increased operational costs), which were not generally recoverable in tort law.

==Opinion of the court==
McLachlin J. (as she then was), joined by L'Heureux-Dubé and Cory JJ., found in favour for the plaintiff CN. Using the [[Anns test|''Anns'' test]] as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in ''[[Kamloops (City) v. Nielsen]]'', she found that Norsk owed a duty of care to CN, making the loss recoverable. 

Under the first branch of the ''Anns'' test, she held that there must be sufficient proximity between the parties in addition to the damage being foreseeable. In the context of contractual relational economic loss, there must be a close examination of the facts to determine if there is sufficient closeness, including "physical propinquity, assumed or imposed obligations and close causal connection."

Under the second branch of the ''Anns'' test, she rejected three broad policy arguments advanced by the defendant: (1) the insurance argument was questionable because it assumes that victims are better suited to insure themselves than tortfeasors, (2) the loss-spreading justification is inadequate because it does not justify cases where there is only one victim, and (3) the contractual allocation of risk argument was rejected because it assumes that all businesses efficiently allocate risk and have equal bargaining power, and overlooks the concept of fault in determining liability.

Applying the law to the case, McLachlin found that CN was sufficiently close to Norsk as well as the property in question. She noted that the relationship between CN and PWC was such that the bridge could be considered a "joint" or "common venture" under which recovery for economic loss had been allowed in the United Kingdom.

==Concurrence==
Stevenson J., writing for himself, concurred with McLachlin J. on the result but did not fully endorse her view on relational economic loss. Mainly focusing on foreseeability, he held that:
:There is no danger of indeterminate liability, and thus no policy reason to deny recoverability, when the defendant actually knows or ought to know of a specific individual or individuals, as opposed to a general or unascertained class of the public, who is or are likely to suffer a foreseeable kind of loss as a result of negligence by that defendant.

==Dissent==
LaForest J. held that no duty of care arises unless the case falls within narrow exceptional categories, which does not include the case at hand. He would have upheld the traditional bright line rule excluding recovery for economic loss caused by damage to third party property.

He questioned the applicability of tort compensation in such cases and wrote that "it is legitimate to consider which party is the better loss bearer in this type of case." He found that "a denial of recovery in this case is justified in light of C.N.'s overwhelmingly superior risk bearing capacity on the facts of this case." 

In addition, LaForest J. argued that McLachlin's approach would create uncertainty in the law, as the plaintiffs could be an indeterminately large class and there is no way for the defendant to know who might be affected by damage caused by their tugboats. Under McLachlin's approach, both parties would require insurance at a high cost and thus is not economically efficient.

==Aftermath==
The state of the law on economic loss was unclear immediately following the decision in ''Norsk'', as neither McLachlin nor LaForest's judgments were the clear majority. 

In ''[[Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd.]]'', [1997] 3 SCR 1210, McLachlin clarified the result, affirming that recovery for contractual relational economic loss is the exception rather than the norm. There is a presumption against contractual relational economic loss, subject to recognized exceptional categories:
:1. Where the claimant has a possessory or proprietary interest in the damaged property;
:2. General average contribution cases; and
:3. Where the relationship between the claimant and the property owner constitutes a joint venture.

In ''[[Martel Building v. Canada]]'', [2000] 2 SCR 860, the court summed up the state of the law, partially endorsing LaForest's judgment with regards to the categories of cases that can potentially give rise to compensable economic loss. These five categories were:
#The Independent Liability of Statutory Public Authorities;
#Negligent Misrepresentation;
#Negligent Performance of a Service;
#Negligent Supply of Shoddy Goods or Structures;
#Relational Economic Loss.

These categories are not closed but will be approached on a case-by-case basis based on the rationale from ''Norsk'' and ''Bow Valley''.

'''Civil law''' is a branch of the law.&lt;ref name=Williams2&gt;[[Glanville Williams]]. 7''[[Learning the Law]]''. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[common law]] [[legal systems]] such as [[England and Wales]], the [[law of Pakistan]] and the [[law of the United States]], the term refers to non-[[criminal law]].&lt;ref name=Williams2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W J Stewart and Robert Burgess. ''Collins Dictionary of Law''. HarperCollins Publishers. 1996. {{ISBN|0 00 470009 0}}. Page 68. Definition 4 of "civil law".&lt;/ref&gt; The law relating to [[civil wrong]]s and [[quasi-contract]]s is part of the civil law,&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. ''Learning the Law''. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. pp. 2 and 9 and 10&lt;/ref&gt; as is [[law of property]] (other than property-related crimes, such as [[theft]] or [[vandalism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Card, Richard. ''[[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]''. Twelfth Edition. Butterworths. 1992. Paragraph 1.3 at page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil law may, like [[criminal law]], be divided into [[substantive law]] and [[civil procedure|procedural law]].&lt;ref&gt;Glanville Williams. ''Learning the Law''. Eleventh Edition. Stevens. 1982. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rights]] and [[duties]] of [[persons]] ([[natural persons]] and [[legal persons]]) amongst themselves is the primary concern of civil law.&lt;ref&gt;Card, Richard. ''Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law''. Twelfth Edition. Butterworths. 1992. Paragraph 1.2 at page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often suggested that civil proceedings are taken for the purpose of obtaining compensation for injury, and may thus be distinguished from criminal proceedings, whose purpose is to inflict punishment. However, [[exemplary damages]] or [[punitive damages]] may be awarded in civil proceedings. It was also formerly possible for [[common informer]]s to sue for a penalty in civil proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips]]. ''[[A First Book of English Law]]''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. pp 208 &amp; 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because some courts have both civil and criminal jurisdiction, civil proceedings cannot be defined as those taken in civil courts.&lt;ref&gt;Owen Hood Phillips. ''A First Book of English Law''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. p 208.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the expression "civil courts" is used as a shorthand for "trial courts in civil cases".&lt;ref&gt;Baum, Lawrence. American Courts: Process and Policy. Seventh Edition. Cengage Learning. 2012. Chapter 7. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZUJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT139 p 139].&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in civil proceedings is, in general—with a number of exceptions such as committal proceedings for [[civil contempt]]—proof on a [[balance of probabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;Keane and McKeown. ''The Modern Law of Evidence''. Ninth Edition. Oxford University Press. 2012. {{ISBN|9780199698325}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0TPr_O8PfX4C&amp;pg=PA108 p 108].&lt;/ref&gt; In civil cases in the law of the [[Maldives]], the burden of proof requires the [[plaintiff]] to convince the court of the plaintiff's entitlement to the relief sought. This means that the plaintiff must prove each element of the claim, or cause of action in order to recover.&lt;ref&gt;[[Husnu Al Suood]]. ''The Maldivian Legal System''. Maldives Law Institute. 2014. [https://books.google.com.ng/books?id=FUHnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA214 p 214].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related arrests==
Phoenix police arrested three women: Desaree Coronado (aged 23) and sisters Griselda and Liliana Vasquez (ages 24 and 26, respectively), on one count each of [[Obstruction of justice|hindering prosecution]] and [[Tampering with evidence|tampering with physical evidence]].  Both are [[Felony|felonies]].  Coronado was the mother of Jesus Real's child.  She was also charged with one misdemeanor count of false reporting to law enforcement.  Liliana Vasquez is Cleophus Cooksey Jr.'s ex-girlfriend.  Griselda Vasquez ultimately admitted to taking a [[mobile phone]] off Real's body.  Police say they have evidence that Liliana's car was in the area of two of the murders.

Their bonds were set at [[United States dollar|$]]3,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/3-women-accused-of-hindering-phoenix-serial-killer-probe/ 3 women accused of hindering Phoenix serial killer probe]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.''''', 337 U.S. 541 (1949), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in the wake of the decision in ''[[Guaranty Trust Co. v. York]]'' that signified a high deference to state law in [[choice of law]] issues for [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity]].

== Facts ==
Cohen's estate filed a [[Derivative_suit|shareholder derivative action]] in 1943 in federal court via [[diversity jurisdiction]]. The estate's complaint asserted that since 1929 the managers and directors of Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp. had abused their positions to enrich themselves personally at the expense of the corporation. In 1945, New Jersey passed a law that required shareholders who held less than 5% of the total shares and less than $50,000 to pay the legal bills of the defendant corporation if the suit was unsuccessful. Because the issue at hand occurred in New Jersey, the corporation wanted Cohen's estate to post a $125,000 bond to ensure they would meet that potential burden. The estate argued that applying the New Jersey law to the case would be unconstitutional because the law was enacted after the estate initially brought suit and because the law was an unconstitutional hindrance.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S. Ct. 1221, 93 L. Ed. 1528 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opinion of the Court ==
The case involved a small shareholder suing a corporation, and a [[New Jersey]] statute required the shareholder to post bond for expenses.  The [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] did not require such a bond, and the court held that the state law should be followed.  The court reasoned that the state law created a liability for litigation expenses that should be included.&lt;ref&gt;Yeazell, S.C.  ''Civil Procedure, Seventh Edition.''  Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2008, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3262">The '''''corporate opportunity''''' doctrine is the legal principle providing that [[board of directors|directors]], officers, and controlling shareholders of a [[corporation]] must not take for themselves any business opportunity that could benefit the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;18B Am. Jur. 2d ''Corporations'' § 1536 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;  The corporate opportunity doctrine is one application of the [[fiduciary]] [[duty of loyalty]].&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  
== Application ==
The corporate opportunity doctrine does not apply to all fiduciaries of a corporation; rather, it is limited to directors, officers, and controlling shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine applies regardless of whether the corporation is harmed by the transaction; indeed, it applies even if the corporation benefits from the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1538.&lt;/ref&gt;  The corporate opportunity doctrine only applies if the opportunity was not disclosed to the corporation.  If the opportunity was disclosed to the board of directors and the board declined to take the opportunity for the corporation, the fiduciary may take the opportunity for him- or herself.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1539.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the corporate opportunity doctrine applies, the corporation is entitled to all profits earned by the fiduciary from the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1538, 1540.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the leading [[English law]] case of {{cite bailii|litigants=[[Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]|year=1942|court=UKHL|num=1}} it was held that "The rule of equity which insists on those who by use of a fiduciary position make a profit, being liable to account for that profit, in no way depends on fraud, or absence of ''[[bona fide]]s'' ... or whether the plaintiff has in fact been damaged or benefited by his action."

== Elements ==
A business opportunity is a corporate opportunity if the corporation is financially able to undertake the opportunity, the opportunity is within the corporation's line of business, and the corporation has an interest or expectancy in the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' § 1536.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] has stated, "An opportunity is within a corporation's line of business . . . if it is an activity as to which the corporation has fundamental knowledge, practical experience and ability to pursue."&lt;ref&gt;''Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. v. Stewart'', 833 A.2d 961, 972-73 (Del. Ch. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''In re eBay, Inc. Shareholders Litigation'', investing in various [[securities]] was held to be in a line of business of eBay despite the fact that eBay's primary purpose is to provide an online auction platform.&lt;ref&gt;''In re eBay, Inc. S'holders Litig.'', 2004 Del. Ch. LEXIS 4 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Investing was in a line of business of eBay because eBay "consistently invested a portion of its cash on hand in marketable securities."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at *12.&lt;/ref&gt;  A corporation has an interest or expectancy in a business opportunity if the opportunity would further an established business policy of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;18B Am. Jur. 2d ''Corporations'' § 1542 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deborah Mannis-Gardner==
Deborah Mannis-Gardner is a graduate of [[Emerson College]] and began her career in the entertainment industry working on music videos and providing television clearances in New York City in 1989. Deborah got into the business of sample clearances for Hip Hop music in 1992 with a UK business partner. In 1996 she created DMG Clearances herself to focus on sample clearances and music placement.&lt;ref name="News Journal" /&gt;

Regarding the state of music sampling, Deborah has always considered it an art, "I think sampling is an art and I think it’s incredible. When I first started, I was told how it was theft. I was told that hip-hop and rap was a phase. That it wasn’t going to be around. All of that horrible, negative stuff. I kept saying “well, a collage, that’s not real art? Jambalaya isn’t real food?” That’s a great meal mixed up of different foods and spices, that’s what sampling is."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ness|first1=Jimmy|title=The Queen of Sample Clearance: An Interview With Deborah Mannis-Gardner|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/passionoftheweiss/2016/02/19/the-queen-of-sample-clearance-an-interview-with-deborah-mannis-gardner/#415245b8412f|accessdate=29 July 2016|publisher=Forbes|date=Feb 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Data Protection Directive''' (officially Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of [[Personally identifiable information|personal data]] (PII (US)) and on the free movement of such data) was a [[European Union directive]] adopted in 1995 which regulates the processing of personal data within the [[European Union]]. It is an important component of EU [[privacy law|privacy]] and [[human rights law]].

The [[General Data Protection Regulation]], adopted in April 2016, has superseded the [[Data Protection Directive]] and became enforceable starting on 25 May 2018.&lt;ref name="BlackmerGDPR16"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infolawgroup.com/2016/05/articles/gdpr/gdpr-getting-ready-for-the-new-eu-general-data-protection-regulation/ |title=GDPR: Getting Ready for the New EU General Data Protection Regulation |author=Blackmer, W.S. |work=Information Law Group |publisher=InfoLawGroup LLP |date=5 May 2016 |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The right to [[privacy]] is a highly developed area of law in Europe. All the member states of the [[European Union]] (EU) are also signatories of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR). Article 8 of the ECHR provides a right to respect for one's "private and family life, his home and his correspondence", subject to certain restrictions. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] has given this article a very broad interpretation in its jurisprudence.

In 1980, in an effort to create a comprehensive data protection system throughout Europe, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) issued its "Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,2340,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data] The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development, last modified 5 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The seven principles governing the [[OECD]]’s recommendations for protection of personal data were:
# Notice—data subjects should be given notice when their data is being collected;
# Purpose—data should only be used for the purpose stated and not for any other purposes;
# Consent—data should not be disclosed without the data subject’s consent;
# Security—collected data should be kept secure from any potential abuses;
# Disclosure—data subjects should be informed as to who is collecting their data;
# Access—data subjects should be allowed to access their data and make corrections to any inaccurate data
# Accountability—data subjects should have a method available to them to hold data collectors accountable for not following the above principles.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anna E. |last=Shimanek |title=Do you Want Milk with those Cookies?: Complying with Safe Harbor Privacy Principles |journal=Journal of Corporation Law |year=2001 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=455, 462–463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OECD]] Guidelines, however, were non-binding, and data privacy laws still varied widely across Europe. The United States, meanwhile, while endorsing the [[OECD]]'s recommendations, did nothing to implement them within the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, all seven principles were incorporated into the EU Directive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1981 the [[Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]] was negotiated within the [[Council of Europe]]. This convention obliges the signatories to enact legislation concerning the automatic processing of personal data, which many duly did.

The [[European Commission]] realized that diverging data protection legislation amongst EU member states impeded the free flow of data within the EU and accordingly proposed the Data Protection Directive.

==Content==
The directive regulates the processing of personal data regardless of whether such processing is automated or not.

===Scope===
''Personal data'' are defined as "any information relating to an identified or identifiable [[natural person]] ("data subject"); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;" (art. 2 a).

This definition is meant to be very broad. Data are "personal data" when someone is able to link the information to a person, even if the person holding the data cannot make this link. Some examples of "personal data" are: address, [[Payment card number|credit card number]], bank statements, criminal record, etc.

The notion ''processing'' means "any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure or destruction;" (art. 2 b).

The responsibility for compliance rests on the shoulders of the "controller", meaning the [[natural person|natural]] or [[Juristic person|artificial person]], public authority, agency or any other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; (art. 2 d)

The data protection rules are applicable not only when the controller is established within the EU, but whenever the controller uses equipment situated within the EU in order to process data. (art. 4) Controllers from outside the EU, processing data in the EU, will have to follow data protection regulation. In principle, any online business trading with EU residents would process some personal data and would be using equipment in the EU to process the data (i.e. the customer's computer). As a consequence, the website operator would have to comply with the European data protection rules. The directive was written before the breakthrough of the Internet, and to date there is little [[jurisprudence]] on this subject.

===Principles===
Personal data should not be processed at all, except when certain conditions are met. These conditions fall into three categories: transparency, legitimate purpose, and proportionality.

====Transparency====
The data subject has the right to be informed when his personal data is being processed. The controller must provide his name and address, the purpose of processing, the recipients of the data and all other information required to ensure the processing is fair. (art. 10 and 11)

Data may be processed only if at least one of the following is true (art. 7):
* when the data subject has given his consent.
* when the processing is necessary for the performance of or the entering into a contract.
* when processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
* when processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject.
* processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the [[public interest]] or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party to whom the data are disclosed.
* processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are over-ridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. The data subject has the right to access all data processed about him. The data subject even has the right to demand the rectification, deletion or blocking of data that is incomplete, inaccurate or not being processed in compliance with the data protection rules. (art. 12)

====Legitimate purpose====
Personal data can only be processed for specified explicit and legitimate purposes and may not be processed further in a way incompatible with those purposes. (art. 6 b) The personal data must have protection from misuse and respect for the "certain rights of the data owners which are guaranteed by EU law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of personal data – European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/|publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proportionality====
Personal data may be processed only insofar as it is adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed.
The data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that data which are inaccurate or incomplete, having regard to the purposes for which they were collected or for which they are further processed, are erased or rectified;
The data shouldn't be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or for which they are further processed. Member States shall lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data stored for longer periods for historical, statistical or scientific use. (art. 6).

When sensitive personal data (can be: religious beliefs, political opinions, health, sexual orientation, race, membership of past organisations) are being processed, extra restrictions apply. (art. 8).

The data subject may object at any time to the processing of personal data for the purpose of direct marketing. (art. 14)

An algorithmic-based decision which produces legal effects or significantly affects the data subject may not be based solely on automated processing of data. (art. 15) A form of appeal should be provided when automatic decision making processes are used.

===Supervisory authority and the public register of processing operations===
Each member state must set up a supervisory authority, an independent body that will monitor the data protection level in that member state, give advice to the government about administrative measures and regulations, and start legal proceedings when data protection regulation has been violated. (art. 28)  Individuals may lodge complaints about violations to the supervisory authority or in a court of law.

The controller must notify the supervisory authority before he starts to process data. The notification contains at least the following information (art. 19):
* the name and address of the controller and of his representative, if any;
* the purpose or purposes of the processing;
* a description of the category or categories of data subject and of the data or categories of data relating to them;
* the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the data might be disclosed;
* proposed transfers of data to third countries;
* a general description of the measures taken to ensure security of processing.
This information is kept in a public register.

===Transfer of personal data to third countries===
''Third countries'' is the term used in legislation to designate countries outside the [[European Union]].
Personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection. Some exceptions to this rule are provided, for instance when the controller himself can guarantee that the recipient will comply with the data protection rules.

The Directive's Article 29 created the "Working party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data", commonly known as the "[[Article 29 Working Party]]". The Working Party gives advice about the level of protection in the European Union and third countries.

The Working Party negotiated with United States representatives about the protection of personal data, the [[Safe harbor (law)#European Union|Safe Harbour Principles]] were the result. According to critics the Safe Harbour Principles do not provide for an adequate level of protection, because they contain fewer obligations for the controller and allow the contractual waiver of certain rights.

In October 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled that the Safe Harbour regime was invalid as a result of an action brought by an Austrian privacy campaigner in relation to the export of subscribers' data by Facebook's European business to Facebook in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=169195&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=162892 |title=Judgement of the Court (Grand Chamber) – 6 October 2015 |work=InfoCuria |date=6 October 2015 |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US and European Authorities worked on a replacement for Safe Harbour and an agreement was reached in February 2016, leading to the European Commission adopting the [[EU-US Privacy Shield]] framework on 12 July 2016.

In July 2007, a new, controversial,&lt;ref name="R89"/&gt; [[passenger name record]] (PNR) agreement between the US and the EU was undersigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112021643/http://www.libertysecurity.org/article1591.html|title=New EU-US PNR Agreement on the processing and transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data|website=''libertysecurity.org''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, [[Jonathan Faull]], the head of the EU's Commission of Home Affairs, complained about the United States bilateral policy concerning PNR.&lt;ref name="Faull"&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/25657 Brussels attacks new U.S. security demands], ''[[EUobserver]]''. See also [http://www.statewatch.org/news/ Statewatch newsletter] February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The US had signed in February 2008 a memorandum of understanding&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statewatch.org/news/2008/mar/us-czech-mou-visas-etc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (MOU) with the [[Czech Republic]] in exchange of a visa waiver scheme, without first consulting Brussels.&lt;ref name=R89&gt;[http://www.rue89.com/2008/03/04/a-divided-europe-wants-to-protect-its-personal-data-wanted-by-the-us A divided Europe wants to protect its personal data wanted by the U.S.], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 4 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The tensions between Washington and Brussels are mainly caused by the lower level of [[data protection]] in the US, especially since foreigners do not benefit from the US [[Privacy Act of 1974]]. Other countries approached for bilateral Memoranda of Understandings included the United Kingdom, [[Estonia]], (Germany) and [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Statewatch]], March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation by the member states==
EU directives are addressed to the member states, and are not legally binding for individuals in principle. The member states must transpose the directive into internal law.
Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data had to be transposed by the end of 1998. All member states have enacted their own data protection legislation.

==Comparison with United States data protection law==
{{As of|2003}}, the United States has not a single data protection law comparable to the EU's Data Protection Directive.&lt;ref&gt;See Julia M. Fromholz, The European Union Data Privacy Directive, 15 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 471, 472 (2000); Dean William Harvey &amp; Amy White, The Impact of Computer Security Regulation on American Companies, 8 Tex. Wesleyan L. Rev. 505 (2002); Kamaal Zaidi, Harmonizing U.S.-EU Online Privacy Law: Toward a U.S. Comprehensive Regime For the Protection of Personal Data, 12 Mich.St. J. Int'l L. 169 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

United States privacy legislation tends to be adopted on an ''ad hoc'' basis, with legislation arising when certain sectors and circumstances require (e.g., the [[Video Privacy Protection Act]] of 1988, the [[Cable Television Protection and Competition Act]] of 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Legislation |first=USA |title=CABLE TELEVISION CONSUMER PROTECTION AND COMPETITION ACT OF 1992 |url=http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/OSEC/library/legislative_histories/1439.pdf |year=1992 |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], and the 1996 [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]], HIPAA (US)). Therefore, while certain sectors may already satisfy the EU Directive, at least in part, most do not.&lt;ref&gt;Fromholz, supra&lt;/ref&gt; The United States prefers what it calls a 'sectoral' approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|first1=Ian J.|title=Information technology law|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [etc.]|isbn=978-0199588749|page=26|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; to data protection legislation, which relies on a combination of legislation, regulation, and self-regulation, rather than governmental regulation alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=William J. |last1=Clinton |first2=Albert |last2=Gore, Jr.|title= A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce|date= 1 July 1997|url= http://www.technology.gov/digeconomy/framewrk.htm|website=technology.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol70/iss6/29/|title=You Cheated, You Lied:  The Safe Harbor Agreement and its Enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission|first=Schriver, Robert|last=R.|date=20 February 2018|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=70|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former US President [[Bill Clinton]] and former Vice-President [[Al Gore]] explicitly recommended in their "Framework for Global Electronic Commerce" that the private sector should lead, and companies should implement self-regulation in reaction to issues brought on by Internet technology.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton &amp; Gore, supra&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasoning behind this approach probably{{original research inline|date=October 2015}} has as much to do with American [[laissez-faire economics]] as with different social perspectives.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]] guarantees the right to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;United States Const. amend. I.&lt;/ref&gt; While free speech is an explicit right guaranteed by the [[United States Constitution]], privacy is an implicit right guaranteed by the Constitution as interpreted by the [[United States Supreme Court]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Roe v. Wade]], 410 US 113 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; although it is often an explicit right in many state constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Article 1 of the [[California Constitution]]: "All people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are … privacy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's extensive privacy regulation is justified with reference to experiences under [[World War II]]-era fascist governments and post-War [[Communist]] regimes, where there was widespread unchecked use of personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/text37&amp;div=19&amp;id=&amp;page= Ryan Moshell, ''...And Then There was one: The Outlook for a Self-Regulatory United States Amidst a Global Trend Toward Comprehensive Data Protection'', 37 Tex.

Laribee &amp; Stephen D. Hogan, The Right to Privacy and Person Data: The EU Prods the U.S. and Controversy Continues, 9 Tulsa J. Comp. &amp; Int'l L. 391, 441 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  (Germany) and France, in particular, set forth comprehensive data protection laws.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition to the General Data Protection Regulation==
On 25 January 2012, the [[European Commission]] (EC) announced it would attempt to unify data protection law across a unified European Union via proposed legislation called the "[[General Data Protection Regulation]]." The EC's objectives with this new legislation included:&lt;ref name="MLGNew12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlawgroup.de/news/publications/detail.php?we_objectID=227 |title=New draft European data protection regime |publisher=m law group |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the harmonisation of 27 national data protection regulations into one unified regulation;
* the improvement of corporate data transfer rules outside the European Union; and
* the improvement of user control over personal identifying data.

The original proposal also dictated that the legislation would in theory "apply for all non-E.U. companies without any establishment in the E.U., provided that the processing of data is directed at E.U. residents," one of the biggest changes with the new legislation.&lt;ref name="MLGNew12" /&gt; This proposed change carried on through to the legislation's final approval on 14 April 2016, potentially affecting entities around the world. "The Regulation applies to processing outside the EU that relates to the offering of goods or services to data subjects (individuals) in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior," according to W. Scott Blackmer of the InfoLawGroup, though he added "[i]t is questionable whether European supervisory authorities or consumers would actually try to sue US-based operators over violations of the Regulation."&lt;ref name="BlackmerGDPR16" /&gt; Additional changes include stricter conditions for consent, broader definition of sensitive data, new provisions on protecting children's privacy, and the inclusion of "rights to be forgotten."&lt;ref name="BlackmerGDPR16" /&gt;

The EC has set a compliance date of 25 May 2018, giving businesses around the world a chance to prepare for compliance, review data protection language in contracts, consider transition to international standards, update privacy policies, and review marketing plans.

The ''Deutsches Rechtswörterbuch'' (DRW) or ''Dictionary of Historical German Legal Terms'' is a historic legal dictionary developed under the aegis of the [[Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. The research unit took up work in 1897 and until today has completed 93.155 articles, ranging from ''Aachenfahrt'' (pilgrimage to [[Aachen]]) to ''selbzwölft'' (being one of twelve persons). These have been published in 12 consecutive volumes and are also freely accessible online. In course of its research, the DRW also touches upon sources in [[Old English]], of Hanseatic provenience and [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]]. The research unit will presumably conclude its work in 2036.

== Objectives ==
[[File:Deutsches Rechtswoerterbuch DRW 12Baende.jpg|thumb|So far published 12 volumes of the Dictionary of Historical German Legal Terms]]The DRW aims at covering German legal terminology from the [[Middle Ages]] up to the beginning of the 19th century. In this context, legal language is understood as a general historical vocabulary in reference to legal meanings. The research unit wants to outline how legal concepts, convictions and institutions manifested themselves in everyday language. Concomitantly, the DRW does not only contain legal terms, but common phrases bearing relation to legal contexts. Furthermore, the DRW as part of its research lists the legally relevant vocabulary, not only of [[New High German|Modern High German]], but of all Western German language varieties. The dictionary cites usage of historical vocabulary from various regions of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] area from England to Transylvania, from Lorraine to the Baltic Seas. In order to capture the full lexical diversity of meanings for each word, the dictionary employs techniques of synchronic and diachronic comparative law in addition to purely linguistic and lexicographic approaches, against the backdrop of historical contextualisation.

As Germany’s Federal President [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] once wrote:

“The ''Rechtswörterbuch'' incorporates language- and culture-historical references beyond purely legal understandings, thus making the work truly cross-disciplinary.”&lt;ref&gt;German quote via [http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/%7Ecd2/drw/presse.htm http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~cd2/drw/presse.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:DRW-Belegzettel zum Wort Morgengabe.jpg|thumb|In the early years of the research unit's work, such paper slides were created to register references from the historical sources. This paper slide from the archive gives reference to "Morgengabe".]]
The DRW was initiated in 1896/97 as a project of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Royal Prussian Academy of Science]] at about the same time as other fundamental dictionary projects like the [[Schweizerisches Idiotikon]]. Perhaps, the envisioned ''Dictionary on Anglo-Norman Legal Terms'' by the [[Selden Society]] served as an inspiration (the renamed ''Dictionary of Law French'' compiled by Elsie Shanks sadly has never been published). Leading German capacities in the field of legal history, history and language history like [[Heinrich Brunner]], [[Ernst Dümmler]] and [[Karl Weinhold]] belonged to the founding commission. [[Otto von Gierke]] was also a founding member and being rooted in the tradition of the [[German Historical School]] pledged for the inclusion of the West Germanic languages. Since the first head of research unit, Prof. Dr. iur. Richard Schröder, held office in [[Heidelberg]], the DRW has been located from the start in the historic city on the river [[Neckar]]. Schröder’s successor was Prof. Eberhard Freiherr von Künßberg. Since he was married to a Jewish woman, the family had to emigrate to the United States (see descendants [[Ekkehard von Kuenssberg]] and [[Laura Kuenssberg]]).&lt;ref&gt;Klaus-Peter Schroeder, Eberhard Freiherr von Künßberg (1881-1941), in: Andreas Deutsch (ed.), Das Deutsche Rechtswörterbuch – Perspektiven, Heidelberg 2010, p. 54f. and 58.&lt;/ref&gt; This circumstances contributed to the inner and outer turmoil the research unit faced in the wake of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] and [[World War II]]. Arising from the [[Division of germany|division of Germany]] and the dissolution of the Prussian academy (hence called [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin]]), the DRW was incorporated into the Heidelberg academy in 1959. Forty years later, the late head of research unit Dr. Heino Speer, initialised the free of charge Internet publication.

== Modus operandi and sources ==
Every article deals with a certain word, which has been lemmatised into a standard German form. It contains linguistic information, explanations regarding the word’s acceptation(s) and the specific legal context. All meanings and [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are illustrated by means of historical evidence cited in original language and excerpted from the DRW’s selection of sources. As main sources the DRW used various titles, from which more than two million quotations have been extracted in the research units’ early years. The excerpts were written on paper slides and are retrieved from the paper slide archive to the present day, as the basis of the research work. Owing to clarity, the DRW provides the used titles with scribal abbreviations. The catalogue of these so called ''Siglen'' amount to over 8000 titles in total and consist of:

·      over 4300 Monographs

·      over 1900 multipart items and series

·      over 900 journals

·      over 1000 non-independent works

The sources used date back from 500 AD to 1835 AD and cover the following languages:

·      vernacular words from early Latin texts (500 - 800)

·      Old English (600 - 1100)

·      [[Old High German]] (600 - 1050)

·      [[Lombardic language|Lombardic]] (650 - 1000)

·      [[Old Dutch]] (700 - 1200)

·      [[Old Saxon]] (800 - 1200)

·      [[Old Frisian]] (800 - 1500)

·      [[Middle High German]] (1050 - 1350)

·      [[Middle Dutch]] (1200 - 1500/1600)

·      [[Middle Low German]] (1200 - 1650)

·      [[Early New High German|Early Modern High German]] (1350 – 1650)

·      Modern High German (1650 - 1835)

The dictionary's oldest evidence dates back to 479 AD and was excerpted from a Merovingian Charter at the time of [[Clovis I]]. The word at issue is "mundburt" (meaning a lord's special protection rights) for which [[Felix Liebermann]]'s ''Die'' ''Gesetze der Angelsachsen'' ("mundbyrd", 685/86) provides evidence. Old English texts thus amount to a major part of the oldest sources cited in the DRW.

The DRW has made arrangements, which have to be met, in order for compounds and simplexes to be featured in the articles. Compounds should not exceed the turn of the 18th century. In order for a simplex to be included in the dictionary, the word's first verifiable evidence must date from 1815, at the latest. Terms originating from the designated timeframe of 1815 to 1835 will not be printed, but published with short reference in the online version.

== English sources ==
In particular, Liebermann’s aforementioned ''Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen'' (The Anglo-Saxons‘ Law) serve as an important source for the DRW with regard to Old English. ''Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen'' contains the laws proclaimed by Anglo-Saxon rulers over the course of 5 centuries and remains “authoritative” and “unsurpassed” in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Book description by Cambridge University press via http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9781316225141&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to Old English, cross references are at times given to the seminal ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary|Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]'' by Bosworth and Toller.

In addition, many legal documents concerning the [[Hanseatic League]] and their ''Stahlhof'' ([[Steelyard]]) in London might bear special interest for the English user.

Following migration to North America in the 17th and 18th century, German settlers from the [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhine Franconian]] language region preserved their dialects nowadays known as Pennsylvania German languages. Pennsylvania German words, thus also find their way into the DRW, e.g. freiheitsbâm &gt; Freiheitsbaum (tree of freedom) according to Lambert’s ''Dictionary of the non-English words of the Pennsylvania-German dialect'' meaning black poplar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2908">"'''Dostoevsky and Parricide'''" ({{lang-de|Dostojewski und die Vatertötung}}) is an introductory article contributed by [[Sigmund Freud]] to a scholarly collection on ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. The collection was published in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (Penguin 1964) p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; The article argues that it is no coincidence that some of the greatest works of world literature - including ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', as well as ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' – all concern [[parricide]], which in Dostoevsky's case Freud links to his [[epilepsy]].

[[Ernest Jones]] termed the piece “Freud's last contribution to the psychology of literature and his most brilliant”;&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (Penguin 1964) p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; Freud himself however called it “this trivial essay. It was written as a favour for someone and written reluctantly”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (1974) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gambling==
The second section of Freud's essay turned away from a primary consideration of  ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' to consider the related question of Dostoevsky's gambling. Freud saw gambling as a defiant struggle with Fate (concealing the [[father figure]]);&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; the associated guilt was the reason for the gambler's compulsion to lose. As Freud himself put it with reference to Dostoyevsky's wife:&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, 'Dostoevsky and Parricide' in J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (1974) p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;”she had noticed that the one thing which offered any real hope of salvation – his literary production – never went better than when they had lost everything....When his sense of guilt was satisfied by the punishments he had inflicted on himself, the inhibition on his work became less severe.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
The police were looking for a suspect that had just committed an armed robbery. Police were told that he lived in the "back flat" of an address, and a search warrant was duly drafted.

However, when they came to the address, it was hard to determine which was the "back flat", which was unfortunate for the 3 occupants of the front flat, as well as their 3 visitors.

The 6 occupants had firearms pointed at them, searched, and forced to lay on the ground, whilst the police proceeded to arrest the armed robbery suspect who was in the other flat.

The parties sued the police for breaching the Bill of Rights Act, for unlawful search and detention. The police defended the matter claiming section 71 of the Arms Act immunized them here.

==Decision==
The Court of Appeal, sitting as a bench of five, ruled that they had been subject to unlawful detention, awarding B $18,000 and G $16,000. The court did however reverse the previous awarding of exemplary costs.

'''''Geduldig v. Aiello''''', 417 U.S. 484 (1974), was an [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] case in the [[United States]] in which the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled on whether unfavorable treatment to pregnant women could count as sex discrimination. It held that the denial of [[insurance]] benefits for work loss resulting from a normal [[pregnancy]] did not violate the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].  The [[California]] insurance program at issue did not exclude workers from eligibility based on [[sex]] but excluded pregnancy from a list of compensable [[disabilities]]. The majority found that even though only women would be directly affected by the administrative decision, the classification of normal pregnancy as non-compensable was not a sex-based classification and so the court would defer to the state so long as it could provide a [[rational basis review|rational basis]] for its categorization.

==Facts==
From 1946, California ran an insurance system to cover private sector employees if temporarily unemployed because of a disability not covered by [[Disability insurance#Workers.27 compensation|workmen's compensation]]. It was funded by contributions deducted from the wages of participating employees, for whom participation was generally mandatory unless they belonged to an approved private insurance plan. Employees who had contributed 1% of a minimum income to the disability fund for one year prior to a period of disability were eligible to receive benefits.  However, certain disabilities would not be covered, including those resulting from [[involuntary commitment|commitment]] for [[dipsomania]], [[drug addiction]], or [[Human sexual behavior|sexual]] [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;In his dissent, Justice Brennan pointed out that at oral arguments, the  Deputy Attorney General of California testified that such commitments for these conditions were “fairly archaic” and did not realistically constitute “valid exclusions” from the insurance program.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Geduldig'', the [[Appeal#Who can appeal|appellees]] challenged the further exclusion of certain disabilities resulting from pregnancy, as found in §2626 of the Unemployment Insurance Code: “In no case shall the term ‘disability’ or ‘disabled’ include any injury or illness caused by or arising in connection with pregnancy up to the termination of such pregnancy and for a period of 28 days thereafter.”

The litigation began as two separate [[class action]] suits brought by employees who had paid into the state’s disability fund but who had been denied benefits relating to pregnancy-related disabilities.  Three of the employees suffered employment disability after complications that arose during their pregnancies, while the fourth experienced a normal pregnancy which still led to a temporary inability to work.  Carolyn Aiello brought suit in [[United States district court|Federal District Court]], while Augustina Armendariz, Elizabeth Johnson, and Jacqueline Jaramillo brought suit as a petition for a [[mandamus|writ of mandate]] in the [[Supreme Court of California|state’s supreme court]].  The separate cases were consolidated when the state suit was [[removal jurisdiction|removed]] to federal court by the [[Appeal#Who can appeal|appellant]], Dwight Geduldig, Director of the California Department of Human Resources Development.

Initially, the appellees sought to [[injunction|enjoin]] enforcement of the exclusionary policy, and the District Court, as a divided three-judge panel, granted their [[Motion (legal)|motion]] for [[summary judgment]], holding that the program’s administration violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and stating that “the exclusion of pregnancy-related disabilities is not based upon a classification having a rational and substantial relationship to a legitimate state purpose.”  The court further denied a motion to stay its judgment pending [[appeal]].  The appellant proceeded to file a similar motion with the Supreme Court, which noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal.

Although three of the appellees brought suit to recover benefits for loss of work after complications from pregnancy ([[ectopic pregnancy|tubal and ectopic pregnancies]] and a [[miscarriage]]), this issue was [[mootness|moot]] by the time the case reached the Supreme Court due to a decision in another case.  In ''Rentzer v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board,'' the state court interpreted the statute as applying only to benefit payments for disabilities resulting from normal pregnancies, thus allowing a woman who had suffered an [[ectopic pregnancy]] to recover benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''Rentzer v. California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board,'' 32 Cal. App.3d 604, 108 Cal. Rptr. 336 (Cal. App.2.Dist. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the only remaining live controversy in ''Geduldig'' was whether appellee Jaramillo and others similarly situated were entitled to benefits for work loss related to normal and generally healthy pregnancy and [[childbirth]].

==Judgment==
Part II of the majority opinion first laid out the [[Rational basis review|rational basis]] for the policy as argued by the state.  Justice Stewart focused largely on the [[economics]] of the benefit system, which had been operating as a self-supporting system since its inception.  The contribution rate to the disability fund as set struck a balance that allowed the state to cover the health conditions that it had deemed eligible under the program: in the years immediately preceding ''Geduldig,'' 90-103% of the disability fund's revenue had been utilized to pay disability and [[hospital]] benefits.  Both parties acknowledged that to cover more disability risks would require an increase in the amount of money going into the fund, although they disagreed on the amount this would entail.&lt;ref&gt;The appellants argued the increase would be between $120.2 million and $131 million per year, a 33-36% increase in the amount of benefits paid out to California citizens, while the appellees maintained that the increase would be $48.9 million, a 12% overall increase.&lt;/ref&gt;  The District Court accepted the state's estimate that to cover normal pregnancy and delivery would require the fund to pay out over $100 million more in benefits but found that this would not destroy the [[solvency]] of the program, although it would require “reasonable changes in the contribution rate, the maximum benefits allowable, and other variables.”&lt;ref&gt;''Aiello v. Hansen,'' 359 F.Supp. 792, 7 Fair Empl. Prac.Cas. (BNA) 1041, 7 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 9283 (D.C.Cal. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  The state, however, argued that such changes would jeopardize the ability of [[poverty|low-income]] Californians to participate in the program, and thus it had a rational basis to maintain the system in its existing state.

The majority pointed to ''[[Williamson v. Lee Optical]],'' in which the Court found that a legislature could legitimately address problems in [[Gradualism|phases]], prioritizing issues which were most pressing.  The ''Geduldig'' majority stated that it would be particularly hesitant to second-guess such prioritization and legislative calculation in regards to [[Social welfare provision|social welfare programs]], citing the premise in ''Dandridge v. Williams'' that the Equal Protection Clause “does not require that a State must choose between attacking every aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.”&lt;ref&gt;''Dandridge v. Williams,'' 397 U.S. 471, 486-487, 90 S.Ct. 1153, 1162, 25 L.Ed.2d 491 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  California, the majority held, could legitimately and constitutionally decide that it was better to “keep benefit payments at an adequate level for disabilities that are covered, rather than to cover all disabilities inadequately.”

Finally, Stewart's opinion turned to the issue of whether California's rational basis for its policy was sufficient to uphold the state's position.  The majority found in the insurance system no invidious discrimination that would violate the Equal Protection Clause, pointing out that women as a group were still eligible for benefits even though the particular condition of pregnancy might not be covered.  The Court reasoned that there was “no risk from which men are protected and women are not,” and “no risk from which women are protected and men are not.”  As stated in Footnote 20 of the majority opinion,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The program divides potential recipients into two groups-pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the Court acknowledged that only women could undergo the excluded condition, “it does not follow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification.”  Pregnancy was an objectively identifiable characteristic rather than a subjective judgment, and the appellants had made no showing that the state's asserted rationale for the policy was a pretext for invidious discrimination. Thus, California's policy was not one which the Court would subject to the [[Intermediate scrutiny|heightened scrutiny]] that it had used to evaluate cases such as ''[[Reed v. Reed]]'' and ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]],'' and therefore the rational basis presented by the state was enough to allow the policy to stand.

The majority reversed the lower court's decision and vacated the stay previously granted.

===Dissent===
Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Douglas and Marshall, dissented from the majority's opinion, arguing that under ''Reed'' and ''Frontiero,'' intermediate scrutiny was the proper level of review for the issue, and that under this analysis California's classification failed, as the appellants had only set out a rational basis for the state's policy.  The dissenters acknowledged that the fiscal solvency of California's insurance program was a legitimate concern and that to include temporary disabilities resulting from normal pregnancy in the scope of conditions covered by the system would require an increase in the employee contribution, an increase in the yearly contribution ceiling, or state subsidization.  However,

&lt;blockquote&gt;whatever role such monetary considerations may play in traditional equal protection analysis, the State’s interest in preserving the fiscal integrity of its disability insurance program simply cannot render the State’s use of a suspect classification constitutional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dissenters pointed out that pregnancy was one of the only common conditions affecting health that was not covered by the broad scope of California's Unemployment Insurance Code, even though the economic results of it might be functionally identical to those of other disabilities, in that wages might be lost due to temporary physical inability to work, and even in healthy individuals, pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum care are costly.

Brennan and the other dissenters viewed the state's policy as “singling out for less favorable treatment a gender-linked disability peculiar to women,” creating a “double standard.”  They interpreted the policy as one in which

&lt;blockquote&gt;a limitation is imposed upon the disabilities for which women workers may recover, while men receive full compensation for all disabilities suffered.  ...In effect, one set of rules is applied to females and another to males.  Such dissimilar treatment of men and women, on the basis of physical characteristics inextricably linked to one sex, inevitably constitutes sex discrimination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dissenters expressed dissatisfaction with the majority's explanation for its refusal to apply a higher standard of review in a case involving issues tied to sex.  Brennan, Douglas and Marshall viewed Stewart's opinion as a retreat from recent equal protection decisions and voiced concern that the majority's decision would relegate sex-based classifications to the same “traditional” analysis that had allowed legislation such as that in ''[[Muller v. Oregon]].''

The '''General Maximum''', or '''Law of the Maximum''', was a law during the [[French Revolution]], as an extension of the [[Law of Suspects]] on 29 September 1793. It succeeded the 4 May 1793 ''loi du maximum'' that also set [[price controls|price limits]], deterred [[price gouging]], and allowed for the continued flow of food supply to the French people.&lt;ref&gt;White, E. "The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770–1815."  ''The Journal of Economic History'' 1995, p 244&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Competing theories exist as to the causes of the conditions the General Maximum was intended to ameliorate.

Eugene White, in his 1995 publication "The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770–1815", views that years of revolution, international conflicts, and poor climate conditions had led to an economic environment with massive inflation and food shortages throughout France.&lt;ref&gt;White, E. "The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770–1815." ''The Journal of Economic History'' 1995, p 236-238&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Dickson White, Professor of History at Cornell, suggests that the ever-greater and ultimately uncontrolled issuance of paper money authorised by the National Assembly was at the root of France's economic failure and most certainly the cause of its increasingly rampant inflation &lt;ref&gt;White, A.D,  "Fiat Money Inflation in France" 1912, The White Collection at the Cornell University, http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/subjects/frrev.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it varied according to region, the maximum price for first necessity goods was about a third higher than the 1790 prices, and the legal maximum fixed to the wages was about half higher than the average level in 1790{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Committee members feared new and more radical revolutionaries were being created by the crisis{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.The fear was intensified on 5 September 1793, when the [[sans-culottes]] invaded the [[National Convention]] demanding "Food- and to have it, force for the law."&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, RR. ''Twelve Who Ruled''. Princeton University Press, 1970, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

On 29 September 1793, the [[Law of Suspects]] was extended to include the General Maximum. The [[Law of Suspects]] was initially created to deal with counter-revolutionaries, but hunger and poverty were seen by the [[Committee of Public Safety]] as dangerous to both the national interest and their positions within the government.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, M. "Economic Terror in the City: The General Maximum in Montauban." ''French Historical Studies'' 1991, p 500&lt;/ref&gt; 

The law set forth uniform price ceilings on grain, flour, meat, oil, onions, soap, firewood, leather, and paper; their sale were regulated a third over the maximum price set in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, M. "Economic Terror in the City: The General Maximum in Montauban." ''French Historical Studies'' 1991, p 498&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, E. "The French Revolution and the Politics of Government Finance, 1770–1815."  ''The Journal of Economic History'' 1995, p 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Written into the text of the law were regulations and fines. Merchants had to post their maximum rates in a conspicuous location for all consumers to see and were subject to repeated inspections by police and local officials. Furthermore, the law gave legal protection to consumers who reported violations of the Maximum to local officials. If the consumer did not have a role in the infraction and gave report to the proper authorities denouncing the merchant, fines would be levied against only shop owners.

==Effects==
In 1793, the [[French Revolution]] caused wars with [[Austria]], [[Prussia]], Great Britain and Spain. The government continued to function during the economic and political crises by a series of loans, bonds and tax increases; an increasingly large amount of paper money issuance was a vain attempt to stimulate the economy.&lt;ref&gt;AD White "Fiat Money Inflation In France", 1912, The White Collection at the Cornell University library http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/subjects/frrev.html 
&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the law actually exacerbated the problem, as the new price setting led to many food producers lowering their production or halting altogether, while many of those who continued to produce held onto their inventories, rather than sell at the legal price, which was often below the cost of production. This led to continued food shortages and recurring famines throughout the country. The Committee of Public Safety responded by sending soldiers into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize their crops. This temporarily alleviated the shortages in Paris, however it led to shortages becoming more intense in the rest of the country.

The law was written with an eye towards preventing business practices like [[price gouging]] and [[rent seeking]], but in practice, the law targeted local shopkeepers, butchers, bakers and farmers, who were already feeling the effects of the economic downturn like other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, M. "Economic Terror in the City: The General Maximum in Montauban." ''French Historical Studies'' 1991, p 503-505&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
The General Maximum's economic impact was largely negative, as its efforts at price control led to an overall decrease in food supply and prolonged famines in parts of the country. The law amplified parts of the problem it was trying to solve. The political and symbolic impact of the General Maximum were clear, as the harsh punishments enacted upon those who breached the Maximum became a symbol of the Reign of Terror.

The '''''Hastings Environmental Law Journal''''' is a student-run [[law review]] published at the [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]]. The journal primarily covers [[environmental law|environmental law and policy]] and related subjects with a regional focus in [[California]], [[Hawai'i]], [[Alaska]], and the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name = WNW&gt;''Journal Information'', 21 {{smallcaps|Hastings W.-Nw. J. Envt'l L. &amp; Pol'y}} vii (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and overview ==
The journal was established in 1994 as a regional journal "that would contribute to an integrated understanding of environmental and natural resources policy."&lt;ref name = Gray&gt;Brian E. Gray, ''Dedication'', 14 {{smallcaps|Hastings W.-Nw. J. Envt'l L. &amp; Pol'y}} 29 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The founding editors had the goal of establishing an "interdisciplinary journal" that would feature "articles by legal scholars, practicing lawyers, biologists, economists, engineers, historians, hydrologists, land and resource managers, and other professionals."&lt;ref name = Gray/&gt; It was the first regional environmental law journal to focus specifically on issues involving [[California]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Philippine Laws and Jurisprudence Databank}}, [http://www.lawphil.net/legalink/zines.html/ Online Legal Publications: Hastings West-Northwest Journal of Environmental Law and Policy]; see also ''Introduction'', 3 {{smallcaps|Hastings W.-Nw. J. Envt'l L. &amp; Pol'y}} xi (1995-1996).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the journal primarily covers environmental law and policy, it also includes complimentary fields, including [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[regional planning]], [[engineering]], [[biology]], and [[Earth sciences]].&lt;ref name = WNW/&gt; The journal also features photography and other artwork relating to nature and the environment in California, Hawai'i, Alaska, and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref&gt;Brian King &amp; Michael Linder, ''Introduction'', 20 {{smallcaps|Hastings W.-Nw. J. Envt'l L. &amp; Pol'y}} iii (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the journal has published works of [[fiction]], [[poetry]], and other [[non-fiction]]. In 2008, the journal published an anthology of its "most important" articles to honor [[Joseph Sax]]'s award of the 2007 [[Blue Planet Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Visick, ''Introduction'', 14 {{smallcaps|Hastings W.-Nw. J. Envt'l L. &amp; Pol'y}} ii (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The journal has also been a sponsor of the annual California Water Law Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|California Water Law Symposium}}, [http://www.waterlawsymposium.com/seminars/ Past Symposia].&lt;/ref&gt; Rebranded in 2017, the journal is now known as the Hastings Environmental Law Journal.

== Impact ==
[[Washington and Lee University]]'s 2008-2015 Law Journal Rankings place the journal among the top thirty law journals that specialize in environmental, natural resources, and land use law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx "Law Journals: Submission and Ranking, 2008-2015,"] Washington &amp; Lee University (Accessed September 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Articles appearing in the journal have been cited by many [[state supreme courts]] in published decisions.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Cedar River Water and Sewer Dist. v.

The '''Home Rule City Act''' was enacted by the [[Michigan Legislature]] as ''Public Act 279 of 1909''. This [[statute]] provides the framework by which a new [[city]] may become [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] and provide for its own [[government]] by adopting a [[city charter]]. It also provides for the method by which an existing city may amend or revise its city charter.

==History==
Local units of government in the United States are created by the various states. Such [[local government]]s may go by various names in the several states. It is entirely possible for a state to totally abolish any or all local units of government. In the case of [[Michigan]], the state government is specifically restricted under the [[Michigan Constitution|state's constitution]] as to how it may interact with local governments and may not alter the boundaries of a local government without a vote by the affected residents. 

The Home Rule City Act resulted from the provisions of the 1908 [[Michigan Constitution|state constitution]], which called for [[home rule]] authority to be conferred upon the various local governments in the state. The 1963 state constitution retained these same home rule provisions.

Both constitutions recognized the fundamental integrity of [[county (United States)|counties]], [[civil township|townships]], [[city|cities]], and [[village]]s in Michigan. Local governments could no longer be created, abolished, or consolidated without the consent of the electors who reside within the affected territory. Prior to this time, local governments had been created by a special act of the legislature which did not require any consent from those living within the affected territory.

Under Michigan’s Revised Statutes of 1848, there were several classes of cities, the primary distinction among which was [[population]]. In nearly every case, however, it was the legislature that had provided a city charter for each city that mandated how each city was to be governed and how its officers were to be chosen. Under the Home Rule City Act, each city was given the ability to make changes to its city charter on its own. The charters that had been previously granted by the legislature continued in force until such time as an affected city took this action. All cities in Michigan are now classified under one class, namely, Home Rule Cities, regardless of the source or origin of the various provisions of their respective city charters.

==Revising or amending a city charter==
Under the Home Rule City Act, a city can amend its city charter by a vote of the electors residing within the city. An amendment can be proposed either by the governing body of the city, typically called the [[city council]], or by an [[initiative petition]] signed by a certain number of registered voters.

A revision of a city charter is a more comprehensive process which replaces the existing charter with a new one. The decision to revise a city charter must be approved by the voters of the city and can be proposed by the city council or by an initiative petition. A special commission is elected to conduct the work of writing a new charter and submitting it to the voters for approval. The commission is not bound to keep any provisions of the current city charter.

==Provisions of the act==
The Home Rule City Act specifies certain requirements that every city must contain within its city charter. At the same time, the Act provides for numerous optional charter provisions. In general, any power that is not specifically prohibited by another law for a city to exercise may be included in a city’s charter.

'''Insurance in the United Kingdom''', particularly long-term [[insurance]], is divided into different categories.  The categorisation is currently set out in sections 333B, and 431B to 431F of the [[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]] (ICTA) with each category of business given a different tax treatment. The [[Chartered Insurance Institute]] is a prominent professional group first chartered in 1913&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cii.co.uk/media/1756409/cii_future_risk_learning_from_history_final_web.pdf Future Risk: Learning from History. CII.]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Financial Services Authority]] was formed in 2001 as the regulator. In 2013 the [[Financial Services Authority]] was dissolved and [[financial regulation]] was instead placed with the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and [[Prudential Regulation Authority (United Kingdom)|Prudential Regulation Authority]].&lt;ref name=NewRegulators&gt;[http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2013/04/01/286594.htm UK’s New Regulators Take Over; FCA Now Responsible for Insurance Sector].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 2005, regulation of [[payment protection insurance]] was cited as a priority by UK's financial regulator;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/may/05/how-ppi-scandal-unfolded How the PPI scandal unfolded].&lt;/ref&gt; this scandal partially motivated the reorganization in regulatory agencies which occurred in 2013.&lt;ref name=NewRegulators/&gt;

==Categorisation==

===Life and non-life===

The first basic categorisation of long-term insurance is between life and non-life business. [[Life insurance]] business is insurance that is contingent on human life. Examples would include a policy that pays out £100,000 if the policy holder dies within a specified time; a policy that pays out £100,000 in 10 years time, but will pay out £101,000 if the policy holder dies before the policy matures; a pension in payment, which will end once the pensioner dies.

The main example of non-lifelong-term insurance business is permanent health insurance, but the category includes pensions management. Capital redemption business, which is business written for a premium in exchange for a payment of an annuity over a period of, say, 99 years, is also long-term non-life business. However, for taxation purposes, only capital redemption business written before 1 January 1938 is treated as non-life assurance business.

===Basic life assurance and general annuity business===
Basic life assurance and general annuity business is defined as being life assurance business not fitting within any other category of business under section 431F ICTA. It is often abbreviated to BLAGAB. BLAGAB is taxed on the so-called "I minus E basis" (i.e. the company is taxed on its investment return minus its expenses of management). The I minus E basis raises the UK Exchequer more revenue than it would get if it were taxed on a trading basis. This is because a trading computation would tax '''P'''remiums plus '''I'''nvestment return minus '''E'''xpenses minus '''C'''laims, and the expectation is that policy holder claims will be greater than the premiums they pay, as policy holders tend to hold life assurance policies as an investment that they hope will grow. To ensure the Exchequer does not lose out in a year where a trading basis would yield greater tax revenues, '''E''' (expenses of management) is restricted so the I minus E cannot be lower than the measure of trading profits, with any restricted E being carried forward and deemed to be E of the subsequent period.

Before 1 January 1992, there were separate tax computations for basic life assurance business and for general annuity business, since then the two categories have been combined into BLAGAB.

Capital redemption business written since 31 December 1937 has been treated as though it were BLAGAB from the first accounting period of a company ending on or after 1 July 1999. Before then, it was treated as a separate business taxed on an I minus E basis.

===Pension business===
The concept of pension business, in section 431B ICTA, was introduced in the Finance Act 1956, which was introduced as a tax-advantaged way of saving for retirement.  The tax advantage comes through taxing it on a trading profit basis rather than on an I minus E basis.  The precise definition of what it constitutes is closely defined by statute so that only schemes approved by the Government qualify for the tax advantages.  Pension business includes business relating both to the accrual of pension benefits whilst the policy holder is working and pensions in payment. Pension business includes reinsurance of pension business.

'''Background to Pensions:'''
Lifetime allowance: There is a limit on the value of retirement benefits that one can draw from the approved pension schemes before tax penalties apply.  That limit is called the lifetime allowance.

Introduced at A-day an individual is allowed to take benefits from their Pension up to the Lifetime allowance limit.  Any Benefits taken that exceed this Lifetime allowance will be subject to a tax charge.

A-DAY (26 April 2006): The changes were intended to make pensions less rigid and easier to understand, in a bid to encourage individuals to take control of their own pension Provision and to rationalise the British tax system as applied to pension schemes

'''Kinder der Landstrasse''' (literally: Children of the Country Road) was a project of the Swiss foundation [[Pro Juventute]], active from  1926 to 1973. The focus of the project was the assimilation of the itinerant [[Yeniche people#Switzerland|Yenish people]] in [[Switzerland]] by forcibly removing children from their parents, placing them in orphanages or foster homes. A  total of  about 590 children were affected by the program.&lt;ref name="uek-schlussbericht"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uek.ch/de/schlussbericht/Publikationen/Zusammenfassungenpdf/23d.pdf|title=Roma, Sinti und Jenische. Schweizerische Zigeunerpolitik zur Zeit des Nationalsozialismus. Beitrag zur Forschung (Veröffentlichungen der UEK, Band 23)|publisher=UEK, Swiss Government|author1=Thomas Huonker |author2=Regula Ludi |language=German|date=2001|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Temps'' (Geneva), December 12, 2007, "Le passé enfin écrit des enfants enlevés en Suisse", an historical study spanning the years from 1926 to 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1926, [[Pro Juventute]] started – supported by the federal authorities and official institutions – 
systematically taking children away from Yenish families living in Switzerland and placing them in foster homes, psychiatric hospitals and even prisons. This so-called "re-education" had the goal of establishing Yenish families, and particularly the next generation, in a 'sedentary' lifestyle. After 47 years of those unremitting activities, the affected people obtained in 1973, with the support of the media, an end to these practices.&lt;ref name="hds-Jenische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D8247.php|title=Jenische|publisher=HDS|author=Hansjörg Roth|language=German|date=2008-03-08|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As the legal basis of the forced separation of families and children served the Swiss Civil Code (''Zivilgesetzbuch'') of 1912, by – at misfeasance behavior of parents, permanent risk or, more generally, neglect – the guardianship authorities were empowered, parents to take away the custody of their children. Although the Civil Code mentioned a supervision over the work of the authorities, it was widely ignored. Although the welfare authorities possessed the right parents to escape custody, such as the supervision in the mass application of the laws of the article, was nowhere determined. Crucial and sufficient was the 'legal fact', that the children were members of a traveling (Yenish) family, and thus a sufficient reason, to take away the children from their parents.&lt;ref name="Thomas Huonker"&gt;Thomas Huonker: ''Ein dunkler Fleck. In: Merken was läuft. Rassismus im Visier''. [[Pestalozzianum]], Zürich 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-03755-105-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As a professionally-welfare justification generic psychiatric reports, which let the "Fund" the full control over his wards. The 'general scientific basis' for the attitude of those responsible functioneers was primarily the conviction of the harmfulness of family socialization "categorized as asocial families, as families who were traveling with origin per se". These fascist assumption informed at the same time in "hereditary biological notions of inferior 'genetic asocial material', whether sedentary or not, that will "damage the valuable heritage of the settled majority population, if its disclosure would not prevent."&lt;ref name="Thomas Huonker"/&gt;
 
Therefore, the "charity" was anxious to detain children, both not sedentary and sedentary families, propelled implement of origin or in foreign families. Not a real driving lifestyle of the parents was the decisive criterion of a child removal, but "belonging to a collective wearer as socially damaging properties classified fringe group of tinker, basketters, scissor sharpener, beggars, "or worse". In some cases, children have been taken away from their mothers immediately after birth. The children were housed usually in homes, in some cases also in foreign families, in psychiatric hospitals and in prisons or assigned as [[Child labour in Switzerland|forced child laborers]] to farming families. Contacts between children and parents were systematically prevented. Sometimes even the term of "charity ward" was changed to remain undetectable for their relatives. Child abuse was legitimized as education for work. In the 1930/40s the child removals peaked, resulting in more than 200 Yenish children under the control of "charity".&lt;ref name="UEK-Roma-Sinti-Jenische"/&gt;

Among the protagonists of such population sanitary and racial hygiene concepts, namely psychiatrist Josef Jörgerstraße ([[canton of Graubünden]] with his psychiatric-[[eugenic]] writings on the fictitious "Family Zero" or the German eugenicists and self-proclaimed "Gypsy expert" Robert Ritter. Federal Heinrich Haberlin, Board of Trustees President Pro Juventute, described the Yenish people in a brochure published in 1927 as "a dark spot in our culture on his order so proud Swiss countryside", which it applies to eliminate. The "charity" needed and found the support of dispensaries, teachers, pastors and non-profit organizations. The legislation opened maneuver, which were often but extensively used in different ways. The limits were exceeded to open illegality.&lt;ref name="Thomas Huonker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UEK-Roma-Sinti-Jenische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thata.ch/beiheftromasintijenische.htm#_ftnref136|title=Roma, Sinti und Jenische.

The scandal got in the even international focus before 1972, as the [[Beobachter]] newspaper's journalists investigated, after the newspaper got hints by affected Yenish people, and as the first media, Hans Caprez published on 15 April 1972 in the article ''Kinder der Landstrasse'' the facts and the background involving in all about 590 children of the [[Yenish people]] minority in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="beobachter-2007-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beobachter.ch/dossiers/dossier-fremdplatziert/artikel/kinder-der-landstrasse_der-kinderklau/|title="Kinder der Landstrasse": Der Kinderklau|publisher=[[Beobachter]] 1/2007|author1=Dominique Strebel |author2=Christoph Schilling |language=German|date=2007-01-03|accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and aftermath ==
In the aftermath of the project, it was intensively discussed and condemned in Switzerland, as well as in several books and movies.&lt;ref name="woz200923"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/0923/fahrende/zwischen-landstrasse-und-aktendeckeln|title=Fahrende: Zwischen "Landstrasse" und Aktendeckeln|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 23/2009|author=Dominik Gross|language=German|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public pressure prompted ''Pro Juventute'' then after, to dissolve the "Fund" in spring 1973: Remaining guardianships were abolished ''or transferred to other persons''. The Swiss authorities that had had co-initiated the "Fund" 37 years ago, was forced by the public disgust to pay financial compensation from 2000 to 7000 Swiss francs per victim. A prosecution of those responsible for the project, in particular of the two main actors Alfred Siegfried (1890-1972) and Clara Reust (1916-2000), as well as the person responsible in the guardianship authorities who did not fulfill their supervisory role, was never done.&lt;ref name="hds-kinderarbeit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D13909.php|title=Kinderarbeit|publisher=HDS|author=Thomas Guss|language=German|date=2009-10-13|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, for the first time, Yenish people were recognized as an independent ethnic group in the Canton of Bern, and since the 1980s, self-help organizations try to provide redress and rehabilitation of the slandered victims that even by pseudo-scientific programs were mistreated.&lt;ref name="hds-Jenische"/&gt;

The [[Genocide Convention|UN Genocide Convention]], signed on 9 December 1948, qualifies forcibly transferring of children of a "national, ethnic, racial or religious group to another group" in the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, as a [[genocide]].&lt;ref name="UN-1948convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voelkermordkonvention.de/|title=UNO-Konvention über die Verhütung und Bestrafung des Völkermords|publisher=[[United Nations]]|language=German|date=1948|accessdate=2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by the Swiss criminal law in general in ''Art. 264'' (''Strafgesetzbuch'') as ".... marked by their nationality, race, religion or ethnicity group".&lt;ref name="stgb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19370083/index.html#a264 |title= Art. 264 |publisher= Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft |work= Schweizerisches Strafgesetzbuch |language=German |date= |accessdate= 2014-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most relevant fact, whether the Yenish people are one of the groups the convention respectively Swiss law are attributable, is affirmed by parts of the recent scientific work,&lt;ref name="bar-Sablonier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bar.admin.ch/dokumentation/00445/01624/01630/01724/index.html?lang=de&amp;download=NHzLpZeg7t,lnp6I0NTU042l2Z6ln1acy4Zn4Z2qZpnO2Yuq2Z6gpJCDeH92e2ym162epYbg2c_JjKbNoKSn6A-- |title=Das Hilfswerk für die Kinder der Landstrasse.

Government redress was promised after years of public reparation, a proper rehabilitation and an apology by the Federal Council (''Bundesrat''), however not so far, and there only "emergency" payments were made at a ridiculously low level of each several thousand Swiss Francs to the meanwhile old-aged surviving victims of ''Kinder der Landstrasse''.

The foundation ''Naschet Jenische'' (literally: arise, Yenish!) was established in 1986, focussing on the refurbishment and 'reparations' of the injustice perpetrated against the Yenish (''Fahrende'') people in Switzerland, in particular by the program ''Kinder der Landstrasse''. In 1988 a fund commission, which regulated the inspection for the affected Yenish people, was established and completed their work in 1992.&lt;ref name="bar-Sablonier"/&gt; The inspection of the files of Pro Juventute is governed since then directly by the [[Swiss Federal Archives]] (''Bundesarchiv''). The affected Yenish people received in all 11 million Swiss Francs, but not more than 20,000 Swiss Francs each. The advice and support of people and families affected by ''Kinder der Landstrasse'' is still the main focus of the activities of the foundation. The foundation advises Yenish people in personal, family and social problems, in particular in contacts with the Swiss authorities, and assists in the inspection of personal files. The foundation also supports the search and the reuninicfaction of families. Yenish people are assisted with applications for financial assistance to public and private institutions. Advice can be also invoked in the case of difficulties with insurance and taxes. The consultancy activity is financed by ''Pro Juventute''. Another important part of the foundation's activities are the public relations; Naschet Jenische informs about the history and the current situation in Switzerland and arbitrates contacts.&lt;ref name="Naschet-Jenische"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stiftung-fahrende.ch/geschichte-gegenwart/de/organisationen/naschet-jenische|title=Naschet Jenische|publisher=stiftung-fahrende.ch|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Swiss national ''[[Wiedergutmachungsinitiative]]'' (reparation initiative) was tangentially related, althogh it primarily concerned 
the fates of the so-called ''[[Verdingkinder]]'' (literally: forced child laborers), another 'integration project' related to 'misplaced persons' which were placed as cheap labour at Swiss farms, among them also Yenish juveniles affected by "Kinder der Landstrasse", but not their families.&lt;ref name="wiedergutmachung-forderungen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiedergutmachung.ch/home/|title=Wiedergutmachungsinitiative|publisher=wiedergutmachung.ch|language=German|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyon's Inn''' was one of the [[Inns of Chancery]] attached to London's [[Inner Temple]]. Founded some time during or before the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], the Inn educated lawyers including [[Edward Coke]] and [[John Selden]], although it was never one of the larger Inns. It eventually developed into an institution of disrepute rather than of respect, and by the time it was dissolved in 1863 it was inhabited by only the worst lawyers.

==History==
It is believed that the Inns of Chancery evolved in tandem with the [[Inns of Court]]. During the 12th and 13th century the law was taught in the [[City of London]], primarily by the clergy. During the 13th century two events happened which destroyed this form of legal education - firstly a decree by [[Henry III of England]] that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and second a [[papal bull]] that prohibited the clergy from teaching the law.&lt;ref name=watt5/&gt; As a result the system of legal education fell apart, and the lawyers instead settled immediately outside the City of London as close as possible to [[Westminster Hall]], where the [[Magna Carta]] provided for a permanent court. This was the small village of [[Holborn]], where they inhabited "hostels" or "inns", which later took their name from the landlord of the Inn in question.&lt;ref name=watt5&gt;Watt (1928) P.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Inns of Chancery sprung up around the Inns of Court, and took their name and original purpose from the [[court of equity|chancery]] clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs.&lt;ref name=steel586&gt;Steel (1907) p.586&lt;/ref&gt; For several centuries, education at one of the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a [[barrister]]. A student would first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of [[moot court|moots]] and [[rote learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1928) P.9&lt;/ref&gt; Lyon's Inn was located near [[Wych Street]], and started off as a hostel "held at the sign of the [[lion|lyon]]". It was an Inn of Chancery from at least the time of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], although little more precise than that is known; records date from 1413.&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1907) p.590&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally purchased by the students and professors during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. Lyon's Inn was a small Inn, with eighty students at its peak during the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], and educated people as noted as [[Edward Coke|Sir Edward Coke]], Sir [[Lewes Lewkenor]] [[Master of the Ceremonies]] and [[John Selden]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce (1848) p.265&lt;/ref&gt; The Inn was, at the best of times, governed by a Treasurer and twelve "Ancients".{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Loftie (1895) p.284&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyon's Inn became a disreputable institution that "perished of public contempt long before it came to the hammer and the pick".&lt;ref name=s591&gt;Steel (1907) p.591&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls, and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients, neither of whom had any idea what their duties were, and the Inn had not dined for over a century.&lt;ref name=s591/&gt; The Inn was dissolved in 1863 and replaced with the third [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Loftie (1895) p.283&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malice murder''' is a [[criminal law|criminal offence]] in the US state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], committed when a [[homicide]] is done with express or implied [[Malice (law)|malice]].

==Definition==
Express malice is "that deliberate intention unlawfully to take the life of another human being which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof."  Malice is implied when "no considerable provocation appears and where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2014/title-16/chapter-5/article-1/section-16-5-1 2014 Georgia Code, § 16-5-1 - Murder; malice murder; felony murder; murder in the second degree, from Law.Justia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Justin Ross Harris]] of [[Marietta, Georgia]], was convicted in November 2016 of malice murder in the June 2014 death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Prosecutors argued that unhappily married and wanting an escape from family life, he intentionally killed his son by leaving him for about seven hours in the back seat of his vehicle outside the suburban Atlanta office in which he worked. Temperatures in the Atlanta area that day reached at least into the high 80s.  Investigators found evidence that he was engaging in online flirtations and in-person affairs with numerous women other than his wife, including a prostitute and an underage teenager. Harris was found guilty of all eight counts against him. In addition to malice murder and felony murder charges, he was also found guilty of sending sexual text messages to a teenage girl and sending her nude photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/nyregion/georgia-man-sentenced-to-life-without-parole-for-sons-death-in-hot-car.html|title=Georgia Man Sentenced to Life Without Parole for Son’s Death in Hot Car|last=The Associated Press|date=2016-12-05|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Manú Learning Centre''' ('''MLC''') is located within the [[Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]], a 643 hectare private [[nature reserve]], encompassed within the cultural zone of the [[Manú National Park|Manú Biosphere Reserve]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]] and one of the largest protected areas in [[Peru]]. It is home to a variety of [[tropical rainforest|rainforest types]] including lowland Andean, pre-montane, bamboo and high terrace forests. This geographical complexity creates habitats for a diversity of [[Rainforest#Flora and fauna|flora and fauna]].  The MLC is operated by the [[#CREES|CREES]] group, a non-profit and business collaboration working towards sustainability for the Manú Region.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/pdf/Manu.pdf | title = Manu National Park | accessdate = 2009-03-19 | last = UNEP | first = | date = 2008-09-20 | format = PDF | publisher = http://www.unep-wcmc.org | pages = 1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLC serves local schools and communities as well as international researchers and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.  It has hosted workshops for the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]], and on behalf of the Manú National Park Guards, as well as research projects from the [[University of Oxford]], [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]], and [[Glasgow University]] in addition to the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]].  The MLC has also worked alongside schools from the UK including [[Southbank International School]] and [[Tonbridge School]].

==History==
The MLC was built in 2004 on an abandoned [[hacienda]], the first to be developed in the region.  The initial concept was to demonstrate that it was possible to use novel land use techniques to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land and to empower and educate local communities throughout this process.  There is a large body of work that had been completed at the MLC incorporating aspects of [[biology]], [[geography]], [[zoology]], [[anthropology]], [[tropical agriculture]], [[politics]], and [[art]]. Specific projects have focused on [[reforestation]], mammal behaviour patterns, [[ecological footprint|human impact studies]], environmental management, monitoring of the [[blue headed macaw]] ([[CITES|CITES Red listed]]), [[Agricultural soil science#Soil Preservation|soil &amp; agricultural sustainability]], [[forest dynamics]], carbon offsetting, and the legitimacy of local power structures to name a handful.

==CREES==
CREES (Conservation, Research &amp; Education towards Environmental Sustainability) was established in 2003 prior to the construction of the MLC and the creation of Fundo Mascoitania. It is the only organisation to be in operation within the Manú region of Peru who regularly consults with local populations about their development priorities and leads the consequential local development projects.

==Access==
[[Image:Alto Madre from MLC.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alto Madre de Dios River from the Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]The MLC is accessible from [[Cusco]] by road until Atalaya and then by [[Launch(boat)|lancha]] until the port at the MLC.  During the [[dry season]] boats may not be able to navigate the river from Atalaya in which case transport is needed up until the Aguanos settlement on the opposite side of the [[Madre de Dios River|Alto Madre de Dios River]].  Crossing is then possible by raft or by lancha.

==Biodiversity and wildlife==
[[Image:Tropical Tree frog MLC.JPG|thumb|300px|Frog found in Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]

'''[[Clay lick#Clay licks|Macaw Collpa]]'''

The MLC reserve attracts an array of parrots and macaws thanks to the spectacular clay mineral lick, or [[Clay lick#Clay licks|Collpa]] carved out by the Alto Madre de Dios river. This collpa is the only one of its type in the zone, and is visited daily by hundreds of colourful and noisy parrots and macaws, the most notable of these being the Blue Headed Macaw. These in turn draw raptors such as the ornate hawk eagle and crested eagle.

'''Mammal Collpa'''

The MLC boasts two large mammal collpas which attracts smaller mammals as well as large groups of white-lipped peccary and their natural Jaguar predators.

'''Wildlife Monitoring Array'''

The MLC's wildlife monitoring array was established in 2005. The array comprises a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; monitoring grid mapped using GPS.  It provides a quantified area in which researchers can complete research on plants, animals and birds.

{{Homicide}}
A '''murder–suicide''' is an act in which an individual [[murder|kills one or more people]] before [[suicide|killing themselves]]. The combination of [[murder]] and [[suicide]] can take various forms, often linked to the first form:

* Murder linked with suicide of a mentally unstable{{clarification needed|date=April 2018}} person with a [[homicidal ideation]];
* Murder which entails suicide, such as [[suicide bombing]] or driving a car with one or more passenger(s) over a precipice;
* Suicide after murder to escape state punishment(s);
* Suicide after murder as a form of self-punishment due to guilt;
* Suicide after (or before) [[Proxy murder|murder by proxy]];
* Suicide after or during murder inflicted by others;
* Murder to receive a [[death sentence]] willfully;
* [[Suicide pact|Joint suicide]] in the form of [[murder|killing the other]] with consent, and then [[suicide|killing oneself]];
* Murder before suicide with the intent of preventing future pain and suffering of others including family members and oneself, such as a parent killing their children before ending their own life;

Suicide-lawful killing has three conceivable forms:
* To kill one's assailant through [[Right_of_self-defense|proportionate self-defense]] killing oneself in the process;
* Lawful killing to prevent an individual from causing harm to others, in so doing killing oneself;
* Lawful killing indirectly resulting in or contributing to suicide.

Many [[spree killing]]s have ended in suicide, such as in many [[school shooting]]s. Some cases of [[Mass_suicide#Religiously-motivated_suicides|religiously-motivated suicides]] may also involve murder.  All categorization amounts to forming somewhat arbitrary distinctions where relating to intention in the case of [[psychosis]], where the intention(s) is/are more likely than not to be irrational.  Ascertaining the legal intention ([[mens rea]]) is inapplicable to cases properly categorized as [[insanity]].

== Homicide and suicide theories ==
[[Image:Ajax suicide.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], son of [[Telamon]], preparing suicide. Reproduction from a black-figure amphora depiction by [[Exekias]] (550–525 BC).]]
According to the [[psychiatrist]] [[Karl A. Menninger]], murder and suicide are interchangeable acts – suicide sometimes forestalling murder, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saidwhat.co.uk/quotes/favourite/karl__menninger Karl Menninger quote]&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Freudian]] logic, severe repression of natural instincts due to early childhood abuse, may lead the [[death instinct]] to emerge in a twisted form.  The [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologist]] [[Ernest Becker]], whose theories on the human notion of death is strongly influenced by Freud,  views the fear of death as a universal phenomenon, a fear repressed in the unconscious and of which people are largely unaware.  

This fear can move individuals toward [[heroism]], but also to [[scapegoat]]ing. Failed attempts to achieve heroism, according to this view, can lead to [[mental illness]] and/or [[antisocial behavior]].&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0047-2352(99)00008-2| title = The psychology of suicide-murder and the death penalty| journal = Journal of Criminal Justice| volume = 27| issue = 4| pages = 361–370| year = 1999| last1 = Van Wormer | first1 = K.| last2 = Odiah | first2 = C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study specifically related to  murder–suicide, Milton Rosenbaum (1990) discovered the murder–suicide perpetrators to be vastly different from perpetrators of homicide alone.  Whereas murderer–suicides  were found to be highly depressed and overwhelmingly men, other murderers were not generally depressed and more likely to include women in their ranks.&lt;ref name="scribd" /&gt; In the U.S. the overwhelming number of cases are male-on-female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1556-4029.2010.01473.x| title = Murder Followed by Suicide: A Newspaper Surveillance Study Using the ''New York Times Index''| journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences| volume = 55| issue = 6| pages = 1592–1597| year = 2010| last1 = Warren-Gordon | first1 = K.| last2 = Byers | first2 = B. D.| last3 = Brodt | first3 = S. J.| last4 = Wartak | first4 = M.| last5 = Biskupski | first5 = B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around one-third of partner homicides end in the suicide of the perpetrator. From national and international data and interviews with family members of murder–suicide perpetrators, the following are the key predictors of murder–suicide: a history of substance abuse, the male partner some years older than the female partner, a break-up or pending break-up, a history of battering, and suicidal contemplation by the perpetrator.

Though there is no national tracking system for murder–suicides in the United States, medical studies into the phenomenon estimate between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths per year in the US,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2006.pdf American Roulette: Murder–Suicide in the United States. Violence Policy Center]&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority occurring between spouses or intimate partners and the vast majority of the perpetrators being male. Depression, marital or/and financial problems, and other problems are generally motivators.

Homicides which are later followed by suicide often make headline news; national statistics indicate 5% of all homicides are followed by suicide. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control reports&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/suicide-datasheet-a.PDF CDC Suicide, Facts At A Glance, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; that an estimated 1 million adults reported attempting suicide in 2011, and there were over 38,000 completed suicides in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_06.pdf National Vital Statistics Reports Volume 61, Number 6 October 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate of 624 murder-suicide events per year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vpc.org/studies/amroul2012.pdf Violence Policy Center, American Roulette, Murder-Suicide in The United States, Fourth Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that murders are associated with suicidal events (attempts and completions) only about 0.06% of the time.

In 18th-century Denmark, people wishing to commit suicide would sometimes commit murder in order to receive the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref name=denmark/&gt; They believed murder followed by [[repentance]] would allow them to end their life while avoiding [[damnation]].&lt;ref name=denmark/&gt;

The '''National Firearms Agreement''' (NFA), also sometimes called the '''National Agreement on Firearms''', the '''National Firearms Agreement and Buyback Program''', or the '''Nationwide Agreement on Firearms''',&lt;ref name=loc&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/firearms-control/australia.php | title=Firearms-Control Legislation and Policy: Australia | work=Library of Congress | accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an agreement concerning [[gun control|firearm control]] made by Australasian Police Ministers' Council (APMC) in 1996, in response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] that killed 35 people.&lt;ref name=nr&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425021/australia-gun-control-obama-america | title=Australia’s 1996 Gun Confiscation Didn’t Work – And it Wouldn’t Work in America | work=National Review | date=2 October 2015 | accessdate=14 December 2015 | author=Wright, Mark Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws to give effect to the Agreement were passed by Australian State governments only 12 days after the Port Arthur massacre.&lt;ref name=nym&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/how-australia-and-britain-tackled-gun-violence.html |title=How Australia and Britain Tackled Gun Violence |first=Margaret |last=Hartmann |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=2 October 2015 | accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFA placed tight control on semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons, although permitted their use by licensed individuals who required them for a purpose other than 'personal protection'. The act included a gun buy-back provision.

Negotiation and implementation of the Agreement was originally coordinated in 1996 by then-Prime Minister of Australia [[John Howard]].&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; Since then the Agreement has continued to have support from both Labor and Coalition Federal Governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=SSAA National |title=Australian Labor Party statement |journal=Capital News |date=November 2007 |url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/capital-news/2007/2007-11_asj-australian-labor-party-statement.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090921080908/http://www.ssaa.org.au/capital-news/2007/2007-11_asj-australian-labor-party-statement.html |archivedate=2009-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=SSAA National |title=Australian Labor Party statement |date=August 2010 |url=http://www.ssaa.org.au/capital-news/2010/2010-08-05_australian-labor-party-election-statement.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128173136/http://ssaa.org.au/capital-news/2010/2010-08-05_australian-labor-party-election-statement.html |archivedate=2010-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Police Ministers Council (APMC), comprising state and federal police ministers, meets at least every six months at which issues including the NFA are discussed. Changes to the NFA require the unanimous agreement of all governments. At a meeting on 21 October 2016 it was agreed to hold a [[firearm amnesty]] by mid-2017.&lt;ref&gt;The Age, 21 October 2016, [http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/states-fail-to-reach-agreement-on-classification-of-adler-shotgun-current-ban-remains-in-place-20161021-gs7pnx.html States fail to reach agreement on classification of Adler shotgun, current ban remains in place]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found that there were no [[mass shooting]] deaths of five or more in Australia from 1997 through 2006, though the authors note that it is impossible to prove the agreement was the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=S.|last2=Alpers|first2=P.|last3=Agho|first3=K.|last4=Jones|first4=M.|date=2006-12-01|title=Australia’s 1996 gun law reforms: faster falls in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a decade without mass shootings|url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/12/6/365|journal=Injury Prevention|language=en|volume=12|issue=6|pages=365–372|doi=10.1136/ip.2006.013714|issn=1353-8047|pmc=2704353|pmid=17170183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions==
The Agreement includes a number of provisions. It was agreed to establish a temporary [[gun buyback|firearm buyback]] program for firearms that were once legal now made illegal, that according to the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] bought over 650,000 firearms.&lt;ref name=nr/&gt; This program, which cost $230 million, was paid for by an increase in the country's taxes.&lt;ref name=nym/&gt;

The law created a national [[gun registry|firearm registry]], a 28-day waiting period for firearm sales, and tightened firearm licensing rules.&lt;ref name=ramzy&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/world/australia/australia-gun-ban-shooting.html | title=How a Conservative-Led Australia Ended Mass Killings | work=New York Times | date=5 December 2015 | accessdate=14 December 2015 | author=Ramzy, Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law requires anyone wishing to possess or use a firearm with some exceptions, be over the age of 12. Owners must be at least 18 years of age, have secure storage for their firearms and provide a "genuine reason" for doing so.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-35048251|title = Are Australia's gun laws the solution for the US?|work = BBC News|date = 9 December 2015|accessdate = 14 December 2015|author = Beck, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

In 1997, the Prime Minister appointed the Australian Institute of Criminology to monitor the effects of the gun buyback. The institute has published a number of papers reporting trends and statistics around gun ownership and gun crime, which it has found to be mostly related to illegally held firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi230.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074009/http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi230.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi151.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210161410/http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi151.html |archivedate=2015-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 report by the Australian Crime Commission said a conservative estimate was that there were 250,000 longarms and 10,000 handguns in the nation's illicit firearms market. The number of guns imported to Australia legally has also risen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/idiot-factor-drives-gun-crime-20130122-2d5bk.html|title='Idiot factor' drives gun crime|date=2013-01-23|access-date=2017-10-03|first1=Rachel|last1=Olding|first2=Nick|last2=Ralston|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 report stated that approximately "260,000 guns are on the Australian 'grey' or black markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/13/australia-has-250000-illegal-firearms-guns|title=Australia has 260,000 illegal firearms in circulation, inquiry told |access-date=2017-10-03|date=2014-10-13|first1=Birdie|last1=Jabour|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Philip Alpers of the [[University of Sydney]] found that Australia experienced 69 gun homicides in 1996 (not counting the Port Arthur massacre), compared to 30 in 2012.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The drop in firearm homicides was not attributed to the national firearms agreement. A 2006 study led by [[Simon Chapman (academic)|Simon Chapman]], also of the University of Sydney, found that after the NFA was passed, the country experienced more than a decade without mass shootings and accelerated falls in gun deaths, especially [[suicide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=S|last2=Alpers|first2=P|last3=Agho|first3=K|last4=Jones|first4=M|title=Australia's 1996 gun law reforms: faster falls in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a decade without mass shootings|journal=Injury Prevention|date=1 December 2006|volume=12|issue=6|pages=365–372|doi=10.1136/ip.2006.013714|pmid=17170183|pmc=2704353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samara McPhedran and Jeanine Baker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.cjcj.org/uploads/cjcj/documents/mass_shootings.pdf|title = Mass shootings in Australia and New Zealand: A descriptive study of incidence|last = McPhedran|first = Samara|date = 2011|journal = Justice Policy Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 5 February 2016|last2 = Baker|first2 = Jeanine}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers for gun lobby group Women in Shooting and Hunting (WiSH), considered whether the NFA had any effect in eliminating mass shootings by using New Zealand (a country with many similarities to Australia) as a comparison and found; “there is little support for the proposition that prohibiting certain types of firearms explains the absence of mass shootings in Australia since 1996”.

Another study by Baker and McPhedran in 2007 did not find a significant effect of the NFA on Australia's homicide rate. While research does show a steady decline in gun-related suicides, the reduction occurred at the same time as an overall reduction in the Australian suicide rate. What’s more, firearm-related suicides had been declining in Australia for nearly ten years before the 1996 restrictions on gun ownership.&lt;ref name=nr/&gt; A 2009 study also found that firearm suicide rates were decreasing in Australia before the NFA was passed, and concluded that "The implemented restrictions may not be responsible for the observed reductions in firearms suicide."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klieve|first1=Helen|last2=Barnes|first2=Michael|last3=De Leo|first3=Diego|title=Controlling firearms use in Australia: has the 1996 gun law reform produced the decrease in rates of suicide with this method?|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|date=4 October 2008|volume=44|issue=4|pages=285–292|doi=10.1007/s00127-008-0435-9|pmid=18839044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker and McPhedran's 2007 study has been criticized by [[David Hemenway]], who has written that the authors, who chose 1979 as the starting point for their trend analysis, failed to explain why they assumed the gun violence rate would continue to decline. Hemenway also criticized their study for using a [[counterfactual]] that assumed that this decline would continue forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jphp/journal/v30/n3/full/jphp200926a.html | title=How to find nothing | author=Hemenway, David | journal=Journal of Public Health Policy | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicide reduction from firearm regulation is disputed by Richard Harding in his 1981 book "Firearms and Violence in Australian Life"&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Richard (1981). Firearms and Violence in Australian Life. Perth: University of Western Australia Press. p. 119. {{ISBN|0 85564 190 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where, after reviewing Australian statistics, he said that "whatever arguments might be made for the limitation or regulation of the private ownership of firearms, suicide patterns do not constitute one of them" Harding quoted international analysis by Newton and Zimring&lt;ref&gt;Newton, George; Zimring, Franklin (1968). "Firearms and Violence in American Life" (PDF). Report Submitted to the National Commission on the Causes &amp; Prevention of Violence. Retrieved 8 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; of twenty developed countries which concluded at page 36 of their report; “cultural factors appear to affect suicide rates far more than the availability and use of firearms. Thus, suicide rates would not seem to be readily affected by making firearms less available."

University of Melbourne researchers Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi concluded their 2008 report, "There is little evidence to suggest that the Australian mandatory gun-buyback program had any significant effects on firearm homicides."&lt;ref&gt;http://c8.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/Lee%20and%20Suardi%202008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, a 2010 study by Andrew Leigh and Christine Neill found that, in the decade after the NFA, non-gun homicide rates fell by 59% and gun homicides fell by the same 59% with gun suicide rates falling by 65%.&lt;ref&gt;http://aler.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/2/509&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard cited this as showing Australia had been right to adopt the NFA but he omitted to mention the same fall in the non-gun homicide rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/08/02/did-gun-control-work-in-australia/|title=Did gun control work in Australia?|access-date=2017-10-03|date=2012-08-02|first1=Dylan|last1=Matthews|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued that alternative methods of suicide have been substituted. De Leo, Dwyer, Firman &amp; Neulinger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Leo|first1=D|last2=Dwyer|first2=J|last3=Firman|first3=D|last4=Neulinger|first4=K|title=Trends in hanging and firearm suicide rates in Australia: substitution of method?|journal=Suicide &amp; life-threatening behavior|date=2003|volume=33|issue=2|pages=151–64|pmid=12882416|doi=10.1521/suli.33.2.151.22775}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied suicide methods in men from 1979 to 1998 and found a rise in hanging suicides that started slightly before the fall in gun suicides. As hanging suicides rose at about the same rate as gun suicides fell, it is possible that there was some substitution of suicide methods. It has been noted that drawing strong conclusions about possible impacts of gun laws on suicides is challenging, because a number of suicide prevention programs were implemented from the mid-1990s onwards, and non-firearm suicides also began falling.&lt;ref&gt;http://bjc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/azl084v1&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study found that in the two years following the NFA's enactment, rates of [[armed robbery]] and attempted [[murder]] decreased significantly relative to rates of [[sexual assault]], but that the evidence was less clear with regard to changes in the rate of unarmed robbery following the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Benjamin|last2=Li|first2=Jing|title=Do fewer guns lead to less crime? Evidence from Australia|journal=International Review of Law and Economics|date=June 2015|volume=42|pages=72–78|doi=10.1016/j.irle.2015.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Samara McPhedran, a [[Griffith University]] academic, reviewed the literature on the NFA and homicide and reported that of the five studies she found on the topic, "No study found statistical evidence of any significant impact of the legislative changes on firearm homicide rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McPhedran|first1=Samara|title=A systematic review of quantitative evidence about the impacts of Australian legislative reform on firearm homicide|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|date=May 2016|volume=28|pages=64–72|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2016.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Chapman (academic)|Simon Chapman]] and colleagues reported in 2016 that there were no mass shootings in Australia between when the NFA became law and May 2016. The same study also found that "there was a more rapid decline in firearm deaths between 1997 and 2013 compared with before 1997 but also a decline in total nonfirearm suicide and homicide deaths of a greater magnitude." For this reason, the authors concluded that it was impossible to say definitively whether the reduction in firearm-related deaths can be attributed to the NFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=Simon|last2=Alpers|first2=Philip|last3=Jones|first3=Michael|title=Association Between Gun Law Reforms and Intentional Firearm Deaths in Australia, 1979-2013|journal=JAMA|date=22 June 2016|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.8752|volume=316|pages=291|pmid=27332876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the Anglo-Norman word still used as a tradition in law|the website|Oyez.org|the type of judicial commission|Oyer and terminer}}

'''Oyez''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|j|ɛ|z}}, {{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|j|eɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|j|ɛ|s}}, more rarely with the word stress at the beginning) is a traditional [[interjection]] said two or three times in succession to introduce the opening of a [[court of law]], especially in Great Britain. The interjection is also traditionally used by [[town crier]]s to attract the attention of the public to public proclamations.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;[http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/oyez American Heritage Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224100348/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/oyez |date=December 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oyez|title=Definition of OYEZ|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/oyez|title=Oyez definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/oyez?q=oyez|title=oyez - Definition of oyez in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 18th century, speaking [[English language|English]] in an English court of law was not required and one could instead use [[Law French]], a form of [[French language|French]] that evolved after the [[Norman Conquest]], when [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] became the language of the upper classes in [[England]]. ''Oyez'' descends from the Anglo-Norman ''oyez'', the plural [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of ''oyer'', from [[French language|French]] ''ouïr'', "to hear"; thus ''oyez'' means "hear ye" and was used as a call for silence and attention. It would have been common in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|medieval England]],&lt;ref name="yahoo1"/&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/gabarit_bdl.asp?id=4040|title=Banque de dépannage linguistique - Oyez|website=bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epochtimes.fr/moyen-age-a%E2%80%91t%E2%80%91il-invente-publicite-109517.html|title=Le Moyen Âge a‑t‑il inventé la publicité ?|date=8 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is still in use by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. At the beginning of each session, the Marshal of the Court announces: {{Blockquote|The Honorable, the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the Honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention, for the Court is now sitting. God save the United States and this Honorable Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/law-jan-june03-courthistory/|title=Supreme Court History|website=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/procedures.aspx | title=The Court and Its Procedures | accessdate=2014-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase is also in use in other federal courts, such as the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], the United States District Courts for the Southern District of Texas, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the Eastern District of Virginia, as well as the courts of [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Maryland]].

In addition to courts, the word, again repeated thrice, is used by the Common Crier of the City of London for all of the City's public proclamations most notably the Opening and Closing of the Common Halls for the Elections of Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs at Guildhall. His other duties include the reading of the proclamation [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|dissolving Parliament]] from the steps of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Traditionally, a proclamation is delivered to [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] from the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]], at which point it is given to the Common Crier, who proceeds to read it publicly.

'''Penology''' (from "penal", [[Latin]] ''[[poena]]'', "[[punishment]]" and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] suffix ''[[-logy|-logia]]'', "study of") is a sub-component of [[criminology]] that deals with the philosophy and practice&lt;ref name="Sharma1998"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rajendra Kumar Sharma |title=Criminology And Penology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pRJTw6EdtsC&amp;pg=RA2-PA1 |accessdate=2 March 2013 |date=1 January 1998 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |isbn=978-81-7156-754-6 |pages=2 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShohamBeck2007"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shlomo Giora Shoham |author2=Ori Beck |author3=Martin Kett |title=International Handbook of Penology and Criminal Justice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUICkjo8k1EC|accessdate=2 March 2013 |date=8 October 2007 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-4200-5388-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="林山田1992"&gt;{{cite book |author=林山田 |title=刑罰學 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLeIyEwkbL8C |accessdate=2 March 2013 |year=1992 |publisher=臺灣商務印書館 |isbn=978-957-05-0435-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; of various societies in their attempts to repress [[criminal]] activities, and satisfy public opinion via an appropriate treatment regime for persons convicted of criminal offences.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines penology as "the study of the punishment of crime and prison management," and in this sense it is equivalent with [[corrections]].&lt;ref name="Clear1994"&gt;{{cite book |author=Todd R. Clear |title=Harm in American penology: offenders, victims, and their communities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1GtSid5fvwC&amp;pg=PR15 |year=1994 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-2174-1 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penology is concerned with the effectiveness of those social processes devised and adopted for the prevention of [[crime]], via the repression or inhibition of criminal intent via the fear of [[punishment]]. The study of penology therefore deals with the treatment of [[prison]]ers  and the subsequent rehabilitation of convicted criminals. It also encompasses aspects of [[probation]] (rehabilitation of offenders in the community) as well as [[prison|penitentiary]] science relating to the secure detention and retraining of offenders committed to secure institutions.

Penology concerns many topics and theories, including those concerning [[prison]]s ([[prison reform]], [[prisoner abuse]], [[prisoners' rights]], and [[recidivism]]), as well as theories of the purposes of [[punishment]] ([[Deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[Retributive justice|retribution]], [[Incapacitation (penology)|incapacitation]] and [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]). Contemporary penology concerns itself mainly with criminal [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] and [[prison]] [[management]]. The word seldom applies to theories and practices of punishment in less formal environments such as [[parenting]], school and workplace correctional measures.

==History==
[[File:Cesare Beccaria in Dei delitti.jpg|thumb|[[Cesare Beccaria]], ''Dei delitti e delle pene'']]
[[File:Dei delitti e delle pene, edizione VI, frontespizio.jpg|thumb|''Dei delitti e delle pene'' (1766), frontpage, 6th edition.]]

Historical theories were based on the notion that [[fear]]ful consequences would discourage potential offenders. An example of this principle can be found in the [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draconian law]] of [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Bloody Code]] which persisted in [[English Renaissance|Renaissance England]], when (at various times) capital punishment was prescribed for over 200 offenses. Similarly, certain [[hudud]] offenses under Sharia [[hadith]] tradition may incur fearful penalties.

Modern theories of the punishment and rehabilitation of offenders are broadly based on principles articulated in the seminal pamphlet [[Dei delitti e delle pene|"On Crimes and Punishments"]] published by [[Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]] in 1764. They center on the concept of [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. In this respect, they differ from many previous systems of punishment, for example, England's Bloody Code, under which the penalty of theft had been the same regardless of the value stolen, giving rise to the English expression "It is as well to be hanged for a sheep or a lamb". Subsequent development of the ideas of Beccaria made non-lethal punishment more socially acceptable.{{clarify|date=October 2011}} Consequently, convicted prisoners had to be re-integrated into society when their punishment was complete.

Penologists have consequently evolved occupational and psychological education programs for offenders detained in prison, and a range of [[community service]] and [[probation]] orders which entail guidance and aftercare of the offender within the community. The importance of inflicting some measure of punishment on those persons who breach the law is however maintained in order to maintain [[social order]] and to moderate public [[Anger|outrage]] which might provoke appeals for [[cruel]] [[Revenge|vengeance]].{{clarify|date=October 2011}} 

In modern times Penology has shifted from a retributive based punishment to a form of community corrections. "Community corrections involves the management and supervision of offenders in the community. These offenders are serving court-imposed orders either as an alternative to imprisonment or as a condition of their release on parole from prison. This means they must report regularly to their community corrections officer and may have to participate in unpaid community work and rehabilitation programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corrections.vic.gov.au/home/community+corrections/|title=Community corrections|last=Justice|first=Corrections Prisons Parole, Department of|website=www.corrections.vic.gov.au|language=en-au|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23966">{{Usul al-fiqh}}
'''Principles of [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]''' otherwise known as '''''Uṣūl al-[[fiqh]]''''' ({{lang-ar|أصول الفقه}})  is the study and critical analysis of the origins, sources, and principles upon which Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') is based.

Traditionally four main sources ([[Qur’an]], [[Sunnah]], consensus (''[[Ijma]]''), analogical reason (''[[Qiyas]]'')) are analysed along with a number of secondary sources and principles.  

The main subject areas of discussion are these:
* General evidences and principles (''adillah ijmalliya wa al-qawaid'')
* Resolution of conflict and discrepancy (''ta'deel wa tarjeeh'')
* Determination of rules and adoption/emulation of rules (''ijtihad wa taqlid'')
* Islamic Law (''hukm shari'')

==Etymology==
''Uṣūl al-fiqh'' comprises the conjunction of two Arabic terms, ''uṣūl'' and ''fiqh''. ''Uṣūl'' is derived from the root letters [[hamza]], [[sad (letter)|sad]] and [[lām]] which refers to basis. ''Fiqh'' linguistically refers to knowledge, deep understanding or comprehension.

Technically the term is used to refer to the body of evidences and principles that Islamic jurists utilize to provide solutions to problems.

==Definition of the Science of Uşūl al-Fiqh==
The science of uşūl al-fiqh is a science in which such rules whose results are placed in ways of deduction of juristic precepts are discussed. For instance, performing the prayers (şalāt) is mandatory in Islam, and this Qur’ānic verse proves that obligation: “And that perform the prayers” (6, 72). However, denotation of the verse is dependent upon the imperative, like “perform” in that verse, being apparent in the obligation on the one hand and Qur’ānic apparent meanings being authoritative on the other. Those two issues are dealt with in the science of uşūl al-fiqh. Now, when the jurist learns through this science that the imperative is apparent in the obligation and that the Qur’ānic apparent meanings are authoritative proofs, he can infer from the said verse that the prayers is mandatory.&lt;ref name="Hodaee"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hodaee|first1=Alireza|title=An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence: A Shiite Approach|url=http://ijtihadnet.com/introduction-methodology-islamic-jurisprudence-shiite-approachpdf/|website=http://ijtihadnet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qur'an]] has always been regarded as the primary legal source of Islam, the speech of [[Allah]]. It has been transmitted through numerous chains (''mutawatir''). According to Roy Mottahedeh, "For over a thousand years the great majority of Muslim jurists agreed" that of the more than 6000 verses in the Qur'an, 500 have some legal content, most concerning [[ibadah]] (worship or religious ritual such as [[salat]] (prayer), [[hajj]] (pilgrimage), [[sawm]] (fasting), [[zakat]] (tithing)).   190 Qur'anic verses deal with some "aspects of the law" other than ibadah, but of these aspects "only matters of inheritance are laid out in any detail". &lt;ref name="Mottahedeh-intro-2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mottahedeh|first1=Roy|title=Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence|date=2003|publisher=Oneworld Publications. |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=elcQBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Principles+of+Islamic+jurisprudence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwionOylkLPaAhWqz4MKHeGwC6oQ6AEIUzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Principles%20of%20Islamic%20jurisprudence&amp;f=false |accessdate=11 April 2018 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For elaboration of the [[Quran]] or for clarification of a matter that is not mentioned in the Quran, these verses are supplemented by further revelation termed [[sunnah]]. Sunnah comprises explanations from Muhammad in terms of his speech, actions and silences which have been historically compiled and verified through chains of narrations called [[hadith]]s. Sunnah is second in prioritisation to Quran.

The Muslim [[jurists]] have found that some revelation has been captured through collective agreements expressed after the death of Muhammad through consensus of his companions which were transmitted over the ages. These are compiled as instances of consensus of the companions (''[[ijma al-sahaba]]'').

Therefore, the Qur’ān and the Sunnah are the two main sources of Islamic Legal Theory. However, the majority of jurists are of the view that Islamic law is based on four sources. 
* Ijmā‘ (consensus). It took the jurists considerable time to prove through the texts of the Qur’ān and the Sunnah that ijmā‘ is a valid source of law, and any that ḥukm (ruling) based on it should be accorded the status of the ḥukm of Allah . 
* Qiyās (analogy) was also successfully used to deduce the law from the Qur’ān and the Sunnah. The law deduced by Qiyās and ijmā‘ are actually dependent on evidence from the two main sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kayadibi |first1=Saim|title=Principles of Islamic Law and the Methods of Interpretation of the Texts (Uṣūl al-Fiqh) |date=2017|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|isbn=978 967 0526 33 1|pages=94 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when these failed to provide the authority sought did jurists resort to interpretation ''[[ijtihad]]''.

In the very early days of Islam Muslim authorities tended to rely on their own opinions to establish their interpretation of what a prescribed law should be for any given situation not founded on the Qur'an, a practice known as ''[[ra'y]]''.

The jurist [[ash-Shafi'i]], however, preferred to rely solely on traditions from Muhammad and thereafter on the method known as ''[[qiyas]]'' ([[analogy]]) where interpretations were to be derived from comparisons with relative subjects dealt with in the Qur'an or the traditions.

It is now the scholarly consensus, amongst both orientalist and traditional scholarship, that the following is a myth: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Once Shafi'i's school of law was fully established together with the other schools founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Malik]], the "door" of ''ijtihad'' was closed and it was considered that ''ijma'' had been reached on all necessary points of law (though the schools differ in many matters to this day but mostly on minor points of interpretation). Accordingly, Islamic jurisprudence has changed little for centuries and is based fundamentally on the four sources mentioned above. There is much debate and critique as to whether closing the gates of ijtihad was acceptable and whether it contributed to the intellectual and civislisational decline of the Muslims."{{cn|date=February 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wael Hallaq is widely credited for decisively discrediting this myth in the western world, whereas others such as Qasim Zaman continue to show how the Ulema continued to actively engage in Ijtihad. However, there is a valid debate over the degree to which the Ulema remained active in such endeavours ever since colonialism and modernity intruded Muslim lands. In fact, faced with such drastic change, there are certain cases that do show the Ulema to be initially dismissive of sociopolitical realities and hence lagging in their response- Nevertheless, eventually finding legal stratagems to solve dilemmas. A case in point is the issue of women's divorce in the time of Ashraf Ali Thanvi.&lt;ref&gt;http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/60731/1/fareehak_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Shi'a schools, they have continued with ''ijtihad'' to the present day. They however disputed the methodology of compilation of narrations of sunnah and also limited consensus of the companions to consensus of the family of Muhammad (''[[ijma]] [[ahl al-bayt]]'')

==The schools of thought==

The schools of [[Sunnite|Sunni]] Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them.  The [[Sunni]] schools (and where they are commonly found) are
*[[Hanbali]] ([[Saudi Arabia]] and parts of [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]])
*[[Hanafi]] ([[Turkey]], [[the Balkans]], [[Central Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[northwest China]] and [[Egypt]])
*[[Maliki]] ([[North Africa]], [[West Africa]], [[Sudan]] and several of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]])
*[[Shafi'i]] ([[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]], [[East Africa]], [[Yemen]], [[Somalia]] and southern parts of [[India]])
*[[Zahiri]] (minority communities in [[Morocco]] and [[Pakistan]])
*[[Qurtubi]] No longer exists
*[[Laythi]] No longer exists
*[[Awza'i]] No longer exists

The schools of [[Shia]] Islam comprise:
*[[Ja'fari]] ([[Iran]], [[Iraq]])
*[[Zaydi]]

The schools of [[Khawarij]] comprise:
*[[Ibadi]] ([[Oman]])

These schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular [[hadith]]s they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason ([[qiyas]]) in deciding difficulties.

== Principles within Sunni Islam ==
{{fiqh}}
* That which is necessary to achieve an obligation is obligatory
* That which leads to haram is haram
* Lesser of the two evils
* The doubt does not remove the certainty

Islamic law within the Sunni understanding draws from numerous sources. The most basic two sources {{spaced ndash}} indeed, the defining characteristics of Sunni Islam {{spaced ndash}} are the [[Qur'an]], believed by Muslims to be the literal word of [[God in Islam|God]], and the [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]] including the statements and actions of [[Muhammad]] passed down through historically verifiable [[Hadith|reports]]. [[Ijma|consensus]] is also accepted by Sunni Muslims, though there is much differing over its exact definition. [[Qiyas|Analogical reason]] is typically referred to as a fourth primary source by later and modern Muslim authors, though its exact definition and even validity are not unchallenged.

Beyond the four main sources, other methods such as [[Istihsan|juristic discretion]], [[Istislah|public welfare]] and [[Urf|local custom]] are often considered, though discussions regarding how these sources are to be applied is ongoing.

===The contribution of al-Shafi'i===
[[Al-Shafi'i]] documented a systematized set of principles, developing a cohesive procedure for legal [[Ijtihad|derivation of verdicts]]. His approach contrasted with the [[Hanafite]] methodology that determined the sources from the sayings and rulings of the companions and successors.  Furthermore, he raised the [[Sunnah]] to a place of prominence and restricted its legal use.  According to Shafi'i, only practices directly passed down from [[Muhammad]] were valid, eliminating the legitimacy of practices of Muhammad's followers.  Prior to Shafi'i, legal reasoning included personal reasoning thus suffering from inconsistency.  Shafi'i is probably best known for writing [[Al-Risala (book)|Risala]], a prime example of applying logic and order to Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islambasics.com/view.php?bkID=166&amp;chapter=5 |title=Usul Al Fiqh After Al Imam Al Shafi'i| accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Risala is considered a seminal work in the field of principles, it has been noted that the term "usul" is neither found in the title of the book nor is it used as such within the text.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"&gt;Stewart, pg. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of methods===
Between Shafi'i's Risala and the next attested works of usul is a gap of several hundred years. These later works were significantly different from Shafi'is book, likely due to the insertion of [[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]] and [[Ash'ari]]te theology into works of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=devin102&gt;[[Devin J. Stewart]], "Muhammad b. Dawud al-Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence." Taken from Studies in Islamic Law and Society Volume 15: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory. Edited by [[Bernard G. Weiss]]. Pg. 102. [[Leiden]]: 2002. [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between Shafi'i's work and these later works {{spaced ndash}} in terms of both content and the large chronological gap between which they were all composed {{spaced ndash}} is so great that modern scholarship has questioned the status of Shafi'i as the founder of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wael Hallaq]], ''Was al-Shafi‘i the Master Architect of Islamic Jurisprudence?'', [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], 4 (November 1993), pg. 587-605.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Makdisi, ''Juridical Theology'', pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Topics which became staples of written work on the principles of jurisprudence, such as reason versus revelation and interfaith debates regarding abrogation after revelation in Islam versus Judaism, were not even discussed by Shafi'i.

Indeed, even the division of the sources of Sunni law into four {{spaced ndash}} Qur'an, [[Sunnah|prophetic tradition]], [[Ijma|consensus]] and [[Qiyas|analogical reason]] {{spaced ndash}} was not present in Shafi'is books at all, despite Muslim scholarship generally attributing this division to him.&lt;ref&gt;"Does Shafi'i Have a Theory of 'Four Sources' of Law?, taken from the PhD dissertation of Joseph E. Lowry, ''The Legal-Theoretical Content of the Risala of Muhammad B. Idris al-Shafi'i'', [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Qadi al-Nu'man]], one of the earliest jurists to write about usul after Shafi'i did - perhaps during Shafi'is lifetime - was Abū 'Ubaid al-Qāsim b. Sallām, who actually considered the sources of law to consist of only three {{spaced ndash}} the Qur'an, the prophetic tradition, and consensus consisting of either scholarly consensus or consensus of the early generations.&lt;ref name="Stewart, pg. 105"/&gt; This division into four sources is most often attributed to later jurists upon whose work most Sunni jurisprudence has been modeled such as [[Al-Baqillani|Baqillani]] and [[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad]],&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq, A history of Islamic legal theories : an introduction to Sunnī uṣūl al-fiqh. Pg. 30-35. New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Ash'arite and Mu'tazilite schools respectively. Thus, the four main sources often attributed to Shafi'i evolved into popular usage long after his death.

Additionally, the later scholars of the four mainstream Sunni schools of law all increased beyond four sources; while the four sources are the most widely accepted, other practices such as the [[Fatwa]]s of the first generation of Muslims and the application of [[pure reason]] are not universally accepted.

===Application of sources===
Even after this evolution, there are still some disputes among Sunni [[jurists]] regarding these four sources and their application. [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] and in particular [[Dawud al-Zahiri]] rejected all forms of analogical reason in authentic narrations from them,&lt;ref name=ali280&gt;[[Chiragh Ali]], The Proposed Political, Legal and Social Reforms. Taken from Modernist Islam 1840-1940: A Sourcebook, pg. 280. Edited by [[Charles Kurzman]]. [[New York City]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mansoor&gt;Mansoor Moaddel, ''Islamic Modernism, Nationalism, and Fundamentalism: Episode and Discourse'', pg. 32. [[Chicago]]: [[University of Chicago Press]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuben Levy]], ''Introduction to the Sociology of Islam'', pg. 237, 239 and 245. [[London]]: Williams and Norgate, 1931-1933.&lt;/ref&gt; yet the later [[Maliki]]tes and [[Hanbali]]tes {{spaced ndash}} and in some cases, even [[Zahiri]]tes {{spaced ndash}} gravitated toward the acceptance of varying levels of analogical reason already accepted by [[Shafi'i]]tes and [[Hanafi]]tes.&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt; Malik and [[Abu Hanifa]] both accepted pure reason as a source of law; Ahmad and Shafi'i did not, and Shafi'i was especially hostile to [[Istihsan|juristic preference]] as implemented by Abu Hanifa, yet pure reason later found its way into all Sunni schools of law.

The question of consensus has evolved considerably. Abu Hanifa, Ahmad and Zahiri only accepted the consensus of the [[Sahaba|first generation]] of Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Muslehuddin, "Philosophy of Islamic Law and Orientalists," Kazi Publications, 1985, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farooq"&gt;Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq, "The Doctrine of Ijma: Is there a consensus?," June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; while Malik was willing to accept the consensus of the first generation in general or the consensus of later generations within the community of [[Medina]].&lt;ref name=mansoor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslehuddin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Shafi'i insinuated that consensus was not practically possible to confirm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Majid Khadduri]], Introduction to [[Al-Shafi'i]]'s [[Al-Risala (book)|al-Risala]], pg.33&lt;/ref&gt; Later scholars of all schools eventually followed the views of [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in expanding the definition of accepted consensus to include scholarly consensus and silent consensus as well.&lt;ref name="farooq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri, pg. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles within Shia Islam==
In [[Shi'a]] legal theory, analogical reason isn't recognised as a source of law; pure reason is, however.&lt;ref&gt;Moaddel, pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Shi'ites may differ in the exact application of principles depending on whether they follow the [[Ja'fari]], [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] or [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] subdivisions of Shi'ism.

===Ja'fari principles===

{{main article|Usul Fiqh in Ja'fari school}}
There are two interpretations of what constitutes sources of law among jurists of the Ja'fari school.

*According to the [[Akhbari]] view, the only sources of law are the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for.
*According to the majority [[Usuli]] view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for.  This process is known as [[ijtihad]], and the [['Aql|intellect]] is recognised as a source of law.  It differs from the Sunni [[qiyas]] in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported.

[[Javadi Amoli]] wrote about source of revelation in Shiism:
# The most important source in [[Shiite]] law is the [[Quran]] itself, which interprets itself 
# The other source is the tradition of the "infallibles" (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of the Muhammad as well as according to the [[Quran]] itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them.
# A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse.
# Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tasnim]] ([[tafsir]]), Vol 1, Page 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (''usul 'amaliyyah'') concerning factual probability.  An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.&lt;ref&gt;One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession.  Similarly Catholic moral theology distinguishes between "direct principles" and "reflex principles", the latter being the equivalent of [[Murtada al-Ansari]]'s ''usul 'amaliyyah''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of ''usul al-fiqh'', and was developed by [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]] (1706-1792) and Shaykh [[Murtada al-Ansari]] (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is the translation of [[Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr]]'s ''Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul''.

====Parts of the Shiite Uşūl al-Fiqh ====
Discussions of this science are presented in various parts in the works of uşūl al-fiqh. However, the best division is presented by al-Muhaqqiq al-Isfahani (d. 1940) in his last course of teaching (as narrated by his great student Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar in his Uşūl al-Fiqh, p. 11) according to which all uşūlī topics are discussed in the four following parts: Discussions of “terms,” of “intellectual implications,” of “the authority,” and of “practical principles.”
Discussions of terms deal with denotations and appearances of terms from a general aspect, such as appearance of the imperative in the obligation, that of the prohibition in the unlawfulness, and the like.
Discussions of intellectual implications survey implications of precepts even though such precepts may not be inferred from terms, such as discussing truthfulness of mutual implication of intellectual judgments and juristic precepts, of obligation of something necessitating obligation of its preliminaries (known as “the problem of preliminary of the mandatory act”), of obligation of something necessitating unlawfulness of its opposite (known as “the problem of the opposite”), of possibility of conjunction of the command and the prohibition, and so on.
Discussions of the authority investigate whether some specific thing is juristically treated as a proof; for instance, whether report of a single transmitter, appearances, appearances of the Quran, Sunna, consensus, intellect, and the like are authoritative proofs.
Discussions of practical principles deal with what the jurist refers to when he cannot find a persuasive proof, such as the principle of clearance from obligation, that of precaution, and so forth.
For more on this science, see [http://bayanbox.ir/download/7200445922802143481/Usul-Al-Fiqh.rar An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence(A Shiite Approach)]

===Ismaili principles===
Most early Ismaili works within the field of the principles of jurisprudence were actually responses to Sunni works on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, pg. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qadi al-Nu'man]]'s ''Differences Among the Schools of Law'' is most likely the first of such written responses.

The '''Reichsgericht''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁaɪçs.ɡəˌʁɪçt|lang}}, ''Imperial Court of Justice'') was the supreme criminal and civil court in the [[German Reich]] from 1879 to 1945. It was based in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. The Supreme Court was established when the [[Reichsjustizgesetze]] (Imperial Justice Laws) came into effect and it built a widely regarded body of jurisprudence during the period of the [[German Empire]] and [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court of Justice Celebrates 50th Anniversary", German Law Journal, November 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

During the rise of the [[Third Reich]], the Reichsgericht became deeply embroiled in the [[National Socialist]] agenda. It even involved itself in matters of [[Nazi]] Matrimonial and Contract Law before enactment of the [[Nuremberg Laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Fundstelle: ''Entscheidungen des Reichsgerichts in Zivilsachen'' p. 147, 65, 68&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the Nazi period it received criticism for the ease, and even willingness, with which it provided the highest level of formal legal justification for Nazi programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Federal Court of Justice Celebrates 50th Anniversary", German Law Journal, November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the end of [[World War II]] the Reichsgericht was dissolved, and reformed into the German High Court for the Unified Economic Region, the [[Allied occupation zones]] of France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Building==
Located in Leipzig, [[Saxony]], Germany, the building ({{lang-de|Reichsgerichtsgebäude}}) was designed by [[Ludwig Hoffmann (architect)|Ludwig Hoffmann]] and [[Peter Dybwad]], and construction was completed in 1895. It is designed in the [[renaissance architecture|Italian renaissance style]] and features two large courtyards, a central cupola and a large portico at the entrance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=reichsgericht-leipzig-germany Reichsgericht, Leipzig&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The rich decorative gable and sculptures are by [[Otto Lessing (sculptor)|Otto Lessing]]. After the reunification, the former Reichsgericht building  was renovated and became the seat of the [[Bundesverwaltungsgericht]] (Federal Administrative Court).

{{legend|#0088cc|Rome I Regulation, Rome Convention}}
{{legend|#ff6666|Rome Convention}}]]

The '''Rome I Regulation''' (Regulation (EC) No [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008R0593:EN:NOT 593/2008] of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations) is a [[regulation (European Union)|regulation]] which governs the [[choice of law]] in the European Union. It is based upon and replaces the [[Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations 1980]]. The Rome I Regulation can be distinguished from the [[Brussels Regime]] which determines which court can hear a given dispute, as opposed to which law it should apply. The regulation applies to all EU member states except Denmark, which has an [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-out]] from implementing regulations under the [[area of freedom, security and justice]]. The Danish government planned to join the regulation if a [[Danish European Union opt-outs referendum|referendum]] on 3 December 2015 approved converting its opt-out into an opt-in, but the proposal was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://stm.dk/_p_14120.html|title=Aftale om tilvalg af retsakter på området for retlige og indre anliggender|accessdate=2015-03-17|publisher=Danish Prime Minister's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://um.dk/en/news/newsdisplaypage/?newsID=DCB9FAA3-37A6-4673-989F-0C771B7CFAFE|title=Denmark to vote on Justice and Home Affairs opt-in model on 3 December|date=2015-08-21|accessdate=2015-08-21|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the United Kingdom originally opted-out of the regulation they subsequently decided to opt-in.&lt;ref&gt;Commission Decision of 22 December 2008 on the request from the United Kingdom to accept Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:010:0022:0022:en:PDF OJ L 10, 15.1.2009, p. 22])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The regulation sets out which law be used to interpret contracts with an international element (i.e. contracts agreed by parties in different countries).
Pursuant to its Articles 28 and 29, the regulation came into force on 17 December 2009 and applies to contracts concluded after that date (beginning 18 December 2009).

==Overview==
The broad principle of Rome I was not only to harmonise choice of law rules in contract but, subject to certain safeguards, maximise the freedom of the parties to choose the law governing their contractual relations.

===Exclusions===
Article 1 contains a list of exclusions from the scope of the Regulation.  These include:
# questions involving the status or legal capacity of natural persons;
# obligations relating  to family relationships (including maintenance obligations or matrimonial property regimes);
# [[negotiable instrument]]s such as [[bills of exchange]], [[cheque]]s and [[promissory note]]s;
# [[arbitration agreement]]s (which are regulated by the [[Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards|New York Convention]]) and [[jurisdiction clause|agreements on the choice of court]] (which are regulated by the [[Brussels Regime]]);
# matters of company law, including corporate capacity, winding-up and liability of directors and officers; 	
# matters of principal and agent;
# [[trust law]];
# pre-contractual obligations (which are regulated by the [[Rome II Regulation]]); and
# life insurance contracts.

===Freedom of choice===
Article 3 confirms the freedom of parties to choose the governing law of their contracts:
{{cquote|A contract shall be governed by the law chosen by the parties.}}
It also provides that the parties may agree to change the governing law, or to have [[Dépeçage|different laws govern different parts of the contract]].

===Absence of choice===
Article 4 deals with contracts where the parties have made no express or implied choice of governing law.  It provides broadly that:
# a contract for the sale of goods shall be governed by the law of the seller's habitual residence;
# a contract for the provision of services shall be governed by the law of the service provider's habitual residence;
# a contract relating to land or to a tenancy shall be governed by the law of the country where the property is situated;
# a franchise contract shall be governed by the law of the country where the franchisee has his habitual residence;
# a distribution contract shall be governed by the law of the country where the distributor has his habitual residence;
# a contract for the sale of goods by auction shall be governed by the law of the country where the auction takes place;
# a contract concluded within an exchange or multilateral system in accordance with non-discretionary rules and governed by a single law, shall be governed by that law.

===Employment contracts===
{{See also|Posted Workers Directive}}
Article 8(2), which supersedes article 6(1) of the 1980 Convention, says,

{{Cquote|To the extent that the law applicable to the individual employment contract has not been chosen by the parties, the contract shall be governed by the law of the country in which or, failing that, from which the employee habitually carries out his work in performance of the contract. The country where the work is habitually carried out shall not be deemed to have changed if he is temporarily employed in another country.}}

The significant change is that the applicable law is that of the country "from which the employee habitually carries out" his or her work. It is intended to cover workers such as airline pilots who might not work "in" any particular country, but work "from" a country.&lt;ref&gt;UK law had in fact already adopted such a position, ''[[Lawson v Serco Ltd]]'' [2006] IRLR 289&lt;/ref&gt;

For a temporary worker posted in another country from her home country, article 8(2) makes the law of the home country apply. It would therefore appear that, for example, the employer of a Greek posted worker in Germany could rely on the lesser protections of Greek law. Article 7(2) of the 1980 Convention stated that 'Nothing in this Convention shall restrict the application of the rules of the law of the forum in a situation where they are mandatory irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract'. Employment law is mandatory. However, article 7(2) was not retained in the Rome I Regulation. The replacement, article 9 defines mandatory provisions as,

{{Cquote|provisions the respect for which is regarded as crucial by a country for safeguarding its public interests, such as its political, social or economic organisation, to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract under this Regulation.}}

It is clear that employment law is applicable in any situation to a contract falling within its scope, though some have insisted, sceptically, that employment law may not be "crucial" in this sense, following older case law of the ECJ.&lt;ref&gt;C Barnard, 'The UK and Posted Workers' (2009) 38 ILJ 122, and ''[[Arblade]]'' [1999] ECR I-8453 (C-369/96)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mandatory provisions===
Article 9 states that:

{{Cquote|1. Overriding mandatory provisions are provisions the respect for which is regarded as crucial by a country for safeguarding its public interests, such as its political, social or economic organisation, to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the contract under this Regulation.

2. Nothing in this Regulation shall restrict the application of the overriding mandatory provisions of the law of [[lex fori|the forum]].}}

===Scope of applicable law===
Article 12 provides that the applicable law shall govern:
# interpretation;
# performance;
# the consequences of a total or partial breach of obligations, including the assessment of damages;
# the various ways of extinguishing obligations, and prescription and limitation of actions;
# the consequences of nullity of the contract.

However, in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance, regard must be had to the law of the country in which performance takes place.

===Assignment and subrogation===
The relationship between an assignor and an assignee under an [[assignment (law)|assignment]] or contractual rights (including by way of security) against another obligor under the original contract is governed by the applicable law of the contract of assignment.&lt;ref&gt;Article 14(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the applicable law of the original agreement (under which rights are being assigned) will determine if those rights are assignable, and what the relationship between the assignee and the obligor is.

One of the criticisms of Rome I is that it does not address the problems caused by successive assignments (by way of security or absolutely) and the determination of priorities between subsequent assignees.  Further consultations were intended in relation to these issues, and those consultations have suggested alternative possibilities, but no definitive solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeanlawblog.eu/2012/06/01/rome-i-and-third-party-aspects-of-voluntary-assignment/|title=ROME I AND THIRD-PARTY ASPECTS OF VOLUNTARY ASSIGNMENT|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar rules apply to transfers of contractual rights by way of [[subrogation]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 14(2)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not a right of subrogation arises as a matter of law depends upon the applicable law between the parties between whom the subrogation operates, and not the contract in relation to which the rights are subrogated.&lt;ref&gt;Article 15&lt;/ref&gt;  So, for example: Mr X deposits property with Mr Y under a contract of bailment governed by German law, and during that period that property is damaged.  Mr X claims under his policy of insurance governed by English law with Z Co, who pays the claim.  It will be a matter of English law whether Z Co is subrogated to any right of action which Mr X might have had against Mr Y under the original contract of bailment.

===Set-off===
Article 17 provides that "the right to [[set-off (law)|set-off]] is not agreed by the parties, set-off shall be governed by the law applicable to the claim against which the right to set-off is asserted."  This is potentially problematic, as by definition set-off deals with two separate claims.  It seems that set-off is to be viewed defensively with respect to each claim, which creates the possibility of asymmetric application (i.e. set-off might operate to partly extinguish a German law claim, but not partly extinguish the Spanish claim which is relied upon to do so).  The better view would presumably be that the set-off must be operative under each governing law to be effective under either.

===Burden of proof===
Although procedural matters are largely excluded from Rome I, Article 18 does state that where an applicable law raises presumptions (such as the [[presumption of advancement]]) or specifies the burden of proof, then those rules shall apply to the contractual obligations.

===Renvoi===
Article 20 excludes the application of the doctrine of ''[[renvoi]]'' in relation to contracts.

===Public policy===
Article 21 provides:

{{cquote|The application of a provision of the law of any country specified by this Regulation may be refused only if such application is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (''[[ordre public]]'') of the forum.}}

'''''Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co.''''', 312 U.S. 1 (1941), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] in which the Court held that under [[United States|American]] law important and substantial [[Procedural law|procedures]] are not substantive, rather they are still considered [[Procedural law|procedural]], and federal law applies.

This was a post-''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins|Erie]]'' decision, and thus the decision whether to apply the law of the state of jurisdiction or uniform federal rules depended on whether the rule in question was procedural or substantive in nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2096">[[Taxation]] in the [[Faroe Islands]] has differed from the taxes in [[Denmark]] since home rule was granted in 1948. This gives the Faroe Islands control over their own taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nordisketax.net/country.asp?url=/files/far/eng.asp|title=Faroe Islands|author=Nordisk eTax|work=nordisketax.net|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Income taxation==

All citizens of the [[Faroe Islands]] are subject to personal taxation. The government tax rate on incomes up to DKK 500,000 is 20%. Incomes higher than this pay a fixed amount, always resulting in a higher percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euraxess.fo/index.php?id=35|title=Taxation|work=euraxess.fo|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple tax deductions in the Faroes. This includes a 14% deduction for fishermen. However, this is limited to 14% of DKK 470,000 corresponding to a maximum annual deduction of DKK 65,800.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faroeislands.fo/economy-business/|title=Economy and Business in the Faroe Islands|website=faroeislands.fo|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deduction for foreign workers also exists, and this deduction can be as high as 30%. Deductions are also available to students and parents.

==VAT and business taxes==

The [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] or Value Added Tax, is a tax on imports and sales paid to the Faroese treasury.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The VAT is deductible for income purposes. Companies that don't pay a VAT must pay an employer's tax. The corporate tax rate in the [[Faroe Islands]] stands at 18%.

==Tax administration==

Citizens subject to taxation use the calendar year as the income tax/fiscal year. Generally, the income period for companies follows the accounting year, which has to be no longer than 12 months. However, the first accounting year can vary from 6 to 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faroelaw.fo/get.file?ID=3176 |title=Data|website=faroelaw.fo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Estates''' or the '''States''' ({{lang-fr|États}}, {{lang-de|Landstände}}, {{lang-nl|Staten}}) was the assembly of the representatives of the '''[[estates of the realm]]''', the divisions of society in [[feudalism|feudal]] times, called together for purposes of deliberation, [[legislation]] or [[taxation]]. A meeting of the estates that covered an entire kingdom was called an '''[[States-General (disambiguation)|estates general]]'''.

The first estate was the [[clergy]], the second the [[nobility]] and the third the [[commoner]]s, although actual membership in the third estate varied from country to country.&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;Gordon Griffiths, [http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195064933.001.0001/acref-9780195064933-e-0484 "Estates-general"], in Hans J. Hillebrand (ed.), ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Reformation'' (Oxford University Press, 2005 [1996]). Retrieved 29 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Bourgeoisie, peasants and people with no estate from birth were separated in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] as late as in 1905.

Representation through estates was the norm in Europe until the advent of  popular representation beginning with the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Estate&gt;"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198601753.001.0001/acref-9780198601753-e-1285 Estate or (Latin) ''status'' or (Dutch) ''staat'' or (French) ''état'' or (German) ''Stand'' or (Italian) ''stato'']," in Gordon Campbell (ed.), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 2005 [2003]). Retrieved 29 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Estates General (France)|Estates General of France]] were convoked only twice between 1614 and 1789, both times during the [[Fronde]] (1648–53) and in neither case did they actually meet. At the [[Estates General of 1789 in France|final meeting of the Estates in 1789]], they voted to join together in a single [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], generally seen as marking the start of the Revolution.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt; Still, Estates continued to meet in [[Navarre]] until 1828, in [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] until 1848, in Sweden until 1866 and in the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg]] until 1918.&lt;ref name=Estate/&gt;

In some countries, the parliament kept the same name when its feudal organization was replaced with a more modern kind of representation, like census or universal [[suffrage]]. In Sweden, the [[Riksdag of the Estates]] was replaced with the [[Riksdag]] in 1866.

'''Unemployment benefits''' (depending on the jurisdiction also called '''unemployment insurance''' or '''unemployment compensation''') are payments made by back authorized bodies to [[unemployment|unemployed]] people. In the United States, benefits are funded by a compulsory governmental insurance system, not taxes on individual citizens. Depending on the jurisdiction and the status of the person, those sums may be small, covering only basic needs, or may compensate the lost time proportionally to the previous earned salary.

Unemployment benefits are generally given only to those registering as unemployed, and often on conditions ensuring that they seek work and do not currently have a job, and are validated as being laid off and not fired for cause in most states.

==History==
[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Leaflet promoting the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].]]
The first unemployment benefit scheme was introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] with the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] government of [[H. H. Asquith]]. The popular measures were to combat the increasing influence of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] among the country's working-class population. The Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment. It only applied to wage earners, however, and their families and the unwaged had to rely on other sources of support, if any.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/national-health-insurance.htm The Cabinet Papers 1915-1982: National Health Insurance Act 1911.] The National Archives, 2013. Retrieved 30 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures in the implementation of the Act included [[Robert Laurie Morant]], and William Braithwaite.

By the time of its implementation, the benefit was criticized by communists, who thought such insurance would prevent workers from starting a revolution, while employers and [[Tory|tories]] saw it as a "necessary evil".&lt;ref name="bogardus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogardus|first1=Emory S.|authorlink1=Emory S.

The scheme was based on [[actuary|actuarial]] principles and it was funded by a fixed amount each from workers, employers, and taxpayers. It was restricted to particular industries, particularly more volatile ones like shipbuilding, and did not make provision for any dependants. After one week of unemployment, the worker was eligible for receiving 7 shillings/week for up to 15 weeks in a year. By 1913, 2.3 million were insured under the scheme for unemployment benefit.

===Expansion and spread===
The [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] created the dole system of payments for unemployed workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. R. Garside|title=British Unemployment 1919-1939: A Study in Public Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TIp3oq398IC&amp;pg=PA37|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=37|isbn=9780521892544}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dole system provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to over 11 million workers—practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, railroad men, and civil servants.

Unemployment benefits were introduced in Germany in 1927, and in most European countries in the period after the [[Second World War]] with the expansion of the [[welfare state]]. Unemployment insurance in the United States originated in [[Wisconsin]] in 1932.&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 213"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph F. |title= ''State and Local Government'' |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |location=New York, NY |isbn= | pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the [[Social Security Act]] of 1935, the [[federal government of the United States]] effectively encouraged the individual states to adopt unemployment insurance plans.

==Argentina==
In [[Argentina]], successive administrations have used a variety of passive and active labour market interventions to protect workers against the consequences of economic shocks. The government's key institutional response to combat the increase in [[poverty]] and unemployment created by the crisis{{clarify|which crisis? when?|date=November 2017}} was the launch of an active unemployment assistance programme called Plan Jefas y Jefes de Hogar Desocupados (Program for Unemployed Heads of Households).

==Australia==
{{Main article|Social Security (Australia)}}
In [[Australia]], social security benefits, including unemployment benefits, are funded through the taxation system. There is no compulsory national unemployment insurance fund. Rather, benefits are funded in the annual Federal Budget by the National Treasury and are administrated and distributed throughout the nation by the government agency, [[Centrelink]]. Benefit rates are indexed to the Consumer Price Index and are adjusted twice a year according to inflation or deflation.

There are two types of payment available to those experiencing unemployment. The first, called Youth Allowance, is paid to young people aged 16–20 (or 15, if deemed to meet the criteria for being considered 'independent' by Centrelink). Youth Allowance is also paid to full-time students aged 16–24, and to full-time Australian Apprenticeship workers aged 16–24. People aged below 18 who have not completed their High School education, are usually required to be in full-time education, undertaking an apprenticeship or doing training to be eligible for Youth Allowance. For single people under 18 years of age living with a parent or parents the basic rate is [[Australian dollar|A$]]91.60 per week. For over-18- to 20-year-olds living at home this increases to A$110.15 per week. For those aged 18–20 not living at home the rate is A$167.35 per week. There are special rates for those with partners and/or children.

The second kind of payment is called Newstart Allowance and is paid to unemployed people over the age of 21 and under the pension eligibility age. To receive a Newstart payment, recipients must be unemployed, be prepared to enter into an Employment Pathway Plan (previously called an Activity Agreement) by which they agree to undertake certain activities to increase their opportunities for employment, be Australian Residents and satisfy the income test (which limits weekly income to A$32 per week before benefits begin to reduce, until one's income reaches A$397.42 per week at which point no unemployment benefits are paid) and the assets test (an eligible recipient can have assets of up to A$161,500 if he or she owns a home before the allowance begins to reduce and $278,500 if he or she does do not own a home). The rate of Newstart allowance as at 12 January 2010 for single people without children is A$228 per week, paid fortnightly. (This does not include supplemental payments such as Rent Assistance.) Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children.

Effectively, people have had to survive on $39 a day from Newstart since 1994, and there have been calls to raise this by politicians and NGO groups.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.9news.com.au/national/2018/05/09/14/31/john-howard-joins-calls-for-newstart-boost&lt;/ref&gt;

The system in Australia is designed to support recipients no matter how long they have been unemployed. In recent years the former [[Australian Liberal Party|Coalition]] government under [[John Howard]] has increased the requirements of the Activity Agreement, providing for controversial schemes such as [[Work for the Dole]], which requires that people on benefits for 6 months or longer work voluntarily for a community organisation regardless of whether such work increases their skills or job prospects. Since the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government under [[Kevin Rudd]] was elected in 2008, the length of unemployment before one is required to fulfill the requirements of the Activity Agreement (which has been renamed the Employment Pathway Plan) has increased from six to twelve months. There are other options available as alternatives to the Work for the Dole scheme, such as undertaking part-time work or study and training, the basic premise of the Employment Pathway Plan being to keep the welfare recipient active and involved in seeking full-time work.

For people renting their accommodation, unemployment benefits are supplemented by Rent Assistance, which, for single people as at 29 June 2012, begins to be paid when weekly rent is more than A$53.40. Rent Assistance is paid as a proportion of total rent paid (75 cents per dollar paid over $53.40 up to the maximum). The maximum amount of rent assistance payable is A$60.10 per week, and is paid when the total weekly rent exceeds A$133.54 per week. Different rates apply to people with partners and/or children, or who are sharing accommodation.

==Canada==
In [[Canada]], the system now known as Employment Insurance was formerly called [[Unemployment Insurance]]. The name was changed in 1996, in order to alleviate perceived negative connotations. In 2015, Canadian workers pay premiums of 1.62%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/pyrll/clcltng/ei/cnt-chrt-pf-eng.html|title=EI premium rates and maximums|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Canada Revenue Agency|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of insured earnings in return for benefits if they lose their jobs.

The [[Employment and Social Insurance Act]] was passed in 1935 during the [[Great Depression]] by the government of [[R.B. Bennett]] as an attempted Canadian unemployment insurance programme. It was, however, ruled unconstitutional by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] as unemployment was judged to be an insurance matter falling under provincial responsibility. After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to "Unemployment Insurance" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the [[Constitution Act, 1867]], and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940. Because of these problems Canada was the last major Western country to bring in an employment insurance system. It was extended dramatically by [[Pierre Trudeau]] in 1971 making it much easier to get. The system was sometimes called the 10/42, because one had to work for 10 weeks to get benefits for the other 42 weeks of the year. It was also in 1971 that the UI program was first opened up to maternity and sickness benefits, for 15 weeks in each case.

The generosity of the Canadian UI programme was progressively reduced after the adoption of the 1971 UI Act. At the same time, the federal government gradually reduced its financial contribution, eliminating it entirely by 1990. The EI system was again cut by the Progressive Conservatives in 1990 and 1993, then by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] in 1994 and 1996. Amendments made it harder to qualify by increasing the time needed to be worked, although seasonal claimants (who work long hours over short periods) turned out to gain from the replacement, in 1996, of weeks by hours to qualify. The ratio of beneficiaries to unemployed, after having stood at around 40 percent for many years, rose somewhat during the 2009 recession but then fell back again to the low 40s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/ei/reports/mar2012/index.shtml |title= 2012 EI Monitoring and Assessment Report (Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, March 2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unemployed persons are not covered for benefits (e.g. self-employed workers), while others may have exhausted their benefits, did not work long enough to qualify, or quit or were dismissed from their job. The length of time one could take EI has also been cut repeatedly. The 1994 and 1996 changes contributed to a sharp fall in Liberal support in the Atlantic provinces in the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|1997 election]].

In 2001, the federal government increased parental leave from 10 to 35 weeks, which was added to preexisting maternity benefits of 15 weeks. In 2004, it allowed workers to take EI for compassionate care leave while caring for a dying relative, although the strict conditions imposed make this a little used benefit. In 2006, the Province of Quebec opted out of the federal EI scheme in respect of maternity, parental and adoption benefits, in order to provide more generous benefits for all workers in that province, including self-employed workers. Total EI spending was $19.677 billion for 2011-2012 (figures in [[Canadian dollar]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/cpc-pac/2012/index-eng.html |title= Public Accounts of Canada for 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers contribute 1.4 times the amount of employee premiums. Since 1990, there is no government contribution to this fund. The amount a person receives and how long they can stay on EI varies with their previous salary, how long they were working, and the unemployment rate in their area. The EI system is managed by [[Service Canada]], a service delivery network reporting to the Minister of [[Employment and Social Development Canada]].

A bit over half of EI benefits are paid in Ontario and the Western provinces but EI is especially important in the Atlantic provinces, which have higher rates of unemployment. Many Atlantic workers are also employed in seasonal work such as fishing, forestry or tourism and go on EI over the winter when there is no work. There are special rules for fishermen making it easier for them to collect EI. EI also pays for [[Parental leave|maternity and parental leave]], [[compassionate care leave]], and illness coverage. The programme also pays for retraining programmes (EI Part II) through labour market agreements with the Canadian provinces.

A significant part of the federal fiscal surplus of the [[Jean Chrétien]] and [[Paul Martin]] years came from the EI system. Premiums were reduced much less than falling expenditures - producing, from 1994 onwards, EI surpluses of several billion dollars per year, which were added to general government revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 14(Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cumulative EI surplus stood at $57 billion at 31 March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/recgen/pdf/49-eng.pdf |title= Public Accounts of Canada, 2008, page 4.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly four times the amount needed to cover the extra costs paid during a recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.actuaries.ca/members/publications/2007/207111e.pdf |title= A Look Back and A Way Forward: Actuarial Views on the Future of the Employment Insurance System, page 8 (Canadian Institute of Actuaries, Nov. 2007)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew criticism from Opposition parties and from business and labour groups, and has remained a recurring issue of the public debate. The [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/committee/381/huma/reports/rp1624652/humarp03/humarp03-e.pdf |title= Restoring Financial Governance and Accessibility n the Employment Insurance Program - Report of the Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills Development, Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, page 59: Dissenting Opinion, Conservative Party of Canada - Peter Van Loan, M.P., York-Simcoe - CPC HRSDC Critic - February 09, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; chose not to recognize those EI surpluses after [[Canadian federal election, 2006|being elected in 2006]]. Instead, the Conservative government cancelled the EI surpluses entirely in 2010, and required EI contributors to make up the 2009, 2010 and 2011 annual deficits by increasing EI premiums. On 11 December 2008, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] rejected a court challenge launched against the federal government by two Quebec unions, who argued that EI funds had been misappropriated by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2008/2008scc68/2008scc68.html |title= Text of judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada on Employment Insurance surpluses - Confédération des syndicats nationaux v.

The level of benefit is set between the minimum wage and the minimum living allowance by individual [[Province (China)|provinces]], [[autonomous regions]] and [[Municipality (China)|municipalities]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Denmark==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Denmark}}
==European Union==
{{See also|European unemployment insurance}}
Each Member State of the European Union has its own system and in general a worker should claim unemployment benefits in the country where they last worked. For a person working in a country other than their country of residency (a cross-border worker), they will have to claim benefits in their country of residence.&lt;ref name="europa"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/unemployment-and-benefits/social-security/index_en.htm |title= Social security systems in the EU |website=Europa |date= 21 Mar 2018 |accessdate= 5 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finland==
Two systems run in parallel, combining a [[Ghent system]] and a minimum level of support provided by [[Kela (Finnish)|Kela]], an agency of the national government. Unionization rates are high (70%), and union membership comes with membership in an unemployment fund. Additionally, there are non-union unemployment funds. Usually benefits require 26 weeks of 18 hours per week on average, and the unemployment benefit is 60% of the salary and lasts for 500 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preconditions of earnings-related daily allowancet|url=http://en.ytk.fi/benefits-abc/preconditions-of-earnings-related-daily-allowance/other-preconditions|publisher=YTK|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this is not available, Kela can pay either regular unemployment benefit or labor market subsidy benefits. The former requires a degree and two years of full-time work. The latter requires participation in training, education, or other employment support, which may be mandated on pain of losing the benefit, but may be paid after the regular benefits have been either maxed out or not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unemployment|url=http://www.kela.fi/in/internet/english.nsf/NET/081101150015EH?OpenDocument|publisher=KELA|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the unemployment funds handle the payments, most of the funding is from taxes and compulsory tax-like unemployment insurance charges.

Regardless of whether benefits are paid by Kela or from an unemployment fund, the unemployed person receives assistance from the ''Työ- ja elinkeinokeskus'' (''TE-keskus'', or the "Work and Livelihood Centre"), a government agency which helps people to find jobs and employers to find workers. In order to be considered unemployed, the seeker must register at the TE-keskus as unemployed. If the jobseeker does not have degree, the agency can require the jobseeker to apply to a school.

If the individual does not qualify for any unemployment benefit he may still be eligible for the housing benefit (''asumistuki'') from Kela and municipal social welfare provisions (''toimeentulotuki''). They are not unemployment benefits and depend on household income, but they have in practice become the basic income of many long-term unemployed.

==France==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in France}}
[[France]] uses a quasi [[Ghent system]], under which unemployment benefits are distributed by an independent agency (UNEDIC) in which [[trade union|unions]] and Employer organisations are equally represented. UNEDIC is responsible for 3 benefits: ARE, ACA and ASR The main ARE scheme requires a minimum of 122 days membership in the preceding 24 months and certain other requirements before any claims can be made. Employers pay a contribution on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with the employee contribution, fund the scheme.

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of March 2009) 57.4% of [[EUR]] 162 per day (Social security contributions ceiling in 2011), or 6900 euros per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} http://www.pole-emploi.fr/candidat/le-montant-de-votre-allocation-@/suarticle.jspz?id=4125&lt;/ref&gt; Claimants receive 57,4% of their average daily salary of the last 12 months preceding unemployment with the average amount being 1,111 euros per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} http://entreprise.lefigaro.fr/chomeurs-unedic.html&lt;/ref&gt; In France tax and other payroll taxes are paid on unemployment benefits. In 2011 claimants received the allowance for an average 291 days.

==Germany==
[[Germany]] has two different types of unemployment benefits.

=== Unemployment benefit I ===

The ''unemployment benefit I'' in [[Germany]] is also known as the unemployment insurance. The insurance is administered by the federal employment agency and funded by employee and employer contributions. This in stark contrast to FUTA in the US and other systems; where only employers make contributions. Participation (and thus contributions) are generally mandatory for both employee and employer.

All workers with a regular employment contract (''abhängig Beschäftigte''), except freelancers and certain civil servants (''Beamte''), contribute to the system. Since 2006, certain previously excluded workers have been able to opt into the system on a voluntary basis.

The system is financed by contributions from employees and employers. Employees pay 1.5% of their gross salary below the social security threshold and employers pay 1.5% contribution on top of the salary paid to the employee. The contribution level was reduced from 3.25% for employees and employers as part of labour market reforms known as Hartz. Contributions are paid only on earnings up to the social security ceiling (2012: 5,600 EUR).

The system is largely self-financed but also receives a subsidy from the state to run the Jobcenters.

Unemployed workers are entitled to:
* Living allowance known as unemployment benefit
* Help in finding work
* Training

Unemployed benefit is paid to workers who have contributed at least during 12 months preceding their loss of a job. The allowance is paid for half of the period that the worker has contributed. Claimants get 60% of their previous net salary (capped at the social security ceiling), or 67% for claimants with children. The maximum benefit is therefore 2964 Euros (in 2012).
In 2011 the federal Work Agency had revenues and expenses of 37.5 bn EUR&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531155700/http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/zentraler-Content/Veroeffentlichungen/Intern/Geschaeftsbericht-2011.pdf |archivedate=31 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a change in German law effective since 2008, provided their job history qualifies them, benefit recipients aged 50 to 54 now receive an unemployment benefit for 15 months, those 55 to 57 for 18 months and those 58 or older receive benefits for 24 months. For those under the age of 50 who have not been employed for more than 30 months in a job which paid into the social security scheme, full unemployment benefit can be received for a maximum period of 12 months. Note how the duration of eligibility is variegated in Germany to account for the difficulty older people have re-entering the job market.

=== Unemployment benefit II ===
{{Main article|Hartz concept}}
If a worker is not eligible for the full unemployment benefits or after receiving the full unemployment benefit for the maximum of 12 months, he is able to apply for benefits from the so-called Arbeitslosengeld II (Hartz IV) programme, an open-ended welfare programme which ensures people do not fall into penury. A person receiving Hartz IV benefits is paid 404 EUR &lt;small&gt;(2016)&lt;/small&gt; a month for living expenses plus the cost of adequate housing (including heating) and health care. Couples can receive benefits for each partner including their children. Additionally, children can get "benefits for education and participation". Germany does not have an EBT (electronic benefits transfer) card system in place and, instead, disburses welfare in cash or via direct deposit onto the recipient's bank account. People who receive Hartz 4 are obligated to seek for jobs and can be forced to take part in social programs or [[Mini jobs]] in order to receive this Hartz 4 money. Most of these programs and Mini jobs oblige the employee to work the same hours as a normal full-time job each day, 5 days a week. 

==Greece==
Unemployment benefits in Greece are administered through OAED ({{Lang-el|Οργανισμός Απασχόλησης Εργατικού Δυναμικού}}, Manpower Employment Organization) and are available only to laid-off salaried workers with full employment and social security payments during the previous two years. The self-employed do not qualify, and neither do those with other sources of income. The monthly benefit is fixed at the "55% of 25 minimum daily wages", and is currently 360 [[euro]]s per month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-radio-and-tv-19289566 |title=Greeks go back to basics as recession bites |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OAEDbenefits&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oaed.gr/en/2012-02-07-18-31-19/2012-02-07-18-31-52/2012-07-03-09-22-05 |publisher=ΟΑΕΔ |title=OAED Unemployment Benefits (in Greek)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 10% increase for each under-age child. Recipients are eligible for at most twelve months; the exact duration depends on the collected number of ensema ''ένσημα'', that is social security payment coupons-stamps collected (i.e. days of work) during the 14 months before being laid off; the minimum number of such coupons, under which there is no eligibility, is 125, collected in the first 12 of the 14 aforementioned months. Eligibility since 1 January 2013, has been further constrained in that one applying for unemployment benefits for a second or more time, must not have received more than the equivalent of 450 days of such benefits during the last four years since the last time one had started receiving such benefits; if one has received unemployment benefits in this period for more than 450 days then there is no eligibility while if one has received less, then one is only eligible for at most the remaining days up until the maximum of 450 days is reached.&lt;ref name=OAEDbenefits /&gt;

In terms of an unemployment allowance, Greece allows for those found in unemployment, who are employed through an independent profession, to receive benefits if their latest paycheck had not exceed a certain amount, the current rate should not exceed € 1,467.35. When receiving benefits an individual cannot be earning money from a self-employed profession. If the income increases the fixed amount, a tax authority must issue a certificate that explains that the individual has "interrupted the exercise of the profession", which must be done within 15 days.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oaed.gr/sychnes-eroteseis-epidomata-paroches|title=Συχνές Ερωτήσεις Επιδόματα Παροχές|website=Οργαισμοσ Απαχολησησ Εργατικου Δυναμικου|language=el-GR|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment benefits are also granted to those who have generated an income that does not exceed €1,467.35 from the final paycheck received from a liberal profession. In order to receive a grant the individual must not be receiving an income from the previous liberal profession. Under the [[European Commission]], liberal professions are professions that require specialized training and that are regulated by "national governments or professional bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/promoting-entrepreneurship/we-work-for/liberal-professions_en|title=Liberal professions - Growth - European Commission|website=Growth|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal aid is also provided to workers whose jobs cannot be performed through the entire year are also provided benefits by the OAED. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1112&amp;langId=en&amp;intPageId=4571|title=Greece - Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the OAED, individuals who are benefiting from long-term unemployment must be within the ages of 20 to 66 years of age and have a family income that does not exceed € 10,000 annually.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; An individual becomes eligible for long-term benefits if the regular unemployment subsidy is exhausted after 12 months. After the expiration of the 12-month period an application towards long-term unemployment benefits must be submitted in the first 2 months. If an unemployed person seeks long term unemployment and has a child, the allowance is allowed to increase by € 586.08 (per child). Long-term unemployment can only be granted if the individual can be found registered under the OAED unemployment registrar.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

== Iceland ==
To receive [[unemployment]] benefits in [[Iceland]], one must submit an application to the Directorate of Labour (''Vinnumálastofnun'') and meet a specific criteria set forth by the department.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcc.is/english/work/unemployment-benefits/|title=Unemployment Benefits {{!}} Fjölmenningarsetur|website=www.mcc.is|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icelandic [[Employment rate|employment rates]] have traditionally been higher than every other [[OECD]] country. In the most recent financial quarter, 85.8 percent of the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] working-age population were employed, with only 2.8 percent of the population unemployed.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/emp/employment-rate.htm|title=Employment - Employment rate - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When broken down by age group, [[Iceland|Iceland's]] labor force is highly active, with 74.9 percent of the population between the ages of 15 to 24 years old and 89.4 percent of people between the ages of 25 to 55 years old active in the labor market.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; This low rate of [[unemployment]] is attributed to the adoption of the [[Ghent system]], which has been adopted by the countries of [[Denmark]], [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]], and highly emphasizes [[Trade union|trade and labor unions]] to provide unemployment benefits and protections to workers, which ultimately has led to higher union membership than other [[Capitalist economics|capitalist economies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scruggs|first=Lyle|date=1 June 2002|title=The Ghent System and Union Membership in Europe, 1970-1996|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/106591290205500201|journal=Political Research Quarterly, University of Connecticut|volume=|pages=275-297|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The safety net that these unions provide also leads to more stable job retention and less reliance on [[Part-time contract|part-time]] employment.

Unlike purely [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] states in [[Europe]], the [[Nordic model]] that [[Iceland]] adopted borrows aspects of both a [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] and [[Economic liberalism|liberal]]-[[welfare state]].&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Capitalisms Compared|last=Bowman|first=John R.|publisher=CQPress|year=1952|isbn=|location=|pages=12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iceland]] not only sees high government involvement in providing [[Welfare|social welfare]] and amenities as with the [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] model, but like the [[Liberalism|liberal]]-[[Welfare state|welfare]] model, it is also heavily reliant on [[free trade]] and markets.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The country relies on an open [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] market for economic growth, yet also embraces a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] system that allows for wage bargaining to occur between the labor force and employers in order to protect workers and ensure provisions like [[unemployment]] benefits are ensured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://economics.mit.edu/files/5726|title=The Nordic Model|last=Andersen, Holmström, Honkapohja, Korkman, Söderström, Vartiainen|first=|date=2007|website=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the [[legislation]] that ensures these benefits is The Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which was adopted in 1938 and has been amended five times since its inception to adjust to the rise of [[globalization]]. In Section 1, Articles 1-13 grant [[Trade union|trade unions]] the right to organize and negotiate with employers over fair wages for its members as well as representation for their members in the event of workplace conflicts.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asi.is/media/249303/l-80_1938.pdf|title=Act of Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights for organized [[Trade union|unions]] set forth by the [[Ministry of Welfare (Iceland)|Ministry of Welfare]] not only provide the country's labor force fair and equal representation within their respective industries, but also allow for these organizations to maintain an active relationship with the [[Politics of Iceland|Icelandic government]] to discuss economic issues, promote labor and social equality, and ensure benefits for unemployed laborers, as these [[Trade union|unions]] are highly centralized and not [[Political affiliation|politically affiliated]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment benefits in [[Iceland]] (''atvinnuleysisbætur'') can involve up to 100 percent reimbursement per month for wage earners for a maximum of 30 months.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.a-kasser.dk/unemployment-insurance-in-europe/iceland/|title=Unemployment benefits in Iceland|website=www.a-kasser.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these rates of reimbursement are determined by previous status of employment, such as whether an individual is a [[Wage earner|wage-earner]] or is [[Self-employment|self-employed]], as well as meeting certain mandates such as being a current resident of [[Iceland]], be actively searching for employment, and retaining a 25 percent position for three months within the past 12 months before filing for [[unemployment]]. &lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Unemployed workers can be compensated through either basic or income-linked benefits.

== Ireland ==
People aged 18 and over and who are unemployed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] can apply for either the Jobseeker's Allowance (''Liúntas do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta'') or the Jobseeker's Benefit (''Sochar do Lucht Cuardaigh Fostaíochta''). Both are paid by the [[Department of Social Protection]] and are nicknamed "the dole".

Unemployment benefit in Ireland can be claimed indefinitely for as long as the individual remains unemployed. The standard payment is €193 per week for those aged 26 and over. For those aged 18 to 24 the rate is €100 per week. For those aged 25 the weekly rate is €144. Payments can be increased if the unemployed has dependents. For each adult dependent, another €124.80 is added, €100 if the recipient (as opposed to the dependent) is aged 18 to 24, and for each child dependent €29.80 is added.

There are more benefits available to unemployed people, usually on a special or specific basis. Benefits include the ''Rent Supplement'', the ''Mortgage Interest Supplement'' and the ''Fuel Allowance'', among others. People on a low income (which includes those on JA/JB) are entitled to a Medical Card (although this must be applied for separately from the [[Health Service Executive]]) which provides free health care, optical care, limited dental care, aural care and subsidised prescription drugs carrying a €2.50 per item charge to a maximum monthly contribution of €25 per household (as opposed to subsidised services like non medical-card holders).

To qualify for Jobseekers Allowance, claimants must satisfy the "Habitual Residence Condition": they must have been legally in the state (or the [[Common Travel Area]]) for two years or have another good reason (such as lived abroad and are returning to Ireland after become unemployed or deported). This condition does not apply to Jobseekers Benefit (which is based on Social Insurance payments).

==Israel==
{{See also|Welfare in Israel}}
In [[Israel]], unemployment benefits are paid by [[Bituah Leumi]] (the National Insurance Institute), to which workers must pay contributions. Eligible workers must immediately register with the Employment Service Bureau upon losing their jobs or jeopordize their eligibility, and the unemployment period is considered to start upon registration with the Employment Service Bureau. To be eligible for unemployment benefits, an employee must have completed a "qualifying period" of work for which unemployment insurance contributions were paid, which varies between 300 and 360 days. Employees who were involuntarily terminated from their jobs or who terminated their own employment and can provide evidence of having done so for a justified reason are eligible for immediately receiving unemployment benefits, while those who are deemed to have terminated their employment of their own volition with no justified reason will only begin receiving unemployment benefits 90 days from the start of their unemployment period.&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/periodofentitlement/Pages/numberofdays.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il1"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/Pages/Conditionsofeligibility.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il2"&gt;https://www.btl.gov.il/English%20Homepage/Benefits/Unemployment%20Insurance/Amount/Pages/Benefitrates.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unemployment benefits are paid daily, with the amount calculated based on the employee's previous income over the past six months, but not exceeding the daily average wage for the first 125 days of payment and two-thirds of the daily average wage from the 126th day onwards. During the unemployment period, the Employment Service Bureau assists in helping locate suitable work and job training, and regularly reporting to the Employment Service Bureau is a condition for continuing to receive unemployment benefits. A person who was offered suitable work or training by the Employment Service Bureau but refused will only receive unemployment benefits 90 days after the date of the refusal, and 30 days' worth of unemployment benefits will be deducted for each subsequent refusal.&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il"/&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="btl.gov.il2"/&gt;

Members of [[kibbutz]]im and [[moshav]]im are typically not covered by the national unemployment system and are covered by the community's own social welfare system, unless they are employed outside of their community or directly by the community.

==Italy==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Italy}}
Unemployment benefits in [[Italy]] consists mainly in cash transfers based on [[contributions]] (''Assicurazione Sociale per l'Impiego, ASPI''), up to the 75 percent of the previous wages for up to sixteen months. Other measures are:
* Redundancy Fund (''Cassa integrazione guadagni'', or CIG): cash benefits provided as [[shock absorbers]] to those workers who are suspended or who work only for reduced time due to temporary difficulties of their factories, aiming to help the factories in financial difficulties, by relieving them from the costs of unused workforce
* Solidarity Contracts (''Contratti di solidarietà''): in the same cases granting CIG benefits, companies can sign contracts with reduced work time, to avoid dismissing redundancy workers. The state will grant to those workers the 60 percent of the lost part of the wage.
* Mobility allowances (''Indennità di mobilità''),: if the Redundancy Fund does not allow the company to re-establish a good financial situation, the workers can be entitled to mobility allowances. Other companies are provided [[incentive]]s for employing them. This measure has been abolished in 2012 and will stop working in 2017.
In the Italian unemployment insurance system all the measures are [[income]]-related, and they have an average [[decommodification]] level. The basis for entitlement is always [[employment]], with more specific conditions for each case, and the provider is quite always the state. An interesting feature worthy to be discussed is that the Italian system takes in consideration also the economic situation of the employers, and aims as well at relieving them from the costs of crisis.

==Japan==
{{Main article|Unemployment insurance (Japan)}}
Unemployment benefits in Japan are called "unemployment insurance" and are closer to the US or Canadian "user pays" system than the taxpayer funded systems in place in countries such as Britain, New Zealand, or Australia. It is paid for by contributions by both the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;Tokyo Employment Service Centre for Foreigners website [http://www.tfemploy.go.jp/en/spec/spec_1d.html For foreign nationals working in Japan] Retrieved on 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving a job, employees are supposed to be given a "Rishoku-hyo" document showing their ID number (the same number is supposed to be used by later employers), employment periods, and pay (which contributions are linked to). The reason for leaving is also documented separately. These items affect eligibility, timing, and amount of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/Japan/Japan-Guide/Jobs/Employment-insurance|title=Employment insurance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time that unemployed workers can receive benefits depends on the age of the employee, and how long they have been employed and paying in.&lt;ref&gt;Nagoya International Center [http://www.nic-nagoya.or.jp/en/e/2010/09/09/unemployment-insurance-3/ Insurance] Retrieved on 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

It is supposed to be compulsory for most full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jil.go.jp/english/laborinfo/library/documents/llj_law11.pdf|title=Employment Insurance Law (Japan)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they have been enrolled for at least 6 months and are fired or made redundant, leave the company at the end of their contract, or their contract is non-renewed, the now-unemployed worker will receive unemployment insurance. If a worker quit of their own accord they may have to wait between 1 and 3 months before receiving any payment.

==Mexico==
[[Mexico]] lacks a national unemployment insurance system, but it does have five programs to assist the unemployed: 

* Mexico City Unemployment Benefit Scheme - The only unemployment insurance system based on worker contributions exists in [[Mexico City]]. Unemployed residents of Mexico City who are at least 18 years of age, have worked for at least six months, have no income, and are actively seeking work are eligible for unemployment benefits for up to six months, which are composed of payments of 30 days' worth of minimum wage per month.&lt;ref name=careeraddict&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.careeraddict.com/claim-unemployment-benefits-in-mexico|title=How to Claim Unemployment Benefits in Mexico|first=Amy|last=Theodore|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) - This institution insures workers in the formal sector, providing pensions and health insurance. Workers insured by the IMSS who are unemployed may withdraw a maximum of 30 days' worth of pension savings every five years.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt; However, this does not cover the majority of workers, as 58% of the labor force is in the informal sector.

* National Employment Service - This agency, which has 165 offices nationwide, offers financial support in learning new skills to those aged 16 and above who are unemployed or underemployed, and assistance in finding new jobs in the form of information on vacancies and job fairs.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

* Temporary Employment Program - This scheme is designed to aid unemployed people who live in rural areas with high unemployment rates, any area undergoing a financial crisis, or an area that has been hit by a natural disaster or some other kind of emergency. The program funds projects to boost employment by hiring local workers aged 16 and above in jobs such as building infrastructure and promoting development, and conserving the environment and cultural heritage sites. They are paid a salary at 99% of the local minimum wage for a maximum of 132 days a year.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

* Income Generating Options Program - People living in poverty in an area of up to a maximum of 15,000 inhabitants are eligible for funding for projects to generate income for themselves.&lt;ref name=careeraddict/&gt;

==Netherlands==
Unemployment benefits in the Netherlands were introduced in 1949. Separate schemes exist for mainland Netherlands and for the [[Caribbean Netherlands]].

The scheme in mainland Netherlands entails that, according to the Werkloosheidswet (Unemployment Law, WW), employers are responsible for paying the contributions to the scheme, which are deducted from the salary received by the employees. In 2012 the contribution was 4.55% of gross salary up to a ceiling of 4,172 euros per month. The first 1,435.75 euros of an employees gross salaries are not subject to the 4.55% contribution.

Benefits are paid for a maximum period of 38 months and claimants get 75% of last salary for 2 months and 70% thereafter with a maximum benefit of 3128 euros, depending on how long the claimant has been employed previously. Workers older than 50 years who are unemployed for over 2 months are entitled to a special benefit called the IOAW, if they do not receive the regular unemployment benefit (WW).

==New Zealand==
{{Main article|Social welfare in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]], Jobseeker Support, previously known as the Unemployment Benefit and also known as "the dole" provides income support for people who are looking for work or training for work. It is one of a number of benefits administered by [[Work and Income]], a service of the Ministry of Social Development.

To get this benefit, a person must meet the conditions and obligations specified in section 88A to 123D Social Security Act 1964. These conditions and obligations cover things such as age, residency status, and availability to work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/income_support/main_benefits/unemployment_benefit/unemployment_benefit.htm Unemployment Benefit] Manuals and Procedures - Work and Income website&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount that is paid depends on things such as the person's age, income, marital status and whether they have children. It is adjusted annually on 1 April and in response to changes in legislature. Some examples of the maximum after tax weekly rate at 1 April 2011 are:
* $175.10 for a single person aged 20–24 years without children
* $210.13 for a single person 25 years or over
* $325.98 for a sole parent
* $350.20 for a married, de facto or civil union couple with or without children ($167.83 each).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/individuals/forms-and-brochures/benefit-rates-april-2011.html|title=Work and Income Unemployment Benefit Rates|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Spain}}
The Spanish unemployment benefits system is part of the [[Social Security in Spain|Social security system of Spain]]. Benefits are managed by the State Public Employment Agency (SEPE).The basis for entitlement is having contributed for a minimum period during the time preceding unemployment, with further conditions that may be applicable. The system comprises contributory benefits and non-contributory benefits.

Contributory benefits are payable to those unemployed persons with a minimum of 12 months contributions over a period of 6 years preceding unemployment. The benefit is payable for 1/3 of the contribution period. The benefit amount is 70% of the legal reference salary plus additional amounts for persons with dependants. The benefit reduces to 60% of the reference salary after 6 months. The minimum benefit is 497 euros per month and the maximum is 1087,20 euros per month for a single person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayudasparados.com/importe-maximo-desempleo-2012/105|title=importe maximo desempleo 2018 - Ayudas a Parados|website=www.ayudasparados.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-contributory allowance is available to those persons who are no longer entitled to the contributory pension and who do not have income above 75% of the national minimum wage.

==Sweden==
{{Main article|Unemployment benefits in Sweden}}
[[Sweden]] uses the [[Ghent system]], under which a significant proportion of unemployment benefits are distributed by [[trade union|union]] unemployment funds. Unemployment benefits are divided into a voluntary scheme with income related compensation up to a certain level and a comprehensive scheme that provides a lower level of basic support. The voluntary scheme requires a minimum of 12 months membership and 6 months employment during that time before any claims can be made. Employers pay a fee on top of the pre-tax income of their employees, which together with membership fees, fund the scheme (see [[Unemployment funds in Sweden]]).

The maximum unemployment benefit is (as of July 2016) [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 980 per day. During the first 200 days the unemployed will receive 80 percent of his or her normal income during the last 12 months. From day 201-300 this goes down to 70 percent and from day 301-450 the insurance covers 65 percent of the normal income (only available for parents to children under the age of 18). In Sweden tax is paid on unemployment benefits, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the [[municipality]] tax rate). In other currencies, as of June 2017, this means a maximum of approximately £900, $1,150, or [[€]]1,000, each month after tax. Private insurance is also available, mainly through professional organisations, to provide income related compensation that otherwise exceeds the ceiling of the scheme. The comprehensive scheme is funded by tax.

==Saudi Arabia==
[[Saudi Arabia]] is an economic [[welfare state]] with free medical care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.gov.sa/Detail.asp?InSectionID=1516&amp;InNewsItemID=1746|title=Request Rejected|website=www.mofa.gov.sa}}&lt;/ref&gt; and unemployment benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saudinf.com/main/h814.htm|title=Social Services (2) - SAMIRAD (Saudi Arabia Market Information Resource)|website=saudinf.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the country relies not on taxation but mainly [[oil]] revenues to maintain the social and economic services to its populace.

Payment:
2000 SAR (USD $534) for only 12 months for unemployed person from ages 18–35

==Turkey==
By law, legally employed workers, regardless of their citizenship are eligible for unemployment benefits given that they are at least 18 years old, the employees contribute 1% to unemployment funds while the employers contribute 2%, and the workers are eligible to receive benefits after 600 days of contributions within the preceding 3 years of employment. the benefit payment is 50% for the average daily earnings based on the last 4 months and cannot be higher than the mimimum wage (per industry). Benefits may be paid for a max of 1,080 days depending on the number of contributions. some are skeptical of how well the system is functioning in turkey&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justlanded.com/english/Turkey/Turkey-Guide/Jobs/Social-security-in-Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jobseeker's Allowance rates===
JSA for a single person is changed annually, and at 3 August 2012 the maximum payable was [[£]]71.00 per week for a person aged over 25 and £56.25 per week for a person aged 18–24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jobseeker's Allowance|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_200090.html|publisher=Directgov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules for couples where both are unemployed are more complex, but a maximum of £112.55 per week is payable, dependent on age and other factors. Income-based JSA is reduced for people with savings of over £6,000, by a reduction of £1 per week per £250 of savings, up to £16,000. People with savings of over £16,000 are not able to get IB-JSA at all.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Benefit &amp; Tax Credit Rates 2006 — © [[Citizens Advice Bureau]] (United Kingdom) and the [[Child Poverty Action Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; The British system provides rent payments as part of a separate scheme called [[Housing Benefit]].

Unemployment benefit is commonly referred to as "the dole"; to receive the benefit is to be "on the dole". "Dole" here is an archaic expression meaning "one's allotted portion", from the synonymous [[Old English]] word ''dāl''.

==United States==
[[File:Unemployment rate map of the united states.gif|300px|thumb|right|Unemployment rate by county from January 1990 - March 2017]]
In the United States, there are 50 state unemployment insurance programs plus one each in the [[District of Columbia]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]]. Though policies vary by state, unemployment benefits generally pay eligible workers as high as $783.00 per week in the [[Massachusetts]] to a low as $235 per week maximum in [[Mississippi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aboutunemployment.org/faqs/best-and-worst-states-for-unemployment-benefits/|title=Best and Worst States for Unemployment Benefits - 2017 {{!}} AboutUnemployment.org|website=aboutunemployment.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes levied against employers, to workers who have become unemployed through no fault of their own. Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct ("terminated for cause") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-wrongful-termination-2061658|title=How to Handle a Wrongful Termination|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In every state, employees who quit their job without "good cause" are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the definition of good cause varies by state. In some states, being fired for misconduct permanently bars the employee from receiving unemployment benefits, while in others it only disqualifies the employee for a short period. This compensation is classified as a type of social welfare benefit. According to the [[Internal Revenue Code]], these types of benefits are to be included in a taxpayer's gross income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tax Topics - Topic 418 Unemployment Compensation |work=Internal Revenue Service |url=https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc418.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard time-length of unemployment compensation is six months, although extensions are possible during economic downturns. During the [[Great Recession]], unemployment benefits were extended to 73 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-long-unemployment-benefits-now-last-in-each-state-2014-1|title=Here's How Long Unemployment Benefits Now Last In Each State|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court held that federal unemployment law is constitutional and does not violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] in ''[[Steward Machine Company v. Davis]]'', [[Case citation|301 U.S. 548]] (1937).

===Federal-state joint programs===

Unemployment insurance is a federal-state program financed through federal and state payroll taxes (federal and state UI taxes).&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uitaxtopic.asp|title=Unemployment Insurance Tax Topic, Employment &amp; Training Administration (ETA) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=workforcesecurity.doleta.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most states employers pay state and federal unemployment taxes if:

:(1) they pay wages to employees totaling $1,500 or more in any quarter of a calendar year; or,&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;
:(2) they had at least one employee during any day of a week during 20 weeks in a calendar year, regardless of whether the weeks were consecutive. Some state laws differ from the federal law.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;

To facilitate this program, the [[U.S. Congress]] passed the [[Federal Unemployment Tax Act]] (FUTA), which authorizes the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to collect an annual federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies. FUTA covers the costs of administering the Unemployment Insurance and Job Service programs in all states. In addition, FUTA pays one-half of the cost of extended unemployment benefits which are triggered in periods of high state unemployment. FUTA also provides a fund from which states UI funds may borrow to pay benefits. As originally established, the states paid the federal government.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt;

The FUTA tax rate was originally three percent of taxable wages collected from employers who employed at least four employees,&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 182"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Joseph  F. |title= ''State and Local Government''|year= 1970 |publisher= [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |isbn= | pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; and employers could deduct up to 90 percent of the amount due if they paid taxes to a state to support a system of unemployment insurance which met Federal standards,&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 213"/&gt; but the rules have recently changed. The FUTA tax rate is now, as of 30 June 2011, 6.0 percent of taxable wages of employees who meet both the above and following criteria,&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; and the taxable wage base is the first $7,000 paid in wages to each employee during a calendar year.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; Employers who pay the state unemployment tax on time receive an offset credit of up to 5.4 percent regardless of the rate of tax they pay their state. Therefore, the net FUTA tax rate is generally 0.6 percent (6.0 percent - 5.4 percent), for a maximum FUTA tax of $42.00 per employee, per year (.006 X $7,000 = $42.00). State law determines individual state unemployment insurance tax rates.&lt;ref name="LABOR UNEMPLOY"/&gt; In the United States, unemployment insurance tax rates use [[experience rating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/fth/lavape/9615.html|title=Unemployment Insurance Experience Rating of Firms and Layoffs|first1=P.

Although the taxable wage base for each state/territory is at least $7,000 as mandated by FUTA, only four states or territories still remain at this minimum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanpayroll.org/members/stateui/state-ui-2/|title=State Unemployment Wage Bases|website=www.americanpayroll.org|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These states/territories include Arizona, California, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Florida and Puerto Rico maintain tax rates similar to those of other states, but Arizona and California both have a higher maximum tax rate. Florida's minimum tax rate is 0.1% and the state maximum is 5.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://floridarevenue.com/dor/taxes/reemployment.html#who|title=FL Dept Rev - Reemployment Tax|website=floridarevenue.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Puerto Rico, employers are taxed between 2.4% and 5.4% depending on their experience rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.payroll-taxes.com/state-tax/puerto-rico|title=Puerto Rico State Tax Information {{!}} Payroll Taxes|last=igor@platon.sk|first=Igor Mino,|website=www.payroll-taxes.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, Arizona's minimum was 0.03%, but its maximum was 7.79%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://des.az.gov/sites/default/files/ui_tax_rate_chart.pdf|title=Unemployment Insurance Tax Rates|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Arizona Department of Economic Security|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; California's tax rate on the taxable wage base is currently higher than the federal minimum of 6.0%.

Within the above constraints, the individual [[U.S. state|states]] and territories raise their own contributions and run their own programs. The federal government sets broad guidelines for coverage and eligibility, but states vary in how they determine benefits and eligibility.

Federal rules are drawn by the [[United States Department of Labor]], Employment and Training Administration. For most states, the maximum period for receiving benefits is 26 weeks. There is an extended benefit program (authorized through the Social Security Acts) that may be triggered by the state unemployment rate. Congress has often passed temporary programs to extend benefits during recessions. This was done with the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) program in 2002-2003, which has since expired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation |work=Employment &amp; Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/factsheetteuc.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in force through 2 June 2010, with the Extended Unemployment Compensation 2008 legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emergency Unemployment Compensation 2008 (EUC) Program |work=Employment &amp; Training Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor |url= http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/euc08.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, legislation that provides an extension of federal extended unemployment benefits through November 2010 was signed by the president. The legislation extended benefits for 2.3 million unemployed workers who had exhausted their unemployment benefits.

The federal government lends money to the states for unemployment insurance when states run short of funds which happens when the state's UI fund cannot cover the cost of current benefits. A high unemployment rate shrinks UI tax revenues and increases expenditures on benefits. State UI finances and the need for loans are exacerbated when a state cuts taxes and increases benefits. FUTA loans to state funds are repaid with interest.

Congressional actions to increase penalties for states incurring large debts for unemployment benefits led to state fiscal crises in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

One interesting feature of the UI tax is that it targets firms that have recently had layoffs, potentially hitting distressed firms. Recent work shows that UI tax increases significantly reduce hiring and employment in affected firms, potentially eroding the macroeconomics stabilizing influence of the UI program. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unemployment Insurance Taxes and Labor Demand: Quasi-Experimental Evidence from Administrative Data |work=SSRN Repository |publisher=Working Paper |url= https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3062412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroeconomic function ===
To Keynesians, unemployment insurance acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1999/199964/199964pap.pdf |last1= Cohen| first1= Darrel| first2= Glenn| last2= Follette| title= The Automatic Fiscal Stabilizers: Quietly Doing Their Thing| location= Washington, DC| publisher= Divisions of Research &amp; Statistics and Monetary Affairs, [[Federal Reserve Board]]| year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benefits automatically increase when unemployment is high and fall when unemployment is low, smoothing the business cycle; however, others claim that the taxation necessary to support this system serves to decrease employment.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Eligibility and amount ===
In order to receive benefits, a person must have worked for at least one quarter in the previous year and have been laid-off by an employer. Workers who were temporary or were paid under the table are not eligible for unemployment insurance. If a worker quits without good cause or is fired for misconduct, then they are normally not eligible for UI benefits. There are five common reasons a claim for unemployment benefits are denied: the worker is unavailable for work, the worker quit his or her job without good cause, the worker was fired for misconduct, refusing suitable work, and unemployment resulting from a labor dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unemployed Without Benefits: A Couple's Struggle |first=Kathy |last=Lohr |work=National Public Radio |date=14 January 2009 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99170822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://utahstaffingcompanies.com/helpful-tips-for-employers/unemployment-benefits-eligibility/&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it is only practical to verify whether the worker quit or was fired. If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.&lt;ref name="ctdol.state.ct.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ctdol.state.ct.us/progsupt/unemplt/new-faqui.htm|title=Unemployment Insurance Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)|first=State of Connecticut Department of|last=Labor|website=www.ctdol.state.ct.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be good cause.

Generally, the worker must be unemployed through no fault of his/her own although workers often file for benefits they are not entitled to; when the employer demonstrates that the unemployed person quit or was fired for cause the worker is required to pay back the benefits they received. The unemployed person must also meet state requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time (referred to as a “base period”) to be eligible for benefits. In most states, the base period is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters prior to the time that the claim is filed.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"&gt;[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/uifactsheet.asp State Unemployment Benefits] ''US Department of Labor''&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployment benefits are based on reported covered quarterly earnings. The amount of earnings and the number of quarters worked are used to determine the length and value of the unemployment benefit. The average weekly in 2010 payment was $293.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/08/AR2010030804927.html|title=Are unemployment benefits no longer temporary?|last=Fletcher|first=Michael A.|date=9 March 2010|work=The Washington Post|last2=Hedgpeth|first2=Dana|access-date=2016-09-04|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]] passed in February 2009, many unemployed people receive up to [[99ers|99 weeks]] of unemployment benefits; this may depend on State legislation. Before the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the maximum number of weeks allowed was 26.

=== Application process ===
It generally takes two weeks for benefit payments to begin, the first being a "waiting week", which is not reimbursed, and the second being the time lag between eligibility for the program and the first benefit actually being paid.

To begin a claim, the unemployed worker must apply for benefits through a state unemployment agency.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"/&gt; In certain instances, the employer initiates the process. Generally, the certification includes the affected person affirming that they are "able and available for work", the amount of any part-time earnings they may have had, and whether they are actively seeking work. These certifications are usually accomplished either over the Internet or via an interactive voice response telephone call, but in a few states may be by mail. After receiving an application, the state will notify the individual if they qualify and the rate they will receive every week. The state will also review the reason for separation from employment. Many states require the individual to periodically certify that the conditions of the benefits are still met.

=== Disqualification/Appeals ===

If a worker's reason for separation from their last job is due to some reason other than a "lack of work," a determination will be made about whether they are eligible for benefits. Generally, all determinations of eligibility for benefits are made by the appropriate State under its law or applicable federal laws. If a worker is disqualified or denied benefits, they have the right to file an appeal within an established time-frame. The State will advise a worker of his or her appeal rights. An employer may also appeal a determination if they do not agree with the State's determination regarding the employee's eligibility.&lt;ref name="State Unemployment Benefits"/&gt; If the worker's claim is denied, then they have the right to appeal. If the worker was fired for misconduct, then the employer has the burden to prove substantially that the termination of employment is a misconduct defined by individual states laws.&lt;ref name="ctdol.state.ct.us"/&gt; However, if the employee quit their job, then they must prove that their voluntary separation must be good cause. Success rate of unemployment appeals is two-thirds, or 67% of the time for the most claimants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workforce.com/articles/penny-wise-pound-foolish-on-unemployment-challenges

===Measurement===

==== Current data ====
Each Thursday, the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] issues the ''Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/current.htm|title=ETA Press Release: Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims Report|website=www.dol.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headline number is the seasonally adjusted estimate for the initial claims for unemployment for the previous week in the United States. This statistic, because it is published weekly, is depended on as a current indicator of the labor market and the economy generally.

In 2016, the number of people on unemployment benefits fell to around 1.74 the lowest in the last 4 decades.

==== Unemployment insurance outlook ====
Twice a year, the Office of Management and Budget delivers an economic assessment of the unemployment insurance program as it relates to budgetary issues.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"&gt;[http://workforcesecurity.doleta.gov/unemploy/content/prez_budget.asp UI Outlook: Overview] ''US Department of Labor''&lt;/ref&gt; As it relates to the FY 2012 budget, the OMB reports that the insured unemployment rate (IUR) is projected to average 3.6% in both FY 2011 and in FY 2012. State unemployment regular benefit outlays are estimated at $61 billion in FY 2011 and $64.3 billion in FY 2012, down somewhat from Midsession estimates.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; Outlays from state trust fund accounts are projected to exceed revenues and interest income by $16.0 billion in FY 2011 and $15.1 billion in FY 2012.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; State trust fund account balances, net of loans, are projected to continue to fall, from -$27.4 billion at the end of FY 2010 to -$62.7 billion at the end of FY 2013, before starting to grow again.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; 

Net balances are not projected to become positive again until well beyond FY 2016. Up to 40 states are projected to continue borrowing heavily from the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) over the next few years.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; The aggregate loan balance is projected to increase from $40.2 billion at the end of FY 2010 to a peak end-of-year balance of $68.3 billion in FY 2013. Due to the high volume of state loans and increased EB payments, FUA and EUCA are projected to borrow $26.7 billion from the general fund in FY 2011 and an additional $19.4 billion in FY 2012, with neither account projected to return to a net positive balance before 2016.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt; The general fund advances must be repaid with interest.&lt;ref name="UI Outlook: Overview"/&gt;

===Economic rationale and issues===
The economic argument for unemployment insurance comes from the principle of [[adverse selection]]. One common criticism of unemployment insurance is that it induces [[moral hazard]], the fact that unemployment insurance lowers on-the-job effort and reduces job-search effort.

====Adverse selection====
[[Adverse selection]] refers to the fact that “workers who have the highest probability of becoming unemployed have the highest demand for unemployment insurance.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"&gt;{{cite book|title=''Public Finance''|last=Rosen|first=Harvey S.|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-351128-3|location=New York, New York|pages=292|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adverse selection causes profit maximizing private insurance agencies to set high premiums for the insurance because there is a high likelihood they will have to make payments to the policyholder. High premiums work to exclude many individuals who otherwise might purchase the insurance. “A compulsory government program avoids the adverse selection problem. Hence, government provision of UI has the potential to increase efficiency. However, government provision does not eliminate moral hazard.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt;

====Moral hazard====
“At the same time, those workers who managed to obtain insurance might experience more unemployment otherwise would have been the case.”&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt; The private insurance company would have to determine whether the employee is unemployed through no fault of their own, which is difficult to determine. Incorrect determinations could result in the payout of significant amounts for fraudulent claims or alternately failure to pay legitimate claims. This leads to the rationale that if government could solve either problem that government intervention would increase efficiency.

====Unemployment insurance effect on unemployment====
In the [[Great Recession]], the “moral hazard” issue of whether unemployment insurance—and specifically extending benefits past the maximum 99 weeks—significantly encourages unemployment by discouraging workers from finding and taking jobs was expressed by Republican legislators. Conservative economist Robert Barro found that benefits raised the unemployment rate 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barro, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703959704575454431457720188 "The Folly of Subsidizing Unemployment"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 30 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt; Disagreeing with Barro's study were Berkeley economist [[Jesse Rothstein]], who found the “vast majority” of unemployment was due to “demand shocks” not “[unemployment insurance]-induced supply reductions.”&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-cohn/97971/would-extending-unemployment-benefits-increase-unemployment Would Extending Unemployment Benefits Increase Unemployment?].

A November 2011 report by the [[Congressional Budget Office]] found that even if unemployment benefits convince some unemployed to ignore job openings, these openings were quickly filled by new entrants into the labor market.&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/124xx/doc12437/11-15-Outlook_Stimulus_Testimony.pdf Policies for Increasing Economic Growth and Employment] cbo.gov 15 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of studies on unemployment insurance's effect on employment by the [[Political Economy Research Institute]] found that unemployed who collected benefits did not find themselves out of work longer than those who ''didn’t'' have unemployment benefits; and that unemployed workers did not search for work more or reduce their wage expectations once their benefits ran out.&lt;ref name=Zuylen-Wood/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/10dbb94dafa96d904bcaf546ee3b02a2/publication/456/ Unemployment Benefits and Work Incentives: The U.S. Labor Market in the Great Recession (revised), Howell, David R.; Azizoglu, Bert M.; [[Political Economy Research Institute]], 21 Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

One concern over unemployment insurance increasing unemployment is based on experience rating benefit uses which can sometimes be imperfect. That is, the cost to the employer in increased taxes is less than the benefits that would be paid to the employee upon layoff. The firm in this instance believes that it is more cost effective to lay off the employee, causing more unemployment than under perfect experience rating.&lt;ref name="UNEMPLOY 215"/&gt;

====Unemployment insurance effect on employment====
An alternative rationale for unemployment insurance is that it may allow for improving the quality of matches between workers and firms. Marimon and Zilibotti argued that although a more generous unemployment benefit system may indeed increase the unemployment rate, it may also help improve the average match quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1468-0297.00432 | volume=109 | issue=455 | title=Unemployment vs. Mismatch of Talents: Reconsidering Unemployment Benefits | year=1999 | journal=The Economic Journal | pages=266–291 | last1 = Marimon | first1 = Ramon | subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar point is made by Mazur who analyzed the welfare and inequality effects of a policy reform giving entitlement for unemployment insurance to quitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |subscription=y |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2016.07.001 |title=Can welfare abuse be welfare improving? |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=141 |pages=11 |year=2016 |last1=Mazur |first1=Karol }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arash Nekoei and Andrea Weber present empirical evidence from Austria that extending unemployment benefit duration raises wages by improving reemployment firm quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1257/aer.20150528 | subscription=y | volume=107 | issue=2 | title=Does Extending Unemployment Benefits Improve Job Quality? | year=2017 | journal=American Economic Review | pages=527–561 | last1 = Nekoei | first1 = Arash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tatsiramos studied data from European countries and found that although unemployment insurance does increase unemployment duration, the duration of subsequent employment tends to be longer (suggesting better match quality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2009.7.6.1225 | volume=7 | issue=6 | title=Unemployment Insurance in Europe: Unemployment Duration and Subsequent Employment Stability | year=2009 | journal=Journal of the European Economic Association | pages=1225–1260 | last1 = Tatsiramos | first1 = Konstantinos| subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative policy====
An alternative to unemployment insurance intended to reduce the moral hazard costs would introduce mandated individual saving accounts for workers to draw on after being laid off. The plan, by [[Martin Feldstein]] would pay any positive account balance at retirement to the employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Feldstein |first1= Martin |year=2005 |title= Rethinking Social Insurance |journal=  NBER Working Papers 11250 |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc }}   Feldstein finds that the costs, loans to individuals when funds are exhausted and the forgiveness of negative account balances at retirement, of this program to the government would be less than the current unemployment insurance program.  The benefits of the program include providing the same level of protection to the unemployed while correcting some of the [[moral hazard]] problem {{cite journal |last1= Feldstein |first1= Martin |last2= Altman |first2= Daniel |year= 1998 |title= Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts |journal= NBER Working Paper Series |volume= 6860 |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Effect on state budgets ====
Another issue with unemployment insurance relates to its effects on state budgets. During recessionary time periods, the number of unemployed rises and they begin to draw benefits from the program. The longer the recession lasts, depending on the state's starting UI program balance, the quicker the state begins to run out of funds. The recession that began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 has significantly impacted state budgets. According to The Council of State Governments, by 18 March 2011, 32 states plus the Virgin Islands had borrowed nearly $45.7 billion. The Labor Department estimates by the fourth quarter of 2013, as many as 40 states may need to borrow more than $90 billion to fund their unemployment programs and it will take a decade or more to pay off the debt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/drupal/content/state-unemployment-insurance-trust-funds-march-2011-update Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds Update] ''Council of State Governments''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Insurance funds====
Possible policy options for states to shore up the unemployment insurance funds include lowering benefits for recipients and/or raising taxes on businesses. Kentucky took the approach of raising taxes and lowering benefits to attempt to balance its unemployment insurance program. Starting in 2010, a claimant's weekly benefits will decrease from 68% to 62% and the taxable wage base will increase from $8,000 to $12,000, over a ten-year period. These moves are estimated to save the state over $450 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://migration.kentucky.gov/Newsroom/governor/20100615unempins.htm] ''Kentucky.gov''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxing or exempting benefits====
The argument for taxation of [[social welfare]] benefits is that they result in a realized gain for a taxpayer. The argument against taxation is that the benefits are generally less than the [[federal poverty level]].

Unemployment compensation has been taxable by the federal government since 1987.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite web |author=Scott, Christine |title=Taxation of Unemployment Benefits: Report for Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress |work=Cornell University ILR School |date=14 January 2005 |format=PDF |url= http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1224&amp;context=key_workplace }}&lt;/ref&gt; Code Section 85 deemed unemployment compensation included in gross income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/85- |title=Section 85 |work=Internal Revenue Service |publisher=Cornell University Law School }}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal taxes are not withheld from unemployment compensation at the time of payment unless requested by the recipient using [[Form W-4#Filing|Form W-4V]].&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Voluntary Withholding Request |work=Internal Revenue Service |date=August 2006 |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4v.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, Rep. [[Phil English|Philip English]] introduced legislation to repeal the taxation of unemployment compensation, but the legislation did not advance past [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|committee]].&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=H.R. 798 (108th): Unemployment Tax Repeal Act of 2003 |work=United States Congress |publisher=govtrack.us |date=13 February 2003 |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h108-798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most states with income tax consider unemployment compensation to be taxable.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;
Prior to 1987, unemployment compensation amounts were excluded from federal gross income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxlinks.com/rulings/1971/revrul71-425.htm "Revenue Ruling 71-425"]. ''Internal Revenue Service''. Taxlinks.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
For the US Federal [[tax year]] of 2009, as a result of the signing of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] signed by [[Barack Obama]] on 17 February 2009 the first $2,400 worth of unemployment income received during the 'tax year' of 2009 will be exempted from being considered as taxable income on the Federal level, when American taxpayers file their 2009 IRS tax return paperwork in early 2010.

===Job sharing / short-time working===
[[Job sharing]] or work sharing and [[short time]] or short-time working refer to situations or systems in which employees agree to or are forced to accept a reduction in working time and pay. These can be based on individual agreements or on government programs in many countries that try to prevent unemployment. In these, employers have the option of reducing work hours to part-time for many employees instead of laying off some of them and retaining only full-time workers. For example, employees in 18 states of the United States can then receive unemployment payments for the hours they are no longer working.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93581221 Companies Implement Part-Time Layoffs] by Curt Nickisch. Morning Edition, National Public Radio.  21 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Payment through prepaid debit cards===
In 2013, it was reported that most U.S. states deliver unemployment benefits to [[unbanked|recipients who do not have a bank account]] through a [[prepaid debit card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nclc.org/issues/unemployment-compensation-prepaid-cards.html 2013 Survey of Unemployment Compensation Prepaid Cards] ''©National Consumer Law Center''&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government uses the Direct Express Debit [[Mastercard]] [[prepaid debit card]] offered by Mastercard and [[Comerica Bank]] to give some federal assistance payments to people who do not have bank accounts. Many states have similar programs for unemployment payments and other assistance.

[[File:Cleveland Museum of Art - damaged Thinker.jpg|thumb|Vandalized cast of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''[[The Thinker]]'', [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], US]]

'''Vandalism of art''' is intentional damage of an artwork. The object, usually exhibited in public, becomes damaged as a result of the act, and remains in place right after the act.  This may distinguish it from  [[art destruction]] and [[iconoclasm]], where it may be wholly destroyed and removed, and [[art theft]], or [[Looted art|looting]].

Numerous acts of vandalism against art exhibits are known and some objects, such as ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' and ''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'', have been intentionally damaged several times. Many vandals were diagnosed with a mental disorder and some, such as [[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]], had a history of attacking artworks. A vast amount of damage consists of leaving a minor scratch, a stuck chewing gum, a pencil mark and so on, and usually escapes publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gamboni|Gamboni]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; More visible acts of vandalism were premeditated, as the tool of destruction&amp;nbsp;– a knife, paint, acid or hammer&amp;nbsp;– was intentionally brought to the scene. In most cases, the artworks were restored. Restorations were costly and time-consuming and in many cases were followed by shielding the artwork from future attacks.

== History of the term ==

The term ''vandalisme'' was coined in 1794 by [[Henri Grégoire]], bishop of [[Blois]], to describe the destruction of artwork following the [[French Revolution]]. The term originated from the invasion of Rome in 455 by the [[Germanic peoples|East Germanic tribe]] of [[Vandals]], which resulted in destruction of numerous artworks, and was quickly adopted across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merrills |first1=Andy |last2=Miles |first2=Richard |title=The Vandals |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6068-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTIHPoyMOFYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repeated vandalism ==

=== Hans-Joachim Bohlmann ===

[[Hans-Joachim Bohlmann]] (1937–2009) was a German serial vandal. Between 1977 and 2006, he damaged over 50 paintings worth more than 270&amp;nbsp;million [[Deutsche Mark]]s (about 138&amp;nbsp;million euros) by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] and other artists. Bohlmann had a [[personality disorder]] and was treated in various psychiatric hospitals since a young age. In most acts, he sprayed paintings with [[sulfuric acid]], targeting faces of the personages.&lt;ref name=sp2&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-42008774.html Ich bin mein eigener Sklave]. ''Spiegel'', 1 October 2005 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MonaLisaShield.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The setup of ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' exhibit in the [[Louvre]].]]

=== Mona Lisa ===

''[[Mona Lisa]]'' by [[Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]] has long been attracting vandals and is currently one of the best-protected artworks. In 1956, the lower part of the painting was severely damaged when a vandal doused the painting with acid while it was on display at a museum in Montauban, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5392000.stm|title=Faces of the week|work=BBC|date=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December of the same year, a young Bolivian named Ugo Ungaza Villegas threw a rock at the painting; this resulted in the loss of a speck of pigment near the left elbow, which was later painted over.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140328010816/http://www.monalisamania.com/faq.htm Mona FAQ]. Mona Lisa Mania&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[bulletproof glass]] has shielded the Mona Lisa from more recent attacks. In April 1974, a handicapped woman, upset by the museum's policy for the disabled, sprayed red paint at the painting while it was on display at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GgwUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CIsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2980,1609749|title=Mona Lisa sprayed|work=[[The Free-Lance Star]]|date=20 April 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a [[terracotta]] mug or teacup, purchased at the museum, at the painting in the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/12/content_11868974.htm|title=Mona Lisa attacked by Russian woman|work=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/russian-tourist-hurls-mug-at-mona-lisa-in-louvre/article/feed/66265|title=Russian tourist hurls mug at Mona Lisa in Louvre|agency=Associated Press|date=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the painting was undamaged.

=== Night Watch ===
[[File:Vandalized Night Watch 1975-09-16c.jpg|260px|thumb|Rembrandt's ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' after being cut by William de Rijk in September 1975]]
Rembrandt's ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642) is one of the most popular paintings at the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam. It is viewed by about 4,000 to 5,000 visitors daily with its value estimated at $925,000 in the 1970s. The painting was vandalized on several occasions. On 13 January 1911, an unemployed navy cook tried to cut it with a knife, but could not cut through the thick varnish on the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E1DB1331E233A25757C1A9679C946096D6CF Slashes famous picture.; Discharged Naval Cook Mutilate Master's "Night Watch" at Amsterdam], ''New York Times'', 14 January 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=t1&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956951,00.html Rembrandt's Night Watch], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, William de Rijk, an unemployed school teacher, cut dozens of zigzag lines in the painting with a knife before he was wrestled by the guards. The day before, de Rijk had been turned away from the museum because he arrived after closing time. After the event, he was identified with a mental disorder; he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and committed suicide there on 21 April 1976. It took six months to restore the painting, and traces of the cuts still remain.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref name=c1978/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goss, Steven (Summer 2001) [http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/3/toolsofartvandalism.php A Partial Guide to the Tools of Art Vandalism], ''Cabinet Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SM87KqxAuO8C&amp;pg=PA114|page=114|title=Un iconoclasme moderne: théorie et pratiques contemporaines du vandalisme artistique|author=Gamboni, Dario |publisher=Editions d'En bas|year=1983|isbn=2-8290-0051-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, a man threw acid on the painting. The guards managed to quickly dilute it with water so that it penetrated only the varnish layer, and the painting was restored again.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225158/http://www.artcrimes.net/night-watch The Night Watch]. ''Art Crimes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Little Mermaid ===
[[File:Little mermaid examined.jpg|260px|thumb|Police technicians examine the damage to [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]] after it was blasted off its base on 10 September 2003.]]

''[[The Little Mermaid (statue)|The Little Mermaid]]'' is a statue of the mermaid from the [[The Little Mermaid|fairy tale of the same name]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]. The statue is located in the harbor of [[Copenhagen]] and is an icon and a major [[tourist attraction]] of the city. The statue has been damaged and defaced so many times since the mid-1950s that in 2007, Copenhagen officials announced that the statue may be moved further out in the harbor to avoid further vandalism and to prevent tourists from climbing onto it.

The main focus of vandalism for the statue has been [[decapitation]].  On 24 April 1964, the statue's head was sawn off and stolen by politically oriented artists of the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movement. The head was never recovered and a new head was produced and attached to the statue.&lt;ref name=m3/&gt; On 6 January 1998, the statue was decapitated again;&lt;ref name=m1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/45721.stm|date=8 January 1998 | work=BBC News | title=Feminists claim responsibility for statue attack}}&lt;/ref&gt; the culprits were never found, but the head was returned anonymously to a nearby TV station, and re-attached on 4 February.

On the night of 10 September 2003, the statue was knocked off its base with explosives and later found in the harbor's waters. Holes were blasted in the mermaid's wrist and knee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3103906.stm Little Mermaid's unexpected swim], BBC News, 12 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Paint has been poured on the statue several times, including one episode in 1963 and two in March and May 2007. On 8 March 2006, green paint was poured over the statue and a [[dildo]] was attached to its hand.&lt;ref name=m3&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/reise/europa/0,1518,druck-572601,00.html Alter schützt Meerjungfrau nicht vor Rabauken (Age does not protect against Mermaid bullies)].

(in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acid and paint ==
{{see also|Hans-Joachim Bohlmann}}
In 1880, exhibits of the Russian painter [[Vasily Vereshchagin]] in [[Vienna]] caused the opposition of the Catholic Church, which culminated in an attack on two paintings, ''Holy family'' ({{lang-ru|Святое семейство}}) and ''Resurrection'' ({{lang-ru|Воскресение Христово}}). A monk splashed enough acid on the paintings to virtually destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centre.smr.ru/win/artists/veresh/biogr_veresh.htm Peaceful painter]. centre.smr.ru (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Tony Shafrazi]] wrote "KILL LIES ALL" with red spray paint over the work ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' by [[Pablo Picasso]]. Shafrazi was ostensibly protesting [[Richard Nixon]]'s pardon of [[William Calley]] for the latter's actions during the [[My Lai massacre]]. The paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman, J. (13 December 2004) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050301174151/http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20041213&amp;s=hoberman&amp;c=1 "Pop and Circumstance"]. ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', pp. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 1985, Rembrandt's 17th-century painting ''[[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Danaë]]'' was attacked in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in Russia. A man, later judged insane, first threw [[sulfuric acid]] on the canvas and then cut it twice with a knife. The entire central part of the composition was virtually destroyed.&lt;ref name="Sluijter"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sluijter |first=Eric Jan |authorlink= |title=Rembrandt and the Female Nude |publisher=Amsterdam University Press |year=2006 |page=221 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8FFH0vMv3DYC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=978-90-5356-837-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration took 12&amp;nbsp;years, between 1985 and 1997; since then, the painting has been protected with an armored glass.&lt;ref&gt;Tylyakova, A. (1 November 1997) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120401143628/http://zn.ua/CULTURE/vozvraschenie_shedevra_rembrandta-9061.html ВОЗВРАЩЕНИЕ ШЕДЕВРА РЕМБРАНДТА] (Return of the Rembrandt's masterpiece). ''Зеркало недели'' #44, zn.ua&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Alexander Brener]] painted a green dollar sign on [[Kazimir Malevich]]'s painting [[:File:Suprematist Composition - Kazimir Malevich.jpg|''Suprematisme'']]. The painting was restored and Brener was sentenced to 5&amp;nbsp;months in prison. During the court case, he said in his defense:&lt;ref&gt;Battersby, Matilda (8 October 2012) [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/art-attacks-from-vomiting-on-mondrian-to-elbowing-a-picasso-1879312.html?action=Popup&amp;ino=10 Art attacks: From pissing in Duchamp's 'Fountain' to defacing a Rothko]. ''Independent.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The cross is a symbol of suffering, the dollar sign a symbol of trade and merchandise ... What I did was not against the painting. I view my act as a dialogue with Malewitz.}}

In 2012, Uriel Landeros spray painted a bull and wrote "Conquista" with black spray paint over the work ''[[Woman in a Red Armchair]]'' by Pablo Picasso. He was charged with felony graffiti and [[criminal mischief]] and sentenced to two years in prison.

In 2017, a [[2017 Paris machete attack|terror suspect attacked guards of the Louvre museum with machetes]] and was found carrying "bombs of aerosol paint" intended to "disfigure the masterpieces of the museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Emilie Blachère|title=Attack at the Louvre: the tourist was a terrorist|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Attaque-au-Louvre-le-touriste-etait-un-terroriste-1184744|accessdate=13 February 2017|work=Paris Match|date=13 February 2017|language=French|quote=Investigators found bombs of aerosol paint in his bag.

On 16 January 1913, a 29-year-old [[iconographer]] Abram Balashev attacked the painting [[Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan|''Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan'']] by [[Ilya Repin]] in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in Moscow. With three knife blows, he cut through the faces of both Ivans. Balashev was found mentally ill and restricted to a psychiatric hospital. The painting was restored by two leading Russian experts within a week; the work was greatly assisted by the availability of good-quality photographs of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rusk.ru/st.php?idar=25141 Scene of Blood, or how Ilya Repin killed Tsarevich Ivan.

On 10 March 1914, militant suffragette [[Mary Richardson]] walked into the [[National Gallery]] of London and attacked [[Diego Velázquez]]'s painting ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' with a [[meat cleaver]]. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] the previous day,&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davies, Christie|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Vel-zquez-in-London-2567 |title=Velazquez in London|journal=New Criterion|volume= 25|issue= 5|date=January 2007|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there had been earlier warnings of a planned attack on the collection.

In September 1969, unidentified persons left long scratches in five paintings at the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]], with most damage inflicted to the [[:File:Lorenzo Costa - De heilige familie.jpg|''Holy Family'']] by [[Lorenzo Costa]].&lt;ref&gt;5 schilderijen in Rijksmuseum zijn beschadigd door onbekenden A'dam: schilderij "De heilige Familie van Lorenzo Costa is het meest beschadigd.

On 6 April 1978, a 31-year-old Dutch artist, disgruntled over the non-payment of his welfare by the Amsterdam authorities, made three 30–40&amp;nbsp;cm long cuts in the center of the painting ''[[:File:Vincent Willem van Gogh 084.jpg|La Berceuse]]'' by [[Vincent van Gogh]] at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. A few days earlier, a 27-year-old Italian man slashed the painting ''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'' by [[Nicolas Poussin]] at the [[National Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name=c1978&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19780406&amp;id=D-4wAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2eAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1116,1817631 Van Gogh Painting Slashed].

In 1986, a man "wishing to take revenge on abstract art" cut with a knife the painting ''[[Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue]] III'' by [[Barnett Newman]]. The restoration took 5&amp;nbsp;years and cost $450,000. After serving time in prison, the offender slashed another Newman painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who's Afraid of Corporate Culture: The Barnett Newman Controversy|author=Anderson-Reece, Erik |journal=The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|volume=51|issue=1|year=1993|pages=49–57|jstor=431970|doi=10.2307/431970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rather unusual case, which might not qualify as vandalism, occurred in 1908. An exhibition was set up for May of that year with paintings by [[Claude Monet]], which had already been praised by critics and were estimated at $100,000 (1908 prices). Despite this, Monet decided that he was not satisfied with his work and in a sudden move destroyed all the paintings with a knife and a paint brush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956949,00.html Monet's Rage of Perfectionism], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Smashing and shattering ==

On 7 February 1845, the [[Portland Vase]], a [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[cameo glass]] vase dated to between 5 and 25&amp;nbsp;BCE, was shattered by a drunken William Lloyd while on display in the [[British Museum]]. The vase was pieced together and underwent several further repairs, all not entirely successful. The vase's appearance became satisfactory only after its most recent restoration in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120202011228/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/c/portland_vase_-_conservation.aspx The conservation history of the Portland Vase], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 1991, a "deranged" man attacked the statue ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] with a hammer he had concealed under his jacket,&lt;ref&gt;"a man the police described as deranged broke part of a toe with a hammer, saying a 16th century Venetian painter's model ordered him to do so."

''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|La Pietà]]'', another work by Michelangelo, is a 1499 example of [[Renaissance]] sculpture housed in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Vatican City. On 21 May 1972, mentally disturbed geologist [[Laszlo Toth]], aged 33, attacked the statue with a hammer while yelling "I am Jesus Christ!", chipping the Virgin Mary's left eyelid, neck, head, veil and left forearm; the forearm fell on the floor, causing the fingers to break. Most broken pieces were collected by the service people but some were taken by tourists. The sculpture was repaired and is now protected by bulletproof glass. Toth was not charged with a crime, but was found socially dangerous and confined for two years to a psychiatric institution in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1956922_1956921_1956949,00.html Michelangelo's Pietà], ''Time'', 26 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2565,00.html Whatever happened to Laszlo Toth, the man who smashed Michelangelo's Pieta in 1972?] ''Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gamboni|Gamboni]], p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2018, Repin's painting ''Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan'' was vandalized again. A 37-year-old drunken man grabbed a metal stand and repeatedly hit the painting, shattering its protection glass, seriously damaging the original wooden frame, and tearing the central part of the canvas. Fortunately, the most important details of the work, that is, heads and hands of the tzar and his son, were unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/5238382 В Третьяковке вандал нанес серьезные повреждения картине Репина "Иван Грозный".

== Lipstick ==

In 1912, a young woman kissed the forehead, eyes and nose of a portrait by [[François Boucher]] in the Louvre. She reportedly wanted to draw attention to herself.&lt;ref name=g192&gt;[[#Gamboni|Gamboni]], p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, 43-year-old Ruth van Herpen kissed a painting by [[Jo Baer]] at the Oxford Museum of Modern Art, claiming to try cheering up a "cold" painting. She was ordered by law to pay the restoration costs of $1,260.&lt;ref name=g192/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Shell (21 June 2008). [http://www.toptenz.net/top-10-famous-kisses.php Top 10 famous kisses].

On 19 July 2007, police arrested artist Rindy Sam after she kissed the all-white canvas of ''Phaedrus'' by [[Cy Twombly]], leaving a red lipstick mark. The artwork, which was worth an estimated $2,830,000, was on display at the Museum of Contemporary Art in [[Avignon]], France. First attempts to remove the mark using about 30 various chemicals were unsuccessful. Sam was tried in a court in Avignon for "voluntary degradation of a work of art". She defended herself by saying to the court: "It was just a kiss, a loving gesture. I kissed it without thinking; I thought the artist would understand... It was an artistic act provoked by the power of Art". In November 2007, Sam was convicted and ordered to pay €1,000 to the painting's owner, €500 to the Avignon gallery that showed it, and €1 to the painter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/21211300 French court tries woman for kissing painting].

==Firearms==
In July 1987, a man named Robert Cambridge entered the [[National Gallery]] in London with a sawn-off shotgun concealed under his coat. He then shot the drawing ''[[The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist]]'' by Leonardo da Vinci from a distance of about 2&amp;nbsp;meters (7&amp;nbsp;feet). The pellets did not penetrate the protective glass, but shattered it, and the splinters caused significant damage to the artwork. Cambridge told the police that he wanted to express his disgust with "political, social and economic conditions in Britain"; he was placed in a mental institution. The restoration of the drawing took more than a year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/arts/restoring-a-leonardo-drawing-that-was-hit-by-a-shotgun-blast.html Restoring a Leonardo Drawing That Was Hit by a Shotgun Blast], ''New York Times'',
