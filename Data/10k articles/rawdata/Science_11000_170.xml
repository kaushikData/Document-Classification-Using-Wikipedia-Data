'''AS-105''' was the fifth and final orbital flight of a [[boilerplate (spacecraft)|boilerplate]] [[Apollo spacecraft]], and the third and final launch of a [[Pegasus (satellite)|Pegasus micrometeroid detection satellite]]. It was launched by '''SA-10''', the tenth and final [[Saturn I]] rocket, in 1965.

== Overview ==
AS-105 was an [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] spacecraft; boilerplate BP-9A was used for the flight. The spacecraft reentered on November 22, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturni.htm | title=Saturn I | accessdate=February 28, 2011 | publisher=Astronautix | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207080648/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/saturni.htm | archivedate=December 7, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saturn launch vehicle (SA-10) was similar to those of missions AS-103 and AS-104.  As on the previous mission, the boilerplate service module was equipped with a test installation of a reaction control engine package.

The primary flight objective was to continue demonstration of the launch vehicle's iterative guidance mode and evaluation of system accuracy.

== Launch ==
AS-105 was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy]] Launch Complex 37B at 08:00 EST (13:00 GMT) on July 30, 1965, on the last Saturn I rocket, SA-10. A planned thirty-minute hold ensured that launch time coincided with the opening of the [[Pegasus (satellite)|Pegasus]] launch window. The launch was normal and the payload was inserted into orbit approximately 10.7 minutes after lift-off. The total mass placed in orbit, including the spacecraft, Pegasus spacecraft, adapter, instrument unit, and [[S-IV]] stage, was 34,438 pounds (15,621&amp;nbsp;kg).

The spacecraft was separated 812 seconds after lift-off. The separation and ejection system operated as planned. The [[Pegasus 3]] spacecraft, which was attached to the S-IV stage of the Saturn I and stowed inside the boilerplate service module, was deployed 40 seconds after command initiation at 872 seconds. Pegasus 3 was a 1423.6&amp;nbsp;kilogram (3138.6 pound) micrometeoroid detection satellite, which was bolted to the S-IV.

The term is often used for a group that authors are studying in further detail in order to refine the complex taxonomy.

Historically, some 19th century botanical authors used alliance to denote groups that would now be considered [[Order (biology)|orders]]. This usage is now obsolete, and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|ICN]] (Article 17.2) specifies that such taxa are treated as orders.

[[File:Mona lisa crowd.jpg|thumb|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' is the most popular attraction of [[the Louvre]]]]


The '''art world''' comprises everyone involved in producing, commissioning, presenting, [[Historic preservation|preserving]], promoting, chronicling, [[Art criticism|criticizing]], and selling [[fine art]].  

==Descriptions==
''Art world'' is indeed a wider term than [[art market]], though that is a large part of it.  [[Howard S. Becker]] describes it as "the network of people whose cooperative activity, organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things, produce(s) the kind of art works that art world is noted for" (Becker, 1982). In her book, ''Seven Days in the Art World'', Sarah Thornton describes it as "a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art. They span the globe but [[Art cluster|cluster]] in art capitals like New York, London, Los Angeles, and Berlin."&lt;ref name="Thornton"&gt;Thornton 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities sometimes called "art capitals" include Beijing, Brussels, Hong Kong, Miami, Paris, Rome and Tokyo; due to their large art festivals, followings, and being the centers of art production.{{citation needed (lead)|date=August 2016}}

The notion of the singular ''art world'' is problematic, since Becker &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;[[Howard S. Becker|Becker, Howard S.]] ''Art Worlds''. [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]: [[University of California]] Press, 1982. {{ISBN|0-520-05218-8}}. Cited in Sanjeck (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and others show art worlds are, instead, independent multiplicities scattered worldwide that are always in flux: there is no "center" to the art world any more. In her analysis of the "net art world" (referring to network-aided art or [[net art]]), Amy Alexander states "net.art had a movement, at the very least it had coherence, and although it aimed to subvert the art world, eventually its own sort of art world formed around it. It developed a culture, hype and mystique through lists and texts; it had a centre, insiders, outsiders, even nodes.  This is of course not a failure; this is unavoidable: groups form; even anarchism is an institution." &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, Amy. ''net art history'' (2001) [http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0102/msg00223.html Nettime.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
Art worlds exist at local and regional levels, as hidden or obscured subcultures, via primary and secondary art markets, through gallery circuits, around design movements, and, esoterically, as shared or perceived experiences. 

The one globalized, all-encompassing art world exists only as myth; rather, there are multiplicities of intersecting, overlapping, self-similar art worlds, each expressing different views of the world as they see it.

''[[Whitehot Magazine]]'' artist/publisher [[Noah Becker]] has published over 3500 articles about the Art World."&lt;ref&gt; Becker, Noah. [http://Whitehotmagazine.com His art magazine called Whitehot Magazine has taken the top spot as one of the only art magazines left in the world. &lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New York Magazine]]'' art critic [[Jerry Saltz]] has referred to [[William Powhida]]'s and Jade Townsend's drawing ''Art Basel Miami Beach Hooverville'' as "a great big art-world stinkbomb."&lt;ref&gt;Saltz, Jerry. [http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/03/saltz_william_powhida_is_makin.html "William Powhida Is Making Fun of Me, And I Love It"]. ''New York Magazine''. 9 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  This is misleading nonsense as written
==Theory==
The term "art world" is  a product of the Institutional [[theory of art]]. It originates with the [[theorн of American art|theories of American art]] critic and [[philosopher]] [[Arthur Danto]]. In 1964 Danto published an essay "The Artworld," in which the term "artworld" was coined, meaning cultural context or "an atmosphere of art theory".&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/&lt;/ref&gt; It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]]'s institutional theory of art." Dickie defines an art work as an artefact "which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)" (p. 43.)&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The central core of Danto’s "The Artworld" is "artistic theory", which elevates things to the world of art (or art world). 

Danto writes: "these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so. And part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories, so that one use of theories, in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest, consists in making art possible" (Danto, The Artworld, p. 3).--&gt;

== Areas of research ==
Arvanitaki's work has focused on finding novel experiments to explore topics in theoretical physics. Her work has been described as working at the "precision frontier" as it involves measuring very small variations in well-understood phenomena to illuminate theoretical predictions.&lt;ref name="GandM" /&gt; 

In 2016, Arvanitaki, [[Savas Dimopoulos]] and [[Ken Van Tilburg]] proposed a method of detecting dark matter as a matter wave, using conventional gravitational wave detectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arvanitaki|first=Asimina|last2=Dimopoulos|first2=Savas|last3=Van Tilburg|first3=Ken|date=2016-01-22|title=Sound of Dark Matter: Searching for Light Scalars with Resonant-Mass Detectors|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.031102|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=116|issue=3|pages=031102|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.031102}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has proposed using the [[LIGO|Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory]]  to observe the gravitational waves from black hole collisions to detect the presence of [[Axion|QCD axions]], a candidate for explaining dark matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arvanitaki|first=Asimina|last2=Baryakhtar|first2=Masha|last3=Dimopoulos|first3=Savas|last4=Dubovsky|first4=Sergei|last5=Lasenby|first5=Robert|date=2017-02-08|title=Black hole mergers and the QCD axion at Advanced LIGO|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.95.043001|journal=Physical Review D|volume=95|issue=4|pages=043001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.95.043001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also proposed using neutrino and gamma-ray telescopes, such as the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|Fermi telescope]], [[High Energy Stereoscopic System|Hess]], or [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|IceCube]], to search for dark matter decay products predicted by certain theories of super-symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arvanitaki|first=Asimina|last2=Dimopoulos|first2=Savas|last3=Dubovsky|first3=Sergei|last4=Graham|first4=Peter W.|last5=Harnik|first5=Roni|last6=Rajendran|first6=Surjeet|date=2009-09-09|title=Decaying dark matter as a probe of unification and TeV spectroscopy|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.80.055011|journal=Physical Review D|volume=80|issue=5|pages=055011|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.80.055011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and early career ==
Arvanitaki pursued her post-doctoral research at [[Stanford University]]. She joined the Perimeter Institute in 2014.&lt;ref name="GandM" /&gt; She is the first woman to hold a named chair at the institute. Arvanitaki suggested naming the chair for [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]] — the ancient Greek astronomer who surmised that the Earth rotated around the sun centuries before Coperniucs — in a nod to the cosmological scope of her research, the Greek background of the [[Stavros Niarchos Foundation]], and her own Greek origin.&lt;ref name="GandM" /&gt;

'''Astrobotic Technology''' is an American [[privately held company]] that is [[new product development|developing]] [[space robotics]] technology for planetary missions. It was founded in 2008 by [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] professor [[Red Whittaker]] and his associates, with the goal of winning the [[Google Lunar X Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astrobotic Technology and Raytheon Collaborate to Pursue Google Lunar X Prize|url=http://www.lunarexplorers.net/node/386|publisher=lunarexplorers.net|accessdate=2008-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

In 2012, the company signed collaborations with Carnegie Mellon University, International Rectifier, Ansys, AGI, Alcoa, and Caterpillar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partners |url=http://astrobotic.net/partners/ |publisher=Astrobotic |accessdate=12 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810125011/http://astrobotic.net/partners/ |archivedate=10 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2015|3|6}} in 2015 it started a collaboration with the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.astrobotic.com/2015/11/17/dlr-and-astrobotic-establish-partnership|title=DLR and Astrobotic Establish Partnership {{!}} Astrobotic|website=www.astrobotic.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2016 it signed a collaboration agreement with [[Airbus Defence and Space]] and with [[DHL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.astrobotic.com/2016/6/2/dhl-and-airbus-defence-and-space-support-astrobotic-to-develop-lunar-delivery-service|title=DHL and Airbus Defence and Space Support Astrobotic to Develop Lunar Delivery Service {{!}} Astrobotic|website=www.astrobotic.com|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The team articulated an ambitious goal from the start in 2008:  they hoped to be the first commercial operation to land their spacecraft "Red Rover" on the Moon, using the lander, named "Artemis Lander".&lt;ref name=msnbc20080222&gt;
{{cite web |title=Private race to the moon (and money) takes off |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23278871/page/2/ |publisher=msnbc.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2011-02-08 |quote=''Astrobotic: Headed by William 'Red' Whittaker of Carnegie Mellon University, the team expects their 'Artemis Lander' and 'Red Rover' spacecraft to touch down first on the moon.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its formation, Astrobotic has maintained a spot in the top three rankings for Evadot's third-party Google Lunar X Prize Scorecard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doornbas |first=Michael |title=Google Lunar X Prize Team Scorecard / Scoreboard |url=http://evadot.com/glxpscorecard/ |publisher=Evadot |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001160951/http://evadot.com/glxpscorecard/ |archivedate=1 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's first running prototype of Red Rover was completed the same year, and on July 28, 2008, NASA awarded Astrobotic funding for its "Regolith Moving Methods" proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Awards Contracts for Concepts of Lunar Surface Systems|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/jul/HQ_C0848_Lunar_surface_contract_prt.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Astrobotic began to receive a series of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding from NASA totaling over $795,000 to investigate prospecting for lunar resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Contract to Astrobotic Technology Investigates Prospecting for Lunar Resources |url=http://astrobotic.net/2012/04/23/nasa-contract-to-astrobotic-technology-investigates-prospecting-for-lunar-resources/ |publisher=Astrobotic |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630152324/http://astrobotic.net/2012/04/23/nasa-contract-to-astrobotic-technology-investigates-prospecting-for-lunar-resources/ |archivedate=30 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2010, NASA awarded a contract to Astrobotic for Innovative Lunar Demonstrations Data (ILDD) firm-fixed price indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contracts with a total value up to $30.1 million over a period of up to five years, and in December, NASA's $500,000 ILDD project for further Lunar Demonstrations Data was awarded to Astrobotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Selects Companies for Further Lunar Demonstrations Data|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/dec/HQ_10-344_ILDD_Selections_prt.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally named "Red Rover" and "Artemis Lander", respectively,&lt;ref name=msnbc20080222/&gt; Astrobotic indicated in 2011 that they were reserving naming rights, as well as selection of the planned location for the lunar landing, for their payload customers. "We have to sell a lot of payload to make the economics work, ... the customers will decide where we go".&lt;ref name=aw20110208/&gt; Later, the rover continued to be called "Red Rover" and the lander was now called "Griffin".

Astrobotic's "Technologies Enabling Exploration of Skylights, Lava Tubes, and Caves", was a phase one selection for [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 NIAC Phase I Selections|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/niac/2011_phase1_selections.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, Astrobotic received a $599,000 two-year contract to develop a scalable gravity offload device for testing rover mobility in simulated lunar gravity under NASA's Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Awards Contract for Lunar Gravity Simulation Device |url=http://astrobotic.net/2011/04/21/nasa-awards-contract-for-lunar-gravity-simulation-device/ |publisher=Astrobotic |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514070418/http://astrobotic.net/2011/04/21/nasa-awards-contract-for-lunar-gravity-simulation-device/ |archivedate=14 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, David Gump left the position of President of Astrobotic and John Thornton took the reins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newspacejournal.com/2012/05/31/transitions-for-two-space-entrepreneurs/ |title=Transitions for two space entrepreneurs |work=NewSpace Journal |date=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2014, [[NASA]] announced that Astrobotic Technologies was one of the three companies selected for the [[Lunar CATALYST]] initiative.&lt;ref name=CATALYST_release&gt;{{cite web|title=RELEASE 14-126 NASA Selects Partners for U.S. Commercial Lander Capabilities|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasa-selects-partners-for-us-commercial-lander-capabilities/#.U2RX1KIXJDw|work=NASA.GOV website|publisher=NASA|accessdate=May 3, 2014|date=April 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NASA is negotiating a 3-year no-funds-exchanged Space Act Agreement (SAA). The Griffin Lander may be involved.&lt;ref name=CATALYST_page&gt;{{cite web|title=About Lunar CATALYST|url=http://www.nasa.gov/lunarcatalyst/#.U2RcWaIXJDy|work=NASA.GOV website|publisher=NASA|accessdate=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2016, Astrobotic Technology announced a new design of its lunar lander, ''[https://www.astrobotic.com/''peregrine'' Peregrine]'', along with two new industry collaborators. [https://airbusdefenceandspace.com/ Airbus Defence and Space] signed a memorandum of understanding to provide engineering support for Astrobotic as it refines the lander's design, which Thornton said is approaching a preliminary design review. "For us at Airbus Defence and Space, the Moon is a very important topic," said Bart Reijnen, senior vice president of on-orbit services and exploration at Airbus Defence and Space. "Astrobotic is what we see as being the frontrunner in the world of commercial lunar transportation."

Astrobotic also announced a separate agreements with shipping company [http://www.dhl.com/en.html DHL], which will serve as the official logistics provider for Astrobotic. DHL will provide shipping for components of the spacecraft, and for the completed ''Peregrine'' lander from Astrobotic's facilities to the launch pad. "Moreover, we also see potential opportunities to develop the partnership further in the future, and explore how we can integrate our activities even more creatively with Astrobotic," said Arjan Sissing, senior vice president of corporate brand marketing at DHL. He said later that could include supporting "extraterrestrial logistics in regard to Moon projects of the future."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spacenews.com/astrobotic-unveils-peregrine-lunar-lander/|title=Astrobotic unveils Peregrine lunar lander - SpaceNews.com|date=2016-06-03|newspaper=SpaceNews.com|access-date=2017-02-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016 Astrobotic slipped their estimated launch date to 2019 and separated from the [[Google Lunar X Prize]].&lt;ref name="Astro_leave_XPrize"&gt;{{cite web |last1=John Thornton |title=Graduating from the Google Lunar X Prize |url=http://www.spacenewsmag.com/commentary/graduating-from-the-google-lunar-x-prize |website=Space News Mag |accessdate=December 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017 NASA extended its Lunar CATALYST agreement for 2 years.&lt;ref name="LCAT_20171031"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Erin Mahoney |title=NASA Extends Agreements to Advance Commercial Lunar Landers |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-extends-agreements-to-advance-commercial-lunar-landers |website=NASA.GOV |accessdate=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 29, 2018 Astrobotic was awarded a [[Commercial Lunar Payload Services]] contract by [[NASA]], which makes it eligible to bid on delivering science and technology payloads to the Moon for NASA.&lt;ref name="CLPS_win"&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Announces New Partnerships for Commercial Lunar Payload Delivery Services |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-announces-new-partnerships-for-commercial-lunar-payload-delivery-services |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial payload pricing ===

By 2010, the company had priced payload carried to the lunar surface at {{convert|700000|$/lb}} with an additional ''per-payload'' fee of {{Currency|250000|US}} "to cover the cost of integration and to provide communications, power, thermal control and pointing services".&lt;ref name=aw20110208/&gt;

By 2011, Astrobotic had raised the payload price and made a distinction between payload fixed to the lander and payload carried on the lunar rover. The revised baseline prices are {{convert|1200000|$/kg}} for lander payload and {{convert|2000000|$/kg}} for rover payload, with the additional integration fee unchanged at {{Currency|250000|US}} ''per-payload''.&lt;ref name=at20110411&gt;

Beyond the standard inclusions of 300 Watt-hours of power, and 100 MB of data transfer, per kilogram of mass purchased, pricing has been established for the purchase of additional power or Lunar-to-Earth data transfer.&lt;ref name="atUGv2.4-20110817"/&gt;

== Lunar missions ==

In April 2011, Astrobotic contracted with [[SpaceX]] for a [[Falcon 9]] launch on a lunar mission for as early as December 2013.  The mission was intended to "deliver a lander, small [[Lunar rover|rover]] and up to about {{convert|240|lb}} of payload to the surface of the Moon".&lt;ref name="aw20110208"&gt;{{cite news |title=SpaceX Lands Contract To Fly To Moon |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=space&amp;id=news/asd/2011/02/08/01.xml&amp;headline=SpaceX%20Lands%20Contract%20To%20Fly%20To%20Moon |accessdate=2011-02-08 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=2011-02-08 |quote=''Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology, a Carnegie Mellon University spin-off company, has signed a launch services contract with Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) for a Falcon 9 rocket to deliver a lander, small rover and up to about 240 lb. of payload to the surface of the Moon''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A payload user's guide for researchers on preparation of their instruments was released in early March 2011.&lt;ref name="xpf20110303"&gt;{{cite web |title=Astrobotic's Mission to the Moon Releases Payload User's Guide |url=http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/lunar/teams/astrobotic/blog/astrobotics-mission-to-the-moon-releases-payload-users-guide |publisher=X Prize Foundation |accessdate=2011-03-05 |date=2011-03-03 |quote=''To get their sensors and experiments to the lunar surface, researchers have had to propose entire missions to space agencies such as NASA or the European Space Agency. ... This initiative allows engineers and scientists to focus on just their own instruments, with Astrobotic providing the delivery and support utilities like power and communications. They can buy just what they need from us by the pound, watt, and byte.'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Astrobotic stated that follow-on lunar missions were tentatively planned for 2015 and 2016. Both to be flown on [[Falcon 9]] launch vehicles, with the same ''total'' mission payload as the first mission: {{convert|210|kg|lb}}, or {{convert|110|kg|lb}} customer payload if the {{convert|100|kg|lb}} rover is included on the mission. The 2015 mission was named ''Polar Excavator'' (now ''Icebreaker''), would target the lunar north pole, and was nominally planned for July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Icebreaker: Prospecting the Moon |url=http://astrobotic.net/icebreaker-prospecting-the-moon/ |publisher=Astrobotic |accessdate=12 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522160313/http://astrobotic.net/icebreaker-prospecting-the-moon/ |archivedate=22 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition's rover was to be Polaris. By 2011, the 2016 mission was to be customer-driven, and land at a destination that was to be selected by the customer.&lt;ref name=atUG20110410&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Lander &amp; Rover Payload Userís Guide Version 2.1 |work=Mission manifest |publisher=Astrobotic Technology |quote=''Mission Launch Date Vehicle(s) Landing Site Payload  Moon Cruiser December 2013 Falcon 9 / Lander / Rover An Apollo Site 110 kg  Polar Excavator July 2015 Falcon 9 / Lander / Rover South Pole 110 kg Customer Driven Q3 2016 Falcon 9 / Lander / [Rover] Customer Driven 210 [110] kg ...

By August 2011, per version 2.4 of the User's Guide, there had been two small changes to the mission manifest with the first mission now aimed for either an Apollo site or a skylight entrance to a [[Lunar lava tube|lava tube]], and the launch date was changed to a range: December 2013 to April 2014.&lt;ref name="atUGv2.4-20110817"&gt;

By October 2011, Astrobotic had delayed the lunar mission launch date to "late 2014 or early 2015", indicating that they were still under contract to SpaceX for a Falcon 9 mission.&lt;ref name=fox20111027&gt;
{{cite news |last=Grush|first=Loren |title=Race to Mine the Moon Heats Up |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/10/27/race-to-mine-moon-heats-up/ |accessdate=2012-01-22 |newspaper=Fox News |date=2011-10-27 |quote=''planned to launch in late 2014 or early 2015'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2012 the Astrobotic mission on the SpaceX Falcon 9 was rescheduled for October 2015. In October 2015, a ''Polaris'' rover was to carry out the same or similar tasks to NASA's [[RESOLVE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resolve Rover|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/ground/resolverover.html|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbt20120529&gt;{{cite news |last=Specner|first=Malia |title=SpaceX success brings Pittsburgh space startup closer to mission |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2012/05/29/spacex-success-brings-pittsburgh-space.html |accessdate=2012-05-31 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Business Times |date=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A model of the Polaris rover was unveiled in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astrobotic Unveils Lunar Polar Robot |url=http://astrobotic.net/2012/10/08/astrobotic-unveils-lunar-polar-robot/ |accessdate=10 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014174643/http://astrobotic.net/2012/10/08/astrobotic-unveils-lunar-polar-robot/ |archivedate=14 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By February 2015, Astrobotic further delayed the Moon mission to the second half of 2016, but then contracted with two other GLXP teams including Team [[Hakuto]] and [[Team AngelicvM]].  The agreement was to launch the rovers of all teams on a single [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9]] which would then use the Astrobotic ''Griffin'' lander to touch down on the surface of the Moon.

In June 2016, Astrobotic unveiled the ''Peregrine'' lunar lander, which is a smaller version of ''Griffin'', a lander Astrobotic has previously proposed for lunar missions. Among the differences between the two designs is a change in propulsion. While ''Griffin'' uses a single large thruster, ''Peregrine'' uses a cluster of five ISE-100 thrusters, built by [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] and based on the Divert and Attitude Control System thrusters it developed for missile defense applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In July 2017, Astrobotic announced an agreement had been reached with United Launch Alliance (ULA) to launch the first ''Peregrine'' lander aboard an [[Atlas V]].

'''Astrolinguistics''' is a field of [[linguistics]] connected with the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI).

== Early Soviet experiments ==

Arguably the first attempt to construct a language for interplanetary communication was made by the anarchist philosopher Wolf Gordin (brother of [[Abba Gordin]]) in his books ''Grammar of the Language of the Mankind AO'' (1920) and ''Grammar of the Language AO'' (1923)&lt;ref&gt;[http://dumka.be/sites/default/files/files/files/volf_gordin_-_grammatika_yazyka_ao_-_1923.pdf Wolf Gordin. Grammar of the Language AO (1923) (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. The ''AO'' language was presented at the First international exhibition of interplanetary machines and mechanisms (dedicated to the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the 70th anniversary of the birth of [[Tsiolkovsky]]) in Moscow, 1927 as a language for interplanetary travels&lt;ref&gt;Michael G. Smith. Rockets and Revolution: A Cultural History of Early Spaceflight. University of Nebraska Press, 2014. P. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;. The declared goal of Gordin was to construct a language which would be non-"fetishizing", non-"sociomorphic", non-gender based and non-[[Class discrimination|classist]]. The design of the language was inspired by the [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futuristic poetry]], brothers Gordins' pan-anarchist philosophy and early Tsiolkovsky's remarks on possible cosmic messaging (which were in accord with later Freudenthal's insights)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/hel_0750-8069_1995_num_17_2_2419 Kuznecov S. Linguistica cosmica: La naissance du paradigme cosmique // Une familière étrangeté: La linguistique russe et soviétique. Paris, 1995 (Histoire Épistémologie Langage. 17/11 (Tome XVII - fascicule 2)), p. 211-234.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Freudenthal's LINCOS==
{{main|Lincos (artificial language)}}
An integral part of the SETI project in general is research in the field of the construction of messages for extraterrestrial intelligence, possibly to be transmitted into space from Earth. As far as such messages are based on linguistic principles, the research can be considered to belong to astrolinguistics. The first proposal in this field was put forward by the mathematician [[Hans Freudenthal]] at the [[University of Utrecht]] in the [[Netherlands]], in 1960 – around the time of the first SETI effort at Greenbank in the US. Freudenthal conceived a complete Lingua Cosmica. His book ''[[Lincos (artificial language)|LINCOS: Design of a Language for Cosmic Intercourse]]'' seems at first sight non-linguistic, because mathematical concepts are the core of the language.  The concepts are, however, introduced in conversations between persons (''Homo sapiens''), de facto by linguistic means. This is witnessed by the innovative examples presented. The book set a landmark in astrolinguistics. This was witnessed by Bruno Bassi's review years later. Bassi noted: “LINCOS is there. In spite of its somewhat ephimeral 'cosmic intercourse' purpose it remains a fascinating linguistic and educational construction, deserving existence as another Toy of Man's Designing”.

==Ollongren's LINCOS==
The concept astrolinguistics in scientific research was coined as such, also with a view towards message construction for ETI, in 2013 in the monograph  ''Astrolinguistics: Design of a Linguistic System for Interstellar Communication Based on Logic'', written by the astronomer and computer scientist [[Alexander Ollongren]], [[University of Leiden]], The Netherlands. This book presents a new Lingua Cosmica totally different from Freudenthal's design. It describes the way the logic of situations in human societies can be formulated in the lingua, also named LINCOS. This astrolinguistic system, also designed for use in interstellar communication, is based on modern constructive logic – which assures that all expressions are verifiable. At a deeper, more fundamental level, however, astrolinguistics is concerned with the question whether linguistic universalia can be identified which are potentially useful in communication across interstellar distances between intelligence species. In the view of the new LINCOS these might be certain logic descriptions of specific situations and relations (possibly in an Aristotelian sense). Kadri Tinn's (Astronomy for Humans) review of Ollongren's book recognised that aspect – she wrote:

{{Quote|Astrolinguistics is the study of interstellar languages and possibility of communication using an artificially created language that is self-contained and wouldn't include some of the aspects of natural languages. … new Lingua Cosmica is a language system based on applied logic, the understanding of which might be expected from a civilization that has developed technology advanced enough to receive radio emissions.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4238">The '''Azoic hypothesis''' (sometimes referred to as the '''Abyssus theory''') is a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]] proposed by [[Edward Forbes]] in 1843, stating that the abundance and variety of [[marine life]] decreased with increasing depth and, by [[extrapolation]] of his own measurements, Forbes calculated that marine life would cease to exist below {{convert|300|fathom}}.

==Overview==
The theory was based upon Forbes' findings aboard HMS ''Beacon'', a [[survey ship]] to which he had been appointed [[Natural history|naturalist]] by the ship's commander Captain [[Thomas Graves (1802–1856)|Thomas Graves]]. With Forbes aboard, HMS ''Beacon'' set sail around the [[Aegean Sea]] on 17 April 1841, from [[Malta]]. It was at this point that Forbes began to take [[dredging]] samples at various depths of the ocean, he observed that samples from greater depths displayed a narrower diversity of creatures which were generally smaller in size.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Forbes reported his findings from the Aegean Sea in his 1843 report to the [[British Science Association|British Association]] entitled ''Report on the Mollusca and Radiata of the Aegean Sea''. His findings were widely accepted by the scientific community and were bolstered by other scientific figures of the time. [[David Page (geologist)|David Page]] (1814–1879), a respected [[geologist]], confounded the theory by stating that "according to experiment, water at the depth of 1000 feet is compressed {{frac|1|340}}th of its own bulk; and at this rate of compression we know that at great depths animal and vegetable life as known to us cannot possibly exist – the extreme depressions of seas being thus, like the extreme elevations of the land, barren and lifeless solitudes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Text-Book of Geology|last=Page|first=David|publisher=William Blackwood|year=1867|isbn=1314059149|location=Edinburgh|pages=20|quote=‘According to experiment, water at the depth of 1000 feet is compressed 1/340th of its own bulk; and at this rate of compression we know that at great depths animal and vegetable life as known to us cannot possibly exist – the extreme depressions of seas being thus, like the extreme elevations of the land, barren and lifeless solitudes’|via=Physical Copy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Metacrinus rotundus by OpenCage.JPG|thumb|Crinoids have been found at depths of up to {{convert|4900|fathom}}, far deeper than the maximum depth of Forbes's theory]]
The theory was not disproven until the late 1860s&lt;ref name="noc"&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Deep-Sea Image and Video Library|url=http://archive.noc.ac.uk/deepseascape/history.php|website=archive.noc.ac.uk|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when biologist [[Michael Sars]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Deserts on the sea floor: Edward Forbes and his azoic hypothesis for a lifeless deep ocean|journal=Endeavour|volume= 30| issue = 4|date= December 2006|doi=10.1016/j.endeavour.2006.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Zoology at [[University of Oslo|Christiania]] (now Oslo) University, discovered life at a depth greater than 300 fathoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbuch zur Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik|last=Darmstaedter|first=Ludwig|publisher=Springer|year=1908|isbn=|location=Berlin|pages=541|quote=|via=Open Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sars listed 427 animal species which had been found along the Norwegian coast at a depth of 450 fathoms, and gave a description of a [[crinoid]] ''Rhizocrinus lofotensis'' which his son had recovered from a depth of 300 fathoms in [[Lofoten]].&lt;ref name="noc"/&gt;
In 1869, [[Charles Wyville Thomson]] dredged marine life from a depth of {{convert|2345|fathom}}, finally dispelling Forbes' azoic theory.&lt;ref name="noc"/&gt;

In light of this evidence, the Azoic hypothesis would come to be seen as a false [[hypothesis]] and give way to vastly increased efforts in [[deep-sea exploration]] and associated marine life. Since being discredited, the theory has been referenced widely in [[popular culture]], such as Keble Ball 2017 and alluded to in documentaries that explore and showcase deep-sea marine life.

'''''Brain Games''''' is a [[popular science]] [[television series]] that explores [[cognitive science]] by focusing on [[illusion]]s, [[psychological experiment]]s, and [[counterintuitive]] thinking. [[Neil Patrick Harris]] was the unseen narrator in the first season, replaced by [[Jason Silva]] for the remainder of the series as its host and presenter; in addition, [[sleight-of-hand]] artist [[Apollo Robbins]] has been a frequent consultant and illusionist guest on the show. The show is interactive, encouraging television viewers, often along with a handful of live volunteers, to engage in visual, auditory, and other cognitive experiments, or "brain games", that emphasize the main points presented in each episode. The series debuted on the [[National Geographic Channel]] in 2011 as a special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brain Games - About|url=http://natgeotv.com/uk/brain-games/about|publisher=Nat Geo|year=2013|accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its return as an original series in 2013 set a record for the highest premiere rating for any National Geographic Channel original series with 1.5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-brain-games-premiere-444723|title=TV Ratings: 'Brain Games' Premiere Sets Nat Geo Record|last=O'Connell|first=Michael|date=April 23, 2013|publisher=hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321174311/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-brain-games-premiere-444723|archivedate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Season 7 aired in 2016.

[[Image:CajuputEssOil.png|thumb|Cajeput essential oil in clear glass vial. Each oil may have different colors, either yellowish, clear, or greenish]]

'''Cajuput oil''' is a [[volatile oil]] obtained by distillation from the leaves of the [[Myrtaceae|myrtaceous]] trees ''[[Melaleuca leucadendra]]'', ''[[Melaleuca cajuputi]]'', and probably other ''[[Melaleuca]]'' species. The trees yielding the oil are found throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and over the hotter parts of the [[Australia]]n continent. The majority of the oil is produced on the Indonesian island of [[Sulawesi]]. The name “cajeput” is derived from its Indonesian name, “''kayu putih''” or "white wood".

The oil is prepared from leaves collected on a hot dry day, macerated in water, and distilled after fermenting for a night. This oil is extremely pungent, and has the odor of a mixture of [[turpentine]] and [[camphor]]. It consists mainly of [[cineol]] (see [[terpene]]s), from which cajuputene, having a [[hyacinth (plant)|hyacinth]]-like odor, can be obtained by distillation with [[phosphorus pentoxide]]. It is a typical volatile oil, and is used internally in doses of 2 to 3 [[Minim (unit)|minims]], for the same purposes as, say, [[oil of clove|clove oil]]{{Clarify|date=December 2017}}{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. It is frequently employed externally as a [[counterirritant]]. It is an ingredient in some [[heat rub|liniments for sore muscles]] such as [[Tiger Balm]] and Indonesian traditional medicine [[Minyak Telon]].

It is also used as an ingredient in inhalants/decongestants and topical pain/inflammation remedies such as [[Olbas Oil]].

== Historical note ==
In October 1832 while in the port of [[Manila]], the Asiatic or spasmodic [[cholera]] suddenly made its appearance on board the [[USS Peacock (1828)]]. The first case was in a sailor named Peterson, sixty-three years old. The surgeon administered six grains of [[opium]], in three doses; bad symptoms increasing, fifteen drops of cajeput oil were given in brandy and water, and repeated in half an hour. This treatment, however, apparently did not help the patient; Peterson died about eleven hours after being stricken, as did seven others, of "the terrific and appalling effects produced by one of the greatest scourges that ever visited the world."&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book |last= Roberts|first= Edmund |authorlink= |title= Embassy to the Eastern courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat : in the U.

== For fish ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
Cajeput is used for the treatment of bacterial or fungal infections in fish. Common brand names containing Cajeput are [[Melafix]] and [[Bettafix]]. Melafix is a stronger concentration and Bettafix is a lower concentration that makes it harder to overdose smaller fish, especially [[betta]]s. It is most commonly used to promote [[fin]] and tissue regrowth, but is also effective in treating other conditions, such as [[fin rot]] or [[Velvet (fish disease)|velvet]]. The remedy is used mostly on [[betta fish]].

The '''chief services officer''' ('''CSO''') is a position at the head of a firm carrying significant service design responsibilities. The CSO typically is responsible for developing processes and tools, both internally and externally, for producing maximum value to all stakeholders with intelligent and efficient use of potentially fluctuating human resources.

In some organizations, the same person may hold this title along with that of [[chief operations officer]] (COO) as they both are same level roles. Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, a CSO exists in heavily client-focussed companies, while a COO exists in [[product development]] focused companies. A CSO almost always has a strong operations background and advanced degree, whereas a COO often has a background in business development. Both CSO and COO report to the [[CEO]] or managing director of a company.

By comparison, Russian [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] expendable cargo launchers (Atlas V rocket counterpart), still largely based on the design that dates back to 1965, are said to cost as little as $110 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/ils-may-pitch-proton-cost-saver-over-soyuz-galileo-satellites|title=ILS May Pitch Proton as Cost-saver Over Soyuz for Galileo Satellites}}&lt;/ref&gt; or around $5,000/kg (approximately $2,300 per pound) to LEO.

When all design and maintenance costs are taken into account, the final cost of the Space Shuttle program, averaged over all missions and adjusted for inflation, was estimated to come out to $1.5 billion per launch, or $60,000/kg (approximately $27,000 per pound) to LEO.&lt;ref name=duggins&gt;[http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2656-2008.18.pdf ''The Rise and Fall of the Space Shuttle''], Book Review: Final Countdown: NASA and the End of the Space Shuttle Program by Pat Duggins, American Scientist, 2008, Vol. 96, No. 5, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; This should be contrasted with the originally envisioned costs of $118 per pound of payload in 1972 dollars (approximately ${{Inflation|US|118|1972|2011}} per pound adjusting for inflation to 2011).&lt;ref name="century_of_flight"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.century-of-flight.net/Aviation%20history/space/Space%20Shuttle%20history.htm|title=Space Shuttle history - Shuttle operations|publisher=Century of Flight|accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It failed in the goal of achieving reliable access to space, partly due to multi-year interruptions in launches following Shuttle failures.&lt;ref name="Folly"&gt;{{cite book|last=Axelrod|first=Alan|title=[[Profiles in Folly]]: History's Worst Decisions and Why They Went Wrong|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company|year=2008|pages=62–63|isbn=978-1-4027-4768-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA budget pressures caused by the chronically high NASA Space Shuttle program costs have eliminated NASA manned space flight beyond low earth orbit since Apollo, and severely curtailed use of unmanned probes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Handberg|first=Roger|title=Reinventing NASA: Human Spaceflight, Bureaucracy, and Politics|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2003|isbn=978-0-275-97002-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's promotion of and reliance on the Shuttle slowed domestic commercial [[expendable launch vehicle]] (ELV) programs until after the 1986 [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Launius|first=Roger D.|author2=Howard E.

==Purpose of the system==
"Space Transportation System" (NASA's formal name for the overall Shuttle program) was created to transport crewmembers and payloads into [[low Earth orbit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_overview.html |title=Space Transportation System |publisher=NASA KSC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would afford the opportunity to conduct science experiments on board the shuttle to be used to study the effects of space flight on humans, animals and plants. Other experiments would study how things can be manufactured in space. The shuttle would also enable astronauts to launch satellites from the shuttle and even repair satellites already out in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wings.avkids.com/Book/History/advanced/stations-01.html|title=The Space Shuttle and Space Stations|date=1997-09-06|publisher=The K–8 Aeronautics Internet Textbook|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shuttle was also intended for research into the human response to [[zero-g]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-02-04-shuttle-critics_x.htm |title=Critics scrutinize cost of shuttle |accessdate=2008-09-26 |date=2003-02-04 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shuttle was originally billed as a space vehicle that would be able to launch once a week and give low launch costs through [[amortization]]. Development costs were expected to be recouped through frequent access to space. These claims were made in an effort to obtain budgetary funding from the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lardas|first=Mark|author2=Ian Palmer|title=Space Shuttle Launch System 1972–2004: System 1975–2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-691-1|page=7|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1981, the space shuttle began to be used for space travel. However, by the mid-1980s the concept of flying that many shuttle missions proved unrealistic and scheduled launch expectations were reduced 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Space_Shuttle.html|title=Space Shuttle|publisher=The Internet Encyclopedia of Science|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'']] accident in 1986, missions were halted pending safety review. This hiatus became lengthy and ultimately lasted almost three years as arguments over funding and the safety of the program continued. Eventually the military resumed the use of expendable launch vehicles instead.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt; Missions were put on hold again after the loss of ''Columbia'' in 2003. Overall, 135 missions were launched during the 30 years after the first orbital flight of ''Columbia'', averaging approximately one every 3 months.

==Costs==
Some reasons for the higher-than-expected operational costs were:
* The final design differed from the original concept, causing, among other things, the shuttle orbiter to be almost 20% over its specified weight – resulting in it being unable to boost the US Air Force's payloads into [[polar orbit]]s.&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=Shuttle|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/shuttle.htm|accessdate=2010-05-24|date=1997–2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maintenance of the thermal protection tiles was a very labor-intensive and costly process, with some 35,000 tiles needing to be inspected individually and with each tile specifically manufactured for one specific slot on the shuttle.&lt;ref name="Van Pelt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Pelt|first=Michael|title=Space tourism: adventures in Earth's orbit and beyond|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-40213-0|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s (SSMEs) were highly complex and maintenance-intensive, necessitating removal and extensive inspection after each flight. Before the "Block II" engines, the [[turbopump]]s (a primary engine component) had to be removed, disassembled, and totally overhauled after each flight. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* The toxic propellants used for the [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS/RCS thrusters]] required special handling, during which time no other activities could be performed in areas sharing the same ventilation system. This increased turn-around time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
* The launch rate was significantly lower than initially expected. While not reducing absolute operating costs, more launches per year gives a lower cost per launch. Some early hypothetical studies examined 55 launches per year (see above), but the maximum possible launch rate was limited to 24 per year based on manufacturing capacity of the [[Michoud Assembly Facility|Michoud facility]] that constructs the [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]]. Early in shuttle development, the expected launch rate was about 12 per year.&lt;ref name="columbia_hearing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caib.nasa.gov/events/public_hearings/20030423/transcript_am.html |title=Columbia accident investigation board, public hearing |date=23 April 2003 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2006-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812151208/http://caib.nasa.gov/events/public_hearings/20030423/transcript_am.html |archivedate=2006-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Launch rates reached a peak of 9 per year in 1985 but averaged fewer thereafter.
* When the decision was made on the main shuttle contractors in 1972, work was spread among companies to make the program more attractive to Congress, such as the contract for the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|Solid Rocket Booster]]s to [[Morton Thiokol]] in Utah. Over the course of the program, this raised operational costs,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} though the consolidation of the US aerospace industry in the 1990s meant the majority of the Shuttle was now with one company: the [[United Space Alliance]], a joint venture of [[Boeing]] and [[Lockheed Martin]].

==Cultural issues and problems==
{{Quotation|For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.|[[Richard Feynman]]|[[Rogers Commission Report]], on the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]].}}
Some researchers have criticized a pervasive shift in NASA culture away from safety in order to ensure that launches took place in a timely fashion, sometimes called "[[go fever]]". Allegedly, NASA upper-level management embraced this decreased safety focus in the 1980s while some engineers remained wary. According to sociologist [[Diane Vaughan]], the aggressive launch schedules arose in the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] years as a way to rehabilitate America's post-[[Vietnam]] prestige.&lt;ref name=vaughn&gt;{{cite book| last=Vaughan| first=Diane| title=The Challenger Launch Decision: Risky Technology, Culture, and Deviance at NASA| publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]| year=1996| isbn=978-0-226-85175-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who was appointed to the [[Rogers Commission|official inquiry on the ''Challenger'' disaster]], estimated the risk to be "on the [[order of magnitude|order]] of a percent" in his report, adding, "Official management, on the other hand, claims to believe the probability of failure is a thousand times less. One reason for this may be an attempt to assure the government of NASA perfection and success in order to ensure the supply of funds. The other may be that they sincerely believed it to be true, demonstrating an almost incredible lack of communication between themselves and their working engineers."&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{cite web| url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt| title=Personal observations on the reliability of the Shuttle| last=Feynman| first=Richard |publisher=[[NASA]]| work=[[Rogers Commission Report]]| accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Feynman's warnings, and despite the fact that Vaughan served on safety boards and committees at NASA, the subsequent press coverage has found some evidence that NASA's relative disregard for safety might persist to this day. For example, NASA discounted the risk from small foam chunk breakage at launch and assumed that the lack of damage from prior foam collisions suggested the future risk was low.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Shuttle operations==
[[File:SpaceShuttleGroundProcessingVision.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The original, simplified, vision of Space Shuttle ground processing]]
[[File:SpaceShuttleGroundProcessingActual.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Actual, vastly more complex and much slower, Space Shuttle ground processing]]
The Shuttle was originally conceived to operate somewhat like an airliner. After landing, the orbiter would be checked out and start "mating" to the rest of the system (the ET and SRBs), and be ready for launch in as little as two weeks. Instead, this turnaround process usually took months; [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']] set the pre-''Challenger'' record by launching twice within 54 days, while [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] set the post-''Challenger'' record of 88 days. Naturally, the Shuttle program's goal of returning its crew to Earth safely conflicts with the goal of a rapid and inexpensive payload launch. Furthermore, because in many cases there are no survivable [[Space Shuttle abort modes|abort modes]], many pieces of hardware simply must function perfectly and so must be carefully inspected before each flight. The result is high labor cost, with around 25,000 workers in Shuttle operations and labor costs of about $1 billion per year.&lt;ref name="century_of_flight" /&gt;

Some shuttle features initially presented as important to Space Station support have proved superfluous:
* As the Russians demonstrated, capsules and unmanned supply rockets are sufficient to supply a space station.
* NASA's initial policy of using the Shuttle to launch all unmanned payloads declined in practice, and eventually was discontinued. [[Expendable launch vehicles]] (ELVs) proved much cheaper and more flexible.
* Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, use of the Shuttle to carry the powerful [[liquid rocket|liquid fueled]] [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stages planned for interplanetary probes was ruled out for Shuttle safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.satobs.org/faq/Chapter-08.txt|title=Visual Satellite Observing |chapter= Chapter 8: What Are Some Of The Rockets Used To Place Satellites In Orbit?|date=February 1998|publisher=Visual Satellite Observer's Home Page|accessdate=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/SPACEFLIGHT/upper_stages/SP12.htm|title=Upper Stages|publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission|accessdate=16 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527224252/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/SPACEFLIGHT/upper_stages/SP12.htm|archivedate=27 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Shuttle's history of unexpected delays also makes it liable to miss narrow [[launch window]]s.
* Advances in technology have made probes smaller and lighter.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}&lt;!--dubious: there are still massive probes --&gt; As a result, many robotic probes and communications satellites can now use [[expendable launch vehicle]]s, such as the [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] and [[Atlas V]], which are less expensive and perceived to be more reliable than the Shuttle.

==Accidents==

[[File:Challenger STS-51-L-launch.jpg|thumb|SRB O-ring "blow by" is what caused the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' accident]]]]
While the technical details of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'']] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'']] accidents are different, the organizational problems show similarities. Flight engineers' concerns about possible problems were not properly communicated to or understood by senior NASA managers. The vehicle gave ample warning beforehand of abnormal problems. A heavily layered, procedure-oriented bureaucratic structure inhibited necessary communication and action.

With ''Challenger'', an [[O-ring]] that should not have eroded at all did erode on earlier shuttle launches. Yet managers felt that because it had previously eroded by no more than 30%, this was not a hazard as there was "a factor of three [[safety factor|safety margin]]". [[Thiokol|Morton-Thiokol]] designed and manufactured the SRBs, and during a pre-launch conference call with NASA, [[Roger Boisjoly]], the Thiokol engineer most experienced with the O-rings, pleaded with management repeatedly to cancel or reschedule the launch. He raised concerns that the unusually low temperatures would stiffen the O-rings, preventing a complete seal during flexing of the rocket motor segments, which was exactly what happened on the fatal flight. However, Thiokol's senior managers, under pressure from NASA management, overruled him and allowed the launch to proceed. One week prior to the launch, Thiokol's contract to reprocess the solid rocket boosters was also due for review, and cancelling the flight was an action that Thiokol management wanted to avoid. ''Challenger'''s O-rings eroded completely through as predicted, resulting in the complete destruction of the spacecraft and the loss of all seven astronauts on board.

[[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'']] was destroyed because of damaged [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection]] from foam debris that broke off from the [[external tank]] during ascent. The foam had not been designed or expected to break off, but had been observed in the past to do so without incident. The original shuttle operational specification said the orbiter [[Thermal Protection System|thermal protection tiles]] were not designed to withstand any debris hits at all. Over time NASA managers gradually accepted more tile damage, similar to how O-ring damage was accepted. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board|''Columbia'' Accident Investigation Board]] called this tendency the "[[normalization of deviance]]" –  a gradual acceptance of events outside the design tolerances of the craft simply because they had not been catastrophic to date.&lt;ref name="CAIBREP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/default.html | title=''Columbia'' Accident Investigation Board Report | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916094919/http://caib.nasa.gov/news/report/default.html | archivedate=2007-09-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:STS-1 Columbia Cargo Bay.jpg|thumb|STS-1 photo showing missing thermal tiles (left and right of tail fin)]]
The subject of missing or damaged thermal tiles on the Shuttle fleet only became an issue following the loss of ''Columbia'' in 2003, as it broke up on [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry]]. In fact, Shuttles had previously come back missing as many as 20 tiles without any problem. [[STS-1]] and [[STS-41]] had all flown with missing thermal tiles from the [[orbital maneuvering system]] pods (visible to the crew).

This image from the NASA archives shows several missing tiles on the STS-1 OMS pods. The problem on ''Columbia'' was that the damage was sustained from a foam strike to the [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] leading edge panel of the wing, not the heat tiles. The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding gap filler that diverted hot gas into the right wheel well on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing gear door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/news/columbia/anomaly/STS1.pdf | title= STS-1 In Flight Anomaly List | date=2003-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrospect==
While the system was ''developed'' within the original cost and time estimates given to President [[Richard M. Nixon]] in 1971, the operational costs, flight rate, payload capacity, and reliability by the time of the February 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' accident]] proved to be much worse than originally anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caib.nasa.gov/events/public_hearings/20030423/transcript_am.html |title=''Columbia'' Accident Investigation Board public hearing |date=2003-04-23 |publisher=NASA – ''Columbia'' Accident Investigation Board |accessdate=2008-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016135918/http://caib.nasa.gov/events/public_hearings/20030423/transcript_am.html |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year before [[STS-1]]'s April 1981 launch, ''[[The Washington Monthly]]'' accurately forecast many of the Shuttle's issues, including an overambitious launch schedule and the consequently higher-than-expected marginal cost per flight; the risks of depending on the Shuttle for all payloads, civilian and military; the lack of a survivable abort scenario if a Solid Rocket Booster were to fail; and the fragility of the Shuttle's thermal protection system.&lt;ref name="easterbrook198004"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/8004.easterbrook-fulltext.html | title=Beam Me Out Of This Death Trap, Scotty | work=The Washington Monthly | date=April 1980 | accessdate=15 September 2016 | author=Easterbrook, Gregg | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030203074859/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/8004.easterbrook-fulltext.html | archivedate=2003-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="day20110627"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1872/1 | title=Gazing back through the crystal ball | work=The Space Review | date=2011-06-27 | accessdate=June 27, 2011 | author=Day, Dwayne Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to get the Shuttle approved, NASA over-promised its economies and utility. To justify its very large fixed operational program cost, NASA initially forced all domestic, internal, and [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] payloads to the shuttle. When that proved impossible (after the ''Challenger'' disaster), NASA used the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) as a justification for the shuttle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/21/space-shuttle-programme|title=The space shuttle programme has been a multi-billion-dollar failure|author=Krauss, Lawrence|date=2011-07-21|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2013-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=September 2018}} speculate that, had NASA avoided the Shuttle program and instead continued to use [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn]] and commercially available boosters, costs might have been lower, freeing funds for manned exploration and more unmanned space science.  In particular, [[NASA administrator]] [[Michael D. Griffin]] argued in a 2007 paper that the Saturn program, if continued, could have provided six manned launches per year &amp;mdash; two of them to the Moon &amp;mdash; at the same cost as the Shuttle program, with an additional ability to loft infrastructure for further missions:
{{quote|If we had done all this, we would be on Mars today, not writing about it as a subject for “the next 50 years.” We would have decades of experience operating long-duration space systems in Earth orbit, and similar decades of experience in exploring and learning to utilize the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviationweek.typepad.com/space/2007/03/human_space_exp.html|title=Human Space Exploration:The Next 50 Years|date=2007-03-14|publisher=Aviation Week|accessdate=2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some had argued that the Shuttle program was flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-09-27-nasa-griffin-interview_x.htm|title=NASA administrator says space shuttle was a mistake |last=Watson|first=Traci|date=2005-09-30|publisher=''USA Today|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving a reusable vehicle with early 1970s technology forced design decisions that compromised operational reliability and safety. Reusable main engines were made a priority. This necessitated that they not burn up upon atmospheric reentry, which in turn made mounting them on the orbiter itself (the one part of the Shuttle system where reuse was paramount) a seemingly logical decision. However, this had the following consequences:{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* a more expensive 'clean sheet' engine design was needed, using more expensive materials, as opposed to existing and proven off-the-shelf alternatives (such as the Saturn V mains);
* increased ongoing maintenance costs related to keeping the reusable SSMEs in flying condition after each launch, costs which in total may have exceeded that of building disposable main engines for each launch.

A concern expressed by the 1990 [[Advisory Committee on the Future of the United States Space Program|Augustine Commission]] was that "the civil space program is overly dependent upon the Space Shuttle for access to space." The committee pointed out, "that it was, for example, inappropriate in the case of ''Challenger'' to risk the lives of seven astronauts and nearly one-fourth of NASA's launch assets to place in orbit a communications satellite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/augustine/racfup2.htm |title=Report of the Advisory Committee On the Future of the U.S. Space Program, Executive Summary |date = December 1990|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some [[NASA spin-off technologies]] related to the Space Shuttle program which have been successfully developed into commercial products, such as using heat-resistant materials developed to protect the Shuttle on reentry, in suits for municipal and aircraft rescue firefighters.&lt;ref name=Spinoff1978&gt;{{cite book

[https://books.google.com/books?id=UDAwZQO8ZGUC&amp;pg=SA15-PA7&amp;lpg=SA15-PA7&amp;dq=define:coefficient+of+discharge&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2mXq9FXJUT&amp;sig=x_YGCLqbpRbmPNy9iwSUvXjDhRs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XcUqUIqPJeeO6gHJ8oDoBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=define%3Acoefficient%20of%20discharge&amp;f=false (Google books)]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the ratio of the [[mass flow rate]] at the discharge end of the [[nozzle]] to that of an ideal nozzle which expands an identical [[working fluid]] from the same initial conditions to the same exit pressures.

Mathematically the discharge coefficient may be related to the mass flow rate of a fluid through a straight tube of constant cross-sectional area through the following
: &lt;math&gt;C_\text{d} = \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho\dot{V}} = \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho Au} = \frac{\dot{m}}{\rho A \sqrt{\frac{2\Delta P}{\rho}}} = \frac{\dot{m}}{A \sqrt{2\rho\Delta P}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;C_\text{d} = \frac{Q_\text{exp}}{Q_\text{theo}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;C_\text{d}&lt;/math&gt;, discharge coefficient through the constriction (dimensionless).
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt;, mass flow rate of fluid through constriction (mass per time).
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, density of fluid (mass per volume).
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt;, volumetric flow rate of fluid through constriction (volume per time).
:&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, cross-sectional area of flow constriction (area).
:&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; , velocity of fluid through constriction (length per time).
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt;, pressure drop across constriction (force per area).

This parameter is useful for determining the irrecoverable losses associated with a certain piece of equipment (constriction) in a fluid system, or the "resistance" that piece of equipment imposes upon the flow.

This flow resistance, often expressed as a dimensionless parameter, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the discharge coefficient through the equation:
: &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{C_\text{d}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

which may be obtained by substituting &lt;math&gt;\Delta P&lt;/math&gt; in the aforementioned equation with the resistance, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, multiplied by the [[dynamic pressure]] of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;.

== An example in open channel flow ==

Due to complex behavior of fluids around some of the structures such as orifices, gates, and weirs etc., some assumptions are made for the theoretical analysis of the stage-discharge relationship. For example, in case of gates, the pressure at the gate opening is non-hydrostatic which is difficult to model; however, it is known that the pressure at the gate is very small. Therefore, engineers assume that the pressure is zero at the gate opening and following equation is obtained for discharge:
: &lt;math&gt;Q = A_0\sqrt{2gH_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: Q, discharge
: &lt;math&gt;A_0&lt;/math&gt;, area of flow
: g, acceleration due to gravity
: &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;, head just upstream of the gate

However, the pressure is not actually zero at the gate; therefore, discharge coefficient, ''C''{{sub|d}} is used as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;Q = C_\text{d} A_0\sqrt{2gH_1}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">'''Duverney fractures''' are isolated [[pelvic fracture]]s involving only the [[Ilium (bone)|iliac wing]]. They are caused by direct trauma to the iliac wing, and are generally stable fractures as they do not disrupt the [[weight bearing]] pelvic ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medcyclopaedia.com/library/topics/volume_iii_1/d/duverney_fracture.aspx|title=Duverney fracture|publisher=[[General Electric|GE]]|work=Medcyclopaedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fracture is named after the [[France|French]] surgeon [[Guichard Joseph Duverney|Joseph Guichard Duverney]] who described the injury in his book ''Maladies des Os'' which was published posthumously in 1751.&lt;ref name="amr"/&gt;

==Presentation==
=== Complications ===
Malunion and [[deformity]] of the iliac wing can occur. Injury to the [[internal iliac artery]] can occur, leading to [[hypovolemia|hypovolaemic]] [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]. [[Gastrointestinal perforation|Perforation]] of the [[Colon (anatomy)|bowel]] can occur, leading to [[sepsis]].&lt;ref name="orthopaedia"/&gt; Damage to the adjacent nerves of the [[lumbosacral plexus]] has also been described.&lt;ref name="amr"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Amr |first1= SM |last2=Abdel-Meguid |first2= KMS |last3= Kholeif |first3= AM |date=February 2002 |title= Neurologic injury caused by fracture of the iliac wing (Duverney’s Fracture): Case report |journal= Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection &amp; Critical Care

== Diagnosis ==
Duverney fractures can usually be seen on pelvic [[Radiography|X-rays]], but CT scans are required to fully delineate the fracture and to look for associated fractures involving the pelvic ring.&lt;ref name="orthopaedia"/&gt;

== Management ==
Since fractures that do not involve the weight bearing part of the pelvic ring tend to be stable fractures, they can often be managed without surgery. These fractures tend to be very painful, so walking aids such as [[crutch]]es or [[Walker (mobility)|walking frames]] may be needed until the pain settles.&lt;ref name="orthopaedia"/&gt;

[[Open reduction internal fixation]] is sometimes required to correct deformity,&lt;ref name="tile"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fractures of the Pelvis and Acetabulum|last=Tile|first=Marvin|author2=David Helfet |author3=James Kellam |year= 2003|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-3213-0|pages=263–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and surgery may be required if there is damage to blood vessels, nerves or organs, or if the fracture is open.&lt;ref name="orthopaedia"&gt;[http://www.orthopaedia.com/display/Main/Iliac+wing+fractures Iliac wing fractures] at Orthopaedia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elysium Mons''' is a [[volcano]] on [[Mars]] located in the volcanic province [[Elysium (volcanic province)|Elysium]], at {{Coord|25.02|N|147.21|E|globe:Mars_type:mountain_source:gpn}}, in the Martian eastern hemisphere. It stands about {{convert|13.9|km|ft|abbr=on}} above the surrounding lava plains, and about {{convert|16|km|ft|abbr=on}} above the [[Areography|Martian ''datum'']]. Its diameter is about {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=on}}, with a summit [[caldera]] about {{convert|14|km|mi|abbr=on}} across. It is flanked by the smaller volcanoes [[Hecates Tholus]] to the northeast, and [[Albor Tholus]] to the southeast.

==Discovery==
Elysium Mons was discovered in 1972 in images returned by the [[Mariner 9]] orbiter.

==Terrestrial analog==
The terrestrial volcano [[Emi Koussi]] (in [[Chad]]) has been studied as an analog of Elysium Mons. The two shield volcanoes have summit calderas of similar size, but Elysium Mons is 3.5 times larger in diameter and 6 times higher than its counterpart on Earth.

==Possible source of nakhlites==
A 6.5 km diameter crater at 29.674 N, 130.799 E, in the volcanic plains to the northwest of Elysium Mons has been identified as a possible source for the [[nakhlite]] meteorites, a family of similar basaltic [[Martian meteorite]]s with cosmogenic ages of about 10.7 Ma, suggesting ejection from Mars by a single impact event. The dates of the igneous rocks of the nakhlites range from 1416 ± 7 Ma to 1322 ± 10 Ma. These dates plus the crater dimensions suggest a growth rate of the source volcano during that interval of 0.4–0.7 m per Ma, far slower than would be expected for a terrestrial volcano. This implies that Martian volcanism had slowed greatly by that point in history.&lt;ref name="Cohen2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Cohen|first1=B. E.|last2= Mark|first2=D. F.|last3= Cassata|first3=W.

'''Explorer 47''', also known '''IMP-7''' and '''Interplanetary Monitoring Platform IMP-H''', was an [[United States|American]] [[satellite]] launched as part of [[Explorers program]]. Explorer 47 as launched on 23 September 1972 on [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], [[U.S.]], with an [[Delta rocket]]. Explorer 47 was the seventh satellite of the '''Interplanetary Monitoring Platform'''.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.astronautix.com/craft/imp.htm|title=IMP|accessdate=2018-06-19|publisher=Mark Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spacecraft and mission==
Explorer 47 continued the study begun by earlier IMP spacecraft of the [[Interplanetary space|interplanetary]] and [[magnetotail]] regions from a nearly [[circular orbit]], near 37 earth radii. This 16 sided drum-shaped spacecraft was {{convert|157|cm}} [[Height|high]] and {{convert|135|cm}} in [[diameter]]. It was designed to measure energetic particles, [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s. The spin axis was normal to the [[ecliptic]] plane, and the spin period was 1.3 s. The spacecraft was powered by solar cells and a chemical battery. Scientific data were telemetered at 1600 [[Bits per second|bps]] (with a secondary 400 bps rate available). 

The spacecraft was turned off on October 31, 1978.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

==Versions==

===GLIMMER 1.0===
First Version of GLIMMER "i.e., GLIMMER 1.0" was released in 1998 and it was published in the paper ''Microbial gene identification using interpolated Markov model''.&lt;ref name="Salzberg"/&gt; Markov models were used to identify microbial genes in GLIMMER 1.0. GLIMMER considers the local composition sequence dependencies which makes GLIMMER more flexible and more powerful when compared to fixed-order [[Markov model]].

There was a comparison made between [[interpolated]] Markov model used by GLIMMER and fifth order Markov model in the paper ''Microbial gene identification using interpolated Markov models''.&lt;ref name="Salzberg"/&gt; "GLIMMER algorithm found 1680 genes out of 1717 annotated genes in [[Haemophilus influenzae]] where fifth order [[Markov model]] found 1574 genes. GLIMMER found 209 additional genes which were not included in 1717 annotated genes where fifth order [[Markov model]] found 104 genes."'&lt;ref name="Salzberg"/&gt;

===GLIMMER 2.0===
Second Version of GLIMMER i.e., GLIMMER 2.0 was released in 1999 and it was published in the paper ''Improved microbial identification with GLIMMER''.&lt;ref name=Delcher&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Delcher | first1 = A. 
| last2 = Harmon | first2 = D. 
| last3 = Kasif | first3 = S. 
| last4 = White | first4 = O.

| title = Improved microbial gene identification with GLIMMER 
| journal = Nucleic Acids Research 
| volume = 27 
| issue = 23 
| pages = 4636–4641 
| year = 1999 
| pmid = 10556321 
| pmc = 148753 | doi=10.1093/nar/27.23.4636
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper&lt;ref name="Delcher"/&gt; provides significant technical improvements such as using interpolated context model instead of interpolated Markov model and resolving overlapping genes which improves the accuracy of GLIMMER.

[[Interpolated]] context models are used instead of [[interpolated]] Markov model which gives the flexibility to select any base. In interpolated Markov model probability distribution of a base is determined from the immediate preceding bases. If the immediate preceding base is irrelevant [[amino acid]] translation, interpolated Markov model still considers the preceding base to determine the probability of given base where as interpolated context model which was used in GLIMMER 2.0 can ignore irrelevant bases. False positive predictions were increased in GLIMMER 2.0 to reduce the number of false negative predictions. Overlapped genes are also resolved in GLIMMER 2.0.

Various comparisons between GLIMMER 1.0 and GLIMMER 2.0 were made in the paper ''Improved microbial identification with GLIMMER''&lt;ref name="Delcher"/&gt; which shows improvement in the later version. "Sensitivity of GLIMMER 1.0 ranges from 98.4 to 99.7% with an average of 99.1% where as GLIMMER 2.0 has a sensitivity range from 98.6 to 99.8% with an average of 99.3%. GLIMMER 2.0 is very effective in finding genes of high density. The parasite [[Trypanosoma brucei]], responsible for causing [[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]] is being identified by GLIMMER 2.0" &lt;ref name="Delcher"/&gt;

===GLIMMER 3.0===
Third version of GLIMMER, "GLIMMER 3.0" was released in 2007 and it was published in the paper ''Identifying bacterial genes and endosymbiont DNA with Glimmer''.&lt;ref name=Bratke&gt;{{Cite journal 
| last1 = Delcher | first1 = A. L.

| pmc =2387122 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paper describes several major changes made to the GLIMMER system including improved methods to identify coding regions and start [[genetic code|codon]]. Scoring of ORF in GLIMMER 3.0 is done in reverse order i.e., starting from stop codon and moves back towards the start codon. Reverse scanning helps in identifying the coding portion of the gene more accurately which is contained in the context window of IMM. GLIMMER 3.0 also improves the generated training set data by comparing the long-ORF with universal amino acid distribution of widely disparate bacterial genomes."GLIMMER 3.0 has an average long-ORF output of 57% for various organisms where as GLIMMER 2.0 has an average long-ORF output of 39%."&lt;ref name="Bratke"/&gt;

GLIMMER 3.0 reduces the rate of false positive predictions which were increased in GLIMMER 2.0 to reduce the number of false negative predictions. "GLIMMER 3.0 has a start-site prediction accuracy of 99.5% for 3'5' matches where as GLIMMER 2.0 has 99.1% for 3'5' matches. GLIMMER 3.0 uses a new algorithm for scanning coding regions, a new start site detection module, and architecture which integrates all gene predictions across an entire genome."&lt;ref name="Bratke"/&gt;

[[Minimum description length]]

=== Theoretical and Biological Foundation ===

The GLIMMER project helped introduce and popularize the use of variable length models in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics that subsequently have been applied to numerous problems such as protein classification and others.  Variable length modeling was originally pioneered by information theorists and subsequently ingeniously applied and popularized in data compression (e.g. Ziv-Lempel compression).  Prediction and compression are intimately linked using [[Minimum description length|Minimum Description Length]] Principles.    The basic idea is to create a dictionary of frequent words (motifs in biological sequences). The intuition is that the frequently occurring motifs are likely to be most predictive and informative.  In GLIMMER the interpolated model is a mixture model of the probabilities of these relatively common motifs.  Similarly to the development of HMMs in Computational Biology, the authors of GLIMMER were conceptually influenced by the previous application of another variant of interpolated Markov models to speech recognition by researchers such as Fred Jelinek (IBM) and Eric Ristad (Princeton). The learning algorithm in GLIMMER is different from these earlier approaches.

==Access==

GLIMMER can be downloaded from [http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/glimmer/index.shtml The Glimmer home page]  (requires a C++ [[compiler]]).
Alternatively, an online version is hosted by [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/MICROBES/glimmer_3.cgi].

==How it works==

1. GLIMMER primarily searches for long-[[open reading frame|ORFS]]. An open reading frame might overlap with any other open reading frame which will be resolved using the technique described in the sub section. Using these long-ORFS and following certain amino acid distribution GLIMMER generates [[training set]] data.

2. Using these training data, GLIMMER trains all the six Markov models of coding DNA from zero to eight order and also train the model for [[noncoding DNA]]

3. GLIMMER tries to calculate the probabilities from the data. Based on the number of observations, GLIMMER determines whether to use fixed order [[Markov model]] or [[interpolated]] Markov model.

    a. If the number of observations are greater than 400, GLIMMER uses fixed order Markov model to obtain there probabilities.

    b. If the number of observations are less than 400, GLIMMER uses [[interpolated]] Markov model which is briefly explained in the next sub section.

4. GLIMMER obtains score for every long-ORF generated using all the six coding DNA models and also using non-coding DNA model.

5. If the score obtained in the previous step is greater than a certain threshold then GLIMMER predicts it to be a gene.

The steps explained above describes the basic functionality of GLIMMER. There are various improvements made to GLIMMER and some of them are described in the following sub-sections.

===The GLIMMER system===

GLIMMER system consists of two programs. First program called build-imm, which takes an input set of sequences and outputs the [[interpolated]] Markov model as follows.

The probability for each base i.e., A,C,G,T for all [[k-mer]]s for 0 ≤ k ≤ 8 is computed. Then, for each [[k-mer]], GLIMMER computes weight. New sequence probability is computed as follows.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P(S/M)=\sum_{x=1}^n{IMM_8(S_x)}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where n is the length of the sequence &lt;math&gt; S_x &lt;/math&gt; is the [[oligomer]] at position x. &lt;math&gt; IMM_8(S_x) &lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt; 8^{th} &lt;/math&gt;-order [[interpolated]] Markov model score is computed as

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{IMM_k(S_x)= Y_k(S_{x-1})*P_k(S_x)+[1-{Y_k(S_(x-1)]*IMM_{k-1}(S_x)}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

"where &lt;math&gt; Y_k(S_{x-1}) &lt;/math&gt; is the weight of the [[k-mer]] at position x-1 in the sequence S and &lt;math&gt; P_k(S_x) &lt;/math&gt; is the estimate obtained from the training data of the probability of the base located at position x in the &lt;math&gt; k^{th} &lt;/math&gt;-order model."&lt;ref name="Salzberg"/&gt;

The probability of base &lt;math&gt; S_x &lt;/math&gt; given the i previous bases is computed as follows.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{P_i(S_x) =P(s_x/S_{x,j}) = f(S_{x,j})/\sum_{b e {[acgt]}}\operatorname{f(S_{x,i},b)}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

"The value of &lt;math&gt; Y_i(S_{x}) &lt;/math&gt; associated with &lt;math&gt; P_i(S_x) &lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a measure of confidence in the accuracy of this value as an estimate of the true probability. GLIMMER uses two criteria to determine &lt;math&gt; Y_i(S_{x}) &lt;/math&gt;. The first of these is simple frequency occurrence in which the number of occurrences of context string &lt;math&gt; S_{x,i} &lt;/math&gt;  in the training data exceeds a specific threshold value, then &lt;math&gt; Y_i(S_{x}) &lt;/math&gt; is set to 1.0. The current default value for threshold is 400, which gives 95% confidence. When there are insufficient sample occurrences of a context string, build-imm employ additional criteria to determine &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; value. For a given context string &lt;math&gt; S_{x,i} &lt;/math&gt; of length i, build-imm compare the observed frequencies of the following base &lt;math&gt; f(S_{x,i}, a) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; f(S_{x,i}, c) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; f(S_{x,i}, g) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; f(S_{x,i}, t) &lt;/math&gt; with the previously calculated  [[interpolated]] Markov model probabilities using the next shorter context, &lt;math&gt; IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, a) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, c) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, g) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; IMM_{i-1}(S_{x,{i-1}}, t) &lt;/math&gt;.  Using a &lt;math&gt; X^2 &lt;/math&gt; test, build-imm determine how likely it is that the four observed frequencies are consistent with the IMM values from the next shorter context."&lt;ref name="Salzberg"/&gt;

The second program called glimmer, then uses this IMM to identify putative gene in an entire genome. GLIMMER identifies all the [[open reading frame]] which score higher than threshold and check for overlapping genes. Resolving overlapping genes is explained in the next sub-section.

Equations and explanation of the terms used above are taken from the paper 'Microbial gene identification using interpolated Markov models''&lt;ref name="Salzberg"/&gt;''

===Resolving overlapping genes===

In GLIMMER 1.0, when two genes A and B overlap, the overlap region is scored. If A is longer than B, and if A scores higher on the overlap region, and if moving B's start site will not resolve the overlap, then B is rejected.

GLIMMER 2.0 provided a better solution to resolve the overlap. In GLIMMER 2.0, when two potential genes A and B overlap, the overlap region is scored. Suppose gene A scores higher, four different orientations are considered.

[[File:Case 1.png|thumb|center|Case 1]]

In the above case, moving of start sites does not remove the overlap. If A is significantly longer than B, then B is rejected or else both A and B are called genes, with a doubtful overlap.

[[File:Case2.png|thumb|center|Case 2]]

In the above case, moving of B can resolve the overlap, A and B can be called non overlapped genes but if B is significantly shorter than A, then B is rejected.

[[File:Case3.png|thumb|center|Case 3]]

In the above case, moving of A can resolve the overlap. A is only moved if overlap is a small fraction of A or else B is rejected.

[[File:Case4.png|thumb|center|Case 4]]

In the above case, both A and B can be moved. We first move the start of B until the overlap region scores higher for B. Then we move the start of A until it scores higher. Then B again, and so on, until either the overlap is eliminated or no further moves can be made.

The above example has been taken from the paper 'Identifying bacterial genes and endosymbiont DNA with Glimmer''''&lt;ref name="Bratke"/&gt;

===Ribosome binding sites===

[[ribosomal binding site|Ribosome binding site]](RBS) signal can be used to find true start site position. GLIMMER results are passed as an input for RBSfinder program to predict ribosome binding sites. GLIMMER 3.0 integrates RBSfinder program into gene predicting function itself.

ELPH software( which was determined as highly effective at identifying RBS in the paper&lt;ref name="Bratke"/&gt;) is used for identifying RBS and is available at this [http://cbcb.umd.edu/software/ELPH/ website]. [[Gibbs sampling]] algorithm is used to identify shared [[Sequence motif|motif]] in any set of sequences. This shared [[Sequence motif|motif]] sequences and their length is given as input to ELPH. ELPH then computes the position weight matrix(PWM) which will be used by GLIMMER 3 to score any potential RBS found by RBSfinder. The above process is done when we have a substantial amount of training genes. If there are inadequate number of training genes, GLIMMER 3 can bootstrap itself to generate a set of gene predictions which can be used as input to ELPH. ELPH now computes PWM and this PWM can be again used on the same set of genes to get more accurate results for start-sites. This process can be repeated for many iterations to obtain more consistent PWM and gene prediction results.

'''Gula Mons''' is a volcano in western [[Eistla Regio]] on [[Venus]]; it is {{convert|3|km|mi|sp=us}} high and located at approximately 22 degrees north latitude, 359 degrees east longitude.

==Topographic features==
Its main feature is a NE-SW-oriented rift-like fracture set connecting two summit calderas. There is also a structure which links the northern caldera and ridge system to Idem Kuva corona located NW of Gula Mons. Radially spreading lava flows which have digitate and broad sheet-like forms extend from the summit, including radar-dark flows which overlay several older lava deposits. Radial and circumferential fractures are present on the flanks.

'''Henry Cary''' (3 May 1908 – 20 December 1991) was an [[United States|American]] [[engineer]] and the co-founder of the [[Applied Physics Corporation]] (later known as Cary Instruments), along with [[George W. Downs]] and William Miller. The [[Cary 14 Spectrophotometer|Cary 14 UV-Vis-NIR]] and the Cary Model 81 Raman Spectrophotometer were particularly important contributions in scientific instrumentation and spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="Brock"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brock|first1=David C.|last2=Lukens|first2=Rob|title=Foundation's Focus: Find the 50|journal=Today's Chemist at Work|date=2004|issue=December|publisher=American Chemical Society|pages=14–21 |url=https://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/tcaw/13/i12/pdf/1204feature_brock.pdf|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before starting Applied Physics, Cary was employed by [[Beckman Instruments]], where he worked on the design of several instruments including the ubiquitous  [[DU spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name=Simoni&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simoni|first1=Robert D.|last2=Hill|first2=Robert L.|last3=Vaughan|first3=Martha|last4=Tabor|first4=Herbert|title=A Classic Instrument: The Beckman DU Spectrophotometer and Its Inventor, Arnold O.

==Personal life==
Henry Howard Cary was born on 3 May 1908 in [[Los Angeles, California]] to Henry Gardner Cary and Bessie (Brown) Cary.&lt;ref name="CHFHydra"&gt;{{cite web|title=Autobiography of Howard Cary|url=https://digital.sciencehistory.org/works/0r967383v|website=[[Science History Institute]] |accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref&gt;California Birth Index, 1905-1995.

==Education==
In 1925, after graduating from [[Los Angeles High School]], Cary entered the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bulletin of the California Institute of Technology|date=December 1925|publisher=California Institute of Technology|number=109|page=188|volume=XXXIV |url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/69/1/dec1925.pdf|accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed one year due to illness,&lt;ref name="CHFHydra"/&gt;{{rp|2}} and graduated in 1930 with a [[B.S.]] degree in [[civil engineering]]. In sports, he was captain of the [[Varsity team|varsity]] [[tennis]] [[Team|squad]]. During his first year he won the junior travel prize. Cary was a member of [[Sigma Xi]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=F.

After receiving his degree, Cary went to work in his father's plumbing construction business, H. G. Cary Co. He held a variety of engineering and accounting positions with the company during the early years of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="CHFHydra"/&gt;{{rp|3–6}}

==National Technical Laboratories==
As of May 31, 1935, Cary was hired by [[Arnold Beckman]] of [[National Technical Laboratories]] (NTL) (later Beckman Instruments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contract between Howard Cary and Arnold O. Beckman |url=https://digital.sciencehistory.org/works/fn106z00p  |website=[[Science History Institute]] |accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, Cary was the chief design engineer on Beckman's research team.&lt;ref name="hundred"&gt;{{cite book | isbn = 978-0-941901-23-9 |first1=Arnold |last1=Thackray  |first2=Minor |last2=Myers, Jr.     | year = 2000 | publisher = Chemical Heritage Foundation | location = Philadelphia, Pa. | title = Arnold O.

They presented a paper on this work in July 1941 at MIT's Summer Conference on Spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="Cary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cary|first1=H.

During [[World War II]], National Technical Laboratories worked on a number of then-secret projects, including one for the development of [[synthetic rubber]]. The Office of Rubber Reserve of the United States government contracted with NTL to produce an [[infrared]] spectrophotometer based on a single-beam design by [[Robert Brattain]] of [[Shell Development Company]]. The first Beckman IR-1 Spectrophotometer was shipped to Shell on September 18, 1942 barely six months after it was ordered. The IR-1 used a [[Littrow prism]] mounting featuring a single [[rock salt]] prism with a mirrored back, and an analog [[galvanometer]] for presenting results.&lt;ref name="Beckman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beckman|first1=A. O.|last2=Gallaway|first2=W. S.|last3=Kaye|first3=W.|last4=Ulrich|first4=W.

Cary and Beckman adapted features from the pH meter and the DU spectrophotometer to improve the design of the IR-1 spectrophotometer.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|160–169}}
By 1945, the IR-2 spectrophotometer was in production, using an electronic vacuum tube amplifier instead of a galvanometer, and a thermocouple tube for the detection of infrared light.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|160–169}}

== Cary Instruments ==
In January 1946, Cary left NTL to form his own company, [[Applied Physics Corporation]] (later known as [[Cary Instruments]]) in [[Pasadena, California]], with [[George W. Downs]], William Miller, and Russell E. Vaniman.&lt;ref name="hundred"/&gt;{{rp|160–169}} Cary and his company developed a range of scientific instruments, particularly dual-beam spectrophotometers.  The Applied Physics Corporation made its first delivery, a Cary 11 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, to [[Mellon Institute]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in April 1947. The Cary 11 was followed by the [[Cary 14 Spectrophotometer|Cary 14 UV-Vis-NIR]] in 1954, the Cary 15 UV-Vis in 1961, the Cary 16 UV-Vis in 1964, and an expanded offering of instruments through the 70s, 80s, and 90s.&lt;ref name="Varian"&gt;{{cite web|title=UV-VIS-NIR Varian  Cary 100/300/400/500 Spectrophotometers|url=http://photos.labwrench.com/equipmentManuals/1055-1029.pdf|publisher=Varian|page=4|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Downs"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Downs-Lauritsen Laboratory of Physics|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/289/01/lab.pdf|first=Howard|last= Cary|journal=Engineering and Science|volume= 33|number=4|pages= 28–29|date= 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cary 14 spectrophotometer used a double folded-z-configuration monochromator.  Appearing on the market in 1954, it was the first commercial UV-VIS-NIR instrument to fully extend into the near-infrared spectrum.&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hind|first1=Andrew R.|title=To improvements in spectrophotometry. . .|journal=American Laboratory|date=December 2002|volume=34|pages=32–35|url=http://cn.agilent.com/cs/library/whitepaper/public/uv-vis-hind-1202.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1959, Cary was the recipient of the [[American Chemical Society]] Division of Analytical Chemistry's Award in Chemical Instrumentation. Robert Brattain described Cary's approach to instrument design, when giving the award.&lt;ref name="DAC"&gt;{{cite web|title=DAC Award in Chemical Instrumentation|url=http://analyticaldivision.sites.acs.org/chemicalinstrumentation.htm|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|First, he does not necessarily start from where others have left off.  Rather, he goes back to the basic problem and gets it clearly enough in his mind that he can start his thinking and his theoretical development from a simple, logical statement of the problem.  Second, he uses his very marked ability as a theoretician; an ability well known to his close associates but probably not as well known in general as it deserves to be, to develop a logical analysis based on the simple statement of the problem and exploring various methods of solution.   Thirdly, Howard believes what a logical analysis of the problem tells him. Consequently, throughout the entire period of theoretical design, he avoids being trapped into blind acceptance of the folklore in a particular area and consequently, his designs consistently include new and original approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Brattain, April 23, 1959 "Introduction of Howard Cary as the Beckman Award Winner" (1959)   ACS Presentation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5093">The '''interferometric visibility''' (also known as '''interference visibility''' and '''fringe visibility''', or just '''visibility''' when in context) quantifies the contrast of [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] in any system which has wave-like properties, such as [[optics]], [[quantum mechanics]], water waves, or electrical signals.  Generally, two or more waves are combined and as the phase difference between them varies, the [[power (physics)|power]] or [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] (probability or population in [[quantum mechanics]]) of the resulting wave oscillates, forming an interference pattern. The pattern may be visible all at once because the phase difference varies as a function of space, as in a 2-slit experiment. Alternately, the phase difference may be manually controlled by the operator, for example by adjusting a vernier knob in an [[interferometer]]. The ratio of the size or [[amplitude]]{{clarify|reason=What is the "amplitude" of an oscillation? At the link, the first thing it says is "there are various definitions of amplitude."|date=May 2015}} of these oscillations to the sum of the powers of the individual waves is defined as the visibility.

The interferometric visibility gives a practical way to measure the [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]] of two waves (or one wave with itself). A theoretical definition of the coherence is given by the [[degree of coherence]], using the notion of correlation.

==Visibility in optics==
In linear optical [[interferometer]]s{{clarify|reason=Linear optical interferometers are not defined (under that name) in the linked article.|date=May 2015}} (like the [[Mach-Zehnder interferometer]], [[Michelson interferometer]], and [[Sagnac interferometer]]), interference manifests itself as [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillations]] over time or space, also called ''[[Interference fringe|fringes]]''. Under these circumstances, the interferometric visibility is also known as the "Michelson visibility" &lt;ref&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/FringeVisibility.html&lt;/ref&gt; or the "fringe visibility." For this type of interference, the sum of the intensities (powers) of the two interfering waves equals the average intensity over a given time or space domain. The visibility is written as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://spie.org/samples/FG30.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nu=A/\bar{I},&lt;/math&gt;

in terms of the amplitude [[envelope curve|envelope]] of the oscillating intensity and the average intensity:

:&lt;math&gt;A=(I_\max-I_\min)/2&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{I}=(I_\max+I_\min)/2&lt;/math&gt;.

So it can be rewritten as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys4510/phys4510_fa05/Chapter8.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{I_\max-I_\min}{I_\max+I_\min},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum intensity of the oscillations and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; the minimum intensity of the oscillations.  If the two optical fields are ideally [[monochromatic]] (consist of only single wavelength) point sources of the same [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], then the predicted visibility will be

:&lt;math&gt;\nu=\frac{2\sqrt{I_1 I_2}}{I_1+I_2},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; indicate the intensity of the respective wave.  Any dissimilarity between the optical fields will decrease the visibility from the ideal. In this sense, the visibility is a measure of the [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]] between two optical fields. A theoretical definition for this is given by the [[degree of coherence]].  This definition of interference directly applies to the interference of water waves and electric signals.

[[Image:visibility.png|left|thumb|Visibility in a Mach-Zehnder, Michelson or Sagnac interferometer.]]
[[Image:double slit visibility.png|thumb|Visibility is similarly defined in double-slit interference. However, now the max and min vary across the interference pattern. The example shows a visibility of 80% (i.e. 0.8).]]

{{clear}}

==Visibility in quantum mechanics==
Since the [[Schrödinger equation]] is a [[wave equation]] and all objects can be considered waves in [[quantum mechanics]], interference is ubiquitous. Some examples: [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s can exhibit interference fringes.  Atomic populations show interference in a [[Ramsey interferometer]].  Photons, atoms, electrons, neutrons, and molecules have exhibited interference in [[double-slit interferometer]]s.

'''Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Ио́сиф Самуи́лович Шкло́вский}}; sometimes transliterated ''Josif, Josif, Shklovskii, Shklovskij'') (July 1, 1916 &amp;ndash; March 3, 1985) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[astronomer]] and [[astrophysicist]]. He is remembered for work in theoretical [[astrophysics]] and other topics, as well as for his 1962 book on extraterrestrial life, the revised and expanded version of which was co-authored by American astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] in 1966 as ''Intelligent Life in the Universe''. 

He won the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1960 and the [[Bruce Medal]] in 1972. [[Asteroid]] [[2849 Shklovskij]] and the crater [[Shklovsky (crater)|Shklovsky]] (on the [[Mars|Martian]] moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]) are named in his honor. He was a Corresponding Member of [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] since 1966.

==Early life==
Shklovsky was born in [[Hlukhiv]], a city in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] part of the [[Russian Empire]], into a poor [[Ukrainian Jewish]] family. After graduating from the seven-year secondary school, he worked as a [[Construction foreman|foreman]] on building [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]. In 1933 Shklovsky entered the Physico-Mathematical Faculty of the [[Moscow State University]]. 

There he studied until 1938, when he took a Postgraduate Course at the Astrophysics Department of the [[Sternberg Astronomical Institute|Sternberg State Astronomical Institute]] and remained working in the Institute until the end of his life.  He died in Moscow, aged 68.

==Research==
He specialized in theoretical [[astrophysics]] and [[radio astronomy]], as well as the [[Sun]]'s [[corona]], [[supernova]]e, and [[cosmic ray]]s and their origins. He showed, in 1946, that the radio-wave radiation from the Sun emanates from the ionized layers of its corona, and he developed a mathematical method for discriminating between thermal and nonthermal radio waves in the [[Milky Way]]. He is noted especially for his suggestion that the radiation from the [[Crab Nebula]] is due to [[synchrotron radiation]], in which unusually energetic electrons twist through magnetic fields at speeds close to that of light. Shklovsky proposed that cosmic rays from supernova explosions within 300 light years of the sun could have been responsible for some of the mass extinctions of life on earth.

In 1959 Shklovsky examined the orbital motion of [[Mars]]'s inner satellite [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]]. He concluded that its [[orbital decay|orbit was decaying]], and noted that if this decay was attributed to friction with the Martian atmosphere, then the satellite must have an exceptionally low density. In this context he voiced a suggestion that Phobos might be hollow, and possibly of artificial origin. This interpretation has since been refuted by more detailed study, but the apparent suggestion of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] involvement caught the public imagination, though there is some disagreement as to how seriously Shklovsky intended the idea to be taken. However, Shklovsky and [[Carl Sagan]]&lt;ref&gt;Shklovski, I.S and Carl Sagan. Intelligent Life in the Universe. San Francisco: Holden-Day, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for serious consideration of "[[Ancient_astronauts#Scientific_consideration|paleocontact]]" with extraterrestrials in the early historical era, and for examination of myths and religious lore for evidence of such contact. 

His 1962 book, Вселенная, жизнь, разум (''Universe, Life, Intelligence''), was expanded upon and reissued in 1966 with American astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] as co-author under the title ''Intelligent Life in the Universe'' (1966).  This was the first comprehensive discussion of this field.  Discussing the biological as well as astronomical issues of the subject, its unique format, alternating paragraphs written by Shklovsky and Sagan, demonstrated the deep mutual regard between the two and allowed them to express their views without compromise.   

In 1967, before the discovery of [[pulsar]]s, Shklovsky examined the X-ray and optical observations of [[Scorpius X-1]] and correctly concluded that the radiation comes from an [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreting]] [[neutron star]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Shklovsky | first=I.S. | title=On the Nature of the Source of X-Ray Emission of SCO XR-1 | journal=Astrophys.

==Quotes==
In the September 1965 issue of Soviet Life,&lt;ref&gt;NSA Technical Journal, Winter 1966 - Vol. XI, No. 1: Communications with Extraterrestrial Intelligence {{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/communications_extraterrestrial_intelligence.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216004721/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/tech_journals/communications_extraterrestrial_intelligence.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; he made the following statement regarding prospects for the future of humanity:

:''Profound crises lie in wait for a developing civilization and one of them may well prove fatal. We are already familiar with several such critical (situations):''
::''(a) Self-destruction as a result of a thermonuclear catastrophe or some other discovery which may have unpredictable and uncontrollable consequences.''
::''(b) Genetic danger.''
::''(c) Overproduction of information.''
::''(d) Restricted capacity of the individual's brain which can lead to excessive specialization, with consequent dangers of degeneration.''
::''(e) A crisis precipitated by the creation of artificial intelligent beings.''

==Personal life==
His memoir, ''Five Billion Vodka Bottles to the Moon: Tales of a Soviet Scientist,'' was published posthumously in 1991 by W.W. Norton &amp; Co.

In “Five Billion Vodka Bottles to the Moon,” Shklovsky recalled his visit to [[Philip Morrison]], who in 1959 had co-authored with [[Cornell University]] colleague [[Giuseppe Cocconi]] the paper in Nature magazine which marks the beginning of the modern search for extraterrestrial life, and their discussion of such issues.  Bitter over [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-semitism]], of the five pioneer investigators of the field, Cocconi, Morrison, [[Cornell University]]'s [[Frank Drake]] (of the 1961 [[Project Ozma]] and the [[Drake equation]]), Sagan, and Shklovsky, Shklovsky was quite aware of sharing his Jewish identity with Sagan. Indeed, Sagan's Jewish heritage was also [[Ukrainian Jewish]].

He was known for his sharp wit and extreme likability.  Colleagues in the astronomy department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], remember fondly his visit there in the 1970s.  Well known for his ''Intelligent Life in the Universe'', he was asked by a graduate student if UFO sightings are as common in the Soviet Union as in the United States.  "No," he replied.  "In this area the Americans are far more advanced than us."

'''Jerzy Władysław Jurka''' (June 4, 1950 – July 19, 2014) was a [[Polish American|Polish-American]] [[computational biology|computational]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] biologist.  He served as the assistant director of research at the [[Linus Pauling Institute]] prior to founding the [[Genetic Information Research Institute]]. He collaborated with several notable scientists including [[George Irving Bell]], [[Roy John Britten|Roy Britten]], [[Temple Smith]], and [[Emile Zuckerkandl]]. His [[Erdős number]] is 3, using the path through [[Temple Smith]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos1.html The Erdős Project, "Paths to Erdős"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Dr. Jurka is best known for his work on eukaryotic [[transposable elements]] (TEs), including the discovery of the major families of [[Alu element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jurka J, Smith T|title=A fundamental division in the Alu family of repeated sequences|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=85 |issue=July|pages=279–90|date=July 1988|doi=10.1073/pnas.85.13.4775|pmc=280518}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed the mechanism of Alu proliferation and discovered their paternal transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Jurka J|title=Sequence patterns indicate an enzymatic involvement in integration of mammalian retroposons|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|volume=94|issue=5|pages=1872–1877|date=March 1997|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.5.1872|pmc=20010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jurka J, etal |title=Active Alu elements are passed primarily through paternal germlines|journal=[[Theoretical Population Biology]]|volume=61|issue=4|pages=519–530|date=June 2002|doi=10.1006/tpbi.2002.1602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of known types of class II TEs, or DNA [[transposons]], were discovered or co-discovered by his team at the [[Genetic Information Research Institute]], based on DNA sequence analysis. The first one, reported in 2001 with Vladimir Kapitonov,  became known as ''[[Helitron (biology)|Helitron]]'', which is playing a major role in genomic [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Helitrons on a roll: eukaryotic rolling-circle transposons|author1=Vladimir V.

In 2006 they reported a study of a new,  self-synthesizing [[transposable element]]  called [[Polinton]] or Maverick, which is present many diverse [[eukaryotes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vladimir V.

Jerzy Jurka is the founder of Repbase [http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html], which he developed since 1990 with his team and other contributors. Repbase is the primary reference database of TEs used in [[DNA annotation]] and analysis.

The '''Juggis''', or Jughis, are members of an ethnic group of itinerant travelers found in north-central [[Afghanistan]]. They are looked down on by other local groups, and considered "as blots on the ethnic landscape." Many Juggis can be found living in makeshift camps and tents in the outskirts of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Most Juggis claim to descend from travelers from [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Richard F. Nyrop and Donald M. Seekins

[[Edward Balfour]] noted a Muslim group known as ''Jughi'' in [[Bukhara]], that he described in 1885 as gypsy-like, in which "women go unveiled, and the men are careless in their religious duties." The group was known for practicing medicine, fortune-telling and horse-trading, and wandered between Bukhara, [[Samarkand]], and [[Qorako‘l|Karakul]].&lt;ref name="Balfour1885"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Balfour|title=The cyclopædia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia: commercial, industrial and scientific, products of the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, useful arts and manufactures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxwaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=30 March 2011|year=1885|publisher=B.

'''Karl Friedrich Mohr''' (November 4, 1806 – September 28, 1879) was a German [[chemist]] famous for his early statement of the principle of the [[conservation of energy]]. Ammonium iron(II) sulfate, (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, is named [[Mohr's salt]] after him.

==Life==

Mohr was born in 1806 into the family of a prosperous druggist in [[Koblenz]]. The young Mohr received much of his early education at home, a great part of it in his father's laboratory. This experience may be responsible for much of the skill Mohr later showed in devising instruments and methods of chemical analysis. At the age of twenty-one he began to study chemistry under [[Leopold Gmelin]], and, after five years in [[Heidelberg]], Berlin and [[Bonn]], he returned with the degree of PhD to join his father's establishment.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Mohr's father died during 1840 at which time Mohr assumed control of the family business. He retired from it for a life of scientific leisure in 1857, but at the age of fifty-seven some serious financial losses caused him to become a [[privatdozent]] in Bonn. In 1867 he was appointed, by the direct influence of the government, extraordinary professor of [[pharmacy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Work==

[[Image:Mohr burette.jpg|thumb|200px|Mohr burette]]Mohr was the leading scientific chemist of his time in Germany, and the inventor of many improvements in analytical methodology. He invented an improved [[burette]] which had a tip at the bottom and a clamp (a 'Mohr's clip'), which made it much easier to use than its predecessors, which were more similar to a graduated cylinder. His methods of [[volumetric analysis]] were expounded in his ''Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrir-methode'' (1855) (Instructional Book of Titration Methods in Analytical Chemistry), which won special commendation from [[Liebig]] and ran to many editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohr|first1=Karl Friedrich|title=Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrirmethode … , part 1|date=1855|publisher=Friederich Vieweg und Sohn|location=Braunschweig, (Germany)|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89087461158;view=1up;seq=7|trans-title=Textbook of analytical chemistry titration methods … |language=German}}  Page 3 shows Mohr's burette.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Geschichte der Erde, eine Geologie auf neuer Grundlage'' (1866) (History of the Earth, a Geology on a New Basis), was also widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mohr|first1=Friedrich|title=Geschichte der Erde.

In a paper ''Über die Natur der Wärme'' (1837), Mohr gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the [[conservation of energy]]:&lt;ref&gt;Über die Natur der Wärme, Zeitschrift für Physik und verwandte Wissenschaften (Wien, 1937), Volume 5, pg 442.

{{quote|besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called Kraft (energy). It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} }}

{{Culture of Korea}}
'''Korean folklore''' is well established, going back several thousand years. The folklore's basis derives from a variety of belief systems, including Shamanism, Confucianism, Buddhism and more recently Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://koreanhistoricaldramas.com/korean-folklore-goblins-and-other-beings/|title=Korean Folklore – Goblins and Other Beings|date=2016-12-16|work=Sageuk: Korean Historical Dramas|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mythical creatures often abound in the tales, including the Korean conception of goblins.

== Types of Folklore ==
There are many types of folklore in Korean culture, including [[Imuldan]] (이물담), focused on supernatural beings such as monsters, goblins and ghosts. The most common of which are the [[Dokkaebi]] (도깨비), meaning goblin. However, this term differs from the European concept of 'goblin' in that they do not possess a evil or demonic characteristic. Instead, they are creatures with powers that seek to both bring delight to people and misery. These beings engage either in friendly or annoying behavior with humans. Their interactions with humans represent the belief in the supernatural and their interactions with humanity. The presence of these beings is meant to represent both difficulties and pleasures in life.[http://koreanhistoricaldramas.com/korean-folklore-goblins-and-other-beings/]

== Contemporary Revival ==
A revival on internet sites occurred recently, providing inspiration for artists and illustrators.

Recent achievements in keeping Korean folklore alive include the 150-part animated TV series, "[[Animentary Korean Folklore]]", telling old tales with a traditional 2-D Korean styled animation.

In [[microeconomics]], the '''law of demand''' states that, "conditional on [[ceteris paribus|all else being equal]], as the price of a [[Goods|good]] increases '''(↑)''', quantity demanded decreases '''(↓)'''; conversely, as the price of a good decreases '''(↓)''', quantity demanded increases '''(↑)'''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extensions|last=Nicholson|first=Walter|last2=Snyder|first2=Christopher|publisher=South-Western|year=2012|isbn=978-111-1-52553-8|edition=11|location=Mason, OH|pages=27,154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the law of demand describes an [[negative relationship|inverse relationship]] between price and quantity demanded of a good. Alternatively, other things being constant, quantity demanded of a commodity is inversely related to the price of the commodity. For example, a consumer may demand 2 kilograms of apples at Rs 70 per kg; he may, however, demand 1{{nbsp}}kg if the price rises to Rs 80 per kg. This has been the general human behaviour on relationship between the price of the commodity and the quantity demanded. The factors held constant refer to other determinants of demand, such as the prices of other goods and the consumer's income.&lt;ref&gt;''http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdemand.asp''; Investopedia, Retrieved 9 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, some possible exceptions to the law of demand, such as [[Giffen goods]] and [[Veblen goods]].

== Mathematical expression ==
Mathematically, the inverse relationship described by the law of demand may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;Q_x = f(P_x ; \mathbf Y), \quad \partial f / \partial P_x &lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;Q_x&lt;/math&gt; is the quantity demanded of good ''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'',  &lt;math&gt;P_x&lt;/math&gt; is the price of the good, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[demand function]], &lt;math&gt;\partial f / \partial P_x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partial derivative]] of the demand function with respect to &lt;math&gt;P_x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf Y&lt;/math&gt; is the list of other parameters held constant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The above equation, when plotted with quantity demanded (&lt;math&gt;Q_x&lt;/math&gt;) on the ''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;''-axis and price (&lt;math&gt;P_x&lt;/math&gt;) on the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-axis, gives the [[demand curve]], which is also known as the demand schedule. The downward sloping nature of a typical demand curve illustrates the inverse relationship between quantity demanded and price. Therefore, a downward sloping demand curve embeds the law of demand.

== Terminology ==
{{Further information|Demand}}
[[File:Increase DDcurve.png|thumb|An increase in demand is depicted by a rightward shift in the demand curve, from DD0 to DD1. At first, a consumer is willing to consume Q0 units of goods at the price P0, shown by Point A. After their demand for the good increases, for the same quantity demanded Q0, they are now willing to pay at price P1, shown by Point B. For the original price P0, they are now willing consume Q1 units, shown by Point C.]]
Note that "demand" and "quantity demanded" are used to mean different things in economic jargon. On the one hand, "demand" refers to the entire demand curve, which is the relationship between quantity demanded and price. Changes in demand are due to changes in other determinants (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Y&lt;/math&gt;), such as the income of consumers. Therefore, "change in demand" is used to mean that the relationship between quantity demanded and price has changed. Alfred Marshall worded this as: &lt;blockquote&gt;When then we say that a person's demand for anything increases, we mean that he will buy more of it than he would before at the same price, and that he will buy as much of it as before at a higher price.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Changes in demand is depicted graphically by a shift in the demand curve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the other hand, "quantity demanded" refers to the quantity of goods consumers want for a given price, conditional on the other determinants. "Changes in quantity demanded" is depicted graphically by a movement along the demand curve.

== Economic history and theory ==
The law of demand was documented as early as 1892 by economist [[Alfred Marshall]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elements of economics of industry|last=Marshall Abhishek|first=Alfred|publisher=Macmillan|year=1892|isbn=|location=London|pages=77,79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the law's general agreement with observation, economists have come to accept the validity of the law under most situations. Furthermore, researchers found that the success of the law of demand extends to animals such as rats, under laboratory settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thaler|first=Richard|title=Toward a positive theory of consumer choice|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-2681(80)90051-7|journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=39–60|doi=10.1016/0167-2681(80)90051-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kagel|first=John H.|last2=Battalio|first2=Raymond C.|last3=Rachlin|first3=Howard|last4=Green|first4=Leonard|last5=Basmann|first5=Robert L.|last6=Klemm|first6=W.

== Exceptions to the law of demand ==
Generally the amount demanded of a good increases with a decrease in price of the good and vice versa.  In some cases, however, this may not be true. There are certain goods which do not follow this law. These include [[Veblen goods] [Giffen goods] and expectations of future price changes. Further exception and details are given in the sections below.

== Giffen goods ==
Initially proposed by  [Sir Robert Giffen], economists disagree on the existence of [[Giffen good]]s in the market. A Giffen good describes an inferior good that as the price increases, demand for the product increases. As an example, during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] of the 19th century, potatoes were considered a Giffen good. Potatoes were the largest staple in the Irish diet, so as the price rose it had a large impact on income. People responded by cutting out on [[luxury good]]s such as meat and vegetables, and instead bought more potatoes. Therefore, as the price of potatoes increased, so did the quantity demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mankiw|first=Gregory|title=Principles of Economics|year=2007|publisher=South-Western Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-324-22472-6|pages=470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expectation of change in the price of commodity ===
If an increase in the price of a commodity causes households to expect the price of a commodity to increase further, they may start purchasing a greater amount of the commodity even at the presently increased price.  Similarly, if the household expects the price of the commodity to decrease, it may postpone its purchases. Thus, some argue that the law of demand is violated in such cases. In this case, the demand curve does not slope down from left to right; instead it presents a backward slope from the top right to down left. This curve is known as an exceptional demand curve.prestigious goods also fail law of demand

=== Basic or necessary goods ===
The goods which people need no matter how high the price is are basic or necessary goods. Medicines covered by insurance are a good example. An increase or decrease in the price of such a good does not affect its quantity demanded. These goods have a perfectly inelastic relationship, in that any change in price does not change the quantity demanded.

'''''Megawatts and Megatons''''' is a 2001 book by [[Richard L. Garwin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/authors/3229 Richard L. Garwin]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georges Charpak]]. The book is said to be a good primer on [[nuclear power]] and also a detailed discussion of [[nuclear weapons]] and potential paths for weapons reduction.&lt;ref name=am&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/nuclear-complexities Nuclear Complexities]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ran&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/garwin/ Megawatts and Megatons]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The book presents detailed information about [[nuclear reactors]] and provides useful information on nuclear power program development in the United States and France.  A discussion on nuclear weapons and non-proliferation follows.&lt;ref name=am/&gt;&lt;ref name=ran/&gt;

{{GeoGroup|article=Operation Anvil (Nuclear test)}}

'''Operation Anvil'''&lt;ref name=LT_1 /&gt; was a series of 21 [[nuclear test]]s conducted by the United States in 1975-1976 at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. These tests followed the ''[[Operation Bedrock]]'' series and preceded the ''[[Operation Fulcrum]]'' series.

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name &lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | [[List of nuclear test sites|Location]] &lt;ref group=note&gt;Rough place name and a latitude/longitude reference; for rocket-carried tests, the launch location is specified before the detonation location, if known. Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height &lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery &lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose &lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oscar Buneman''' (28 September 1913 – 24 January 1993) made advances in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]]. Buneman was a pioneer of computational [[plasma physics]] and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] simulation.&lt;ref name="tribute"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buneman | first1 = R. | last2 = Barker | first2 = R.

==Career==
In 1940 upon completion of his PhD with [[Douglas Hartree]],&lt;ref name="mathgene"/&gt; Buneman joined Hartree's magnetron research group assisting the development of radar during World War II. They discovered the Buneman–Hartree criterion for the voltage threshold of a magnetron operation. After the war, Buneman developed theories and simulations of collision-less dissipation of currents&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buneman | first1 = O. | title = Dissipation of Currents in Ionized Media | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.115.503 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 115 | issue = 3 | pages = 503 | year = 1959 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; called the Buneman instability. This is an example of [[:wikt:anomaly|anomalous]] [[resistivity]] or absorption.  It is ''anomalous'' because the phenomenon does not depend on collisions.  Buneman advanced [[elliptic equation]] solver methods and their associated applications (as well as for the [[fast Fourier transform]]s).

==Personal life==
On January 24, 1993, Oscar Buneman at the age of 79 died near [[Stanford University]]. The [[computer scientist]] [[Peter Buneman]] is his son.

[[File:Academic disciplines (collage).jpg|thumb|Collage of images representing different academic disciplines]]

An '''academic discipline''' or '''field of study''' is a branch of [[knowledge]], [[education|taught]] and [[research]]ed as part of [[higher education]]. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined by the [[faculty (division)|university faculties]] and [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs and the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes [[research]].

Disciplines vary between well-established ones that exist in almost all universities and have well-defined rosters of [[Academic journal|journal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and conferences and nascent ones supported by only a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, and these are often called sub-disciplines.

There is no [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] on how some academic disciplines should be classified, for example whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of the [[social science]]s or of the [[humanities]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to academic disciplines.

An important field of research today is trying to improve, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the capacity to measure phenomes. This includes developing high-throughput measurement systems.

For example, the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility, an initiative of the Australian government, has developed a number of new instruments for comprehensive and fast measurements of phenotypes in both the lab and the field.

[[File:Aubade à l'occasion du mariage de la princesse Stéphanie avec l'archiduc Rodolphe d'Autriche le 20 mai 1880.jpg|thumb|The engagement of [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Rudolf of Austria]] and [[Princess Stéphanie of Belgium]] in the Winter Garden.]]The '''Royal Greenhouses of Laeken''' ({{lang-nl|Koninklijke Serres van Laken}}, {{lang-fr|Serres Royales de Laeken}}) are a vast complex of monumental heated [[greenhouse]]s in the park of the [[Royal Castle of Laeken]] in the north of [[Brussels]]. The historic complex contains tropical, sub tropical and cold greenhouses.&lt;ref&gt;De tuinman &amp; de koning: Het domein van Laken &amp; zijn bewoners Boek van Erlend Hamerlijnck en Paul Van Gorp&lt;/ref&gt; These greenhouses are world famous, but not a tourist attraction. The greenhouses are part of the Royal Park, and the royal private gardens and usually not open for visitors.

== History ==
The gardens date back to the 18th century, but [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] changed its garden-architecture. A brand new complex was commissioned by King Leopold II and designed by [[Alphonse Balat]]. Built between 1874 and 1895, the complex was finished with the completion of the so-called ''Iron Church'', a domed greenhouse, which would originally serve as the [[royal chapel]]. The total floor surface of this immense complex is 2.5 hectares (270,000 square feet). 800,000 liters (over 200,000 US gallons) of fuel oil are needed each year to heat the buildings.
After the death of the king, the greenhouses were kept, but the ''Iron Church'' was converted into a private royal bathing house.

=== Royal botanic collection ===
Famous is the royal botanic collection, with old plants from [[Africa]] and various species of flowers which are cultivated inside the royal greenhouses for use at [[court]].
Though the current collection has lost many [[Cultivar|cultivars]] since the death of King Leopold II, the collection is still famous.&lt;ref&gt;De tuinman &amp; de koning: Het domein van Laken &amp; zijn bewoners Boek van Erlend Hamerlijnck en Paul Van Gorp&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, there were 314 species of [[Camellia|camellias]] in the royal collection, with more than 1000 plants. Today, only 305 remain. The camellias are the world's largest and oldest collection in a greenhouse.
The [[Orange tree]] collection of Leopold II was renowned with 130 trees aged 200 to 300 years; one even 400 years. In the 1970s, only 45 trees were still alive.&lt;ref&gt;De tuinman &amp; de koning: Het domein van Laken &amp; zijn bewoners Boek van Erlend Hamerlijnck en Paul Van Gorp&lt;/ref&gt;
== Visit ==
The royal complex can only be visited each year during a two-week period in April–May, when most flowers are in full bloom. Other times, the greenhouses are visited by heads of state during official visits.

== Famous visitors ==
* [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Archduke Rudolf]] was engaged in the new Winter Garden.
* [[Laura Bush]] (2001)
* [[Melania Trump]] (2017)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2760">'''Secondary research''' involves the summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing research. Secondary research is contrasted with primary research in that primary research involves the generation of data, whereas secondary research uses primary research sources as a source of data for analysis.&lt;ref name=ithaca&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary and Secondary Sources|url=https://library.ithaca.edu/sp/subjects/primary|website=library.ithaca.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable marker of primary research is the inclusion of a "methods" section, where the authors describe how the data was generated.

Common examples of secondary research include [[textbooks]], [[encyclopedia]]s, [[news]] articles, [[review articles]], and [[meta analysis|meta analyses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ormsby|first1=Tim|title=Search Smart: Types of Research: Secondary Research|url=http://flinders.libguides.com/researchtypes/secondary|website=flinders.libguides.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Camille|title=LibGuides: Scholarly Literature Types: Primary vs. Secondary Articles|url=http://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=293669&amp;p=2004549|website=guides.library.cornell.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When conducting secondary research, authors may draw data from published academic papers, government documents, statistical databases, and historical records.&lt;ref name=ithaca/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bosch|first1=Eileen|title=LibGuides: Library Basics: Primary and Secondary Sources|url=http://libguides.bgsu.edu/c.php?g=227153&amp;p=1505675|website=libguides.bgsu.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields ==
The term is widely used in [[health research]], [[legal research]] and [[market research]]. The principal methodology in health secondary research is the [[systematic review]], commonly using meta-analytic statistical techniques, but other methods of synthesis, like realist reviews and meta-narrative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9780727918697 Diffusion of Innovations in Health Service Organisations: a systematic literature review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202203417/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=9780727918697 |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviews, have been developed in recent years. Such secondary research uses the primary research of others typically in the form of research publications and reports.

In a market research context, secondary research is taken to include the reuse, by a second party, of any data collected by a first party, such as telephone interviews or surveys.

'''Spatial Intelligence''' is an area in the [[theory of multiple intelligences]] that deals with spatial judgment and the ability to visualize with the mind's eye. It is defined by [[Howard Gardner]] as a human computational capacity that provides the ability or mental skill to solve spatial problems of [[navigation]], visualization of objects from different angles and [[space]], faces or scenes recognition, or to notice fine details. Gardner further explains that Spatial Intelligence could be more effective to solve problems in areas related to realistic, thing-oriented,  and investigative occupations. This capability is a brain skill that is also found in people with visual impairment. As researched by Gardner, a blind person can recognize shapes in a non-visual way. The spatial reasoning of the blind person allows them to translate tactile sensations into mental calculations of length and visualizations of form.

[[Theory of multiple intelligences|Spatial intelligence]] is one of the nine intelligences on Howard Gardner’s [[Theory of multiple intelligences|Theory of Multiple Intelligences]], each of which is composed of a number of separate sub capacities. An intelligence provides the ability to solve problems or create products that are valued in a particular culture. Each intelligence is a neurally based computational system that is activated by internal or external information. [[Intelligences]] are always an interaction between biological proclivities and the opportunities for learning that exist in a culture. The application of this theory in the general practice covers a product range from scientific theories to musical compositions to successful political campaigns.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;[[Howard Gardner|Gardner Howard]] (2006). ''Multiple Intelligences: New Horizons.'' p 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner suggested a general correspondence between each capability with an occupational role in the workplace, for examples: for those individuals with [[Theory of multiple intelligences|linguistic]] intelligence he pointed journalists, speakers and trainers; scientists, engineers, financiers and accountants on [[Theory of multiple intelligences|logical-mathematical]] intelligence; sales people, managers, teachers and counselors on the [[Theory of multiple intelligences|personal]] intelligence; athletes, contractors and actors on [[Theory of multiple intelligences|bodily-kinesthetic]] intelligence; taxonomists, ecologists and veterinarians on [[Theory of multiple intelligences|naturalistic]] intelligence; clergy and philosophers on [[Theory of multiple intelligences|existential]] intelligence and designers, architects and taxi drivers, astronauts, airplane pilots and race car drivers and stunt men on [[Theory of multiple intelligences|spatial]] intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

==Different approaches==

===Newcombe and Frick===
In the article, Early Education for spatial intelligence: Why, What and How, [[Nora Newcombe]] and Andrea Frick apply the concept of spatial intelligence to the educational realm. Newcombe and Frick approached the concept in different ways:&lt;ref&gt;Integrating spatial contact into formal and informal instruction could improve spatial functioning in general.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spatial intelligence has evolutionary and adaptive importance. Any mobile organism must be able to navigate in its world to survive and must represent the spatial environment in order to do so. Moving further along the evolutionary timeline, the human ability to make tools is one of the hallmarks of our species.&lt;ref name= "nora"&gt;Newcombe Nora S and Andrea Frick (2010). ''Early Education for Spatial Intelligence: Why, What, and How.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*Spatial thinking is the principal complement to verbal thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Newcombe and Frick suggested various researches within general intelligence in adults by Carroll, J. B. (1993). Human cognitive abilities: A survey of factor-analytic studies. New York: Cambridge University Press.
Spatial numeracy factor in preschoolers (by Bornstein, M. H. (2009). The mind of the preschool child: The intelligence-school interface. In O. A. Barbarin &amp; B. H. Wasik (Eds.), Handbook of early child development and early education: Research to practice (pp. 123–142). New York: Guilford) as well as in chimpanzees (by Herrmann, E., Herna ́ndez-Lloreda, M. V., Call, J., Hare, B., &amp; Tomasello, M. (2010). The structure of individual differences in the cognitive abilities of children and chimpanzees. Psychological Science, 21, 102–110.)
Spatial intelligence was one of the types of intelligence proposed in multiple-intelligence theory by Gardner, H. (1983). Frames of mind: The theory of multiple intelligences. New York: Basic Books.
Approaches to working memory have distinguished between verbal working memory and the visu-ospatial sketchpad by Baddeley, A. (1986). Working memory. New York: Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Spatial thinking aids reasoning in domains that are not, on the surface, obviously spatial. For example, spatial metaphors and diagrams can be used to understand ordered relations (e.g., the ranking of Gross National Product among developing countries) or complex hierarchical relations (e.g., social relationships and biological taxonomies).
*A critically important application of spatial thinking is to the [[STEM fields|science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) disciplines. For example, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]’s discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] occurred when they were able to fit a three-dimensional model to [[Rosalind Franklin]]’s flat images of the [[molecule]]—clearly a spatial task. Similarly, a geoscientist visualizes the processes that affect the formation of the earth, an engineer anticipates how various forces may affect the design of a structure, and a neurosurgeon visualizes particular brain areas from magnetic resonance imaging that may determine the outcome of a surgical procedure.
*Spatial intelligence provides the ability to imagine transformations of the orientation of objects (e.g., mental rotations) and the ability to imagine the consequence of observer movements around arrays of objects (i.e., perspective taking). Mental rotation is the skill for which the strongest evidence exists currently for positing relations with STEM learning, and both mental rotation and perspective taking have been extensively studied from a variety of approaches, including research that has adopted developmental, cognitive, psychometric, and neuroscientific methods.&lt;ref name= "nora" /&gt;

===Ness, Farenga, &amp; Garofalo===
Daniel Ness, Stephen Farenga, and Salvatore Garofalo argue that along with verbal intelligence and logico-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence is one of three cognitive domains on which individuals are assessed at some point in their lives. Unlike verbal and logico-mathematical intelligence, however, spatial intelligence is often not assessed on most standardized tests and secondary-level or tertiary-level entrance examinations. Its lack of inclusion on these assessments is problematic because success on questions based on verbal intelligence and logico-mathematical intelligence may fail to tap populations skilled in spatial relations and orientations. Ness, Farenga, and Garofalo also posit that experiences with certain physical objects allow for greater dividends in spatial intelligence. To this end, objects with greater affordance, such as certain LEGO bricks, may impede spatial intelligence while objects with limited affordance, such as cuboidal blocks (i.e., planks) provide for increased spatial intelligence.

===Van Schaik===
The architect Leon van Schaik formulates the adoption of spatial intelligence in the field of [[architecture]] and [[design]]. His first assumption relates to the origin of architecture in the human computational capacity to organize themselves spatially; based on people's own ideas about space, histories in space and communal mental space; all have been a combination that has evolved into society over millennia.&lt;ref name= "Leon"&gt;Van Schaik Leon (2008). ''Spatial Intelligence: New Futures For Architecture.'' John Wiley &amp; Son Inc Great Britain. {{ISBN|978-0-470-72322-7}} (hb) 978-0470-72323-4 (pb)&lt;/ref&gt; Van Schaik explains how spatial intelligence works and how it is linked to the way individuals assess their surroundings. His comments are based on the research done by [[Roger Penrose]], [[Shadows of the Mind]].&lt;ref&gt;Penrose Roger (1994). ''Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness''. Oxford University Press. United States of America.&lt;/ref&gt; The awareness of what happens around someone comes from cells in the human body with enormous calculating capabilities, "intelligence is a distributed system: not something held like a command centre in the brain and then distributed, but something that is present throughout the organism, and linked together through the nervous system".&lt;ref name= "Leon" /&gt; An example to explain this human capability is similar to the ways spatial intelligence works in kinetic environments. Like the ability in which football players compute and execute the exact angle and force required to score a goal from a free kick. Another example of distributed intelligence at work is in the [[Indigenous Australian art|Australian Aboriginal Art]]. Aboriginal dot painting is a representation of the landscape inhabited by them with a surprising resemblance to the real space. It shows watercourses, animal shelter, where the edible plant are and all dimensions and spatial arrangement has been learned through a constant exposure to the world surrounding them, by walking, hunting, stalking, spearing.&lt;ref name="Leon"/&gt;
Van Schaik argues about the influence of spatial intelligence in the creation of engaging spaces. His assumption is to create a better relation between internal and external environments, and it requires the use of the best available knowledge, which in his opinion, involves the designer’s spatial intelligence and mental space; the new informational environment that enables the professional designer to communicate more interactively and inclusively.&lt;ref name= "Leon" /&gt; In van Schaik point of view, this new process of understanding space will provide the chance to forge new kinds of unity between architecture and the communities it seeks to serve: the commission of spatial intelligence is leading architecture’s domain into a new discipline that venture into new spatial formulations, new roles and new approaches. Van Schaik also pointed that architecture has to be more than the production of branded consumable, it has to be capable to influence the individuals deeper history, a benign and malevolent influence in people’s lives. For van Schaik, some of the most influencing architects using spatial intelligence in combination of their community’s mental space are: [[Peter Zumthor]], [[Sean Godsell]], [[Herzog and de Meuron]], [[Zaha Hadid]] and [http://www.ushida-findlay.com/ Kathryn Findlay.]&lt;ref name = Leon /&gt;

===Komninos===
Nicos Komninos applies the concept of spatial intelligence to cities, and defined the idea as the ability of a community to use its intellectual capital, institutions and material infrastructure to deal with a range of problems and challenges. Spatial intelligence emerges from the agglomeration and integration of three types of intelligence: the inventiveness, creativity and intellectual capital of the city's population; the collective intelligence of the city's institutions and social capital; and the artificial intelligence of public and citywide smart infrastructure, virtual environments and intelligent agents. Using this spatially combined intellectual capacity, cities can respond effectively to changing socio-economic conditions, address challenges, plan their future, and sustain the prosperity and well-being of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Komninos Nicos (2008). ‘’Intelligent Cities and Globalisation of Innovation Networks.’’ Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bethune===
Brian Bethune defines spatial intelligence as the ability to grasp a changing whole and anticipate its next stage; the ability to make quick decisions; to size up all the relationships in a fast-changing array and understand them. A related notion is that of situational awareness: a heightened consciousness of the individual’s surroundings and both the intentions of the people around and their anticipated actions. Bethune claims that the power of spatial intelligence and situational awareness are fully explained in the practice of hockey. Bethune explains that hockey reveals and rewards situational and spatial intelligence like no other sport. Bethune’s example refers to the ability of the hockey player [[Wayne Gretzky]] as a gift of spatial and situational intelligence: knowing what is going to happen in three seconds, anticipating the pattern approaching by seeing the pattern instantaneously, sussing out the goalie's next decision and other players' eventual trajectories in what would be a single glance if a glance were even taken. “Gretzky is the extreme expression of the common skill the game demands”.&lt;ref&gt;Bethurne Brian (2011) ‘’Why hockey is the smartest game in the world’’ .Journal of Aesthetic Education. Toronto: Oct, 3 2011 Vol. 124, Iss. 38; pg. 46, 1 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rendell and Rawes===
[http://www.janerendell.co.uk/ Jane Rendell] and Peg Rawes research on Spatial Imagination in Design demonstrates that an individual’s sensory and perceptual engagement with an environment or space is, in part, constructed by their powers of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;This spatial imagination works within spatial intelligence and is understood as part of the design process.&lt;/ref&gt; For Rendell and Rawes spatial imagination works in a specific political and cultural imagination as belonging to the individual designer and user. The results of this contextual understanding will inform and reflect the specific cultural, historical and political diversity and value of the architectural and built environment to the design community and beyond.&lt;ref = name "inns"&gt;Inns Tom (2007).

In [[theoretical computer science]], in particular in the theory of [[formal language]]s, '''useless rules''' of a [[formal grammar]] are those [[Rules of language|rules]] of symbol production that are unreachable or unproductive, that is, that can or need never be applied.

==Definition==
Given a [[context-free grammar]], a [[nonterminal]] symbol ''X'' is called '''productive''', or '''generating''', if there is a [[formal grammar#The semantics of grammars|derivation]] ''X'' [[formal grammar#The semantics of grammars|⇒&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]] ''w'' for some string ''w'' of terminal symbols. A nonterminal symbol ''X'' is called '''reachable''' if there is a derivation ''S'' ⇒&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; α''X''β for some strings α, β of non-terminal and terminal symbols, and where ''S'' denotes the grammar's [[start symbol (formal languages)|start symbol]].

A rule with an unproductive or unreachable symbol on its left-hand side can be deleted from the grammar without changing the accepted (a.k.a. generated) language.
Likewise, an alternative containing such a symbol can be deleted from the right-hand side of a rule without changing the language.
Such rules and alternatives are called '''useless'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John E. Hopcroft |author2=Rajeev Motwani |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=2003| publisher=Addison Wesley}}; here: Sect.7.1.1, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

For formal grammars that are [[Chomsky hierarchy|not context-free]], similar definitions apply.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Examples==

Denoting nonterminal and terminal symbols by upper- and lower-case letters, respectively,
in the following [[regular grammar]] with start symbol ''S''
{|
|-
| | ''S'' → ''Bb'' | ''Cc'' | ''Ee''
|-
| | ''B'' → ''Bb'' | ''b''
|-
| | ''C'' → ''Cc'' | ''c''
|-
| | ''D'' → ''Bd'' | ''Cd'' | ''d''
|-
| | ''E'' → ''Ee''
|}

the nonterminal ''D'' is unreachable, and ''E'' is unproductive.
Hence, omitting the last two rules doesn't change the language accepted by the grammar, nor does omitting the alternative "| ''Ee''" from the right-hand side of the rule for ''S''.

==Cleaning Useless Rules==
Hopcroft, et al.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 7.2, Sect.7.1, p.255ff&lt;/ref&gt; give an algorithm to eliminate useless rules from a [[context-free grammar]].
