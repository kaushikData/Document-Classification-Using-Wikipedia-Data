'''''Acousto-electronics''''' (also spelled 'Acoustoelectronics') is a branch of [[physics]], [[acoustics]] and [[electronics]] that studies interactions of ultrasonic and hypersonic waves in solids with electrons and with electro-magnetic fields. Typical phenomena studied in acousto-electronics are [[acousto-electric effect]] and also amplification of acoustic waves by flows of electrons in piezoelectric semiconductors, when the drift velocity of the electrons exceeds the velocity of sound. The term 'acousto-electronics' is often understood in a wider sense to include numerous practical applications of the interactions of electro-magnetic fields with acoustic waves in solids. In particular, these are signal processing devices using [[surface acoustic wave]]s (SAW), different sensors of temperature, pressure, humidity, acceleration, etc.

[[File:Stamps of Romania, 2011-92.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''Anastase Dragomir''' (1896–1966) was a distinguished Romanian inventor, most famous for his "catapultable cockpit" patent (with Tănase Dobrescu) as an early form of [[ejection seat]], although preceded by [[Everard Calthrop]]'s 1916 compressed air ejection seat, and others.

Anastase Dragomir, born 6 February 1896 in [[Brăila]], [[Romania]], was the sixth child of his family. He worked in France at several aircraft factories where he perfected a system to save pilots and passengers in case of accidents. On 3 November 1928 he applied for French patent #678566, "Nouveau système de montage des parachutes dans les appareils de locomotion aérienne". Issued on 2 April 1930, the invention was, "a new system of parachuting from the apparatus for air locomotion, each passenger having his own parachute that allows, in critical moments, the assembly detaching from the plane, so the parachute with seated passenger passes through an opening."

After several attempts, Dragomir managed to obtain financing and began construction of his "catapulted cockpit". The invention was tested in a [[Farman]] airplane piloted by [[:fr:Lucien Bossoutrot|Lucien Bossoutrot]] at [[Paris-Orly]], [[France]] airport on 28 August 1929. French newspapers later reported on the invention's success. Dragomir returned home to Romania after the Paris-Orly experiment where, with Romanian aviation engineer captain Constantin Nicolau, he successfully repeated the experiment in an [[Avia]] airplane at [[Băneasa Airport]] in [[Bucharest]], Romania on 26 October 1929. He continued to refine his invention and obtained Romanian patent #40658 in 1950 for his "parachuted cell". In 1960, he received Romanian patent #41424 for a transport aircraft equipped with ejection cabins. Anastase Dragomir died in Bucharest, Romania in June 1966.

The photograph shown on the stamp is of a British-designed and built Martin-Baker ejection seat. Founded by Sir James Martin, Martin-Baker ejection seats are used by more than 80 air forces around the world today with over 16,500 seats currently in service. The Martin-Baker Aircraft Company is still run by the Martin family today.

An '''automatic trip''' is an action performed by some system, usually a [[Safety Instrumented System]], [[Programmable Logic Controller]], or [[Distributed Control System]], to put an industrial process into a safe state.  It is triggered by some parameter going into a pre-determined unsafe state.  It is usually preceded by an [[alarm]] to give a process operator a chance to correct the condition to prevent the trip, since trips are usually costly because of lost production.

A '''bahut''' is a portable [[chest (furniture)|chest]], with a rounded lid covered in leather, garnished with nails, once used for the transport of clothes or other personal luggage, it was, in short, the original [[wikt:portmanteau|portmanteau]]. This ancient receptacle, of which mention is made as early as the 14th century — its traditional form is still preserved in many varieties of the travelling trunk — sometimes had its leather covering richly ornamented, and occasionally its interior was divided into compartments; but whatever the details of its construction it was always readily portable.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bahut|volume=3|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 17th century the name fell into disuse, and was replaced by ''coffer'', which probably accounts for its misuse by the French romantic writers of the early 19th century. They applied it to almost any antique [[sideboard]], [[cupboard]] or [[wardrobe]], and its use became hopelessly confused.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In architecture, this term is also used for a dwarf-wall of plain masonry, carrying the roof of a cathedral or church and masked or hidden behind the balustrade.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary (3rd edition revised) "bahut" also means "a dress for masquerading".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary|title=Bahut| dictionary=[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]] |edition= 3rd revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3005">A '''bass worm''' is an artificial [[fishing lure]] which comes in a variety of different colors and body types and is usually scented with a salty, garlic residue.&lt;ref name="Plastic Worm"/&gt;  Bass worms are more effective than other rubber worms primarily because [[bass (fish)|bass]] are attracted to a particular worm depending on the environment in which they are being used.

==Grub Worm==
The grub is meant to resemble that of the [[larva]]e that appear naturally all around the world.  Most artificial grubs have a curly tail on the end of a fat body that flaps rapidly when being pulled through the water.  This action mimics the true movement of a living worm and helps to entice a bass to strike.  These worms vary anywhere from 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;inches in length.&lt;ref name="101 Tips"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M7ctAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=bass%20worms%20-wikipedia%20lures&amp;pg=PT278#v=snippet&amp;q=lure&amp;f=false 101 bass-catching secrets] Martin, R. 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Ringworm==
The ringworm has somewhat of a [[Earthworm|nightcrawler]] profile, equipped with a smooth, aerodynamic nose and a body that has circular ridges (or rings) that continue down the body until reaching a flat or sometimes curly tail.  These worms are typically 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;inches in length.

==Jerkbait==
A jerkbait resembles a small bait fish (example: shad); usually hard-bodied, sometimes soft plastic, usually with two (or sometimes three) treble hooks. The fisherman imparts a stop-and-go, twitching-type motion to the lure to resemble an injured or dying bait fish.

==Ribbontail Worms==
These worms tend to range between 7 and 10&amp;nbsp;inches in length; the majority of which is the tail that is sinuously twisted so it can displace water while causing as much visual pleasure to the bass as possible.  The front of the body accounts for about 3&amp;nbsp;inches of the overall length and is cylindrical in shape, sometimes having circular rings.&lt;ref name="Plastic Worm"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uUIr8EhhEMcC&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=bass%20worms%20-wikipedia%20lures%20ringworm&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q=jerkbait&amp;f=false Bass Fishing USA] Field &amp; Stream. June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Floating Worms==
Floating worms have the nightcrawler profile but instead of staying submerged, these baits hover near the surface.  These worms work well for fishing through heavy cover and over grass beds where topwater action is essential.  These worms tend to be 6 to 8&amp;nbsp;inches in length.&lt;ref name="101 Tips"/&gt;

==Colors==
Chartreuse - a tint consisting of, but not limited to, pale green and yellow.  This color is widely used in the sport of bass fishing because of its versatility when adding other colors to the lure.&lt;ref name="Plastic Worm"/&gt;

Watermelon- a light green tint that is also very versatile when adding other colors.  Watermelon lures usually come either with or without the "seed."  The watermelon seed lures will be speckled with black dots.

In raster scan equipment, an image is built up by scanning an electron beam from left to right across a [[cathode ray tube|screen]] to produce a visible trace of one scan line, reducing the brightness of the beam to zero (''horizontal blanking''), moving it back as fast as possible to the left of the screen at a slightly lower position (the next scan line), restoring the brightness, and continuing until all the lines have been displayed and the beam is at the bottom right of the screen. Its intensity is then reduced to zero again (vertical blanking), and it is rapidly moved to the top left to start again, creating the next Film frame.

In television, in particular, the vertical blanking interval is long to accommodate the slow equipment available at the time the standard was set. Fast modern electronics allows digital information to be encoded into the signal during the vertical blanking interval; it is not displayed on screen as the beam is blanked, but can be processed by appropriate circuitry.

[[Image:Wellhead-dual completion.jpg|right|thumb|Oil well Christmas tree]]

In [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] extraction, a '''Christmas tree''', or "tree", is an assembly of valves, spools, and fittings used to regulate the flow of pipes in an [[oil well]], gas well, water injection well, water disposal well, gas injection well, condensate well and other types of wells.  It was named for its  resemblance to the series of starting lights at a drag racing strip ([[Christmas tree (drag racing)]]).

== Overview ==

Christmas trees are used on both surface and subsea wells. It is common to identify the type of tree as either "subsea tree" or "surface tree".  Each of these classifications has a number of variations.  Examples of subsea include conventional, dual bore, mono bore, TFL (through flow line), horizontal, mudline, mudline horizontal, side valve, and TBT (through-bore tree) trees. The deepest installed subsea tree is in the Gulf of Mexico at approximately {{convert|9000|ft|m}}. (Current technical limits are up to around 3000 metres and working temperatures of -50°F to 350°F with a pressure of up to 15,000 psi.)

The primary function of a tree is to control the flow, usually [[petroleum|oil]] or [[natural gas|gas]], out of the well. (A tree may also be used to control the injection of gas or water into a non-producing well in order to enhance production rates of oil from other wells.) When the well and facilities are ready to produce and receive oil or gas, tree valves are opened and the formation fluids are allowed to go through a flow line.  This leads to a processing facility, storage depot and/or other pipeline eventually leading to a [[Oil refinery|refinery]] or distribution center (for gas).  Flow lines on subsea wells usually lead to a fixed or floating production platform or to a storage ship or barge, known as a floating storage offloading vessel (FSO), or floating processing unit (FPU), or floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO).

A tree often provides numerous additional functions including chemical injection points, well intervention means, pressure relief means, monitoring points (such as pressure, temperature, corrosion, erosion, sand detection, flow rate, flow composition, valve and choke position feedback), and connection points for devices such as down hole pressure and temperature transducers (DHPT). On producing wells, chemicals or alcohols or oil distillates may be injected to preclude production problems (such as blockages).

Functionality may be extended further by using the control system on a subsea tree to monitor, measure, and react to sensor outputs on the tree or even down the well bore. The control system attached to the tree controls the downhole safety valve (SCSSV, DHSV, SSSV) while the tree acts as an attachment and conduit means of the control system to the downhole safety valve.

Tree complexity has increased over the last few decades.  They are frequently manufactured from blocks of steel containing multiple valves rather than being assembled from individual flanged components.  This is especially true in [[subsea]] applications where the resemblance to Christmas trees no longer exists given the frame and support systems into which the main valve block is integrated.

Note that a tree and [[wellhead]] are separate pieces of equipment not to be mistaken as the same piece.  The Christmas tree is installed on top of the wellhead. A wellhead is used without a Christmas tree during drilling operations, and also for riser tie-back situations that later would have a tree installed at riser top.  Wells being produced with rod pumps (pump jacks, nodding donkeys, grasshopper pumps, and so on) frequently do not utilize any tree owing the absence of a pressure-containment requirement.

==Valves==
Subsea and surface trees have a large variety of valve configurations and combinations of manual and/or actuated (hydraulic or pneumatic) valves.  Examples are identified in API Specifications 6A and 17D.

A basic surface tree consists of two or three manual valves (usually [[gate valve]]s because of their flow characteristics, i.e. low restriction to the flow of fluid when fully open).

A typical sophisticated surface tree will have at least four or five valves, normally arranged in a crucifix type pattern (hence the endurance of the term "Christmas tree").  The two lower valves are called the master valves (upper and lower respectively). Master valves are normally in the fully open position and are ''never'' opened or closed when the well is flowing (except in an emergency) to prevent erosion of the valve sealing surfaces.  The lower master valve will normally be manually operated, while the upper master valve is often hydraulically actuated, allowing it to be used as a means of remotely shutting in the well in the event of emergency. An actuated wing valve is normally used to shut in the well when flowing, thus preserving the master valves for positive shut off for maintenance purposes. Hydraulic operated wing valves are usually built to be fail safe closed, meaning they require active hydraulic pressure to stay open. This feature means that if control fluid fails the well will automatically shut itself in without operator action.

The right hand valve is often called the flow wing valve or the production wing valve, because it is in the flowpath the hydrocarbons take to production facilities (or the path water or gas will take from production to the well in the case of injection wells). 

The left hand valve is often called the kill wing valve (KWV).  It is primarily used for injection of fluids such as corrosion inhibitors or methanol to prevent hydrate formation.  In the North Sea, it is called the non-active side arm (NASA).  It is typically manually operated.

The valve at the top is called the swab valve and lies in the path used for [[well intervention]]s like [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] and [[coiled tubing]].  For such operations, a lubricator is rigged up onto the top of the tree and the wire or coil is lowered through the lubricator, past the swab valve and into the well.  This valve is typically manually operated.

Some trees have a second swab valve, the two arranged one on top of the other.  The intention is to allow rigging down equipment from the top of the tree with the well flowing while still preserving the [[two-barrier rule]].  With only a single swab valve, the upper master valve is usually closed to act as the second barrier, forcing the well to be shut in for a day during rig down operations.  However, avoiding delaying production for a day is usually too small a gain to be worth the extra expense of having a Christmas tree with a second swab valve.

Subsea trees are available in either vertical or horizontal configurations with further speciality available such as dual bore, monobore, concentric, drill-through, mudline, guidlineless or guideline.  Subsea trees may range in size and weight from a few tons to approximately 70 tons for high pressure, deepwater (&gt;3000 feet) guidelineless applications.  Subsea trees contain many additional valves and accessories compared to surface trees.  Typically a subsea tree would have a choke (permits control of flow), a flowline connection interface (hub, flange or other connection), subsea control interface (direct hydraulic, electro hydraulic, or electric) and sensors for gathering data such as pressure, temperature, sand flow, erosion, multiphase flow, single phase flow such as water or gas.

'''Clarence Walker Seamans''' (June 5, 1854 – May 30, 1915) was an [[United States|American]] [[typewriter]] manufacturer and executive of several organizations involved in the production and sale of the Remington typewriter, including the Union Typewriter Company and the [[Remington Typewriter Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingham 1973, p. 1269&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early life===
Seamans was born June 5, 1854 in [[Ilion, New York]] to Abner Clark Seamans and Caroline Matilda Williams.&lt;ref name="Homans517"&gt;Homans 1918, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt;  Seamans began work as a clerk at [[E. Remington and Sons]], the firm at which his father was a purchasing agent, at the age of fifteen.{{#tag:ref|Alternatively, Seamans is reported to have begun at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name="Homans517"/&gt;|group="Note"}}  In 1875, he began a three year stint of overseeing a [[silver]] mine in [[Bingham Canyon, Utah]].  Upon returning to the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], Seamans became a bookkeeper and salesman at Fairbanks &amp; Company, a scale manufacturer.  Fairbanks had become the sole marketer of the [[Sholes and Glidden typewriter]], produced by Seaman's former employer, E. Remington and Sons.  After 1879, Seamans lived in [[Brooklyn]] with his wife Ida Gertrude Watson and their two daughters, Mabel and Dorothy.&lt;ref name="ingham1270"&gt;Ingham 1973, p. 1270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard 1909, p. 1162&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:(King1893NYC) pg965 WYCKOFF, SEAMANS &amp; BENEDICT I INTERIOR OF REMINGTON STANDARD TYPEWRITER HEADQUARTERS.jpg|thumb|REMINGTON STANDARD TYPEWRITER HEADQUARTERS]]

===Involvement with the Remington typewriter===
In 1881, marketing of the typewriter returned to Remington.  Seamans had been a "star typewriter salesman" and was retained and made manager of sales.&lt;ref&gt;Masi 1985, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, Seamans partnered with [[Harry H. Benedict]], a Remington director, and [[William O. Wyckoff]], a Remington sales agent, to form the firm of Wyckoff, Seamans &amp; Benedict.  In 1886, Wyckoff, Seamans &amp; Benedict purchased the typewriter business from Remington and, in 1892, formed the Remington Standard Typewriter Company with Seamans as the treasurer and general manager.  A year later, Seamans was made president of the Union Typewriter Company, a [[Trust (19th century)|trust]] formed from the merger of Remington Standard with several prominent typewriter manufacturers.  Seamans presided over the acquisition of the Wahl Adding Machine Company, which made Union the world's largest typewriter company.&lt;ref name="ingham1270"/&gt;  Seamans remained president until being elected to [[chairman|chairman of the board]] in 1913.  During this time, Seamans held a director position at several [[trust company|trust companies]] and an insurance company.&lt;ref name="ingham1270"/&gt;

Seamans died at his summer home in [[Pigeon Cove, Massachusetts]] on May 30, 1915.&lt;ref name="Homans518"&gt;Homans 1918, p. 518&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3592">The '''Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy''' was chaired by [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]] from 1916 to 1918. Balfour instructed its members to "cast aside any abstract fiscal dogmas".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barton Johnson, ''Land Fit For Heroes. The Planning of British Reconstruction. 1916-1919'' (London: The University of Chicago Press, 1968), pp. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[Paris Economy Pact|Paris Economic Conference]] of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] resolved to damage the [[Central Powers]] economically.&lt;ref&gt;John Turner, ''British Politics and the Great War. Coalition and Conflict. 1915-1918'' (London: Yale University Press, 1992), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[H. H. Asquith]] appointed the committee in July 1916 in order to implement the Paris Resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee included [[William Hewins|W. A. S. Hewins]] (Conservative), [[Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon|Lord Faringdon]] (Conservative), [[Alfred Mond]] (Liberal), [[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|Lord Rhondda]] (Liberal), [[Jack Pease, 1st Baron Gainford|J. A. Pease]] (Liberal), [[George Wardle]] (Labour), Sir [[Henry Birchenough]] and [[Richard Hazleton]] (Irish Nationalist).&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/finalreportofcom00grearich/finalreportofcom00grearich_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports==

The committee's interim report on certain essential industries argued for a Special Industries Board to scrutinise industrial development and promote the manufacture of strategically essential products. This Board should offer state support for efficient businesses but "failing efficient and adequate output, the Government should itself undertake the manufacture of such articles as may be essential for national safety".&lt;ref&gt;Correlli Barnett, ''The Collapse of British Power'' (London: Eyre &amp; Methuen, 1972), pp. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee's final report dealt with the future of British industry both in commercial competitiveness and capacity for war:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is in our opinion a matter of vital importance that, alike in the old-established industries and in the new branches of manufacture which have arisen during the war, both employer and employed should make every effort to attain the largest possible volume of production, by the increased efficiency of industrial organisation and processes, by more intensive working, and by the adoption of the best and most economical methods of distribution.&lt;br /&gt;[And] it is only by the attainment of this maximum production and efficiency that we can hope to secure a speedy recovery of the industrial and financial position of the United Kingdom and assure its economic stability and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''David Zeiger''' (February 21, 1918 - May 10, 1981) Brazilian industrialist in the area of clothing and fashion.

Zeiger's family immigrated from [[Ukraine]] (the part of Ukraine that was then part of [[Poland]]) to [[Brazil]] in the early 1920s. David, with his siblings and mother, met with his father Shaja Zeiger, who had left Poland a year earlier. Shaja Zeiger was a tailor, and in a few years founded Goomtex, a factory for raincoats and overcoats. As a young man, David Zeiger worked with his father, and soon became the manager of the business. After his marriage, David Zeiger began to run Pullsport—a women's fashion factory—along with his wife [[Mila Zeiger|Mila]].

David Zeiger also dedicated his energy to the areas of culture, philanthropy, and publicity.

==Early Years and Education==
[[Image:David Zeiger Diploma do clube portugues 1964.jpg|thumb|left]]
Zeiger was born in [[Kovel]], Poland, which is now part of [[Ukraine]]. Although raised and educated within the community of Jewish immigrants in the [[São Paulo]] neighborhood of [[Bom Retiro (District of São Paulo)|Bom Retiro]], the adolescent Zeiger already had a good command of Portuguese and a curiosity for Brazilian culture that led him to seek friendships outside the small European community where he lived.

He became a member of the Espéria club, and of the Tietê [[regatta]] club in which he participated as a rower in competitions. He joined the Portugália club, which published a newspaper with texts written by various members. His news stories and fiction began to be published under the guidance of the poet Mario Gallo. Zeiger finished his education at the São Paulo Technical School of Accounting.

==Community Activities==

[[Image:David Zeiger Carta de Scylla Medici 1972-01-27.jpg|thumb|right|180px]]
After [[World War II]], Zeiger began his philanthropic activities. He helped raise funds and contributed his own resources to the newly created state of [[Israel]].

Most of his efforts were for social causes focused on Brazil. He assisted Carmem Prudente in the establishment of the [[Institute of Cancer of São Paulo|Hospital do Câncer]], and in the charitable campaigns that followed. 

[[Image:Diploma de Benemérito - Hospital Albert Einstein.jpg|miniaturadaimagem|180x180px|right]]
He was an initial donor of the [[Albert Einstein Hospital|Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein]]. He gave medical access to his employees through the  network of SERMA clinics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sermasaude.org/rede-credenciada-da-serma.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship and Politics==
[[Image:David Zeiger com Deputado Cunha Bueno.jpg|thumb|right|260px]]
[[Image:David Zeiger com Pele.jpg|thumb|left|120px]]
Zeiger believed in a Brazil based on the market economy of the United States—with a vast middle class, general access to education and medical services. During the [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] administration (1956 to 1961), he found a favorable climate for this view, which would help Brazil to move out of its agrarian economy to become an industrial giant. At that time Zeiger met congressman Antônio Sílvio Cunha Bueno, with whom he developed a long friendship, and through which he began to participate more actively in the political life of the country. Zeiger promoted Cunha Bueno within the Jewish community. The friendship with the Cunha Bueno family resulted in two homages: David Zeiger Public School, and David Zeiger Street, both in São Paulo.

==Career==
[[Image:Marca Pull Sport.jpg|thumb|left|150px]]
During the years of the "Economic Miracle" in the 1960s and 1970s, David Zeiger's business expanded quickly. His factory (Cia Pullsport of Malharia) grew to occupy two buildings of seven floors with 500 employees.

In 1967, [[Time Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine, ''Brazil's President Costa e Silva'', 1967/04/21&lt;/ref&gt; published a cover story with the photo of [[Artur da Costa e Silva|President Costa e Silva]]. The subject was the surge of progress in the economy of Brazil. It quoted examples of leaders in various fields of activity, and presented Zeiger as an example of an industrialist. Zeiger had an unpretentious and communicative character, which he demonstrated equally with both his company employees and important personalities.

==Other interests==

[[Image:David Zeiger Homenagem da Fundação Bienal de São Paulo 1981 Carta Luiz Villares.jpg|thumb|right]]
Zeiger participated from the beginning in the textile fairs established by Caio de Alcântara Machado (FENIT), the board of directors of the International Art Biennial of São Paulo&lt;ref&gt;''(In Portuguese)'' XVI Bienal de São Paulo, ''http://issuu.com/bienal/docs/nameafc024'', Homenagem da Fundação Bienal de São Paulo, 16 outubro a 20 de dezembro de 1981&lt;/ref&gt; , and sponsored a project aimed at integrating a cultural center with theaters and concert halls in the [[Ibirapuera Park]]. He was also an art collector. In his view, the city of São Paulo had the potential to become the most important metropolis in [[Latin America]].

[[Image:EAN8.svg|thumbnail| Number encoded in an EAN-8 barcode.]]
An '''EAN-8''' is an EAN/UPC symbology [[barcode]] and is derived from the longer [[International Article Number]] ([[EAN-13]]) code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EAN-8 barcode|url=http://ocp.gs1.org/sites/glossary/en-gb/Pages/EAN-8%20barcode.aspx|website=Glossary|publisher=GS1|accessdate=16 March 2017|language=en|date=March 2016|quote=A barcode of the EAN/UPC symbology that encodes GTIN-8 or RCN-8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced for use on small packages where an EAN-13 barcode would be too large; for example on [[cigarettes]], [[pencils]], and [[chewing gum]] packets. It is encoded identically to the 12 digits of the [[UPC-A]] barcode, except that it has 4 (rather than 6) digits in each of the left and right halves.{{citation needed|reason=that it is encoded identically to UPC needs to be sourced and explained|date=March 2017}}

EAN-8 barcodes may be used to encode GTIN-8 (8-digit Global Trade Identification Numbers) which are product identifiers from the GS1 System. A GTIN-8 begins with a 2- or 3-digit GS1 prefix (which is assigned to each national GS1 authority) followed by a 5- or 4-digit item reference element depending on the length of the GS1 prefix), and a checksum digit.

EAN-8 codes are common throughout the world, and companies may also use them to encode RCN-8 (8-digit Restricted Circulation Numbers), and use them to identify own-brand products sold only in their stores. RCN-8 are a subset of GTIN-8 which begin with a first digit of 0 or 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=GS1 AISBL|title=GS1 General Specifications|url=http://www.gs1.org./docs/barcodes/GS1_General_Specifications.pdf|publisher=GS1|accessdate=2017-03-16|language=en|format=Portable Document Format|chapter=Section 2.1.6.1|quote=The RCN-8 Prefixes 0 or 2 are system identifiers that show that the item identification number is under the sole control of the assigning company and that it is for internal item distribution. The item reference is allocated by the company that uses the element string. The positions N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to N&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; may contain any digit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electroactive polymers''', or '''EAPs''', are [[polymer]]s that exhibit a change in size or shape when stimulated by an [[electric field]]. The most common applications of this type of material are in [[actuator]]s&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles&gt;{{cite web |url= https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/37602/05-1898.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y |title=Bar-Cohen, Yoseph: "Artificial Muscles using Electroactive Polymers (EAP): Capabilities, Challenges and Potential}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sensor]]s.&lt;ref name=EAPsensing&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wang, T. |author2=Farajollahi, M. |author3=Choi, Y.S. |author4=Lin, I.T. |author5=Marshall, J.E. |author6=Thompson, N.M. |author7=Kar-Narayan, S. |author8=Madden, J.D.W. |author9= Smoukov, S.K. |title= Electroactive polymers for sensing |url= http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/20160026 |year=2016 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=1–19 |doi= 10.1098/rsfs.2016.0026 |pmc= 4918837}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical characteristic property of an EAP is that they will undergo a large amount of deformation while sustaining large [[force]]s.

The majority of historic actuators are made of [[ceramic]] [[piezoelectric]] materials. While these materials are able to withstand large forces, they commonly will only deform a fraction of a percent. In the late 1990s, it has been demonstrated that some EAPs can exhibit up to a 380% [[strain (mechanics) |strain]], which is much more than any ceramic actuator.&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles/&gt; One of the most common applications for EAPs is in the field of [[robotics]] in the development of artificial muscles; thus, an electroactive polymer is often referred to as an [[artificial muscle]].
{{toclimit|3}}

==History==
The field of EAPs emerged back in 1880, when [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] designed an experiment in which he tested the effect of an electrostatic field on the mechanical properties of a stripe of natural rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Keplinger |first=Christoph |last2= Kaltenbrunner |first2=Martin |last3=Arnold |first3=Nikita |last4=Bauer |first4= Siegfried |date= 2010-03-09 |title= Röntgen's electrode-free elastomer actuators without electromechanical pull-in instability |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/107/10/4505 |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=10 |pages=4505–4510 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.0913461107 |issn=0027-8424 |pmc=2825178 |pmid= 20173097}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rubber stripe was fixed at one end and was attached to a [[mass]] at the other. Electric charges were then sprayed onto the rubber, and it was observed that the length changed. It was in 1925 that the first [[piezoelectric]] polymer was discovered ([[Electret]]). Electret was formed by combining [[carnauba wax]], [[rosin]] and [[beeswax]], and then cooling the solution while it is subject to an applied [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electrical bias]]. The mixture would then solidify into a polymeric material that exhibited a [[piezoelectric effect]].

Polymers that respond to environmental conditions, other than an applied [[electric current]], have also been a large part of this area of study. In 1949 Katchalsky ''et al.'' demonstrated that when [[collagen]] filaments are dipped in [[acid]] or [[alkali]] solutions, they would respond with a change in [[volume]].&lt;ref name="ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm |title=Electrochemistry Encyclopedia: Electroactive Polymers (EAP) |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212015419/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-p02-elact-pol.htm |archivedate= 2012-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collagen filaments were found to expand in an [[acidic]] solution and contract in an [[alkali]] solution. Although other stimuli (such as [[pH]]) have been investigated, due to its ease and practicality most research has been devoted to developing polymers that respond to electrical stimuli in order to mimic biological systems.

The next major breakthrough in EAPs took place in the late 1960s. In 1969 Kawai demonstrated that [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF) exhibits a large piezoelectric effect.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; This sparked research interest in developing other polymers systems that would show a similar effect. In 1977 the first electrically [[conducting polymer]]s were discovered by [[Hideki Shirakawa]] ''et al.''&lt;ref name=EAPHistory&gt;{{cite journal |author= Finkenstadt, Victoria L. |title=Natural polysaccharides as electroactive polymers |journal=Appl Microbiol Biotechnol |year=2005 |volume=67 |pmid= 15724215 |issue=6 |pages= 735–745 |doi= 10.1007/s00253-005-1931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shirakawa along with [[Alan MacDiarmid]] and [[Alan Heeger]] demonstrated that [[polyacetylene]] was electrically conductive, and that by doping it with [[iodine]] vapor, they could enhance its [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] by 8 orders of magnitude. Thus the [[electrical conductance|conductance]] was close to that of a metal. By the late 1980s a number of other polymers had been shown to exhibit a [[piezoelectric effect]] or were demonstrated to be conductive.

In the early 1990s, [[ionic polymer-metal composite]]s (IPMCs) were developed and shown to exhibit electroactive properties far superior to previous EAPs. The major advantage of IPMCs was that they were able to show activation (deformation) at [[voltage]]s as low as 1 or 2 [[volt]]s.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; This is orders of magnitude less than any previous EAP. Not only was the activation energy for these materials much lower, but they could also undergo much larger deformations. IPMCs were shown to exhibit anywhere up to 380% strain, orders of magnitude larger than previously developed EAPs.&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles /&gt;

In 1999, [[Yoseph Bar-Cohen]] proposed the [[Armwrestling Match of EAP Robotic Arm Against Human]] Challenge.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; This was a challenge in which research groups around the world competed to design a robotic arm consisting of EAP muscles that could defeat a human in an [[arm wrestling]] match. The first challenge was held at the Electroactive Polymer Actuators and Devices Conference in 2005.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia /&gt; Another major milestone of the field is that the first commercially developed device including EAPs as an artificial muscle was produced in 2002 by Eamex in Japan.&lt;ref name=ArtificialMuscles /&gt; This device was a fish that was able to swim on its own, moving its tail using an EAP muscle. But the progress in practical development has not been satisfactory.&lt;ref name=Mistakes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ali Eftekhari |title=Comment on "A Linear Actuation of Polymeric Nanofibrous Bundle for Artificial Muscles" |journal= Chemistry of Materials |year=2010 |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=2689 |doi= 10.1021/cm903343t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DARPA]]-funded research in the 1990s at [[SRI International]] and led by Ron Pelrine developed an electroactive polymer using silicone and acrylic polymers; the technology was spun off into the company [[Artificial Muscle (company)|Artificial Muscle]] in 2003, with industrial production beginning in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avsusergroups.org/tfug_pdfs/2008_2feldman.pdf|title=Electroactive Polymer Artificial Muscle - A Polymer Based Generator?|first=Randy|last=Feldman|work=Thin Film Users Group|publisher=Northern California Chapter of the American Vacuum Society|date=2008-02-20|accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Artificial Muscle became a subsidiary of [[Bayer MaterialScience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sri.com/engage/products-solutions/epam|title=Electroactive Polymer "Artificial Muscle"|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
EAP can have several configurations, but are generally divided in two principal classes: Dielectric and Ionic.

===Dielectric===
[[Dielectric elastomers|Dielectric EAPs]] are materials in which actuation is caused by [[electrostatic]] forces between two electrodes which squeeze the polymer. Dielectric elastomers are capable of very high strains and are fundamentally a capacitor that changes its capacitance when a voltage is applied by allowing the polymer to compress in thickness and expand in area due to the electric field. This type of EAP typically requires a large actuation voltage to produce high electric fields (hundreds to thousands of [[volt]]s), but very low [[electrical]] [[power (physics)|power]] consumption. Dielectric EAPs require no power to keep the actuator at a given position. Examples are electrostrictive polymers and dielectric elastomers.

====Ferroelectric polymers====
[[Ferroelectric polymers]] are a group of crystalline polar polymers that are also [[ferroelectric]], meaning that they maintain a permanent [[electric polarization]] that can be reversed, or switched, in an external [[electric field]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ferroelectric Properties of Vinylidene Fluoride Copolymers," by T. Furukawa, in ''Phase Transitions'', Vol. '''18''', pp. 143-211 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Polymers"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Nalwa |first1= H. |title= Ferroelectric Polymers |edition= First |year= 1995 |publisher= Marcel Dekker, INC. |location= New York |isbn= 0-8247-9468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferroelectric polymers, such as [[polyvinylidene fluoride]] (PVDF), are used in acoustic transducers and electromechanical actuators because of their inherent [[piezoelectric]] response, and as heat sensors because of their inherent [[pyroelectric]] response.&lt;ref name=lovinger&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1126/science.220.4602.1115 | author=Lovinger, A.J. | title=Ferroelectric polymers. | journal=Science | year=1983 | volume=220 | issue=4602 | pages=1115–1121 | pmid=17818472}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[image:Polyvinylidene fluoride.png|right|thumb|Figure 1: Structure of Poly(vinylidene fluoride)]]

====Electrostrictive graft polymers====
[[image:Electrostrictive Graft PolymerII.PNG|thumb|300px|left|Figure 2: Cartoon of an electrostrictive graft polymer.]]

Electrostrictive graft polymers consist of flexible backbone chains with branching side chains. The side chains on neighboring backbone polymers cross link and form crystal units. The backbone and side chain crystal units can then form polarized monomers, which contain atoms with partial charges and generate dipole moments, shown in Figure 2.&lt;ref name="Electrostrictive Graft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Youqi|author2=Changjie Sun |author3=Eric Zhou |author4=Ji Su |year=2004|title=Deformation Mechanisms of Electrostrictive Graft Elastomers|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing|volume=13|pages=1407–1413|issn=0964-1726 |doi=10.1088/0964-1726/13/6/011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an electrical field is applied, a force is applied to each partial charge and causes rotation of the whole polymer unit. This rotation causes electrostrictive strain and deformation of the polymer.

====Liquid crystalline polymers====
Main-chain liquid crystalline polymers have [[mesogen]]ic groups linked to each other by a flexible spacer. The mesogens within a backbone form the mesophase structure causing the polymer itself to adopt a conformation compatible with the structure of the mesophase. The direct coupling of the liquid crystalline order with the polymer conformation has given main-chain liquid crystalline elastomers a large amount of interest.&lt;ref name="LCpol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ishige|first=Ryohei|author2=Masatoshi Tokita |author3=Yu Naito |author4=Chun Ying Zhang |author5=Junji Watanabe |date=January 22, 2008|title=Unusual Formation of Smectic A Structure in Cross-Linked Monodomain Elastomer of Main-Chain LC Polyester with 3-Methylpentane Spacer|journal=Macromolecules|publisher=American Chemical Society|volume=41|issue=7|pages=2671–2676|doi=10.1021/ma702686c}}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis of highly oriented elastomers leads to have a large strain thermal actuation along the polymer chain direction with temperature variation resulting in unique mechanical properties and potential applications as mechanical actuators.

===Ionic===
*[[Ion]]ic EAPs, in which actuation is caused by the displacement of ions inside the polymer. Only a few volts are needed for actuation, but the ionic flow implies a higher electrical power needed for actuation, and energy is needed to keep the actuator at a given position. Examples of ionic EAPS are [[conductive polymer]]s, [[ionic polymer-metal composite]]s (IPMCs), and responsive gels. Yet another example is a Bucky gel actuator, which is a polymer-supported layer of [[polyelectrolyte]] material consisting of an [[ionic liquid]] sandwiched between two [[electrode]] layers consisting of a [[gel]] of ionic liquid containing single-wall [[carbon nanotube]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs2008.47|author1=Qu, L. |author2=Peng, Q. |author3=Dai, L. |author4=Spinks, G.M. |author5=Wallace, G.G. |author6=Baughman, R.H. |title=Carbon Nanotube Electroactive Polymer Materials: Opportunities and Challenges|journal=MRS Bulletin|year=2008|volume=33|issue=03|pages=215–224}}{{ ISSN|0883-7694}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from the similarity of the gel to the paper that can be made by filtering carbon nanotubes, the so-called [[buckypaper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/110429473/ABSTRACT ''Fully Plastic Actuator through Layer-by-Layer Casting with Ionic-Liquid-Based Bucky Gel''] Takanori Fukushima, Kinji Asaka, Atsuko Kosaka, Takuzo Aida p.

====Electrorheological fluid====
{{Main|Electrorheological Fluid}}

[[Image:EAP-composite.png|300px|thumb|Center| Figure 3: The cations in the ionic polymer-metal composite are randomly oriented in the absence of an electric field. Once a field is applied the cations gather to the side of the polymer in contact with the anode causing the polymer to bend.]]

Electrorheological fluids change the viscosity of a solution with the application of an electric field. The fluid is a suspension of polymers in a low dielectric-constant liquid.&lt;ref name="Polymer Rheology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glass|first=J. Edward|author2=Schulz, Donald N. |author3=Zukosi, C.F |title=Polymers as Rheology Modifiers|publisher=American Chemical Society|date=May 13, 1991|series=ACS Symposium Series|volume=462|pages=2–17|chapter=1|isbn=9780841220096}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the application of a large electric field the viscosity of the suspension increases. Potential applications of these fluids include shock absorbers, engine mounts and acoustic dampers.&lt;ref name="Polymer Rheology" /&gt;

====Ionic polymer-metal composite====
{{Main|Ionic polymer-metal composite}}

Ionic polymer-metal composites consist of a thin ionomeric membrane with noble metal electrodes plated on its surface. It also has cations to balance the charge of the anions fixed to the polymer backbone.&lt;ref name="IPM composites"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemat-Nasser|first=S.|author2=Thomas, C.|title=Electroactive Polymer (EAP) Actuators as Articifial Muscles-Reality, Potential and Challenges|editor=Yoseph Bar-Cohen|publisher=SPIE Press|year=2001|pages=139–191|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are very active [[actuator]]s that show very high deformation at low applied voltage and show low impedance. Ionic polymer-metal composites work through electrostatic attraction between the cationic counter ions and the cathode of the applied electric field, a schematic representation is shown in Figure 3. These types of polymers show the greatest promise for bio-mimetic uses as collagen fibers are essentially composed of natural charged ionic polymers.&lt;ref name="IPMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndeaa.jpl.nasa.gov/nasa-nde/papers/spie98/SPIE98-mo.PDF|title=Ionic Polymer-Metal Composties (IPMC) As Biomimetic Sensors and Actuators|last=Shahinpoor|first=M. |author2=Y. Bar-Cohen |author3=T. Xue |author4=J.O. Simpson |author5=J. Smith|date=5 March 1996|publisher=SPIE|pages=17|accessdate=6 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nafion and Flemion are commonly used ionic polymer metal composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs2008.44|author1=Park, I.S. |author2=Jung, K. |author3=Kim, D. |author4=Kim, S.M |author5=Kim, K.J. |title=Physical Principles of Ionic Polymer–Metal Composites as Electroactive Actuators and Sensors|journal=MRS Bulletin|year=2008|volume=33|issue=03|pages=190–195}}{{ ISSN|0883-7694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stimuli-responsive gels====
Stimuli-responsive gels (hydrogels, when the swelling agent is an aqueous solution) are a special kind of swellable polymer networks with volume phase transition behaviour. These materials change reversibly their volume, optical, mechanical and other properties by very small alterations of certain physical (e.g. electric field, light, temperature) or chemical (concentrations) stimuli. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last= Zolfagharian |first=Ali |author2= Abbas Z. Kouzani |author3= Sui Yang Khoo |author4= Akif Kaynak |year=2016 |title=3D printed hydrogel soft actuators |work=In Region 10 Conference (TENCON), 2016 IEEE |publisher=IEEE |doi= 10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume change of these materials occurs by swelling/shrinking and is diffusion-based. Gels provide the biggest change in volume of solid-state materials.&lt;ref name ="Hydrogel Sensors and Actuators"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gerlach |first1= G. |last2= Arndt |first2= K.-F. |title= Hydrogel Sensors and Actuators |edition= First |year= 2009 |publisher= Springer |location= Berlin |isbn= 978-3-540-75644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with an excellent compatibility with micro-fabrication technologies, especially stimuli-responsive hydrogels are of strong increasing interest for microsystems with sensors and actuators. Current fields of research and application are chemical sensor systems, microfluidics and multimodal imaging systems.

==Comparison of dielectric and ionic EAPs==
Dielectric polymers are able to hold their induced displacement while activated under a DC voltage.&lt;ref name="Editorial"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bar-Cohen |first=Yoseph |author2= Kwang J Kim |author3=Hyouk Ryeol Choi |author4=John D W Madden |year=2007 |title= Electroactive Polymer Materials |journal= Smart Materials and Structures |publisher= Institute of Physics Publishing |volume=16 |issue=2 |doi= 10.1088/0964-1726/16/2/E01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows dielectric polymers to be considered for robotic applications. These types of materials also have high mechanical energy density and can be operated in air without a major decrease in performance. However, dielectric polymers require very high activation fields (&gt;10&amp;nbsp;V/µm) that are close to the breakdown level.

The activation of ionic polymers, on the other hand, requires only 1-2&amp;nbsp;volts. They however need to maintain wetness, though some polymers have been developed as self-contained encapsulated activators which allows their use in dry environments.&lt;ref name=IPMC /&gt; Ionic polymers also have a low electromechanical coupling. They are however ideal for bio-mimetic devices.

==Characterization==
While there are many different ways electroactive polymers can be characterized, only three will be addressed here: stress–strain curve, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and dielectric thermal analysis.

===Stress–strain curve===
{{Main|Stress–strain curve}}
[[image:LCpolymersII.png|thumb|250px|right|Figure 4: The unstressed polymer spontaneously forms a folded structure, upon application of a stress the polymer regains its original length.]]
Stress strain curves provide information about the polymer's mechanical properties such as the brittleness, elasticity and yield strength of the polymer. This is done by providing a force to the polymer at a uniform rate and measuring the deformation that results.&lt;ref name="Textbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowie|first=J.M.G.|author2=Valerai Arrighi|title=Polymers: Chemistry and Physics of Modern Material|publisher=CRC Press|location=Florida|year=2008|edition=Third|pages=363–373|chapter=13|isbn=978-0-8493-9813-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this deformation is shown in Figure 4. This technique is useful for determining the type of material (brittle, tough, etc.), but it is a destructive technique as the stress is increased until the polymer fractures.

===Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA)===
{{Main|Dynamic mechanical analysis}}

Both dynamic mechanical analysis is a non destructive technique that is useful in understanding the mechanism of deformation at a molecular level. In DMTA a sinusoidal stress is applied to the polymer, and based on the polymer's deformation the [[elastic modulus]] and damping characteristics are obtained (assuming the polymer is a [[damped harmonic oscillator]]).&lt;ref name=Textbook /&gt; Elastic materials take the mechanical energy of the stress and convert it into potential energy which can later be recovered. An ideal spring will use all the potential energy to regain its original shape (no damping), while a liquid will use all the potential energy to flow, never returning to its original position or shape (high damping). A viscoeleastic polymer will exhibit a combination of both types of behavior.&lt;ref name=Textbook /&gt;

===Dielectric thermal analysis (DETA)===
{{Main|Dielectric thermal analysis}}

DETA is similar to DMTA, but instead of an alternating mechanical force an alternating electric field is applied. The applied field can lead to polarization of the sample, and if the polymer contains groups that have permanent dipoles (as in Figure 2), they will align with the electrical field.&lt;ref name= Textbook /&gt; The [[permittivity]] can be measured from the change in amplitude and resolved into dielectric storage and loss components. The [[electric displacement field]] can also be measured by following the current.&lt;ref name=Textbook /&gt; Once the field is removed, the dipoles will relax back into a random orientation.

==Applications==
[[Image:Artificial Muscle.png|300px|thumb|Figure 5: Cartoon drawing of an arm controlled by EAPs. When a voltage is applied (blue muscles) the polymer expands. When the voltage is removed (red muscles) the polymer returns to its original state.]]EAP materials can be easily manufactured into various shapes due to the ease in processing many polymeric materials, making them very versatile materials. One potential application for EAPs is that they can potentially be integrated into [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) to produce smart actuators.

===Artificial muscles===
As the most prospective practical research direction, EAPs have been used in artificial muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first= K.J.|author2=Tadokoro, S.|title=Electroactive Polymers for Robotic Applications, Artificial Muscles and Sensors|publisher=Springer|location=London|year=2007|isbn=978-1-84628-371-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zolfagharian|first=Ali|author2=Abbas Z.

===Tactile displays===
In recent years, "electro active polymers for refreshable [[Braille]] displays"&lt;ref name="Electroactive polymers for refreshable Braille displays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spie.org/x37076.xml?ArticleID=x37076|title=Electroactive polymers for refreshable Braille displays|last=Bar-Cohen|first=Yoseph|date=11 September 2009|publisher=SPIE}}&lt;/ref&gt; has emerged to aid the visually impaired in fast reading and computer assisted communication. This concept is based on using an EAP actuator configured in an array form. Rows of [[electrode]]s on one side of an EAP film and columns on the other activate individual elements in the array. Each element is mounted with a Braille dot and is lowered by applying a voltage across the thickness of the selected element, causing local thickness reduction. Under computer control, dots would be activated to create tactile patterns of highs and lows representing the information to be read.

[[File:Artificial skin.jpg|thumb|Figure 6: High resolution tactile display consisting of 4,320 (60x72) actuator pixels based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels. The integration density of the device is 297 components per cm². This display gives visual (monochromic) and physical (contours, relief, textures, softness) impressions of a virtual surface.]]Visual and tactile impressions of a virtual surface are displayed by a high resolution tactile display, a so-called "artificial skin" (Fig.6) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200802737|author1=Richter, A. |author2=Paschew, G. |title=Optoelectrothermic Control of Highly Integrated Polymer-Based MEMS Applied in an Artificial Skin|journal=Advanced Materials|year=2009|volume=21|issue=9|pages=979–983}}&lt;/ref&gt; These monolithic devices consist of an array of thousands of multimodal modulators (actuator pixels) based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels. Each modulator is able to change individually their transmission, height and softness. Besides their possible use as graphic displays for visually impaired such displays are interesting as free programmable keys of touchpads and consoles.

===Microfluidics===
EAP materials have huge potential for microfluidics e.g. as [[drug delivery]] systems, [[microfluidic device]]s and [[lab-on-a-chip]]. A first microfluidic platform technology reported in literature is based on stimuli-responsive gels. To avoid the electrolysis of water hydrogel-based microfluidic devices are mainly based on temperature-responsive polymers with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) characteristics, which are controlled by an electrothermic interface. Two types of micropumps are known, a diffusion micropump and a displacement micropump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/B810256B |author1=Richter, A. |author2=Klatt, S. |author3=Paschew, G. |author4=Klenke, C. |title=Micropumps operated by swelling and shrinking of temperature-sensitive hydrogels|journal=Lab on a Chip|year=2009|volume=9| pages=613–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microvalves based on stimuli-responsive hydrogels show some advantageous properties such as particle tolerance, no leakage and outstanding pressure resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/JMEMS.2003.817898|author1=Richter, A. |author2=Kuckling, D. |author3=Howitz, S. |author4=Gehring, T |author5=Arndt, K.-F. |title=Electronically controllable microvalves based on smart hydrogels: magnitudes and potential applications|journal=Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems|year=2003|volume=12|issue=5|pages=748–753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ac026455j|author= Yu, C., Mutlu, S., Selvaganapathy, P. Mastrangelo, C.H., Svec, F., Fréchet, J.M.J. |title= Flow control valves for analytical microfluidic chips without mechanical parts based on thermally responsive monolithic polymers|journal= Analytical Chemistry|year=2003|volume=75|issue=8|pages=1958–1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hydrogel Micro Valve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gesim.de/en/microfluidics/micro-valves/|title=Hydrogel Micro Valves|year=2009|publisher=GeSiM mbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides these microfluidic standard components the hydrogel platform provides also chemical sensors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3390/s8010561|author1=Richter, A. |author2=Paschew, G. |author3=Klatt, S. |author4=Lienig, J. |author5=Arndt, K.-F. |author6=Adler, H.-J. |title=Review on Hydrogel-based pH Sensors and Microsensors|journal= Sensors|year=2008|volume=8|issue=1|pages=561–581}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a novel class of microfluidic components, the chemical transistors (also referred as chemostat valves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.200601989|author1=Richter, A. |author2=Türke, A. |author3=Pich, A. |title=Controlled Double-Sensitivity of Microgels Applied to Electronically Adjustable Chemostats|journal= Advanced Materials|year=2007|volume=19|issue=8|pages=1109–1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices regulate a liquid flow if a threshold concentration of certain chemical is reached. Chemical transistors form the basis of microchemomechanical fluidic integrated circuits. "Chemical ICs" process exclusively chemical information, are energy-self-powered, operate automatically and are able for large-scale integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C2LC40617A|author= Greiner, R., Allerdißen, M., Voigt, A., Richter A.|title=Fluidic microchemomechanical integrated circuits processing chemical information|journal=Lab on a Chip|year=2012|volume=12|issue=23|pages=5034–5044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another microfluidic platform is based on [[ionomeric]] materials. Pumps made from that material could offer low voltage ([[battery (electricity)|battery]]) operation, extremely low noise signature, high system efficiency, and highly accurate control of flow rate.&lt;ref name="Electroactive Polymer Pumps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discover-technologies.com/applications.html|title=Electroactive Polymer Pumps|date=7 June 2009|publisher=Discover technologies Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another technology that can benefit from the unique properties of EAP actuators is optical membranes. Due to their low modulus, the mechanical impedance of the actuators, they are well-matched to common optical [[membrane (selective barrier)|membrane]] materials. Also, a single EAP actuator is capable of generating displacements that range from micrometers to centimeters. For this reason, these materials can be used for static shape correction and jitter suppression. These actuators could also be used to correct for [[optical aberration]]s due to atmospheric interference.&lt;ref name="Adaptive Membrane Optics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discover-technologies.com/applications.html|title=Adaptive Membrane Optics|date=7 June 2009|publisher=Discover technologies Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these materials exhibit excellent electroactive character, EAP materials show potential in [[biomimetic]]-robot research, stress sensors and [[acoustics]] field, which will make EAPs become a more attractive study topic in the near future. They have been used for various actuators such as face muscles and arm muscles in humanoid robots.&lt;ref&gt;http://eap.jpl.nasa.gov/ NASA WorldWide Electroactive Polymer Actuators Webhub&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future directions==
The field of EAPs is far from mature, which leaves several issues that still need to be worked on.&lt;ref name="ElectrochemistryEncyclopedia"/&gt; The performance and long-term stability of the EAP should be improved by designing a water [[semipermeable membrane|impermeable]] surface. This will prevent the [[evaporation]] of water contained in the EAP, and also reduce the potential loss of the positive counter ions when the EAP is operating submerged in an [[aqueous]] environment. Improved surface conductivity should be explored using methods to produce a defect-free conductive surface. This could possibly be done using metal vapor deposition or other doping methods. It may also be possible to utilize conductive polymers to form a thick conductive layer. Heat resistant EAP would be desirable to allow operation at higher voltages without damaging the internal structure of the EAP due to the generation of heat in the EAP composite. Development of EAPs in different configurations (e.g., fibers and fiber bundles), would also be beneficial, in order to increase the range of possible modes of motion.

An '''exit scam''' is a [[confidence trick]] where an established business stops shipping orders while continuing to receive payment for new orders. If the entity had a good reputation, then it can take some time before it is widely recognized that orders are not shipping, and the entity can then make off with the money paid for unshipped orders.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/darknet-slang-watch-exit-scam|title=The 'Exit Scam' Is the Darknet's Perfect Crime|work=Motherboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers that trusted the business don't realize that no orders are being fulfilled until the business has already disappeared.

Individual vendors often reach a point of reputation maturity whereby they have sold sufficient product to have accumulated both significant reputation and escrowed funds, that many may choose to exit with those funds rather than compete at the higher-volume higher-priced matured product level.&lt;ref name="reputation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janetos|first1=Nick|date=January 2017|title=Reputation Dynamics in a Market for Illicit Drugs|url=https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/sites/economics.sas.upenn.edu/files/reputation-dynamics_0.pdf|page=18|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exit scams can be a tempting alternative to a non-fraudulent shutdown of illegal operations if the operation was going to shut down anyway for other reasons. If an illegal entity thrives by selling drugs, for example, it is usually not an option for the cheated buyers to notify law enforcement.&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt; The examples mentioned in news articles are [[online]] sellers, where the buyer does not know the identity or physical location of the scammer, and therefore has little recourse.

== Examples ==
The [[darknet market|online black market]] [[Evolution (marketplace)|Evolution]] is cited as the biggest exit scam yet as of 2016. The administrators apparently made off with $12 million in [[bitcoin]], which was held in [[escrow]] on the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/evolution-downfall-insider-exit-scam-blamed-massive-drug-bazaars-sudden-disappearance-1856190|title=Evolution Downfall: Insider 'Exit Scam' Blamed For Massive Drug Bazaar's Sudden Disappearance|work=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6879">{{other uses|Flashover (disambiguation)|Electric arc}}
A '''flashover''' is the near-simultaneous ignition of most of the directly exposed [[combustible]] material in an enclosed area.  When certain organic materials are heated, they undergo [[thermal decomposition]] and release flammable gases.  Flashover occurs when the majority of the exposed surfaces in a space are heated to their [[autoignition temperature]] and emit flammable gases (see also [[flash point]]). Flashover normally occurs at {{convert|500|C}} or {{convert|1100|F|C|order=flip|sigfig=2}} for ordinary combustibles, and an incident heat flux at floor level of {{convert|20|kW/m2}}.

An example of flashover is ignition of a piece of [[furniture]] in a domestic room.  The fire involving the initial piece of furniture can produce a layer of hot [[smoke]] which spreads across the ceiling in the room. The hot buoyant smoke layer grows in depth, as it is bounded by the walls of the room. The [[thermal radiation|radiated heat]] from this layer heats the surfaces of the directly exposed combustible materials in the room, causing them to give off flammable gases via [[pyrolysis]].  When the temperatures of the evolved gases become high enough, these gases will ignite throughout their extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2010/06/kiurski-flashover.html | title=Understanding Flashover | work=Fire Engineering | date=June 22, 2010 | accessdate=September 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The original Swedish terminology related to the term 'flashover' has been altered in its translation to conform with current European and North American accepted [scientific] definitions as follows:
* A '''lean flashover''' (sometimes called '''[[rollover (fire)|rollover]]''') is the ignition of the gas layer under the ceiling, leading to total involvement of the compartment.  The fuel/air ratio is at the bottom region of the flammability range (''i.e.'' lean).
* A '''rich flashover''' occurs when the flammable gases are ignited while at the upper region of the flammability range (''i.e.'' rich). This can happen in rooms where the fire subsided because of lack of oxygen. The ignition source can be a [[smouldering]] object, or the stirring up of embers by the air track. Such an event is known as {{'}}'''[[backdraft]]'''{{'}}.
* A '''delayed flashover''' occurs when the colder gray smoke cloud ignites after congregating outside of its room of origin. This results in a volatile situation, and if the ignition occurs at the ideal mixture, the result can be a violent '''[[wiktionary:smoke explosion|smoke gas explosion]]'''. This is referred to as '''smoke explosion''' or '''fire gas ignition''' depending on the severity of the combustion process.
* A '''hot rich flashover''' occurs when the hot smoke with flammable gas ratio above the upper limit of flammability range and temperature higher than the ignition temperature leaves the compartment. Upon dilution with air it can spontaneously ignite, and the resultant flame can propagate back into the compartment, resulting in an event similar to a rich flashover. The common definition of this process is known as '''auto-ignition''' which is another form of '''fire gas ignition'''.

==Dangers==

Flashover is one of the most-feared phenomena among [[firefighter]]s. Firefighters are taught  to recognize the signs and symptoms of rollovers and flashovers and to avoid backdrafts. For example, they have certain routines for opening closed doors to buildings and compartments on fire, known as door entry procedures, ensuring fire crew safety where possible.

==Indicators==

{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2016}}

The following are some of the signs that firefighters are looking for when they attempt to determine whether a flashover is likely to occur.
* The fire is in a ventilated compartment, so there is no shortage of oxygen in the room.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* The [[Glossary of firefighting#N|neutral plane]] is moving down towards the floor. In this situation, a flashover is plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* All directly exposed combustible materials are showing signs of [[pyrolysis]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* "[[Rollover (fire)|Rollover]]" or tongues of fire appear (known as "Angel Fingers" to firefighters) as gases reach their auto-ignition temperatures.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}
* There is a rapid build-up (or "spike") in temperature due to the compound effect of rapidly burning (i.e., deflagrating) gases and the thermal cycle they produce. This is generally the best indication of a flashover.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Firefighters memorize a chant to help remember these during training: "Thick dark smoke, high heat, rollover, free burning."{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The colour of the smoke is often considered, as well, but there is no connection between the colour of the smoke and the risk of flashovers. Traditionally, black, dense smoke was considered particularly dangerous, but history shows this to be an unreliable indicator. For example, there was a fire in a [[rubber]] [[mattress]] [[factory]] in [[London]] in 1975 which produced white smoke. The white smoke wasn't considered dangerous, so firefighters decided to [[Ventilation (firefighting)|ventilate]], which caused a smoke explosion and killed two firefighters. The white smoke from the pyrolysis of the rubber turned out to be extremely flammable.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24377">'''Fly fishing tackle''' comprises the [[fishing tackle]] or equipment typically used by [[fly fishing|fly]] [[Fisherman|anglers]].  Fly fishing tackle includes:
* Fly rods - a specialized type of [[fishing rod]] designed to cast fly line and artificial flies
* Fly reels - a specialized type of [[fishing reel]] designed to hold fly line and supply [[Drag (physics)|drag]] if required to land heavy or fast fish.
* Fly line - a specialized form of [[fishing line]] that is designed to allow easy casting with a fly rod and interact with the water by either floating or sinking
* Terminal tackle not including [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]] used to connect the fly line to the artificial fly
* Accessories - [[tool]]s, [[gadget]]s, [[clothing]] and apparel used by the fly angler for maintenance and preparation of tackle, dealing the fish being caught as well as personal comfort and safety while fly fishing. Includes fly boxes used to store and carry artificial flies.

==Fly rods==

===Sizes and usage===
[[File:Fly fishing rods.JPG|alt=A variety of different brands and sizes of fly rods. |thumb|A variety of different brands and sizes of fly rods. Image courtesy of &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Waldemarpaetz}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
Fly rods normally vary between 2&amp;nbsp;m (6&amp;nbsp;ft) and 4&amp;nbsp;m (13&amp;nbsp;ft) in length with the most common length sold being 2.74 m (9&amp;nbsp;ft). Rod lengths are typically given in imperial measurements of feet and inches. Fly [[Fishing rod|rod]]s and lines are designated as to their "weight", typically written as Nwt where 'N' is the number (''e.g.'' 8wt, 9wt, 10wt).

Rods are matched to the line according to weight. The rod's manufacturer will mark on the rod the fly line weights for which a rod has been designed. One-weight (1wt) rods and lines are the lightest; the weight designations increase in whole number increments as the rod becomes heavier. The heaviest rods and lines readily available currently are 16-weight (16wt).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, ''Sage Manufacturing News Release of 16-weight 1680-4 Xi2 Saltwater Fly Rod'', 24 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In general, 1wt through 2wt rods would be used for the cast small flies for small trout and panfish; 3wt and 4wt rods are popular for small-stream fishing; 5wt is often considered the all-around rod for trout and general freshwater fishing; 6wt and 7wt rods are used on large rivers and for fishing with streamers, for larger warmwater species, and occasionally in calm inshore conditions for smaller saltwater species; 8wt to 9wt rods and lines might be used for steelhead or salmon in medium rivers, as well as for bass fishing with large flies, fishing for large carp, and general inshore saltwater use; and 10-11wt rods and lines would be used for pursuing large saltwater gamefish (tarpon, snook) under conditions of high wind or surf. The heaviest rods (12–16wt) are mostly used for bluewater species (billfish, tuna) while fishing from a boat. The characteristics of these rods reflect the fact that only short casts are needed during this type of fly fishing, while lifting ability is at a premium.

The species pursued, under which conditions, will largely determine the weight of rod selected. Next, it is important to match the line to the weight of the rod. Using too heavy a line on too light on a rod, or ''vice versa'', will dramatically affect casting performance. It may also permanently warp the rod blank. Generally speaking, you can safely go one line weight more or less (i.e. using an 8wt or 10wt line on a 9wt rod). There are also rods stamped with a range of weights. For example, a rod may be rated 7-8wt. This indicates the rod is designed for either a 7 or 8 weight fly line. There are also some rods rated for wider ranges (e.g. 8-9-10wt). The drawback to multi-rated rods is that compromises in flexibility or action are made in order to accommodate a wider range of line weights. For example, a rod rated for 8-9 weight line will be slightly stiffer than a straight 8wt but slightly softer than a straight 9wt rod. In general, the more expensive the rod, the more likely it'll be designated for a single line weight rather than a range.

Saltwater fly rods are built to handle powerful fish and to cast large, bulky flies over longer distances or into strong winds. Saltwater fly rods are normally fitted with heavier, corrosion-resistant fittings. The reel seat may also be equipped with a short extension often called a "fighting butt". Rods for saltwater fishing fall into the 8 to 15 weight class, with 12-weight being typical for most larger species like tuna, dorado (mahi-mahi) and wahoo (ono).

Note that the line weight generalities described above hold for both single-handed fly rods as well as double-handed fly rods used for [[Spey Casting]], but the length and usage of double-handed rods often varies significantly.

===Bamboo and split cane===
{{Details|Bamboo fly rods}}
The earliest fly rods were made from greenheart, a tropical wood, and later bamboo originating in the [[Tonkin]] area of [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in [[China]]. The mystical appeal of handmade split-cane rods has endured despite the emergence over the last 50 years of cheaper rod-making materials that offer more durability and performance: [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon fiber]].

Split-cane [[bamboo fly rods]] combine sport, history and art. It may take well over 100 hours for an experienced rod builder to select and split the raw cane and then to cure, flame, plane, file, taper, glue, wrap and finish each rod.  Quality rods made by famous rod makers may sell for prices well beyond [[United States dollar|US$]]2,000; a new rod from a competent, contemporary (though not famous) builder may sell for nearly as much.  These rods offer grace, form, and, with their solid mass, surprising strength.  Bamboo rods vary in action from slow to fast depending on the taper of the rod.  In competent hands, they provide the pinnacle in performance.

===Synthetic fly rods===
Today, fly rods are mainly made from [[carbon fiber]]/[[graphite]] with [[cork (material)|cork]] or, less frequently, [[hypalon]] being favored for the grip.  Such rods generally offer greater stiffness than bamboo, are much more consistent and less expensive to manufacture, and require less maintenance.  [[Fiberglass]] was popular for rods constructed in the years following [[World War II]] and was the "material of choice" for many years.  However, by the late 1980s, carbon/graphite composite rods (including premium graphite/[[boron]] and graphite/[[titanium]] blends) had emerged as the materials used by most fly rod manufacturers. These premium rods offer a stiffness, sensitivity, and feel unmatched by any other synthetic material. Graphite composites are especially well-suited to the construction of multi-piece rods since the joints, known as [[ferrule]]s, in better-quality graphite rods do not significantly affect overall flex or rod action.  Today's modern carbon graphite composite fly rods are available in a wide range of sizes and types, from ultralight trout rods to bass fishing rods and two-handed "spey" rods.

==Fly reels==
[[Image:FlyReelsAtAFlyFishingShow.jpg|thumb|left|A variety of fly reels on display at a fly fishing show]]
''Fly [[Fishing reel|reels]]'', or ''fly casting reels'', with a few exceptions, are really little more than line-storage devices.  In use, a fly angler strips line off the reel with one hand while casting and manipulating the rod with the other. Slack line is picked up by rotating the reel spool.  Even today, the vast majority of fly reels are manually operated, single-action reels of rather simple construction, with a simple click-pawl drag system. However, in recent years, more advanced fly reels have been developed for larger fish and more demanding conditions. These newer reels feature disc-type mechanical, adjustable drag systems to permit the use of lighter leaders and tippets, or to successfully capture fish that undertake long, powerful runs. Many newer fly reels have large [[Mandel|arbor]]s to increase the speed of the retrieve and to improve drag performance during long runs.  In order to prevent corrosion, saltwater fly reels often use aluminum frames and spools or stainless steel components with sealed bearing and drive mechanisms.

Some reels with simple click drags are designed to be "[[Hand|palm]]ed" when a fish runs with the line. Palming allows the angler to add additional drag with a light touch of the palm to the rim of the reel. On some reels, palming is difficult or impossible because the spool is fully skirted. With such reels, the only drag that an angler can apply to the line is with one or more fingers directly pinching the line.

The fly line can be retrieved using either hand. Most modern fly reels can be converted to or from left-hand or right-hand retrieve. Many fly anglers who have come to the sport after spending some years as spin casting anglers are more comfortable with a left-hand retrieve. Right-handed "big game" fishers may find the right hand retrieve more efficient. In either case, modern large-arbor reels can be retrieved with fair efficiency using either hand to retrieve.

Fly reels are often rated for a specific weight and type of fly line in combination with a specific strength and length of backing. For example, the documentation supplied with a reel may state that the reel can take {{convert|150|yd}} of 50&amp;nbsp;pound-test backing and {{convert|30|yd}} of fly line. An angler should be able to "load" the reel with the specified length of line and backing and still have sufficient room between the line and the spool's edge. As well, many modern reels are designed to take interchangeable spools. Such spools can be quickly switched, thus allowing an angler to change the type of line in a matter of minutes.

==Fly lines==
Fly line is a specialized fishing line that supplies the weight or mass necessary to cast an artificial fly with a fly rod.  The first fly lines were constructed of woven horsehair that eventually evolved into woven silk fiber lines.  As plastics technologies improved, synthetic materials gradually replaced natural materials in the construction of fly lines.  Today’s fly lines are generally constructed of an outside synthetic layer that determines the line’s slickness, buoyancy, shape and weight over an inside core material which determines the line’s strength and flexibility.  The typical fly line is {{convert|90|ft|m}} long although longer fly lines are manufactured. Fly lines have several characteristics which can be used to describe any given fly line.  Some of these characteristics are based on industry standards and norms while others vary considerably between manufacturers.
*'''Taper''' – Taper describes the change in cross-sectional diameter of a fly line from one end to another.  Taper is a significant determinant in the casting performance of an individual fly line particularly the ability to present different types of artificial flies from the very delicate to the heavy and wind resistant in differing on-water conditions. Fly lines in general are said to be:
**'''Weight forward taper''' – the cross-sectional diameter changes from smaller to larger to small within the front {{convert|30|ft|m}} of the fly line.  Weight forward taper lines have only one end to which the leader is attached.
**'''Double taper''' – the cross-sectional diameter changes from smaller to larger to smaller symmetrically along the entire length of the fly line.  Double taper fly lines may be reversed by the angler with the leader being attached to either end of the line.
**'''Level''' – the cross-sectional diameter is identical along the entire length of the fly line.
**'''Shooting heads''' –Shooting heads and tips are level or tapered sections of fly line designed for exceptionally long distance casting.
*'''Weight''' – Fly line weight is an industry standard measure of the actual weight in grains of the first {{convert|30|ft|m}} or 9.1 meters of fly line.  Fly rods are designed to cast fly lines of a specific weight.  Fly line weights vary from 1 weight to 15 weight using standards established by the [[American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers Association]].  A 5 weight fly line is designed to match up with a 5 weight fly rod. These relationships are not absolute and anglers may prefer to over-line or under-line any given rod depending on their casting style and rod action. Some sinking and sink-tip fly lines do not carry a numbered weight, but instead are identified by the actual weight in grains of the first {{convert|30|ft|m}} of line, such as a {{convert|250|gr|sing=on}} sinking line.

*'''Buoyancy''' – Typical fly lines have a buoyancy characteristic that describes how the line behaves on the water after being cast.
**'''Floating''' – Floating fly line is designed to float on the surface of the water along its entire length.  Floating fly line is essential for presentation of artificial flies that must remain on the surface such as dry flies, poppers, bugs, etc.  Floating fly line is also necessary to fish nymphs effectively with strike indicators.
**'''Sink-Tip''' – Sink Tip fly line is designed so that some length of the tip section of the fly line sinks while the remainder of the fly line floats.  Sink Tips are generally characterized by a sink rate in inches per seconds and are used when it is necessary to get artificial flies deeper in the water column.
**'''Sinking''' – Sinking fly line is designed to sink along the entire length of fly line and is typically used in fly fishing deep waters or where the artificial fly must reach the bottom of the water column rapidly.
Fly line manufacturers design and formulate their fly lines with other characteristics as well.  Some fly lines are specifically formulated for warm water and cold water conditions, fresh and salt water conditions as well as designs that target a specific type or fish or fishing.

===Backing===
Fly line is typically attached to a length of braided or gelspun line wound on the fly reel known as backing.  The length and breaking strength of the backing required depends on the overall line capacity of the reel and the type of fish being sought.  Backing may be as short as a few yards up to hundreds of yards if the reel has the capacity. Backing can serve two purposes.  One is to create a larger diameter spooling surface that allows the fly line to fill the entire fly reel.  The other is to provide additional line for fighting heavy or hard fighting fish.  A fast running or hard fighting fish may take line from the reel and get ''into the backing.''

== Terminal tackle ==

Terminal fly fishing tackle connects the fly line to the artificial fly.  This is typically a tapered or level ‘’leader’’ with a ‘’tippet’’ section.  Other terminal tackle may include small ‘’strike indicators’’ or weights added to the leader to assist in strike detection and presentation. The leader is a section of fishing line that is attached directly to the end of the fly line.  The ‘’tippet’’ section is a section of fishing line attached to the leader to which the artificial fly is attached.  Leaders and tippets play a key role in the presentations of the fly to the fish and the subsequent landing of a fish when caught.  Leaders and tippets are generally constructed of [[Monofilament fishing line|monofilament]] or [[fluorocarbon]] fishing line.  In some fly fishing situations involving toothy fish, tippets are constructed of braided or single strand stainless steel wire.

===Tapered leaders===
The tip of a fly line is usually more than 0.030" thick and the eye of a fly hook
may be less than a tenth that size.   The two must be joined by a "leader," usually 7 to 10 feet long, nowadays of nylon or similar monofilament, either extruded in a continuous taper or made by knotting together several lengths of nylon of diminishing thickness.  These taper from about 0.020" diameter to 0.010" for a large fly or 0.007" for a size 14 trout fly.  The right size and stiffness of nylon also helps the leader "turn over" when cast, so as to present the fly naturally, as if not connected with a fishing rod.  Anglers usually carry spools of extra fine nylon, to replace the tippet or other sections of a leader as required.

===Level leaders and sink tips===
Level leaders are a single diameter of line that connects the fly line to the tippet or fly.  Level leaders are typically much shorter than tapered leaders and used with sinking fly lines and heavy flies.  Level leaders when used with sinking lines help get the fly deeper faster.

===Tippets===
The tippet connects the leader to the fly.  Tippet sizes were traditionally expressed as ''X'' sizes in a scale based on silkworm gut leader material, but nowadays gut has been superseded by a variety of synthetics, mainly monofilaments.  Monofilament is calibrated in thousandths of an inch from 0.020" and larger (used for leader butts or in saltwater fishing) to 0.011" (old size 0X) and as small as 0.003" (8X.)   Fly fishing records are classed by tippet diameter, not breaking strength, which varies between material and manufacturers. Choice of tippet involves a tradeoff: finer tippets are less visible to the fish, resulting in more strikes, but are more easily abraded and broken. Stiffer or softer tippets may be used depending on water temperature, visibility, and need for abrasion resistance. Some toothy species require specially strong and durable tippets so they will not be bitten through, called ''shock tippets,'' made of thick monofilament or stainless steel wire.

=== Strike indicators and leader weight ===
* Strike indicators – Small floating cork, yarn, or foam devices attached to the leader at some point (typically 12” – 48”) above the fly to assist in the detection of strikes while fly fishing with nymphs or other wet flies.
* Leader weight – Small amounts of [[lead]] or [[tungsten]] shot, putty or ribbon are applied to a leader fly to sink the fly to the proper depth.  Leader weight may be used in combination with strike indicators while fishing nymphs.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbauer, Tom, ''The Orvis Fly Fishing Guide,'' The Lyons Press, Connecticut,&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accessories ==

Accessories include an abundance of different tools and gadgets used by fly anglers to maintain and prepare their tackle, deal with fish being caught and personal [[clothing]] and [[apparel]] specifically designed for fly fishing comfort and safety.  Accessories include fly boxes designed to store and carry artificial flies.

=== Tools and Gadgets ===

* Floatant - A [[liquid]], paste or dry agent typically applied to artificial flies in dry fly fishing. Floatants prevent waterlogging or [[desiccate]] waterlogged flies.
* Wetting Agent - A liquid design to cause the sinking of flies and leaders.
* [[Knot]] tying tools - Tools used to assist in the tying of fly fishing knots to include the knotting of flies to tippets.
* Tippet holder - A mechanism to hold one or more small spools of tippet material used in fly fishing leaders. Fly anglers typically carry a variety of tippet sizes at one time.
* Nippers - A small clipping tool used to cut tippet material and other fishing lines cleanly.
* [[Hemostat]]s - Used to remove hooks from the mouths of fish and other clamping tasks.
* [[Pliers]] - Used for a variety of tasks—safely remove hooks, tighten knots, crimp sleeves, cut leaders and line and connect wires.
* Jaw grippers - Used to handle and control larger fish safety by their lower lip, and to maintain a safe distance from sharp teeth.
* [[Thermometer]] - Fly anglers use thermometers to determine the water temperature of the water they are fishing.
* Landing net - A handheld net used to assist in the landing of fish caught by the fly angler.  Landing nets are typically constructed of cord or rubber mesh and facilitate [[catch and release]] angling.
* [[Lanyards]] - Lanyards are used to hold a variety of tools and gadget around the angler's neck, or to tether gear to the angler to avoid loss.
* Retractable gear keepers - used to organize individual tools and gadgets while keeping them accessible on the water without risk of loss
* Hook sharpeners - Sharpening steels are used to sharpen [[fish hook]]s while on the water.
* Fly patches - Fly patches are made of pieces of wool or foam to hold flies while they dry.
* [[Magnify|Magnifiers]] - Used to assist threading fine tippets and tying on small flies on the water.
* [[Flashlight]] / Headlamp - Many anglers fish before sunrise or after dark, so artificial lights are used to tie knots and navigate.
* Wading [[Walking stick|staff]] - Some anglers carry sticks or purpose-made collapsible wading staffs to provide support while wading among slippery rocks in fast-flowing rivers.

===Clothing and Apparel===
* Fishing [[gloves]] - Fly anglers use a variety of gloves to protect their hands from the cold, the sun and from damage by handling toothy fish.
* Fishing hats - Fly anglers often wear brimmed hats for sun protection, to provide shade to aid spotting fishing in the water, to advertise, to store flies, and to mount magnifying glasses and/or headlamps
* Fishing neckgear - Saltwater anglers frequently wear purpose-made quick-dry fabric sleeves as sun protection for the head, neck and face
* Stripping guards - Prevents grooves and cuts on your stripping finger.
* Fishing packs - There are a wide variety of small to large packs specifically designed for fly anglers that are used to carry accessories, supplies and other gear while on the water.  These include [[fanny pack]]s, [[backpacks]] and chest packs.
* Fishing [[vest]]s - There are a wide variety of vests specifically designed for fly anglers that are used to carry accessories, supplies and other gear while on the water.
* [[Waders (footwear)|Waders]] -  Waders are used to keep anglers dry while wading or otherwise in contact with water such as kayaking.  Waders may be chest high, hip high, or merely tall boots.  Waders may be ''stocking foot'' requiring the use of a wading boot or shoe or have integrated boot feet. Contemporary waders are either made of breathable [[Gore-Tex]] or [[neoprene]].  Waders also provide some [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] against cold temperatures.
* Wading [[boots]] - Wading boots provide protection for the angler's feet and typically have some form of gripping mechanism on the sole to provide a margin of safety on slippery surfaces.  This mechanism may be made of felt, felt with metal studs, sticky rubber lugs, or synthetic felts. Boots made for saltwater wading may have stiff soles to avoid puncture by coral and provide support for long wades across shallow flats.
* [[Personal flotation device]]s - Some fly anglers wear PFDs when fishing in dangerous waters or where required by law.
* [[Polarization (waves)|Polarized]] [[sunglasses]] - Protects angler's eyes from the sun's rays and provides better underwater visibility while fishing.

===Fly boxes===
[[Image:AssortedFlyBoxes.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of fly boxes with trout, warmwater and saltwater flies]]
Fly boxes are designed to store and carry artificial flies in an organized manner.  The typical fly angler carries one or more fly boxes while fly fishing. Fly boxes are available in a wide variety of sizes, styles and configurations.  Fly boxes store flies using a variety of foam, plastic, clip, metal and containing mechanisms. Probably the most famous fly boxes are made in England by Richard Wheatley who have been manufacturing these since 1860 and maybe the oldest continuous makers of fly fishing tackle in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2754">'''Football Live''' was the name given to the project and computer system created and utilised by [[PA Sport]] to collect Real Time Statistics from major English &amp; Scottish Football Matches and distribute to most leading media organisations. At the time of its operation, more than 99% of all football statistics displayed across Print, Internet, Radio &amp; TV Media outlets would have been collected via Football Live.

==Background==
Prior to implementation of Football Live, the collection process consisted of a news reporter or press officer at each club calling the Press Association, relaying information on Teams, Goals and Half-Time &amp; Full Time.

The basis for Football Live was to have a representative of the Press Association (FBA - Football Analyst) at every ground. Throughout the whole match they would stay on an open line on a mobile phone, constantly relaying in real time statistical information for every :
* Shot
* Foul
* Free Kick
* Goal
* Cross
* Goal Kick
* Offside

This information would be entered in real time and passed to our media customers.

The Football Live project was in use from Season 2001/02 until the service was taken over by Opta in 2013/14

==Commercial Customers==
The most famous use for the Football Live data was for the [[Vidiprinter]] services on BBC &amp; Sky Sports, allowing goals to be viewed on TV screens within 20 seconds of the event happening.

==League competitions==
From its inception in 2001/02 season, the following leagues/competitions were fully covered by Football live
* English Premier League
* Championship
* League One
* League Two
* Conference
* Scottish Premier League
* English FA Cup
* English Football League Cup

==Football Analysts==
During the early development stages, the initial idea was to employee ex-referees to act as Football Analysts, but this was soon dismissed in favour of  ex-professional Footballers. The most famous of which were [[Brendan Ormsby|Brendon Ormsby]], [[Mel Sterland]], [[Jimmy Case]], [[Imre Varadi]]. All the FBA's were supplied and managed by the Professional Football Association (PFA), with day-to-day responsibility lying with [[Paul Allen (footballer)|Paul Allen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepfa.com/thepfa/staff/StaffPopup?guid=8a43a122-21d8-4145-86f0-e75f92505d80|title=The PFAStaff Profiles - About the PFA|website=www.thepfa.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chris Joslin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thepfa.com/thepfa/commercial/staff/StaffPopup?guid=06ed6e05-6a8e-44b6-bd07-b8cc9ea95e67|title=The PFAStaff Profiles - Commercial - About the PFA|website=www.thepfa.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the PFA.

A '''general-purpose input/output''' ('''GPIO''') is an uncommitted digital signal pin on an [[integrated circuit]] or electronic circuit board whose behavior—including whether it acts an input or output—is controllable by the user at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].

GPIOs have no predefined purpose and are unused by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Raspberry Pi - The Complete Manual|last=|first=|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1785463709|editor-last=White|editor-first=Jon|edition=7|location=|pages=36|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javame/8.0/me-dev-guide/toc.htm|title=Oracle® Java ME Embedded Developer's Guide|last=|first=|publisher=[[Oracle Corporation]]|year=2014|isbn=|edition=8|location=|pages=|chapter=General Purpose Input/Output|quote=|chapter-url=https://docs.oracle.com/javame/8.0/me-dev-guide/gpio.htm|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If used, the purpose and behavior of a GPIO is defined and implemented by the designer of higher assembly-level circuitry: the circuit board designer in the case of integrated circuit GPIOs, or system integrator in the case of board-level GPIOs.

==Integrated circuit GPIOs==

Integrated circuit (IC) GPIOs are implemented in a variety of ways. Some ICs provide GPIOs as a primary function whereas others include GPIOs as a convenient "accessory" to some other primary function. Examples of the former include the [[Intel 8255]], which interfaces 24 GPIOs to a parallel bus, and various GPIO "expander" ICs, which interface GPIOs to serial buses such as [[I²C]] and [[SMBus]]. An example of the latter is the [[Realtek]] ALC260 IC, which provides eight GPIOs in addition to its primary function of [[audio codec]].

[[Microcontroller]] ICs typically include GPIOs. Depending on the application, a microcontroller's GPIOs may comprise its primary interface to external circuitry or they may be just one type of I/O used among several, such as analog I/O, counter/timer, and serial communication.

In some ICs, particularly microcontrollers, a GPIO pin may be capable of alternate functions. Often in such cases, it is necessary to configure the pin to operate as a GPIO (vs. its alternate functions) in addition to configuring the GPIO's behavior. Some microcontroller devices (e.g., Microchip dsPIC33 family) incorporate internal signal routing circuitry that allows GPIOs to be programmatically mapped to device pins. [[FPGA]]s extend this capability by allowing GPIO pin mapping, instantiation and architecture to be programmatically controlled.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Board-level GPIOs==

Many circuit boards expose board-level GPIOs to external circuitry through integrated electrical connectors. Typically, each such GPIO is accessible via a dedicated connector pin.

Like IC-based GPIOs, some boards merely include GPIOs as a convenient, auxiliary resource that augments the board's primary function, whereas in other boards the GPIOs are the central, primary function of the board. Some boards, which typically are classified as multi-function I/O boards, are a combination of both; such boards provide GPIOs along with other types of general-purpose I/O. GPIOs are also found on embedded controller boards such as [[Arduino]], [[BeagleBone]] and [[Raspberry Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/gpio/README.md|title=GPIO - Raspberry Pi Documentation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Board-level GPIOs are often endowed with capabilities which typically are not found in IC-based GPIOs. For example, [[schmitt-trigger]] inputs, high-current output drivers, [[optical isolator]]s, or combinations of these may be used to buffer and condition the GPIO signals and to protect board circuitry. Also, higher-level functions are sometimes implemented, such as input [[debounce]], input [[signal edge]] detection, and [[pulse-width modulation]] (PWM) output.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Usage==
GPIOs are used in a diverse variety of applications, limited only by the electrical and timing specifications of the GPIO interface and the ability of software to interact with GPIOs in a sufficiently timely manner.

GPIOs typically employ standard logic levels and cannot supply significant current to output loads. When followed by an appropriate high-current output buffer (or mechanical or solid-state relay), a GPIO may be used to control high-power devices such as lights, solenoids, heaters, and motors (e.g., fans and blowers). Similarly, an input buffer, relay or optoisolator is often used to translate an otherwise incompatible signal (e.g., high voltage) to the logic levels required by a GPIO.

Integrated circuit GPIOs are commonly used to control or monitor other circuitry (including other ICs) on a board. Examples of this include enabling and disabling the operation of (or power to) other circuitry, reading the states of on-board switches and configuration shunts, and driving [[LED]] status indicators. In the latter case, a GPIO can, in many cases, supply enough output current to directly power an LED without using an intermediate buffer.

Multiple GPIOs are sometimes used together as a [[bit banging|bit-banged]] communication interface. For example, two GPIOs may be used to implement a serial communication bus such as [[I²C]], and four GPIOs can be used to implement an [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus; these are typically used to facilitate serial communication with ICs and other devices which have compatible serial interfaces, such as sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, pressure sensors, [[accelerometer]]s) and motor controllers. Taken to the extreme, this technique may be used to implement an entire parallel bus, thus allowing communication with bus-oriented ICs or circuit boards.

Although GPIOs are fundamentally digital in nature, they are often used to control linear processes. For example, a GPIO may be used to control motor speed, light intensity, or temperature. Typically, this is accomplished via PWM, in which the duty cycle of the GPIO output signal determines the effective magnitude of the process control signal. For example, when controlling light intensity, the light may be dimmed by reducing the GPIO duty cycle. Some linear processes require a linear control voltage; in such cases it may be feasible to connect a GPIO -- which is operated as a PWM output -- to an RC filter to create a simple and inexpensive [[digital-to-analog converter]].

==Implementation==

GPIO interfaces vary widely. In some cases, they are simple—a group of pins that can switch as a group to either input or output. In others, each pin can be set up to accept or source different logic voltages, with configurable drive strengths and [[Pull-up resistor|pull ups/downs]]. Input and output voltages are typically—though not always—limited to the supply voltage of the device with the GPIOs, and may be damaged by greater voltages.

A GPIO pin's state may be exposed to the software developer through one of a number of different interfaces, such as a [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory mapped]] peripheral, or through dedicated IO port instructions. Some GPIOs have 5&amp;nbsp;V tolerant inputs: even when the device has a low supply voltage (such as 2&amp;nbsp;V), the device can accept 5&amp;nbsp;V without damage.

A GPIO port is a group of GPIO pins (typically 8 GPIO pins) arranged in a group and controlled as a group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

GPIO capabilities may include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Energy for normal operations at the data center parks is used exclusively from renewable sources, in Germany from [[hydropower]] and in Finland from [[wind power]]. In the German data center parks, this energy is provided by Energiedienst AG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2017-11-21}} |title=Zertifikat verliehen an Hetzner Online AG "Certificate presented to Hetzner Online AG" |publisher=Hetzner Online GmbH |url=https://www.hetzner.de/assets/Uploads/downloads/oekostrom-zertifikat.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2017-11-21}} |title=Hetzner Online is taking responsibility and protecting the environment |publisher=Hetzner Online GmbH |url=https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/umweltschutz/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the company strives to conserver energy with its use of direct free cooling, double-height [[raised floor]], components selected on the basis of energy-consumption, waste heat recycling, and intelligent lighting solutions. In 2011, [[TÜV SÜD]] certified Hetzner's data centers as an "Energy Efficient Enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2011-07-01}} |title=TÜV SÜD awarded the 'Energy Efficient Enterprise – Data Centre' certificate to Hetzner Online's data centre park |publisher=TÜV SÜD |url=http://www.tuev-sued.de/plants-buildings-technical-facilities/focal-topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-enterprise/case-study-online-datacenter-park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent possible faults caused by problems with the electrical network, Hetzner Online obtains its power in a redundant manner from the network provider. The current is fed from the neighbouring transformer station to the redundant transformers via two separate lines. The A/B busbar concept, in conjunction with the use of static transfer switches (STS), ensures a higher availability of the power supply. The redundant modular UPS system is able to secure the complete power supply in case of a module failure. In the event of a longer power failure, a diesel generator takes over the entire power supply of the data center. In addition, a battery monitoring system permanently monitors the condition of the battery blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2017-11-21}} |title=Secure Power Supply |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS-KxG5ozec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooling system===

Direct free cooling is used for cooling IT hardware. In contrast to conventional systems, this method uses outside air for cooling. If the outdoor temperature rises, the system automatically switches to mixed operation and cools the air via compressors. The cold air is then directed to the air intakes of the servers via the raised floors. This is made possible by cold aisle containment, in which the currents of cold and warm air are separated and deliberately channeled in specific directions. The warm air in the corridors and near the ceiling of the data center are channeled out through the roof in a concentrated manner. The remaining "waste heat" is not wasted. In fact, it is used to heat offices. This system, which was designed in house, not only effecitvely cools the hardware; it also reduces the use of cold air and increases the efficiency of cooling, thereby reducing energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2017-11-21}} |title=Efficient Cooling |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pwa2X-krMQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network===

The backbone is set up in the form of a ring network between the datacenter locations Nuremberg and Falkenstein as well as the most important Internet location, Frankfurt. All locations are connected to central exchange nodes such as DE-CIX, AMS-IX, DATA-IX and V-IX via the company's own fiber optic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2017-11-21}} |title=Secure Modern Network Infrastructure |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLyQcpXDci4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Efficiency Monitoring System===

An extensive array of measuring devices enables the Hetzner Online team to closely monitor energy consumption and analyze the quality of the power network in real time. The system measures power consumption 24/7 at different intervals at all levels in the data center and sends warnings if it finds of anomalies. A remote-readable software calculates important key figures, such as PUE/EER, and identifies optimization potentials.

===Certification===
The internationally recognized standard for information security certifies that Hetzner Online GmbH has established and implemented an appropriate information security management system (ISMS). Hetzner Online utilizes the ISMS in its infrastructure and complete operations for the data center parks in the Nuremberg and Falkenstein locations. FOX Certification, a third party certification authority, audited Hetzner Online's data center parks for the certification process. The datacenter parks are thus certified in accordance to [[ISO/IEC 27001]].

This certification confirms that Hetzner Online will uphold strict information security standards. It states that Hetzner Online provides up-to-standard systems for security management, data security, data confidentiality and availability of IT systems. The certificate proves adequate security management, data security, confidentiality of information and availability of IT systems. It also confirms that the safety standards are continuously improved and sustainably monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2017-11-21}} |title=Establishing trust through security |url=https://www.hetzner.com/assets/Uploads/downloads/Sicherheit-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2017-11-21}} |title=Fox certification |url=https://www.hetzner.com/assets/Uploads/downloads/FOX-Zertifikat-en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity==
Hetzner Online is a sponsor of a variety of humanitarian and educational charity organizations. Sponsoring activities in the past include [[Habitat for Humanity]] Germany and their building projects in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.habitat.org/where-we-build/germany/ Habitat for Humanity Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Hetzner Online donated setup fees received from new orders during the football [[World Cup 2010]] to the Youth Build Project 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Zeleni Hosting |date={{date|2012-01-10}} |title=Cheque for 148.000 Euro to welfare organisation |publisher=Zeleni Hosting |url=http://www.zelenihosting.com/en/blog/cheque-for-148-000-euro-to-welfare-organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Habitat for Humanity Germany patron, actress [[Alexandra Neldel]] travelled to [[Mozambique]] and [[South Africa]] to learn more about Hetzner Online's projects. The company received the Habitat for Humanity Corporate Partnership Award in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfhd.de/auszeichnung_hetzner_ag.html Hetzner Online AG erhält Auszeichnung für beispielhaftes soziales Engagement]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Hetzner Online has sponsored several non-profit organizations located in the communities near its data center parks.

==Incidents==

===Hacking===

In June 2013, Hetzner Online suffered from a security breach where customer information was exposed to attackers who had compromised Hetzner Online's monitoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Fabian Scherschel |date={{date|2013-06-07}} |title=Hetzner web hosting service hacked, customer data copied |publisher=[[The H]] |url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Hetzner-web-hosting-service-hacked-customer-data-copied-1884574.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nicole Henderson |date={{date|2013-06-07}} |title=Hetzner Security Breach Exposes Customer Passwords, Payment Information |publisher=Web Host Industry Review |url=http://www.thewhir.com/web-hosting-news/hetzner-security-breach-exposes-customer-passwords-payment-information }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian complaints about Glavcom.ua===

In early August 2014, the Russian [[Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media]] (Roskomnadzor) sent a demand to many news agencies, including [[BBC]], prohibiting any mention of the demonstration that was being arranged in the Siberian city of [[Novosibirsk]] in support of the federalization of Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/blogs/2014/08/140802_blog_editor_restricting_access.shtml BBC: "Блог редактора: Артем Лоскутов и "федерализация Сибири"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/statements/artem-loskutov BBC World Service statement regarding interview with Artem Loskutov]&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of such messages were sent to Ukraine, which was in the midst of [[War in Donbass|undeclared war with Russian paramilitary in Donetsk region]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-12/ukraine-rebels-seek-to-join-russia-as-gas-deadline-set.html Bloomberg: Ukraine in ‘Undeclared War’ With Russia as Rebels Unite]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Ukrainian online newspapers did not remove the article, Roskomnadzor sent letters to their Internet providers demanding removal of the news item. Hetzner Online complied with the demands and sent a notice to glavcom.ua, saying "Please solve the problem and reply within the next 24 hours to avoid suspension. This is the final deadline."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ain.ua/2014/08/06/535747 Немцы заблокируют «Главком» за то, что он не удалил статью по требованию Роскомнадзора]&lt;/ref&gt;

This story was widely reprinted in news sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/webhoster-hetzner-fordert-zensur-von-ukrainischer-website-glavcom-a-985147.html Webhoster Hetzner: Deutsche Firma hilft russischer Medienaufsicht bei Zensur]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
issued a statement expressing solidarity with glavcom.ua owners and journalists. 
Vassily Zvarych, vice-head of Communications Department of Foreign Ministry, gave a press conference saying that he was surprised by Hetzner Online's compliance with the Russian complaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linenews.com.ua/?p=2888 МИД Украины удивлен позицией немецкого хостера, согласившегося с Роскомнадзором]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a German chapter of [[Reporters Without Borders]] issued a statement condemning Roskomnadzor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reporter-ohne-grenzen.de/pressemitteilungen/meldung/russische-zensurversuche-im-ausland/ Russische Zensurversuche im Ausland]&lt;/ref&gt;

The notices to suspend Glavcom.ua were issued by Hetzner Online August 6, 2014; on August 10 Hetzner Online issued apologies, denying that any censorship was planned and that their technical support made a wrong decision, which they regret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1407702463 Human rights in Ukraine: Russian censor will not be allowed to block Glavkom]&lt;/ref&gt; However, by that time the story was widely published in German mass-media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date={{date|2014-08-09}} |title=The Truth About Hetzner Censoring Glavcom |publisher=root-services.net |url=https://r00t-services.net/knowledgebase/39/The-Truth-About-Hetzner-Censoring-Glavcom.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Glavcom.ua already migrated from Hetzner Online to another hosting provider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rublacklist.net/8195/ Роскомсвобода: Немецкий хостер хотел заблокировать украинский сайт по требованию Роскомнадзора, но извинился]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://glavcom.ua/news/225722.html Glavcom.ua: Немецкий хостер отказался блокировать «Главком» и извинился перед редакцией]&lt;/ref&gt;

===no.spam.ee lawsuit===

In 2013, an [[Estonia]]n anti-[[email spam|spam]] activist [[Tõnu Samuel]] posted a blog entry about an alleged spammer Silver Teede on his website no.spam.ee. In retaliation, Teede wrote a complaint to the blog's service provider, Hetzner Online, who decided to terminate services for the blog. In an ensuing court case, Estonian courts found the complaints to be baseless and awarded Samuel [[damages]] for the loss of his servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hans Lõugas |date={{date|2013-10-29}} |title=Laimaja peab sotsiaalmeedias vabandust paluma |publisher=[[Eesti Päevaleht]] |url=http://epl.delfi.ee/news/eesti/laimaja-peab-sotsiaalmeedias-vabandust-paluma.d?id=66992046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sander Silm |date={{date|2013-10-28}} |title=Netilaimaja peab maksma Tõnu Samuelile 11 150 eurot |publisher=[[Õhtuleht]] |url=http://www.ohtuleht.ee/551502/netilaimaja-peab-maksma-tonu-samuelile-11-150-eurot }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Silver Meikar |date={{date|2013-06-17}} |title=Silver Meikar: avatus ja läbipaistvus taastaks usalduse |publisher=[[Postimees]] |url=http://arvamus.postimees.ee/1272534/silver-meikar-avatus-ja-labipaistvus-taastaks-usalduse }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===blocking "Novaya Gazeta"===
On January 11, 2016, Hetzner blocked the [[St. Petersburg]] site of [[Novaya Gazeta]], the leading oppositional, non-governmental newspaper in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fontanka.ru/2016/01/11/182/ Немецкий провайдер заблокировал сайт «Новой газеты в Петербурге»]&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper marked the act as political censorship without any legal procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://novayagazeta.spb.ru/ Осторожно, цензура!]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[petroleum industry]]''' is not of recent origin, but [[petroleum]]'s current status as the key component of politics, society, and technology has its roots in the early 20th century. The invention of the [[internal combustion engine]] was the major influence in the rise in the importance of petroleum.

==Early history==

According to [[Herodotus]], more than four thousand years ago natural asphalt was employed in the construction of the walls and towers of [[Babylon]], great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river [[Issus (river)|Issus]], one of the tributaries of the [[Euphrates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/herodwill01hero|title=Herodotus|last=Herodotus|last2=Beloe|first2=William|date=1830|publisher=London : H. Colburn and R. Bentley|others=University of California Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and this fact confirmed by [[Diodorus Siculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/DiodorosOfSicily034.598|title=Diodoros of Sicily (Diodorus Siculus), Library of History (Loeb Classical Library in 10 volumes)|last=C. H. Oldfather|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herodotus]] mentioned pitch spring on [[Zacynthus]] ([[Ionian islands]], Greece).&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt; Also, [[Herodotus]] described a well for bitumen and oil near [[Ardericca in Susiana|Ardericca]] in [[Cissia (area)|Cessia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/herodotus03hero|title=Herodotus|last=Herodotus|last2=Beloe|first2=William|date=1806|publisher=London : Leigh and S. Southeby|others=University of California Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] tablets indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

Oil was exploited in the Roman province of [[Dacia]], now in [[Romania]], where it was called ''picula''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The use of petroleum dates back to ancient China more than 2000 years ago. In [[I Ching]], one of the earliest Chinese writings cites the use of oil in its raw state without refining was first discovered, extracted, and used in China in the first century BCE.

By the 10th century, extensive [[bamboo]] pipelines connected oil wells with salt springs.  The ancient records of China and Japan are said to contain many allusions to the use of natural gas for lighting and heating.  Petroleum was known as ''burning water'' in Japan in the 7th century.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petroleum|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' written in 1088, the polymathic scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] of the [[Song Dynasty]] coined the word 石油 (''Shíyóu'', literally "rock oil") for petroleum, which remains the term used in contemporary Chinese and Japanese (''Sekiyū'').

The first streets of [[Baghdad]] were paved with [[tar]], derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region. In the 9th century, [[oil field]]s were exploited in the area around modern [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]. These fields were described by the [[Islamic geography|Arab geographer]] [[Abu al-Hasan 'Alī al-Mas'ūdī]] in the 10th century, and by [[Marco Polo]] in the 13th century, who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads.

In 1745 under the Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] the first oil well and refinery were built in [[Ukhta]] by Fiodor Priadunov. Through the process of distillation of the "rock oil" ([[petroleum]]) he received a kerosene-like substance, which was used in oil lamps by Russian churches and monasteries (though households still relied on candles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nepsite.com/node/5944 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714163353/http://www.nepsite.com/node/5944 |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oilfields California.jpg|thumb|Oil field in [[California]], 1938.]]
The [[modern world|modern history]] of petroleum began in the 19th century with the refining of [[Kerosene|paraffin]] from crude oil. The Scottish chemist [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] in 1847 noticed a natural [[petroleum]] seepage in the [[Riddings]] [[colliery]] at [[Alfreton]], [[Derbyshire]] from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery.
In 1846, Baku (settlement Bibi-Heybat) the first ever well drilled with percussion tools to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration, based on data of Nicolay Voskoboynikov; it was 13 years before the Drake's well was drilled in Pennsylvania. 
The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the [[sandstone]] roof of the coal mine, theorized that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.

Following up this idea, he tried many experiments and eventually succeeded, by distilling [[cannel coal]] at a low heat, a fluid resembling [[petroleum]], which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named "paraffine oil" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell | first = Loris S. | title = A Heritage of Light: Lamps and Lighting in the Early Canadian Home | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8020-3765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of these oils and solid [[paraffin wax]] from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young &amp; Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney &amp; Co. at [[Bathgate]] in [[West Lothian]] and E. Meldrum &amp; Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined [[torbanite]], shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture [[naphtha]] and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.

[[Abraham Pineo Gesner]], a Canadian geologist developed a process to refine a liquid fuel from coal, bitumen and oil shale. His new discovery, which he named kerosene, burned more cleanly and was less expensive than competing products, such as whale oil. In 1850, Gesner created the Kerosene Gaslight Company and began installing lighting in the streets in Halifax and other cities. By 1854, he had expanded to the United States where he created the North American Kerosene Gas Light Company at Long Island, New York. Demand grew to where his company’s capacity to produce became a problem, but the discovery of petroleum, from which kerosene could be more easily produced, solved the supply problem.

In 1846 the first oil well in the world was drilled in Asia, on the Aspheron Peninsula north-east of Baku (in settlement Bibi-Heybat), by Major Alekseev based on data of N. Voskoboynikov.&lt;ref name="The History of the Oil Industry"&gt;[http://www.sjvgeology.org/history/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available "rock oil" ("petr-oleum") [[Petroleum seep|seep]]s, in 1852, and the first rock oil mine was built in [[Bóbrka, Krosno County|Bóbrka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|central European Galicia]] ([[Poland]]) in 1854. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world, and [[Meerzoeff]] built the first modern Russian [[Oil refinery|refinery]] in the mature oil fields at [[Baku]] in 1861. At that time Baku produced about 90% of the world's oil.

The question of what constituted the first commercial oil well is a difficult one to answer. [[Edwin Drake]]'s 1859 well near [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]], discussed more fully below, is popularly considered the first modern well.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11368/ |title = Titusville, Pennsylvania, 1896 |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1896 |accessdate = 2013-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drake's well is probably singled out because it was drilled, not dug; because it used a steam engine; because there was a company associated with it; and because it touched off a major boom. However, the first well ever drilled anywhere in the world, which produced oil, was drilled in 1857 to a depth of 280 feet by the American Merrimac Company in La Brea (Spanish for “Pitch”) in southeast Trinidad in the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Down A L “History of Trinidad’s Oil” (Address to the 22nd Annual Dinner Geological Society of Trinidad and Tobago 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was considerable activity before Drake in various parts of the world in the mid-19th century.

At around the same time the world's first, but small, oil refineries were opened at [[Jasło]], in Poland, with a larger one being opened at [[Ploiești]], in Romania, shortly after. Romania is the first country in the world to have its crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics, namely 275 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&amp;sec=9&amp;art=3596 The History Of Romanian Oil Industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603102058/http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&amp;sec=9&amp;art=3596 |date=2009-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/eakins/we_1844.htm PBS: World Events]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1875, crude oil was discovered by [[David Beaty (businessman)|David Beaty]] at his home in [[Warren, Pennsylvania]]. This led to the opening of the Bradford oil field, which, by the 1880s, produced 77 percent of the global oil supply. However, by the end of the 19th century, the Russian Empire, particularly the [[Branobel]] company in [[Azerbaijan]], had taken the lead in production.&lt;ref name = "Akiner"&gt;Akiner(2004), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry grew through the 1800s, driven by the demand for [[kerosene]] and [[oil lamp]]s. It became a major [[nation]]al concern in the early part of the 20th century; the introduction of the [[internal combustion engine]] provided a demand that has largely sustained the industry to this day. Early "local" finds like those in [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ontario]] were quickly outpaced by demand, leading to "oil booms" in [[Ohio]], [[Texas]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[California]].

By 1910, significant oil fields had been discovered in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (1885, in [[Sumatra]]), [[Persia]] (1908, in [[Masjed Soleiman]]), [[Peru]] (1863, in [[Zorritos District]]), [[Venezuela]] (1914, in [[Maracaibo Basin]]), and Mexico, and were being developed at an industrial level. Significant oil fields were exploited in [[Alberta]] (Canada) from 1947.
First offshore oil drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons in 1949.
Availability of oil and access to it, became of "cardinal importance" in military power before&lt;ref name="oil&amp;pow"&gt;[http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/O-W/Oil-Oil-and-world-power.html Oil and world power], Encyclopedia of the New American Nation&lt;/ref&gt; and after World War I, particularly for navies as they changed from coal, but also with the introduction of motor transport, tanks and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Fromkin]], ''[[A Peace to End All Peace]]'', p.261, 354, (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Such thinking would continue in later conflicts of the twentieth century, including World War II, during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were [[Bombing of German oil facilities during World War II|extensively bombed]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson Baldwin, 1959, [http://www.oil150.com/essays/2007/08/oil-strategy-in-world-war-ii “Oil Strategy in World War II"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815114446/http://www.oil150.com/essays/2007/08/oil-strategy-in-world-war-ii |date=2009-08-15 }}, ''American Petroleum Institute Quarterly&amp;nbsp;– Centennial Issue'', pages 10–11. American Petroleum Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1938, vast reserves of oil were discovered in the [[Al-Hasa|Al-Ahsa]] region along the coast of the Persian Gulf.

Until the mid-1950s [[coal]] was still the world's foremost fuel, but after this time oil quickly took over. Later, following the [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] energy crises, there was significant [[News media|media]] coverage on the subject of oil supply levels. This brought to light the concern that oil is a limited resource that will [[peak oil|eventually run out]], at least as an economically viable energy source. Although at the time the most common and popular predictions were quite dire, a period of increased production and reduced demand in the following years caused an [[1980s oil glut|oil glut in the 1980s]]. This was not to last, however, and by the first decade of the 21st century discussions about [[peak oil]] had returned to the news.

Today, about 90% of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil. Petroleum also makes up 40% of total energy consumption in the United States, but is responsible for only 2% of electricity generation. Petroleum's worth as a portable, dense energy source powering the vast majority of vehicles and as the base of many industrial chemicals makes it one of the world's most important [[commodity|commodities]].

The top three oil producing countries are [[Saudi Arabia]], Russia, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0922041.html InfoPlease]&lt;/ref&gt; About 80% of the world's readily accessible reserves are located in the Middle East, with 62.5% coming from the Arab 5: [[Saudi Arabia]] (12.5%), [[UAE]], [[Iraq]], [[Qatar]] and [[Kuwait]].  However, with high oil prices (above $100/barrel), Venezuela has larger reserves than Saudi Arabia due to its crude reserves derived from [[bitumen]].

{{See also|Fuel cell|l1= Fuel cell}}

A '''home fuel cell''' or a '''residential fuel cell''' is a scaled down version of industrial stationary [[fuel cell]] for primary or backup power generation. These fuel cells are usually based on [[combined heat and power]]-CHP or [[micro combined heat and power]] MicroCHP technology, generating both power and heated water or air. 

A commercially working cell is called Ene-Farm in Japan and is supported by the regional government which uses [[natural gas]] to power up the fuel cell to produce electricity and heated water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Simonian|first1= L.|last2= Korman|first2= T.|last3=Mowrer|first3=F. W.|last4= Phillips|first4= D.|title=Smart Grid and NFPA Electrical Safety Codes and Standards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KA2gCl-tk34C&amp;dq=Smart+Grid+and+NFPA+Electrical+Safety+Codes+and+Standards&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifics==
* High initial [[capital cost]]s – As of December 2012, [[Panasonic]] and [[Tokyo Gas|Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd.]] sold about 21,000 PEM Ene-Farm units in [[Japan]] for a price of $22,600 before installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/2013/01/en130117-5/en130117-5.html Launch of new 'Ene-Farm' home fuel cell product more affordable and easier to install]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Startup time – [[PEMFC]] fuel cell mCHP operates at low temperature  (50 to 100&amp;nbsp;°C) and needs high purity hydrogen, it is prone to contamination, changes are made to operate at higher temperatures and improvements on the fuel reformer. [[SOFC]] fuel cell mCHP operates at a high temperature (500 to 1,000 °CP) and can handle different energy sources well but the high temperature requires expensive materials to handle the temperature, changes are made to operate at a lower temperature. Because of the higher temperature, SOFC in general has a longer start-up time.
* [[Service life|Lifetime]] – Around 60,000 hours. For PEM fuel cell units, which shut down at night, this equates to an estimated lifetime of between ten and fifteen years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/analysis/analyst-views/2013/13-02-27-latest-developments-in-the-ene-farm-scheme Latest developments in the Ene-Farm scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Most home fuel cells fit either inside a mechanical room or outside a home or business, and can be discreetly sited to fit within a building's design.  The system operates like a furnace, water heater, and electricity provider—all in one compact unit.  Some of the newer home fuel cells can generate anywhere between 1–5&amp;nbsp;kW—optimal for larger homes ({{convert|370|sqm|disp=sqbr}} or more), especially if pools, spas, and radiant floor heating are in plans.  Other uses include sourcing of back-up power for essential loads like refrigerator/freezers and electronics/computers.

Deploying the system's heat energy efficiently to a home or business' hot water applications displaces the electricity or gas otherwise burned to create that heat, which further reduces overall energy bills. Retail outlets like [[fast food]] chains, coffee bars, and health clubs gain operational savings from hot water heating.

Since it is in general not possible for a fuel cell to produce at all times exactly the needed amount of both electricity and heat, home fuel cells are typically not standalone installations. Instead they may rely on the grid when the electricity production is above or below what is needed. Additionally, a home fuel cell may be combined with a traditional furnace that produces only heat. For example, the German company [[Viessmann]] produces a home fuel cell with an electric power of 0.75&amp;nbsp;kW and a thermal power of 1&amp;nbsp;kW, integrated with a traditional 19&amp;nbsp;kW heat producing furnace, using the grid for electricity need below and above the fuel cell production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vitovalor.de/de/vitovalor_300-p.html |website= vitovalor.de |title= Vitovalor.de – Brennstoffzellen-Heizgerät Vitovalor 300-P – die stromerzeugende Heizung |accessdate= 29 July 2015 |trans-title= Vitovalor.de – fuel cell-furnace Vitovalor 300-P – the electricity generating heater |language= de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
Because the home fuel cell generates electricity and heat that are both used on site, theoretical efficiency approaches 100%. This is in contrast to traditional or fuel cell non-domestic electricity production with both a transmission loss and useless heat, requiring extra energy consumption for the domestic heating. As noted above however, the home fuel cell can in general not at all times generate exactly the needed amount of both heat and electricity, and is therefore typically not a standalone installation but rather combined with a traditional furnace and connected to the grid for electricity need above or below that produced by the fuel cell. As such, the overall efficiency is below 100%. The optimum efficiency of home fuels cell has caused some countries such as [[Germany]] to economically support their installation as part of a policy reacting to [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.klimaschutz.de/de/programm/richtlinie-zur-foerderung-von-kwk-anlagen-bis-20-kwel-mini-kwk-richtlinie |website= klimaschutz.de |title= Richtlinie zur Förderung von KWK-Anlagen bis 20 kW&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; (Mini-KWK-Richtlinie) |accessdate= 28 July 2015 |trans-title= Guide line for support for CHP-installations up to 20 kW&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; (Mini-CPH-guide line) |language= de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
Home fuel cells are designed and built to fit in either an interior mechanical room or outside—running quietly in the background 24/7. Connected to the utility grid through the home's main service panel and using [[net metering]], the home fuel cells easily integrate with existing electrical and [[hydronic]] systems and are compliant with utility interconnection requirements. In the event of grid interruption the system automatically switches to operate in a grid-independent mode to provide continuous backup power for dedicated circuits in the home while the grid is down. It can also be modified to run [[off-the-grid]], if desired.

=== Current installations ===
Twenty companies have installed [[Bloom Energy]] fuel cells in their buildings, including [[Google]], [[eBay]], and [[FedEx]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2010/02/19/is-k-r-sridhars-magic-box-ready-for-prime-time/ Is K.R. Sridhar's 'magic box' ready for prime time? – Fortune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[eBay]] CEO said to ''[[60 Minutes]]'', that they have saved $100,000 in electricity bills in the 9 months they have been installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/02/18/60minutes/main6221135.shtml The Bloom Box: An Energy Breakthrough? – CBS News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oregon-based [[ClearEdge Power]] has installations of its 5&amp;nbsp;kW system at the home of [[Jackie Autry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LaMonica|first=Martin|title=ClearEdge touts home fuel cells over solar panels|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20037454-54.html|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bay Area Wealth Manager Bruce Raabe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halstead|first=Richard|title=Kent Woodlands resident becomes first in county to power home using fuel cell|url=http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_17426711|publisher=Marin Independent Journal|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VC investor Gary Dillabough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwab|first=Jennifer|title=The cutting edge in green|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jennifer-schwab/the-cutting-edge-in-green_b_796200.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Update – ClearEdge Power went out of business in 2014 and no longer supports any of the 5kW units in the field.

Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf The fuel cell industry review 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==
Most home fuel cells are comparable to residential [[solar energy]] [[photovoltaic system]]s on a dollar per watt-installed basis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} Some natural gas driven home fuel cells can generate eight times more energy per year than the same size solar installation, even in the best solar locations{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. For example, a 5&amp;nbsp;kW home fuel cell produces about 80 MWh of annual combined electricity and heat, compared to approximately 10MWh generated by a 5&amp;nbsp;kW solar system. However, these systems are not directly comparable because solar power is a renewable resource with basically no operating cost while natural


Operating costs for home fuel cells can be as low as 6.0¢ per kWh based on $1.20 per [[therm]] for natural gas, assuming full electrical and heat load utilization.{{where |date=July 2015}}{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Incentives==
In the U.S.A., home fuel cells are eligible for substantial incentives and rebates at both the state and federal levels as a part of [[renewable energy policy]]. For example, the California Self Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) rebate ($2,500 per kW) and Federal Tax Credits ($1,000 per kW residential and $3,000 per kW commercial) will significantly reduce the net capital cost to the customer. For businesses, additional cash advantages can be realized from bonus and accelerated depreciation of fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/distgen/strategic/FITCH.PDF California Energy Commission: Distributed Generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513030135/http://www.energy.ca.gov/distgen/strategic/FITCH.PDF |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, home fuel cells receive [[net metering]] credit in many service areas for any excess electricity generated, but not used, by putting it back on the [[utility grid]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency (DSIRE) provides comprehensive information on state, local, utility, and federal incentives that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/index.cfm Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

===California===
In California in particular, utilities charge higher per kWh rates as energy consumption rises above established baselines – with the top tier set at the highest rates to discourage consumption at those levels.  Home fuel cells reduce customer exposure to the top tier rates, saving homeowners as much as 45% in reduced annual energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/forms/cec-1311.html California Energy Commission on Utility Energy Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market status==
{{further|Micro combined heat and power|Fuel cell}}
Home fuel cells is a new market and represents a fundamental shift in the sourcing of energy.  An individual home fuel cell system installed in a US home becomes a part of the bigger picture of [[U.S. energy independence]].  An ultimate benefit of home fuel cells will be to eventually create networks of micro-CHP systems distributed throughout communities and business parks.  This self-generation of energy in a [[distributed generation]] approach that will secure and increase US power generating capacity, enabling unused electricity to be sent back to the grids without having to add new power plants and transmission lines.  Putting a home fuel cell system into homes has the potential to get people [[off-the-grid]], play a significant role in energy efficiency, and reduce US dependence on foreign energy imports.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''iPhone XR''' (stylized as '''iPhone X🅁''', [[Roman numerals|Roman numeral]] "X" pronounced "ten") is a [[smartphone]] designed and manufactured by [[Apple Inc.|Apple, Inc.]] It is the [[List of iOS devices|twelfth]] generation of the [[iPhone]]. It was announced by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] on September 12, 2018, at [[Steve Jobs Theater]] in the [[Apple Park]] campus, alongside the higher-priced [[iPhone XS|iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.]] Pre-orders began on October 19, 2018, with an official release on October 26, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-xr/|title=iPhone XR:  Everything We Know|work=MacRumors|access-date=September 17, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phone has a 6.1-inch LCD display, and is the least expensive device in Apple's [[List of iOS devices#iPhone|iPhone X line of devices]] with a starting price of $749 in the US, $1029 in Canada, £749 in the UK, €849 in the Eurozone countries and 6499 [[Renminbi|yuan]] in China. It features the same processor as the XS and XS Max, the [[Apple A12|Apple A12 Bionic]] chip built with a [[7 nanometer]] process, which Apple claims is the "smartest and most powerful chip" ever put into a smartphone.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

It is available in six colors: black, white, blue, yellow, [[Coral (color)|coral]] (a shade of pink and orange), and [[Product Red]]. The XR is the second iPhone device to be released in yellow and blue, the first being the [[iPhone 5C]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Internationally, the phone will support dual SIMs through a [[Subscriber identity module#Nano-SIM|Nano-SIM]] and an [[eSIM]]. In mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, dual Nano-SIM (in a single tray) will be offered instead.&lt;ref name="dualsim_china"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learn about Dual SIM with iPhone Xs Max in China, Hong Kong, and Macau|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209086|website=Apple Support|accessdate=September 13, 2018|language=en-SG}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dualsim_china2"&gt;{{cite web|title=iPhone - 机型比较|url=https://www.apple.com/cn/iphone/compare/|website=Apple|accessdate=September 13, 2018|language=zh-CN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

=== Hardware ===
The XR has a similar design to the [[iPhone X]] and [[iPhone XS]]. However, it has larger bezels, an aluminum frame and is available in a wide variety of colors. Similar to other X-branded iPhones, all models come with a black front.

The XR has similar hardware to the XS but with some features removed to reduce the price. Instead of 3D Touch, the XR comes with Haptic Touch where the user long presses until they feel a vibration from the Taptic Engine. The XR also has an LCD display known as Liquid Retina instead of the OLED screen used on the X, XS and XS Max. The display on the XR has a resolution of 1792×828 pixels and a pixel density of 326 PPI compared with 458 PPI on other X-branded iPhones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/14/iphone-xs-vs-iphone-xr-features-tech-specs-pricing/|title=iPhone XS vs. iPhone XR: Design, Tech Specs, and Price Comparison|last=|first=|date=|work=MacRumors|access-date=September 17, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The screen-to-body ratio of the XR is 79.3%, much higher than the 67.5% of the [[IPhone 8|iPhone 8 Plus]] but still lower than most other phones in its price category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/bezel-less-phone-comparison/|title=Here's our comparison of the most bezel-less designs among smartphones|last=Hill|first=Simon|date=September 18, 2018|work=Digital Trends|access-date=September 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other phones in the X-series, the XR ships with a single camera on the back on the phone, featuring very similar specs to the main camera on the XS and XS Max.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Unlike the XS, it does not have optical zoom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2018/09/19/apple-iphone-xs-vs-iphone-xr-whats-the-difference-upgrade|title=Apple iPhone XS Vs iPhone XR: What's The Difference?|last=Kelly|first=Gordon|work=Forbes|access-date=October 15, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the rear single-camera setup, a modified version of Portrait Mode is included. It works unaltered while using the TrueDepth front camera, but with the rear camera it attempts to calculate depth of field using a combination of the focus pixels on the image sensor and AI, resulting in more limitations including lower resolution depth data and subjects not being close enough due to the wide-angle lens being used instead of the missing telephoto lens. At present, only human faces can be recognized in the iOS camera app, however, third party camera apps including Halide are working to allow Portrait Mode to work on other subjects as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1846">A '''light-addressable potentiometric sensor''' (LAPS) is a [[sensor]] that uses light (e.g. [[LED]]s) to select what will be measured. Light can activate carriers in [[semiconductor]]s.

== History ==

An example is the [[pH]]-sensitive LAPS (range pH4 to pH10) that uses LEDs in combination with (semi-conducting) silicon and pH-sensitive [[Ta2O5|Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) insulator. The LAPS has several advantages over other types of chemical sensors. The sensor surface is completely flat, no structures, wiring or passivation are required. At the same time, the "light-addressability" of the LAPS makes it possible to obtain a spatially resolved map of the distribution of the ion concentration in the specimen. The spatial resolution of the LAPS is an important factor and is determined by the beam size and the lateral diffusion of photocarries in the semiconductor substrate. By illuminating parts of the semiconductor surface, electron-hole pairs are generated and a photocurrent flows. 
The LAPS is a semiconductor based chemical sensor with an electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor (EIS) structure. Under a fixed bias voltage, the AC (kHz range) photocurrent signal varies depending on the solution. 
A two-dimensional mapping of the surface from the LAPS is possible by using a scanning laser beam.

A''' mammoty''' ([[Tamil Language|Tamil]]: ''மண்வெட்டி''; [[Sinhala Language|Sinhala]]: '' උදැල්ල '') is a special type of [[garden]] [[hoe (tool)|hoe]] common in [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. 

The Mammoty's blade is about four times as large as the average garden hoe. It is the gardening implement of choice in these countries. Its name, "mammoty" comes from the word "Man Vetty" ("Man" rhymes with "one") in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], a language spoken in Tamil Nadu in India and some northern parts of Sri Lanka. In the Sinhala language, it is called '' Udalla ''. "Mann" in Tamil, language means earth or soil and "Vetti" refers to a cutter. Colloquially it is called as " Mambutty or Mambty ".

There are two types of Manvetti; the Manvetti with the shorter handle and the Manvetti with the longer handle. The short handled Manvetti exerts more pressure but tiresome to use continuously. The long handled Manvetti is less strenuous and useful for long and continued work. The short handled Manvetti is widely used in wet lands for trenching, bunding etc. 
Its important to mention that though the long handled Manvetti is used in states like Kerala in India, the shorter one is preferred or widely used.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13502">A '''modulated neutron initiator''' is a [[neutron source]] capable of producing a burst of [[neutron]]s on activation. It is a crucial part of some [[nuclear weapon design|nuclear weapons]], as its role is to "kick-start" the chain reaction at the optimal moment when the configuration is [[prompt critical]]. It is also known as an '''internal neutron initiator'''. The initiator is typically placed in the center of the [[plutonium pit]], and is activated by impact of the converging [[shock wave]].

One of the key elements in the proper operation of a nuclear weapon is initiation of the fission chain reaction at the proper time. To obtain a significant nuclear yield, sufficient neutrons must be present within the supercritical core at the right time. If the chain reaction starts too soon ("[[Nuclear chain reaction#Predetonation|predetonation]]"), the result will be only a '[[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]] [[nuclear weapon yield|yield]]', well below the design specification, therefore low spontaneous neutron emission of the pit material is crucial. If it occurs too late, the core will have begun to expand and disassemble into a less-dense state, leading to a lowered yield (less of the core material undergoes fission) or no yield at all (the core is no longer a critical mass).

As a general rule, 80 generations of neutron multiplication, in a nuclear (e.g. heavy water) fission reactor, are required in order to achieve explosion-yield equivalent; it must be achieved cca. yield of first 40 neutron generations, in order for a nuclear weapon to be "properly activated." 

For [[boosted fission weapon]]s, the size of the centrally placed initiator is critical and has to be as small as possible. The use of an external neutron source allows more flexibility, such as variable yields.

==Design==
The usual design is based on a combination of [[beryllium]]-9 and [[polonium-210]], separated until activation, then placed in intimate contact by the shock wave. [[Polonium-208]] and [[actinium-227]] were also considered as alpha sources. The isotope used must have strong alpha emissions and weak gamma emissions, as gamma photons can also knock neutrons loose and cannot be so efficiently shielded as alpha particles.&lt;ref name="nwfaq41"&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html Nuclear Weapons FAQ, Section 4.1, Version 2.04: 20 February 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; Several variants were developed, differing by the dimensions and mechanical configuration of the system ensuring proper mixing of the metals.

===Urchin===
'''Urchin''' was the code name for the internal neutron initiator, a [[neutron]] generating device that triggered the [[nuclear detonation]] of the earliest [[plutonium]] [[atomic bomb]]s such as [[The Gadget]] and [[Fat Man]], once the [[critical mass]] had been 'assembled' by the force of conventional explosives.

The initiator used in the early devices, located at the center of the bomb's [[plutonium pit]], consisted of a [[beryllium]] pellet, and a beryllium shell with [[polonium]] between the two. The pellet, 0.8&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, was coated with [[nickel]] and then a layer of [[gold plating|gold]]. The beryllium shell was of 2&amp;nbsp;cm outer diameter with wall thickness of 0.6&amp;nbsp;cm. The inner surface of that shell had 15 concentric, wedge-shaped latitudinal grooves and was, like the inner sphere, coated with gold and nickel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/sciences/chemistry/nuclearchemistry/nuclearweapons/FirstChainReaction/FirstNuclWeapons/DesignGadget.htm The Design of Gadget, Fat Man, and "Joe 1" (RDS-1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210210835/http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/Sciences/Chemistry/NuclearChemistry/NuclearWeapons/FirstChainReaction/FirstNuclWeapons/DesignGadget.htm |date=2010-02-10 }}. Cartage.org.lb. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Voprosy2.html On the Origins of the Soviet Atomic Project]. Nuclearweaponarchive.org (1998-04-15). Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; A small amount of polonium-210 (50 curies, 11&amp;nbsp;mg) was deposited in the grooves of the shell and on the central sphere: the layers of gold and nickel served to shield the beryllium from [[alpha particle]]s emitted by the polonium. The whole urchin weighed about 7&amp;nbsp;grams and was attached to mounting brackets in a 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm diameter inner cavity in the pit.&lt;ref name="nwfaq8"&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html Nuclear Weapons FAQ, Section 8.0, Version 2.18: 3 July 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[shock wave]] from the implosion of the plutonium core arrives, it crushes the initiator. [[Munroe effect|Hydrodynamic forces]] acting on the grooved shell thoroughly and virtually instantly mix the beryllium and polonium, allowing the alpha particles from the polonium to impinge on the beryllium atoms. Reacting to alpha particle bombardment, the beryllium atoms emit [[neutron]]s at a rate of about 1 neutron each 5–10 nanoseconds (See [[Beryllium#Nuclear properties]]). These neutrons trigger the [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]] in the compressed [[critical mass|supercritical]] plutonium. Placing the polonium layer between two large masses of beryllium ensures contact of the metals even if the shock wave turbulence performs poorly.

The 50 curies of polonium generated about 0.1 watts of [[decay heat]], noticeably warming the small sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html 4.1 Elements of Fission Weapon Design]. Nuclearweaponarchive.org (1953-05-19). Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The grooves in the inner surface of the shell shaped the [[shock wave]] into jets by the [[Munroe effect]], similar to a [[shaped charge]], for fast and thorough mixing of the beryllium and polonium. As the Munroe effect is less reliable in linear geometry, later designs used a sphere with conical or pyramidal inner indentations instead of linear grooves. Some initiator designs omit the central sphere, being hollow instead. The advantage of a hollow design is possibly managing a smaller size while retaining reliability.

The short [[half-life]] of polonium (138.376 days) required frequent replacement of initiators and a continued supply of polonium for their manufacture, as their shelf life was only about 4 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/archives_roll/2002_07-09/abrahamson_sandia/abrahamson_sandia.html Abrahamson|The Sandia Pioneers]. Unc.edu. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Later designs had shelf life as long as 1 year.

The US government used Postum as a code name for polonium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/blog/secrecy/2006/12/injecting_polonium_into_humans.html Injecting Polonium into Humans], Federation of American Scientists, December 12th, 2006 by Steven Aftergood&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of polonium for the neutron initiator was proposed in 1944 by [[Edward Condon]]. The initiator itself was designed by [[James L. Tuck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferenc Morton Szasz|title=British scientists and the Manhattan Project: the Los Alamos years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbU_HBx6P2EC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=22 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-06167-8|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its development and testing was carried out at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in "[[Trinity (nuclear test)#The gadget|Gadget]]" division's initiator group led by [[Charles Critchfield]].&lt;ref name='PROJECT'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/acap/institutions/manhattan.jsp | title = The Manhattan Project and predecessor organizations | accessdate = 2013-03-11 | work = Array of Contemporary American Physicists | publisher = American Institute of Physics. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017032813/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/institutions/manhattan.jsp | archivedate = 2012-10-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abner===
A different initiator (code named [[ABNER (detonator)|ABNER]]) was used for the [[Little Boy]] uranium bomb. Its design was simpler and it contained less polonium. It was activated by the impact of the uranium projectile to the target. It was added to the design as an afterthought and was not essential for the weapon's function.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===TOM initiator===
An improved construction of the initiator, probably based on conical or pyramidal indentations, was proposed in 1948, put into production by [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] in January 1950, and tested in May 1951. The TOM design used less polonium, as the number of neutrons per milligram of polonium was higher than of the Urchin. Its outer diameter was only 1&amp;nbsp;cm. The first live fire test of a TOM initiator occurred on 28-Jan-1951 during the Baker-1 shot of [[Operation Ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stealthskater.com/Documents/Nuke_16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of calibration experiments for initiation time vs yield data of the TOM initiators was done during the [[Operation Tumbler-Snapper|Operation Snapper]], during the Fox test on 25 May 1952.

===Flower===
In 1974, India performed the [[Smiling Buddha]] [[nuclear test]]. The initiator, codenamed "Flower", was based on the same principle as the Urchin. It is believed the polonium was deposited on [[Lotus Flower|lotus]]-shaped [[platinum]] [[gauze]] to maximize its surface and enclosed in a [[tantalum]] sphere surrounded by uranium shell with embedded beryllium pellets. According to other sources, the design was yet more similar to the Urchin, with a beryllium shell shaped to create beryllium jets upon implosion. The initiator outer diameter is reported as 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm, or "about 2 cm".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/India/IndiaSmiling.html India's Nuclear Weapons Program – Smiling Buddha: 1974]. Nuclearweaponarchive.org. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other designs===
[[Uranium deuteride]] (UD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be used for construction of a neutron multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6955238.ece ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604161710/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6955238.ece |date=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/2567/uranium-deuteride-initiators Uranium Deuteride Initiators]. ArmsControlWonk (2009-12-14). Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boosted fission weapon]]s and weapons using external [[neutron generator]]s offer the possibility of [[variable yield]], allowing selection of the weapon's power depending on the tactical needs.

==Development==
The polonium used in the urchin initiator was created at Oak Ridge and then extracted and purified as part of the [[Dayton Project]] under the leadership of [[Charles Allen Thomas]]. The [[Dayton Project]] was one of the various sites comprising the [[Manhattan Project]].

In 1949 [[Mound Laboratories]] in nearby [[Miamisburg, Ohio]] opened as a replacement for the [[Dayton Project]] and the new home of nuclear initiator research &amp; development. Polonium-210 was produced by neutron irradiation of [[bismuth]]. Production and research of polonium at Mound was phased out in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/intro/polonium.htm Polonium]. Globalsecurity.org (2005-04-27). Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polonium from Dayton was used by the G Division of Los Alamos in initiator design studies at a test site in Sandia Canyon. The initiator group built test assemblies by drilling holes in large turbine ball bearings, inserting the active material, and plugging the holes with bolts. These test assemblies were known as '''screwballs'''. The test assemblies were imploded and their remains studied to examine how well the polonium and beryllium mixed.&lt;ref&gt;The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes, 1986, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-684-81378-5}} p. 580&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of the beryllium-polonium TOM initiators ended in 1953. The initiators were replaced with a different design, which slightly reduced the weapon yield but its longer shelf life reduced the complexity of the logistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hss.energy.gov/HealthSafety/IHS/marshall/collection/data/ihp1d/73475e.pdf Note by the secretary, Subject: part III – Weapons Progress Report to the Joint Committee, June – November 1953 ]. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt; The '''sealed neutron initiator''', brought into inventory in late 1954, still required a periodic disassembly to access its capsule for maintenance checks. The capsules were phased out completely in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/nuclear-intro.htm United States Nuclear Weapons]. Globalsecurity.org. Retrieved on 2010-02-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urchin style initiators were later superseded by other means of generating neutrons such as [[neutron generator|pulsed neutron emitters]] that do not use polonium. Having no radioactive materials, they didn't require frequent replacement on that account. These were generally mounted outside the pit, since neutrons easily pass through considerable mass without interactions. Also, the hollow core was needed to support a [[boosted fission weapon]] which injected gaseous [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] mixture into the center. These initiators were more controllable and led to much improved weapon reliability.

The '''multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR)''' is a scientific instrument on the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra satellite]] launched by NASA on 18 December 1999. This device is designed to measure the intensity of solar radiation reflected by the [[Earth]] system (planetary surface and atmosphere) in various directions and spectral bands; it became operational in February 2000. Data generated by this sensor have been proven useful in a variety of applications including [[atmospheric sciences]], [[climatology]] and monitoring terrestrial processes.

The MISR instrument consists of an innovative configuration of nine separate digital cameras that gather data in four different spectral bands of the solar spectrum. One camera points toward the [[nadir]], while the others provide forward and aftward view angles at 26.1°, 45.6°, 60.0°, and 70.5°. As the instrument flies overhead, each region of the Earth's surface is successively imaged by all nine cameras in each of four [[wavelength]]s (blue, green, red, and [[near-infrared]]).

The data gathered by MISR are useful in climatological studies concerning the disposition of the solar [[radiation flux]] in the Earth's system. MISR is specifically designed to monitor the monthly, seasonal, and long-term trends of atmospheric [[Particulate|aerosol]] particle concentrations including those formed by natural sources and by human activities, upper air winds and cloud cover, type, height, as well as the characterization of land surface properties, including the structure of vegetation canopies, the distribution of land cover types, or the properties of snow and ice fields, amongst many other biogeophysical variables.

'''Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP)''' is a [[3GPP]] protocol used on the Sx/N4 interface between the control plane and the user plane function, specified in TS 29.244&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/29244.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. It is one of the main protocols introduced in the [[5G]] Next Generation Mobile Core Network (aka [[5GC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.wirelessmoves.com/2018/04/the-5g-core-network-5gc-part-1-network-entities.html|title=The 5G Core Network (5GC) – Part 1 – Network Entities|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but also used in the [[4G LTE|4G/LTE]] [[Evolved Packet Core|EPC]] to implement the [[Control and User Plane Separation]] (CUPS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3gpp.org/cups|title=Control and User Plane Separation of EPC nodes (CUPS)|first=Kevin|last=Flynn|website=www.3gpp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. PFCP and the associated interfaces seek to formalize the interactions between different types of functional elements used in the Mobile Core Networks as deployed by most operators providing 4G, as well as 5G, services to mobile subscribers. These 2 types of components are: 

# The Control Plane (CP) functional elements, handling mostly signaling procedures (e.g. network attachment procedures, management of User-data Plane paths and even delivery of some light-weight services as [[SMS]]) 
# The User-data Plane (UP) functional elements, handling mostly packet forwarding, based on rules set by the CP elements (e.g. packet forwarding for [[IPv4]], [[IPv6]] - or possibly even [[Ethernet]] with future [[5G]] deployments - between the various supported wireless [[Radio access network|RANs]] and the [[Packet Data Network|PDN]] representing the [[Internet]] or an enterprise network). 

PFCP's scope is similar to that of [[OpenFlow]], however it was engineered to serve the particular use-case of [[Mobile network|Mobile Core Networks]]. PFCP lacks the same general-purpose targets, describing well the [[3GPP]]-specific functional basic blocks of packet forwarding used in [[2G]], [[3G]], [[4G LTE|4G/LTE]], Non-3GPP [[Wi-Fi|WiFi]] and [[5G]] networks.

== Overview ==
Albeit similar to [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP]] in concepts and implementation, PFCP is complementary to it. It provides the control means for a signaling component of the Control-Plane to manage packet processing and forwarding performed by an User-Plane component. Typical [[Evolved Packet Core|EPC]] or [[5G]] Packet Gateways are split by the protocol in 2 functional parts, allowing for a more natural evolution and scalability.
[[File:PFCP in EPC.png|alt=PFCP in the Evolved Packet Core - the Sx interface|none|thumb|690x690px|PFCP in the Evolved Packet Core - the Sx interface ([http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/bLHTIyCm57s_l-8ywh9IEgQ8e0moLdoHG1PzsKlcnYoKLhQo-P0VhxrT4mqMzJoCd7Fknyr7DpiqTjziYiPQmY3qP0qvw2SCSVRr53BEjf1mv8D5bCtQsTTP1eU0l4hpjpRT0UGBk2YVDTTFoC4ntEy-20oH276UKr-b-WQoqmHhVSptRJle_1dIw-n1THhwcELy4Ow2OqFDM8iumIDCFwXn3v editable image source])]]
The PFCP protocol is used on the following [[3GPP]] mobile core interfaces:

* Sxa - between SGW-C and SGW-U
* Sxb - between PGW-C and PGW-U
* Sxc - between TDF-C and TDF-U
* N4 - between SMF and UPF

Note: Sxa and Sxb can be combined, in case a merged SGW/PGW is implemented.
[[File:PFCP 5GC.png|alt=PFCP in the 5G Core (aka NGC) - the N4 interface|none|thumb|530x530px|PFCP in the 5G Core (aka NGC) - the N4 interface ([http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/dT8_QyCm40Nm_Jx56-CS8gGjtLeI7BnLY0PdoYAmIGr61bkGnH--rIl-Gpkr3mrtFp-4CJuCqVUnQgBt8c3Kg9glA63t-zc8Ac167DyA-XB5cJPrsASlcKqM6_4xj7N7Fk1djlO9-Eiz_-nSbixEgE41x2E5I2C-Sq-vYdaXRjwpeuMcZI6MhW1cLBYJnIZJvoRki0ffXTVlJKIG1kHTY7tNmh editable image source])]]
== Functionality ==
The Control-Plane functional element (e.g. PGW-C, SMF) controls the packet processing and forwarding in the User-Plane functional elements (e.g. PGW-U, UPF), by establishing, modifying or deleting  PFCP Sessions. Per session multiple PDRs, FARs, QERs, URR and/or BARs are sent.

Here are the main concepts used, organized in their logical association model:

* PDRs - Packet Detection Rules - contain information for matching data packets to certain processing rules. Both outer encapsulation and inner user-plane headers can be matched. The following rules can be applied on positive matching:
** FARs - Forwarding Action Rules - whether and how the packets matching PDRs should be dropped, forwarded, buffered or duplicated, including a trigger for first packet notification; it includes packet encapsulation or header enrichment rules. In case of buffering, the following rules can be applied:
*** BARs - Buffering Action Rules - how much data to buffer and how to notify the Control-Plane.
** QERs - [[Quality of service|QoS]] Enforcement Rules - rules for providing Gating and QoS Control, flow and service level marking.
** URRs - Usage Reporting Rules - contain rules for counting and reporting traffic handled by the User-Plane function, generating reports to enable charging functionality in the Control-Plane functions.

== Transport ==
Very similar to [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP-C]], PFCP uses [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. Port 8805 is reserved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml?search=8805|title=Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry|website=www.iana.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

For reliability, a similar re-transmission strategy as for [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP-C]] is employed, lost messages being sent N1-times at T1-intervals. Transactions are identified by the 3-byte long Sequence Number, the IP address and port of the communication peer.

The protocol includes an own Heart-beat Request/Response model, which allows monitoring the availability of communication peers and detecting restarts (by use of a Recovery-Timestamp Information Element).

For User-Plane packet exchanges between the Control and User Plane functional elements, [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol|GTP-U]] for the Sx-u interface, or alternatively a simpler [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] or [[Ethernet]] encapsulation for the N4-u interface (to be confirmed, as standards are still incomplete).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4726">'''Polymerase cycling assembly''' (or '''PCA''', also known as '''Assembly PCR''') is a method for the assembly of large [[DNA]] [[oligonucleotide]]s from shorter fragments.  The process uses the same technology as [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], but takes advantage of DNA hybridization and annealing as well as [[DNA polymerase]] to amplify a complete sequence of DNA in a precise order based on the single stranded oligonucleotides used in the process.  It thus allows for the production of [[synthetic gene]]s and even entire synthetic [[genome]]s.

== PCA principles ==
[[Image:PCA polymerase cycling assembly.jpg|right|400px|thumbnail]]Much like how primers are designed such that there is a forward primer and a reverse primer capable of allowing DNA polymerase to fill the entire template sequence, PCA uses the same technology but with multiple oligonucleotides. While in PCR the customary size of oligonuleotides used is 18 base pairs, in PCA lengths of up to 50 are used to ensure uniqueness and correct hybridization.

Each oligonucleotide is designed to be either part of the top or bottom strand of the target sequence. As well as the basic requirement of having to be able to tile the entire target sequence, these oligonucleotides must also have the usual properties of similar melting temperatures, hairpin free, and not too GC rich to avoid the same complications as PCR.

During the polymerase cycles, the oligonucleotides anneal to complementary fragments and then are filled in by polymerase. Each cycle thus increases the length of various fragments randomly depending on which oligonucleotides find each other. It is critical that there is complementarity between all the fragments in some way or a final complete sequence will not be produced as polymerase requires a template to follow.

After this initial construction phase, additional primers encompassing both ends are added to perform a regular PCR reaction, amplifying the target sequence away from all the shorter incomplete fragments. A gel purification can then be used to identify and isolate the complete sequence.

== Typical reaction ==
A typical reaction consists of oligonucleotides ~50 base pairs long each overlapping by about 20 base pairs. The reaction  with all the oligonucleotides is then carried out for ~30 cycles followed by an additional 23 cycles with the end primers.&lt;ref name=Stemmer1&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stemmer|displayauthors=etal|title=Single step assembly of a gene and entire plasmid from large numbers of oligodeoxyribonucleotides|journal=Gene|volume=164|issue=1|year=1995|pages=49–53|doi=10.1016/0378-1119(95)00511-4|pmid=7590320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gibson assembly ==
A modification of this method, [[Gibson assembly]], described by Gibson et al. allows for single-step isothermal assembly of DNA with up to several hundreds [[kilobase|kb]]. By using T5 exonuclease to 'chew back' complementary ends, an overlap of about 40bp can be created. The reaction takes place at 50&amp;nbsp;°C, a temperature where the T5 exonuclease is unstable. After a short timestep it is degraded, the overlaps can anneal and be ligated.&lt;ref name="gibson1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibson DG, Young L, Chuang RY, Venter JC, Hutchison CA 3rd, Smith HO |year=2009 |title=Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases |journal=Nature Methods |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=343–345 |publisher= |doi=10.1038/nmeth.1318 |pmid=19363495 |pmc= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge University]] [[International Genetically Engineered Machine|IGEM]] team made a video describing the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=WCWjJFU1be8|title=Gibson Assembly video}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligation independent cloning (LIC) is a new variant of the method for compiling several DNA pieces together and needing only exonuclease enzyme for the reaction. However, the method requires even number of DNA-pieces to be joined together and (usually PCR mediated) synthesis of suitable adapters. LIC cannot thus be regarded as a "non-scarring" sub-cloning method.

The DVB's '''Portable Content Format''' (PCF) is a data format designed by the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] project for the description of interactive digital television ([[Interactive television|iTV]]) services. It is intended to support the business-to-business interchange of interactive content and to enable deployment on multiple target platforms with a minimum amount of re-authoring.

==Introduction==
Today's digital television platforms offer a wide variety of [[Interactive television|interactive services]].  However, different television platforms use different technologies for interactive services and so a large amount of interactive content has to be developed bespoke for each platform. This is time consuming and results in high production costs limiting interactive content to high-profile programming and revenue generating propositions.

==The DVB Portable Content Format==
The DVB PCF is a response to this situation.  The PCF provides a standard format for the description of an author’s intended viewer experience of an interactive service, which can be translated as required for each target platform.

==Characteristics of the DVB PCF==
PCF is a platform-independent description of "what" the viewer experience should be, rather than "how" it should be achieved.  This description must be transformed into a platform-specific format by a "transcoder". This transformation step uses the available features of a particular platform to create the viewer experience described in PCF.
The PCF supports independent description of different aspects of the interactive service, i.e. content, presentation (layout and style), behaviour and navigation.  Furthermore, the PCF does not require all aspects of a service to be described as one physical unit, such as a [[Computer file|file]]. For example, service descriptions can be arbitrarily distributed across files located on the [[Internet]], using references represented as Uniform Resource Identifiers ([[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]).

==Use of Existing Standards==
The PCF embodies a high-level [[Declarative programming|declarative model]] that is based on industry standard formats, including [[XML]] syntax, [[MIME]] types and [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]].

==Objectives of PCF==
* Provide the industry with a standard for the description of interactive content;
* Be capable of describing the majority of existing interactive services.  Those that it is not capable of describing fully would still benefit in some way from the interoperable framework that the PCF will provide;
* Be complementary to existing, deployed interactive technologies.

==Benefits of PCF==
* Simplified interchange of interoperable interactive content, both between content providers, and between content providers and platform operators;
* The ability for content providers and platform operators to choose the best possible tool for their business at all points of the iTV production chain;
* Deployment of interactive content beyond primary markets;
* Reduced production costs for interactive content stimulating new business models.

==Current status==
The PCF specification was published by [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]] in September 2006.

A '''pyrotechnic composition''' is a substance or mixture of substances designed to produce an effect by heat, light, sound, gas/smoke or a combination of these, as a result of non-detonative self-sustaining [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] chemical reactions.  Pyrotechnic substances do not rely on oxygen from external sources to sustain the reaction.

Basic types of pyrotechnic compositions are:
* [[flash powder]] – burns very fast, produces explosions and/or bright flashes of light
* [[gunpowder]] – burns slower than flash powder, produces large amount of gases
* solid [[propellant]]s – produce large amount of hot gases, used as sources of kinetic energy for rockets and projectiles
* [[pyrotechnic initiator]]s – produce large amount of heat, flames, and/or hot sparks, used to ignite other compositions
* [[gas generator]]s – produce large amount of gas, either high volume at short time (for actuators and ejection charges, often using solid propellants) or controlled flow rate (e.g. [[chemical oxygen generator]]s, often using thermite-like compositions)
* [[ejection charge]]s – burn fast, produce large amount of gas at short time, used to eject payloads from containers
* [[burst charge]]s – burn fast, produce large amount of gas at short time, used to fragment a container and eject its content
* [[smoke composition]]s – burn slowly, produce [[smoke]], plain or [[colored smoke|colored]]
* [[delay composition]]s – burn at constant slow speed, used to introduce delays into the firing train
* [[pyrotechnic heat source]]s – produce large amount of heat and little to no gases, slow-burning, often thermite-like compositions
* [[sparkler]]s – producing white or colored sparks
* [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flare]]s – burn slowly, produce high amount of light, used for illumination or signaling
* coloured [[fireworks]] compositions – produce light, white or colored

Some pyrotechnic compositions are used in industry and [[aerospace]] for generation of large volumes of gas in [[gas generator]]s (e.g. in [[airbag]]s), in [[pyrotechnic fastener]]s, and in other similar applications. They are also used in military pyrotechnics, when production of large amount of noise, light, or infrared radiation is required; e.g. [[flare (countermeasure)|missile decoy flares]], [[flash powder]]s, and [[stun grenade]]s. A new class of [[reactive material]] compositions is now under investigation by military.

Many pyrotechnic compositions – especially involving aluminium and perchlorates – are often highly sensitive to friction, impact, and [[static electricity]]. Even as little as 0.1–10 [[millijoule]]s spark can set off certain mixtures.

==Materials used==
Pyrotechnic compositions are usually homogenized mixtures of small particles of fuels and oxidizers. The particles can be grains or flakes. Generally, the higher the surface area of the particles, the higher the reaction rate and burning speed. For some purposes, binders are used to turn the powder into a solid material.

===Fuels===
Typical fuels are based on metal or [[metalloid]] powders. A flash powder composition may specify multiple different fuels. Some fuels can also serve as binders. Common fuels include:

* [[Metal]]s
** [[Aluminium]] – most common fuel in many classes of mixtures, also a combustion instability suppressant. Less energy per mass than carbon but less gas evolution, retaining heat in the reaction mixture. High-temperature flame with solid particles, which interfere with flame colorants. Reacts with nitrates, except ammonium nitrate, yielding nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and heat (the reaction is slow at room temperature but violent at above 80&amp;nbsp;°C and may spontaneously ignite); the reaction can be inhibited by a weak acid, e.g. [[boric acid]]. Corroded by alkaline substances. Flake particles easier to ignite and better for pyrotechnics than spherical ones. In presence of moisture reacts with potassium chlorate and perchlorate, yielding hydrogen. Particle size selected according to the required burn rate.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;
** [[Magnesium]] – more sensitive and violent than aluminium, increases probability of spontaneous ignition in storage. Used in fireworks to increase flame temperature. Less interference with flame color than aluminium.
** [[Magnalium]] – aluminium-magnesium alloy, more stable and less expensive than magnesium; less reactive than magnesium, easier to ignite than aluminium
** [[Iron]] – makes gold sparks, frequently used
** [[Steel]] – an alloy of iron and carbon, makes branching yellow-orange sparks
** [[Zirconium]] – produces hot particles, good for ignition mixtures, e.g. the ''[[NASA Standard Initiator]]'', also a combustion instability suppressant
** [[Titanium]] – produces hot particles, increases sensitivity to impact and friction; sometimes the Ti4Al6V alloy is used which gives a bit brighter white sparks; together with potassium perchlorate it is used in some [[pyrotechnic igniter]]s; coarse powder produces beautiful branching blue-white sparks
** [[Ferrotitanium]] – iron-titanium alloy, produces bright yellow-white sparks, used in pyrotechnic stars, rockets, comets, and fountains
** [[Ferrosilicon]] – iron-silicon alloy, used in some mixtures, sometimes replacement of calcium silicide
** [[Manganese]] – used to control burn rates, e.g. in delay compositions
** [[Zinc]] – used in some [[smoke composition]]s, together with sulfur used in some early amateur rocket fuels, also in pyrotechnic stars; heavy, zinc-based compositions may require additional lift to fly high enough; moisture-sensitive; can spontaneously ignite; rarely used as primary fuel except in smoke compositions, can be encountered as a secondary enhancement fuel
** [[Copper]] – used as a blue colorant with other fuels
** [[Brass]] – a zinc-copper alloy used in some fireworks formulas, as a blue colorant for its copper content
** [[Tungsten]] – used to control and slow down burn rates of compositions, also in delay compositions
** Zirconium-[[nickel]] alloy – used in some military delay compositions
* [[Metal hydride]]s (lower [[heat of combustion]] than pure metals, but increased sensitivity/reactivity to water):
** [[Titanium(II) hydride]] – together with potassium perchlorate it is used in some igniters
** [[Zirconium(II) hydride]] – together with potassium perchlorate it is used in some igniters
** [[Aluminum hydride]] – unstable for storage (decomposes easily with humidity) and reacts dangerously in contact with water
** [[Decaborane]] – experimented with for some rocket fuels
* Metal carbides
** [[Zirconium carbide]] – used in some rocket fuels, also a combustion instability suppressant
* [[Metalloid]]s
** [[Silicon]] – high flame temperature, burns producing molten glass, used in some ignition compositions and delay charges, commonly with [[lead tetroxide]]
** [[Boron]] – used in some ignition mixtures
** [[Antimony]] – used in some fireworks for [[glitter]] effects, toxic, burns bright white; usually used as 200–300 mesh; with potassium nitrate and sulfur produces white fires
* Non-metallic inorganic
** [[Sulfur]] – ignition promoter, increases burn rate; increases sensitivity to temperature, impact and friction, dangerous in combination with chlorates; commonly used with nitrates; used as an additive; may contain residual acids, combination with carbonates or other alkaline stabilizers is advised in acid-sensitive compositions
** [[Red phosphorus]] – extremely dangerous, especially in combination with chlorates ([[Armstrong's mixture]]); used in [[cap gun|caps]]; also used in [[match]]es and some military infrared flares; toxic
** [[White phosphorus]] – used in [[incendiary weapon]]s and to make some military [[smoke screen]]s, ignites spontaneously in air; even more toxic
** [[Calcium disilicide|Calcium silicide]] – used in some special compositions
** [[Antimony trisulfide]] – ignition promoter; fine powder increases sensitivity, sharpens the boom of salutes; toxic and sensitive to static electricity;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemistry.org/portal/a/c/s/1/acsdisplay.html?DOC=HomeMolecule%5Carchive%5Cmotw_antimonytrisulfide_arch.html American Chemical Society]. Chemistry.org. Retrieved on 2010-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  emits bright white light, crystals also used as a fuel in glitter compositions and in white comets and pyrotechnic stars. Sensitive to friction and impact; the degree of sensitisation depends on the oxidizer (sensitive to friction and impact with potassium chlorate, friction with potassium perchlorate, impact with ammonium perchlorate, and insensitive to either with potassium nitrate).
** [[Arsenic sulfide]] ([[realgar]]) – toxic, sensitive to impact and friction. Used for [[report (noise)|report]] compositions due to its sensitivity with chlorate even in small amounts. Used in yellow [[smoke composition]]s due to its low boiling point.
** [[Phosphorus trisulfide]] – used to make [[match]]es
** [[Calcium phosphide]] – liberates [[phosphine]] when wet, used in some naval [[signal flare]]s
** [[Potassium thiocyanate]]

*** [[Graphite]] – also used as [[opacifier]] in rocket fuels to prevent heat transfer by radiation into lower layers of fuels and avoid the related explosions
*** [[Carbon black]] – produces long lasting fine gold sparks in fireworks, also used as opacifier in rocket fuels
** [[Asphaltum]] – carbon-based fuel, also used as a binder. Some forms contain ammonia; should not be combined with chlorates.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;

** [[Accroides resin]] ([[wikt:acaroid resin|red gum]]), higher burning rate than shellac, burns well even with potassium perchlorate. Suitable for chrysanthemum stars.

When metallic fuels are used, the metal particle size is important. A larger surface area to volume ratio leads to a faster reaction; this means that smaller particle sizes produce a faster-burning composition. The shape also matters. Spherical particles, like those produced by atomizing molten metal, are undesirable. Thin and flat particles, like those produced by milling metal foil, have higher reaction surface and therefore are ideal when faster reaction is desired. Using [[nanoparticles]] can drastically affect the reaction rates; [[metastable intermolecular composite]]s exploit this.

A suitable metal fuel may be dangerous on its own, even before it is mixed with an oxidizer. Careful handling is required to avoid the production of [[pyrophoric]] metal powders.

===Oxidizers===
[[Perchlorate]]s, [[chlorate]]s and [[nitrate]]s are the most commonly used oxidizers for flash powders. Other possibilities include [[permanganate]]s, [[chromate]]s, and some [[oxide]]s. Generally, the less the oxidizer, the slower the burning and the more light produced. For use at very high temperatures, [[sulfate]]s can be used as oxidizers in combination with very strongly reducing fuels.

Oxidizers in use include:
* [[Perchlorate]]s (also serving as chlorine donors):
** [[Potassium perchlorate]] – common, relatively stable. Almost non-hygroscopic. Low solubility in water. Produces high temperature flame and smoke of potassium chloride. Safer replacement of potassium chlorate. Impact-sensitive with phosphorus,
** [[Ammonium perchlorate]] – the most common oxidizer for modern solid rocket fuels; more sensitive to mechanical stimuli than potassium perchlorate. Uncommon in fireworks; creates hot flame, enhances barium, strontium and copper [[pyrotechnic colorant|colorants]] by acting as a chlorine donor. Reacts with magnesium when wet and liberates heat and ammonia, can self-ignite. In contact with potassium nitrate (e.g. in black powder) produces potassium perchlorate and [[hygroscopic]] ammonium nitrate; no such reaction with sodium nitrate. Reacts with potassium chlorate, producing unstable, gradually decomposing [[ammonium chlorate]]; such combination has to be avoided.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"&gt;B. J. Kosanke ''et al.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1yJNr92-YcC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=fireworks+colors+molecules+chlorine&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=fireworks%20colors%20molecules%20chlorine&amp;f=false Pyrotechnic Chemistry], Volume 4 of Pyrotechnic reference series, Journal of Pyrotechnics (2004) {{ISBN|1-889526-15-0}} p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Nitronium perchlorate]]
* [[Chlorate]]s (also serving as chlorine donors, incompatible with ammonium salts because of forming unstable explosive [[ammonium chlorate]], incompatible with sulfur and other acidic chemicals because of production of spontaneously igniting [[chlorine dioxide]]; very dangerous with phosphorus; should not be combined with hydrocarbon fuels/binders, e.g. asphalt or gum arabic; should be replaced with safer perchlorates wherever possible):
** [[Potassium chlorate]] – much less stable than perchlorate, hazardous, avoid if possible. High burning speed, easy ignition. Slightly more hygroscopic than potassium nitrate. Produces smoke of potassium chloride. Can act as a chlorine donor. High impact and friction sensitivity with sulfur and sulfides. With ammonium salts produces unstable ammonium chlorate. Used in match head compositions, some [[colored smoke]]s, and small firecrackers and toy caps.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;
** [[Barium chlorate]] – also serves as a green colorant in fireworks; sensitive, better to avoid. Almost non-hygroscopic. Compositions may spontaneously combust in sunlight. Very good green colorant, even in lower-temperature flames.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;
** [[Sodium chlorate]] – much less stable than perchlorate, hazardous, also serves as yellow colorant, [[hygroscopic]]
* [[Nitrate]]s (when mixing with aluminium, boric acid should be added as a stabilizer):
** [[Potassium nitrate]] – very common, used in [[black powder]] and wide variety of compositions. Not very hygroscopic. At lower temperatures (with ordinary fuels like rosin or shellac) not very efficient, does not burn well, produces potassium nitrite. At higher temperatures, with charcoal and sulfur or with magnesium, decomposes well. Does not produce sufficient temperature to make colored flames, except when magnesium is added. Makes good sparks. Presence in dust makes the dust hazardous and very flammable.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;
** [[Sodium nitrate]] – also a yellow colorant, hygroscopic. Gives intense yellow light, used for illumination compositions. Presence in dust makes the dust hazardous. At lower temperatures produces nitrite ash, at higher temperatures decomposes completely.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;
** [[Calcium nitrate]] – also a red-orange colorant.
** [[Ammonium nitrate]] – used in some less common composite rocket propellants, hygroscopic, decomposes at too low temperature; when dry reacts with Al, Zn, Pb, Sb, Bi, Ni, Cu, Ag, Cd; when wet reacts also with Fe. Forms an explosive compound with copper.
** [[Barium nitrate]] – most common oxidizer/colorant for green and white colors, but with somewhat weak colorant effect;requires a chlorine donor. Also used in flash powders and some military infrared flares. Barium also serves as a stabilizer for the mixtures;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/fireworkspyrotechnics/a/bariumfireworks.htm Barium – Elements in Fireworks]. Chemistry.about.com (2010-06-11). Retrieved on 2010-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; decomposes at higher temperatures than nitrates of lighter metals and promotes higher burning temperatures. With aluminium produces bright silver sparks; when used with aluminium, addition of boric acid as stabilizer is advised. Not very hygroscopic.&lt;ref name="pyrochem"/&gt;
** [[Strontium nitrate]] – most common oxidizer/colorant for red colors in flares, fires, and stars; strontium also serves as a stabilizer for the mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/fireworkspyrotechnics/a/strontiumfire.htm Strontium – Elements in Fireworks]. Chemistry.about.com (2010-06-11). Retrieved on 2010-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt; At lower temperatures (with organic fuels) produces strontium nitrite ash which can smother the flame; decomposes completely at higher temperatures (with magnesium). Colorant for low-temperature flames, colorant and oxidizer for hot flames.
** [[Caesium nitrate]] – used in some military infrared flare compositions
* [[Permanganate]]s:
** [[Potassium permanganate]] – used in early mixtures, now considered to be sensitive and unstable
** [[Ammonium permanganate]] – a moderately powerful explosive
* [[Chromate]]s:
** [[Barium chromate]] – used in delay compositions, e.g. in fireworks rockets
** [[Lead chromate]] – used in delay compositions
** [[Potassium dichromate]] – used infrequently as an oxidizer; can be used as a surface treatment for passivation of magnesium particles, also as a catalyst and in some matches; potassium perchlorate often added
* [[Oxide]]s and [[peroxide]]s:
** [[Barium peroxide]] – unstable, spontaneously decomposes, compositions containing it should not be stored
** [[Strontium peroxide]]
** [[Red lead|Lead tetroxide]] – versatile but toxic
** [[Lead dioxide]] – used in friction-sensitive compositions, e.g. [[match]]es
** [[Bismuth trioxide]] – used as a safe alternative to lead tetroxide in some compositions

* [[Sulfate]]s (reactions require high temperatures and strongly reducing fuels):
** [[Barium sulfate]] – a high-temperature oxidizer for e.g. strobe compositions, a green colorant

Corresponding sodium salts can be substituted for potassium ones.

===Additives===

* '''Coolants'''. For some purposes it is necessary to lower the burning temperature of the mixture, and/or slow down the reaction rate. For such purpose, inert materials (e.g. [[clay]], [[diatomaceous earth]], [[alumina]], [[silica]], [[magnesium oxide]], or others) or endothermically decomposing materials (e.g. [[carbonate]]s) are added. [[Oxamide]] is used as a high performance burning rate suppressant in some propellant compositions. [[Strontium carbonate]] is used as a fire retardant in some gunpowders.
* '''[[Flame suppressant]]s'''. [[Potassium nitrate]] and [[potassium sulfate]] are commonly used.
* '''[[Opacifier]]s'''. Some solid rocket propellants have problems with radiative heat transfer through the material, which may lead to explosion. [[Carbon black]] and [[graphite]] are often used to inhibit this effect.
* '''[[pyrotechnic colorant|Colorants]]''', sometimes in combination with sources of [[chlorine]]. Usually salts of suitable metals, often [[barium]], [[strontium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], [[copper]], etc. The salt may simultaneously serve as an oxidizer. [[Copper]] metal can be also used. [[Copper acetoarsenite]] with potassium perchlorate provides richest blue.
* '''Chlorine donors'''. Used together with colorants. In some cases, the color emitting species is molecular and not atomic. Such is the case for blue pyrotechnic flames where the emitting species is copper monochloride. Also, some chloride molecular emitters are much stronger than oxides of the same element, as in the case of Barium and Strontium. [[Polyvinyl chloride]], [[polyvinylidene chloride]], [[Saran (plastic)|Saran]], [[chlorinated paraffin]]s, chlorinated [[rubber]] (e.g. [[Parlon]]), [[hexachloroethane]], [[hexachlorobenzene]] (most common chlorine donor until the 1970s, now rarely used), and some other [[organochloride]]s and inorganic [[chloride]]s (e.g. [[ammonium chloride]], [[mercurous chloride]]) are used as chlorine donors. Perchlorates and chlorates play this role together with their main use as oxidizers. Chlorine donors are often used also in [[smoke composition]]s, e.g. [[hexachloroethane]] together with [[zinc oxide]] to produce [[smoke]] based on [[zinc chloride]].
* '''[[Catalyst]]s'''. Propellant formulas often require a catalyst to burn faster and more stably. [[Transition metal]] ions and complexes tend to be used. Certain oxidizers often serve as catalysts. E.g. [[ammonium dichromate]] is used as a catalyst in ammonium nitrate based propellant formulas. Other catalysts are e.g. [[iron(III) oxide]], hydrated ferric oxide, [[manganese dioxide]], [[potassium dichromate]], [[copper chromite]], [[lead salicylate]], [[lead stearate]], [[lead 2-ethylhexoate]], [[copper salicylate]], [[copper stearate]], [[lithium fluoride]], [[n-butyl ferrocene]], [[di-n-butyl ferrocene]].
* '''[[stabilizer (chemistry)|Stabilizers]]'''. Some mixtures, e.g. containing chlorates, tend to degrade and create acidic byproducts. [[Carbonate]]s (e.g. [[sodium carbonate|sodium]], [[calcium carbonate|calcium]], or [[barium carbonate]]) or other mildly alkaline materials can be added to scavenge such acids. [[Boric acid]] can be used to inhibit the sensitivity of aluminium to moisture, and to stabilize mixtures of metals with nitrates (which can otherwise form amides which react exothermically with metals and can cause spontaneous initiation). Many organic nitrated amines are used as stabilizers as well, e.g. [[2-Nitrodiphenylamine|2-nitrodiphenylamine]]. [[Petroleum jelly]], [[castor oil]], [[linseed oil]], etc. can be used as stabilizers, also to add hydrophobicity to particles and protect metals (especially iron and magnesium) from corrosion. [[Ethyl centralite]] and [[2-nitrodiphenylamine]] are used in some rocket propellants.
* '''[[Anticaking agent]]s'''. E.g. [[fumed silica]]. For powder compositions, e.g. [[flash powder]] or [[gunpowder]]. [[Graphite]] is used in some cases to coat the grains, lubricate them, and dissipate [[static electricity]]. [[Magnesium carbonate]] used too, together with its function as carbonate stabilizer.
* '''[[binder (material)|Binders]]'''. Often [[Natural gum|gum]]s and [[resin]]s, e.g. [[gum arabic]], [[kino (gum)|red gum]], [[guar gum]], [[copal]], [[carboxymethyl cellulose]], [[nitrocellulose]], rice [[starch]], [[cornstarch]], [[shellac]], [[dextrin]]. Binders can also serve as fuels. [[Camphor]] can be used as a [[plasticizer]]. Binders are used in manufacture of compact compositions, e.g. [[pyrotechnic star]]s. Polymers like [[HTPB]] and [[Polybutadiene acrylonitrile|PBAN]] are often used for rocket fuels. Other polymers used are e.g. [[polyethylene]] or [[polyvinyl chloride]] can be encountered as well.
* '''[[Plasticizer]]s'''. Improve the mechanical properties of the propellant particles. For composite rocket propellants, [[dioctyl adipate]], [[isodecyl pelargonate]], and [[dioctyl phthalate]] are often used. Plasticizers can also be [[Plasticizer#Plasticizers for energetic materials|other energetic materials]] (common in smokeless powders), e.g. [[nitroglycerine]], [[butanetriol trinitrate]], [[dinitrotoluene]], [[trimethylolethane trinitrate]], [[diethylene glycol dinitrate]], [[triethylene glycol dinitrate]], [[bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)formal]], [[bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)acetal]], [[2,2,2-trinitroethyl 2-nitroxyethyl ether]], and others.
* '''Curing and [[crosslinking agent]]s'''. Used to harden the polymer component of composite rocket propellants. They include [[paraquinone dioxime]], [[toluene-2,4-diisocyanate]], [[tris(1-(2-methyl) aziridinyl) phosphine oxide]], [[N,N,O-tri(1,2-epoxy propyl)-4-aminophenol]], and [[isophorone diisocyanate]].
* '''Bonding agents'''. Used to increase the level of bonding between the binder and the fuel/oxidizer particles. They include [[tris(1-(2-methyl) azirinidyl) phosphine oxide]] and [[triethanolamine]].

'''2-inch quadruplex video tape''' (also called '''2″ quad''', or just '''quad''', for short) was the first practical and commercially successful [[analog recording]] [[video tape]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videopreservation.conservation-us.org/vid_guide/6/6.html|title=Chapter 6 - All About Videotape|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed and released for the [[broadcast television]] industry in 1956 by [[Ampex]], an [[United States|American]] company based in [[Redwood City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quadvideotapegroup.com/QuadHistory-PageIndex.htm|title=Quad Videotape Group-Quad History-Page Index|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first videotape recorder using this format was built and created in the same year. This format revolutionized broadcast television operations and [[television production]], since the only recording medium available to the TV industry before then was [[film]] used for [[kinescope]]s, which was much more costly to utilize and took time to develop at a [[film laboratory]].  In addition, kinescope images were usually of obviously inferior quality to the live television broadcast images they recorded, whereas quadruplex videotape preserved almost all the image detail of a live broadcast.

Since most [[United States]] West Coast network [[broadcast delay]]s done by the [[television network]]s at the time were done with film kinescopes that needed time for developing, the networks wanted a more practical, cost-effective, and quicker way to [[time shifting|time-shift]] [[television program]]ming for later airing on the West Coast than the expense and time consumption of the processing and editing of film caused. Faced with these challenges, broadcasters sought to adapt [[magnetic tape]] recording technology (already in use for recording audio) for use with [[television]] as well.

The term "quadruplex" refers to the use of four magnetic record/reproduce heads mounted on a headwheel spinning transversely (width-wise) across the tape at a rate of 14,400 (for 960 recorded stripes per second)&amp;nbsp;rpm for [[NTSC]] [[480i|525 lines/30fps]]-standard quad decks, and at 15,000 (for 1,000 stripes per second)&amp;nbsp;rpm for those using the [[PAL]] [[576i|625 lines/25fps]] video standard. This method is called quadrature scanning, as opposed to the [[helical scan]] transport used by later videotape formats. The tape ran at a speed of either {{convert|7.5|or|15|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} per second for NTSC 525/30 video recording, or {{convert|15.625|in|mm|3|abbr=on}} per second for PAL 625/25 video; the audio, control, and cue tracks were recorded in a standard linear fashion near the edges of the tape. The cue track was used either as a second audio track, or for recording [[cue tone]]s or [[time code]] for [[linear video editing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videopreservation.conservation-us.org/vid_guide/5/5.html|title=Chapter 5 - The VTR |publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical {{convert|4800|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} reel of {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} quad tape holds approximately one hour of recorded material at 15&amp;nbsp;inches per second.

The quadruplex format employs segmented recording; each transversely recorded video track on a 2-inch quad videotape holds one-sixteenth (NTSC) or one-twentieth (PAL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/format.html|title=Videotape Formats|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a field of video. (For NTSC systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field.) This meant that 2-inch quad did not support "trick-play" functions, such as still, shuttle, and reverse or variable-speed playback. (In fact, the quadruplex format could only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape was playing at normal speed.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://winkhackman.com/blog/gone-quite-forgotten/ Wink Hackman; Expert training for Sony MVS users worldwide] Retrieved September 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;) However, it was capable of producing extremely high-quality images containing about 400&amp;nbsp;horizontal lines of video resolution, and remained the ''de&amp;nbsp;facto'' industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in 1956 to the mid-1980s, when newer, smaller, and lower-maintenance videotape formats superseded it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videopreservation.conservation-us.org/museum/index.html|title=Equipment Museum|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three different variations of 2-inch quad:

*Low-band, which was the first variety of quad introduced by Ampex in 1956,
*High-band, which used a wider bandwidth for recording video to the tape, resulting in higher-resolution video from the VTR, and
*Super High-band, which used a [[pilot tone]] for better timebase stability, and higher [[coercivity]] tape.

Most quad machines made later in the 1960s and 1970s by Ampex can play back both low and high-band 2-inch quad tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videopreservation.conservation-us.org/vid_guide/9/9.html|title=Chapter 9 - VTR Interchangeability |publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!--Text here that is not related specifically to 2-inch quad tape should go into [[videotape]].--&gt;Time-shifting of television programming for the West Coast of the United States by the networks in the 1950s (in order to broadcast their programming at the same local time on the East and West Coasts) using [[kinescope]] films was quite a rushed and perilous ordeal. This was because there were only three hours for the West Coast branches of the TV networks to receive video for the programming from the East Coast (live via leased microwave relay or coaxial cable circuits provided by the phone company ([[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]]) at the time), and then to record such to kinescope films, and finally to develop the film to be aired three hours later on the West Coast. This usually meant the kinescope was aired almost immediately after it came straight out of the developing equipment, still warm from the film dryer. These were referred to by the networks as "hot kines". By 1954, the networks used more raw film stock for kinescopes than all of the Hollywood film studios combined, spending up to $4,000 per half hour.&lt;ref name="racetovideo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historyoftape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_recording.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603152849/http://www.tvhandbook.com/History/History_recording.htm|title=History of Tape Recording Technology|archivedate=3 June 2004|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were desperate to obtain a quicker, less expensive, and more practical solution.

In the early 1950s, Ampex and several other companies such as [[Bing Crosby#Entrepreneurship|Bing Crosby Enterprises]] (BCE) and [[RCA]] were competing to release a videotape format. RCA and BCE did release working prototypes of their recorders, but their downfall was that they all used a longitudinal (stationary-head) method of recording, much like audio tape recorders. This meant that the tape had to be recorded at an extremely high speed (around {{convert|120|in/s|mm/s|0|abbr=on}}) in order to accommodate sufficient bandwidth to reproduce an adequate video image (at least 2–3&amp;nbsp;MHz for a watchable image), in turn requiring large amounts of tape on large reels. At the same time, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] developed a similar stationary-head [[video tape recorder]] (VTR) system that saw some on-air use, called [[VERA videotape format|VERA]] (Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus).

Ampex, seeing the impracticality of the prototype BCE and RCA VTRs, started to develop a more practical videotape format with tape economy in mind, as well as providing a solution to the networks' West Coast delay woes. Starting in 1952, Ampex built the Mark I prototype VTR,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/mark1.jpg Mark I head from lionlamb.us]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/archead.jpg Mark I head and chart]&lt;/ref&gt; using {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on|adj=on}}-wide tape. Ampex decided that instead of having the tape move at high speed past a stationary head to record enough bandwidth for video, the head would be made to move rapidly across the relatively slow moving tape. This resulted in the Mark I using [[wikt:arcuate#English|arcuate]] scanning, which consisted of a spinning disk with a face (where the heads were mounted) which contacted the tape (as opposed to the edge of the headwheel with transverse quadrature scanning). This resulted in an arc-shaped track being recorded across the width of the tape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danalee.ca/ttt/images/12/TransverseQuad2.gif danalee.ca Transverse Quad chart]&lt;/ref&gt; Arcuate scanning resulted in a head-to-tape speed of about {{convert|2500|in/s|mm/s|0|abbr=on}}, but problems with timebase stability of the reproduced video signal from the tape led Ampex to abandon arcuate scanning in favor of the more reliable transverse scanning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/media/television/ampex_VTR.htm|title=Ampex demonstrates videotape recording|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videopreservation.conservation-us.org/vid_guide/14/14.html|title=Chapter 14 - Maintenance, Troubleshooting, and Minor Repairs |publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ampex continued through the mid-1950s with the Mark II&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/mark2.jpg Mark II from lionlamb.us]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mark III&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/mark3.jpg Mark III]&lt;/ref&gt; prototype recorders, which now used transverse scanning. The Mark II used [[frequency modulation]] for recording video to tape, resulting in a much-improved, but still noisy, video image (the Mark I had used [[amplitude modulation]], which resulted in a very poor-quality video signal reproduced from the tape, compounded as well by the shortcomings of the machine's arcuate scanning).  The Mark III had improved signal-processing and [[Servomechanism|servo]] electronics, resulting in much better video reproduction.

The Mark III worked well, but its appearance was quite that of a prototype, and not a finished, saleable product. It was in a makeshift wooden case, with several parts of its chassis externally mounted in partially filled racks. Ampex then built the Mark IV by putting Mark III components into a sleek metal console and fully populated rack-mount cases.

The Mark IV&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/mark4.jpg Mark 4]&lt;/ref&gt; was the machine first publicly demonstrated at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (now the [[National Association of Broadcasters|NAB]]) convention (the [[NAB Show]]) in [[Chicago]] on April 14, 1956. After William Lodge of CBS finished his speech, the Mark IV replayed his image and words almost immediately, causing "pandemonium" among the astonished attendees.&lt;ref name="racetovideo"&gt;Wolpin, Stewart. "[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1994/2/1994_2_52.shtml The Race to Video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404045940/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1994/2/1994_2_52.shtml |date=April 4, 2011 }}". ''Invention &amp; Technology'', Fall 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier Mark III was given some cosmetic improvements, and was also demonstrated at Ampex headquarters in Redwood City the same day. Both demonstrations were a success, and Ampex took $2&amp;nbsp;million in orders for the machine in four days.&lt;ref name="racetovideo"/&gt;
[[File:Ampex VR 1000-B.JPG|thumb|The VR 1000-B model (1961)]]
[[File:Quadruplex.svg|thumb|The quadruplex system]]

Ampex later released the first manufactured models of quad VTR based on the Mark IV which were also prototypes, the VRX-1000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/vrx1000.jpg VRX-1000 being made at Ampex]&lt;/ref&gt; of which 16 were made. Machines made afterward were the final production models, and were designated as the VR-1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akdart.com/vtr/vtr3.html|title=The First Videotape Machines at KRLD-TV|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertised price for the Ampex Videotape Recorder in late 1956 was $45,000 ({{Inflation|US|45000|1956|fmt=eq|r=-3}}).&lt;ref&gt;"How Much Should a Tape Recorder Cost? [Ampex ad]" Broadcasting-Telecasting, 15 October 1956, 220. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1956/1956-10-15-Quarter-Century-BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, shortly after Ampex's introduction of the 2-inch quad format, [[RCA]] introduced a quad-compatible VTR, the [[TRT-1A]]. RCA referred to it as a "Television Tape Recorder", since the word "videotape" was a trademark of Ampex at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/knackers/behind.html The museum for retired broadcasting equipment in the UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

RCA was able to make the TRT-1A and its later machines compatible with 2-inch quad because Ampex assisted RCA in doing so, as an expression of gratitude for RCA assisting Ampex with making their later quad machines after the VR-1000 color-capable. Initially, the VR-1000 was only natively capable of recording and playing back black and white video, but RCA had modified several VR-1000s to record color video for the NBC TV network (which RCA owned at the time) in the late 1950s, since NTSC color video programming was already underway at NBC.

Ampex developed and released updated and improved models of their quad decks, beginning with the VR-1000B in mid-1959. At that time, Ampex advertised that some  360-plus VR-1000s had been sold worldwide, more than 250 in the U.S.—roughly 30 at each network, 100 by independent stations, and 20 by production companies.&lt;ref&gt;"Announcing the New Ampex VR-1000B," Broadcasting-Telecasting, 22 June 1959, 58-59. http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1959/1959-06-22-BC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The second-generation VR-2000&lt;ref name="VR-2000"&gt;[http://www.lionlamb.us/quad/vr2000_2.jpg VR-2000]&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in 1964. followed by a scaled-down economy version, the VR-1200, in 1966 and the AVR series of VTRs, AVR-1, AVR-2, and AVR-3 in the 1970s. The AVR-2 was the most compact of quad VTRs, using conventional 120&amp;nbsp;volt (V) [[single-phase]] household-type AC power to operate, rather than the 208 or 220&amp;nbsp;V [[three-phase]] AC power required by larger quad machines.

RCA released later models of quad VTRs as well, such as the TR-22, TR-70, and TR-600.

The [[Fernseh]] division of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in Germany released the BCM-40 quadruplex VTR in the 1970s. It was only marketed in Europe, and was not sold in the U.S.

[[CBS]] was the first television network to use 2-inch quad videotape, using it for a West Coast delay of ''[[CBS Evening News|Douglas Edwards and the News]]'' on November 30, 1956.&lt;ref name= "nasginsburg"&gt;"[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4779&amp;page=84 Charles P. Ginsburg]". ''Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering'', Vol. 7. 1994: The National Academies Press, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; The CBS show ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on December 24, 1956 became the first entertainment program to be broadcast live to the nation from New York and taped for a time-delayed rebroadcast in the [[Pacific Time Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Val Adams, "C.B.S. Shows Off Tape-Recorded TV", ''New York Times'',  Dec 21, 1956, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sophia.javeriana.edu.co/~ochavarr/computer_graphics_history/historia/images/1956_VR1000_OnAirAtCBS.jpg CBS, 1956, VR-1000 in use photo from javeriana.edu.co]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, 1957, the NBC game show ''[[Truth or Consequences]]'', produced in Hollywood, became the first program to be broadcast in all time zones from a prerecorded videotape.&lt;ref&gt;"Daily N.B.C. Show Will Be on Tape", ''New York Times'', Jan. 18, 1957, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Edsel Show]]'', on October 13, 1957, was the first CBS entertainment program to be broadcast live to the nation from Hollywood, then tape-delayed for rebroadcast in the Pacific time zone.

The engineers at Ampex who worked on the development of 2-inch quadruplex videotape from the Mark I to the VR-1000 were [[Charles Ginsburg]],&lt;ref name="nasginsburg"/&gt; [[Alex Maxey]], [[Fred Pfost]], [[Shelby Henderson]], [[Charlie Anderson (engineer)|Charlie Anderson]], and [[Ray Dolby]] (who later went on to found [[Dolby Laboratories]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terramedia.co.uk/media/television/Ampex_team_1956.JPG terramedia.co.uk Ampex Team Photo 1956]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i663.photobucket.com/albums/uu353/james_backtor/wwwfernsehmuseuminfo_ampex-emmy-dre.jpg Ampex Team Photo with Emmy from photobucket.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

As two inch machines became more reliable, they began to see use in outside broadcast production. The massive machines required their own truck to house and were incredibly labour intensive requiring considerable on site maintenance. Despite this, these machines allowed for OB video engineers to provide instant replays and generate opening sequences over which captions could be added. &lt;ref&gt;Ellis, John; Hall, Nick (2017): ADAPT. figshare. Collection.https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edit control==
At first, editing was accomplished by physically cutting and splicing the 2" magnetic tape. The tape was "developed" using a solution of fine iron powder suspended in a liquid solvent, marketed as "Edivue" Magnetic Developer. Using a special splicing block (such as the then-industry standard Smith Splicer) equipped with a microscope to view the developed tracks, the editor could then see their patterns and then cut between them. Some 2" splicing blocks instead used a read-only tape head connected to an oscilloscope that enabled the editor to electronically view cue tones or the control track pulses on the tape to determine where the tape should be cut. See [[linear video editing]] for details.

Ampex developed and introduced all-electronic videotape editing, making the physical splicing of videotape practically  obsolete, with its breakthrough Editec system in 1963; by recording cue tones on the tape, the editor could make frame-accurate edits.

RCA had an "electronic splicer" in their TR-4/5 and TR-22 VTRs for frame-accurate edits.

In 1967 EECO created and introduced the EECO-900 edit controller, which used their proprietary On-Time [[SMPTE time code#History|time code]] (the later and more standard SMPTE time code had not yet been developed), which was used in conjunction with the quad machines of the time, and was the successor to Ampex's Editec. The EECO-900 and On-Time timecode were developed from EECO's previous work and products developed for [[NASA]] for logging and timecoding of their [[telemetry]] tapes during [[space mission]]s.

In 1971, [[CMX Systems|CMX]], a collaborative between [[CBS]] and [[Memorex]], introduced the first computer-based edit controller using [[SMPTE]] time code for editing. The CMX 200 could control both the source (A-roll) and record (B-roll) quad VTRs. CMX continued to make more powerful edit controllers capable of controlling more VTRs and peripheral devices, such as [[Vision mixer|switchers]], [[Digital video effect|DVEs]] and [[character generator]]s.

In 1976, [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] introduced the Mach One list-management edit controller, a lower-cost (and less powerful) [[post-production]] alternative to CMX edit controllers. At the time, both CMX and Bosch edit controllers utilized similar [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] computers as their basic hardware.

As [[Type B videotape|1" Type B]] and [[Type C videotape|1" Type C]] VTRs came on the market, list-management editing bays sometimes used a combination of both 1" and 2" VTRs; however, 2" VTRs soon began to disappear from both broadcast and post-production facilities, as the newer 1" machines were smaller, more dependable, used tape that was far less expensive to purchase, and were capable of recording [[stereo]] audio tracks.

The VR-2000 &amp; VR-1200 (and the VR-1100E &amp; VR-1195, as well as some updated VR-1000 VTRs) used modules to correct the playback time base errors of the videotape.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Ampex-Am-Tech-Color-Tech-Proc-Amp.jpg|Photo of Ampex correct units, wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The list of modules are:
*Amtec: Horizontal [[Timebase correction|TBC]]. All that was needed for [[monochrome|B&amp;W]] playback.
*Colortec: Color TBC in line after the Amtec for color playback.
*Editec: (1963) Cue tone editor for frame accurate editing.
*Velcomp: Color velocity TBC correction for better color playback. Optional on some models.
*Procamp: Processing [[amplifier]] on the final output. New [[Component video sync|composite sync]] insertion, level adjustment. Note: all quad VTRs have a procamp so as to obtain a standardized output from a recording. Ampex procamps were occasionally used to clean-up, hence to standardize network feeds.
*Dropout compensation (DOC): Replaced snowy video spots where the FM signal on the [[Videotape|tape]] is missing momentary, caused by a defect in the tape. Optional on some models, both [[Ampex]] and [[3M]] made different models of DOC modules for quad VTRs that can interface with such.
**The components of the VTR were the servo system, video record (modulator) and playback de-modulator) and power supply.

==Military applications==
[[File:AMPEX 2 ZOLL.jpg|thumb|AMPEX VTR VR-3000]]

Because the Ampex VR-3000 model was self-contained portable, the U.S. military used it in a wide variety of reconnaissance applications in various vehicles and aircraft. Its ability to accurately record a wide bandwidth of signals, especially high-frequency signals, was a definite advantage for [[signals intelligence]] applications.

==2-inch quad today==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
2-inch quad is no longer used as a mainstream format in TV broadcasting and video production, having long ago been supplanted by easier-to-use, more practical and lower-maintenance analog tape formats like [[1" type C videotape|1" Type C]] (1976), [[U-matic]] and [[Betacam]]. Television and video industry changes to digital video tape ([[DVCAM]], [[DVCPro]] and [[Digital Betacam]]) and [[High-definition video|high-definition]] ([[HDCAM]]) are making analog tape formats increasingly obsolete.

When it was in use, 2-inch quad VTRs required ongoing maintenance, usually [[Three-phase electric power|3-phase power]] or one phase 220 V to operate, plus an [[air compressor]] to provide air pressure for the [[air bearing]] that the spinning transverse headwheel rode on due to its high rotational speed (some quad VTRs, such as the portable Ampex VR-3000, used ball bearings instead due to the lack of availability of compressed air, but these wore out quickly).

Operation of VR-1000-era machines required the skills of a highly trained [[video engineer]]. When a tape was changed, the operator spent as much as half-an-hour, "lining-up" the VTR — that is, carrying out specialized technical adjustments to calibrate the machine to the tape before it was ready for playback.  From VR-1200/2000 onward, improvements in head manufacturing/refurbishing tolerances, timebase correction, and greater thermal stability of solid-state electronics made tape changes possible in under a minute and servo calibrations needed only once per shift. From AVR-1 onward, servos were self calibrating and tape changes as fast as the operator could articulate threading.

The few quadruplex VTRs which remain in service are used for the transfer and/or restoration of archival 2-inch quad videotape material to newer data storage formats, although mainstream TV serials from the 1950s to late 1960s have mostly already been remastered onto more modern media some years ago, even digitized within the last decade.

{{Memory types}}
[[File:Swissbit 2GB PC2-5300U-555.jpg|right|thumb|Example of [[read/write memory|writable]] [[volatile memory|volatile]] random-access memory: Synchronous [[Dynamic RAM]] [[DIMM|modules]], primarily used as main memory in [[personal computers]], [[workstation]]s, and [[Server (computing)|server]]s.]]

'''Random-access memory''' ('''RAM''' {{IPAc-en|r|æ|m}}) is a form of [[computer data storage]] that stores [[data]] and [[machine code]] currently being used. A [[Random access|random-access]] memory device allows [[data]] items to be [[read (computer)|read]] or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as [[hard disk]]s, [[CD-RW]]s, [[DVD-RW]]s and the older [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tapes]] and [[drum memory]], the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

RAM contains [[multiplexer|multiplexing]] and [[demultiplexing]] circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be "8-bit" or "16-bit", etc. devices.

In today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of [[integrated circuit]]s.  RAM is normally associated with [[Volatile memory|volatile]] types of memory (such as [[DRAM]] [[DIMM|modules]]), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=Memory that never forgets: non-volatile DIMMs hit the market|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|publisher=Ars Technica|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708073138/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|archivedate=2017-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile memories]] exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them. These include most types of [[read only memory|ROM]] and a type of [[flash memory]] called ''[[flash memory#NOR flash|NOR-Flash]]''.

Integrated-circuit RAM chips came into the market in the early 1970s, with the first commercially available DRAM chip, the [[Intel 1103]], introduced in October 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mary|last=Bellis|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa100898.htm|title=The Invention of the Intel 1103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultrasonic delay lines could only reproduce data in the order it was written. [[Drum memory]] could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of [[vacuum tube]] [[triode]]s, and later, out of discrete [[transistor]]s, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.

The first practical form of random-access memory was the [[Williams tube]] starting in 1947.  It stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of a [[cathode ray tube]]. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in England, the Williams tube provided the medium on which the first electronically stored program was implemented in the [[Manchester Baby]] computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Napper | first = Brian | title = Computer 50: The University of Manchester Celebrates the Birth of the Modern Computer | url = http://www.computer50.org/ | accessdate = 26 May 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120504133240/http://www.computer50.org/ | archivedate = 4 May 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby was a [[testbed]] to demonstrate the reliability of the memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|title=Electronic Digital Computers|journal=Nature|volume=162|pages=487|date=Sep 1948|doi=10.1038/162487a0|issue=4117|postscript=.}} Reprinted in ''The Origins of Digital Computers''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|last3=Tootill|first3=G.C.|title=Universal High-Speed Digital Computers: A Small-Scale Experimental Machine|url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/ssem.html|journal=Proc.

[[Magnetic-core memory]] was invented in 1947 and developed up until the mid-1970s. It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings.  By changing the sense of each ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible.

Magnetic core memory was the standard form of memory system until displaced by solid-state memory in integrated circuits, starting in the early 1970s. [[Dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) allowed replacement of a 4 or 6-transistor latch circuit by a single transistor for each memory bit, greatly increasing memory density at the cost of volatility.  Data was stored in the tiny capacitance of each transistor, and had to be periodically refreshed every few milliseconds before the charge could leak away. The [[Toshiba]] Toscal BC-1411 [[electronic calculator]], which was introduced in  1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8406093/toscal-bc-1411-calculator-with-electronic-calculator Toscal BC-1411 calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729145228/http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8406093/toscal-bc-1411-calculator-with-electronic-calculator |date=2017-07-29 }}, [[Science Museum, London]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;[http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/toshbc1411.html Toshiba "Toscal" BC-1411 Desktop Calculator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520202433/http://www.oldcalculatormuseum.com/toshbc1411.html |date=2007-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; used a form of DRAM built from discrete components.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt; DRAM was then developed by [[Robert H. Dennard]] in 1968.

Prior to the development of integrated [[read-only memory]] (ROM) circuits, ''permanent'' (or ''read-only'') random-access memory was often constructed using [[Diode matrix|diode matrices]] driven by [[address decoder]]s, or specially wound [[core rope memory]] planes. {{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph needs a citation.|date=December 2016}}

==Types==
The two widely used forms of modern RAM are [[static random access memory|static RAM]] (SRAM) and [[dynamic random-access memory|dynamic RAM]] (DRAM).  In SRAM, a [[Bit|bit of data]] is stored using the state of a six transistor [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]]. This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used as [[CPU cache|cache memory for the CPU]].  DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and capacitor pair, which together comprise a DRAM cell.  The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it.  As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.

Both static and dynamic RAM are considered ''volatile'', as their state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system.  By contrast, [[read-only memory]] (ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered.  Writeable variants of ROM (such as [[EEPROM]] and [[flash memory]]) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data to [[Persistence (computer science)|persist]] without power and to be updated without requiring special equipment.  These persistent forms of semiconductor ROM include [[Universal serial bus|USB]] flash drives, memory cards for cameras and portable devices, and [[solid-state drives]]. 
[[ECC memory]] (which can be either SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random faults (memory errors) in the stored data, using [[parity bit]]s or [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|error correction codes]].

In general, the term ''RAM'' refers solely to solid-state memory devices (either DRAM or SRAM), and more specifically the main memory in most computers.  In optical storage, the term [[DVD-RAM]] is somewhat of a misnomer since, unlike [[CD-RW]] or [[DVD-RW]] it does not need to be erased before reuse.  Nevertheless, a DVD-RAM behaves much like a hard disc drive if somewhat slower.

==Memory cell==
{{main|Memory cell (computing)}}
The memory cell is the fundamental building block of [[computer memory]]. The memory cell is an [[electronic circuit]] that stores one [[bit]] of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.

In SRAM, the memory cell is a type of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] circuit, usually implemented using [[field effect transistor|FET]]s. This means that SRAM requires very low power when not being accessed, but it is expensive and has low storage density.

A second type, DRAM, is based around a capacitor. Charging and discharging this capacitor can store a "1" or a "0" in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor slowly leaks away, and must be refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power, but it can achieve greater storage densities and lower unit costs compared to SRAM.

|}

==Addressing==
To be useful, memory cells must be readable and writeable. Within the RAM device, multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry is used to select memory cells. Typically, a RAM device has a set of address lines A0... An, and for each combination of bits that may be applied to these lines, a set of memory cells are activated. Due to this addressing, RAM devices virtually always have a memory capacity that is a power of two.

Usually several memory cells share the same address. For example, a 4 bit 'wide' RAM chip has 4 memory cells for each address. Often the width of the memory and that of the microprocessor are different, for a 32 bit microprocessor, eight 4 bit RAM chips would be needed.

Often more addresses are needed than can be provided by a device. In that case, external multiplexors to the device are used to activate the correct device that is being accessed.

==Memory hierarchy==
{{main|Memory hierarchy}}
One can read and over-write data in RAM. Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy consisting of [[processor register]]s, on-die [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] caches, external [[CPU cache|caches]], [[DRAM]], [[paging]] systems and [[virtual memory]] or [[swap space]] on a hard drive. This entire pool of memory may be referred to as "RAM" by many developers, even though the various subsystems can have very different [[access time]]s, violating the original concept behind the ''random access'' term in RAM. Even within a hierarchy level such as DRAM, the specific row, column, bank, [[Memory rank|rank]], channel, or [[interleaved memory|interleave]] organization of the components make the access time variable, although not to the extent that access time to rotating [[storage media]] or a tape is variable. The overall goal of using a memory hierarchy is to obtain the highest possible average access performance while minimizing the total cost of the entire memory system (generally, the memory hierarchy follows the access time with the fast CPU registers at the top and the slow hard drive at the bottom).

In many modern personal computers, the RAM comes in an easily upgraded form of modules called [[DIMM|memory module]]s or DRAM modules about the size of a few sticks of chewing gum. These can quickly be replaced should they become damaged or when changing needs demand more storage capacity. As suggested above, smaller amounts of RAM (mostly SRAM) are also integrated in the [[CPU]] and other [[Integrated circuit|ICs]] on the [[motherboard]], as well as in hard-drives, [[CD-ROM]]s, and several other parts of the computer system.

==Other uses of RAM==
[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A stick of laptop RAM, roughly half the size of desktop RAM.]]
In addition to serving as temporary storage and working space for the operating system and applications, RAM is used in numerous other ways.

===Virtual memory===
{{main|Virtual memory}}
Most modern operating systems employ a method of extending RAM capacity, known as "virtual memory".  A portion of the computer's [[hard drive]] is set aside for a ''paging file'' or a ''scratch partition'', and the combination of physical RAM and the paging file form the system's total memory.  (For example, if a computer has 2 GB of RAM and a 1 GB page file, the operating system has 3 GB total memory available to it.)  When the system runs low on physical memory, it can "[[paging|swap]]" portions of RAM to the paging file to make room for new data, as well as to read previously swapped information back into RAM.  Excessive use of this mechanism results in [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] and generally hampers overall system performance, mainly because hard drives are far slower than RAM.

===RAM disk===
{{main|RAM drive}}
Software can "partition" a portion of a computer's RAM, allowing it to act as a much faster hard drive that is called a [[RAM disk]]. A RAM disk loses the stored data when the computer is shut down, unless memory is arranged to have a standby battery source.

===Shadow RAM===
Sometimes, the contents of a relatively slow ROM chip are copied to read/write memory to allow for shorter access times. The ROM chip is then disabled while the initialized memory locations are switched in on the same block of addresses (often write-protected). This process, sometimes called ''shadowing'', is fairly common in both computers and [[embedded systems]].

As a common example, the [[BIOS]] in typical personal computers often has an option called “use shadow BIOS” or similar. When enabled, functions that rely on data from the BIOS’s ROM instead use DRAM locations (most can also toggle shadowing of video card ROM or other ROM sections). Depending on the system, this may not result in increased performance, and may cause incompatibilities.  For example, some hardware may be inaccessible to the [[operating system]] if shadow RAM is used. On some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the BIOS is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access. Free memory is reduced by the size of the shadowed ROMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|title=Shadow Ram|accessdate=2007-07-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029162135/http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|archivedate=2006-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''

==Recent developments==
Several new types of [[NVRAM|''non-volatile'' RAM]], which preserve data while powered down, are under development. The technologies used include [[carbon nanotube]]s and approaches utilizing [[Tunnel magnetoresistance]]. Amongst the 1st generation [[Magnetoresistive random-access memory|MRAM]], a 128 [[Kibibyte|KiB]] ({{nowrap|128 × 2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;}} bytes) chip was manufactured with 0.18&amp;nbsp;µm technology in the summer of 2003.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In June 2004, [[Infineon Technologies]] unveiled a 16&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]] (16&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) prototype again based on 0.18&amp;nbsp;µm technology. There are two 2nd generation techniques currently in development: [[thermal-assisted switching]] (TAS)&lt;ref&gt;The Emergence of Practical MRAM {{cite web |url=http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427022729/http://www.crocus-technology.com/pdf/BH%20GSA%20Article.pdf |archivedate=2011-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is being developed by [[Crocus Technology]], and [[spin-transfer torque]] (STT) on which [[Crocus Technology|Crocus]], [[Hynix]], [[IBM]], and several other companies are working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218000269|title=Tower invests in Crocus, tips MRAM foundry deal|work=EETimes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119111746/http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218000269|archivedate=2012-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nantero]] built a functioning carbon nanotube memory prototype 10&amp;nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GiB]] (10&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; bytes) array in 2004. Whether some of these technologies can eventually take significant market share from either DRAM, SRAM, or flash-memory technology, however, remains to be seen.

Since 2006, "[[solid-state drive]]s" (based on flash memory) with capacities exceeding 256 gigabytes and performance far exceeding traditional disks have become available. This development has started to blur the definition between traditional random-access memory and "disks", dramatically reducing the difference in performance.

Some kinds of random-access memory, such as "EcoRAM", are specifically designed for [[server farm]]s, where [[low-power electronics|low power consumption]] is more important than speed.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://blogs.zdnet.com/green/?p=1165 "EcoRAM held up as less power-hungry option than DRAM for server farms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630005455/http://blogs.zdnet.com/green/?p=1165 |date=2008-06-30 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory wall==
The "memory wall" is the growing disparity of speed between CPU and memory outside the CPU chip.  An important reason for this disparity is the limited communication bandwidth beyond chip boundaries, which is also referred to as ''bandwidth wall''. From 1986 to 2000, [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed improved at an annual rate of 55% while memory speed only improved at 10%. Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become an overwhelming [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] in computer performance.&lt;ref&gt;The term was coined in {{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111104/http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

CPU speed improvements slowed significantly partly due to major physical barriers and partly because current CPU designs have already hit the memory wall in some sense.  [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] summarized these causes in a 2005 document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Platform 2015: Intel® Processor and Platform Evolution for the Next Decade |date= March 2, 2005 |url= http://epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/pub/Home/TrendsAndConceptsII2010/HW_Trends_borkar_2015.pdf |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110427072037/http://epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/pub/Home/TrendsAndConceptsII2010/HW_Trends_borkar_2015.pdf |archivedate= April 27, 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;First of all, as chip geometries shrink and clock frequencies rise, the transistor [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] increases, leading to excess power consumption and heat... Secondly, the advantages of higher clock speeds are in part negated by memory latency, since memory access times have not been able to keep pace with increasing clock frequencies. Third, for certain applications, traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient as processors get faster (due to the so-called [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|Von Neumann bottleneck]]), further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy. In addition, partly due to limitations in the means of producing inductance within solid state devices, [[resistance-capacitance]] (RC) delays in signal transmission are growing as feature sizes shrink, imposing an additional bottleneck that frequency increases don't address.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The RC delays in signal transmission were also noted in "Clock Rate versus IPC: The End of the Road for Conventional Microarchitectures"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first1=Vikas |last1=Agarwal |first2=M. S. |last2=Hrishikesh |first3=Stephen W. |last3=Keckler |first4=Doug |last4=Burger |title=Clock Rate versus IPC: The End of the Road for Conventional Microarchitectures |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/trips/publications/isca00.pdf |conference=27th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture |conference-url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=339647 |book-title=Proceedings of the 27th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture |location=Vancouver, BC |date=June 10–14, 2000 |access-date=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which projected a maximum of 12.5% average annual CPU performance improvement between 2000 and 2014.

A different concept is the processor-memory performance gap, which can be addressed by [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|3D integrated circuits]] that reduce the distance between the logic and memory aspects that are further apart in a 2D chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=790 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PgYS7zDCM8C&amp;pg=PA790&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |title=Nanoelectronics and Information Technology |author=[[Rainer Waser]] |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801114150/https://books.google.com/books?id=1PgYS7zDCM8C&amp;pg=PA790&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory subsystem design requires a focus on the gap, which is widening over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0IY7LW5J4JgC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |page=109 |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |title=Advances in Computer Systems Architecture: 11th Asia-Pacific Conference, ACSAC 2006, Shanghai, China, September 6-8, 2006, Proceedings |author=Chris Jesshope and Colin Egan |publisher=Springer |date=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801135254/https://books.google.com/books?id=0IY7LW5J4JgC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=processor-memory+performance+gap&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jeM5U93YAqTr2QWc74A4&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=processor-memory%20performance%20gap&amp;f=false |archivedate=August 1, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main method of bridging the gap is the use of [[Cache (computing)|caches]]; small amounts of high-speed memory that houses recent operations and instructions nearby the processor, speeding up the execution of those operations or instructions in cases where they are called upon frequently.

A '''single-ended recuperative (SER) burner''' is a type of [[gas burner]] used in high-temperature industrial kilns and [[Furnace|furnaces]]. These burners are used where indirect heating is required, e.g. where the products of combustion are not allowed to combine with the [[atmosphere]] of the furnace. The typical design is a tubular (pipe) shape with convoluted pathways on the interior, closed on the end pointed into the furnace. A gas burner fires a flame down the center of these pathways, and the hot combustion gases are then forced to change direction and travel along the shell of the tube, heating it to incandescent temperatures and allowing efficient transfer of thermal energy to the furnace interior. [[Exhaust gas]] is collected back at the burner end where it is eventually discharged to the atmosphere. The hot exhaust can be used to pre-heat the incoming combustion air and fuel gas (recuperation) to boost efficiency.

Such burners compete with electrical heating and can be more economical to operate than electric heat, particularly in larger furnaces and in most areas where the price of natural gas per unit of available energy is lower than that of electricity.

These particular furnaces are claimed to have a significant increase in efficiency over other types of furnaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrialheating.com/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000600616|title=Efficient Gas Burners Achieve Significant Energy Savings |last=Merta|first=Joe|date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are said to achieve efficiency up to 80 percent and higher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6426">'''Technological nationalism''' is a way of understanding how technology affects the [[National identity|society and culture]] of a nation. One common example  is the use of technology as the key subject in a Nationalist project, with the goal of promoting connectedness and a stronger national identity. This idea establishes the belief that the success of a nation can be determined by how well that nation innovates and [[Diffusion of innovations|diffuses]] technology across its people. Technological Nationalists believe that the presence of national [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] efforts, and the effectiveness of these efforts, are key drivers to the overall growth, sustainability, and prosperity of a nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/historyofscience/Public/files/edgerton_contradictions_of_technoglobalism.pdf/ The Contradictions of Techno-Nationalism and Techno-Globalism: A Historical Perspective]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u8zlP4480jcC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22technological+nationalism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rg85Zh98gh&amp;sig=iIY12eg2vpTwISrD3ko-oLUP4vM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1r9XVbvkMIXCggSGuoC4Dg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22technological%20nationalism%22&amp;f=false/ Technology and Nationalism by Marco Adria]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaders of innovation==

Technological nationalism is consistently tied to specific countries that are known for their innovative nature. These countries and regions such as [[Great Britain]], [[Germany]] and [[North America]] have become known for being leaders in technological growth. When identifying leaders in technological innovation it has been affirmed "technologies are associated with particular nations. Cotton textiles and steam power are seen as British, chemicals as German, mass production as North American, consumer electronics as Japanese."&lt;ref&gt;[https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/historyofscience/Public/files/edgerton_contradictions_of_technoglobalism.pdf/ The Contradictions of Techno-Nationalism and Techno-Globalism: A Historical Perspective]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries have grown to be prosperous due to their strong economic ties to technological growth, "Historians and others have assumed that Germany and America grew fast in the early years of the twentieth century because of rapid national innovation." Because of the effect that technology has on economic growth there is an implicit tie between economic growth and [[nationalism]]. Britain became an example of this tie between economic prosperity and technological innovation when they invested heavily in technological research and development to match the innovation standards of other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://workspace.imperial.ac.uk/historyofscience/Public/files/edgerton_contradictions_of_technoglobalism.pdf/ The Contradictions of Techno-Nationalism and Techno-Globalism: A Historical Perspective]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesia==

[[Indonesia]] isn't often thought of as an area where excessive innovation occurs. However, in relation to technological nationalism, Indonesia is a front-runner. In 1976, Indonesia established the Industri Pesawat Terban Nusantara or [[Indonesian Aerospace|IPTN]], which is a government issued company that specializes in [[Air travel|air and space travel]]. The IPTN would soon receive a 2 billion dollar investment from the  government, making it among the largest companies in a third world country, let alone one of the only aircraft manufacturers. Because of its overwhelming success, Indonesians felt immense pride for their country and became "a prominent symbol of Indonesian national esteem and pride." Because of this newfound confidence, Indonesians began to consider themselves "equal to Westerners," showing that having pride in one's country can be a direct result of technological investments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/sulfikar/technological-nationalism.pdf/ Nationalist rhetoric and technological development: The Indonesian aircraft industry in the New Order regime] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626072055/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/sulfikar/technological-nationalism.pdf |date=2016-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==

Canada's greatest challenge in the 19th century was to unite the country across a continent. The construction of the CPR (from 1881 to 1885) was a deliberate political and economic attempt to unite Canada's regions and link Eastern and Western Canada, the [[Core-periphery|heartland and hinterland]] respectively. Charland identified this project as based on the nation's faith in technology's ability to overcome physical obstacles.  As the technology was adapted to suit Canadian needs, it fed the national [[rhetoric]] that railroads were an integral part of [[nation building]]. This spirit of technological nationalism also fuelled the development of broadcasting in the country and thus further served in the development of a national identity.  Paradoxically however, these technologies, which historian Harold Innis termed "space-binding," simultaneously supported and undermined the development of a Canadian nation.  Based in connection rather than content, they did not favour any particular set of values, except those arising from trade and communication themselves, and so they also contributed to Canada's integration into first the British, and then the American empire.

=== Year 1960 ===
{{Main article|IBM CP-40|CP/CMS|History of CP/CMS|IBM System/360-67}}
In the mid-1960s, IBM's [[Cambridge Scientific Center]] developed [[IBM CP-40|CP-40]], the first version of [[CP/CMS]]. It went into production use in January 1967. From its inception, [[IBM CP-40|CP-40]] was intended to implement [[full virtualization]]. Doing so required hardware and microcode customization on a S/360-40, to provide the necessary address translation and other virtualization features. Experience on the [[IBM CP-40|CP-40]] project provided input to the development of the [[IBM System/360-67]], announced in 1965 (along with its ill-starred operating system, [[TSS/360]]). [[IBM CP-40|CP-40]] was reimplemented for the S/360-67 as CP-67, and by April 1967, both versions were in daily production use. [[CP/CMS]] was made generally available to IBM customers in source code form, as part of the unsupported [[IBM Type-III Library]], in 1968.

=== Year 1970 ===
{{Main article|System/370|VM (operating system)|History of CP/CMS|hypervisor}}
IBM announced the [[System/370]] in 1970. To the disappointment of [[CP/CMS]] users &amp;ndash; as with the [[System/360]] announcement &amp;ndash; the series would not include [[virtual memory]]. In 1972, IBM changed direction, announcing that the option would be made available on all S/370 models, and also announcing several virtual storage operating systems, including [[VM (operating system)|VM/370]]. By the mid-1970s, [[CP/CMS]], VM, and the maverick [[VP/CSS]] were running on a numerous large IBM mainframes. By the late 80s, there were reported to be more VM licenses than [[MVS]] licenses.

=== Year 1999 ===
{{Main article|x86 virtualization}}
On February 8, 1999, VMware introduced the first [[x86 virtualization]] product, ''VMware Virtual Platform'', based on earlier research by its founders at [[Stanford University]].

=== Year 2005 ===

==== Free desktop virtualization ====
Previously, a substantial licensing fee was required for the use of VMware's Workstation product.  VMware decided to provide high quality virtualization technology to everyone for free.  They omitted the ability to create virtual machines and did not distribute the acceleration tools that come with VMware workstation.  This early corporate play to encourage consumer applications of virtualization went largely unnoticed.

=== Year 2006 ===
This year virtualization has a new level of playing field in [[application virtualization]] and [[application streaming]].

===Year 2008===
[[VMware]] releases [[VMware Workstation]] 6.5 beta, the first program for Windows and Linux to enable DirectX 9 accelerated graphics on Windows XP guests [http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/ws/releasenotes_ws65_beta.html].

==== Overview ====
As an overview, there are three levels of virtualization:
* At the [[Comparison of platform virtualization software|hardware level]], the VMs can run multiple guest OSes. This is best used for testing and training that require networking interoperability between more than one OSes, since not only can the [[guest OS]]es be different from the [[host OS]], there can be as many guest OS as VMs, as long as there is enough CPU, RAM and HDD space. [[IBM]] introduced this around 1990 under the name [[logical partitioning]] (LPAR), at first only in the mainframe field.
* At the [[Operating system-level virtualization|operating system level]], it can only virtualize one OS: the guest OS is the host OS. This is similar to having many [[Terminal Services|terminal server]] sessions without locking down the desktop. Thus, this is the best of both worlds, having the speed of a [[Terminal Services|TS]] session with the benefit of full access to the desktop as a virtual machine, where the user can still control the '''quotas''' for CPU, RAM and HDD. Similar to the hardware level, this is still considered a '''Server Virtualization''' where each guest OS has its own IP address, so it can be used for networking applications such as [[VPS ISP|web hosting]].
* At the [[Comparison of Application Virtual Machines|application level]], it is running on the Host OS directly, without any guest OS, which can be in a locked down desktop, including in a [[Terminal Services|terminal server]] session. This is called Application Virtualization or Desktop Virtualization, which virtualizes the front-end, whereas Server Virtualization virtualizes the back-end. Now, Application Streaming refers to delivering applications directly onto the desktop and running them locally. Traditionally in [[terminal server|terminal server computing]], the applications are running on the server, not locally, and streaming the screenshots onto the desktop.

==== Application virtualization ====
[[Application virtualization]] solutions such as [[VMware ThinApp]], [http://www.softricity.com Softricity], and [http://www.trigence.com/ Trigence] attempt to separate application specific files and settings from the host operating system, thus allowing them to run in more-or-less isolated sandboxes without installation and without the memory and disk overhead of full machine virtualization. Application virtualization is tightly tied to the host OS and thus does not translate to other operating systems or hardware. VMware ThinApp and Softricity are Intel Windows centric, while Trigence supports Linux and Solaris. Unlike machine virtualization, Application virtualization does not use code emulation or translation so CPU related benchmarks run with no changes, though fileystem benchmarks may experience some performance degradation. On Windows, VMware ThinApp and Softricity essentially work by intercepting filesystem and registry requests by an application and redirecting those requests to a preinstalled isolated sandbox, thus allowing the application to run without installation or changes to the local PC. Though VMware ThinApp and Softricity both began independent development around 1998, behind the scenes VMware ThinApp and Softricity are implemented using different techniques:
* VMware ThinApp works by packaging an application into a single "packaged" EXE which includes the runtime plus the application data files and registry. VMware ThinApp’s runtime is loaded by Windows as a normal Windows application, from there the runtime replaces the Windows loader, filesystem, and registry for the target application and presents a merged image of the host PC as if the application had been previously installed. VMware ThinApp replaces all related API functions for the host application, for example the ReadFile API supplied to the application must pass through VMware ThinApp before it reaches the operating system. If the application is reading a virtual file, VMware ThinApp handles the request itself otherwise the request will be passed on to the operating system. Because VMware ThinApp is implemented in user-mode without device drivers and it does not have a client that is preinstalled, applications can run directly from USB Flash or network shares without previously needing elevated security privileges.
* Softricity (acquired by Microsoft) operates on a similar principle using device drivers to intercept file request in ring0 at a level closer to the operating system.  Softricity installs a client in Administrator mode which can then be accessed by restricted users on the machine.  An advantage of virtualizing at the kernel level is the Windows Loader (responsible for loading EXE and DLL files) does not need to be reimplemented and greater application compatibility can be achieved with less work (Softricity claims to support most major applications). A disadvantage for ring0 implementation is it requires elevated security privileges to be installed and crashes or security defects can occur system wide rather than being isolated to a specific application.
Because Application Virtualization runs all application code natively, it can only provide security guarantees as strong as the host OS is able to provide. Unlike full machine virtualization, Application virtualization solutions currently do not work with device drivers and other code that runs at ring0 such as virus scanners.  These special applications must be installed normally on the host PC in order to function.

==== Managed runtimes ====

Another technique sometimes referred to as virtualization, is portable byte code execution using a standard portable native runtime (aka Managed Runtimes).  The two most popular solutions today include [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]].  These solutions both use a process called [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] (Just in time) compilation to translate code from a virtual portable machine language into the local processor’s native code.  This allows applications to be compiled for a single architecture and then run on many different machines.  Beyond machine portable applications, an additional advantage to this technique includes strong security guarantees.  Because all native application code is generated by the controlling environment, it can be checked for correctness (possible security exploits) prior to execution.  Programs must be originally designed for the environment in question or manually rewritten and recompiled to work for these new environments.  For example, one cannot automatically convert or run a Windows / Linux native app on .NET or Java.  Because portable runtimes try to present a common API for applications for a wide variety of hardware, applications are less able to take advantage of OS specific features.  Portable application environments also have higher memory and CPU overheads than optimized native applications, but these overheads are much smaller compared with full machine virtualization.  Portable Byte Code environments such as Java have become very popular on the server where a wide variety of hardware exist and the set of OS-specific APIs required is standard across most Unix and Windows flavors.  Another popular feature among managed runtimes is garbage collection, which automatically detects unused data in memory and reclaims the memory without the developer having to explicitly invoke free(ing) operations.

==== Neutral view of application virtualization ====
Given the industry-biased in the past, to be more neutral, there are also two other ways to look at the Application Level:
* The first type is '''application packagers''' (VMware ThinApp, Softricity) whereas the other is '''application compilers''' (Java and .NET). Because it is a packager, it can be used to stream applications without modifying the source code, whereas the latter can only be used to compile the source code.
* Another way to look at it is from the [[Hypervisor]] point of view. The first one is "hypervisor" in '''user mode''', whereas the other is "hypervisor" in '''runtime mode'''. The hypervisor was put in quotation, because both of them have similar behavior in that they intercept system calls in a different mode: user mode; and runtime mode. The user mode intercepts the system calls from the runtime mode before going to kernel mode. The '''real hypervisor''' only needs to intercept the system call using [https://archive.is/20130210002003/http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/hypercall hypercall] in kernel mode. Hopefully, once Windows have a [[Hypervisor]], [[Virtual machine monitor]], there may even be no need for JRE and CLR. Moreover, in the case of Linux, maybe the [[JRE]] can be modified to run on top of the Hypervisor as a [[loadable kernel module]] running in [[Linux Kernel|kernel]] mode, instead of the having slow legacy runtime in user mode. Now, if it were running on top of the [[Linux Hypervisor]] directly, then it should be called [[Java OS]], not just another '''runtime mode''' [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]].
* [[Mendel Rosenblum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=168 The Reincarnation of Virtual Machines] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815054433/http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=168 |date=2004-08-15 }} ACM Queue vol. 2, no. 5 - July/August 2004 -- by Mendel Rosenblum, Stanford University and VMWare&lt;/ref&gt; called the '''runtime mode''' a High-level language virtual machine in August 2004. However, at that time, the first type, intercepting system calls in user mode, was irresponsible and unthinkable, so he didn't mention it in his article. Hence, [[Application Streaming]] was still mysterious in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnetasia.com/insight/software/0,39044822,39175522,00.htm Application streaming anyone?]
By Brien M. Posey MCSE, Special to ZDNet Asia Wednesday, April 14, 2004 03:55 PM.&lt;/ref&gt; Now, when the [[JVM]], no longer High-level language virtual machines, becomes [[Java OS]] running on [[Linux Hypervisor]], then Java Applications will have a new level of playing field, just as Windows Applications already has with [[Softricity]].
* In summary, the first one is virtualizing the [[Binary Code]] so that it can be '''installed once and run anywhere''', whereas the other is virtualizing the [[Source Code]] using [[Byte code]] or [[Managed code]] so that it can be '''written once and run anywhere'''. Both of them are actually partial solutions to the twin portability problems of: application portability; and source code portability. Maybe it is time to combine the two problems into one complete solution at the [[hypervisor]] level in the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] mode.

====Further development====

[[Microsoft]] bought [[Softricity]] on [https://web.archive.org/web/20070618084423/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jul06/07-17SoftricityPR.mspx July 17, 2006] and popularized [[Application Streaming]], giving traditional Windows applications a level playing field with Web and Java applications with respect to the ease of distribution (i.e. no more setup required, just click and run). Soon every [[Java Runtime Environment|JRE]] and [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] can run virtually in user mode, without kernel mode drivers being installed, such that there can even be multiple versions of [[Java Runtime Environment|JRE]] and [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] running concurrently in RAM.

The integration of the [[Linux Hypervisor]] into the [[Linux Kernel]] and that of the [[Windows Hypervisor]] into the [[Architecture of Windows NT|Windows Kernel]] may make [[rootkit]] techniques such as the [[filter driver]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/filterdrv/default.mspx File System Filter Driver]&lt;/ref&gt; obsolete{{Failed verification|date=August 2010}}.
This may take a while as the Linux Hypervisor is still waiting for the Xen [[Hypervisor]] and VMware [[Hypervisor]] to be [http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1994793,00.asp fully compatible with each other] as [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] [http://www.eweek.com/article2/0%2C1895%2C1996904%2C00.asp impatiently pounding at the door] to let the Hypervisor come into the Linux Kernel so that it can '''full steam ahead''' with its [[Grid Computing]] life. Meanwhile, [[Microsoft]] have decided to be fully compatible with the Xen [[Hypervisor]]
[http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1990366,00.asp]. IBM, of course, doesn't just [https://web.archive.org/web/20070213025947/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5588129.html sit idle] as it is working with VMware for the x86 servers, and possibly helping Xen to move from x86 into [[Power Architecture]] using the open source [[rHype]].
Now, to make the [[Hypervisor]] party into a full house, [[Intel VT-x]] and [[AMD-V]] are hoping to ease and speed up paravirtualization so that a guest OS can be run unmodified. {{Update after|2010|11|13|date=November 2010}} {{Clarify|date=August 2010}}

== Biography ==
Gruber studied [[psychology]] and [[computer science]] at the [[Loyola University New Orleans]], where he received a double major B.S. in 1981 and graduated summa cum laude. He designed and implemented a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) system for programmed-curriculum courses. It was the first of its kind at the university, and is used routinely by the Psychology department for introductory courses. In 1984 he received a M.S. in Computer and Information Science at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. For his Master's research, Gruber designed and implemented an intelligent communication [[prosthesis]] assistant, a computer system which enables people with severe physical disabilities who cannot otherwise speak to communicate in [[natural language]] presented in displayed, written, or spoken form. Four years later in 1988 at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] he received a Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science with the dissertation "The Acquisition of Strategic Knowledge". His dissertation research addressed a critical problem for Artificial Intelligence—knowledge acquisition—with a computer assistant that acquires strategic knowledge from experts.&lt;ref name="TRG95"&gt;[http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/people/gruber/gruber-cv.html Thomas Robert Gruber] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013155712/http://www-ksl.stanford.edu/people/gruber/gruber-cv.html |date=2008-10-13 }}. Home page at Stanford. Last updated 1995. Retrieved 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1988 to 1994 Gruber was a Research Associate at the Knowledge Systems Laboratory of the Computer Science Department at [[Stanford University]]. He worked on the How Things Work, SHADE, and Knowledge Sharing Technology projects. In 1994 he became Senior Project Leader, Enterprise Integration Technologies and proposed and designed several projects using the Internet to create shared, virtual environments for collaborative learning and work (for ARPA, NASA, and NIST). During this time he also proposed a business plan for corporate training. In 1995, he founded and became Chief Technology Officer of [[Intraspect Software]],&lt;ref name = "TRG95"/&gt; an enterprise software company that did early commercial work on collaborative knowledge management. Intraspect applications help professional people collaborate in large distributed communities, continuously contributing to a collective body of knowledge.&lt;ref name= "iswc2006"/&gt;

Gruber has been a member of journal editorial boards of the "Knowledge Acquisition", "IEEE Expert" and "International Journal of Human-Computer Studies".

== Work ==
Gruber's research interests in the 1990s were in the field of developing intelligent networked software to support human collaboration and learning. Areas of specialty include: knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, computer-supported collaborative work, [[computer-mediated communication]] for design, and knowledge sharing technology.&lt;ref name = "TRG95"/&gt;

In 1994 he was responsible for the creation of [[hypermail]], an email to web gateway software that saw extensive use after a rewrite by a different programmer.

In 2007 Gruber co-founded Siri Inc., which created the [[Siri (software)|Siri]] [[intelligent personal assistant]] and [[knowledge navigator]]. Siri Inc. was acquired by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 2010, and Siri is now an integral part of [[iOS]]. In 2016, Siri was added to [[macOS]] in [[macOS Sierra]].

In April 2017 Gruber spoke on the TED stage about his vision for the future of "humanistic AI" especially in regards to augmentation of human capacities such as memory&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gruber|first=Tom|title=How AI can enhance our memory, work and social lives|date=April 2017|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/tom_gruber_how_ai_can_enhance_our_memory_work_and_social_lives|language=en|accessdate=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''TrekkSoft''' is an online booking and payment software provider for tour and activity companies. The [[software as a service]] company is headquartered in [[Interlaken]], Switzerland.

== History ==
TrekkSoft was founded in Interlaken in 2010 by Jon Fauver, Valentin Binnendijk and Philippe Willi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tnooz.com/article/trekksoft-wants-to-make-a-splash-in-the-tour-and-activity-payment-pool/|title=TrekkSoft wants to make a splash in the tour and activity payment pool - Tnooz|website=Tnooz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a raft guide in Nepal, Jon Fauver co-founded Outdoor Interlaken in Switzerland in 2001 and become Co-Owner of Bus2Alps in 2006.

Philippe Willi joined Outdoor Interlaken in 2007 and Bus2Alps as Co-Owner in 2009. Philippe Willi knew Valentin Binnendijk from studying at [[University of St. Gallen]], which put the three founders in contact.

TrekkSoft was founded in 2010.

In 2012, the TrekkSoft platform launched and began offering booking software to tour and activity companies. In June 2012, 55 tour operators were using TrekkSoft booking software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tnooz.com/article/trekksoft-wants-to-make-a-splash-in-the-tour-and-activity-payment-pool/|title=TrekkSoft wants to make a splash in the tour and activity payment pool - Tnooz|website=Tnooz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, TrekkSoft launched its mobile application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventuretravelnews.com/trekksoft-now-including-a-mobile-app|title=TrekkSoft Now Including a Mobile App|website=AdventureTravelNews|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tnooz.com/devices-news-june2013#KM3xhjDHJ3mFp3fR.99|title=DEVICES - Product news, launches and more - June 2013 - Tnooz|website=Tnooz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2016, TrekkSoft has been used by tour and activity providers in 125 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trekkmarket.com/en/|title=Welcome to Marketplace - TrekkMarket.com - Marketplace for Tours &amp; Activities|website=www.trekkmarket.com|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [https://www.trekksoft.com/en/board-management TrekkSoft's current management structure], Jon Fauver is CEO, Valentin Binenndijk is CTO, and Philippe Willi is COO/CFO.

==History==
VR Systems was founded in Florida in 1992 and grew its voter registration system, VoterFocus, in the years following the passage of the [[Help America Vote Act]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="found92"/&gt; In 2004, in response to devastation caused by Hurricane Charley in South Florida, VR created the EViD electronic pollbook designed to check in voters at central locations as many of the precincts in the area had been destroyed. Today, 64 of 67 counties in Florida use VR products.  In 2010, VR became a 100% employee owned company.

===Russian target===
VR Systems was reportedly targeted by operatives of the Russian [[Main Intelligence Directorate]] (GRU) in and around August 2016.&lt;ref name="int1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://slate.com/technology/2018/07/russia-election-hacking-muellers-latest-indictment-suggests-it-could-be-even-more-damaging-next-time.html |publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' |title=Mueller’s Latest Indictment Suggests Russia’s Infiltration of U.S. Election Systems Could Get Worse |first=Lawrence |last=Norden |date=July 16, 2018 |quote=We already know that hackers targeted election systems in 21 states and allegedly hacked into the computers of a private U.S. elections systems vendor.

{{train topics}}
A '''variable gauge''' system allows [[railroad car|railway vehicles]] in a [[train]] to travel across a [[break of gauge]] caused by two railway networks with differing [[track gauge]]s.

For through-operation, a train must be equipped with special trucks holding '''variable gauge wheelsets''' containing a '''variable gauge axle''' (VGA). The gauge is altered by driving the train through a '''gauge changer''' or '''gauge changing facility'''.

As the train passes through the gauge changer, the wheels are unlocked, moved closer together, or further apart, and are then re-locked. Installed variable gauge systems exist within the internal network of Spain, and are installed on international links between Spain/France (Spanish train), Sweden/Finland (Swedish train), Poland/[[Lithuania]] (Polish train) and Poland/[[Ukraine]] (Polish train).

A system for changing gauge, without need for stopping is widespread for passenger traffic in [[Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vialibre-ffe.com/pdf/Unichanger.pdf|title=New generation of gauge changeover Facilities: The UNICHANGER Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in services run on a mix of dedicated high-speed lines (using [[Standard gauge]]) and older lines (using [[Iberian gauge]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.renfe.com/viajeros/nuestros_trenes/avant121_ficha.html|title=Avant Serie 121|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar systems for freight traffic are still rather incipient, as the higher axle weight increases the technological challenge. Although several alternatives exist, including transferring freight, replacing individual [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheels and axles]], [[Bogie exchange|truck exchange]], [[transporter wagon|transporter flatcar]]s or the simple transshipment of freight or passengers, they are impractical, thus a cheap and fast system for changing gauge would be beneficial for cross-border freight traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/26012017-frictions-on-the-new-silk-road-analysis/|title=Frictions On The New Silk Road – Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative names include '''Gauge Adjustable Wheelsets''' (GAW), '''Automatic Track Gauge Changeover System''' (ATGCS/TGCS), '''Rolling Stock Re-Gauging System''' (RSRS), '''Rail Gauge Adjustment System''' (RGAS), '''Shifting wheelset''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Andrzej |last1=Chudzikiewicz |year=2007 |title=Shifting Wheelset |journal=Machine Dynamics Problems |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=46–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Variable Gauge Rolling Truck''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caf.net/ingles/productos/sistemas_brava.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310215540/http://www.caf.net/ingles/productos/sistemas_brava.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 10, 2007 |title=The Variable Gauge Rolling Truck |accessdate=February 18, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; '''track gauge change''' and '''track change wheelset'''.

== Overview ==
Variable gauge axles help solve the problem of a [[break-of-gauge]] without having to resort to [[dual gauge]] tracks or [[transshipment]]. Systems allow the adjustment between two gauges. No gauge changer designs supporting more than two gauges are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Operational Requirements |chapterurl=http://www.unescap.org/ttdw/Publications/TIS_pubs/pub_2182/tarns_ch4.pdf |pages=49–58 |title=Development of the Trans-Asian Railway: Trans-Asian Railway in the North-south Corridor, Northern Europe to the Persian Gulf |url=http://www.unescap.org/publications/detail.asp?id=484 |year=2001 |isbn=978-92-1-120099-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** The BRAVA system was originally designed in 1968 by the [[Ateliers de constructions mécaniques de Vevey|Vevey Company]] (since absorbed by [[Bombardier Transportation]]), a company located in the city of [[Vevey]] on [[Lake Geneva]], in Switzerland.  The system was originally called the "Vevey axle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=''La Vie du Rail'', No. 1415, 4 November 1973|title= ÉCARTEMENTS VARIABLES: ''L' "ESSIEU MIRACLE" EST-IL NÉ DANS LE CANTON DE VAUD?|url=http://www.laviedurail.com|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.webvdr.com/|title=webvdr.com|work=webvdr.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325175953/http://en.webvdr.com/|archivedate=2006-03-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design was subsequently obtained and improved by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF).

In 2009, at [[Roda de Barà]] near [[Tarragona]], a [[Unichanger]] capable of handle four different VGA systems was under development.&lt;ref&gt;[[Railway Gazette International]] July 2009, p20&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International traffic ====
VGA is particularly important with international railway traffic because gauge changes tend to occur more often at international borders.

===== Speed =====

The maximum speed of the trains equipped with the different technologies vary. Only CAF and Talgo produce high-speed VGA, allowing speeds up to 250&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref name="kanclerz2007" /&gt;

== Gauge changer ==
[[File:A1-15v Spurwechselanlage Lérida.jpg|thumb|A ''Talgo'' gauge changing system in [[Lleida]], Spain]]
A gauge changer is a device which forces the gauge adjustment in the wheels. Designs consist of a pair of running rails that gradually vary in width between the two gauges, combined with other rails and levers to unlock, move, support and re-lock the adjustable axles.

In the Spanish Talgo-RD system, a constant spray of water is used to lubricate the metal surfaces, to reduce heat and wear. A Talgo-RD gauge changer is 20&amp;nbsp;metres long and 6&amp;nbsp;metres wide.

=== Operation ===
Variable gauge [[multiple unit]]s, or a train including a variable gauge locomotive (e.g. Talgo 250) and rolling stock, may drive straight across a gauge changer.  Normally the locomotive will not be able to change gauge, meaning that it must move out of the way whilst the remainder of the train itself passes through. On the opposite side, a new locomotive of the other gauge will couple to the train.

A train (or an individual car) can be pushed halfway across the gauge-changer, uncoupled, and then (once far enough across) coupled to the new locomotive and pulled the rest of the way. A long length of wire-rope with hooks on the end means that the process can be asynchronous, with the rope used to bridge across the length of the gauge changer (to temporarily couple the arriving cars and receiving locomotive, although without braking control from the locomotive to the train vehicles).

On long-distance trains in Spain and night trains crossing from Spain into France, the arriving locomotive stops just short of the gauge changer, uncouples and moves into a short siding out of the way. Gravity then moves the train through the gauge changer at a controlled low speed. The new locomotive is coupled onto the front only after the full train has finished passing through the changer.

== Countries ==

=== Australia ===
In 1933, as many as 140 inventions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22205479 |title=BREAK OF GAUGE. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |location=Qld. |date=14 August 1933 |accessdate=4 February 2011 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  were offered to Australia railways to overcome the breaks of gauge between the different states. None was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1435271?searchTerm=break+gauge+124http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/1435271 |title=04 Sep 1918 – BREAK OF GAUGE PROBLEM REPORT OF BOARD OF EXPERT |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20 of these devices were adjustable wheels/axles of some kind or another, which may be analogous to the modern [[Variable gauge axle|VGA]]. VGA systems were mostly intended for Broad Gauge and Standard Gauge lines.

=== Canada ===
Variable gauge axles were used for a while on the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] in the 1860s in [[Rail gauge#Canada|Canada]] to connect {{RailGauge|5ft6in}} and {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}} [[standard gauge]] without transshipment. Five-hundred vehicles were fitted with "adjustable gauge trucks" but following heavy day-in, day-out use the system proved unsatisfactory, particularly in cold and snowy weather. The system used telescoping axles with wide hubs that allowed the wheels to be squeezed or stretched apart through a gauge-changer, after holding pins had been manually released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Niagara Rails |url=http://home.cogeco.ca/~trains/rrall.htm |title=Introduction |accessdate=2008-09-17 |quote=two mechanical solutions were tried: the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|GWR]] used a dual gauge system requiring a third rail, and the [[Grand Trunk Railway|GTR]] used adjustable gauge trucks. However neither method proved satisfactory, and full conversion to [[standard gauge]] became necessary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826200640/http://home.cogeco.ca/~trains/rrall.htm |archivedate=2013-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Break of Gauge at Prescott Junction|publisher=Colin Churcher's railway pages|accessdate=2008-09-03|url=http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2003_1.html|quote=The scheme selected was patented by C.D. Tisdale of East Boston, Massachusetts, with the first patent having been issued in March 1863. Special wheels with extra-large hubs were fitted with key wedges. The axles were notched so that the wheels could be set at standard or 5 -foot 6-inch gauge. The keys were locked in place by a long safety pin and giant rubber bands. The position of the wheel was shifted by a gradually diverging or converging track. In the shift from broad to standard, the keys would be loosened and removed at one end of the tapering track, workmen in a 4-foot-deep pit removed the keys from below the train. A long shed was built over the pits to protect the workmen. With the keys out, the train was slowly pushed down the track, and the wheels-would be forced inward as the train moved along the converging rails. Once at the end, the workers would reinsert and lock the wedges and the train could go on its way. The change could be done in five to ten minutes. When shifting to broad gauge, a third rail set inside the tapering track pushed the wheel out to the wider gauge. Shifting stations were located at [[Pointe-Saint-Charles]], [[Montreal]], and [[Sarnia, Ontario]]. The plan was first tried in November 1863, yet no serious consideration was given to it until early 1868. The tests proved so promising that by late in the following year two hundred adjustable-gauge cars were running between Chicago and Boston via the Michigan Central, the Grand Trunk, the Vermont Central, and several connecting lines in New England. The problems of the northern east-west route seemed to have been resolved, and three hundred more cars were ordered by National Despatch. [...] his disruptive and costly conversion might have been avoided had the variable-gauge trucks worked as well as advertised. Problems obviously had developed. The keyway grooves were said to weaken the axles. Misgivings over the safety of the telescoping axles were voiced as early as 1846, long before the Grand Trunk test. Considerable skepticism was expressed as to the reliability of the workmen charged with loosening and tightening so many wheels day in and day out."|work=Bytown Railway Society, Branchline, June 2003|date=June 2003|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165453/http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2003_1.html|archivedate=2008-08-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2003_1.html |title=Break of Gauge at Prescott Junction |publisher=Railways.incanada.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165453/http://www.railways.incanada.net/Articles/Article2003_1.html |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spain ===
Spain is the largest user of variable gauge systems. This is because of the need to connect older mainlines built to [[Iberian gauge]] and extensive new [[high-speed rail]]way lines and connections to France, using the standard gauge. Two gauge changes are installed on lines to France and at all entrances/exits leading between the high-speed network and older lines. There are also significant lengths of {{RailGauge|1000mm}} secondary lines but these are not connected to the main network. 

In February 2004, RENFE placed orders for:

Trams ran between [[Leeds tramway|Leeds]] ({{RailGauge|uksg|allk=on|disp=or}}) and [[Bradford Corporation Tramways|Bradford]] ({{RailGauge|4ft|lk=on|disp=or}} gauge) following a successful trial in 1906 using Bradford tram car number 124. The system was later patented by – GB190601695 (A) of 1906. This system was improved again in patent GB190919655 (A) of 1909 by introducing a locking system acting on the wheel and axle rather than just the wheel rim. This provided a more effective grip where the wheel was free to move along the [[Spline (mechanical)|splined]] axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mylearning.org/jpage.asp?jpageid=2113&amp;journeyid=465 |title=Inventions in Transport from Bradford |publisher=Mylearning.org |date=1907-01-22 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://worldwide.espacenet.com/classification?locale=en_EP#!/CPC=B61F7/00 Patent]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with truck exchange ==

=== Time taken ===

In VGA, the train is pulled through the "adjuster" at about 10&amp;nbsp;km/h&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQQ/is_7_39/ai_58678001 | title=Variable-Gauge Wagon Wheelsets – Brief Article | date=1999-07-01 | work=International Railway Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2.77&amp;nbsp;m/s) without any need to uncouple the wagons or disconnect (and test) the brake equipment.

=== Spares ===

VGA always has the exact number of wheels of each gauge and they are always at hand, whereas with truck exchange, there must be a complete set of trucks of the right gauge and with wheels of the same diameter at the depot.

Truck exchange needs a stock of spare trucks of each gauge, which need to be shunted as required. If there is an influx of traffic one might run out of trucks of the other gauge. Depending on the sophistication of the exchange facility, the cars may need to be uncoupled for the truck exchange to take place.

=== Locomotives ===
Steam locomotive are generally not gauge convertible on-the-fly. While diesel locomotives can be truck exchanged,&lt;ref&gt;[[Motive Power]]{{Volume needed|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is not normally done owing to the complexity in the reconnection of cables and hoses. In Australia, some locomotives are transferred between gauges. The transfer might happen every few months, but not for an individual trip.

A '''warrant canary''' is a method by which a [[communications service provider]] aims to inform its users that the provider has been served with a secret government [[subpoena]] despite legal prohibitions on revealing the existence of the subpoena. The warrant canary typically informs users that there has ''not'' been a secret subpoena as of a particular date. If the canary is not updated for the time period specified by the host or if the warning is removed, users are to assume that the host has been served with such a subpoena. The intention is to allow the provider to warn users of the existence of a subpoena passively, without disclosing to others that the government has sought or obtained access to information or records under a secret subpoena.

Secret subpoenas, such as those covered under 18 U.S.C. [[Patriot Act, Title V#National security authorities|§2709(c)]] of the [[USA Patriot Act]], provide criminal penalties for disclosing the existence of the warrant to any third party, including the service provider's users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |pages=78–79 |work= [[Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy]] |publication-date=2005 |volume=29 |issue=73 |title=Safety and freedom: Common concerns for conservatives, libertarians, and civil libertarians |author=Nadine Strossen|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlpp/Vol29_No1_Strossen.pdf |accessdate= January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Eunice Moscoso |publication-date=August 17, 2003 |title= Subpoenas Fly In Hunt For Hidden Terrorists|work= [[Palm Beach Post]] |page=1A}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

United States secret subpoenas or [[national security letters]] originated in the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act|1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act]] to be used only against those suspected of being agents of a foreign power.&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{Citation |author=Shaun Waterman |publication-date=September 30, 2004 |title=Ashcroft: U.S. will appeal terror-law ruling |work= [[United Press International]] |page= |url= http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2004/09/30/Ashcroft-US-will-appeal-terror-law-ruling/UPI-66781096585901/|accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was revised in 2001 under the [[Patriot Act]] so that secret subpoenas can be used against anyone who may have information deemed relevant to [[Counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism organizations|counter-intelligence]] or terrorism investigations.&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt; The idea of using negative pronouncements to thwart the nondisclosure requirements of [[court order]]s and served secret warrants was first proposed by Steven Schear on the [[cypherpunk]]s [[Electronic mailing lists|mailing list]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/cypherpunks-lne-archive/message/5869 |title=Re: ISP Utility To Cypherpunks? Yahoo! Groups |publisher=Tech.groups.yahoo.com |date=October 31, 2002 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly to uncover targeted individuals at [[ISP]]s. It was also suggested for and used by public libraries in 2002 in response to the [[USA Patriot Act]], which would force librarians to disclose the circulation history of any of their patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarian.net/technicality.html |last=West |first=Jessamyn |title=Five Technically Legal Signs for Your Library |publisher=Librarian.net : avoiding the PATRIOT Act since 2001 |year=2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021218044219/http://www.librarian.net/technicality.html |archivedate=December 18, 2002 |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/09/nsa-sabotage-dead-mans-switch |accessdate=2013-11-14 |title=How to foil NSA sabotage: use a dead man's switch - Technology | publisher=The Guardian (UK) |date=September 9, 2013 |first=Cory |last=Doctorow }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==

The first commercial use of a warrant canary was by the US [[cloud storage]] provider rsync.net, which began publishing its canary in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6ecu/an_isp_that_protects_your_data_from_the_nsa/|title=An ISP that protects your data from the NSA|publisher=Reddit - May 26, 2006|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to a [[digital signature]], it provides a recent news headline as proof that the warrant canary was recently posted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsync.net/resources/notices/canary.txt |title=rsync.net Warrant Canary |publisher=rsync.net |accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as mirroring the posting internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.kozubik.com/john_kozubik/2010/08/the-warrant-canary-in-2010-and-beyond.html |title=The Warrant Canary in 2010 and Beyond |first=John |last=Kozubik |date=August 6, 2010 |publisher=Blog.kozubik.com |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2013, Apple became the most prominent company to publicly state that it had never received an order for user data under Section 215 of the Patriot Act.&lt;ref name=ars1&gt;{{cite web|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|title=Apple takes strong privacy stance in new report, publishes rare "warrant canary"|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/11/apple-takes-strong-privacy-stance-in-new-report-publishes-rare-warrant-canary/|publisher=ArsTechnica.com|accessdate=5 November 2013|date=5 November 2013&lt;!-- Please don't use for "not tested in any court" claim - circular.

Three PGP signatures from geographically distributed signers must sign each message — so if a government agency forced SpiderOak to update the page, they would need to enlist the help of all three signers.&lt;ref name="Kumparak-2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kumparak|first1=Greg|title=SpiderOak Implements A Warrant Canary|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/14/spideroak-implements-a-warrant-canary/|website=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc.|accessdate=28 January 2017|date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, US security researcher [[Moxie Marlinspike]] wrote that "every lawyer I've spoken to has indicated that having a 'canary' you remove or choose not to update would likely have the same legal consequences as simply posting something that explicitly says you've received something."&lt;ref name="Marlinspike-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/WhisperSystems/whispersystems.org/issues/34#issuecomment-56448994 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027143819/https://github.com/WhisperSystems/whispersystems.org/issues/34 |archivedate=27 October 2014 |title=If it's illegal to advertise that you've received a court order of some kind... |last=Marlinspike |first=Moxie |website=GitHub |date=22 September 2014 |accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyer|first1=David|title=How Reddit Strongly Hinted It Received a Secret Surveillance Order|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/01/reddit-warrant-canary/|website=Fortune|publisher=Time Inc.|accessdate=3 April 2016|date=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] outlawed the use of a certain kind of warrant canary in March 2015, making it illegal for a journalist to "disclose information about the existence or non-existence" of a warrant issued under new mandatory data retention laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boingboing.net/2015/03/26/australia-outlaws-warrant-cana.html | title=Australia outlaws warrant canaries | work=Boing Boing | accessdate=March 26, 2015 | author=Doctorow, Cory}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely a journalist could give a correct canary in this situation anyway, as under this legislation the agency obtaining the warrant is not compelled to inform the journalist of the warrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/19/australias-new-improved-data-retention-laws-how-will-they-work | title=Australia's new 'improved' data retention laws: how will they work? | work=Guardian Australia | accessdate=March 30, 2015 | author=Hurst, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, computer security and privacy specialist [[Bruce Schneier]] wrote in a blog post that "[p]ersonally, I have never believed [warrant canaries] would work. It relies on the fact that a prohibition against speaking doesn't prevent someone from not speaking. But courts generally aren't impressed by this sort of thing, and I can easily imagine a secret warrant that includes a prohibition against triggering the warrant canary. And for all I know, there are right now secret legal proceedings on this very issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/03/australia_outla.html |title=Australia Outlaws Warrant Canaries |author= Schneier, Bruce |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |website=Schneier on Security |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That said, case law specific to the [[United States]] would render the covert continuance of warrant canaries subject to constitutionality challenges. [[West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette]] and [[Wooley v. Maynard]] rule the Free Speech Clause prohibits compelling someone to speak against one's wishes; this can easily be extended to prevent someone from being compelled to lie. [[New York Times Co. v. United States]] protects one exercising the First Amendment to publish government information, even if it is against the wishes of the government, except under grave and exceptional circumstances previously set by act and precedent. The latter also carries the weight of acting against a direct government intervention similar to a government intervention against a warrant canary.

==Canary Watch==

In 2015, a coalition of organizations consisting of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]], [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]], [[New York University School of Law|NYU Law]], the [[Calyx Institute]], and the [[Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society|Berkman Center]] created a website called Canary Watch in order to provide a compiled list of all companies providing warrant canaries. Its mission was to provide prompt updates of any changes in a canary's state. It is often difficult for users to ascertain a canary's validity on their own and thus Canary Watch aimed to provide a simple display of all active canaries and any blocks of time that they were not active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rt.com/usa/230055-canary-website-information-requests/ | title=Canary Watch: Activists create website to track &amp; reveal NSA, FBI info requests | work=Russian Times | date=6 February 2015 | accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gizmag.com/canary-watch-government-information-requests/35932/ | title=Canary Watch tracks government requests for your information online | work=Gizmag | date=4 February 2015 | accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, it was announced that Canary Watch "will no longer accept submissions of new canaries or monitor the existing canaries for changes or take downs".&lt;ref name="Quintin-2016-05-25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/canary-watch-one-year-later|title=Canary Watch – One Year Later|last=Quintin|first=Cooper|website=Deeplinks|type=Blog|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition of organizations which created Canary Watch explained their decision to discontinue the project by stating that it has achieved its goals to raise awareness about "illegal and unconstitutional national security process, including National Security Letters and other secret court processes." The Electronic Frontier Foundation also noted that "the fact that canaries are non-standard makes it difficult to automatically monitor them for changes or takedowns".&lt;ref name="Quintin-2016-05-25"/&gt;

'''Willgodt Theophil Odhner''' (in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], Вильгодт Теофил Однер) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer and entrepreneur, working in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. He was the inventor of the [[Odhner Arithmometer]], which by the 1940s was one of the most popular type of portable [[Calculator#The_19th_century|mechanical calculator]] in the world.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"&gt;Trogemann G., Nitussov A.: ''Computing in Russia'', page 39-45, GWV-Vieweg, 2001, {{ISBN|3-528-05757-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a brochure distributed by Odhner's company at the Paris World exposition of 1900 "...Odhner had, in 1871, an opportunity to repair a [[Arithmometer|Thomas calculating machine]] and then became convinced that it is possible to solve the problem of mechanical calculation by a simpler and more appropriate way". It took him 19 years to perfect the design of this new machine so it could be manufactured effectively.

==Early years==
Odhner studied at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]] from 1864 to 1867 but left before graduating.&lt;ref name="Trogemann"/&gt; At age 23, in 1868, he moved to [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], even though he didn't speak any Russian. As soon as he arrived, he went to the Swedish consulate, which found him a job in a local mechanical workshop. A few months later he joined the Nobel's mechanical factory owned by a Swede named Ludvig Nobel (1831–1888), brother of [[Alfred Nobel]] of Nobel Prize fame, where he worked until 1877. In 1878 he joined the Expedition, a large paper mill and printing house, and worked there until 1892.

==Manufacturing of the Arithmometer==
While working at the Expedition, Odhner started his own workshop in 1885,&lt;ref name="Trogemann"/&gt; building high quality production machines for local manufacturing businesses. One of his biggest project was the manufacturing of printing presses, he also made cigarette-making machines and all kind of scientific instruments. Odhner officially started the production of his arithmometer in this workshop in 1890. Early on, Mr. F. N. Hill, a British citizen, became his associate but he left the company around 1897, making Odhner the sole proprietor until his death in 1905. 

After Odhner's death, his sons Alexander and Georg and son-in-law Karl Siewert continued the production and about 23,000 calculators were made before the factory was forced to close down in 1918.

Independent [[Clone (computing)|clone]] makers from all over the world, including Russia, carried the design from 1893 well into the 1970s.
[[File:Odhner made before 1900.jpg|thumb|center|400px|An early machine built by W.T. Odhner in St. Petersburg before 1900]]

==Family==
In 1871 he married Alma Skånberg the daughter of Fredrik Skånberg, a Nobel coworker. They had seven children. Unfortunately Emilia, their second child, died at age 2 in 1877, the same year Alma, their third child was born. 

W. T. Odhner died of a heart attack on 15 September 1905 ([[Gregorian calendar]]) in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7873">[[Image:YangshupuWaterworks4.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the waterworks.]]
The '''Yangshupu Waterworks''' (Chinese: 杨树浦水厂) is a waterworks built in 1883, and located at 830 Yangshupu Road (杨树浦路830号) in the district of [[Yangpu District|Yangpu]], [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. The waterworks was the first of its kind to be built in China and provided running water for the first time to some of the cities' residents. It belongs to the Shanghai Water Company and occupies a site of 12.9 hectares and has four major lines of tap water allowing for a maximum capacity of around 1.5 million cubic metres a day. In 2009 it supplied 400 million cubic metres of water, about 20% of the total water supply of Shanghai.

In 2013, the site was designated as a [[Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level]] by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] of China, one of [[List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Shanghai|28 sites in Shanghai]]. The site is also of importance due to the effect it had on China's early modern industries in the 1880s and 1890s, with many factories being built around the waterworks providing electricity, gas, vehicles and textiles. It is regarded as the birthplace of China's modern industry by the Shanghai municipal government. Furthermore, the site is protected due to its unique architecture.

To the east and west of the waterworks used to lie the docks. The waterworks lie to the south west of the [[Yangshupu Power Plant|Yangshupu Power Station]].

==History==
[[File:杨树浦水厂图纸.jpg|thumb|A drawing of the planned pumping station from 1880 or 1881.]]
[[File:Yangshupu Water Plant.jpg|thumb|The waterworks during the late Qing dynasty period of either the 1890s or 1910s.]]
In 1880 the Shanghai Waterworks Co. Ltd were founded in London, United Kingdom. British and Chinese engineers provided expertise with British investors providing the funds, to built a waterworks in Shanghai in what was at that time the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], a merging of the previous British and American settlement areas which had existed before 1863. Building started in August 1881 and the design was carried out by the British architect J.W. Hart (赫德), in the style of an English castle.

On 29 June 1883, [[Li Hongzhang]] the [[Viceroy of Zhili]] of the Qing Dynasty, opened the water gate valve and thus opened the waterworks. It was the first waterworks to be built in China, and at the time of its construction the largest in East Asia. During the 1930s the site was much larger spanning 25.9 hectares.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shine.cn/archive/District/yangpu/Knowledge-the-key-for-Yangpu/shdaily.shtml Shanghai Daily - Knowledge The Key For Yangpu]. 31 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, Zhabei Waterworks (闸北水厂) was built to the west of Yangshupu Waterworks on Hengfeng Road. It supplied water to residents and factories on that side of the city, decreasing the usage of the Yangshupu Waterworks. In 1926 the waterworks in Zhabei were moved to their present location on Zhayin Road.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/Districts/Yangpu/userobject1ai1322944.html Shanghai Daily - Old Buildings Worth A Look]. 8 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s, the waterworks was providing around 300,000 cubic metres of water a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/living_in_china/news/2009-07/30/content_18236242.htm Shanghai Daily - Preserving Historic Factories]. 30 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2001, for the first time in its history the waterworks opened its gates to the general public. Several thousand Shanghai residents applied for tickets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/english/TR-e/9415.htm People's Daily - Visiting Factories: New Modes of Tourism in Shanghai]. 21 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Architecture==
The buildings and its perimeter wall were designed to resemble English castles featuring pink and grey brickwork and mock turrets. At the top of the walls and on the roofs are crenellation to resemble a castle's parapet.

==Protection==
[[Image:YangshupuWaterworks1.jpg|thumb|State protection plaque.]]
In 1989, the site was designated a monument of importance for the city of Shanghai, and became protected and preserved as a historical site by the Shanghai city government.

In 2013, the site was designated (7-1694) a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level by the State Council of China, giving it national protection.

==Shanghai Waterworks Science and Technology Museum==
Some of the buildings of the site now host the Shanghai Waterworks Science and Technology Museum (上海自来水科技馆) which was opened in Autumn 2003. It has three exhibitions detailing the history, technology and future of the waterworks.

==Surroundings==
[[File:杨树浦水厂.jpg|thumb|The waterworks is situated on the north bank of the river.]]
Due to the importance of its role in supplying running water, numerous factories and workshops were rapidly built around the Yangshupu Road, many of which were likewise the first of their kind in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yptimes.cn/resfile/2017-10-28/07/07.pdf 杨浦时报 - New Casual Dining Project Added to Oriental Fisherman's Wharf]. 28 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The most important are listed below:

'''Zi Corporation''' was a [[software]] company based in [[Calgary]], Canada. The company was founded on 4 December 1987 as Cancom Ventures Inc, owning an [[Edmonton]] secretarial college and an industrial equipment rental business. On 30 August 1989 the name was changed to Multi-Corp Inc. In 1993, board member Michael Lobsinger took control of the company, became CEO, and turned the company towards the [[telecommunications]] industry, purchasing several privately held companies involved in the telecommunications businesses,&lt;ref name=China&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/business-strategy/china-calling/|title=China calling|publisher=[[Canadian Business]]|date=22 November 2004|last1=Wahl|first1=Andrew|accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 1993, Multi-Corp entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Eric Chappell for a stroke-based [[Chinese language|Chinese]] text entry system which they referred to as the ''Jiejing Licenses''.&lt;ref name=Geist&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geist|first1=Richard|title=Investor Therapy: A Psychologist and Investing Guru Tells You How to Out-Psych Wall Street|date=23 Sep 2003|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-60960-916-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wholly owned subsidiary, Ziran Developments Inc, was formed to handle the Chinese text entry business. 
The company was listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] on 9 June 1995 (symbol MCU).&lt;ref name=Klein /&gt; Under Lobsinger, the strategic importance of the Chinese text entry grew, and Ziran was renamed Zi Corporation in 1996; ''Zi'' meaning ''character'' in Chinese. 
The telecommunications businesses were disposed of by 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/DisplayFiling.aspx?TabIndex=2&amp;FilingID=5832654&amp;companyid=97501&amp;ppu=%252fdefault.aspx%253fcompanyid%253d97501%2526amp%253bformtypeId%253d53 Zi Corp entry], Edgar Online.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1997, the parent company was renamed Zi Corporation to reflect the importance of the new business. In 1999, co-founder [[Gary Kovacs]] joined as COO.&lt;!-- left in 2003 for Macromedia --&gt;

Having started with Chinese on [[personal computer]]s, toward the end of the 1990s Zi's focus moved to text entry for all languages for [[mobile phone]]s and other handheld devices, where efficient entry of text traditionally has been challenging due to limitations of a physically small device.&lt;ref name=China /&gt; This new business area was quickly quite successful, especially in the Chinese market, and in 1998 Zi entered into licensing agreements with Ericsson (later [[Sony Ericsson]]), who at that time was a very significant player in the Chinese market.&lt;ref name=China /&gt;&lt;ref name="1998 Annual Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zi Corporation 1998 Annual Report|url=http://globaldocuments.morningstar.com/documentlibrary/document/3405d5ef283dbaf1.msdoc/original|website=[[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]|publisher=Zi Corporation|accessdate=27 December 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further license agreements with Ericsson and other companies were to follow, for a total of more than 1000 different device models being shipped with Zi text entry software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Au|first1=Maggie|title=Sony Ericsson signs expansion deal with Zi Corp.|journal=[[Telecom Asia]]|date=16 September 2008|url=http://www.telecomasia.net/content/sony-ericsson-signs-expansion-deal-zi-corp-0|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[touch screen]] technology for mobile devices made the company follow up with software for handwriting recognition, with focus on languages such as Chinese and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].
In 2003, Mike Donnell took over as CEO from Lobsinger.&lt;ref name=China /&gt;
Zi Corporation was listed on [[NASDAQ]] from September 2007 .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/zi-corporation-application-to-trade-on-the-nasdaq-capital-market-approved-nasdaq-zica-766930.htm Zi Corporation Application to Trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market Approved]&lt;/ref&gt;

Text entry on devices with limited number of keys was early subject to a number of [[software patent]]s, and Zi was engaged in several costly patent disputes with [[Tegic Corporation]], later [[Nuance Communications]].
In August 2008, Nuance made a takeover bid to acquire the company for {{USD|40.4}} million, which the company declined. Shortly thereafter, Nuance filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Zi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kapko|first1=Matt|title=Nuance Sues Zi Corp.

==Products==
Zi's main product was ''EZiText'' [[predictive text entry]] software, in competition with solutions such as the original [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] product from Tegic, later Nuance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/06/16/zi-announces-advanced-chinese-text-messaging-input-system/ |title=Zi announces advanced Chinese text messaging input system]|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent war==
There was a series of [[patent infringement]] lawsuits between Tegic, the holder of the T9 patents, and Zi:

* In September 2002,  the U.S. District Court for Northern California awarded Tegic, owned by [[AOL]] [[Time Warner]], {{USD|9}} million in damages for Zi's infringement of two Tegic patents.

* In 2003, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] froze the assets of Lancer Group, a [[hedge fund]] investment management firm, when it discovered it owned 49.1% of Zi's shares, far beyond the 10% limit requiring disclosure.
