'''Abai''' is a [[Murutic language]] of [[Borneo]] spoken in by the Abai people in the villages of Sembuak and Tubu.  ''Ethnologue'' mistakenly classifies it as a dialect of [[Putoh language|Putoh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jasonlobel.com/52-1-Lobel-SouthwestSabahRevisited-OLJune2013-36to68.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16329">An '''advertorial''' is an [[advertisement]] in the form of editorial content. The term "advertorial" is a [[blend word|blend]] (see [[portmanteau]]) of the words "advertisement" and "editorial." [[Merriam-Webster]] dates the origin of the word to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/advertorial|title=Advertorial - Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In printed publications, the advertisement is usually written to resemble an [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] article and designed to ostensibly look like a legitimate and independent news story. In television, the advertisement is similar to a short [[infomercial]] presentation of products or services. These can either be in the form of a television commercial or as a segment on a talk show or variety show. In radio, these can take the form of a radio commercial or a discussion between the announcer and representative. The concept of internet-based advertorials is linked to [[native advertising]]; however, whether the two terms are [[synonym]]ous is a point of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digiday.com/publishers/native-ads-or-advertorials/|title=Native Ads or Advertorials?|last= Sternberg|first=Josh|publisher=''[[Digiday]]''|date=September 25, 2012 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2014/02/28/when-native-advertising-not-just-glorified-advertorial|title=When is native advertising not just glorified advertorial? |last= Turner|first=Francis|publisher=The Drum|date= February 28, 2014|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Advertorials can be classified into three types:
* Image advertorials:  The organization running the advertisement wants to produce a favorable view of the organization or its products among the readers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZB0NjVq3goC&amp;pg=PT142|title=Governing Health: The Politics of Health Policy|last=Weissert|first=William G.|last2=Weissert|first2=Carol S.|date=2012-07-13|publisher=JHU Press|year=|isbn=9781421408460|location=|pages=142|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Advocacy advertorials:  The organization wants to explain their view of a controversial subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Journalism advertorials:  The organization wants to attract media attention to a subject or themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Their goal may be inspiring independently written stories about their area of interest, to get quoted in related stories, or to influence how journalists will write about a subject in the future.

==Publications==
Advertorials differ from traditional advertisements in that they are designed to look like the articles that appear in the publication. Most publications will not accept advertisements that look exactly like stories from the newspaper or magazine they are appearing in. The differences may be subtle, and disclaimers—such as the word "advertisement"—may or may not appear.  Sometimes terms describing the advertorial such as a "special promotional feature" or "special advertising section" are used. The tone of the advertorials is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective news story.

Advertorials can also be printed and presented as an entire newspaper section, inserted the same way within a newspaper as store fliers, comics sections, and other non-editorial content. These sections are usually printed on a smaller type of [[broadsheet]] and different [[newsprint]] than the actual paper, along with different fonts and column layouts. Many newspapers and magazines will assign staff writers or freelancers to write advertorials, usually without a [[byline]] credit. A major difference between regular editorial and advertorial is that clients usually have content approval of advertorials, a luxury usually not provided with regular editorial.

A related practice is the creation of material that looks like traditional media (for instance, a newspaper or magazine) but is actually created by a company to market its products. One familiar example is airline in-flight magazines, which may feature reports about travel destinations to which the airline flies.&lt;ref name="Adair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/09/10/news_pf/Worldandnation/Corporate_spin_can_co.shtml|title=Corporate spin can come in disguise|last=Adair|first=Bill|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=2009-01-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090103194045/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/09/10/news_pf/Worldandnation/Corporate_spin_can_co.shtml| archivedate= 3 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, a UK based company called Parkway Publishing began publishing advertorials for advertisers. Parkway began enlisting clients and created PRPros to function as PR via advertorials with great success.  The cottage industry is now widely used and considered very successful. Sheldon Schorr, the president of Parkway, was a leader in the crafting of advertorials and placed hundreds a year in scores of periodicals, especially magazines, utilizing quotes, brand references and trade enhancement, "meant to compliment a company or persons' brand passively and more affordably than any other form of editorial content with much greater success than a press release". Historically, advertorials were less frowned upon and newspapers would even "show how magazine advertising is serving the public".&lt;ref&gt;See foot note in: {{cite news |title=The Making of a Cleanly Nation |url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n50/mode/1up |newspaper=The Independent |date=Jul 6, 1914 |accessdate=August 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
Advertorials on television are longer than typical [[television advertisements]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3Vi0RyXc5wC&amp;pg=PA279|title=The Entertainment Industry: An Introduction|last=Moss|first=Stuart|date=2010|publisher=CABI|year=|isbn=9781845935511|location=|pages=279|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are usually played on cable and satellite channels, which are less expensive than broadcast television.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They may include a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or story line to increase the entertainment value for viewers, and thus hold their attention longer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Daytime programs featuring light talk designed to draw in mainly a female audience often use advertorial segments which feature presentations of products, services, and packages by businesses. A representative of a business will have a discussion with a regular host, along with perhaps making a special offer for viewers.

===Australia===
In Australia, daytime programs featuring light talk and advertorials have been in television schedules since the late 1960s. One of the first was ''[[Good Morning Melbourne]]'' starring Roy Hampson and Annette Allison which began in 1967 followed by ''[[Good Morning Sydney]]'' in 1978, hosted by Maureen Duvall. [[Nine Network]] produced similar shows like ''In Sydney Today'' and ''In Melbourne Today'', later merged into ''Ernie and Denise'' in 1994. They were followed by a national program which began in 1992 on [[Network Ten]] called [[GMA with Bert Newton|Good Morning Australia]] (formerly The Morning Show) with Bert Newton. This success of that show prompted the [[Nine Network]] to launch a competing program in 2002 presented by [[Kerri-Anne Kennerley]] titled ''[[Mornings with Kerri-Anne]]'', later shortened to ''Kerri-Anne''. The Seven Network followed suit with a show starring [[Denise Drysdale]] called ''Denise'' before the debut of ''[[The Morning Show (TV program)|The Morning Show]]'' in 2007. Network Ten had ''[[9am with David &amp; Kim]]'' from 2006 which was replaced by ''[[The Circle (TV program)|The Circle]]'' in 2010. In November 2011, Nine Network cancelled Kerri Anne which was replaced by a new program titled 'Mornings' which premiered in 2012 presented by [[Sonia Kruger]] and [[David Campbell (Australian musician)|David Campbell]]. It was later rebranded as [[Today Extra]] which mean't the show was tied closer to Nine's breakfast news program [[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]].
These programs feature a traditional daytime show format of light talk, health, beauty, fashion and recipe segments along with advertorial segments scattered throughout the show. The advertorials are usually hosted by regular advertorial hosts who interact with business representatives. The main hosts of the show usually do not interact with the advertorial hosts or the business representatives. Advertorials are regulated under the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, which has been registered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority.

===India===
In India, the nexus between cable television companies, popular news papers and political parties came to the fore front in a 2011 documentary made by [[Prasar Bharati]] which revealed that the ownership of seven of the ten largest media companies in India was connected to some political party or the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The open frame - an informative documentary on Indian media |url=http://prasarbharati.org/index.php |website=prasarbharati.org |publisher=Public service broadcasting trust and Prasaar Bharati |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was given further credence to reports on [[Paid news in India|paid news]] that appeared in 2015-18 in selected Indian news papers and channels connecting the dark links between the two largest political parties BJP and Congress, black money and payments made to media channels to paint them in a better light. In 2018, a sting operation nicknamed "Cobrabost 136" by [[Cobrapost]], an Indian investigative journalism agency showed videos of meetings held with the 15 largest media companies, who agreed to publish / telecast communally and politically motivated and misleading information as a campaign in return for payments, routed through advertising and PR companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Media companies in India - cobrapost sting 136 |url=https://cobrapost.com/blog/Hindustan%20Times |accessdate=5 June 2018 |publisher=Cobrapost |date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, locally produced daytime television rose in the mid-2000s as local television stations (especially those with the [[NBC]] and [[Fox Networks]], where NBC gave up the most programming time) saw network time on [[daytime television|weekday mornings after 9am]] returned to local control and saw new national talk shows either fail or not attract the right [[demographic]] to a timeslot. Beginning with ''Daytime'' on [[Media General]] station [[WFLA-TV]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] in the early 2000s, a new format featuring the structure of a traditional locally produced daytime show with the usual format of light talk, health features, beauty tips and recipe segments which was popular up to the early 1990s (when expansion of newscasts became a much less expensive, more dependable form of revenue) came into use. Some of these shows, such as [[WKBW-TV]]'s ''[[AM Buffalo]]'' in [[Buffalo, New York]], seamlessly made the transition from a traditional local talk show to a paid program with little notice.

This type of program usually features light talk designed to draw in mainly a female audience, and then presentation of products, services, and packages by local businesses; for example a basement waterproofing system might be discussed by the representative of a company in that business with the hosts, along with perhaps a special offer for viewers.

In U.S. newspapers, for example, [[ExxonMobil]] purchased an advertorial on ''[[The New York Times]]'' op-ed page every Thursday between 1972 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Geoffrey |last1=Supran |first2=Naomi |last2=Oreskes |authorlink2=Naomi Oreskes |title=Assessing ExxonMobil's climate change communications (1977–2014) |year=2017 |journal=[[Environmental Research Letters]] |volume=12 |number=8 |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/aa815f |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa815f}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=w5g1nPfXOIA|title=Academic study concludes Exxon Mobil misled on climate change}} August 23, 2017 [[PBS NewsHour]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/scientific-study-concludes-exxon-mobil-misled-climate-change/ |title=Academic study concludes Exxon Mobil misled on climate change (with transcript) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=August 23, 2017 |website=PBS NewsHour |access-date=August 28, 2017 |quote=And yet, 15 years after that study was released in “The New York Times,” Exxon released an advertorial saying [[Climate change skeptic|unsettled science]] was the rule of the day, and it quoted data from other studies which seemed to suggest it was natural fluctuations. The authors of that study said it was extremely misleading.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
On radio, advertorials can feature discussions between an announcer or a DJ and the representative of a business. The discussion may feature testimonials from customers or a personal endorsement from the announcer. The products featured can range from mobile phone/cable/satellite providers, insurance, financing, auto servicing, travel agencies, and upcoming concerts or music releases.

===Australia===
The "[[cash for comment affair]]" was an Australian scandal that broke in 1999, concerning paid advertising in radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary.

==Legal issues==
In the United Kingdom, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] requires advertorials to be clearly marked as such. In one case, the Scottish newspaper ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' published a feature titled "Professional Brief" that had been submitted by Glasgow-based French Duncan Chartered Accountants. According to a complaint, it did not clearly indicate that it was a paid advertisement. The newspaper argued that, because it was a "sponsored column" and it was indicated that the opinions expressed were those of the author, it did not have to refer to it as an advertisement. The ASA responded that, because payment was given in exchange for the publication of the columns and because the content was provided by the marketers rather than the newspaper, they considered the columns advertisements and required that they indicate as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-4853|title=Advertorials must be clearly identified|date=Jan 9, 2007|publisher=[[Out-Law.com]]|accessdate=2009-01-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090207072448/http://www.out-law.com/page-4853| archivedate= 7 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For magazines in the United States mailed at the publication rate, the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] has regulations as to how to mark editorial and advertising. [[Domestic Mail Manual]] states that under 18 USC 1734, "if a valuable consideration is paid, accepted, or promised for the publication of any editorial or other reading matter in a Periodicals publication, that matter must be plainly marked 'advertisement' by the publisher. When a single item of paid editorial or other reading matter occupies more than one page, it need only be marked 'advertisement' on the first page. The word "advertisement" may be included in a statement that explains why the material is marked 'advertisement.' Such a statement must be prominent on the first page of the material and the word 'advertisement' in the statement must be in bold or italicized print or otherwise emphasized so that it can be plainly seen. Editors or publishers who print such matter without plainly marking it 'advertisement' are subject to a fine of not more than $500."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/707.htm#1299866 "DMM 707 Periodicals"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407185820/http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/707.htm#1299866 |date=April 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''alt.sex''' is a [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] – a discussion group within the Usenet network – relating to [[human sexual activity]]. It was popular in the 1990s. An October 1993 survey by Brian Reid reported an estimated worldwide readership for the &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex&lt;/tt&gt; newsgroup of 3.3 million, that being 8% of the total Usenet readership, with 67% of all Usenet "nodes" (news servers users log in to access the system) carrying the group. At that time, &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex&lt;/tt&gt; had an estimated traffic of 2,300 messages per month.&lt;ref name=Shade&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures of Internet|editor=Rob Shields|chapter=Is there Free Speech on the Net? Censorship in the Global Information Infrastructure|author=Leslie Regan Shade|pages=13&amp;ndash;17|year=1996|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=0-8039-8805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newsgroup hierarchy below &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex&lt;/tt&gt; comprises several newsgroups, including &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.stories&lt;/tt&gt; (which is the biggest newsgroup in the hierarchy after &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex&lt;/tt&gt; itself), &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.pictures&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.blondes&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.bondage&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.bestiality&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.rape&lt;/tt&gt;. The former four newsgroups generally feature text and images similar to the type that can be found in mainstream adult magazines, such as ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' or ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.  The latter three newsgroups exemplify a set of sub-groups that deals in more "extreme" or less socially accepted topics. Other sub-groups include some with intentionally humorous names, such as &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.aluminum.baseball.bat&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.boredom&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.bestiality.hamster.duct-tape&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name=Shade /&gt; There are more newsgroups on the less mainstream topics or sub-cultures, although as of 1998 they were generally far lower in traffic than those that deal in the more mainstream sexual behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Internet and the First Amendment: Schools and Sexually Explicit Expression|author=Fred H. Cate|pages=17|year=1998|publisher=Phi Delta Kappa International|isbn=0-87367-398-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1993 analysis of the &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex&lt;/tt&gt; hierarchy, Maureen Furniss concluded that "sexually oriented boards act as a kind of support group for people who post notices to them, especially individuals whose sexual orientations are very marginalized (those who practice sadomasochism or bestiality, for example)."&lt;ref name=Shade /&gt;

The [[University of Waterloo]] in 1994 ceased carrying &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex-bondage&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.bestiality&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex-stories&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex-stories.d&lt;/tt&gt; upon the recommendation of its ethics committee, which had expressed concerns that the content of those newsgroups may have violated the Canadian [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]].&lt;ref name=Shade /&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.cancel&lt;/tt&gt; is a Usenet newsgroup set up specifically to help combat [[newsgroup spam]] [[crossposting|cross-posted]] to the entire alt.sex hierarchy.  The newsgroup is a simple "[[spamtrap]]" – a trap used to collect samples of unsolicited messages that can then be acted on by an automated anti-spam system. According to its [[newsgroup charter|charter]], any message posted to &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex.cancel&lt;/tt&gt; may be [[cancel message|cancelled]] automatically.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The well-known mass-mailing [[macro virus| macro computer virus]] called the "[[Melissa virus]]" was originally distributed via the &lt;tt&gt;alt.sex&lt;/tt&gt; newsgroup. It was hidden inside a list purporting to contain passwords to pornographic websites. The messages containing the virus were posted with message headers claiming that the post had been written using the [[AOL|America Online]] (AOL) account of Scott Steinmetz, whose username was "skyroket". Kizza reports that the headers on the post were probably forged by Melissa's author, [[Melissa_(computer_virus)#David_L._Smith|David L. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Computer Network Security|author=Joseph Migga Kizza|pages=87|year=2005|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-20473-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amsterdam sex crimes case''' ({{lang-nl|Amsterdamse zedenzaak}}) is a court case involving Robert Mikelson's abuse of babies in [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]].

==Identification and arrest==
The case of convicted sex offender Robert Mikelson started in December 2010 with the broadcast in the Netherlands on the television show ''Opsporing Verzocht'' ("Investigation Requested") of images originating from the United States.&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=13 December 2010|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2010/12/babysitter_abused_filmed_up_to.php|title='Babysitter abused, filmed up to 50 young children in Amsterdam'|work=DutchNews.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Mikelson and an unnamed child with a [[stuffed toy]] known as [[Miffy]] ({{lang-nl|Nijntje}}). As Miffy is originally a Dutch product, the investigators suspected the child to be Dutch. After the boy's grandfather realized the boy was his grandson, the police were directed to the child's [[Babysitter|sitter]], Robert Mikelson.&lt;ref name="Nijntje"&gt;{{cite news|language = Dutch|accessdate = 17 April 2012|date = 13 December 2010|url = http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/3322/Misbruik-in-Amsterdamse-creches/article/detail/1911039/2010/12/13/Nijntje-knuffel-leidde-politie-naar-Robert-Mikelson.dhtml|title = Nijntje-knuffel leidde politie naar Robert Mikelson |author = Suzanne Borgdorff|work = [[Algemeen Dagblad|AD]]|trans-title = Stuffed toy "Miffy" pointed police to Robert Mikelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a search of his house, computers containing a large collection of child pornography (46,803 photos and 3,672 movies, part of which had been unsuccessfully deleted during the broadcast)&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; were found and seized,&lt;ref name=NOSSpreekrecht&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=12 March 2012|title=Behoud spreekrecht in zedenzaak|work=[[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]]|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/350680-behoud-spreekrecht-in-zedenzaak.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in

==Defendants==
Roberts Miķelsons (in the Netherlands generally referred to as Robert M.&lt;ref name=BNRWraking/&gt;&lt;ref name=NieuwsUurCurtains/&gt;) (born in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]], 14 September 1983) became a naturalized Dutch citizen in 2008. He was convicted of possession of [[German porn|child pornography in Germany]] in 2003 while working at a daycare facility in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name=Heidelberg&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch |accessdate=17 April 2012 |date=16 December 2010 |url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/parliament-shocked-about-earlier-conviction-robert-mikelsons |title=Parliament shocked by earlier conviction Robert Mikelsons |work=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830094917/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/parliament-shocked-about-earlier-conviction-robert-mikelsons |archivedate=30 August 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he married Richard van O.. From 2007 to 2009, he worked at several daycare centres of "het Hofnarretje" group, and from 2009 to 2010, at "Jenno's Knuffelparadijs".&lt;ref name=DirecteurHofnarretje&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=13 December 2010|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4204/Zedenzaak-kinderdagverblijven/article/detail/1072173/2010/12/13/Directeur-Het-Hofnarretje-is-verbijsterd.dhtml|title=Directeur Het Hofnarretje is verbijsterd (Director Het Hofnarretje is bewildered)|work=[[het Parool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to evaluations of the [[Pieter Baan Centre]], a forensic psychiatric observation clinic, M. is a [[hypersexuality|hypersexual]] [[pedophile]] with a [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=VKTBS&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=25 November 2011|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/4244/Kindermisbruik/article/detail/3049946/2011/11/25/Langdurige-tbs-Robert-M-noodzakelijk.dhtml|title='Langdurige tbs Robert M. noodzakelijk' ('Long term involuntary commitment Robert M. necessary')|work=[[de Volkskrant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard van O.&lt;ref name=ElsevierWraking/&gt; (referred to as Richard van O.&lt;ref name=BNRWraking/&gt;&lt;ref name=NieuwsUurCurtains/&gt;), is accused of possession of child pornography as well as sexual assault on an 11-16-year-old boy, both of which he was acquitted. He is charged with being an accessory to the crimes of Robert M.&lt;ref name=NieuwsUurCurtains/&gt;

==Victims==
M confessed to the abuse of 83 young children, but he is charged with abuse of 67 because some of the parents preferred to keep their children out of the court records owing to privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/amsterdam-child-sex-abuse-victims-demand-damages|title=Amsterdam child sex abuse victims demand damages |date=2 April 2012|work=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest of these children was 19 days old at the time the acts were committed.&lt;ref name=19Days&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=19 March 2012|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/3322/Misbruik-in-Amsterdamse-creches/article/detail/3227776/2012/03/19/Jongste-slachtoffer-Robert-M-was-19-dagen-oud.dhtml|title=Jongste slachtoffer Robert M. was 19 dagen oud|author=Suzanne Borgdorff|work=[[Algemeen Dagblad|AD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuse took place at the child care facilities where M. worked, at the homes of the children he babysat, and at M. and Van O's home. M. admitted abusing the children and suggested, according to media reports, that more children might have been involved. According to the prosecution ({{lang-nl|Openbaar Ministerie}}), M. carefully scouted his babysitting addresses for presence of heavy curtains and absence of [[nanny cam]]s. He stopped the abuse when the children started to be able to talk.&lt;ref name=NieuwsUurCurtains&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch |accessdate=17 April 2012 |date=5 April 2012 |url=http://nieuwsuur.nl/onderwerp/359282-eis-tegen-robert-m-20-jaar-en-tbs.html |title=Eis tegen Robert M.: 20 jaar en tbs (Charge against Robert M.: 20 years and involuntary commitment]) |work=[[Nieuwsuur]] |author=Gert Janssen and Jan van Loenen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408232050/http://nieuwsuur.nl/onderwerp/359282-eis-tegen-robert-m-20-jaar-en-tbs.html |archivedate=8 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The trial started on 12 March 2012&lt;ref name=VKTBS/&gt; in the Court of Amsterdam ({{lang-nl|Rechtbank Amsterdam}}), a Dutch [[court of first instance]]. It took place at "de Bunker", a strongly defended courtroom in [[Amsterdam Nieuw-West]].&lt;ref name=ParoolJudges&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=6 March 2012|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4204/ZEDENZAAK-KINDERDAGVERBLIJVEN/article/detail/3220062/2012/03/06/Slachtoffer-in-zedenzaak-boven-alles.dhtml|title=Slachtoffer in zedenzaak boven alles|work=[[het Parool]]|author=Hanneloes Pen}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the preliminary motions the parents of the children were granted the right to speak during the trial (a right normally only granted to direct victims), a decision which was challenged by M.' attorneys. Upon the granting of the right to speak, his lawyers ([[Wim Anker]]&lt;ref name=Nieuws/&gt; and Tjalling van der Goot)&lt;ref name=VKTBS/&gt; requested [[Substitution (law)|substitution]] ({{lang-nl|wraking}}) of the three judges, which was denied.&lt;ref name=ElsevierWraking/&gt;&lt;ref name="BNRWraking"&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch |accessdate=17 April 2012 |date=14 March 2012 |url=http://www.bnr.nl/programma/juridischezaken/515650-1203/wrakingsverzoek-robert-m.-afgewezen |author=Pieter van den Akker |title=Wrakingsverzoek Robert M. afgewezen |work=[[BNR Nieuwsradio|BNR]] |trans-title=Substitution request Robert M. denied |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418142139/http://www.bnr.nl/programma/juridischezaken/515650-1203/wrakingsverzoek-robert-m.-afgewezen |archivedate=18 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Openbaar Ministerie|prosecution]] demanded a sentence of 20 years' imprisonment,&lt;ref name=StarTrib&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=26 April 2012 |date=5 April 2012 |url=http://www.startribune.com/world/146286765.html |title=Dutch prosecutors demand 20-year sentence for man accused of molesting dozens of minors |work=[[Star Tribune]] }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by [[Terbeschikkingstelling|Involuntary commitment]] ({{lang-nl|TBS: Ter beschikkingstelling van de Staat}}) for M. and 12 years for Van O.&lt;ref name=NieuwsUurCurtains/&gt; The TBS charge was based on a psychiatric report from the [[Pieter Baan Centre]]. The report was based solely on observation of his behaviour in prison, as M. had refused to cooperate with a psychiatric evaluation.&lt;ref name=VKTBS/&gt; According to the prosecution M. was "cold, calculating, refined and proud of his actions".&lt;ref name=StarTrib/&gt; Although M. pleaded guilty to the abuse, the defense demanded "almost full acquittal", stating that the [[search warrant]] for M. and Van O.'s house (and thus the photo and video evidence from the computers) had not been obtained correctly.&lt;ref name=Telegraaf&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=16 April 2012|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/11922103/___Huis_onterecht_doorzocht___.html|title=Bijna volledige vrijspraak Robert M. gevraagd (Almost full acquittal requested)|work=[[de Telegraaf]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 20 April 2012, the hearings ended with the "last word" of the defendants (as is customary in Dutch criminal law). M. indicated that he was sorry about his acts and that he should have done more to prevent his acts from happening:&lt;ref name=Decision&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=20 April 2012|work=De Volkskrant|language=Dutch|title=Robert M. in laatste woord: 'Ik had er eigenlijk niet mogen zijn' (Robert M. in last word: I shouldn't have existed)|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/224/BINNENLAND/article/detail/3243877/2012/04/20/Robert-M-in-laatste-woord-Ik-had-er-eigenlijk-niet-mogen-zijn.dhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Ik had meer moeten doen. U hebt gelijk, ik had de perfecte mens moeten zijn, want alleen dan had ik deze tragedie kunnen voorkomen.&lt;br&gt;(English: "I should have done more. You are right, I should have been the perfect man, because only then could I have prevented this tragedy").}}

==Judgement in First Instance==
The judgement was given on 21 May 2012. M. was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment, followed by involuntary commitment, while Van O. was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name=sentenceNUNL&gt;{{cite news|work=nu.nl|title=Robert M. krijgt 18 jaar cel en tbs |trans-title=Robert M. gets 18 years imprisonment and involuntary commitment)|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2815182/robert-m-krijgt-18-jaar-cel-en-tbs.html|accessdate=21 May 2012|date=21 May 2012|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The search of the house of the defendants (in which the photographic evidence was seized) was deemed admissible and the judges considered the psychiatric evaluation in which M. was [[diminished responsibility]] asserted (a requirement for involuntary commitment) reliable. The diminished responsibility nor his cooperation during the investigation did not result in a lower sentence, due to the nature and level of organization of his crimes.&lt;ref name=sentenceNUNL/&gt; Upon hearing this part of the sentence, M. threw a glass of water at the judge.&lt;ref name=sentenceNUNL/&gt;

M. and Van O. were further sentenced to payment of a fine of in total €467,000 euro and  €365,000 respectively to the children. Further claims (for material damages to the parents) were deemed "too complicated" to be treated in a criminal court case, but could be claimed in a [[civil lawsuit]].&lt;ref name=sentenceNUNL/&gt; Non-payment will add 8 days imprisonment per child for M. and Van O.

==Appeal==
M.s and Van O. [[appeal]]ed the judgement, which triggered the prosecution to appeal as well (a so-called "vervolg appel") in order to have more possibilities before the [[appellate court]].&lt;ref name=ElsevierAppeal&gt;{{cite news|work=Elsevier |title=Pedofiel Robert Mikelsons gaat in hoger beroep (Pedophile Robert Mikelsons appeals) |url=http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Nieuws/Nederland/340106/Pedofiel-Robert-Mikelsons-gaat-in-hoger-beroep.htm |accessdate=31 May 2012 |date=31 May 2012 |language=Dutch }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/2825045/in-hoger-beroep-richard-van-o.html|title=OM ook in hoger beroep tegen Richard van O.|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012|work=nu.nl|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start of the appeal took place on 15 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/4204/ZEDENZAAK-KINDERDAGVERBLIJVEN/article/detail/3288349/2012/07/18/Behandeling-zedenzaak-wordt-voortgezet-in-november.dhtml|title=Behandeling zedenzaak wordt voortgezet in november|work=Novum|date=18 July 2012|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges decided to allow a second psychological evaluation center Oldenkotte in [[Rekken]]  on the request of Robert M., who indicated his willingness to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2012/11_november/15/binnenland/nieuw_psychisch_onderzoek_naar_robert_m.xml |title=Nieuw psychisch onderzoek naar Robert M |publisher=RTL Nieuws |date=2012-11-15 |accessdate=2012-11-17 |language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parents also had the possibility to speak during the trial, as a new law making this right explicit had in the mean time entered into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=door Jules Seegers |url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2012/11/15/eerste-zitting-hoger-beroep-robert-m-in-amsterdamse-zedenzaak/ |title=Eerste zitting hoger beroep Robert M. in Amsterdamse zedenzaak |publisher=nrc.nl |date=2012-11-15 |language=Dutch |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cassation==
M. appealed the judgement to the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] (Hoge Raad) in a [[cassation]] procedure, in which he is represented by Dirk Daamen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nu.nl/binnenland/3493943/robert-m-zet-cassatie.html|title=Robert M. zet cassette door|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=6 Jun 2013|work=[[Nu.nl]]|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hoge Raad dismissed the appeal,&lt;ref name=RechtspraakCassatie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:HR:2014:2668|title=Decision Hoge Raad, nr ECLI:NL:HR:2014:2668|date=19 September 2014|work=rechtspraak.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; in conformation with the advice of its [[Advocate-General]].&lt;ref name=RechspraakAG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:PHR:2014:632|title=Advice Advocate General to Hoge Raad, nr ECLI:NL:PHR:2014:632|date=19 September 2014|work=rechtspraak.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the length of the procedure before the Supreme Court, which lasted over 16 months, the length of the sentence was reduced by one month to 18 years and 11 months.&lt;ref name=RechtspraakCassatie/&gt;

The public in the Netherlands was shocked when the events surfaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 April 2012|date=13 December 2010|work=[[Hart van Nederland]]|url=http://www.hartvannederland.nl/nederland/noord-holland/2010/nederland-geschokt-door-ontucht-trio/|title=Nederland geschokt door ontucht-trio (Netherlands shocked by sex crimes trio)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The public prosecution also stated during the case that the events shocked Dutch society and that it would therefore not be justified to request a lesser sentence than the 20 years demanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 April 2012|date=5 April 2012|work=NRC|title=OM eist twintig jaar cel en tbs voor Robert M.

==Worldwide arrests==
According to the Amsterdam police, the investigation of leads found on M. computer has led, worldwide, to the arrests of 43 suspected child molesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arrests in major international child porn investigation |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/arrests-in-major-international-child-porn-investigation/2012/08/04/262afb7e-de41-11e1-8ad1-909913931f71_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=4 August 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early [[Asian American|Asian settler]]s to the [[United States]] went to [[Hawaii]]. Most of these early immigrants moved to the islands as laborers to work on the pineapple, coconut, and sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s. These early migrants have tended to stay, although a handful returned to their home countries. There has also been recent immigration to Hawaii from more ethnic Asian groups, including the [[Thai American|Thai]], [[Indonesian American|Indonesian]], and the [[Vietnamese American|Vietnamese]].

==Filipinos==
{{Main|Filipinos in Hawaii}}

Filipinos, like most other [[East Asian]] immigrants to Hawaii, worked on the sugar plantations. In [[2010 United States census|2010]], Filipinos surpassed Japanese as the largest ethnic group. At the time of the [[2000 United States census|2000 census]], they were the third largest ethnic group in the islands.

==Japanese==
{{Main|Japanese in Hawaii}}

Until 2010, people of Japanese ancestry made up the majority of Hawaii's population. After the breakout of World War II, 
More than 110,000 Japanese Americans in the mainland U.S., who mostly lived on the West Coast, were forced into internment camps. However, in Hawai'i, where 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were also interned.&lt;ref&gt;Ogawa, Dennis M. and Fox, Jr., Evarts C. Japanese Americans, from Relocation to Redress. 1991, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean==
{{Main|Korean immigration to Hawaii}}

Koreans mainly came to [[Hawaii|the islands]] to work on the [[pineapple]] and [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|sugar plantations]], but a few, including the family of [[Mary Paik Lee]], came to the mainland (usually [[California]]) after experiencing extreme discrimination.

==Chinese==
{{Main|Chinese immigration to Hawaii}}

The Chinese discovered the Hawaiian islands in 1778; the same year as English explorer [[James Cook]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}. A few also came to the islands among the crew of James Cook. Today, some Chinese born on the islands can claim to be seventh generation.

==Indians==

People of Indian origin did not come to Hawaii in sizable numbers, and those who did did not stay for long. Many early [[Indian American|Indian immigrants]] stopped in Hawaii only to make enough money to sail on to the mainland anywhere from the mid to late 1800's to the 1900s.

A notable Indian in Hawaii was Dalip Singh Saund, who on September 13, 1910, arrived in [[Honolulu]] from his home village in [[Punjab, British India|Punjab]], [[India]] at the age of 14. He labored in the sugarcane fields for about two months to earn enough money to continue on to California. On November 18, 1910, he arrived on [[United States Immigration Station, Angel Island|Angel Island]]. At one point, Saund was the nation's largest [[celery]] grower.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21235">The '''Black Power Movement in Montreal''' in the 1960s was a period of rediscovering black identity through a process of invoking cultural, economic, and political thought amongst blacks. The eruption of political activism during [[Montreal|Montreal's]] [[Quiet Revolution]] as well as the reformation of immigration policies which discriminated against non-white immigrants allowed black communities to publicly express and bring awareness to their struggles with racism. The movement was an integral component of the emerging global challenges to [[imperialism]] during the 1960s and it stemmed from various movements including [[Garveyism]], [[pan-Africanism]], the [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Rastafari]], and others. Montreal's Black Power movement culminated in the aftermath of the [[Sir George Williams affair|Sir George Williams Affair]]—a student occupation that resulted in an estimated $2 million worth of damages and 97 arrests—which raised concerns of racism worldwide.

== Background ==

During the early 20th century, Montreal blacks primarily lived in the [[Saint Antoine Street|Saint Antoine]] district, where they were socially excluded and later on evicted to facilitate urban development, forcing them to disperse to other regions of Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moishistoiredesnoirs.com/en/about-us/a-bit-about-the-history-of-montreal-blacks/|title=A bit about the history of Montreal Blacks {{!}} Mois histoire des Noirs|website=moishistoiredesnoirs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural racism was prevalent during the turn of the century and prevented Montreal blacks from obtaining respectable work or adequate housing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Empire Within: Postcolonial Thought and Political Activism in Sixties Montreal|last=Mills|first=Sean|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780773536951|location=|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montreal's black community fought racial discrimination through the creation of various social groups such as the [[Union United Church|Union United Church (UUC)]] and the Negro Community Centre (NCC) in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.urbexplayground.com/urbex/negro-community-center|title=The Negro Community Center|last=Jarold|date=2014-03-17|work=Urbex playground|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UUC was originally called the Union Congregational Church of Montreal (UCCM). Founded by American-born railway porters in 1907, the UCCM was a response to the racial discrimination the railway porters had faced at White churches. The UCCM provided the Black community with a space to worship freely without discrimination, and in 1925 the name was changed to the UUC. Led by Reverend Charles Este, the UUC sought to improve the social conditions for the black community through leadership and development. In 1927, clergy members of the UUC founded the NCC, a charitable organisation that also sought to improve the social conditions for the black community. The NCC became a staple in Montreal's black community and contributed to the fight against racial discrimination by promoting black employment, hosting educational programs, and looking after the youth in the black community.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=“A Microcosm of the General Struggle”: Black Thought and Activism in Montreal, 1960–1969|last=Hebert|first=Paul|publisher=University of Michigan|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Canadian government's removal of exclusionary immigration policies in the 1950s-1960s, which favoured non-white immigrants, Montreal's black population began to grow. This led to a large migration of West Indian and African blacks to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/collection/black-history-in-canada/|title=Black History in Canada - The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These immigrants often came with job skills that advanced the economic standards for Montreal's black population. Despite these advancements, issues of racism and resistance from the black community against these issues persisted. Also, the internationally broadening language of [[dissent]] towards [[colonization]] during the 1960s sparked an increased sense of activism among black intellectuals because it was seen as an opportunity to be heard.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/cunews/main/stories/2014/02/19/50-years-in-the-fightforracialequality.html|title=50 years in the fight for racial equality|website=www.concordia.ca|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increased activism was rooted in the idea of [[Black Power]], a slogan coined by [[Stokely Carmichael]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; During this period, a larger scale [[Black Power movement]] was also occurring in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of the African and the African American|last=Appiah|first=Anthony|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York|pages=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black intellectuals in Montreal drew from the analyses of race and imperialism formulated by black intellectuals in the United States. The ideas of [[Malcolm X]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther king]], and [[Stokely Carmichael]] inspired the Black Power movement in Montreal and the [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination of Martin Luther King]] sparked protest in Montreal.&lt;ref name=fear&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fear of a Black Nation|last=David|first=Austin|publisher=Between the Lines|year=2013|isbn=9781771130110|location=Toronto|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locally in Montreal, many social groups expressing anti-colonial and anti-imperialist ideas formed during the Quiet Revolution. Among these groups were French Canadians, feminist groups, and workers rights groups. These various groups contributed to and borrowed from the circulating language of dissent in Montreal as well as internationally during this period. Montreal's Black Power Movement was one of the actors in the Quiet Revolution and the struggles experienced by blacks resonated with other groups during the time.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; Internationally, Montreal's Black Power movement was inspired by third world liberation struggles. The liberation of India in 1947, Ghana and Malaya in 1957, and Algeria from French colonialism in 1962 inspired anti-colonial ideas in Montreal. Also, The Cuban revolution inspired anti-colonial ideas in Montreal because Cuba's dissolution of trading ties with the United States demonstrated that a small nation could stand against a large imperial power. Black intellectuals linked institutional racism to imperial oppression and the Cuban revolution symbolized freedom from this oppression.&lt;ref name=fear/&gt;

== Montreal in the 1960s ==

=== Negro Citizenship Association ===
The Negro Citizenship Association (NCA) was founded in 1951 by Donald William Moore.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The NCA was a civil rights organisation that initially opposed Canada's exclusionary immigration policies which favoured non-white immigrants.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/accountability-operations-customer-service/access-city-information-or-records/city-of-toronto-archives/whats-online/web-exhibits/caribbean-connection-one-mans-crusade/|title=Caribbean Connection: One Man's Crusade|last=Toronto|first=City of|date=2017-11-23|work=City of Toronto|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], Britain encouraged Caribbean immigration to aid post-war recovery, however this inflow was restricted in the 1950s. Britain's tightening of immigration policies resulted in the Caribbean government urging Canada to allow Caribbean immigrants into the country.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The NCA worked with the Caribbean government to publicly reveal and change Canada's exclusionary immigration policies. This united effort led to the West Indian Domestic scheme, which provided Caribbean females with the opportunity to apply for temporary or permanent residency in Canada after a year of domestic work.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Austin|date=Fall 2007|title=ALL ROADS LED TO MONTREAL: BLACK POWER, THE CARIBBEAN, THE BLACK RADICAL TRADITION IN CANADA.|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=f021b291-22e4-439c-9ced-51c88cbc79c1%40pdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=28323812&amp;db=ahl|journal=Journal of African American History|volume=92|pages=516–539|via=Western Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's exclusionary immigration policy continued to unravel and eventually became a point system in the [[Immigration Act, 1976|Immigration Act, 1967]].&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; By the 1960s, black activism was becoming more vocal in Montreal and the black community was beginning to take a stronger stand against racism.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; The influx of Caribbean students following the shift in immigration policies introduced anti-colonial ideas into Montreal's black community. These new ideas sometimes clashed with the more civil ideas of the established black community. By 1965, the NCA was beginning to take action against racism through their journal ''Expression.'' ''Expression'' typically published controversial, assertive articles advocating for the black community and denouncing racism. ''Expression'' also sought a strengthening of anti-discrimination legislation in Montreal. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968, ''Expression'' published an article advocating for violence in black activism onwards.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

=== Caribbean Conference Committee ===
The Caribbean Conference Committee (CCC) was formed in 1965 by a group of Caribbean immigrants who sought to provide a platform for intellectuals to discuss anti-colonial ideas and formulate political as well as social change.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sir-george-williams-affair/|title=Sir George Williams Affair|last=Lambert|first=Maude-Emmanuelle|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Caribbean immigrants intended to return to the Caribbean and become politically active after earning an education, funds, or both in Canada. The common aspiration to fight colonialism in the Caribbean inspired a group of Caribbean men and women to form the CCC. Among this group were [[Alphonso Theodore Roberts|Alfie Roberts]], [[Rosie Douglas]], and [[Anne Cools]]. The committee held multiple conferences that featured influential activists from around the globe such as [[George Lamming]] and [[C. L. R. James|C.L.R James]]. The committee discussed and formulated political and social change in the Caribbean, which consequently inspired ideas of change in the local setting of Montreal.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The Caribbean Conference Committee separated in 1967 when some members dispersed, however the name of the organisation was changed to the Canadian Conference Committee (CCC) which represented a shift in Caribbean focus to Canada as their home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144083837|title=The Blacks in Canada : a history|last=Winks|first=Robin|date=|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1971|isbn=0773516328|edition= 2nd|location=Montreal, Que.|pages=405|oclc=144083837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caribbean students became less concerned with Caribbean decolonization and more interested in domestic racial issues. In 1968, the assassination of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] resulted in a turn to radicalism for some black activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr-assassination|title=Martin Luther King Jr. Assassination - Black History - HISTORY.com|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; King advocated for unity amongst all races, however some black activists began to see violence and separation from Whites as the only solution to racial issues in the wake of his death, resulting in a shift to the Black Power movement. Montreal's black population voiced their rage through protests as well as two [[conference]]s.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The first conference was a three-day event from October 4 to 6, 1968, held at Sir George Williams University. The conference was organized by black activists seeking racial equality through civil means. Inspired by the Caribbean Conference Committee and titled the ''Black People in Canada Conference'', It addressed the local, daily concerns of Montreal's black population and featured [[Howard McCurdy]], a professor at the University of Windsor, who emphasized the importance for blacks to understand their identity and have a voice.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The conference also sought to reconcile class divide and conflict amongst Montreal Blacks, particularly between the Caribbean immigrants and established black Canadians. The second conference was a four-day event from October 11 to 14, 1968, held at McGill and it was titled ''The Congress of Black Writers''. The most prominent speech at this event was [[Stokely Carmichael|Stokely Carmichael's]], which amassed a crowd of over 2000 people and was centered around [[Black Power]] as well as the idea that blacks should liberate themselves internationally through revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bscportal.wordpress.com/history-of-conferences-in-the-black-community-of-montreal/|title=History of Conferences in the Black Community of Montreal|date=2015-08-30|work=BLACK STUDIES CENTER PORTAL|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmichael asserted that revolution was necessary to rebuild the social system that had previously oppressed blacks internationally through [[slavery]] and [[colonization]]. The majority of the attendance at this second committee was of a younger demographic and the radical ideas expressed conflicted with the more civil ideas of the ''Black People in Canada Conference''.&lt;ref name=fear/&gt;

=== Sir George Williams Affair ===
{{main|Sir George Williams Affair}}
Montreal's Black Power Movement culminated with the [[Sir George Williams affair|Sir George Williams Affair]] which ended on February 11, 1969. In response to the [[Sir George Williams University|Sir George William's University]] committee's failure to act on six accusations of racially prejudiced grading against Professor Perry Anderson, roughly 200 demonstrators—mostly White—peacefully occupied the computer centre at the school. After 14 days, negotiations went astray and the [[Occupation (protest)|occupation]] ended in a fire, roughly $2 million in damages and 97 arrests.&lt;ref name=:4/&gt; The student occupation was the manifestation of the [[Black Power]] movement in Montreal and an international display of the daily adversities and discrimination faced by the black community. Among the occupants arrested were [[Rosie Douglas]] and [[Anne Cools]], who were seen as the leaders of the occupation by authorities.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; Other occupants lost employment opportunities in Canada, and some had to migrate back to the Caribbean without completing their education.&lt;ref name=fear/&gt; While the fire occurred, some White spectators chanted "Let the niggers burn."&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; In a 1971 McGill Free Press article, [[Tim Hector]] denounced the priority given to the damaged computers over the students lives. Nonetheless, Hector also recognized the occupation as a declaration of black presence in Montreal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Austin|date=Fall 2007|title=ALL ROADS LED TO MONTREAL: BLACK POWER, THE CARIBBEAN, THE BLACK RADICAL TRADITION IN CANADA.|url=|journal=Journal of African American History|volume=92|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many Anglophone students refused to support the protestors after the computer damages the protestors began to receive support from some francophone groups. The [[Confédération des syndicats nationaux]] (CSN), Montreal's second largest labour union, criticized the media for focusing on the material losses of the occupation instead of the racial issues in Canada. Francophone intellectuals had previously neglected the black community in Montreal, however the events of the occupation changed their views on race in the city.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The Sir George Williams Affair brought the black community closer together and in October 1969, members of Montreal's black community occupied the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] during an [[African Studies Association]] (ASA) session with the Canadian African Studies Association. Many of these occupants had participated in the Sir George Williams Affair and they teamed up with the African Heritage Studies Association, founded by [[John Henrik Clarke]], to denounce the lack of Black representation within the ASA. This occupation was a demonstration of the increased militancy within the Black community sparked by the Sir George Williams Affair.&lt;ref name=fear/&gt; Also, the occupation inspired the creation of the Thursday Night Rally within the black community. The Thursday Night Rally was a weekly meeting initially created to discuss news concerning the arrests of the Sir George Williams Affair. The meetings grew and eventually became a platform for communal discussions on racism in Montreal. The meetings would often feature historian Roy States, screen films about the Black struggle, and discuss Africa as well as South America.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:TnT St. Augustine UWI Campus.jpg|thumb|The University of West Indies St. Augustine Campus, where Daniel Roland Michener was denied access following the Sir George Williams occupation. By Grueslayer - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=36254377&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Empire Within: Postcolonial Thought and Political Activism in Sixties Montreal|last=Mills|first=Sean|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The inaction of the university committee and the outcome of the Sir George Williams occupation publicly displayed the racial tensions in Canada. In Montreal, the Sir George Williams affair revealed the covert racism in Canadian society and brought the Black community closer together. Although francophone intellectuals had previously ignored Montreal's black population, they showed support for the black community after the events and denounced [[institutional racism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The events inspired black activists to begin challenging imperialism through the entire community rather than solely through the university system. New organizations were formed such as the [https://liguedesnoirs.org/en/ Black Coalition of Quebec], a Human Rights organization. The black community also created a controversial newspaper titled "Uhuru," which became a venue for black activism and recognized the colonization of blacks as well as other groups.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The events of the Sir George William occupation also sparked anger in the [[Caribbean]], where [[Roland Michener]] was denied entrance into the [[University of the West Indies]] on his "Good-will tour" in 1969.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The arrest of 10 Trinidadian students during the occupation sparked protest in the [[West Indies]], and the protests eventually transformed into demonstrations against the government and began a Black Power movement in [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="fear" /&gt; Following these events, Trinidad's local military nearly [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] the government.&lt;ref name="fear" /&gt; [[Alphonso Theodore Roberts|Alfie Roberts]], a black intellectual, believed the occupation affirmed the presence of blacks in Montreal and corresponded with the local [[Labor unrest|labour unrest]] of the 1960s&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Sir George Williams occupation triggered a Black Renaissance in Montreal and demonstrated the black communities refusal of continued discrimination.

== Criticisms ==
Similar to other social movements during the Quiet Revolution, Montreal's Black Power movement had its own contradictions. The Black Power movement drew on an idea of black [[masculinity]], which was [[militant]] and exclusionary.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; At ''The Congress of Black Writers,'' [[Stokely Carmichael]] advocated for political change through violence, which received mixed reactions from members of the black community. Also, the movement used gendered language which excluded women. Defined as a "struggle for manhood," the Black Power movement was a call to black men and ignored the role of women. Black women felt the movement was hypocritical and devalued them- some believing they were oppressed by black men just as black men were oppressed by Whites.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''CLEAPSS''' is an advisory service providing support in [[science]] and [[technology]] for a consortium of [[local authorities]] and their schools including establishments for pupils with [[special needs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CLEAPSS|url=http://www.cleapss.org.uk/about-cleapss|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Independent school]]s, post-16 colleges, teacher training establishments, curriculum developers and others can apply for associate membership. CLEAPSS offers help from nursery education through to A-level studies or equivalent.

CLEAPSS first started in 1963 as '''CLEAPSE''' (Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Equipment). In 1988 the name was changed to CLEAPSS ('''Consortium of Local Education Authorities for the Provision of Science Services''') to reflect a change of emphasis from equipment to a range of services. Since then, [[Local Education Authorities]] became Local Authorities (LAs) and CLEAPSS' services expanded to include [[D&amp;T]], so CLEAPSS was registered as a [[Trade Mark]]. CLEAPSS is now simply a name and not an acronym.

CLEAPSS is based at the [[Brunel University]] Science Park in [[Uxbridge]].

The '''Burmese census''' is an official count of the human population in [[Burma]] (Myanmar).

==History==
The earliest census on record in Burmese history was taken in 1359 in the [[Pinya Kingdom]]. The first nationwide census was taken in 1638, and it was followed by two other nationwide censuses in 1784 and 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Harvey | first=G.

It was carried out in 10-year intervals until 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President U Thein Sein attends the meeting to clarify country-wide census-taking (2014) process |url=http://m.president-office.gov.mm/en/?q=briefing-room/news/2013/08/02/id-2497 |accessdate=22 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061325/http://m.president-office.gov.mm/en/?q=briefing-room%2Fnews%2F2013%2F08%2F02%2Fid-2497 |archivedate=23 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-independence area, the census has been conducted 3 times, in 1973, 1983, and [[2014 Burma Census|2014]].

The '''Chichimeca Jonaz''' are an [[indigenous people of Mexico]], living in the states of [[Guanajuato]] and [[San Luis Potosí]]. In Guanajuato, the Chichimeca Jonaz people live in a community in San Luis de la Paz municipality. The settlement is 2,070 m above sea level. They call this place ''Rancho Úza'' or ''Misión Chichimeca''. They are descendants of the [[Pame people]], who fought in the [[Chichimeca War]] (1550-1590) in the Chichimeca Confederation.

In the 2000 General Census by INEGI 2,641 people named themselves as speakers of the [[Chichimeca Jonaz language]]. Of these 1,433 speakers lived in Guanajuato, and the other 115 in San Luis Potosí.

Their language belongs to the Pamean sub-branch of the [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pamean]] branch of the [[Oto-Manguean]] language family, the closest relative of the Chichimeca Jonaz language is the [[Pame language]].

==Spanish colonization of the Americas==
During the ensuing Spanish colonization of the Americas, the Chichimecas Jonaz descendants, whom are the Pame nation, joined the Chichimeca Confederation to fight against the Spanish Empire in the [[Chichimeca War]]. The Chichimeca Confederation defeated the Spanish Empire in this forty-year war. The Chichimeca War was the longest lasting and most expensive military conflict to Spain in the history of the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

A 2014 document on the worst forms of child labor released by the U.S. Department of Labor estimated that approximately 20.2% of children between the ages of 7 and 14, or 388,541 children make up the labor force in Bolivia.&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor"&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Findings on the worst forms of child labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/findings/2014TDA/bolivia.pdf|website=www.dol.gov|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous children are more likely to be engaged in labor than children who reside in urban areas.&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor" /&gt; The activities of child laborers are diverse, however the majority of child laborers are involved in agricultural labor, and this activity varies between urban and rural areas.&lt;ref name="Nam, Soo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nam|first1=Soo|title=Child labor in Latin America|journal=Law and Business Review of the Americas|date=Fall 2013|volume=19|issue=4|pages=523–549}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Bolivia has ratified the United Nations [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF-Bolivia Legislation|url=http://www.unicef.org/bolivia/legislation_1454.htm|website=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolivia has also ratified the International Labour Organization’s [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973]] (138) and the ILO’s worst forms of child labor convention (182).&lt;ref name="ILO ratifications"&gt;{{cite web|title=ratifications of Bolivia, Plurinational State of|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:11200:0::NO::P11200_COUNTRY_ID:102567|website=ilo.org|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, the Bolivian government passed the new child and adolescent code, which lowered the minimum working age to ten years old given certain working conditions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bolivia law allows 'self-employed children' aged 10 to work|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-28360838|accessdate=20 November 2015|agency=BBC News|date=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new code stipulates that children between the ages of ten and twelve can legally work given they are self-employed while children between 12 and 14 may work as contracted laborers as long as their work does not interfere with their education and they work under parental supervision.&lt;ref name="Codigo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Codigo del Niño, Niña, y Adolescente|url=http://www.unicef.org/bolivia/bo_legislation_codigotexto.pdf|website=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=Codigo del Niño, Niña, y Adolescente}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

The [[International Labour Organization]] defines child labor as work that “deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity and that is harmful to their mental and physical development.” &lt;ref name="IPEC child labour"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child labour (IPEC)|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm|website=ilo.org|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=IPEC child labour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNICEF]] defines children as engaging in child labor as those between the ages of 5 and 11 who participate in one hour of economic activity or 28 hours of domestic activity a week, and those between 12 and 14 who participate in at least 14 hours of economic activity or 28 hours of domestic work a week.&lt;ref name="Unicef definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicef-Definitions|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/stats_popup9.html|website=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=UNICEF definitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of work==
A large percentage of child laborers, about 70.9% are employed in the agricultural sector, working in activities such as planting and harvesting corn, working on cattle ranches, and planting and harvesting chestnuts and sugarcane.&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor" /&gt; In rural areas children begin working at a young age, and participate in activities on small-scale farms and on medium and large plantations doing activities such as sowing, harvesting, weeding and taking care of cattle.&lt;ref name=Hindman /&gt; Children who work in subsistence agriculture are exposed to harmful chemicals and are obligated to work for long hours, which reduces their ability to receive an education &lt;ref name="Nam, Soo" /&gt; Work on plantations is more difficult than work on small-scale farms, and children are exposed to more pesticides and hazardous working conditions which may result in infections and physical injuries from use of farm equipment.&lt;ref name=Hindman /&gt; [[Mining in Bolivia]] is a common activity carried out by child laborers in rural areas, and the ILO has estimated that around 13,500 children are involved in mining.&lt;ref name="Nam, Soo" /&gt; Work in mines is divided along age and gender lines, with girls and younger children involved in less dangerous work such as washing clothes and searching for minerals outside of mining sites while only boys work in actual mines in more dangerous work involving use of explosives and the grinding of minerals&lt;ref name=Hindman /&gt; In urban areas, children are involved in agriculture but are mainly involved in jobs in industry and service which include domestic labor, woodwork, vending and prostitution.&lt;ref name="Nam, Soo" /&gt; Work in urban areas is divided along gender lines with girls mostly carrying out jobs in markets or in domestic labor while boys do more physically strenuous labor in construction sites or working in garages, and children who work in domestic labor and on the streets are more susceptible to physical, verbal and sexual abuse as there is little protection for these children.&lt;ref name=Hindman /&gt; Children involved in the worst forms of child labor such as mining, child prostitution and strenuous plantation work live in deplorable living conditions and have limited access to sanitary water, and good healthcare .&lt;ref name=Lieten&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=G.K.

==Causes==

===Poverty===
Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in South America, with 45% of its population living below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="World Bank Development Indicators"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia Data|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/bolivia#cp_wdi|website=data.worldbank.org|publisher=The World bank|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=World Bank Development Indicators}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is a major cause of child labor in Bolivia, and children from poor families work in order to support the well-being of their families and to supply their basic needs of survival.&lt;ref name="Luis Calva"&gt;{{cite book|last1=(compilador)|first1=Luis Felipe López Calva|title=Trabajo infantil : teoría y lecciones de la América Latina|date=2006|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|location=México|isbn=9681681207|edition=1.|ref=Luis Calva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low living standards combined with low educational attainment increases poverty rates and the prevalence of child labor.&lt;ref name="Nam, Soo" /&gt; UNICEF reports that a family’s access to financial credit influences the likelihood of children working, as greater access to financial credit reduces the chances of children working, and of children working in more dangerous occupations.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Informe 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnitud y Características del trabajo Infantil en Bolivia- Informe Nacional 2008|url=http://www.unicef.org/bolivia/magnitud_y_caracteristicas_del_TI_en_Bolvis_INE_OIT_baja.pdf|website=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=UNICEF Informe 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Lack of access to an education is a major cause and consequence of child labor.&lt;ref name="ILO-child labor and education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labor and education in Bolivia|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_IPEC_PUB_25955/lang--en/index.htm|website=ilo.org|publisher=ILO|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=ILO-child labor and education}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study carried out by Jiménez and Vera concerning disparities in educational attainment in Bolivia found that a gap exists between urban and rural areas, with children in urban areas having a higher rate of primary education completion and access to an education.&lt;ref name=Jiminez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jiménez|first1=Wilson|last2=Vera|first2=Miguel|title=Indigenous Population and Differences in Access to Primary Education in Bolivia|url=http://www.focal.ca/pdf/education_Jimenez-Vera_indigenous%20population%20differences%20access%20primary%20education%20Bolivia_March%202010_e.pdf|website=www.focal.ca|publisher=FOCAL|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=FOCAL-Indigenous access to education Bolivia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILO reports that the percentage of children who are not enrolled in school is 2.5%, with a higher percentage of rural children being out of school.&lt;ref name="ILO education"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labour and Education in Bolivia|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_IPEC_PUB_25955/lang--en/index.htm|website=ilo.org|publisher=ILO|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=ILO education}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study carried out by Zapata, Contreras and Kruger (2011) found that gender and ethnicity plays a role in the relationship between child labor and educational attainment in Bolivia. They found that girls are 51% more likely to not be enrolled in school and to be working, mostly in domestic occupations, and indigenous children are 60% more likely to not be enrolled in school and to be working.&lt;ref name=Zapata&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zapata|first1=Daniela|last2=Contreras|first2=Dante|last3=Kruger|first3=Diana|title=Child Labor and Schooling in Bolivia: Who’s Falling Behind?

===Cultural===
The causes of child labor are not only to economic depravity but also to cultural reasons. In Andean culture, work is seen as an important agent of socialization for children as it is an integral part of their inclusion into the wider community, and it enables them to learn traditional societal values .&lt;ref name=Hindman /&gt; Work is important to the social organization of indigenous communities, where children work in order to contribute to the cohesiveness of family units and while the whole community works together to protect children &lt;ref name=Ruiz&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=Domic|title=Niños trabajadores : la emergencia de nuevos actores sociales|date=1999|publisher=Programa de Investigación Estratégica en Bolivia,|location=La Paz, Bolivia|ref=Ruiz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural cause of child labor is related to definitions of children and childhood. Western concepts of childhood define children as vulnerable and helpless and lead to attempts to abolish child labor in order to protect children.&lt;ref name=Burman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burman|first1=Erica|title=Deconstructing developmental psychology|date=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London ; New York|isbn=0415064384|edition=1st publ.|ref=Burman}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hanson and Vandaele (2003), child laborers disagree with the Western perspective of childhood and claim  their right to work in dignity as  social agents in society &lt;ref name=Vandaele&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanson|first1=Karl|last2=Vandaele|first2=Arne|title=Working children and international labour law: A critical analysis|journal=The International Journal of Children's Rights|date=1 March 2003|volume=11|issue=1|pages=73–146|doi=10.1163/092755603322384038|ref=Vandaele}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiatives against child labor==

In the UNICEF Bolivia country program (2013-2017), they have pledged to increase technical support to management and monitoring systems social services that protect children from abuse and sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Development programme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bolivia-country programme document 2013-2017|url=http://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/files/Bolivia-2013-2017-final_approved-English-14Sept2012.pdf|website=unicef.org|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=20 November 2015|ref=UNICEF Development programme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program seeks to improve overall children’s overall access to social services and to protest children’s rights.&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor" /&gt;

The ILO’s [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labor]] (IPEC) works in Bolivia to combat child labor through promotion of equitable access to education through research and statistics on the impact of child labor on educational attainment and monitoring of the worst forms of child labor.&lt;ref name="IPEC child labour" /&gt;

The Bolivian Ministry of Education has undertaken initiatives to improve the educational attainment of child laborers including an "accelerated leveling program" for child laborers who are behind in school.&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor" /&gt;

[[File:Clone war of sea anemones 2-17-08-2.jpg|thumb|[[Sea anemones]] compete for the [[Territory (animal)|territory]] in [[tide pools]]]]

'''Competition''' is an  [[Biological interaction|interaction]] between [[organism]]s or [[species]] in which both the organisms or species are harmed. [[Limiting factor|Limited]] supply of at least one [[Resource (biological)|resource]] (such as [[food]], [[water]], and [[Territory (animal)|territory]]) used by both can be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;Begon, M.; Harper, J. L.; Townsend, C. R. (1996) ''[[Ecology: Individuals, populations and communities]]'' Blackwell Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition both within and between [[species]] is an important topic in [[ecology]], especially [[community ecology]]. Competition is one of many interacting [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors that affect [[community (ecology)|community]] structure. Competition among members of the same species is known as [[intraspecific competition]], while competition between individuals of different species is known as [[interspecific competition]]. Competition is not always straightforward, and can occur in both a direct and indirect fashion.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html |author1 =Sahney, S. |author2=Benton, M.J. |author3 =Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume=6 | pages=544–547 | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[competitive exclusion principle]], species less suited to compete for resources should either [[Adaptation|adapt]] or [[Extinction|die out]], although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. According to [[evolutionary theory]], this competition within and between species for resources is important in [[natural selection]]. However, competition may play less of a role than expansion among larger [[clades]];&lt;ref name="Jardine2012"&gt;{{citation |author1 =Jardine, P.E. |author2 =Janis, C.M. |author3 =Sahney, S. |author4 =Benton, M.J. | title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates Glires | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | year=2012 | pages= 1–10 | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001 | volume=365-366}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

== By mechanism ==
Competition occurs by various [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanism]]s, which can generally be divided into direct and indirect. These  apply equally to intraspecific and interspecific competition. Biologists typically recognize two types of competition: interference and exploitative competition. During interference competition, organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources. For example, large [[aphid]]s defend feeding sites on [[Populus angustifolia|cottonwood]]&lt;!--which species?--&gt; leaves by ejecting smaller aphids from better sites. In contrast, during exploitative competition, organisms interact indirectly by consuming scarce resources. For example, [[plants]] consume [[nitrogen]] by [[Nitrogen assimilation|absorbing]] it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. Plants that produce many roots typically reduce [[Nitrogen fixation|soil nitrogen]] to very low levels, eventually killing neighboring plants.{{cn|date=January 2017}}
 
[[File:Hirschkampf.jpg|thumb|Male-male competition in [[red deer]] during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] is an example of interference competition within a species.]]

===Interference===

Interference competition occurs directly between individuals via [[aggression]] etc. when the individuals interfere with foraging, survival, reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in a portion of the habitat. An example of this can be seen between the ant ''[[Novomessor cockerelli]]'' and [[Pogonomyrmex barbatus|red harvester ants]], where the former interferes with the ability of the latter to forage by plugging the entrances to their [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] with small rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Barton, Kasey E. |author2=Sanders, Nathan J. |author3=Gordon, Deborah M. |year=2002 |title=The Effects of Proximity and Colony Age on Interspecific Interference Competition between the Desert Ants ''Pogonomyrmex barbatus'' and ''Aphaenogaster cockerelli'' |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=376–382 |doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2002)148[0376:TEOPAC]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitative===

Exploitation competition occurs indirectly through a common [[limiting resource]] which acts as an intermediate. For example, use of resources depletes the amount available to others, or they compete for space.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D. (1982) Resource competition and community structure. Princeton university press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apparent===

Apparent competition occurs indirectly between two species which are both preyed upon by the same predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Predation, apparent competition, and the structure of prey communities |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040580977900429 |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |date=1977 |pages=197–229 |volume=12 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/0040-5809(77)90042-9 |first=Robert D. |last=Holt |pmid=929457}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, species A and species B are both prey of predator C. The increase of species A may cause the decrease of species B, because the increase of As may aid in the survival of predator Cs, which will increase the number of predator Cs, which in turn will hunt more of species B.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Van Nouhuys | first1=S. | last2=Hanski | first2=I. | doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00123.x | title=Apparent competition between parasitoids mediated by a shared hyperparasitoid | journal=Ecology Letters | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=82–84 | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By size asymmetry ==
{{Main|size-asymmetric competition}}

Competition varies from [[size-asymmetric competition|complete symmetric]] (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to [[size-asymmetric competition|perfectly size symmetric]] (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely [[size-asymmetric competition|size-asymmetric]] (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g. in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==By taxonomic relationship==
{{See also|Female intrasexual competition}}

Competition can occur between individuals of the same species, called intraspecific competition, or between different species, called interspecific competition. Studies show that intraspecific competition can regulate population dynamics (changes in population size over time). This occurs because individuals become crowded as a population grows. Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited. Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce. This reduces population size and slows population growth.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Species also interact with other species that require the same resources. Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species' populations at the same time. Experiments demonstrate that when species compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct. These experiments suggest that competing species cannot coexist (they cannot live together in the same area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

===Intraspecific===

{{Main|Intraspecific competition}}
Intraspecific competition occurs when members of the same species compete for the same [[Natural resource|resource]]s in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Townsend2008"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Townsend, Colin R.; Begon, Michael | title=Essentials of Ecology | year=2008 | pages=103–105 | isbn=978-1-4051-5658-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interspecific===

{{Main|Interspecific competition}}
Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered [[fecundity]], growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter [[population]]s, communities and the evolution of interacting species. An example among animals could be the case of [[cheetah]]s and [[lion]]s; since both species feed on similar prey, they are negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food, however they still persist together, despite the prediction that under competition one will displace the other. In fact, lions sometimes steal prey items killed by cheetahs.  Potential competitors can also kill each other, in so-called '[[intraguild predation]]'.  For example, in southern California coyotes often kill and eat gray foxes and bobcats, all three carnivores sharing the same stable prey (small mammals).&lt;ref&gt;.Fedriani, J. M., T. K. Fuller, R. M. Sauvajot and E. C. York. 2000. Competition and intraguild predation among three sympatric carnivores. [[Oecologia]], 125:258-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example among protozoa involves ''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' and ''[[Paramecium caudatum]].'' Russian ecologist, [[Georgy Gause]], studied the competition between the two species of ''Paramecium'' that occurred as a result of their coexistence. Through his studies, Gause proposed the [[Competitive exclusion principle]], observing the competition that occurred when their different ecological niches overlapped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgy Gause|Gause, G.F.]] (1934). ''The struggle for existence''. Baltimore, MD: Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. For example, mammals lived beside reptiles for many millions of years of time but were unable to gain a competitive edge until dinosaurs were devastated by the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

== Evolutionary strategies ==
{{Main|r/K selection theory|Verhulst equation}}

In evolutionary contexts, competition is related to the concept of r/K selection theory, which relates to the [[Natural selection|selection]] of [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s which promote success in particular environments. The theory originates from work on [[island biogeography]] by the ecologists [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R.]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson, E. O.]] (1967). ''The Theory of Island Biogeography'', [[Princeton University Press]] (2001 reprint), {{ISBN|0-691-08836-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[r/K selection theory]], selective pressures are hypothesised to drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: ''r''- or ''K''-selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Pianka|Pianka, E. R.]] (1970). On r and K selection. ''[[American Naturalist]] '104' '', 592-597.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, r and K, are derived from standard ecological [[algebra]], as illustrated in the simple [[Verhulst equation#Verhulst equation|Verhulst equation]] of [[population dynamics]]:&lt;ref name=Verhulst&gt;[[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst, P. F.]] (1838). Notice sur la loi que la population pursuit dans son accroissement. ''Corresp. Math. Phys. '10' '', 113-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right) \qquad \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the [[Population growth rate|growth rate]] of the [[population]] (''N''), and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of its local environmental setting. Typically, r-selected species exploit empty [[Ecological niche|niches]], and produce many [[offspring]], each of whom has a relatively low [[probability]] of surviving to adulthood. In contrast, K-selected species are strong competitors in crowded niches, and [[Parental investment|invest]] more heavily in much fewer offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Verhulst/&gt;

== Competitive exclusion principle ==

{{main article|Competitive exclusion principle}}

To explain how species coexist, in 1934 [[Georgii Gause]] proposed the [[competitive exclusion principle]] which is also called the Gause principle: species cannot coexist if they have the same [[ecological niche]]. The word "niche" refers to a species' requirements for survival and reproduction. These requirements include both resources (like food) and proper [[habitat]] conditions (like temperature or pH). Gause reasoned that if two species had identical niches (required identical resources and habitats) they would attempt to live in exactly the same area and would compete for exactly the same resources. If this happened, the species that was the best competitor would always exclude its competitors from that area. Therefore, species must at least have slightly different niches in order to coexist.&lt;ref name=hardin60&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardin, Garrett |title=The competitive exclusion principle |journal=Science |volume=131 |pages=1292–1297 |issue=3409 |year=1960 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/seminars/hardin.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 |pmid=14399717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocheville2015&gt;{{cite book | last=Pocheville | first=Arnaud | year=2015 | chapter=The Ecological Niche: History and Recent Controversies | chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/6188833/The_Ecological_Niche_History_and_Recent_Controversies | editor1-last=Heams | editor1-first=Thomas | editor2-last=Huneman | editor2-first=Philippe | editor3-last=Lecointre | editor3-first=Guillaume |display-editors=3 | editor4-last=Silberstein | editor4-first=Marc | title=Handbook of Evolutionary Thinking in the Sciences | location=Dordrecht | publisher=Springer | publication-date=2015 | pages=547–586 | isbn=978-94-017-9014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character displacement ==
[[File:Geospiza fortis.jpg|thumbnail|left|Medium ground finch ([[Geospiza fortis]]) on Santa Cruz Island in the [[Galapagos Islands|Galapagos]]]]
{{main article|Character displacement}}

Competition can cause species to evolve differences in traits. This occurs because the individuals of a species with traits similar to competing species always experience strong interspecific competition. These individuals have less reproduction and survival than individuals with traits that differ from their competitors. Consequently, they will not contribute many offspring to future generations. For example, [[Darwin's finches]] can be found alone or together on the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Both species' populations actually have more individuals with intermediate-sized beaks when they live on islands without the other species present. However, when both species are present on the same island, competition is intense between individuals that have intermediate-sized beaks of both species because they all require intermediate sized seeds. Consequently, individuals with small and large beaks have greater survival and reproduction on these islands than individuals with intermediate-sized beaks. Different finch species can coexist if they have traits—for instance, beak size—that allow them to specialize on particular resources. When ''[[Geospiza fortis]]'' and ''[[Geospiza fuliginosa]]'' are present on the same island, ''G. fuliginosa'' tends to evolve a small beak and ''G. fortis'' a large beak. The observation that competing species' traits are more different when they live in the same area than when competing species live in different areas is called character displacement. For the two finch species, beak size was displaced: Beaks became smaller in one species and larger in the other species. Studies of character displacement are important because they provide evidence that competition is important in determining ecological and evolutionary patterns in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, W. L., and [[E. O. Wilson]]. 1956. "Character displacement". ''Systematic Zoology'' 5:49–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2016}}
{{Ranks of Nobility}}
'''Count''' (Male) or '''Countess''' (Female) is a title in [[Europe]]an countries for a [[nobility|noble]] of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility.&lt;ref name="pine"&gt;[[L. G. Pine|Pine, L. G.]] ''Titles: How the King Became His Majesty''. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1992. p. 73. &lt;!-- ISBN 1-56619-085-5  INVALID ISBN --&gt; {{OCLC|27827106}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''count'' came into English from the [[French language|French]] ''comte'', itself from [[Latin]] ''[[comes]]''—in its [[Accusative case|accusative]]  ''comitem''—meaning “companion”, and later “companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor”. The adjective form of the word is "[[Wikt:comital|comital]]". The [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] equivalent is an [[earl]] (whose wife is a "countess", for lack of an [[English language|English]] term). Equivalents of the rank of count exist or have existed in the nobility structures in various non-European countries, such as ''[[hakushaku]]'' during the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial era]].

==Definition==
{{Main|Comes}}
In the late [[Roman Empire]], the Latin title ''[[comes]]'', meaning (imperial) "companion", denoted the high rank of various courtiers and provincial officials, either military or administrative: before [[Anthemius]] became emperor in the West in 467, he was military ''comes'' charged with strengthening defenses on the [[Danube]] frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors |publisher=University of South Carolina |url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/anthemiu.htm |accessdate=2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western Roman Empire, Count came to indicate generically a military commander but was not a specific rank. In the Eastern Roman Empire, from about the seventh century, "count" was a specific rank indicating the commander of two [[Centuria|centuries]] (i.e., 200 men).

Military counts in the Late Empire and the Germanic successor kingdoms were often appointed by a ''[[Duke|dux]]'' and later by a king. From the start the count was not in charge of a roving warband, but settled in a locality, known as a county; his main rival for power was the [[bishop]], whose [[diocese]] was sometimes coterminous with the county.

In many [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdoms in the early [[Middle Ages]], a count might also be a [[count palatine]], whose authority derived directly from the royal household, the "[[palace]]" in its original sense of the seat of power and administration. This other kind of count had vague antecedents in [[Late antiquity|Late Antiquity]] too: the father of [[Cassiodorus]] held positions of trust with Theodoric, as ''comes rerum privatarum'', in charge of the imperial lands, then as ''comes sacrarum largitionum'' ("count of the sacred doles"), concerned with the finances of the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050510135935/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/jod/texts/cassbook/chap1.html |archivedate=2005-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of ''comes'' was originally not hereditary. By virtue of their large estates, many counts could pass the title to their heirs—but not always. For instance, in [[Piast Poland# the Early Kingdom of Poland, (1025–1146)|Piast Poland]], the position of ''komes'' was not hereditary, resembling the early [[Merovingian]] institution. The title had disappeared by the era of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the office had been replaced by others. Only after the [[Partitions of Poland]] did the title of "count" resurface in the title ''hrabia'', derived from the German ''Graf''.

The title of Count was also often conferred by the monarch as an honorific title for special services rendered, without a feudal estate (countship, county) being attached, so it was merely a title, with or without a domain name attached to it. In the [[United Kingdom]], the equivalent "Earl" can also be used as a [[courtesy title]] for the eldest son of a duke or marquess. In [[Italy]], by contrast, all the sons of certain counts were counts (''contini''). In [[Sweden]] there is a distinction between counts (Swedish: ''greve'') created before and after 1809. All children in comital families elevated before 1809 are called count/countess. In families elevated after 1809, only the head of the family is called count, the rest had a status similar to barons and were called by the equivalent of Mr/Ms/Mrs, before the recognition of titles of nobility was abolished.

===Compound and related titles===
Apart from all these, a few unusual titles have been of comital rank, not necessarily to remain there.
*[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (English: ''Dolphin''; Spanish: ''Delfín''; Italian: ''Delfino''; Portuguese: ''Delfim''; {{lang-la|Delphinus}}) was a multiple (though rare) comital title in southern France, used by the Dauphins of Vienne and Auvergne, before 1349 when it became the title of the heir to the French throne. The Dauphin was the lord of the province still known as the ''région [[Dauphiné]]''.
*'''Conde-Duque''' "Count-Duke" is a rare title used in [[Spain]], notably by [[Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares]] who had inherited the title of count of Olivares, but being created Duke of Sanlucar la Mayor by King Philip IV of Spain begged permission to preserve his inherited title in combination with the new honour—according to a practice almost unique in Spanish history; logically the incumbent ranks as Duke (higher than Count) just as he would when simply concatenating both titles.
*'''Conde-Barão''' 'Count-Baron' is a rare title used in [[Portugal]], notably by D. Luís Lobo da Silveira, 7th Baron of Alvito, who received the title of Count of Oriola in 1653 from King John IV of Portugal. His palace in Lisbon still exists, located in a square named after him (Largo do Conde-Barão).
*'''Archcount''' is a very rare title, etymologically analogous to [[archduke]], apparently never recognized officially, used by or for:
**the [[count of Flanders]] (an original ''[[pairie]]'' of the French realm in present Belgium, very rich, once expected to be raised to the rank of kingdom); the informal, rather descriptive use on account of the countship's de facto importance is rather analogous to the unofficial epithet ''Grand Duc de l'Occident'' (before [[Grand duke]] became a formal title) for the even wealthier [[Duke of Burgundy]]
**at least one [[Count of Burgundy]] (i.e. ''Freigraf'' of [[Franche-Comté]])
*In German kingdoms, the title ''[[Graf]]'' was combined with the word for the jurisdiction or domain the nobleman was holding as a fief or as a conferred or inherited jurisdiction, such as ''[[Margrave|Markgraf]]'' (see also [[Marquess]]), ''[[landgrave|Landgraf]]'', ''[[Freigraf]]'' ("free count"), ''[[Burgrave|Burggraf]]'', where ''burg'' signifies castle; see also [[Viscount]], ''[[count palatine|Pfalzgraf]]'' (translated both as "Count Palatine" and, historically, as "Palsgrave"), ''Raugraf'' ("Raugrave", see "[[Graf]]", and ''[[waldgrave|Waldgraf]]'' (''comes nemoris''), where ''wald'' signifies a large forest).
* The German ''Graf'' and Dutch ''graaf'' ({{lang-la|Grafio}}) stems from the Byzantine-Greek ''grapheus'' meaning "he who calls a meeting [i.e. the court] together").{{citation needed|date=May 2012|reason=what is the source for this translation?}}
* The Ottoman military title of Serdar was used in Montenegro and Serbia as a lesser noble title with the equivalent rank of a Count.
* These titles are not to be confused with various minor administrative titles containing the word -''graf'' in various offices which are not linked to nobility of feudality, such as the Dutch titles ''Pluimgraaf'' (a court sinecure, so usually held by noble courtiers, may even be rendered hereditary) and ''Dijkgraaf'' (to the present, in the Low Countries, a managing official in the local or regional administration of water household through dykes, ditches, controls etc; also in German ''Deichgraf'', synonymous with ''Deichhauptmann'', "dike captain"). this is count to wear.

===Territory of today's France===

====West-Francia proper====
Since [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] (1137–80), the highest precedence amongst the vassals ([[Prince-bishop]]s and secular nobility) of the French crown was enjoyed by those whose benefice or temporal fief was a ''pairie'', i.e. carried the exclusive rank of ''[[Pairie|pair]]''; within the first (i.e. clerical) and second (noble) estates, the first three of the original twelve ''anciennes pairies'' were ducal, the next three comital ''[[comté-pairie]]s'':
* [[Bishop of Beauvais|Bishop-counts of Beauvais]] (in Picardy)
* [[Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne|Bishop-counts of Châlons]] (in Champagne)
* Bishop-counts of [[Noyon]] (in Picardy)
* [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]], until united to the crown in 1271 by marriage
* [[Count of Flanders]] (Flandres in French), which is in the Low countries and was confiscated in 1299, though returned in 1303
* [[Count of Champagne]], until united to the crown (in 1316 by marriage, conclusively in 1361)
Later other countships (and duchies, even baronies) have been raised to this French peerage, but mostly as [[apanage]]s (for members of the royal house) or for foreigners; after the 16th century all new peerages were always duchies and the medieval countship-peerages had died out, or were held by royal princes

Other French countships of note included those of:
* [[Counts and dukes of Angouleme|Count of Angoulême, later Dukes]]
* [[List of Counts and Dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou, later Dukes]]
* [[Rulers of Auvergne|Count of Auvergne]]
* [[Counts and dukes of Bar|Count of Bar, later Dukes]]
* [[Count of Blois]]
* [[Count of Boulogne]]
* [[Countship of Foix|Count of Foix]]
* [[Count of Montpensier]]
* [[Count of Poitiers]]
* [[Count of Saint Germain]]

====In Germany====
{{main|Graf}}
A ''Graf'' ruled over a territory known as a Grafschaft ('county').  See also various comital and related titles; especially those actually reigning over a principality: [[Gefürsteter Graf]], [[Landgraf]], [[Reichsgraf]]; compare [[Markgraf]], [[Pfalzgraf]]

====In Italy====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Giulio Masetti]] --&gt;
The title of ''Conte'' is very prolific on the peninsula.  In the eleventh century, ''Conti'' like the Count of Savoy or the Norman Count of Apulia, were virtually sovereign lords of broad territories.  Even apparently "lower"-sounding titles, like [[Viscount]], could describe powerful dynasts, such as the [[House of Visconti]] which ruled a major city such as [[Milan]].  The essential title of a feudatory, introduced by the Normans, was ''signore'', modeled on the French ''seigneur'', used with the name of the [[fief]].  By the fourteenth century, ''conte'' and the Imperial title ''barone'' were virtually synonymous{{cn|date=August 2018}}.

Some titles of a count, according to the particulars of the patent, might be inherited by the eldest son of a Count. Younger brothers might be distinguished as "X dei conti di Y" ("X of the counts of Y"). However, if there is no male to inherit the title and the count has a daughter, in some regions she could inherit the title. The Papacy and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies might appoint counts palatine with no particular territorial fief. Until 1812 in some regions, the purchaser of land designated "feudal" was ennobled by the noble seat that he held and became a ''conte''. This practice ceased with the formal abolition of feudalism in the various principalities of early-19th century Italy, last of all in the [[Papal States]].

Many Italian counts left their mark on Italian history as individuals, yet only a few ''contadi'' (countships; the word ''contadini'' for inhabitants of a "county" remains the Italian word for "peasant") were politically significant principalities, notably:
* Norman Count of [[Apulia]]
* [[House of Savoy|Count of Savoy, later Duke]] (also partly in France and in Switzerland)
* [[Asti|Count of Asti]]
* [[Montferrat|Count of Montferrat (Monferrato)]]
* [[Montefeltro|Count of Montefeltro]]
* [[Tusculum|Count of Tusculum]]

=====Holy See=====
{{further|Papal count}}
Count/Countess is one of the noble titles granted by the Pope as a temporal sovereign, and the title's holder is sometimes informally known as a papal count/papal countess or less so as a Roman count/Roman countess, but mostly as count/countess. The comital title, which can be for life or hereditary, has been awarded in various forms by popes and Holy Roman Emperors since the Middle Ages, infrequently before the 14th century, and the pope continued to grant the comital and other noble titles even after 1870 and, although rarely, into the present day.

====In Austria====
The principalities tended to start out as margraviate or (promoted to) duchy, and became nominal archduchies within the Habsburg dynasty; noteworthy are:
* Count of Tyrol
* Count of [[Cilli]]
* Count of Schaumburg

==== In Poland ====
Numerous small ones, particularly:
* [[Counts of Galicia and Poland]]

==== In the Low Countries ====
Apart from various small ones, significant were :
* in present Belgium :
** [[Count of Flanders]] (Vlaanderen in Dutch), but only the small part east of the river Schelde remained within the empire; the far larger west, an original French [[comté-pairie]] became part of the French realm
** [[Count of Hainaut]]
** [[Count of Namur]], later a margraviate
** Count of Leuven (Louvain) soon became the Duke of Brabant
** Count of Mechelen, though the [[Heerlijkheid Mechelen]] was given the title of "Graafschap" in 1490, the city was rarely referred to as a county and the title of Count has not been in practical use by or for anyone of the series of persons that became rightfully entitled to it; the flag and weapon of the municipality still has the corresponding heraldic crowned single-headed eagle of sabre on gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppant.be/geschiedenis/geschiedenis.html |title=Geschiedenis |website=Ppant.be |date= |accessdate=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mechelen de oude hoofdstad van de Nederlanden'', F.O. Van Hammée (not verified, referenced on a blog)&lt;/ref&gt;
* in the present Netherlands:
** [[Count of Guelders]] later Dukes of Guelders
** [[Count of Holland]]
** [[Count of Zeeland]]
** [[Count of Zutphen]]

==== In Switzerland ====
[[File:DeSalisClothBellonna.jpg|thumb|100px|Comital ephemera: a Count's coronet and crest on a [[doily]].]]
* [[County of Geneva|Count of Geneva]]
* Count of [[Neuchâtel|Neuenburg]]
* [[Count of Toggenburg]]
* Count of [[Kyburg, Zurich|Kyburg]]
* [[Count de Salis-Soglio]] (also in the UK, Canada and Australia)
* [[Count de Salis-Seewis]]
* [[Count Panzutti|Count of Panzutti]]

===In other continental European countries===
====On the Iberian peninsula====

As opposed to the plethora of hollow "gentry" counts, only a few countships ever were important in medieval [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]; most territory was firmly within the [[Reconquista]] kingdoms before counts could become important. However, during the 19th century, the title, having lost its high rank (equivalent to that of [[Duke]]), proliferated.

=====Portugal=====
[[Portugal]] itself started as a countship in 868, but became a [[History of Portugal (1112-1279)|kingdom]] in 1139 (see:''[[County of Portugal]]''). Throughout the [[History of Portugal]], especially during the [[History of Portugal (1834-1910)|Constitutional Monarchy]] many other countships were created (see: ''[[List of Countships in Portugal]]'').

=====Spain=====
[[File:Heraldic Crown of Spanish Count.svg|right|thumb|[[Coronet]] of a count (Spanish heraldry)]]
In Spain, no countships of wider importance exist, except in the former Spanish march.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
*[[County of Barcelona]], the initial core of the [[Principality of Catalonia]], later one of the states of the [[Crown of Aragon]], which became one of the two main components of the Spanish crown.
*[[Count of Aragon]]
*[[Count of Castile]]
*[[Kingdom of Galicia|Count of Galicia]]
*[[Count of Lara]]
*[[Count Cassius]], progenitor of the [[Banu Qasi]]
*[[County of Urgell]], later integrated into the [[Principality of Catalonia]].
*The other [[Catalan counties]] were much smaller and were absorbed early into the [[County of Barcelona]] (between parentheses the annexation year): [[County of Girona]] (897), [[County of Besalú]], [[County of Osona]], which included the nominal [[County of Manresa]] (1111), [[County of Berga]] and [[County of Conflent]] (1117) and [[County of Cerdanya]] (1118). From 1162 these counties, together with that of Barcelona, were merged into the [[Principality of Catalonia]], a sovereign state that absorbed some other counties: [[County of Roussillon]] (1172), [[County of Pallars Jussà]] (1192), [[County of Empúries]] (1402), [[County of Urgell]] (1413) and [[County of Pallars Sobirà]] (1487), giving the Principality its definitive shape.

====Bulgaria====
In the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], a komit was a hereditary provincial ruler under the [[tsar]] documented since the reign of [[Presian I of Bulgaria|Presian]] (836-852)&lt;ref&gt;Лъв Граматик, [http://kroraina.com/NI/izvori/GIBI_V/156.gif Гръцки извори за българската история, т. V, стр. 156]; Жеков, Ж. България и Византия VII-IX в. - военна администрация, Университетско издателство "Св. Климент Охридски", София, 2007, {{ISBN|978-954-07-2465-2}}, стр. 254&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cometopuli dynasty|Cometopouli]] dynasty was named after its founder, the komit of [[Sofia|Sredets]].

====Montenegro and Serbia====
The title of Count ([[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]) was used in the [[Principality of Montenegro]] and the [[Principality of Serbia]] as a lesser noble title below that of [[Voivode|Vojvoda]] ([[Duke]]).

=== Crusader states ===
* [[Count of Edessa]]
* [[Count of Tripoli]] (1102–1288)

=== Scandinavia ===

In [[Denmark]] and historically in [[Denmark-Norway]] the title of count (''greve'') is the highest rank of nobility used in the modern period. Some Danish/Dano-Norwegian countships were associated with [[fief]]s, and these counts were known as "feudal counts" (''lensgreve''). They rank above ordinary (titular) counts, and their position in the Danish aristocracy as the highest-ranking noblemen is broadly comparable to that of Duke in other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Christian Herman von Krogh: ''Den høiere danske Adel. En genealogisk Haandbog'', C. Steen &amp; søn, 1866&lt;/ref&gt; The title of count is in modern times only granted to members of the [[Danish royal family]], sometimes in addition to a princely title and sometimes instead of it.

In the middle ages the title of [[earl|jarl]] (earl) was the highest title of nobility. The title was eventually replaced by the title of duke, but that title was abolished in Denmark and Norway already in the middle ages. Titles were only reintroduced with the introduction of absolute monarchy in 1660, with count as the highest title.

In Sweden the rank of count is the highest rank conferred upon nobles in the modern era. Unlike the rest of Scandinavia, the title of duke is still used in the country, but only by members of the royal family.

==Equivalents==
Like other major Western [[noble title]]s, Count is sometimes used to render certain titles in non-western languages with their own traditions, even though they are as a rule historically unrelated and thus hard to compare, but which are considered "equivalent" in rank.

This is the case with:

*the [[China|Chinese]] ''Bó'' (伯), hereditary title of nobility ranking below ''Hóu'' (侯) and above ''Zĭ'' (子)
*the [[Japan]]ese equivalent ''[[Hakushaku]]'' ({{lang|ja|伯爵}}), adapted during the [[Meiji restoration]]
*the [[Korea]]n equivalent ''Baekjak'' (백작) or ''Poguk''
* in [[Vietnam]], it is rendered ''Bá'', one of the lower titles reserved for male members of the Imperial clan, above ''Tử'' (Viscount), ''Nam'' (Baron) and ''Vinh phong'' (lowest noble title), but lower than—in ascending order—''Hầu'' (Marquis), ''Công'' (Prince), ''Quận-Công'' (Duke/Duke of a commandery) and ''Quốc-Công'' (Grand Duke/Duke of the Nation), all under ''Vương'' (King) and ''Hoàng Đế'' (Emperor).
*the [[India]]n ''[[Sardar]]'', adopted by the [[Maratha Empire]], additionally, [[Jagir]]dar and [[Deshmukh]] are close equivalents
*the [[Arabic]] equivalent ''[[Sheikh]]''
*In traditional [[Sulu]] equivalent to [[Datu Sadja]]

== In fiction ==
The title "Count" in fiction is commonly given to evil characters or vampires:

* [[Count Dracula]]
* [[The Count (Sesame Street)]]
* [[Count Olaf]]
* [[Count Chocula]]

'''Crime in Israel''' is low on a par with Norway and Germany,&lt;ref name="Crime Index for Country"&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime Index for County |url=https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp |website=Numbeo |publisher=Numbeo |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but includes [[drug trafficking]], [[arms trafficking]], [[burglary]], [[car theft]], [[human trafficking]], etc.

== Organized crime ==
[[Organized crime]] has increased in [[Israel]] since the 1990s and is described by the [[BBC]] and the Israeli Police as a "booming industry". The Israeli organised crime groups have extended their activities in foreign countries like the United States, South Africa, and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=BBCISKLC&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3723895.stm Israel struggles to keep lid on crime] ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the [[Israel Police]], drug trafficking, trafficking of women for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation, illicit [[gambling]], pirate [[filling station]]s and [[real estate]] are the major forms of [[crime]] in the country.&lt;ref name="GOC147"&gt;{{cite book

In 2002, the Israel Police documented 464,854 criminal files and non-prosecution cases while the number was 484,688 in 2003. This was an increase of 4.5% over 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.gov.il/english/Crime/Trend_Analysis/xx_trends.asp Crime in Israel – in 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031003024433/http://www.police.gov.il/english/Crime/Trend_Analysis/xx_trends.asp |date=3 October 2003 }} ''[[Israel Police]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crimes in Israel by Palestinians ==
Director of the Latin American Institute of the [[American Jewish Committee]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Dina Siegel, [[criminology]] professor H. G. van de Bunt, and lecturer in criminology Damián Zaitch showed in their book ''Global Organized Crime''  that a significant amount of crime in Israel, especially property crime, is committed by the residents of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA or PA).&lt;ref name="GOC145"&gt;{{cite book
|author= Dina Siegel, H. G. van de Bunt, Damián Zaitch

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Motor vehicle theft]] is a major crime committed by Palestinians. Since the early 1990s, there has been an increase in the rate of robberies in Israel. Between 1994 and 2001, the rate of robberies increased from 14.0 to 30.6 cases per 100,000 population. The reason behind this increase in robberies is analyzed as a result of the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] which according to the book ''Global Organized Crime'' "serves as a safe haven for Palestinian offenders". However, the organized crime industry associated with motor vehicle theft involves not only Palestinians, but also Israeli citizens, both Jewish and Arab. The parts of the stolen cars are removed in "chop shops" in the Palestinian territories and then these vehicles are sold in the black market in Israel. Media reports suggest some of these vehicles are even handed over to high-ranking Palestinian Authority officials.&lt;ref name="GOC146"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that since the beginning of 2010 through the end of February 2010, the Palestinian Authority police have destroyed 910 stolen cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher= Ma'am
|url=http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=262889
|date= 20 February 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Palestinian criminals are involved in organized crime in the country, Siegel et al. suggested one should not conclude that "organized crime in Israel is dominated by Palestinians. Organized crime committed by Jews or other non-Palestinians has been part of the Israeli crime scene for many years".&lt;ref name="GOC147"/&gt; 

Arms trafficking is another form of crime and it is directly associated with [[terrorism]]. There are many links between Israeli and Palestinian gangsters that facilitate these ventures.&lt;ref name="GOC146"/&gt;

==Prisons and prison population==
{{Main|List of prisons in Israel|Israeli Prison Service}}
According to official data Only about a quarter of the prisoners held in Israeli jails are Jews.(According to Israel Prison Service) 73 percent of overall prisoners are non-Jews Security prisoners and Criminal prisoners together.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton68/st11_05x.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/1.5216743&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Ethiopian-Israeli Jews minors imprisoned in Ofek Prison is approximately 20%, 27 out of 135 Minors prisoners and 27 out of 65 Jews prisoners in this prison (The only Criminal prison for minors in Israel). Substantially overrepresented, considering the Ethiopian Jews make up only 2% of the Israeli population.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4662919,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juvenile victims and perpetrators ==
Violence against minors is also a problem in Israel. In 1999, approximately 7,000 cases of crimes against minors were documented which included physical assault (54%), molestation (37%) and repeated physical victimization (9%).&lt;ref name="IPV139"&gt;{{cite book

|isbn= 0-275-97498-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Israeli minors are not solely the victims of crime, they are also sometimes the perpetrators. Teenage violence in schools is a problem in Israel; the first major study on teenage crime in the nation by T. Horowitz and M. Amir in 1981 indicated three major forms of violence in Israeli schools: [[theft]], [[burglary|breaking and entering]], and [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name="IPV141"&gt;{{cite book

== Murder ==
In Israel the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] produced by criminal activities is relatively low: 2.4 killed per 100,000 inhabitants in a year (in Switzerland the number is 0.71, in Russia is 14.9, in South Africa is 34, in Venezuela is 49).&lt;ref name="List of countries by intentional homicide rate"&gt;[[List of countries by intentional homicide rate]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 135 people were murdered in Israel. Two major motivations for homicide in Israel are violence against women (including [[honor killing]]s in [[Islam|Muslim]] families) and politically motivated violence, for example Arab [[terrorism]] against Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actnow.com.au/Issues/Honour_killings.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of women killed by their partners who were Arab decreased from 9 out of 11 in 2009 to 10 out of 15 in 2010 and 11 out of 24 on 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/report-every-third-israeli-woman-falls-victim-to-sexual-assault-1.476888&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hate-crimes ==
Racist incidents, including violence, continue taking place between the [[Jews|Jewish]] majority and [[Arab people|Arab]] minority. Arab-Jewish race riots have occurred on several occasions.

===Antisemitic===
In September 2007, eight white supremacists sporting tattoos including the number 88 (code for Heil Hitler because "H" is the eighth letter of the alphabet) from [[Petah Tikva]] were arrested after a year of being observed desecrating synagogues, giving Nazi salutes in the street, attacking religious Jews, collecting weapons explosives and spreading Nazi propaganda and making a video. They were [[Russians in Israel|immigrants from Russia]], and only one was fully Jewish. The rest had been allowed to immigrate due to some Jewish ancestry, but were not fully Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6985808.stm Israeli 'neo-Nazi gang' arrested] BBC 9 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Palestinian price tag attacks===
According to Palestinian officials, between 2005 and 2015, there were 11,000 attacks on Palestinians by Jews in the West Bank and in east Jerusalem. Between 2010 and 2015, three Palestinians were killed in arson attacks. Arson attacks on property were reported for 15 individual houses, 20 mosques and 4 churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS: JEWISH EXTREMISTS HAVE COMMITTED 375 'PRICE TAG' ATTACKS IN 2015|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Report-The-cost-of-price-tag-attacks-in-2015-412031|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=August 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Duna''' are an [[indigenous people]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] (also known as ''Yuna'') who live in the north-western area of the [[Southern Highlands Province]]. They number approximately 11,000 (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{e18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 25,000 (2002){{refn|group=note|Unless otherwise noted, all information refers to: [[#Roque|San Roque (2008)]]}}

==Society ==
[[File:Newguinea topo.png|thumb|TNG is strongly associated with the New Guinea Highlands (red)]][[Duna language|Duna]] is the native language of the [[Polysemy|polysemically]] named Duna people. Their environment lies in a mountainous terrain with altitudes ranging from 400 to 3000 meters. With an even distribution of rainfall (4500mm annually) and temperatures (18.5 to 28&amp;nbsp;°C), the environment allows farming and some tree cultivation. This is why most Duna are substance farmers with sweet potatoes being the staple food,&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite thesis

}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other gardened fruit and vegetables. Furthermore, they keep domesticated pigs and trap fish in [[Lake Kopiago]] while also hunting smaller game such as possums, bats and smaller birds. The diet also includes gathered mushrooms, ferns and cresses.

[[File:Papua New Guinea (5986599443).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Papua New Guinea Highlands]]The Duna are grouped in clans and parishes. Each member shares extensive responsibilities, requiring a substantial social effort for the group. Before the first direct contact with Europeans around the 1930s, their culture involved a strict separation of males and females. Early on, boys are separately raised and trained into manhood. Other significant themes of pre-contact life include ordered warfare, courting and the potency of ritual sacrifice. Since the establishment of a government station in the 1950s by Australia, the customs and traditions have undergone some significant changes, community schooling etc.

==Economy ==
There is only little paid work available in the area and electricity or telecommunication networks are not regularly accessible. The region does have a large health centre near Kopiago and a community school up to 8th grade. The Highland Highway is part of the overland transport network, but it is intermittent and in poor condition, so that most traveling is done on foot. Flights go fairly regular weekly or twice-weekly to Kopiago{{refn|group=note| The airport is operated by the [[Mission Aviation Fellowship]] out of [[Mount Hagen]] in [[Western Highlands Province]]}}.

'''Erich Hauert '''(born 1959) is a [[Swiss]] [[serial killer]] and [[sex offender]]. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for three murders, and his case had a significant impact on the treatment of dangerous sexual offenders and their legal provisions in Switzerland.

== Murder of Pasquale Brumann ==
On the afternoon of October 30, 1993, after a one-day operation on the Zollikerberg near [[Zurich|Zürich]], the body of the missing 20-year-old boy scout leader Pasquale Brumann was found. She had been stabbed in the neck and buried naked in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], November 1, 1993, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

== The perpetrator ==
As early as November 1, 1993, Hauert, who was convicted of evelen rapes and two sexually-charged murders, was arrested and later confessed to the crime. DNA analysis also provided further evidence to this. The detainee at the Regensdorf Detention Center had committed the crime while out on parole.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung, November 10, 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, Hauert had raped and murdered a 26-year-old jogger in [[Thalwil]] near [[Lake Zürich]] in 1982, and a 72-year-old woman in [[Kaiseraugst]] a year later. After he was arrested in June 1983 after an attempted robbery, he was proven guilty, classified as "extremely dangerous" and sentenced to life imprisonment.

In all the years he spent in prison Hauert's sentence had been loosened successively, as he behaved harmlessly and was given a few holiday leaves to no complains. On October 29, 1993, the Zürich Department of Justice approved another short leave for Hauert, and just a day later, he killed Brumann.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung, March 26, 1999, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Trial ===
In September 1996, Hauert was again sentenced to life imprisonment and reprimanded of parole.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung, September 20, 1996, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The mother of the murdered, Jeannette Brumann, filed a state lialibility suit against the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]], reaching up to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]]. The canton denied any responsibility, but recognized in April 1997 the family's claims for "moral reasons". In 1998, it finally came to a comprehensive comparison. The canton of Zürich paid against the renunciation of the family to further civil claims about one million francs.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung, March 20, 1998, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial against the four judicial staff involved in granting Hauert parole resulted in acquittals, and they received five digit process compensations.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung, March 3, 1999, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on the prison system ===
After the murder, the leave and discharge guidelines were tightened and the custody increased massively, reducing the number of relapses.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Zürcher Zeitung, February 22, 2001, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation ===
In response to the Brumann murder and another sex offence committed by another repeat offender, a [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)|popular initiative]] "Lifelong custody for unreachable, extremely dangerous sexual and violent offenders" was launched. This was submitted on May 3, 2000 with 194 390 valid signatures. On February 8, 2004, the initiative had the popular majority of 56.2 percent and the cantons of 21.5 accepted Act 123a in the Swiss Federal Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/101/a123a.html Wording of Article 123a]&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, sex offenders and violent offenders classified as extremely dangerous and untreatable in the [[Forensic psychiatry|forensic]] reports prepared for trials must be jailed until the end of their lives and are excluded from parole and early release. New reports may only be prepared when new scientific evidence has proven that the custodian can be cured. All reports must be prepared by at least two independent and experienced professionals. If, on the basis of these new opinions, an offender is released from custody, the competent authority must take responsibility if the person dismissed relapses.

=== Criticism of the Judiciary ===
The judiciary as the director of the [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]] [[Conseil d'État (Switzerland)|Conseil d'État]] at the time of cantonal [[corrections]] charge, later Swiss [[Federal Council (Switzerland)|Federal Councilor]], [[Moritz Leuenberger]], was made politically responsible for the death of Pasquale Brumann. He had been repeatedly informed by the competent state's attorney Pius Schmid on Hauert's dangerousness, but did not take the appropriate measures. In the report on the question of granting parole for Erich Hauert he had been warned that Hauert suffered from "psychopathic disturbances of the character structure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woz.ch/archiv/old/04/02/5535.html WOZ-Online], January 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bahrain]] is a nation in the [[Persian Gulf]], in a strategical position in relation to the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Iraq and Oman.

==Shias==
===Baharna===
{{main|Baharna}}
The Baharna are putatively regarded as of the [[Tylos|original pre-Islamic inhabitants of Bahrain]].

The Baharna are closely related to the Shia of Qatif, and even speak a similar dialect. Baharna live in [[Manama]], almost all the villages of the main island of Bahrain, several villages in the island of [[Muharraq]] in the north and in the island of [[Sitra]] to the east.  They speak similar dialects, with slight variations between villages, although the villages of Sitra have dialects which differ considerably from those of the main island.

Palm tree farming and fishing were the traditional economic activities of the Baharna.

There are also Shia Arabs concentrated in several neighborhoods in Muharraq city. They originally came from Al-Hasa, they are "Hasawis". They are distinct from the Baharna from villages outside the city proper. As a result of their proximity to surrounding [[Sunni]] Arabs and Africans, they speak the Sunni dialect.

=== Ajam ===
{{main|Ajam (Bahrain)}}
The Shia [[Persia]]ns of Bahrain are a significant and influential ethnic minority whose ancestors arrived in Bahrain in the early 20th century as laborers, artisans and merchants. There are large communities in Muharraq and Manama. Persians maintain a distinct culture and language, but have long since assimilated into Bahraini culture; they tend to identify themselves more as Persian Bahrainis or Bahrainis than Iranians. Almost all are bilingual in Arabic and Persian, with school, work and daily affairs conducted in Arabic and Persian usually relegated to the family domain. Almost all have possessed Bahraini citizenship since birth; in most cases their parents, and in some cases their grandparents, are also holders of Bahraini citizenship.

== Sunnis ==
The native Sunni population has been historically compartmentalized into the three groups listed below, with the Sunni Arabs forming the majority of the Bahraini population. Sunni Bahrainis are mostly concentrated in areas such as Busaiteen, [[Budaiya]], Jasra, Zallaq, Askar, Jaw, al-Dur, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saaid.net/book/open.php?cat=120&amp;book=9880 حركة التشيُّع في الخليج العربي ( دراسة تحليليّة نقديّة )] (in [[Arabic]]) By Abdulaziz al-Badah, p.253.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabs ===
Sunni Arabs are mostly descendants of tribes from central Arabia. Sunni Arabs are the most influential ethnic group in Bahrain, they hold most government positions and the [[Al Khalifa|Bahraini monarchy]] are Sunni Arabs. Sunni Arabs have traditionally lived in areas such as Zallaq, Muharraq, Riffa and Hawar islands.

=== [[Afro-Arabs]] ===
Most Bahrainis of African descent originate from East Africa and have traditionally lived in Muharraq Island and Riffa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hoteltravel.com/bahrain/manama/bahrains-rainbow-nation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huwala ===
{{main|Huwala}}
The Huwala are the descendants of [[Sunni]] Iranians who migrated to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] during the 19th century. Many of them originally lived in Awadhiya (a neighborhood in Godaibiya) and Hoora, both which are now nearly exclusively only populated by foreigners of Filipino, Indian and Bengali origins, however they later resettled in [[Muharraq Island]] and [[Riffa]].&lt;ref&gt;الهولة في البحرين ج ٧&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Asians==
For the vast majority of its history Bahrain has been economically and culturally dependant on two regions, Assyrian and Meluhas the latter being Indians comprising the current state of Gujarat. 

There is both literary and archaeological evidence of extensive trade between [[Ancient Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley civilization]]. Impressions of clay seals from the Indus Valley city of Lothal and [[Harappa]] were evidently used to seal bundles of merchandise, as clay seal impressions with cord or sack marks on the reverse side testify. Numerous Indus Valley seals have turned up at [[Ur]] and other Mesopotamian sites, far outnumbering even local seals which shows their preference for the Indian economic currencies and seals.
[[File:AncientTombsOfBahrain.svg|thumb|left|Location of the [[Dilmun burial mounds]] in Bahrain.]]

The "Persian Gulf" types of circular, stamped (rather than rolled) seals known from Dilmun, that appear at [[Lothal]] in [[Gujarat]], India, and [[Failaka]], as well as in Mesopotamia, are convincing corroboration of the long-distance sea trade. What the commerce consisted of is less known: timber and precious woods, [[ivory]], [[lapis lazuli]], [[gold]], and luxury goods such as [[carnelian]] and glazed stone beads, [[pearl]]s from the Persian Gulf, shell and bone inlays, were among the goods sent to Mesopotamia in exchange for [[silver]], [[tin]], woolen textiles, olive oil and grains. [[Copper]] ingots from Oman and [[bitumen]] which occurred naturally in Mesopotamia may have been exchanged for cotton textiles and domestic fowl, major products of the Indus region that are not native to Mesopotamia. Instances of all of these trade goods have been found. The importance of this trade is shown by the fact that the weights and measures used at Dilmun were in fact identical to those used by the Indus, and were not those used in Southern Mesopotamia.

:"''the ships of Dilmun, from the foreign land, brought him wood as a tribute''".&lt;ref name="Larsen p33"&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=Curtis E.|title=Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarchaeology of an Ancient Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q65mRSPPU6UC|year=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-46906-5|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesopotamian trade documents, lists of goods, and official inscriptions mentioning Meluhha supplement Harappan seals and archaeological finds. Literary references to Meluhhan trade date from the [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian, the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], and [[Isin]]-[[Larsa]] Periods (c. 2350–1800 BC), but the trade probably started in the Early Dynastic Period (c. 2600 BC). Some Meluhhan vessels may have sailed directly to Mesopotamian ports, but by the Isin-Larsa Period, Dilmun monopolized the trade. The [[Bahrain National Museum]] assesses that its "Golden Age" lasted ca. 2200-1600 BC. Discoveries of ruins under the Persian Gulf maybe of Dilmun.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/12/09/ancient_dilmun_garden_eden_gulf_lost_civilisation/  The UK Register, Science, Lost ancient civilisation's ruins lie beneath Gulf, By Lewis Page Science, December 9, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BE XVII 88.jpg|thumb|250px|Correspondence between [[Ilī-ippašra]], the governor of Dilmun, and Enlil-kidinni, the governor of Nippur, ca. 1350 BC.]]

In the Mesopotamian [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', [[Gilgamesh]] had to pass through Mount [[Mashu]] to reach Dilmun, Mount Mashu is usually identified with the whole of the parallel [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanon]] and [[Anti-Lebanon mountains|Anti-Lebanon]] ranges, with the narrow gap between these mountains constituting the tunnel.&lt;ref name="UnwinUnwin1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=P. T. H. Unwin|author2=Tim Unwin|title=Wine and the Vine: An Historical Geography of Viticulture and the Wine Trade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U6XRp6gY8ucC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=31 May 2011|date=18 June 1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-14416-2|pages=80–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilmun, sometimes described as "the place where the sun rises" and "the Land of the Living", is the scene of some versions of the [[Sumerian creation myth]], and the place where the deified Sumerian hero of the flood, [[Utnapishtim]] ([[Ziusudra]]), was taken by the gods to live forever. [[Thorkild Jacobsen]]'s translation of the Eridu Genesis calls it ''"Mount Dilmun"'' which he locates as a ''"faraway, half-mythical place"''.&lt;ref name="Jacobsen1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thorkild Jacobsen|title=The Harps that once--: Sumerian poetry in translation, p. 150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-BI0h41yCEC|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=23 September 1997|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-07278-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dilmun is also described in the [[Epic poetry|epic]] story of [[Enki]] and [[Ninhursag]] as the site at which the [[Creation myth|Creation]] occurred. The promise of Enki to Ninhursag, the Earth Mother: &lt;poem&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;For Dilmun, the land of my lady's heart, I will create long waterways, rivers and canals,
whereby water will flow to quench the thirst of all beings and bring abundance to all that lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;
[[Ninlil]], the Sumerian goddess of air and south wind had her home in Dilmun. It is also featured in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh''.

However, in the early epic ''"[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]"'', the main events, which center on [[Enmerkar]]'s construction of the [[ziggurat]]s in [[Uruk]] and [[Eridu]], are described as taking place in a world "before Dilmun had yet been settled".

The immigration of South Asians to Bahrain started in the late quarter of the 19th century and today Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and Indians combined form the largest expatriate groups in Bahrain.

===Indians===
There were 197,273 Indian workers and 56,666 dependents as of 2014 and the majority of the public sector. Most of them are either Hindus or Christians, with a sizable [[Sikh]] and Muslim minority. There are multiple schools that were established in the country in the 20th century that offer the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] curriculum, the oldest of which is [[Indian School, Bahrain|The Indian School]] which was first established in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfmigration.eu/bahrain-foreign-population-by-country-of-citizenship-sex-and-migration-status-worker-family-dependent-selected-countries-january-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistanis===
In 2014 there were 39,765 Pakistani workers in Bahrain and 8,647 dependents, a further 30,000 have been given citizenship. A 2011 estimate states that 10,000 of them serve in security forces.&lt;ref name="stat"&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2011/03/30/bahrain-agrees-to-augment-defence-ties-with-pakistan.html Bahrain agrees to augment defence ties with Pakistan, By Baqir Sajjad Syed, 30 Mar 2011, Dawn]&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Pakistanis in Bahrain are Muslim.

===Bangladeshis===
Bangladesh recognized and established diplomatic ties with Bahrain in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdembassy.org.bh/relation/relation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; although Bangladeshi expatriates started arriving decades before that. In 2014 there were 92,193 working in Bahrain and 3,116 dependents.&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfmigration.eu/bahrain-foreign-population-by-country-of-citizenship-sex-and-migration-status-worker-family-dependent-selected-countries-january-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
===Filipinos===
In 2014 there were 25,568 Filipino workers in Bahrain and a further 3,189 dependents living there.

===Egyptians===
In 2014 there were 8,083 workers and 10,176 dependents living in Bahrain&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfmigration.eu/bahrain-foreign-population-by-country-of-citizenship-sex-and-migration-status-worker-family-dependent-selected-countries-january-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lankans===
In 2014 there were 5,790 Sri Lankan workers in Bahrain and a further 1,632 dependents living there.

===British===
In 2014 there were 2,367 British workers in Bahrain and 1,710 dependents &lt;ref&gt;http://gulfmigration.eu/bahrain-foreign-population-by-country-of-citizenship-sex-and-migration-status-worker-family-dependent-selected-countries-january-2014/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Gulf News states there were 9,000 permanent British residents in 2013 and that 240 were given citizenship&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/bahrain/bahrain-grants-citizenship-to-240-uk-citizens-1.1182895&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jews===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34077">'''Externalizing disorders''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C -ize .28-isation.2C -ization.29|or]] '''externalising disorders''') are mental disorders characterized by externalizing behaviors, maladaptive behaviors directed toward an individual's environment, which cause impairment or interference in life functioning. In contrast to individuals with [[internalizing disorder]]s who [[internalize]] (keep inside) their maladaptive [[emotion|emotions]] and [[cognition|cognitions]], such feelings and thoughts are externalized (manifested outside) in behavior in individuals with externalizing disorders. Externalizing disorders are often specifically referred to as [[disruptive behavior disorders]] ([[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]], [[oppositional defiant disorder]], and [[conduct disorder]]) or conduct problems which occur in childhood. Externalizing disorders, however, are also manifested in adulthood. For example, alcohol- and substance-related disorders and [[antisocial personality disorder]] are adult externalizing disorders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Externalizing Psychopathology in Adulthood: A Dimensional-Spectrum Conceptualization and Its Implications for DSM–V|journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date = 2005-11-01|issn = 0021-843X|pmc = 2242352|pmid = 16351376|pages = 537–550|volume = 114|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.114.4.537|first = Robert F.|last = Krueger|first2 = Kristian E.|last2 = Markon|first3 = Christopher J.|last3 = Patrick|first4 = William G.|last4 = Iacono}}&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing [[psychopathology]] is associated with [[Anti-social behaviour|antisocial behavior]], which is different from and often confused for [[asociality]].

==Signs and symptoms==

Externalizing disorders often involve emotion dysregulation problems and [[impulsivity]] that are manifested as antisocial behavior and aggression in opposition to authority, societal norms, and often violate the rights of others.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and                                         Conduct Disorders|url = http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm15|publisher = American Psychiatric Association|date = 2013-05-22|isbn = 0-89042-555-8|series = DSM Library|doi = 10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Diagnosis, assessment, and treatment of externalizing problems in children: the role of longitudinal data|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date = 1994-10-01|issn = 0022-006X|pmid = 7806720|pages = 901–917|volume = 62|issue = 5|first = R.

[[DSM-5]] classifications of externalizing disorders are listed herein, however, [[ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders|ICD-10]] can also be used to classify externalizing disorders. More specific criteria and examples of symptoms for various externalizing disorders can be found in the [[DSM-5]].

===DSM-5 classification===
There are no specific criteria for "externalizing behavior" or "externalizing disorders". Thus, there is no clear classification of what constitutes an externalizing disorder in the [[DSM-5]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turygin|first1=Nicole C.|last2=Matson|first2=Johnny L.|last3=Adams|first3=Hilary|last4=Belva|first4=Brian|title=The effect of DSM-5 criteria on externalizing, internalizing, behavioral and adaptive symptoms in children diagnosed with autism|journal=Developmental Neurorehabilitation|date=August 2013|volume=16|issue=4|pages=277–282|doi=10.3109/17518423.2013.769281|pmid=23617257}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder|conduct disorder (CD)]], [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD), [[pyromania]], [[kleptomania]], [[intermittent explosive disorder]] (IED), and [[substance-related disorder]]s are frequently referred to as externalizing disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] has also been posited as an externalizing disorder, but little research has examined and validated it to date given its recent addition to the DSM-5, and thus, it is not included further herein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of Externalizing Spectrum Disorders|last = Drabick|first = Deborah, A.G.|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-19-932467-5|location = New York, New York|pages = 9|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=f5yOCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=EXTERNALIZING+ACROSS+DEVELOPMENT&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|editor-last = Beauchaine|editor-first = Theodore P.|editor-last2 = Hinshaw|editor-first2 = Stephen P.|chapter = Overview of DSM Disruptive Behavior Disorders|last2 = Steinberg|first2 = Elizabeth|last3 = Hampton Shields|first3 = Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Regier|first1=Darrel A.|last2=Kuhl|first2=Emily A.|last3=Kupfer|first3=David J.|title=The DSM-5: Classification and criteria changes|journal=World Psychiatry|date=June 2013|volume=12|issue=2|pages=92–98|doi=10.1002/wps.20050|pmc=3683251|pmid=23737408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical aggression does not result in damage or destruction of property and does not result in physical injury to animals or other individuals. 2) Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against animals or other individuals occurring within a 12-month period."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to receive an IED diagnosis, "the magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors," "the recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated" and "are not committed to achieve some tangible objective."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, to receive an IED diagnosis, an individual must be 6 years or older (chronologically or developmentally), have functional impairment, and not have symptoms better explained by another mental disorder, medical condition, or substance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Substance use disorders====
According to the DSM-5, "the essential feature of a [[Substance-related disorder|substance use disorder]] is a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating that the individual continues using the substance despite significant substance-related problems."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Substance-Related and Addictive                                         Disorders|url = http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm16|publisher = American Psychiatric Association|date = 2013-05-22|isbn = 0-89042-555-8|series = DSM Library|doi = 10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596.dsm16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that at least 10 separate classes of drugs are covered in the DSM-5 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders section,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; it is outside the scope of this article.

==Psychopathic traits==
Individuals with [[Psychopathy|psychopathic traits,]] including [[Callous and unemotional traits|callous-unemotional (CU) traits]], represent a phenomenologically and etiologically distinct group with severe externalizing problems.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Annual Research Review: A developmental psychopathology approach to understanding callous-unemotional traits in children and adolescents with serious conduct problems|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.12152/abstract|journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date = 2014-06-01|issn = 1469-7610|pages = 532–548|volume = 55|issue = 6|doi = 10.1111/jcpp.12152|first = Paul J.|last = Frick|first2 = James V.|last2 = Ray|first3 = Laura C.|last3 = Thornton|first4 = Rachel E.|last4 = Kahn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychopathic traits have been measured in children as young as 2 years-old,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; are moderately stable,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = What are the associations between parenting, callous–unemotional traits, and antisocial behavior in youth?

==Developmental course==
ADHD often precedes the onset of ODD, and approximately half of children with ADHD, Combined Type also have ODD.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ODD is a risk factor for CD and frequently precedes the onset of CD symptoms.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Current Issues in the Diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, and Conduct Disorder|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032511-143150|journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|date = 2012-01-01|pmc = 4318653|pmid = 22035245|pages = 77–107|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032511-143150|first = Paul J.|last = Frick|first2 = Joel T.|last2 = Nigg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with an early onset of CD symptoms, with at least one symptom before age 10 years,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are at risk for more severe and persistent antisocial behavior continuing into adulthood.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Building an evidence base for DSM–5 conceptualizations of oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder: Introduction to the special section.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0021441|journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology|pmc = 3826598|pmid = 21090874|pages = 683–688|volume = 119|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/a0021441|first = Dustin A.|last = Pardini|first2 = Paul J.|last2 = Frick|first3 = Terrie E.|last3 = Moffitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth with early-onset conduct problems are particularly at risk for ASPD (note that an onset of CD prior to age 15 is part of the diagnostic criteria for ASPD),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; whereas CD is typically limited to adolescence when youth's CD symptoms begin during adolescence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Despite recent initiatives to study psychopathology along dimensions of behavior and neurobiological indices, which would help refine a clearer picture of the development and treatment of externalizing disorders, the majority of research has examined specific mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The R-Doc Initiative: Science and Practice|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/da.21930/abstract|journal = Depression and Anxiety|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 1520-6394|pages = 253–256|volume = 29|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/da.21930|first = Michelle G.|last = Craske}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, best practices for many externalizing disorders are disorder-specific.

In [[ancient Rome]], a '''gens''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ɛ|n|s}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|z}}), plural '''gentes''', was a family consisting of all those individuals who shared the same [[Roman naming conventions#Nomen|nomen]] and claimed descent from a common ancestor.  A branch of a gens was called a ''stirps'' (plural ''stirpes'').  The ''gens'' was an important social structure at Rome and throughout Italy during the period of the [[Roman Republic]].  Much of an individual's social standing depended on the gens to which he belonged.  Certain gentes were considered [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], others [[plebs|plebeian]], while some had both patrician and plebeian branches.  The importance of membership in a gens declined considerably in [[Roman Empire|imperial times]].&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;''[[Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities|Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiquities]]'', Second Edition, [[Harry Thurston Peck]], Editor (1897)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 2nd Ed. (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the ''gens''==
The word ''gens'' is sometimes translated as "race" or "nation", meaning a people descended from a common ancestor (rather than sharing a common physical trait).  It can also be translated as "clan" or "tribe", although the word [[Tribal Assembly|''tribus'']] has a separate and distinct meaning in Roman culture.  A gens could be as small as a single family, or could include hundreds of individuals.  According to tradition, in 479 BC the [[Fabia (gens)|gens Fabia]] alone were able to field a militia consisting of three hundred and six men of fighting age.  The concept of the gens was not uniquely Roman, but was shared with communities throughout Italy, including those who spoke [[Italic languages]] such as [[Latin]], [[Oscan language|Oscan]], and [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] as well as the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. All of these peoples were eventually absorbed into the sphere of Roman culture.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="livy2"&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', Book II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], Editor&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest gentes were said to have originated before the [[Founding of Rome|foundation of Rome]] (traditionally 753 BC), and claimed descent from mythological personages as far back as the time of the [[Trojan War]] (traditionally ended 1184 BC&lt;ref name="Chronographia" /&gt;). However, the establishment of the gens cannot long predate the adoption of hereditary surnames.  The ''[[Roman naming conventions|nomen gentilicium]]'', or "gentile name", was its distinguishing feature, for a Roman citizen's nomen indicated his membership in a gens.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronographia"&gt;[[Eratosthenes]], ''Chronographia'', cited in [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]], ''In Search of the Trojan War'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="livy1"&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', Book I&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomen could be derived from any number of things, such as the name of an ancestor, a person's occupation, physical appearance, behavior, or characteristics, or town of origin.  Because some of these things were fairly common, it was possible for unrelated families to bear the same nomen, and over time to become confused.

Persons could be [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] into a gens and acquire its nomen. A ''libertus'', or "[[freedman]]", usually assumed the nomen (and sometimes also the praenomen) of the person who had [[Manumission|manumitted]] him, and a naturalized citizen usually took the name of the [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]] who granted his [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]]. Freedmen and newly enfranchised citizens were not technically part of the gentes whose names they shared, but within a few generations it often became impossible to distinguish their descendants from the original members.  In practice this meant that a gens could acquire new members and even new branches, either by design or by accident.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pauly"&gt;''[[Realencyclopädie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]'', [[August Pauly]] and [[Georg Wissowa]], Editors&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stirpes===
Different branches or ''stirpes'' of a gens were usually distinguished by their [[cognomen|cognomina]], additional surnames following the nomen, which could be either personal or hereditary.  Some particularly large stirpes themselves became divided into multiple branches, distinguished by additional cognomina.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;

===Praenomina===
Most gentes regularly employed a limited number of [[given name|personal names]], or ''[[praenomen|praenomina]]'', the selection of which helped to distinguish members of one gens from another.  Sometimes different branches of a gens would vary in their names of choice.  The most conservative gentes would sometimes limit themselves to three or four praenomina, while others made regular use of six or seven.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;

There were two main reasons for this limited selection: first, it was traditional to pass down family names from one generation to the next; such names were always preferred.  Second, most patrician families limited themselves to a small number of names as a way of distinguishing themselves from the plebeians, who often employed a wider variety of names, including some that were seldom used by the patricians.  However, several of the oldest and most noble patrician houses frequently used rare and unusual praenomina.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pauly"/&gt;

Certain families also deliberately avoided particular praenomina.  In at least some cases, this was because of traditions concerning disgraced or dishonored members of the gens bearing a particular name.  For example, the [[Junia (gens)|gens Junia]] carefully avoided the praenomina ''[[Titus (praenomen)|Titus]]'' and ''[[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]'' after two members with these names were executed for treason.  A similar instance supposedly led the assembly of the [[Manlia (gens)|gens Manlia]] to forbid its members from bearing the praenomen ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]'', although this prohibition does not seem to have been strictly observed.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="livy2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', Book VI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social function of the gens==
In theory, each gens functioned as a state within a state, governed by its own elders and assemblies, following its own customs, and carrying out its own religious rites. Certain cults were traditionally associated with specific gentes.  The gentile assemblies had the responsibility of adoption and guardianship for their members.  If a member of a gens died [[wikt:intestate|intestate]] and without immediate family, his property was distributed to the rest of the gens.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;

The decisions of a gens were theoretically binding on all of its members.  However, no public enactment is recorded as having been passed by the assembly of a gens.  As a group, the gentes had considerable influence on the development of [[Roman law]] and religious practices, but comparatively little influence on the political and constitutional history of Rome.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;

==Patrician and plebeian gentes==
Certain gentes were considered patrician, and others plebeian.  According to tradition, the patricians were descended from the "city fathers", or ''patres''; that is, the heads of family at the time of its foundation by [[Romulus]], the first [[King of Rome]].  Other noble families which came to Rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate, including several who emigrated from [[Alba Longa]] after that city was destroyed by [[Tullus Hostilius]].  The last known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the 1st century BC was when the Claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to Rome in 504 BC, five years after the establishment of the Republic.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="livy2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="livy1"/&gt;

Numerous sources describe two classes amongst the patrician gentes, known as the ''gentes maiores'', or major gentes, and the ''gentes minores'', or minor gentes.  No definite information has survived concerning which families were numbered amongst the gentes maiores, or even how many there were.  However, they almost certainly included the [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilii]], [[Claudia (gens)|Claudii]], [[Cornelia (gens)|Cornelii]], [[Fabia (gens)|Fabii]], [[Manlia (gens)|Manlii]], and [[Valeria (gens)|Valerii]].  Nor is it certain whether this distinction was of any practical importance, although it has been suggested that the ''[[princeps senatus]]'', or speaker of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], was usually chosen from their number.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;

For the first several decades of the Republic, it is not entirely certain which gentes were considered patrician and which plebeian.  However, a series of laws promulgated in 451 and 450 BC as the [[Twelve Tables]] attempted to codify a rigid distinction between the classes, formally excluding the plebeians from holding any of the major magistracies from that time until the passage of the ''[[Lex Licinia Sextia]]'' in 367 BC.  The law forbidding the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians was repealed after only a few years, by the ''[[Lex Canuleia]]'' in 445 BC.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;

Despite the formal [[Conflict of the Orders|reconciliation of the orders]] in 367, the patrician houses, which as time passed represented a smaller and smaller percentage of the Roman populace, continued to hold on to as much power as possible, resulting in frequent conflict between the orders over the next two centuries.  Certain patrician families regularly opposed the sharing of power with the plebeians, while others favored it, and some were divided.&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Grant (author)|Michael Grant]], ''History of Rome'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many gentes included both patrician and plebeian branches.  These may have arisen through adoption or manumission, or when two unrelated families bearing the same nomen became confused.  It may also be that individual members of a gens voluntarily left or were expelled from the patriciate, along with their descendants.  In some cases, gentes that must originally have been patrician, or which were so regarded during the early Republic, were later known only by their plebeian descendants.&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;

By the first century BC, the practical distinction between the patricians and the plebeians was minimal.  Nonetheless, with the rise of imperial authority, several plebeian gentes were raised to the patriciate, replacing older patrician families that had faded into obscurity, and were no longer represented in the [[Roman senate]].  Although both the concept of the gens and of the patriciate survived well into imperial times, both gradually lost most of their significance.  In the final centuries of the [[Roman Empire|Western Empire]], ''[[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricius]]'' was used primarily as an individual title, rather than a class to which an entire family belonged.&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD" /&gt;

'''Glenn Lee Benner II''' (September 24, 1962 &amp;ndash; February 7, 2006) was a convicted [[murder]]er, executed by the State of [[Ohio]].

==Murders==
On August 6, 1985, Benner abducted 26-year-old Cynthia Sedgwick in the woods surrounding the [[Blossom Music Center]] in [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]], where they both attended a concert. Benner raped Sedgwick and choked her to death.

On January 2, 1986, Benner [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] an acquaintance, 21-year-old Trina Bowser, in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and raped and killed her. [[DNA testing]], conducted during federal [[appeal]]s in 2003, identified Benner as the source of [[semen]] in Bowser's [[vagina]] and [[anus]].

==Trial and execution==
On May 14, 1986, Benner was convicted for kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder.  He was also convicted for the [[attempted murder]]s and rapes of two other women on two separate occasions. 

He spent 19 years, eight months, and 25 days on [[death row]] before being [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[lethal injection]] on February 7, 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5388">Historically, '''Greeks in Azerbaijan''' have not formed a large community in comparison to those in neighbouring [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]]. It was composed mainly of [[Pontic Greek]] immigrants from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

== History ==
=== Under the Russian Empire ===
Initially, these immigrants arrived in the 1830s and settled in the village of [[Mehmana]] on the banks of the [[Tartar river]]. On 23 May 1830, the Georgian [[exarch]] appointed archpriest Vasily Andrianov to lead the religious community of Mehmana.&lt;ref name="pilijov"&gt;Ivan Pilijov. [http://www.greeks-su.com/ru/press/news/1889.html Greeks in Azerbaijan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127081311/http://www.greeks-su.com/ru/press/news/1889.html |date=2015-01-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, [[Trabzon|Trebizond]]-born Charalambos Koundourov (locally known as Usta Allahverdi) built two copper smelteries near [[Ordubad]] where the core staff consisted of Greek labourers. Ten years later, a school and a church for the Greek community were built there as well. The church was headed by Nikolaos Lavos. Koundourov's sons owned the smelteries after his death until the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref name="pilijov"/&gt;

Local Greeks were also prominent in architecture and construction. The Saint Nicholas Church in [[Baku]] and an Orthodox church in [[Altiagac, Azerbaijan|Altiaghaj]] were designed and built in the 1850s by Greek architects and contractors.&lt;ref name="pilijov"/&gt;

Greeks had not started immigrating to Baku, the present-day capital of Azerbaijan, until the oil boom of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Statistical records from 1886 revealed no Greek population in the [[Baku Governorate]], but the picture changed in 1897 when the census indicated 278 Greeks in the Baku Governorate and 658 in the [[Elisabethpol Governorate]] (compared to 102 in 1886). The immigrants consisted mainly of general labourers and retailers and included both Turkish citizens and natives of the Greek settlements elsewhere in the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="pilijov"/&gt;

In 1907, the city of Baku alone had an estimated Greek population of 800, most of whom had immigrated from [[Asia Minor]] and therefore could not execute religious services in Russian Orthodox churches where the working languages were [[Old Church Slavonic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Thus the Greek Benevolent Society of Baku received a permission to construct a Greek Orthodox church in Baku.&lt;ref name="pilijov"/&gt; The number of Greeks in Baku did not change much according to the 1917 official statistical data.&lt;ref&gt;Sudaba Zeynalova. [http://www.ca-c.org/c-g/2009/journal_rus/c-g-4/09.shtml Ethnodemographic Changes in the Caucasus: Development of Ethnic European Communities in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century]. Central Asia &amp; Central Caucasus Press AB, 2009, #4.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russian ethnographist Andrei Popov, there were 2,161 Greeks living in eight cities and villages across the Governorates of Baku and Elisabethpol as of 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Andrei Popov. [http://papounidis.com/pontian-greeks/47-pontijskie-greki Pontic Greeks].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet period ===

Another wave of Greek immigration took place in the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the establishment of Soviet rule in Baku in 1920. By 1923, Azerbaijan's Greek population rose to over 1,000, of which 58 people lived in the pioneer settlement of Mehmana. The building of the Greek philanthropic association located on Millionnaya Street (presently Amirov Street) in Baku housed an amateur Greek theatre, a church, a library and a primary school which had 89 students in 1921. There was a community football club named ''Embros''.&lt;ref name="pilijov"/&gt;

Curiously nearly a third of Azerbaijan's Greek population chose to retain foreign citizenship. By 1937, 95% of foreign citizens residing in Azerbaijan were Greeks. This factor, as well as the Soviet Union's changing attitude toward its Greek population led to Greeks of Baku being a target of repression and forced relocation. In 1937–1938, many members of the community were arrested and some later executed. Among the victims was actress [[Pamphylia Tanailidi]]. By 1939, with the help of the Greek embassy in the USSR, most foreign citizens of Greek origin left Baku for Greece. Two more waves of repression resulting in relocation to Central Asia and Siberia targeted Greeks of Azerbaijan with Soviet citizenship and took place in 1942 and 1949 respectively, as part of the Bolshevik campaign of "clearing the Caucasus from the politically untrustworthy elements."&lt;ref name="pilijov"/&gt;

===Since independence===
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, in the midst of political instability over 100 of the remaining Greeks left Azerbaijan. The Greek population of the village of Mehmana fled during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. In 1994, a Greek cultural centre was established in Baku at the initiative of the Greek ambassador. In 1997, it was reorganized into the Argo Greek Society. The community, which has largely lost the [[Pontic language]], presently numbers 535 people, both Greeks and descendants of mixed families.&lt;ref name="pilijov"/&gt;

[[File:Greenwich Time Signal pips.png|thumb|350px|Graph of the six pips]]

The '''Greenwich Time Signal''' ('''GTS'''), popularly known as '''the pips''', is a series of six short tones broadcast at one-second intervals by many [[BBC Radio]] [[List of BBC radio stations|stations]]. The pips were introduced in 1924 and have been generated by the BBC since 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jim |last=McIlroy |title=Network Radio: New Time and Frequency distribution system |url=http://www.bbceng.info/Eng_Inf/EngInf_40.pdf#page=5 |format=pdf |journal=Eng Inf |date=Spring 1990 |issue=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mark the precise start of each hour. Their utility in [[calibration]] is diminishing as digital broadcasting entails time lags.

==Structure==

{{Listen|filename=Gts_ (bbc)_pips.ogg|title=Greenwich Time Signal|description=The first five pips and 1 beep}}

There are six pips (short beeps) in total, which occur on each of the 5&amp;nbsp;seconds leading up to the hour and on the hour itself. Each pip is a 1 [[SI prefix|k]][[Hertz|Hz]] tone (about halfway between musical [[Scientific pitch notation#Table of note frequencies|B5 and C6]]) the first five of which last a tenth of a second each, while the final pip lasts half a second. The actual moment when the hour changes – the "on-time marker" – is at the very beginning of the last pip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the time?|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/what%27s-the-time|work=Astronomy &amp; Time|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055748/http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/what%27s-the-time|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[leap second]] occurs (exactly one second before midnight [[UTC]]), it is indicated by a seventh pip. In this case the first pip occurs at 23:59:55 (as usual) and there is a sixth short pip at 23:59:60 (the leap second) followed by the long pip at 00:00:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Leap second: Keeper of the pips |website=BBC News |date=30 December 2008 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7791709.stm |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The possibility of an extra pip for the leap second thus justifies the final pip being longer than the others, so that it is always clear which pip is on the hour.  Before leap seconds were conceived, the final pip was the same length as the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The comforting tone of the hourly radio pips |author= |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-26052087 |website=BBC News (Magazine Monitor) |date=5 February 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although "negative" leap seconds can also be used to make the year shorter, this has never happened in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leap years and leap seconds|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/leap-years|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055800/http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/leap-years|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjusting after a ‘long’ weekend at the Royal Observatory – Precision clocks and the leap second|url=http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/collections/2012/07/06/adjusting/|publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich|accessdate=5 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222055748/http://blogs.rmg.co.uk/collections/2012/07/06/adjusting/|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although normally broadcast only on the hour by BBC domestic radio, BBC World Service use the signal at other times as well. The signal is generated at each quarter-hour and has on occasion been broadcast in error.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Up to 1972 the pips were of equal length and confusion arose as to which was the final pip, hence the last pip was of extended length.

==Usage==
The pips are available to BBC radio stations every 15 minutes but except in rare cases, they are only broadcast on the hour, usually before news bulletins or news programmes. On [[BBC Radio 4]], the pips are broadcast every hour except at 18:00 and 00:00 and at 22:00 on Sundays (at the start of the Westminster Hour) when they are replaced by the [[Westminster chime]]s of [[Big Ben]] at the [[Palace of Westminster]]. No time signal is broadcast at 15:00 on Saturdays and at 10:00 and 11:00 on Sundays.   This is caused by the scheduling of the afternoon play on Saturday and the omnibus edition of ''[[The Archers]]'' on Sunday. On [[BBC Radio 2]], the pips are used at 07:00, 08:00, 17:00 and 19:00 on weekdays, at 07:00 and 08:00 on Saturdays and at 08:00 and 09:00 on Sundays.

The pips were used on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] during ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' at 06:30 just after the news, 09:00 as part of the Tedious Link feature, 10&amp;nbsp;am (at the end of the show) and often before ''[[Newsbeat]]''. As most stations only air the pips on the hour, ''The Chris Moyles Show'' was the only show where the pips were broadcast on the half-hour. [[Chris Moyles]] continues to use the pips at the beginning of his show on [[Radio X (United Kingdom)|Radio X]]. [[Zane Lowe]]'s Masterpieces, the playing of an album in its entirety, is begun with pips, and they also feature at 19:00 on Fridays to signify the start of the weekend and at 16:00 on Sundays to mark the start of ''[[The Official Chart|The Official Chart Show]]''. ''[[Devin Griffin|The Weekend Breakfast Show with Dev]]'' begins with the pips at 06:00, and they sometimes feature on the hour at other points during the show, and ''[[Gemma Cairney]]'s Early Breakfast Show'' begins with the pips. [[Devin Griffin|Dev's]] previous ''Early Breakfast Show'' also featured the pips at the beginning, and on the half-hour/hour at other points, particularly at 06:00 before or after the "I'm Here All Week" track. The pips are also used at 19:00 on Saturday evenings at the start of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1's]] 12-hour simulcast with digital station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]].

[[BBC Radio 3]] and [[BBC Radio Five Live]] do not currently feature the Greenwich Time Signal in their scheduled programming.

The [[BBC World Service]] broadcasts the pips every hour.

Pips can also be heard on many [[BBC Local Radio]] stations although their use is up to the discretion of individual stations. A rare quarter-hour Greenwich Time Signal can be heard at 05:15 weekdays on Wally Webb's programme on six BBC Local Radio stations in the east of England, as part of his "sychronised cup of tea" feature.

In 1999, pip-like sounds were incorporated into the themes written by composer [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]] to introduce [[BBC News|BBC Television News]] programmes. They are still used today on [[BBC One]], [[BBC World News]] and [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]].

The BBC does not allow the pips to be broadcast except as a time signal. Radio plays and comedies which have fictional news programmes use various methods to avoid playing the full six pips, ranging from simply fading in the pips to a version played on ''[[On the Hour]]'' in which the sound was made into a small tune between the pips. ''[[The News Quiz]]'' also featured a special Christmas pantomime edition where the pips went missing, and the problem was avoided there by only playing individual pips and not the whole set. The 2012 project ''Radio Reunited'', however, did use the pips not as a time signal, but simply to commemorate 90 years of BBC Radio.

==Accuracy==
The pips for national radio stations and some local radio stations are timed relative to [[UTC]], from an [[atomic clock]] in the basement of [[Broadcasting House]] synchronised with the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]]'s [[Time from NPL]] and [[GPS]]. On other stations, the pips are generated locally from a [[GPS]]-synchronised clock.

The BBC compensates for the time delay in both broadcasting and receiving equipment, as well as the time for the actual transmission. The pips are timed so that they are accurately received on [[long wave]] as far as {{convert|160|km|-1}} from the [[Droitwich AM transmitter]], which is the distance to [[Central London]].

As a pre-[[IRIG timecode|IRIG]] and pre-[[Network Time Protocol|NTP]] time transfer and transmission system, the pips have been a great technological success. In modern times, however, time can be transferred to systems with CPUs and operating systems by using BCD or some Unix Time variant.

Newer digital broadcasting methods have introduced even greater problems for the accuracy of use of the pips. On digital platforms such as [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], [[digital audio broadcasting|DAB]], satellite and the [[internet]], the pips—although ''generated'' accurately—are not ''heard'' by the listener exactly on the hour. The [[codec|encoding and decoding]] of the digital signal causes a delay, of usually between 2 and 8&amp;nbsp;seconds. In the case of satellite broadcasting, the [[Time of arrival|travel time]] of the signal to and from the satellite adds about another 0.25&amp;nbsp;seconds.

==History==
[[File:Greenwich Time Signal1970.jpg|thumb|right|The machine used to generate the pips in 1970]]
The pips have been broadcast daily since 5 February 1924,&lt;ref name="bbchist"&gt;{{citation
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/271319.stm
|publisher=[[BBC News]]
|title=Sci/Tech – Six pip salute

|accessdate=2009-04-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and were the idea of the [[Astronomer Royal]], Sir [[Frank Watson Dyson]], and the head of the BBC, [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]]. The pips were originally controlled by two mechanical clocks located in the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] that had electrical contacts attached to their [[pendulum|pendula]]. Two clocks were used in case of a breakdown of one. These sent a signal each second to the BBC, which converted them to the audible oscillatory tone broadcast.&lt;ref name="bbchist"/&gt;

The Royal Greenwich Observatory moved to [[Herstmonceux Castle]] in 1957 and the GTS equipment followed a few years later in the form of an electronic clock. Reliability was improved by renting two lines for the service between Herstmonceux and the BBC, with a changeover between the two at [[Broadcasting House]] if the main line became disconnected.

The tone sent on the lines was inverted: the signal sent to the BBC was a steady 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone when no pip was required, and no tone when a pip should be sounded. This let faults on the line be detected immediately by automated monitoring for loss of audio.

The Greenwich Time Signal was the first sound heard in the handover to the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]] during the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Beijing 2008 Olympics closing ceremony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Baton Passed to London for 2012 |first=Peter | last=Simpson |url=http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=3411&amp;section=latestnews |newspaper=South China Morning Post |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322024520/http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=3411&amp;section=latestnews |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pips were also broadcast by the [[BBC Television Service]], but this practice was discontinued by the 1960s.

To celebrate the 90th birthday of the pips on 5 February 2014, the ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme broadcast a sequence that included a re-working of the Happy Birthday melody using the GTS as its base sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01rqqkn|last=Lister|first=Charles|title=The 'time pips' at 90|date=5 February 2014|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crashing the pips==
The [[BBC]] discourages any other sound being broadcast at the same time as the pips; doing so is commonly known as 'crashing the pips'. This was most often referred to on [[Terry Wogan]]'s Radio 2 Breakfast show, although usually only in jest since the actual event happened rarely.&lt;ref name="sue"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pip, pip! Woman of Today is gone tomorrow |author=Tom Leonard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1386296/Pip-pip-Woman-of-Today-is-gone-tomorrow.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=28 February 2002 |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different BBC Radio stations approach this issue differently. Both BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 generally take a more laid-back approach with the pips, usually playing them over the closing seconds of a currently playing song or a jingle 'bed' (background music from a jingle), followed by their respective news jingles. Many BBC local radio stations also play the pips over the station's jingle. BBC Radio 4 is stricter. It is an almost entirely speech-based network; incidents at the end of the ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme regularly cause listeners' complaints.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

As a contribution to [[Comic Relief]]'s 2005 Red Nose Day, the BBC developed a "pips" ring-tone which can be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/arts/rednose_ringtones_20050307.shtml |title=The Radio 4 Pips – How you download the pips |date=March 2005 |work=[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today Programme]] |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Bailey]]'s BBC Rave includes the [[BBC News (TV channel)#Countdown sequence|BBC News theme]], which incorporates a variant of the pips (though not actually broadcast exactly on the hour). The footage can be seen on his DVD ''Part Troll''.

In the late 1980s Radio 1 featured the pips played over a station [[jingle]] during [[Jackie Brambles|Jakki Brambles]]' early show and [[Simon Mayo]]'s breakfast show. This was not strictly crashing the pips as they were not intended to be, or mistaken for, an accurate time signal.

==Technical problems==
At 8 am on 17 September 2008, to the surprise of [[John Humphrys]], the day's main presenter on the ''Today'' programme, and [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], who was standing in for Terry Wogan on Radio 2, the pips went adrift by 6&amp;nbsp;seconds, and broadcast seven pips rather than six. This was traced to a problem with the pip generator, which was 'repaired' by switching it off and on again.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Humphrys' surprise was probably because of his deliberate avoidance of crashing the pips with the help of an accurate clock in the studio.

A sudden total failure in the generation of the audio pulses that constitute the pips was experienced on 31 May 2011 and silence was unexpectedly broadcast in place of the 17:00 signal. The problem was traced to the power supply of the equipment which converts the signal from the atomic clocks into an audible signal.&lt;ref name=blog&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2011/06/what_happened_to_the_radio_4_p.html |title= What happened to the Radio 4 pips? |author= Denis Nowlan |date= 1 June 2011 |work= Radio 4 and 4 Extra Blog |publisher= BBC |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst repairs were underway the BBC elected to broadcast a "dignified silence" in place of the pips at 19:00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Radio 4's pips die |author= Harry Wallop |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8548683/Radio-4s-pips-die.html |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 31 May 2011 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 19:45 the same day the power supply was repaired&lt;ref name=blog/&gt; and the 20:00 pips were broadcast as normal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2011/05/bbc-radio-4-reports-on-pips-failure/ "The Pips return from a 3&amp;nbsp;hour break" ''Radio Today'' 31 May 2011] Retrieved 31 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar time signals elsewhere==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Many radio broadcasters around the world use the Greenwich Time Signal as a means to mark the start of the hour. The pips are used in both domestic and international commercial and public broadcasting. Many radio stations use six tones similar to those used by the BBC World Service; some shorten it to five, four, or three tones.

* [[Argentina]] – all news/talk stations (Radio Nacional, Radio Mitre, Radio Continental, Radio 10, Cadena 3, etc.) air the six pips similar to the BBC every hour, and 3 pips for every half-hour similar to Catalonia. Also some online radios like Comucosas Radio, plays the pips
* [[Australia]] – pips are used on [[ABC Radio National]] and [[ABC Local Radio]] at the top of every hour, as well as on [[Fairfax Media]] talkback stations- [[2UE]], [[3AW]], [[4BC]] and [[6PR]]. In Australia, the news pips are closer to 735Hz and each of the six pips lasts for half a second. After each pip, there is half a second of silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=ABC Radio incoming News sound|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-lsc29hkww|language=en|accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Brazil]] - Some news stations, like the national station [[Radio Bandeirantes]], and the regional stations [[Radio Guaíba]] and [[Radio Gaúcha]] broadcasts a similar time signal every 15 minutes. In Radio Bandeirantes, there is 5-pips signal (called as "fifth signal"). In Radio Gaúcha, is used a 4-pips signal every 15 minutes. 
* [[Canada]] – the [[National Research Council Time Signal]] is broadcast daily on [[Ici Radio-Canada Première]] at 12:00 EST/EDT and on [[CBC Radio One]] at 13:00 EST/EDT. It is Canada's longest running radio feature and has been broadcast every day since 5 November 1939.
* [[China]] – [[China National Radio]] and all local radio stations use a similar 6-pip time signal on the hour. 5 short lower-pitched (0.25 s, 800&amp;nbsp;Hz) pips are played to count down the final 5 seconds of the old hour, and a longer, higher-pitched (0.5 s, 1600&amp;nbsp;Hz) pip is played to mark the beginning of the new hour.
* [[Finland]] – on [[YLE]]'s radio services the pips are broadcast on the hour.
* [[France]] – the station [[France Inter]] broadcasts four very short pips every hour, which are almost invariably crashed. The last pip, which is as long as the other ones, marks the top of the hour. Some local stations of the [[France Bleu]] network also air four pips that are a little longer than Inter's.
* [[Germany]] – [[Deutschlandfunk]] broadcasts three beeps every hour, the last one being longer than the others; between 05:00 and 18:00 on weekdays they are broadcast every half-hour and sometimes omitted at 21:00 when there is no news programme scheduled. The sister station, Deutschlandfunk Kultur omitted Pips altogether with their rebrand in 2017.
* [[Hong Kong]] – a six-pip time signal is used on [[RTHK]]'s radio channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Synchronization with Hong Kong Time System|url=http://www.hko.gov.hk/gts/time/Clocksyn.htm|website=[[Hong Kong Observatory]]|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signals, which are provided by the [[Hong Kong Observatory]], are broadcast every half-hour during the day and on the hour at night, immediately before the news headline reports.
* [[Hungary]] – the national radio channel Kossuth broadcasts five stereophonic pips at the top of every hour, the fifth being longer than the others.
* [[India]] – six pips are used by [[All India Radio]] before starting its Delhi news bulletins.
* [[Ireland]] – six pips are broadcast before news bulletins at 07:00, 13:00 and 24:00 on [[RTÉ Radio 1]].
* [[Israel]] –  On Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation hourly radio news, 5 tones (part of a recording of Kol Israel's original beeps) play counting down to the hour. Right as the hour starts, a jingle starts playing, the end of which includes the IPBC's [[Sound trademark|sonic ident]] and an acapella singing the name of the broadcaster "Kan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z70Y_d2h25I|title=תאגיד השידור הציבורי "כאן"- אותות הפתיחה והסיום של החדשות ברדיו|publisher=YouTube|access-date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This jingle replaced the original 6 tones that played on [[Kol Israel]]'s hourly newscasts - six tones, with the sixth tone being longer. As of 2017 (when public broadcaster [[Israel Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] got shut down and replaced by the IPBC or "[[Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation|Kan]]"), the intro got changed and added a jingle.
* [[Italy]] – The National Italian Radio "Rai" uses 6 tones to signal exact time in all its stations. They differ in the timing: Rai Radio 1 tells the hour. Rai Radio 2 tells on the half hour (at 6:30, 7:30, 8:30, 10:30, 12:30, 13:30, 17:30, 19:30, 21:30 and 23:30). Rai Radio 3 signals the 45 minute of selected hours (at 6:45, 8:45, 13:45 and 18:45) All the signals come from the Istituto Metrologico di Torino, the national study centre for measure and time. Also on Rai Radio 2 and Rai Radio 3 tells at 6 o'clock on start the new day.
* [[Japan]] – [[NHK|NHK Television]] formerly used three short pips played at :57 to :59 of the clock ident and a longer three-second pip from :00 to :03 just before the start of news programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTXl_zR88OE|title=時報(TV Clock)|publisher=YouTube|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXGknxAjgj0|title=NHK　1987年　ニュースOP集|publisher=YouTube|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longer three-second pip can however be crashed shortly after the :00 mark on certain special events or if there was time constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWi7QS_vOps|title=昭和から平成への変わり目|publisher=YouTube|access-date=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Malaysia]] – [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]] radio stations use the pips hourly before the news broadcast but only the top-of-the-hour pip is sounded. Until late 2012, the time signal is simply a short pip on the 59th second before the hour and a longer pip on the top of the hour. In a news report in [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] on 1 January 1982, the pips were used to sound similar to the BBC's.
* [[Netherlands]] – only three pips (two pips and one beep) were used from 1991 to 2018. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4324/Nieuws/article/detail/1315658/2007/08/04/De-rode-lopers-van-de-radio.dhtml De rode lopers van de radio] – book review in [[Trouw]] (4 August 2007, in Dutch). &lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast of the pips has stopped with the last transmission at 7:00 on 2 October 2018.
* [[New Zealand]] – the equivalent of BBC Radio 4, [[Radio New Zealand National]], plays the six pips at the top of every hour.
* [[North Korea]] – the pips are heard on [[Voice of Korea]] before its startup at 17:00.
* [[Poland]] – Polish radio tells 5 pips and 1 beep before the hour. Not broadcasting in Polskie Radio Jedynka on Every Sunday's, 3 May (Polish Constitution Day), 15 August (Polish Armed Forces Day) and 11 November (Polish Independence Day) at 9:00 in the morning, because broadcasting The Holly Mass.
* [[Russia]] - Russia's state television [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]] broadcasts 6 tones (at the end of a short melody) before newscasts and [[Vremya]] (the primetime news program).
* [[Sindh]] The [[Sindhi language]] news channel [[KTN News]] plays 5 pips at the start of each news hour.
* [[Spain]] – the signal is broadcast by almost all radio stations, even by music stations, but depends on the frequency: music stations usually use pips on the hour, but most of the non-musical stations broadcast the signal every 30&amp;nbsp;minutes. Los [[40 Principales]], the most important music radio in Spain, broadcast a different version of GTS: two first pips sound and then a music is added on the background, using the rhythm to create the corporative jingle of the radio. This station in particular uses only 4 pips, typically the two last using two different frequencies (resulting in a modern rhythm). Other musical radios like [[Máxima FM]] and [[M80 Radio]], both owned by [[PRISA]], and Europa FM use a similar effect.
** [[Catalonia]], Spain – dance music station Flaix FM and Hot AC station Ràdio Flaixbac, both owned by the same media group, broadcast every half-hour a very short sequence of two very short tones followed by a longer one, the whole lasting not more than one and a half seconds. Els 40 Principals, the Catalan edition of Spanish radio Los [[40 Principales]], use the same jingle, using a mix of GTS and corporative music.
* [[Sri Lanka]] – [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] uses GTS pips on their radio channels to mark the start of the hour at each main newscast just after playing the news theme music. Other stations do not use pips.
* [[Switzerland]] – The first channel of the Swiss radio used to play three short pips, the third being higher than the others. It seems to have disappeared now.
* [[United States]] – the pips can be heard on the [[Middlebury College]] radio station [[WRMC]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}  [[CBS News Radio]] broadcasts a single tone on the hour before the hourly news broadcast.
* former [[Yugoslavia]] – JRT broadcast the six pips before the news (on the hour) on radio as well as on television, before the start of the ''TV Dnevnik'' at 8:00 pm. The broadcast on TV was stopped in 1974 because the ''TV Dnevnik'' was moved to its current term at the bottom of the hour (7:30 pm).

== Early ancestors of Indo-Fijians ==

=== First Indian in Fiji ===
{{main article|Lascars in Fiji}}
Indians had been employed for a long time on the European ships trading in India and the [[East Indies]]. Many of the early voyages to the Pacific either started or terminated in India, and many of these ships were wrecked in the uncharted waters of the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. The first recorded presence of an Indian in Fiji was by [[Peter Dillon]], a [[sandalwood]] trader in Fiji, of a [[lascar]] (Indian seaman) who survived a ship wreck and lived amongst the natives of Fiji in 1813.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davidson |first=J.W. |authorlink= |author2= |title=Peter Dillon of Vanikoro: Chevalier of the South Seas |year=1975 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Melbourne|isbn= 0-19-550457-7|pages = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First attempt to procure Indian labourers ===
Before Fiji was colonized by Great Britain, some planters had tried to obtain Indian labour and had approached the British Consul in [[Levuka]], Fiji but were met with a negative response. In 1870 a direct request by a planter to the [[Government of India]] was also turned down and in 1872, an official request by the [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau|Cakobau]] Government was informed that British rule in Fiji was a pre-condition for Indian emigration to Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillion |first=K. L. |authorlink= |author2= |title=Fiji's Indian Migrants: A history to the end of indenture in 1920 |year=1962 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Melbourne|isbn= 0-19-550452-6|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The early ancestors of Fiji Indians came from different regions and backgrounds from India and other neighbouring countries. However, most came from rural villages in northern and
southern India.

In January 1879, thirty-one Indians, who had originally been indentured labourers in [[Réunion]], were brought from [[New Caledonia]] to Fiji under contract to work on a plantation in [[Taveuni]]. These labourers demonstrated knowledge of the terms of the indenture agreement and were aware of their rights and refused to do the heavy work assigned to them. Their contract was terminated by mutual agreement between the labourers and their employers. In 1881, thirty-eight more Indians arrived from New Caledonia and again most of them left but some stayed taking Indian wives or island women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillion |first=K. L. |authorlink= |author2= |title=Fiji's Indian Migrants: A history to the end of indenture in 1920 |year=1962 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Melbourne|isbn= 0-19-550452-6|pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrival under the indentured system ===
{{main article|Indian indenture system}}
The colonial authorities promoted the [[sugar cane]] industry, recognising the need to establish a stable economic base for the colony, but were unwilling to exploit indigenous labour and threaten the [[Culture of Fiji|Fijian way of life]]. The use of imported labour from the Solomon Islands and what is now Vanuatu generated protests in the United Kingdom, and the [[Governor of Fiji|Governor]] [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon]] decided to implement the indentured labour scheme, which had existed in the [[British Empire]] since 1837. A recruiting office was set up especially around Calcutta and the South, West and North later, especially a lot in rural village areas in different farming regions, land and areas.

The ''[[Leonidas (ship)|Leonidas]]'', a labour transport vessel, disembarked at Levuka from Calcutta on 14 May 1879. The 463 [[indentured worker]]s who disembarked were the first of over 61,000 to arrive from South and East Asia in the following 37 years. The majority were from the districts of eastern and southern provinces, followed by labourers from northern and western regions, then later south eastern countries, they originated from different regions, villages, backgrounds and castes that later mingled or intermarried hence the "Fijian Indian" identity was created. The indentured workers originated mostly from rural village backgrounds.
.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Life during the indenture period ==
The contracts of the indentured labourers, which they called ''girmit'' (agreements), required them to work in Fiji for a period of five years. Living conditions on the sugar cane plantations, on which most of the ''[[girmityas]]'' (indentured labourers) worked, had poor standards which resembled that of slavery. Hovels known as "coolie lines" dotted the landscape.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== End of indenture ==
Public outrage in the United Kingdom at such abuses was a factor in the decision to halt the scheme in 1916. All existing indenture was cancelled on 1 January 1920.

== Emergence of the Fiji Indian identity ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
After a further five years of work as an indentured labourer or as a ''khula'' (free labourer), they were given the choice of returning to India at their own expense, or remain in Fiji. The great majority opted to stay because they could not afford to return under the low pay (even in many instances they were denied paid wages) of the British government or were refused to be sent back. After the expiry of their ''girmits'', many leased small plots of land from Fijians and developed their own sugarcane fields or cattle farmlets. Others went into business in the towns that were beginning to spring up.

The indenture system had two positive effects on subsequent generations. Firstly the need for people of different castes to live work and eat together led to an end of the caste system. Furthermore, shortage of females resulted in many marrying outside their caste. Another positive was the development of a new [[koiné language]], known as [[Fiji Hindi]] that was formed from different languages and dialects of India. The speakers of these languages originated from different regions in India that supplied a lot of labourers. Music too, was important, with a distinct Fiji Hindi culture that some commentators have described as a forerunner to both bangla and jazz. For the most part, these people came from in certain rural or village areas. The language was further heavily enriched by the inclusion of many [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and English words. The language is now the mother tongue of majority Fiji Indians and is the [[lingua franca]] of not only all the Fiji Indians but also of all Fijian communities where ethnic Indians are in a majority.

== Free immigrants ==
From the early 1900s, Indians started arriving in Fiji as free agents. Many of these paid their own way and had previously served in Fiji or other British colonies or had been born in Fiji. Amongst the early free migrants, there were religious teachers, missionaries and at least one lawyer. The government and other employers brought clerks, policemen, artisans, gardeners, experienced agricultural workers, a doctor and a school teacher. Punjabi farmers and Gujarati craftsmen also paid their own way to Fiji and in later year years formed an influential minority amongst the Fiji Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillion |first=K.

== Indian Platoon during the Second World War ==
In 1916, Manilal Doctor, the de facto leader of the Fiji Indians persuaded the colonial government of Fiji to form an Indian platoon for the war effort during the First World War. He sent the names of 32 volunteers to the government but his requests were ignored. As a result, a number of Fiji Indians volunteered for the New Zealand Army while one served in Europe during the First World War.

In 1934, Governor Fletcher, enacted a policy which warranted an [[Indian Platoon]] within the Fiji Defence Force consisting entirely of [[Enlisted rank|enlisted-ranked]] Indians. Governor Fletcher encouraged Indians to regard Fiji as their permanent home. One could say this was Governor Fletcher's insurance policy against an anticipated anti-European revolt at the hands of the Native population, which subsequently took place in 1959.

While the Fiji Indian troops had the Europeans as their commanding and non-commissioned officers, the Native Fijians had [[Colonial Fiji|Ratu Edward Cakobau]], a Native Fijian, as their commanding officer. Prior to World War II, soldiers served voluntarily and were paid "capitation grants" according to efficiency ratings without regard to race. In 1939, during the mobilisation of the Fiji Defence Force, the British Royal Military changed its payment system to four shillings per day for enlisted men of European descent while enlisted men of non-European descent were paid only two shillings per day. Indian platoon readily disputed this disparity in pay. The British, fearing this dissidence would eventually be shared by the Native Fijians, decided to disband the Indian platoon in 1940 citing lack of available equipment, such as military armour, as their reason.

== Name debate ==
Indians are defined by the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|constitution of Fiji]] as anybody who can trace, through either the male or the female line, their ancestry back to anywhere on the [[Indian subcontinent]] and all government documents use this name. However, a number of names have been proposed to distinguish Fiji-born [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|citizens of Indian origin]] both from the [[Fijians|indigenous inhabitants of Fiji]] and from India-born immigrants. Among the more popular proposals are '''Fiji Indian''' and '''Indo-Fijian'''. These labels have proved culturally and politically controversial, and finding a label of identification for the Indian community in Fiji has fuelled a debate that has continued for many decades. Other proposed names have been '''Fiji Indian''' and '''Fiji Born Indian'''.

=== Fiji Indians versus indigenous Fijians ===
In the late 1960s the leader of the [[National Federation Party]], [[A. D. Patel]], who used the slogan, "One Country, One People, One Destiny" suggested that all Fiji's citizens should be called Fijians and to distinguish the original inhabitants from the rest, the name ''[[Fijians]]'' should be used for native Fijians. There was widespread opposition to this from the native Fijians who feared that any such move would deprive them of the special [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s they had enjoyed since cession in 1874. The ''[[Fiji Times]]'' started using '''[[Fiji Islander]]''' to describe all Fiji's citizens but this name did not catch on.

The United States [[Department of State]] gives the nationality of Fiji citizens as ''"Fiji Islander"'' and states that "the term "Fijian" has exclusively ethnic connotations and should not be used to describe any thing or person not of indigenous Fijian descent."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1834.htm US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;

As the labels carry emotional and (according to some) politically loaded connotations, they are listed below in alphabetical order.

=== Fiji Indian ===
For a long time '''Fiji Indian''' was used to distinguish between Fiji citizens of Indian origin and Indians from India. The term was used by writers like [[K.L. Gillion]] and by the academic and politician, [[Ahmed Ali (politician)|Ahmed Ali]]. The late [[President of Fiji]], [[Ratu]] Sir [[Kamisese Mara]], also used this term in his speeches and writings. The term was also used by the [[Methodist Church of Fiji and Rotuma]], Fiji's largest Christian denomination, which had a Fiji-Indian division.

=== Indo-Fijian ===
This term has been used by such writers as [[Adrian Mayer]] and [[Brij Lal (historian)|Brij Lal]]. Ratu [[Joni Madraiwiwi]], Fiji's [[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] from 2004 to 2006, also used it in his speeches.

In 2006, [[Jone Navakamocea]], Minister of State for National Planning in the [[Laisenia Qarase|Qarase]] government, called for the use of the term "Indo-Fijian" to be officially banned. He declared that the term was "unacceptable", and that Indo-Fijians should be referred to only as "Indians". The ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' reported Navakamocea had "alleged that the Indo-Fijian term was coined by Indian academics in Fiji to 'Fijianise' their Indian ethnicity", which, in Navakamocea's view, undermined the paramountcy of indigenous rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hindustandainik.in/news/5967_1761335,001600060017.htm "Ban the term Indo-Fijian: Minister"], ''Hindustan Times'', 5 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Navakamocea lost office in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|2006 military coup]] when the army accused the Qarase government of anti-Fijian Indian racism and overthrew it.

== Political participation: early 20th century ==
The colonial rulers attempted to assuage Indian discontent by providing for one of their number to be nominated to the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] from 1916 onwards. [[Badri Maharaj]], a strong supporter of the British Empire but with little support among his own people, was appointed by the Governor in 1916. His appointment did little to redress the grievances of the Indian community. Buttressed by the [[Indian Imperial Association]] founded by [[Manilal Doctor|Manilal Maganlal]], a lawyer who had arrived in Fiji in 1912, the Indians continued to campaign for better work and living conditions, and for an extension of the [[Local government in Fiji|municipal]] franchise; literacy tests disqualified most Indians from participation. A strike by Indian municipal workers and Public Works Department employees, which began on 15 January 1920, ended in a riot which was forcibly quelled on 12 February; Manilal, widely blamed for the unrest, was deported. Another strike, from January to July in 1921, led by ''[[Sadhu]]'' (priest) [[Vashist Muni]], demanded higher rates of pay for workers of the [[Colonial Sugar Refining Company (Fiji)|Colonial Sugar Refining Company]] (CSR), the unconditional return of Manilal, and the release of imprisoned 1920 strikers. The authorities responded by deporting Muni from Fiji.

Demands increased for direct representation in the legislature.  In 1929, Indian immigrants and their descendants were authorised to elect three members to the Legislative Council on a [[Communal constituencies|communal roll]]. [[Vishnu Deo]], [[James Ramchandar Rao|James Ramchandar]] and [[Parmanand Singh]] were duly elected.  Agitation continued for a [[Open constituencies|common roll]], which the colonial administrators rejected, citing the fears of European settlers and Fijian chiefs that a common electoral roll would lead to political domination by Indians, whose numbers were rapidly increasing.

== Religious and social divisions: 1920–1945 ==
[[File:Srisivasubramaniya temple nadi fiji.jpg|thumb|The [[Sri Siva Subramaniya temple]], a South-Indian type temple in the Indo-Fijian town of [[Nadi]].]]
Two major [[Hinduism|Hindu]] movements attracted widespread support in the 1920s, and relationships between Hindus and Muslims also became increasingly strained.

The [[Arya Samaj in Fiji]] advocated purging Hinduism of what it saw as its superstitious elements and expensive rituals, opposed child marriage, and advocated the remarriage of widows, which orthodox Hinduism didn't promote at that time. The Arya Samaj also encouraged education for girls, which wasn't the norm at the time. The Arya Samaj began by establishing schools and by using a newspaper of one of its supporters, the [[Fiji Samachar]] founded in 1923, to expound their views.

The traditional [[Sanatana Dharma|Sanatan Dharma]], was more orthodox than the Hindu-reformist Arya Samaj. It affirmed traditional Hindu rituals and prayers. However, Fijian Indians who practice Sanatana Dharma also do not have child marriages, as it is unheard of until the youths reach maturity age or level.

== Developments since 1945 ==
[[File:Saris on sale in Lautoka, Fiji.jpg|thumb|[[Sari]]s on sale in [[Lautoka]], [[Viti Levu]].]]
A post-war effort by European members of the Legislative Council to repatriate ethnic Indians to India, starting with sixteen-year-old males and fourteen-year-old females, was not successful, but reflected the tensions between Fiji's ethnic communities.

Differences between ethnic Fijians and Indians complicated preparations for Fiji independence, which the United Kingdom granted in 1970, and have continued to define [[Politics of Fiji|Fiji politics]] since. Prior to independence, Indians sought a common electoral roll, based on the principle of "one man, one vote."  Ethnic Fijian leaders opposed this, believing that it would favour urban voters who were mostly Indian; they sought a communal franchise instead, with different ethnic groups voting on separate electoral rolls. At a specially convened conference in London in April 1970, a compromise was worked out, under which parliamentary seats would be allocated by ethnicity, with ethnic Fijians and Indians represented equally. In the [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]], each ethnic group was allocated 22 seats, with 12 representing ''Communal constituencies'' (elected by voters registered as members of their particular ethnic group) and a further 10 representing ''[[National constituencies]]'' (distributed by ethnicity but elected by [[universal suffrage]]. A further 8 seats were reserved for [[General electors|ethnic minorities]], 3 from "communal" and 5 from "national" constituencies.

In 1987, shortly after a coalition government was formed that represented both communities, two military coups were staged by low-ranking Fijian officers that aimed at sidelining the Indian community in politics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jet6JOYjZ4wC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Indians+Fiji&amp;ots=bX3yJinEUw&amp;sig=5kIUFAbkma1GCLGy3ofIXYqInMk#v=onepage&amp;q=Indians%20Fiji&amp;f=false Victor Lal, "The Fiji Indians: Marooned at Home," in ''South Asians Overseas: Migration and Ethnicity'' Cambridge University Press, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic Indians outnumbered indigenous Fijians from 1956 through the late 1980s. This was due to the death of 1/3 of the indigenous population, mainly male and children, that died from smallpox contracted when King Cakobau and other chief leaders returned from a trip from Australia during which they caught smallpox. The percentage of Indigenous female population increased as a result, and the native male population was scarce at one stage,&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology for beginners By Reinhard Renneberg, Arnold L. Demain&lt;/ref&gt; but by 2000 their share of the population had declined to 43.7%, because of a higher ethnic-Fijian birthrate and particularly because of the greater tendency of Fijian Indians to emigrate. Emigration accelerated following the coups of 1987 (which removed an Indian-supported government from power and, for a time, ushered in a constitution that discriminated against them in numerous ways) and [[2000 Fijian coup d'état|of 2000]] (which removed an Indian [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]] from office).

Political differences between the two communities, rather than ideological differences, have characterised Fijian politics since independence, with the two communities generally voting for different political parties. The National Federation Party founded by A.D. Patel, was the party favoured overwhelmingly by the Indian community throughout most of the nation's history, but its support collapsed in the [[Fiji general election, 1999|parliamentary election]] of 1999, when it lost all of its seats in the House of Representatives; its support fell further still in the [[Fijian general election, 2001|2001 election]], when it received only 22% of the Indian vote, and in the [[Fijian general election, 2006|2006 election]], when it dropped to an all-time low of 14%. The party formerly favoured by Indians was the [[Fiji Labour Party]], led by [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], which received about 75% of the Indian vote in 2001, and won all 19 seats reserved for Indians. Founded as a multi-racial party in the 1980s, it was supported mostly by Indians, but has seen no representation in parliament since the coup of 2006.

== Impact of the Church and religious/ethnic politics ==
The Church plays a major role in Fiji politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=52499 Let us pray, churches say], Fiji Times Online, 29 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Often some leaders appeal to Fijians addressing them as "Christians", even though Hindus are 33% of the
population in Fiji, compared with 52% Christians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1834.htm Background Note: Fiji], Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, September 2006, U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2000 Fijian coup d'état]] that removed the elected PM Mahendra Chaudhry, was supported by the Methodist church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?id=18901&amp;op=read Fiji military dismisses GCC and Methodist support for reconciliation bill], Radio New Zealand International, 25 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Methodist Church authorities have continued to advocate the establishment of a Christian state. In a letter of support from the then head of the Methodist Church, Reverend Tomasi Kanilagi, to George Speight, the leader of 19 May 2000, armed takeover of Parliament, Reverend Kanilagi publicly expressed his intention to use the Methodist Church as a forum under which to unite all ethnic Fiji political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/23828.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2003], Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; The Methodist church also supported forgiveness to those who plotted the coup in form of so-called "[[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill]]".

In 2005, Methodist church general secretary Reverend [[Ame Tugaue]] argued that practice of Hinduism and other religions should not be guaranteed in law:

:"Sodom and Gomorrah were only destroyed after the Lord removed the faithful from there and not because of a few would we allow God's wrath to befall the whole of Fiji. It was clearly stated in the 10 Commandments that God gave to Moses that Christians were not allowed to worship any other gods and not to worship idols. One thing other religions should be thankful for is that they are tolerated in Fiji as it's naturally a peaceful place but their right of worship should never be made into law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=NEWS&amp;id=1112408217 christianaggression.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926230135/http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=NEWS&amp;id=1112408217 |date=26 September 2007 }}, extract from Fiji Times, 27 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] in Fiji, which deposed the government of [[Laisenia Qarase]] (which Indians claimed as unsympathetic to Indian interests), Reverend [[Tuikilakila Waqairatu]] of the Fiji Council of Churches and Assembly of Christian Churches has stated that the coup is "un-Christian" and is "manifestation of darkness and evil". He claimed that "52% of Fijians are Christian and the country's Christian values are being undermined."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200612061204/fiji_military_monitoring_the_media Fiji military monitoring the media] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118042641/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/latest/200612061204/fiji_military_monitoring_the_media |date=18 January 2012 }}, Radio New Zealand, 6 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographic factors ==
Indo Fijians are concentrated in the so-called Sugar Belt and in cities and towns on the northern and western coasts of [[Viti Levu]] and [[Vanua Levu]]; their numbers are much scarcer in the south and inland areas. The majority of Fijian Indians came from northern and southeastern part of India and converse in what is known as the [[Fiji Hindi]] language that has been coined from the eastern Hindi dialects mixed with some native Fijian and small numbers of English words,&lt;ref&gt;Moag, Rodney F. (1977). Fiji Hindi: A basic course and reference grammar. Canberra: Australian National University. {{ISBN|0-7081-1574-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with some minorities speaking [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], and many who speak [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as their mother tongue with less fluency.&lt;ref&gt;Languages of fiji.pdf, Sangam conventional Magazine, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all Indians are also fluent in English.

According to the 1996 census (the latest available), 76.7% of Indians are [[Hindu]]s and a further 15.9% are [[Muslim]]s.  Christians comprise 6.1% of the Indian population, while about 0.9% are members of the [[Sikh]] faith. The remaining 0.4% are mostly nonreligious.

Hindus in Fiji belong mostly to the [[Sanātana Dharma]] sect (74.3% of all Hindus); a minority (3.7%) follow [[Arya Samaj in Fiji|Arya Samaj]]. Smaller groups, including The [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], and numerous unspecified Hindu sects, comprise 22% of the Hindu population. Muslims are mostly [[Sunni]] (59.7%) or unspecified (36.7%); there is an [[Ahmadiya]] minority (3.6%). Indian Christians are a diverse body, with [[Methodism|Methodists]] forming the largest group (26.2%), followed by the [[Assemblies of God]] (22.3%), [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] (17%), and [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] (5.8%). The remaining 28.7% belong to a medley of denominations. There is an [[Indian Division of the Methodist Church in Fiji]]. About 5000 Indians are Methodist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/downloads/wc_fiji03.pdf|title=Methodist Church In Britain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are part of the Methodist Church in Fiji and support the position of the Methodist Church in Fiji,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=53198|title=The Fiji Times » Page not found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the rights of Indians.

== Emigration ==
Former Prime Minister Chaudhry has expressed alarm at the high rate of emigration of educated Fiji-Indians. ''"If the trend continues, Fiji will be left with a large pool of poorly educated, unskilled work force with disastrous consequences on our social and economic infrastructure and levels of investment,"'' he said on 19 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/indo-fijians-and-fijis-coup-culture/|title=Indo-Fijians and Fiji’s Coup Culture|first=Grant Wyeth, The|last=Diplomat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He blamed the coups of 1987 for "brain drain" which has, he said, adversely affected the sugar industry, the standard of the education and health services, and the efficiency of the civil service.

== Health issues ==

Fiji Indians face major obstacles when it comes to health. They are often cited in research articles as a group that has a higher than normal prevalence rate of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3867/is_200703/ai_n19432253 Ethnicity, Type 2 Diabetes and Migrant Asian Indians], Indian Journal of Medical Research, 6 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Internal Market Information System''' (IMI) is an IT-based network that links public bodies in the [[European Economic Area]]. It was developed by the [[European Commission]] together with the [[Member States of the European Union]] to speed up cross-border administrative cooperation. IMI allows public administrations at national, regional and local level to identify their counterparts in other countries and to exchange information with them. Pre-translated questions and answers as well as [[machine translation]] make it possible for them to use their own language to communicate.

==Background==
[[Internal Market|Internal market]] legislation of the [[European Union]] (EU) makes it mandatory for competent authorities in Member States to assist their counterparts abroad by providing them with information. Some legislation also requires communication between Member States and the European Commission (for example for the notification of national implementing measures of [[European Union law]]). IMI has been developed in order to facilitate this day-to-day exchange of information.

IMI was launched in February 2008. Development and maintenance has been funded by the programme [[Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations]] (ISA) since July 2010. ISA is the successor to the [[IDABC]] program, which initially funded IMI and came to an end on 31 December 2009.  

IMI is one of the governance tools of the Single Market. Other such tools are Your Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/youreurope/index.htm |title=Your Europe website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Your Europe Advice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/citizensrights/front_end/about/index_en.htm |title=your Europe Advice website}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solvit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/solvit/ |title=SOLVIT website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Points of Single Contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/eu-go/index_en.htm |title=Points of Single Contact website}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
IMI applies a "[[Privacy by Design]]" approach – integrating privacy and data protection compliance in all stages of the design of IMI – which has been developed in consultation with the [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] (EDPS).
Administrative coordination is legally determinate and provided in a form of legal assistance between responsible [[institutions]]. In the case of the IMI system, administrative coordination encompasses some modes of administrative [[cooperation]] related to information provision ([[information exchange]] or [[data]] provision); shared administrative procedures execution (obligation to execute a single administrative decision/act by an institution from different Member States) and [[Business networking|networking]] on a specific institutional structure (working of [[Government agency|agencies]] or groups in formalised [[policy]] [[implementation]] processes)&lt;ref&gt;Civinskas, R., Dvorak, J., Guogis, A. (2017). The Administrative Side of Industrial Relations in Selected EU Countries: Case of Posted Workers. Montenegrin Journal of Economics, Vol. 13 (4), p. 131-147 http://www.mnje.com/sites/mnje.com/files/131_-_148_-_z_12_-_civinskas_et_al.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Actors==
IMI has been rolled out in a decentralised way. Therefore, the practical implementation of IMI is the responsibility of the individual Member States. There are several actors that play a role in the IMI network.

===Competent Authorities===
Competent authorities are the end users of IMI. They are public bodies that have been given the responsibility to deal with certain elements of application of internal market legislation. They can function on national, regional or local level.

===IMI Coordinators===
There is one national IMI coordinator (NIMIC) per Member State, often located in a national ministry. Their task is to ensure the smooth operation of IMI in their country. IMI coordinators may delegate some of their responsibilities to additional coordinators who are in charge of, for example, one legislative area or a geographical region, depending on each Member State’s administrative structures.

===European Commission===
The [[European Commission]] is responsible for maintenance and development of the tool, helpdesk services and training. It also manages and supports the network of IMI coordinators, promotes further expansion of IMI and reports on the functioning of the system. 

==IMI Workflows==
IMI offers a number of workflows to its users in order to facilitate different types of administrative cooperation across the [[Member states of the European Economic Area]]. 

===Information requests===
When a competent authority needs information from a counterpart abroad, it can send a request for information. This exchange mechanism uses lists of pre-translated questions and answers available in all EU languages. It is also possible to attach documents. Only the competent authorities that are directly involved in an information exchange have access to the content. A practical example of an information request is when a German teacher would like to continue his activities in [[Portugal]]. The Portuguese authority needs to verify the authenticity of his scanned diploma. It can then use IMI to send an information request to its partner authority in [[Germany]]. This authority can accept the request and send an answer back to the authority in Portugal. Due to the pre-translated question and answer sets, both authorities can communicate in their own language.

===Notifications===
Notifications are based on one-to-many information exchanges where authorities can alert or notify one or more competent authorities and/or the [[European Commission]]. For example, the [[Services Directive]] requires that Member States alert each other of possible dangers to the health and safety of people or to the environment caused in the provision of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:376:0036:0068:en:PDF |title=Directive on Services in the Internal Market |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information repositories===
IMI information repositories are databases storing specific information for certain policy areas. An example of such a repository is the directory of registers maintained by competent authorities throughout the [[European Economic Area]]. This directory is equipped with multilingual search functions. The content of a repository can be accessed either by a restricted group of competent authorities or by all IMI users.

==Legal Framework==
IMI is used in all Member States of the European Economic Area for the administrative cooperation required by the Directive on the Recognition of Professional Qualifications (2005/36/EC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/index_en.htm |title=Free movement of professionals - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Directive on services in the internal market]] (2006/123/EC)  and, on a pilot basis, by the Posting of Workers Directive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=471 |title=Posted workers - European Commission |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since November 2012, it provides a repository for information on licence holders for the cross-border road transport of Euro cash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:316:0001:0020:EN:PDF |title=Regulation on the cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro-area Member States  |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an IT platform for the problem solving network [[Solvit]]. IMI is being expanded to cover further legislative areas. For example, the Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross-border Healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:0045:0065:EN:PDF |title=Directive on Patients' Rights in Cross-border Healthcare |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
IMI aims to "become a flexible toolkit at the service of administrative cooperation, contributing to the improved governance of the [[Internal Market]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/imi-net/docs/strategy_paper_en.pdf |title=Communication on Better governance of the Single Market through greater administrative cooperation |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The IMI Regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32012R1024:EN:NOT |title=Regulation on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System  |date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came into force in December 2012 is an EU law establishing a comprehensive legal framework for IMI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europolitics.info/sectorial-policies/new-rules-for-imi-take-effect-art345947-17.html |title=New rules for IMI take effect |publisher=europolitics.info |date=2012-12-05 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a complete set of rules for the processing of personal data in IMI and prescribes a method for future expansion of IMI to additional policy areas.

'''Kerek''' ({{lang-ru|Керекский язык}}) is an extinct language of [[Russia]] of the northern branch of the [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages]]. On historical linguistic grounds it is most closely related to [[Koryak language|Koryak]] (both languages have a [[Phonemic differentiation#Phonemic mergers|merger]] of the proto-Chuktotian [[phonemes]] /*ð/ and /*r/ with /*j/). The next closest relative is Chukchi (/*ð/ and /*r/ are merged, but not /*j/).

In 1997 there were still two speakers remaining, but by 2005 the language was considered extinct.&lt;ref&gt;Fortescue, Michael 2005. ''Comparative Chukotko-Kamchatkan Dictionary''. Berlin / New York: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2010 census,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/population/demo/per-itog/tab6.xls 2010 census]&lt;/ref&gt; there were 10 people claiming Kerek as their native language, a number which may include partial speakers and non-speakers who claim the language as part of their ethnic heritage. Over the 20th century many members of the [[Kereks|Kerek ethnic group]] [[Language shift|shifted]] to [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], the language of the majority ethnic group in the area, but now most [[Chukchi people|Chukchis]] and [[Kereks]] speak [[Russian language|Russian]].

Kerek is an agglutinative language, meaning that the morphemes build on each other to have different meanings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lingsib.iea.ras.ru/en/languages/kerek.shtml|title=Endangered Languages of Siberia - The Kerek Language|website=lingsib.iea.ras.ru|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kingdom of Burundi''' ({{lang-fr|Royaume du Burundi}}) or '''Kingdom of Urundi''' (''Royaume d'Urundi'') was a [[polity]] ruled by a [[traditional authority|traditional monarch]] in modern-day [[Burundi|Republic of Burundi]] in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]] of [[East Africa]]. The kingdom, majority ethnic [[Hutu]], was ruled by a monarch from the [[Tutsi|Tutsi ethnic group]] with the title of ''[[mwami]]''. Created in the 17th century, the kingdom was preserved under [[Western European colonialism and colonization|European colonial rule]] in the late 19th and early 20th century and was an independent state between 1962 and 1966.

==History==
The date of the foundation of the Kingdom of Burundi is unknown but probably dates back to the 17th century when the [[Tutsi|Tutsi ethnic group]] gained dominance over the larger [[Hutu|ethnic Hutu]] population of the region. Under ''mwami'' [[Ntare I]] ({{Reign}}1675–1705), the kingdom expanded and annexed a number of surrounding polities.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |title= Kingdom of Burundi |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingdom-of-Burundi |access-date= 15 October 2016 |edition= Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ruled by the ''mwami'', the kingdom was extensively decentralised and local sub-rulers had wide independence. Before the arrival of European colonists, succession struggles were also common.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

In 1890, Burundi became part of the [[German colonial empire]] as part of [[German East Africa]] but was not effectively occupied or controlled by the colonial power. During [[World War I]], Belgian troops from the neighbouring [[Belgian Congo]] invaded the region and occupied it. The Belgians were awarded Burundi, together with the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], as an [[League of Nations mandates|international mandate]] by the [[League of Nations]]. The Belgians, however, preserved many of the kingdom's institutions intact.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

Whereas the similar Rwandan monarchy [[Rwandan Revolution|was abolished in a revolution]] between 1959 and 1961, the Burundian monarchy succeeded in surviving into the post-colonial period. In 1962, the Kingdom of Burundi regained its independence as a [[constitutional monarchy]] in which the ''mwami'' held executive power and legislative power was given to the parliament.&lt;ref name=EISA&gt;{{cite web|title=
Burundi: Fall of the Monarchy (1962 - 1966)|url=https://eisa.org.za/wep/buroverview4.htm|publisher=African Democracy Encyclopaedia Project|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic violence between the Hutu majority and the Tutsi minority rose, however, between 1963 and 1965 and culminated with a [[1965 Burundian coup d'état|failed coup d'état]] against the monarchy of [[Mwambutsa IV Bangiriceng of Burundi|Mwambutsa IV]] in 1965. Mwambutsa's son, [[Ntare V of Burundi|Ntare V]], deposed his father in a [[July 1966 Burundian coup d'état|July 1966 coup d'état]], but was himself ousted from power in a [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'état|November 1966 coup d'état]] by his Prime Minister, [[Michel Micombero]], who abolished the monarchy.&lt;ref name=EISA/&gt;

==Legacy==
Most members of the royal house live in exile in [[France]] today. In the 2005 elections, [[Princess Esther Kamatari]] ran for president for the [[Abahuza|Party for the Restoration of Monarchy and Dialogue in Burundi]] (Abahuza). Supporters believe that a restoration of a [[constitutional monarchy]] could help to ease the country's ethnic tensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro-monarchy party gets green light in Burundi|agency=Panapress|date=21 September 2004|url=http://www.panapress.com/Pro-monarchy-party-gets-green-light-in-Burundi--13-555192-17-lang2-index.html|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lavengro: The Scholar, the Gypsy, the Priest''''' (1851) is a work by [[George Borrow]], falling somewhere between the genres of memoir and novel, which has long been considered a classic of 19th-century English literature. According to the author ''lav-engro'' is a [[Romani language|Romany]] word meaning "word master".&lt;ref&gt;George Borrow ''Lavengro'' (London: John Murray, 1851) p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] called it "a book that breathes the spirit of that period of strong and eccentric characters".&lt;ref&gt;George M. Trevelyan ''British History in the Nineteenth Century and After (1782–1919)'' (London: Longmans, Green, 1941) p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its protagonist, whose name is George, is born the son of an officer in a militia regiment and is brought up in various barrack towns in England, Scotland and Ireland.  After serving an apprenticeship to a lawyer he moves to London and becomes a [[Grub Street]] hack, an occupation which gives him ample opportunities to observe London low-life. Finally he takes to the road as a tinker. At various points through the book he associates with Romany travellers, of whom he gives memorable and generally sympathetic pen-portraits.  ''Lavengro'' was followed by a sequel, ''[[The Romany Rye]]''. However, neither of the two books are self-contained. Rather, ''Lavengro'' ends abruptly with chapter 100, and carries on directly in ''The Romany Rye''. Thus both need to be read together, in order.

Borrow began work on ''Lavengro'' in 1842 and had written most of it by the end of 1843, but progress was then interrupted by a tour of eastern Europe and by bouts of ill-health, physical and mental.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Jenkins ''The Life of George Borrow'' (London: John Murray, 1912) p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;  He certainly intended the book to be an autobiography when he first set to work, and while writing it he more than once called it his Life in letters to his publisher, [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]]. In 1848 Murray advertised it as a forthcoming work to be called ''Lavengro, an Autobiography''.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Jenkins ''The Life of George Borrow'' (London: John Murray, 1912) pp. 366, 388&lt;/ref&gt;  However the version Borrow finally delivered had been reshaped into an autobiographical novel whose fictional episodes are inextricably intertwined with genuine memoir.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Starkie]], in his introduction to the Everyman edition, says, "We should approach ''Lavengro-Romany Rye'' as we do [[James Joyce]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''."&lt;/ref&gt; Only the "scholar" in the book's subtitle refers to Borrow.&lt;ref&gt;"Should you imagine that these three form one, permit me to assure you that you are very much mistaken." (Author's Preface to the First Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition had a print-run of only 3000 copies; it was such a slow seller that no reprint was needed until 1872.&lt;ref&gt;George A. Stephen ''Borrow House Museum: A Brief Account of the Life of George Borrow and his Norwich Home, with a Bibliography'' (Norwich: Norwich Public Libraries Committee, 1927) p. 18; Herbert Jenkins ''The Life of George Borrow'' (London: John Murray, 1912) p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor was it a critical success, reviewers being annoyed by the mix of fact and fiction and finding the treatment of Romany life insufficiently quaint.  ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' brought in a typical verdict:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We looked for some new revelations on the subjects of fortune-telling, hocus-pocus, and glamour.  Lavengro, with his three attributes like those of [[Vishnu]], might possibly be the Grand [[Cacique|Cazique]], the supreme prince of the nation of tinkers!

We have read the book, and we are disappointed. The performance bears no adequate relation to the promise…The adventures, though interesting in their way, neither bear the impress of the stamp of truth, nor are they so arranged as to make the work valuable, if we consider it in the light of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackwood's Magazine'' vol. 69, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After Borrow's death in 1881 ''Lavengro'' began to find a new audience and enthusiastic praise from critics. [[Theodore Watts-Dunton|Theodore Watts]], in an introduction to the 1893 edition, declared that "There are passages in ''Lavengro'' which are unsurpassed in the prose literature of England".&lt;ref&gt;George Borrow ''Lavengro'' (London: Ward, Lock, Bowden, 1893) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;  This edition started a run of reprints which produced one or more almost every year for 60 years.  ''Lavengro'' was included in the [[Oxford University Press]] [[Oxford World's Classics|World's Classics]] series in 1904, and in [[Everyman's Library]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://copac.ac.uk/search?au=borrow&amp;ti=lavengro&amp;sort-order=date Catalogue entry] at [[Copac]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Montefiore Club''' was a private social and business association, catering to the [[Jewish people|Jewish]] community, located in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.manilaclub.org/about/name-montefiore-club-country-canada.html Montefiore Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Montefoire Club in May 2015 - 02.JPG|thumbnail|left|Sign above door]]
Founded in 1880, the club was originally called the "Montefiore Social and Dramatic Club",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cazAAAAIAAJ|title=Mr. Sam: the life and times of Samuel Bronfman|last=Marrus|first=Michael Robert|date=1991-01-01|publisher=Penguin Books Canada|isbn=9780670834303|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; named for [[Moses Montefiore|Sir Moses Haim Montefiore]], the [[United Kingdom|British]]-Jewish [[philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From the ghetto to the Main : the story of the Jews of Montreal |last=King |first=Joe  |authorlink=Joe King (writer) |author2=Johanne Schumann |year=2001 |publisher=Montreal Jewish Publication Society |location= Montreal|isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by 11 people, all quite young, with ages ranging from 15 to 23,&lt;ref name=cjn&gt;[http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19666&amp;Itemid=86 The Canadian Jewish News - Montefiore Club closing doors after 130 years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a social club for young Jewish people. It held [[fundraising]] [[Ball (dance)|ball]]s to help Jewish [[refugee]]s, and [[Play (theatre)|play]]s that were produced to fund welfare programs for [[immigrant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=SHUCHAT, The Gate of Heaven: The Story of the Congregation Shaar Hashomayim of Montreal, 1846-1996 |last=Shuchat |first=Wilfred  |authorlink=Wilfred Shuchat|year=2002 |publisher= CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW, 83, Part 1 (2002): 9|location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later renamed the "Montefoire Club", and modelled on [[upper class]] [[gentlemen's club]]s of [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Samuel Bronfman : the life and times of Seagram's Mr. Sam |last=Marrus |first= Michael|authorlink=Michael Robert Marrus |year=1991 |publisher=  University Press of New England for Brandeis University Press|location= Hanover |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it functioned as a private social and business association,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Taking root: the origins of the Canadian Jewish community By Gerald J. J. Tulchinsky https://books.google.com/books?id=7tMCamkUKuQC&lt;/ref&gt; catering to members of the [[Jewish people|Jewish]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wertheimer.info/family/GRAMPS/Birnbaum/plc/6/0/b426d66270228490706.html Birnbaum-Grobstein family database - Places - Montefiore Club, Montreal, Quebec, Canada&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its members, were "well-to-do" members of the Jewish community, who were excluded from [[elite]] [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] clubs such as the St. James and the Mount Royal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canada's Jews : a people's journey |last=Tulchinsky |first=Gerald |authorlink=Gerald J J Tulchinsky |year= 2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto : Buffalo |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the club had more than 600 paying members.&lt;ref name=cjn /&gt;

In the mid-1990s, $500,000 was spent on renovations to the building.

In 2005, after experiencing a decline in membership, new policies were introduced:
*Annual fees were reduced
*Women were admitted as full members
*The [[dress code]] was relaxed
*New activities were introduced including luncheon speakers and wine workshops

In its final years, the building was used frequently by [[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]], usually for social events.

In the summer of 2010, after experiencing years of financial difficulties, the club closed.

==The club==
To obtain membership, a contribution to the life of Montreal's Jewish community was prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Father, son and CIA |last=Weinstein |first=Harvey |authorlink=Harvey Weinstein |year= 1990 |publisher=Goodread Biographies |location=Halifax, N.S. |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the Montefoire Club itself changed locations three times, the last being its 1195 [[Guy Street]] address, where it remained for 104 years, until its closure. The Guy Street location displayed no sign, with only a green canopy identifying it. The building is a large, three-storey [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] greystone.

The Guy Street location had a luxurious interior, with high ceilings, and a lobby built with large [[oak]] beams in a [[Architecture of the Netherlands|Dutch style]]. The rooms were carpeted, with deep-cusioned chairs and sofas, and walls of fine carved wood. Card rooms were located on the second floor, with bedrooms on the third floor that were made available on a temporary basis for members. Wives and children were forbidden access to the second and third floors.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wh-2gcQl6kC&amp;pg=PA174 Never Climbed His Mountain By Julian Gladstone&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was open seven days a week, and often rented out its facilities for community events. The cuisine was considered among the finest in the city, and although having a Jewish clientele, the club was never [[kosher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Maintaining consensus : the Canadian Jewish polity in the postwar world |last=Elazar |first=Daniel Judah |authorlink=Daniel Judah Elazar  |author2=Harold J Waller |year= 1990|publisher=University Press of America ; [Jerusalem] : Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |location=Lanham  |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable meetings==
Throughout its history, the club was as a venue for many notable meetings involving prominent members of the Jewish community.

*The establishment of the forerunner of the [[Federation CJA]].
*The planning of the [[Jewish General Hospital]].
*A meeting of Canadian Jewish leaders was convened by [[Samuel Bronfman]] and [[Sam Steinberg]] during the [[Six-Day War]]. In that single afternoon, $13 million was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Leo: A Life |last=Kolber |first=Leo |author2=MacDonald, L.

==Closure==
[[File:Montefoire Club in May 2015 - 01.JPG|thumbnail|Montefoir Club in 2015]]
In the summer of 2010, after operating for 130 years, and with only 72 paying members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewpi.com/montefiore-club-closing-doors-after-130-years/ Montefiore Club closing doors after 130 years | JewPI.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916034630/http://www.jewpi.com/montefiore-club-closing-doors-after-130-years/ |date=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the club closed. It had been experiencing financial difficulties, and had insufficient membership to remain open.

At the time of its closure, the club had used all of its financial reserves, and was operating at a deficit of approximately $25,000 per month. With an annual operating budget of about $750,000, and full fees being only about $2,000 (among the lowest for Montreal's private clubs), the club was unable to remain operation.&lt;ref name=cjn /&gt;

The organization sold the building to Concordia University. It will be renovated, and then used for meetings, events, and academic conferences.&lt;ref name=cca&gt;[http://now.concordia.ca/university-affairs/notices/20100913/concordia-purchases-montefiore-club.php Concordia purchases Montefiore Club - NOW - Concordia University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proceeds from the sale of the premises will be used to pay costs and staff severances. Remaining funds, expected to amount to approximately $1.5 million, will be donated to the [[Jewish Community Foundation of Montreal]] for Jewish education, and to Concordia University to fund a Jewish studies endowment.&lt;ref name=cca /&gt;

The contents of the building, which includes artwork, will be auctioned to members, with remaining items made available to the general public.

The club plans to donate its substantial archives to the [[Jewish Public Library of Montreal|Jewish Public Library]].&lt;ref name=cjn /&gt;

The '''Mungo''' ('''Moungo''') are an [[ethnic group]] of the [[Republic of Cameroon]]. Along with the other coastal peoples, they belong to the [[Sawa (ethnic group)|Sawa]] ethnic groups. The Mungo have historically been dominated by the [[Duala people]], and the two groups share similar cultures, histories, and  claims of origin.

==History and geography==
The Mungo share no singular origin story. Some claim the same history as the Duala and [[Limba people (Cameroon)|Limba]], descending from a man named [[Mbedi a Mbongo|Mbedi]]. From a place called Piti (northeast of [[Douala]]), Mbedi's sons [[Ewale a Mbedi|Ewale]] and [[Dibongo a Mbedi|Dibongo]] migrated south toward the Cameroon coast. while others trace their ancestry to a man named Lokula who migrated east from near [[Ibibio people|Efik]] territory in modern-day [[Nigeria]]. The former tradition seems more likely, however, and the Nigerian story possibly indicates that later settlers entered Limba country from Efik territories at some point and assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;Fanso 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, the Duala had become the leading traders in Cameroon. The Mungo provided goods and [[slave]]s to the Duala in exchange for goods obtained from the Europeans, such as alcohol, gunpowder, guns, mirrors, shoes, textiles, and tools.

In 1918, Germany lost [[World War I]], and her colonies became mandates of the [[League of Nations]]. Great Britain and France split the administration of the Kameruns, partitioning the Cameroonian Littoral. The Mungo were divided in two.

[[Image:Duala ethnic groups.png|thumb|left|325px|Map showing the location of the various Duala ethnic groups of Cameroon]]
The Mungo live along the [[Mungo River (Cameroon)|Mungo River]]'s lower stretch and the creeks that feed it. Their territory straddles the border of the [[Moungo division]] of the [[Littoral Province (Cameroon)|Littoral Province]] and the [[Fako division]] of the [[Southwest Province (Cameroon)|Southwest Province]]. Fishing is the primary means of subsistence.

===Language===
The Mungo who speak a dialect of [[Duala language|Duala]].&lt;ref&gt;"Duala", ''Ethnologue''.&lt;/ref&gt; Duala is part of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] group of the [[Niger–Congo language family]].

In addition, individuals who have attended school or lived in an urban centre usually speak a European language. For Littoral Mungo, this is [[French language|French]]; for Southwest Mungo, it is [[Cameroonian Pidgin English]] or standard [[English language|English]]; and for the Mungo it is one or the other. A growing number of the [[Anglophone Cameroonian|Anglophones]] today grow up with Pidgin as their first tongue.&lt;ref&gt;"Pidgin, Cameroon", ''Ethnologue''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
The Mungo are part of the lively musical heritage of the Cameroon Littoral. [[Ambasse bey]], a style of folk music marrying guitar with found-object percussion, developed in the 1950s in the Mungo area. [[Makossa]], a popular musical style in West and Central Africa, originated with the Duala around this same time. The style mixes [[jazz]], [[highlife]], and [[soul music|soul]] with [[music of Africa|African traditional music]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The Mungo are regular attendees of the annual [[Ngondo]], a traditional festival of the Sawa peoples. The goal is to communicate with the ancestors and ask them for guidance and protection for the future. The festivities also include armed combat, [[beauty pageant]]s, [[pirogue]] races, and traditional [[sport wrestling|wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;''Guide touristique'' 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Mungo are [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] in language and origin. More narrowly, they fall into the Sawa, or the coastal peoples of Cameroon.

[[File:Collectie Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen AM-670-7 Paquet Kongo Haiti Pierot Barra (Vervaardiging).jpg|thumb|A paquet congo created by [[Pierrot Barra]] ({{ill|National Museum of World Cultures|nl|Nationaal Museum van Wereldculturen}})]]
'''Paquet congo''' ({{lang-ht|Paket kongo}}) are [[Haiti]]an spiritual objects made by [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] priests and priestesses ([[houngan]]s and [[Mambo (Vodou)|mambo]]s) during  ceremonies. Their name comes from the ancient [[Kongo Kingdom]] in [[Africa]], where similar objects called [[nkisi|nikisi wambi]] are found. 

Kongolese [[nkisi]] use different materials from the Haitian paquet, however. A paquet is a collection of magical ingredients - herbs, earth, vegetable matter - wrapped in fabric and decorated with feathers, ribbons and sequins. 

Paquet congo are said to have the power of “heating” or activating the [[loa]]. Hence the term pwen cho (hot point) sometimes used to refer to them. Paquet serve as power objects and are kept on vodou altars and used in healing ceremonies.  They are also used as protective amulets in people’s homes, bringing health, wealth and happiness. 

Their efficacy supposedly depends on a technique of careful wrapping - seven or nine times – symbolic of an [[umbilical cord]] connecting the charm to the universe. Indeed, their appearance roughly resembles that of a human body (some have arms), and their colors and ornamentation are sometimes, but not always, symbolic of a specific loa.

'''Potdar''' was a hereditary office held by people belonging to the [[Deshastha Brahmin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Terrorism in Bengal: Terrorists outside Bengal deriving inspiration from and having links with Bengal terrorists|author=Amiya K. Samanta|publisher=Government of West Bengal|year=1995|page=967|quote= Potdar, Govind Narayan, Deshastha Brahmin, residence Bombay City.

''Potdar,'' derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Fotdar,'' literally means "purse bearar" or [[Treasurer]]. They were in charge of testing the genuineness weight of minted coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Journal of the administrative sciences|publisher=Patna University. Institute of Public Administration, Patna University |year=1979|volume=v. 24–25|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Kulkarni,Joshi, Gurav, Lohar, Kumbhar, Parit, Nhavi, Sutar, Chambhar, Mahar and Mang,who came from different castes, the ''Potdar'' formed a part of [[Bara Balutedar]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/39986188|title=Contemporary political leadership in India|last=|first=|date=1998|publisher=APH Pub.

The privilege of ''Potdari'' was granted by the [[Peshwa]] to a person who could advance a fixed sum of rupees to the government. The Potdar was to examine the coins used in of day-to-day transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23609308|title=Maratha administration in the 18th century|last=1945-|first=Mahajan, T.

Rural Servants in the 18th Century Maharashtrian Village—Demiurgic or Jajmani System?. Hitotsubashi journal of economics, 12(2), pp.14-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Potdar'' is a common Maharashtrian surname used by families whose ancestors held the office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">'''Public trial''' or '''open trial''' is a [[trial (law)|trial]] open to public, as opposed to the [[secret trial]]. The term should not be confused with [[show trial]].

==United States==
The [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] establishes the right of the accused to a public trial.

The right to a public trial is strictly enforced, but is not absolute. Trials may in exceptional cases be regulated. Closures are decided case-by-case by the judge evaluating a claimed danger to a substantial or legitimate public interest. But whatever the interest at stake, the likelihood of danger to that interest must meet a "‘substantial probability’ test".&lt;ref name=PressEnterpriseII&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0478_0001_ZO.html Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (1986)]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of cases presenting closure issues include [[organized crime]] cases (overall security concerns), [[rape]] cases (decency concerns), [[Minor (law)|juvenile]] cases,&lt;ref name=overview&gt;[http://faculty.ncwc.edu/mstevens/410/410lect24.htm Overview of the Sixth Amendment rights] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121210082619/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/mstevens/410/410lect24.htm |date=2012-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and through the [[Silent witness rule]] and/or [[Classified Information Procedures Act]], cases involving sensitive or '[[classified information|classified]]' information.&lt;ref&gt;See Ellis' decision in the US V Rosen case, who calls the Silent Witness Rule a 'partial closing' of the trial&lt;/ref&gt;

Trials may be closed at the behest of the government only if it can show "an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest".&lt;ref name=Waller&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0467_0039_ZO.html Waller v. Georgia (1984)]&lt;/ref&gt; The accused may also request a closure of the trial; in such a case, it must be demonstrated that "first, there is a substantial probability that the defendant's right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that closure would prevent, and second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant's fair trial rights".

But before a judge can close a courtroom, the judge must consider all potential alternatives to closure. This is a very strict standard; the Supreme Court has held that "trial courts are required to consider alternatives to closure even when they are not offered by the parties," or by anyone else.&lt;ref name=Presley&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-5270.ZPC.html Presley v. Georgia (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a judge who does not want to be reversed on appeal must be confident that there cannot possibly be any alternative to closure that might later be conjured up by some appellate lawyer.

==Canada==
Pursuant to the [[open court principle]] and related legislation, legal proceedings are generally open to the public and the media.

Section 135(1) of the ''Courts of Justice Act'' (Ontario) states the general principle that "all court hearings shall be open to the public". In Quebec, however, under the Quebec Act 1774 the French legal system (including non-public trials) was allowed to remain intact and there is no requirement in Quebec that trials be public.

==Soviet Union==
In [[Soviet Union]] the terms "open trial" (открытый процесс) and "public trial" (публичный процесс) differed. The term "open trial" implied the possibility for public to be present at the hearings. The term "public trial" implied the purposeful presentation of the process to wide public. Public trials were usually widely discussed in media and hearings were often arranged in larger [[auditoria]]. While the Soviet public trials are commonly associated with [[Stalin era]] [[show trials]], such as [[Moscow Trials]], nevertheless in [[Russian culture]] the term "public trial" did not acquire negative connotations, despite the apparent attributes of a show, primarily because the publicity of any information in pre-[[glasnost]] era was severely limited by the Soviet state. The term "show trial" corresponds to Russian "показной процесс" (''pokaznoy process'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20508">[[File:Pulvermacher chain.jpg|thumb|250px|'''Fig. 1.''' Pulvermacher's chain. The handles pointing away from the holder are insulated so that the physician can safely place the device in contact with any part of the patient's body.]]

The '''Pulvermacher chain''', or in full as it was sold the '''Pulvermacher hydro-electric chain''', was a type of [[voltaic cell|voltaic battery]] sold in the second half of the 19th century for medical applications.  Its chief market was amongst the numerous [[Quackery|quack]] practitioners who were taking advantage of the popularity of the relatively new treatment of [[electrotherapy]], or "electrification" as it was then known.  Its unique selling point was its construction of numerous linked [[galvanic cell|cells]], rendering it mechanically flexible.  A variant intended to be worn wrapped on part of the body for long periods was known as '''Pulvermacher's galvanic chain''' or '''electric belt'''.

The Pulvermacher Company attracted a great deal of antagonism from the medical community due to their use of the names of well-known physicians in their advertising without permission.  The nature of their business; in selling to charlatans and promoting quack practices also made them unpopular with the medical community.  Despite this, the Pulvermacher chain was widely reported as a useful source of electricity for medical and scientific purposes, even amongst the most vocal critics of the Pulvermacher Company.

==Construction==
[[File:Pulvermacher chain link.png|thumb|'''Fig. 2.''' Cells of the chain showing details of the method of linking them together.]]
[[File:Pulvermacher chain - detail of links.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 3.''' Details of chain links from Pulvermacher's patent. Pulvermacher's figure 1 is a chain battery made of more conventional cells with flat plates.  Figure 2 is Pulvermacher's chain joined end-to-end with the grooved dowels shown to the left.  Figures 3 and 4 show respectively a link and a chain with the cells joined side-by-side.  Figure 6 is Pulvermacher's interrupter link.]]

Electrically, the machine worked like a [[voltaic pile]], but was constructed completely differently.  The electrodes were copper for the [[cathode]] and zinc for the [[anode]], with the [[electrolyte]] consisting of [[vinegar]] or some other weak acid, or a salt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Lardner, p.288&lt;br /&gt;Pulvermacher, pp.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Each cell consisted of a wooden [[dowel]] with a [[bifilar coil|bifilar winding]] of copper and zinc wires.  The dowels were helically grooved like a screw thread to locate the wires precisely in position.  This enabled the copper and zinc wires to be placed very close to each other without coming into electrical contact.  Insulated wires could not be used as this would interfere with the operation of the electrolyte.  Copper wires were inserted into the ends of the dowels to which the copper and zinc windings were soldered.  These end wires were either attached to, or formed into, hooks and eyes for attaching to other cells.  This arrangement is depicted in figure 2.  These attachments provided the electrical connections as well as the mechanical linkages.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, p.370&lt;br /&gt;Lardner, pp.288-289&lt;br /&gt;Moritz, p.97&lt;br /&gt;Pulvermacher, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Each cell was connected to the next with the copper winding of one being connected to the zinc winding of the next and so on.  The cells could be connected end-to-end, or for a more compact assembly side-by-side, in the manner of links in a chain.  The [[voltage]] delivered by the assembly was controlled by the number of links thus incorporated and could become quite high, even though the current available was no more than from a single cell (to increase the current, the size of the cells must be increased).  The shock delivered by such chains was described as "strong" for one chain of 120 links, and as "sharp" for another of 50 links.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, p.370&lt;br /&gt;Lardner, p.289&lt;br /&gt;Moritz, pp.97-98&lt;br /&gt;Pulvermacher, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to use, the chain was soaked in vinegar so that the electrolyte was absorbed into the wooden dowels.  The wood of which the dowels were made was chosen to be a very porous type so that the amount of electrolyte absorbed was maximised.  The chain would continue to produce a voltage until the dowels dried out, then the chain would have to be resoaked.  Typically, the chain would be charged by slowly drawing it through a bowl of vinegar as shown in figure 4.&lt;ref&gt;Coley, p.370&lt;br /&gt;Lardner, p.289&lt;br /&gt;Moritz, pp.97-98&lt;br /&gt;Powell, p.21&lt;br /&gt;Pulvermacher, pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

A special link could be included in the chain which incorporated an [[interrupter]] circuit.  The purpose of the interrupter is to rapidly connect and disconnect the circuit so that the normally steady current of the battery is turned into a rapidly varying current.  The usual practice in the use of medical electrical batteries was to feed the output of the interrupter to an [[induction coil]] in order to increase the voltage applied to the patient by [[transformer]] action.  In Pulvermacher's patent however, there is no mention of using induction coils - the Pulvermacher battery could produce large voltages merely by adding more links to the chain.  However, the interrupter still had an effect in that an interrupted current produces a stronger sensation of electric shock in the patient than a steady current.&lt;ref&gt;Hemat, p.216&lt;/ref&gt;  A novel feature of Pulvermacher's interrupter was that it was operated by the action of a vibrating spring kept in motion by the movements of the patient without the need for any external input.  Interrupters of the time typically had to be hand-cranked by the physician, although there were already some in existence using electro-mechanical automatic interrupters.&lt;ref&gt;Golding Bird, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Zp0iSrtvmMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Observations on induced electric currents, with a description of a magnetic contact-breaker"], ''Philosophical Magazine'', pp.18-22, no.71, '''vol.12''', January 1838.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later versions of the Pulvermacher chain used clockwork driven interrupters whose rate of interruption could be adjusted so that the rate of shock to the patient could be controlled.  Such a clockwork interrupter is fitted to the chain shown in figure 1.  It is wound up by turning the handle at the left end.&lt;ref&gt;Lardner, p.289&lt;br /&gt;Pulvermacher, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1869 a variant of this chain had appeared.  In this the wooden dowels were dispensed with, and instead a hollow tube of zinc or [[magnesium]] was used.  The zinc tube itself formed the anode of the cell, and over this was wound the copper wire cathode, or in yet another version, rings of copper plates.  The zinc tube and copper wire were kept apart by stitches of thread.  Magnesium was not commonly used by battery manufacturers of the time due to its very high price (unlike today) compared to zinc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MqIoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA470#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Magnesium"], ''The American Annual Cyclopedia'', '''vol.7''' (1867), p.470, New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1868.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a cell made with magnesium in place of zinc produces around twice the voltage.  More importantly for Pulvermacher, the cell would still output some voltage if the electrolyte was replaced with plain water.  Pulvermacher marketed a type of chain that was designed to be worn wrapped around a limb being treated and was claimed to operate with body sweat acting as the electrolyte and no need to charge it with electrolyte from an external source.  Pulvermacher also produced a smaller "pocket version" of the chain which had fewer links than the full 120-cell version.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, pp.20-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MT3-7-69/&gt;

==Pulvermacher==
Isaac Lewis Pulvermacher was a physicist and inventor originally concerned with the electric telegraph.  He first published details of his chain in August 1850 in German and in the winter of that same year came to Britain to demonstrate the machine to notable physicians.  He visited [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]] on this trip.  He gives his residence as [[Breslau]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in his 1853 US patent.&lt;ref&gt;de la Peña, p.264&lt;br /&gt;Pulvermacher, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this, however, he had arrived in Britain from [[Vienna]] and all the British sources of the time describe him as "of Vienna".&lt;ref&gt;Coley, p.369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical opinion==
[[File:Pulvermacher's chain - vinegar.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 4.''' Charging the chain by slowly drawing through vinegar.]]
At first, there was a very positive reaction to Pulvermacher.  Early in 1851 Pulvermacher gave [[Golding Bird]], a well known London physician with an interest in electrotherapy, a sample of the machine with which to experiment.  Bird was impressed enough with it that he later gave a representative of the Pulvermacher Company a testimonial as a letter of introduction to physicians in Edinburgh.  Bird thought that the battery would make a useful source of portable electricity and could be used for treating patients with some forms of paralysis in their homes.  Contemporary equipment was not very portable, and in the case of friction machines required skilled operators to keep going.  By October 1851 Bird felt that he had tested the device sufficiently to give it a glowing article in ''[[The Lancet]]''.  But even at this early stage there were signs of disquiet.  Even as he wrote the favourable report in ''The Lancet'' Bird felt the need to level criticism at the Pulvermacher Company's London agent, one C. Meinig, for promoting the device as a "universal panacea" for almost any imaginable complaint in the company's advertisements.  Bird was a tireless opponent of quack practitioners, and was particular quick to criticise medically unqualified electrical treatment, as he felt this was a reason professional acceptance of his own work in electrotherapy was being held back.  The quack practitioner market was the very sector that the Pulvermacher Company's unrestrained claims were aimed at. Nevertheless, Bird was gracious enough to specifically exclude Pulvermacher himself from responsibility for these "injudiciously puffed" claims.&lt;ref name="Coley, p.370"&gt;Coley, p.370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golding Bird, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LzhPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA388#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Remarks on the hydro-electric chain of Dr. Pulvermacher"], ''The Lancet'', pp.388-389, '''vol.2''', 1851.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pulvermacher belt.jpg|thumb|left|1886 advertisement in the ''Irish Journal of Medical Science'']]
By April 1853 the situation had become very acrimonuous.  Meinig had been using extracts from the testimonial provided by Bird without permission in order to bolster the Company's, medically largely unsupported, quack advertising claims. Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity.  A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the ''Association Medical Journal''.  Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those that were supposed to produce instant results (a typical course of electrotherapy at the time could last several months).  He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering "too feeble" a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte&lt;ref&gt;Pulvermacher, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;).  This resulted in the ''Journal'' removing the Pulvermacher advertisements from its pages.  The ''Association Medical Journal'' was quickly followed by the ''Medical Times'' and with growing pressure on ''The Lancet'' to do the same this pretty much ended professional medical support for the device, at least for the time being.&lt;ref name="Coley, p.370"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BMJ15-4-53&gt;John McIntyre, Golding Bird, C. Meinig, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dRVAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA316#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Dr. Golding Bird and Pulvermacher's electric chain"], ''Association Medical Journal'', '''vol.1''' (new series), no.15, pp.316-317, 15 April 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dRVAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA518#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Four strongholds of quackery in the fourth estate"], ''Association Medical Journal'', '''vol.1''' (new series), no.24, pp.518-520, 17 June 1853.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this inauspicious start with the medical profession, the Pulvermacher chain continued to be described in scientific and medical journals and books as a useful tool throughout the late 1850s and 1860s, even being mentioned in the proceedings of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe, Charles Bland [https://books.google.com/books?id=9ukAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA349#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "An inquiry into the muscular movements of resulting from the action of a galvanic current upon a nerve"], ''Proceedings of the Royal Society'' '''vol.10''', no.39, pp.347-359, 1 March 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Bird, at the height of his dispute with the Pulvermacher company found himself able to say "the ''battery'' of Pulvermacher is an ingenious and useful source of electricity..."&lt;ref name=BMJ15-4-53/&gt;  Although banned from much of the medical press, the Pulvermacher Company did not restrain its advertising claims or its use of notable names.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oXYRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA592#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true Example Pulvermacher advertisement] ''Christian Witness and Congregational Magazine'', '''vol.16''' (1859), p.16, London: John Snow 1859.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[College of Dentists]] investigated its possible use as an anaesthetic during tooth extraction but found no benefit with the device frequently adding to the pain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tNYCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA223#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Report of committee on electricity as an anæsthetic during dental operations"], ''Transactions of the College of Dentists of England: 1859'', pp.223-240.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1869, the Pulvermacher Company again found itself the subject of discussion in the medical press when they were involved in legal proceedings.  This time the company was itself the victim of quacks when its product was pirated with poor quality imitations and this was the cause of the court case.  The ''Medical Times'' was prompted by this to examine the efficacy of the Pulvermacher chain ending a long period of the paper ignoring it as a worthless quack instrument.  The result was a very positive review of the chain's function and the reviewer particularly praised the workmanship.&lt;ref name=MT3-7-69&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bp0EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Pulvermacher's galvanic chain and the advertising quacks"], ''The Medical Times and Gazette'', '''vol.2''', pp.21-22, 3 July 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition and decline==
[[File:Boston Electric Belt. Wellcome L0003568.jpg|thumb|Boston Electric Belt, a competitor]]
Pulvermacher patented the chain battery in the US in 1853.  This was soon followed by the wearable chain battery belt, or electric belt.  Electric belts became enormously popular in the US, far more so than in Europe.  This led to the company headquarters being moved to Cincinnati by the 1880s as the Pulvermacher Galvanic Company, but still calling themselves Pulvermacher's of London for the prestige of a European connection.  Early models had to be soaked in vinegar before use as in England, but later on models that worked purely by galvanic action with body sweat were introduced.  Since the device was being sold essentially as a quack cure it was only necessary to generate enough electricity that the wearer could feel it, no matter how slightly, and know that it was working.&lt;ref&gt;de la Peña, pp.110, 118, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric belts were made for every conceivable part of the human anatomy: limbs, abdomen, chest, neck – sometimes all worn at the same time.  Pulvermacher even had a model designed to attach to the male genitals in a special sac which was claimed to cure impotence and [[erectile dysfunction]].  Pulvermacher promoted a theory that loss of "male vigour" in later life was a consequence of masturbation in early life and that a limited supply of semen, which provided the vigour, would run out before time if wasted.  Pulvermacher's device was meant to address this shortcoming.&lt;ref&gt;de la Peña, pp.138-140, 150-153&lt;br /&gt;Schlesinger, pp.164-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition was very intense for this lucrative market and the claimed benefits became ever more extravagant.  Amongst Pulvermacher's many competitors in the US were the German Electric Belt Company (actually New York based), Dr Crystal's, Dr. Horn's, Addison's, Edson's, Edison's, Owen's and Heidelberg's.  Edison's was founded by Thomas Edison Junior, whose father was the famous [[Thomas Edison]].  Owen's was originally New York based but expanded across the country until they were put out of business due to fraud.  In Europe too, there were competitors.  The Medical Battery Company of England made a popular belt.  They attempted (unsuccessfully) to sue the  ''Electrical Review'' when that paper accused them of quackery in 1892.  The [[Iona Company]], an Oregon-based company founded by [[Henry Gaylord Wilshire]] was still selling belts in 1926 and making large profits: $36,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|36000|1926|r=-3}}}} inflation adjusted) net from 2,445 belts in five months.  By the end of the 1920s the electric belt's popularity had severely declined (but not the public's appetite for other quack electric cures) and the scientific market had long since moved on to better electrical generation technology than chain batteries.&lt;ref&gt;de la Peña, pp.110-111, 121&lt;br /&gt;Schlesinger, pp.164-165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The Pulvermacher chain, especially in the form of one being worn on the body, was very familiar in the late 19th and early 20th century and would not have needed to be explained to an audience.  For instance, there are references to it in the novel ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' when the character Homais wearing a number of Pulvermacher chains is described as "more bandaged than a Scythian".&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p.165&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Romani people}}
The '''Romanichals''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|r|ɒ|m|ə|n|ɪ|tʃ|æ|l}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|n|i|-}}),&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; also '''Romnichals''', '''Rumnichals''' or '''Rumneys''', are a [[Romani people|Romani]] sub-group in the [[United Kingdom]] and other parts of the English-speaking world. 

Romanichals are thought to have arrived in [[Kingdom of England|England]] in the 16th century. They are closely related to the [[Kale (Welsh Romanies)|Welsh Kale]] and to other Romani groups in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[continental Europe]].

==Etymology==
The word "Romanichal" is derived from ''Romani chal'', where ''chal'' is [[Angloromani language|Angloromani]] for "fellow".&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Second Edition 1989, "Romany&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, n. and a."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Borrow|first=George Henry|title=Romano Lavo-Lil|year=2007|publisher=BiblioBazaar|isbn=978-1434679260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Romanichal are found across the [[United Kingdom]], particularly [[England]], [[Lowland Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. The Romanichal diaspora emigrated from the British Isles to other parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Based on some estimates, there are now more people of Romanichal descent in the [[United States]] than in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/people-clusters.php?rop2=C0088 Joshua Project, 2010, ''Gypsy, English, Romanichal of South Africa''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rme Ethnologue, 2009, ''Angloromani''].&lt;/ref&gt; They are also found in smaller numbers in [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]].
There also exists a small community in Malta who have colonial Romanichal ancestry.

==Language==
{{main|Angloromani language}}
The Romani people in England are thought to have spoken the [[Romani language]] until the 19th century, when it was replaced by English and Angloromani, a [[creole language]] that combines the [[syntax]] and [[grammar]] of English with the Romani lexicon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Romanichals also speak English.

Many Angloromani words have been incorporated into English, particularly in the form of [[British slang|British slang.]]&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|History of the Romani people}}
[[File:Movimiento gitano.jpg|thumb|300px|The migration of the Romanies through the [[Middle East]] and [[Northern Africa]] to Europe.]]
The Romani people have origins in [[India]], specifically [[Rajasthan]]&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=6rTEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA259&amp;dq=gypsies+india+rajasthan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiPlMLVsbHaAhUd24MKHS3tBWEQ6AEILDAB&lt;/ref&gt; and began migrating westwards from the 11th century. The first groups of Romani people arrived in [[Great Britain]] by the end of the 15th century, escaping conflicts in [[Southeastern Europe]] (such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Balkans]]).

In 1506 there are recorded Romani persons in [[Scotland]],&lt;ref name="English Gypsies 1875"&gt;B. C. Smart et al. (1875) ''The Dialect of the English Gypsies'', Asher &amp; Co., London&lt;/ref&gt; arrived from [[Spain]] and to [[England]] in 1512.&lt;ref name="English Gypsies 1875"/&gt; Soon the leadership passed laws aimed at stopping the Romani immigration and at the assimilation of those already present.

During the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], the [[Egyptians Act 1530|Egyptians Act (1530)]] banned Romanies from entering the country and required those living in the country to leave within 16 days. Failure to do so could result in confiscation of property, imprisonment and deportation. During the reign of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] the act was amended with the [[Egyptians Act 1530#Egyptians Act 1554|Egyptians Act (1554)]], which removed the threat of punishment to Romanies if they abandoned their "naughty, idle and ungodly life and company" and adopted a settled lifestyle, but it increased the penalty for noncompliance to death.

In 1562 a new law offered Romanies born in England and Wales the possibility of becoming English subjects if they assimilated into the local population. Despite persecution and this new option, the Romani were forced into a marginal lifestyle and subjected to continuous discrimination from the state authorities and many non-Romanies. In 1596, 106 men and women were condemned to death at [[York]] just for being Romani, and nine were executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sh4FDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;dq=1596+106+romani+executed+in+uk&amp;hl=xx-bork&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzjcXMjqjeAhUnHDQIHfcNC9sQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1596%20106%20romani%20executed%20in%20uk&amp;f=false|title='The Damned Fraternitie': Constructing Gypsy Identity in Early Modern England, 1500–1700|last=Timbers|first=Frances|date=2016-04-20|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317036517|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Rid]] authored two early works about them in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

From the 1780s, gradually, the anti-Romani laws were repealed, although not all. The identity of the Romanichals was formed between the years 1660 and 1800, as a Romani group living in Britain.

[[File:RumneyDavey.jpg|thumb|A British Romanichal]]
England began to deport Romanichals as early as 1544, principally to [[Norway]],&lt;ref&gt;Walter Otto Weyrauch (2001) ''Gypsy Law: Romani Legal Traditions and Culture'', University of California Press {{ISBN|0520221869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, Gösta (1964) ''Slang och hemliga språk'', Published by Prisma, Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt; a process that was continued and encouraged by [[Elizabeth I]] and [[James I of England|James I]].&lt;ref name="MacRitchie, David 1894"&gt;MacRitchie, David (1894) ''Scottish Gypsies under the Stuarts'', Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish Kale]], a Romani group in Finland, maintain that their ancestors had originally been a Romani group who travelled from [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rmf Ethnologue website]&lt;/ref&gt; thereby supporting the idea that they and the Scandinavian Travellers/Romani are distantly related to present-day Scottish Romani and English Romanichals.&lt;ref&gt;Angus M. Fraser (1995) ''The Gypsies (The Peoples of Europe)'', p. 120, Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford, UK {{ISBN|0631196056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eltzler. ''Zigenarna och deras avkomlingar i Sverige'' (Uppsala 1944) cited in: Angus M. Fraser. ''The Gypsies (The Peoples of Europe)'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603 an [[Order in Council]] was made for the transportation of Romanichal to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the [[West Indies]], [[France]],  [[Spain]] and the [[Low Countries]]. Other European countries forced the further transport of the Romani of Britain to the Americas. Many times those deported in this manner did not survive as an [[ethnic group]], because of the separations after the round up, the sea passage and the subsequent settlement as slaves, all destroying their social fabric. At the same time, voluntary emigration began to the [[English overseas possessions]]. Romani groups which survived continued the expression of the Romani culture there.

In the years following the [[American War of Independence]], Australia was the preferred destination for Romanichal transportation, due to its use as a penal colony. The exact number of British Romani deported to Australia is unknown. It has been suggested that three Romanichal were present on the [[First Fleet]],&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; one of whom was thought to be [[James Squire]]&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; who founded Australia's first commercial brewery in 1798, and whose grandson [[James Farnell]] who became the first native-born Premier of [[New South Wales]] in 1877. The total Romani population seems to be an extremely low number when we consider that British Romani people made up just 0.01% of the original 162,000 convict population.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; However, it has been suggested that Romanichal were one of the main target groups and were discriminated against due to the transportation laws of England in the mid-18th century.&lt;ref name="Donohoe 1988"&gt;Donohoe, J.H. (1988) ''The Forgotten Australians: Non-Anglo or Celtic Convicts and Exiles''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often difficult to distinguish British Romani people of Wales and England from the majority of non-Romani convicts at the time, therefore the precise number of British Romanies transported is not known, although there are occurrences of Romani names and possible families within the convict population; however it is unclear if such people were members of the established Romani community.&lt;ref name="Donohoe 1988"/&gt; Fragmentary records do exist and it is thought with confidence at least fifty or more British Romanies may have been transported to Australia, although the actual figure could be higher.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt; What is clear is that such deportation (as for all convicts) was particularly harsh:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"For Romani convicts transportation meant social and psychological death; exiled they had little hope of returning to England to re-establish family ties, cultural roots, continuous expression and validation that would have revived their Romani identity in the convict era."&lt;ref name=identity&gt;Thomas Acton and Gary Mundy (1997) ''Romani Culture and Gypsy Identity'', University Of Hertfordshire Press {{ISBN|0900458763}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One, however, is known to have returned. Henry Lavello (or Lovell) was repatriated with a full pardon with a son born to an Aboriginal woman who accompanied him back to England.&lt;ref name=identity/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donohoe 1988"/&gt;

Racism against Romanichal and other travelling peoples is still endemic within Britain.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/no-blacks-no-dogsno-gypsies-860873.html| location=London | work=The Independent | first=Rachel | last=Shields | date=6 July 2008 | title=No blacks, no dogs, no Gypsies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the media reported that Romani experience a higher degree of racism than any other group in the UK, including asylum-seekers, and a Mori poll indicated that a third of UK residents admitted to being prejudiced against Romani.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

===Slavery===
{{main|Slavery in Britain and Ireland}}
In the 17th century [[Oliver Cromwell]] shipped Romanichals as [[slaves]] to the American southern plantations&lt;ref name="The Pariah Syndrome 1987"&gt;Ian F. Hancock (1987) ''The Pariah Syndrome: An Account of Gypsy Slavery and Persecution'', Karoma Publishers, Ann Arbor, Michigan {{ISBN|0897200799}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is documentation of English Romanies being owned by freed black slaves in [[Jamaica]], [[Barbados]], [[Cuba]], and [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name="MacRitchie, David 1894"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Pariah Syndrome 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1865) ''Domestic Annals of Scotland from the Reformation to the Revolution'',  Vol.II, W &amp; R Chambers, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt; Gypsies, according to the legal definition, were anyone identifying themselves to be Egyptians or Gypsies.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Abbot E. (1971) ''Colonists in bondage'', W. W. Norton Co., New York {{ISBN|0393005925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beier, A. L. (1985) ''Masterless Men: the Vagrancy Problem in England, 1560–1640'', Methuen, London and New York {{ISBN|0416390102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[George Borrow]] reflect the influences this had on the Romani Language of England and others contain references to Romanies being ''bitcheno pawdel'' or ''Bitchade pardel'', to be "sent across" to America or Australia, a period of Romani history not forgotten by Romanies in Britain today. One term reflects this in the contemporary Angloromani for "magistrate" is ''bitcherin' mush'', the "transporter."

==Culture==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Historically, Romanichals earned a living doing agricultural work and would move to the edges of towns for the winter months. There was casual work available on farms throughout the spring, summer and autumn months; spring would start with seed sowing, planting potatoes and fruit trees, early summer with weeding, and there would be a succession of harvests of crops from summer to late autumn. Of particular significance was the [[Hops|hop]] industry, which employed thousands of Romanichals both in spring for [[vine training]] and for the harvest in early autumn. Winter months were often spent doing casual labour in towns or selling goods or services door to door.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;http://weareallrelated.info/Mike's%20Maternal%20Ancestors/b10890.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass industrialisation of agriculture in the 1960s led to the disappearance of many of the casual farm jobs Romanichals had traditionally carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/romany_roots/history/index.shtml
|title = Romany History
|author = BBC Kent Romany Roots
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century onwards Romanichals became, and remain, the mainstay of travelling funfairs, scrap metal dealing, horse dealing, tree surgery, tarmacking, asphalt paving, hawking, fortune telling and wooden rose making. They have also produced notable boxers such as [[Henry Wharton (boxer)|Henry Wharton]] and [[Billy Joe Saunders]] as well as some notable footballers like [[Freddy Eastwood]], and journalists, psychotherapists, nurses and all manner of professions.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=c6HFPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=romanichal+careers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR2JensrHaAhXn8YMKHaMiBW0Q6AEIKjAB&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel==
[[File:Romanichal wagon.JPG|thumb|Romanichal style Reading Vardo late 19th century.]]
{{main|Vardo (Romani wagon)}}
Originally, Romanichals would travel on foot, or with light, horse-drawn carts, and typical of other Romani groups would build [[Bender tent]]s where they settled for a time. A Bender is a type of tent constructed from a frame of bent hazel branches (hazel is chosen for its straightness and flexibility), covered with canvas or tarpaulin. These tents are still favoured by [[New Age Travellers|New Traveller]] groups.

Around the mid- to late 19th century, Romanichals started using wagons that incorporated living spaces on the inside. These they called ''Vardos'' and were often brightly and colorfully decorated on the inside and outside. In the present day, Romanichals are more likely to live in [[Travel trailer|caravans]] or houses.

Over 60% of 21st-century Romanichal families live in houses of bricks and mortar whilst the remaining 40% still live in various forms of traditional Traveller modes of transport, such as caravans, trailers or static caravans (a small minority still live in [[Vardo (Romani wagon)|Vardo]]s).

According to the Regional Spatial Strategy caravan count for 2008, there were 13,386 caravans owned by Romani in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region of England, whilst a further 16,000 lived in bricks and mortar. Of the 13,386 caravans, 1,300 were parked on unauthorised sites (that is, on land where Romani were not given permission to park). 
Over 90% of Britain's travelling Romanichals live on authorised sites where they pay full rates ([[council tax]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Second Edition 1989, "Romany&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, n. and a."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtraveller.org.uk/images/providing_traveller_sites.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118212743/http://www.irishtraveller.org.uk/images/providing_traveller_sites.pdf |archivedate=18 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On most traveller Romanichal sites there are usually no toilets or showers inside caravans because in Romanichal culture this is considered unclean, or 'mochadi'. Most sites have separate utility blocks with toilets, sinks and electric showers. Many Romanichals will not do their laundry inside, especially not underwear, and subsequently many utility blocks also have washing machines. In the days of horse-drawn wagons and Vardos, Romanichal women would do their laundry in a river, being careful to wash upper body garments further upstream from underwear and lower body garments, and personal bathing would take place much further downstream. In some modern trailers, a double wall separates the living areas from the toilet and shower.&lt;ref&gt;Thoma Acton and David Gallant (2008) ''Romanichal Gypsies (people under threat)'', Hodder Wayland, London {{ISBN|0750255781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the (British) [[Caravan Sites Act 1968]] which greatly reduced the number of caravans allowed to be pitched on authorised sites, many Romanichals cannot find legal places on sites with the rest of their families.

Like most nomadic groups, Romanichals travel around for work, usually following set routes and set stopping places (called ‘atching tans’) which have been established for hundreds of years. May traditional stopping places were established before land ownership changed and any land laws were in place. Many atching tans were established by feudal land owners in the Middle Ages, when Romani would provide agricultural or manual labour services in return for lodgings and food.

Today, most Romani travel within the same areas that were established generations ago. Most people can trace their presence in an area back over a hundred or two hundred years. Many traditional stopping places were taken over by local government or by settled individuals decades ago and have subsequently changed hands numerous times; however Romani have long historical connections to such places and do not always willingly give them up. 
Most families are identifiable by their traditional wintering base, where they will stop travelling for the winter, and this place will be technically where a family is ‘from’.

The [[Enclosure Act]] of 1857 created the offence of injury or damage to village greens and interruption to its use or enjoyment as a place of exercise and recreation. The [[Commons Act]] 1876 makes encroachment or inclosure of a village green, and interference with or occupation of the soil unlawful unless it is with the aim of improving enjoyment of the green.

The [[Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960]] states that no occupier of land shall cause or permit the land to be used as a caravan site unless he is the holder of a site licence. It also enables a district council to make an order prohibiting the stationing of caravans on common land, or a town or village green. These acts had the overall effect of preventing travellers using the vast majority of their traditional stopping places, much to the relief of local residents.

The Caravan Sites Act 1968 required local authorities to provide caravan sites for travellers if there was a demonstrated need. This was resisted by many councils who would claim that there were no Romanies living in their areas.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=TeO9LL2k6TUC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=The+Caravan+Sites+Act+1968+provided+caravans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbp47C3-7bAhWY-2EKHbJoDYoQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Caravan%20Sites%20Act%201968%20provided%20caravans&amp;f=true&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that insufficient pitches were provided for travellers, leading to a situation whereby holders of a pitch could no longer travel, for fear of losing it.

The [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] removed the duty of local councils to provide authorised pitches and gave the Council and Police powers to move travellers on, subject to certain welfare issues. The official response of the government was that travellers should buy land and apply for [[planning permission]] to occupy it. However, those that did so found it extremely difficult to get planning permission, with more than 90% of applications by travellers refused.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In the first phase of the [[Second World War]], the [[Nazis]] drew up lists of Romani individuals (many of them Romanichals) and persons with Romani ancestry from the United Kingdom to be interned and subjected to [[Porajmos]] in the event of the country's occupation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The crisis of the 1960s decade, caused by the [[Caravan Sites Act 1968]] (stopping new private sites being built until 1972), led to the appearance of the "British Gypsy Council" to fight for the rights of the Romanichals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reocities.com/Paris/5121/timeline.htm The Patrin Web Journal - Timeline of Romani (Gypsy) History&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the issue of "travellers" (referring to [[Irish Travellers]] and [[New Age Travellers]] as well as Romanichal and other groups of Romani people) became a 2005 [[general election]] issue, with the leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] promising to review the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. This law, which absorbs the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] into UK [[primary legislation]], is seen by some to permit the granting of retrospective planning permission. Severe population pressures and the paucity of [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] sites have led to ''travellers'' purchasing land and setting up residential settlements very quickly, thus subverting the planning restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=5AawQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=romanichal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6gP7WubHaAhVK5oMKHawkDMMQ6AEIJDAA&lt;/ref&gt;

Romanichal including other ethnic groups of travellers, Irish Travellers and New Age Travellers, argued in response that thousands of retrospective planning permissions are granted in Britain in cases involving non-Romani applicants each year and that statistics showed that 90% of planning applications by Romanies and travellers were initially refused by [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local councils]], compared with a national average of 20% for other applicants, disproving claims of preferential treatment favouring Romanies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cre.gov.uk/gdpract/g_and_t_facts.html|title=Gypsies and Irish Travellers: The facts|publisher=Commission on Racial Equality (UK)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011112335/http://cre.gov.uk/gdpract/g_and_t_facts.html|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argued that the root of the problem was that many traditional stopping-places had been barricaded off and that the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] passed by the previous Conservative government had effectively criminalized their community, for example by removing local authorities’ responsibility to provide sites, thus leaving the travellers with no option but to purchase unregistered new sites themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series8/week_three.shtml|work=Inside Out - South East|date=19 September 2005|title=Gypsies|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sango''' (also spelled '''Sangho''') is a [[creole language]] in the [[Central African Republic]] and the primary language spoken in the country. It is an [[official language]] of the Central African Republic, making the Central African Republic one of the few African countries with an indigenous language as an official language. It is used as a [[lingua franca]] across the country and had 450,000 native speakers in 1988. It also has 1.6 million [[second language]] speakers.

The creole is based on the [[Northern Ngbandi language]]. It was used as a [[trade language]] along the [[Ubangi River]] prior to [[Ubangi-Shari|French colonisation]] in the 1880s. In colloquial speech 90% of the language's vocabulary is Sango, whereas in more technical speech French loanwords constitute the majority.

== Classification ==
Some linguists, following William J. Samarin, classify it as a [[Ngbandi language|Ngbandi]]-based creole; however, others (like Marcel Diki-Kidiri, Charles H. Morrill) reject that classification and say that changes in Sango structures (both internally and externally) can be explained quite well without a creolization process.

According to the creolization hypothesis, Sango is exceptional in that it is an African- rather than European-based creole.&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt; Although [[French language|French]] has contributed numerous loanwords, Sango's structure is wholly African.&lt;ref name="walker" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Sango tribe.png|thumb|Sango tribe members, 1906]]
A variety of Sango was used as a [[lingua franca]] along the [[Ubangi River]] before French colonization, in the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="karan12.1"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.1 Sango: language of wider communication and of the churches}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French army recruited Central Africans, causing them to increasingly use Sango as a means of interethnic communication.&lt;ref name="karan12.1" /&gt; Throughout the 20th century, missionaries promoted Sango because of its wide usage.&lt;ref name="karan12.1" /&gt;

Originally used by river traders, Sango arose as a lingua franca based on the [[Northern Ngbandi language|Northern Ngbandi]] dialect of the Sango tribe, part of the [[Ngbandi languages|Ngbandi language cluster]], with some [[French language|French]] influence.

The rapid growth of the city of [[Bangui]] since the 1960s has had significant implications for the development of Sango, with the creation, for the first time, of a population of first-language speakers. Whereas rural immigrants to the city spoke many different languages and used Sango only as a lingua franca, their children use Sango as their main (and sometimes only) language. That has led to a rapid expansion of the lexicon, including both formal and slang terms. Also, its new position as the everyday language of the capital city has led to Sango gaining greater status and being used increasingly in fields for which it was previously the norm to use French.

== Geographic distribution ==
Sango is widespread in the Central African Republic, with 350,000 speakers at the 1970 census. It is also spoken as a lingua franca in southern Chad, where it is probably not spoken natively and its use is decreasing, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where its use is increasing.

Today, Sango is both a national and official language of the Central African Republic, which makes the Central African Republic one of the few African countries to have an indigenous language as an official language.

== Registers ==
A study by Taber (1964) indicates that some 490 native Sango words account for about 90% of colloquial speech; however, while French loanwords are much more rarely used, they account for the majority of the vocabulary, particularly in the speech of learned people. The situation might be compared to English, in which most of the vocabulary, particularly "learned" words, is derived from [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], or French while the basic vocabulary remains strongly [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]. However, more recent studies suggest that the result is specific to a particular sociolect, the so-called "functionary" variety. Morrill's work, completed in 1997, revealed that there were three sociologically distinct norms emerging in the Sango language: an urban "radio" variety which is ranked by 80% of his interviewees and has very few French loan words; a so-called "pastor" variety, which is scored 60%; and a "functionary" variety, spoken by learned people, who make the highest use of French loanwords while speaking Sango, which scores 40%.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
Sango has seven oral and five nasal vowels.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt; Vowel quality and number of nasalized vowels may be affected by the mother tongue of non-native speakers of Sango.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt;

Palatal affricates occur in loan words and certain dialects.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt; Some dialects have alternations between [ᶬv] and [m], [ᵐb] and [ᵑ͡ᵐg͡b], [ᵐb] and [b], word-medial [l] and [r], and word-initial [h] and [ʔ].&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt; [ᶬv] is quite rare.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt;

=== Syllable structure ===
Syllable structure is generally CV.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt; Consecutive vowels are rare but do occur.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt; Consonants may be palatalized or labialized, orthographically C{{angle bracket|i}} and C{{angle bracket|u}}, respectively.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt;

Words are generally monosyllabic or bisyllabic but less commonly are trisyllabic.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt; Four-syllable words are created via [[reduplication]] and compounding, and may also be written as two words (''kêtêkêtê'' or ''kêtê kêtê'' 'tiny bit', ''walikundû'' or ''wa likundû'' 'sorcerer').&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt;

=== Tone ===
Sango has three basic tones (high, mid, and low), with contour tones also occurring, generally in French loanwords.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt; Tones have a low [[functional load]], but [[minimal pair]]s exist: ''dü'' 'give birth' versus ''dû'' 'hole'.

Monosyllabic loan words from French usually have the tone pattern high-low falling (''bâan'' 'bench' from French ''banc''). In multisyllabic words all syllables carry low tone except the final syllable, which is lengthened and takes a descending tone. The final tone is generally mid-low falling for nouns ('ananäa' ''pineapple'' from French ''ananas'') and high-low falling for verbs ('aretêe' 'to stop' from French ''arrêter'').

In isolation, tones have [[ideolect]]al variation, and they may also be affected by the mother language of non-native speakers.&lt;ref name="karan_phonology" /&gt;

== Grammar ==
Sango is an [[isolating language]] with [[subject–verb–object]] word order, as in English.&lt;ref name="karan12.4"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.4 Sango grammatical structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noun phrases are of the form determiner-adjective-noun:&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''mbênï''||''kêtê''||''môlengê''
|-
| ||indef.||small||child
|}
: "a small child"

Plurals are marked with the [[proclitic]] ''â-'', which precedes noun phrases:&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''âmbênï''||''kêtê''||''môlengê''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-indef.||small||child
|}
: "some small children"
''â-'' may be attached to multiple items in the noun phrase by some speakers, but this is less common:&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''âkötä''||''(â)zo''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-big||person
|}
: "important people/dignitaries"

The derivational suffix ''-ngö'' [[nominalize]]s verbs. It also changes all tones in the verb to mid:&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''kono''|| to grow, be big || ''kîri'' || to return, repeat
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''könöngö''|| size || ''kïrïngö'' || return
|}

Genitives are normally formed with the preposition ''tî'' 'of':&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''dû''||''tî''||''ngû''
|-
| ||hole||of||water
|}
: "water hole, well"
However, compounding is becoming increasingly common: ''dûngü'' 'well' (note the change in tone).&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt; Such compounds are sometimes written as two separate words.&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;

The verbal prefix ''a-'' is used when the subject is a noun or noun phrase but not when the subject is either a pronoun or implicit (as in imperatives):&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''âmôlengê''||''tî''||''lo''||''agä''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;-child||of||&lt;small&gt;3S&lt;/small&gt;||&lt;small&gt;SM&lt;/small&gt;-come
|}
:"his children came"
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''adü''||''lo''
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;SM&lt;/small&gt;-give.birth||&lt;small&gt;3S&lt;/small&gt;
|}
:"he was born" (lit. "someone bore him")
{| border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="border-collapse:collapse"
|-
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||''löndö''||''mo''||''gä''
|-
| ||rise||&lt;small&gt;3S&lt;/small&gt;||come
|}
:"get up and come (here)"
The prefix is sometimes written as a separate word.&lt;ref name="karan12.4" /&gt;

The [[pronoun]]s are ''mbï'' "I", ''mo'' "you (singular)", ''lo'' "he, she, it", ''ë'' "we", ''ï'' "you (plural)", ''âla'' "you (plural)", ''âla'' "they".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikibooks:Sango/Pronouns]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Verbs take a prefix ''a-'' if not preceded by a pronoun: ''mo yeke'' "you are" but ''Bêafrîka ayeke'' "Central Africa is". Particularly useful verbs include ''yeke'' "be", ''bara'' "greet" (&gt; ''bara o'' "hi!"), ''hînga'' "know".  Possessives and appositives are formed with the word ''tî'' "of": ''ködörö tî mbï'' "my country", ''yângâ tî sängö'' "Sango language". Another common preposition is ''na'', covering a variety of [[locative]], [[dative]], and [[instrumental case|instrumental]] functions.

== Orthography ==
Sango began being written by French missionaries, with Catholic and Protestant conventions differing slightly.&lt;ref name="karan_orthog_pre"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.9 The Sango orthography before 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1966 Bible and 1968 hymnal were highly influential and still used today.&lt;ref name="karan_orthog_pre" /&gt;

In 1984, President [[André Kolingba]] signed 'Décret No 84.025', establishing an official [[orthography]] for Sango.&lt;ref name="karan_orthog_post"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.9 The 1984 orthography decree}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Sango alphabet consists of 22 letters:

Letters are pronounced as their IPA equivalent except for {{angle bracket|y}}, pronounced as [j]. Also, the digraphs {{angle bracket|kp, gb, mb, mv, nd, ng, ngb, nz}} are pronounced {{IPA|[k͡p]}}, {{IPA|[ɡ͡b]}}, {{IPA|[ᵐb]}}, {{IPA|[(ᶬv)]}}, {{IPA|[ⁿd]}}, {{IPA|[ᵑɡ]}}, {{IPA|[ᵑ͡ᵐɡ͡b]}} and {{IPA|[ⁿz]}}, respectively.

{{angle bracket|’b}}, {{angle bracket|ty}}, and {{angle bracket|dy}} may be used in loan words not fully integrated into Sango's phonological system.&lt;ref name="karan_orthog_post" /&gt;

The official orthography  contains the following [[consonant]]s: {{angle bracket|p, b, t, d, k, g, kp, gb, mb, mv, nd, ng, ngb, nz, f, v, s, z, h, l, r, y, w}}: some add {{angle bracket|’b}} for the [[implosive]] {{IPA|/ɓ/}}. Sango has seven oral [[vowel]]s, {{IPA|/a e ɛ i o ɔ u/}}, of which five, {{IPA|/ĩ ã ɛ̃ ɔ̃ ũ/}}, occur [[nasal vowel|nasalized]]. In the official orthography, {{angle bracket|e}} stands for both {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, and {{angle bracket|o}} stands for both {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}; nasal vowels are written {{angle bracket|in, en, an, on, un}}.

Sango has three [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]: low, mid, and high. In standard orthography, low tone is unmarked, {{angle bracket|e}}, mid tone is marked with [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]], {{angle bracket|ë}}, and high tone with [[circumflex]], {{angle bracket|ê}}: ''do-re-mi'' would be written {{angle bracket|do-rë-mî}}.

Sango has little written material apart from religious literature, but some basic literacy material has been developed.&lt;ref name="karan12.7"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Karan|2006|loc=12.7 Sango literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Learning ==
Sango is considered unusually easy to learn; according to Samarin, "with application a student ought to be able to speak the language in about three months." However, reaching true fluency takes much longer, as with any other language.

For English-speakers there are two main difficulties. One must remember not to split double consonants: [[Bambari]], for example, must be pronounced ba-mba-ri, not bam-ba-ri. Also, as with any other tonal language, one must learn not to vary the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] according to the context.  For example, if one pronounces a question with a rising tone as in English, one may inadvertently be saying an entirely different and inappropriate Sango word at the end of the sentence.

The '''Tavern Club''' is a [[gentlemen's club|private social club]] in the [[Central (Cleveland)|Central]] neighborhood of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[United States|USA]]. Its home is a  building designed by architect [[J. Milton Dyer]] in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Northern Renaissance style]].  It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; It was also designated as a landmark by the City of Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planning.city.cleveland.oh.us/landmark/listDetail.php?identity=233 |title=Cleveland Designated Landmarks: Property Detail |publisher=Cleveland Landmarks Commission |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyer was a member of the Tavern Club, which was established 1892-93.  He designed a building for the group when it moved from a leased property at 968 Prospect Street to its present building on January 1, 1905. "The exterior construction and the traditional interior decor of the building" have remained essentially the same since the club's beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.cwru.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=TC |title=Tavern Club |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |date=1997-07-22 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upstairs originally contained two squash courts and a [[Rackets (sport)|rackets]] court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10051">'''Teledildonics''' (also known as '''cyberdildonics''') is technology for remote sex (or, at least, remote [[mutual masturbation]]), where tactile sensations are communicated over a data link between the participants.  The term can also refer to the integration of [[telepresence]] with [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] that these interfaces make possible &amp;mdash; the term was [[neologism|coined]] in 1975 by [[Ted Nelson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae: Theodor Holm Nelson|url=http://hyperland.com/TNvita|last=Nelson|first=Ted|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''[[Computer Lib / Dream Machines]]''.

The term has also been used less accurately (since there's no "tele-" element) to refer to robotic sex, i.e. computer-controlled [[sex toy]]s that aim to substitute for or improve upon sex with a human partner.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Joel [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997256,00.html "Will cybersex be better than real sex?"] Time magazine, June 19, 2000.

Sex toys that can be manipulated remotely by another party may be of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Regina [https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/sexdrive/2004/09/65064 "Ins and outs of teledildonics."] Wired, September 24, 2004. Retrieved July 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These toys sometimes come with movies to which the toys' actions are synchronized by means of a previously-written script. Other products being released fit a new category called bluedildonics, which allow a sex toy to be controlled remotely via a [[Bluetooth]] connection. A report in 2008 suggested that teledildonics, along with text and email and webcams, can be used to "wind each other up to fever pitch during the working day" as a prelude to sex with a human during the evening hours.&lt;ref name=twsH36&gt;{{cite news

A book reviewer of [[David Levy (chess player)|David Levy]]'s ''Love and Sex with Robots'' in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2008 suggested that teledildonics was "but one stage in a technological and social revolution" in which robots will play an  increasingly important role, with artificial lifeforms that will "attend to our needs with magic fingers"; Levy argued that by 2050 "sex with robots will be commonplace."&lt;ref name=twsH35&gt;{{cite news

Promoters of these devices have claimed since the 1980s they are the "next big thing" in [[cybersex]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Anna Jane [http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/08/29/teledildonics/index.html "Single, white with dildo."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606233335/http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/08/29/teledildonics/index.html |date=2011-06-06 }} Salon, July 23, 2008. Retrieved July 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A report in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' in 1993 suggested that teledildonics was "the virtual-reality technology that may one day allow people wearing special bodysuits, headgear and gloves to engage in tactile sexual relations from separate, remote locations via computers connected to phone lines."&lt;ref name=twsH37&gt;{{cite news |author= David Rothschild |title= High-tech Sex |publisher= ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' |date= September 28, 1993 |url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-09-28/features/9309280044_1_cd-rom-interactive-computer-software-virtual-valerie |accessdate= 2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses to teledildonics has been mixed, however the dominant concern has centred on the separation of personal intimacy and embodied presence. In the words of one early text on the subject:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 1992 | last1= Carkeek | first1= Freya | last2= James | first2= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= This Abstract Body: The Self, the Body and Identity | url= https://www.academia.edu/33643614/This_Abstract_Body_The_Self_the_Body_and_Identity_1992_ | journal= Arena | issue=  99–100 | pages= 66–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{cquote| Indeed, pushing at the cultural-technical limits of the integrity-fragmentation contradiction can, in the short term, supercharge the disembodied body with ‘sensual’, transgressive ambiguity. For example, ‘teledildonics’, computer-simulated; sexual arousal by wearing plugged-in bodysuits, may never become widely practised, but it certainly provokes interest as a ''risque'' possibility ... [T]echno-sex contributes to hollowing out the corporeal taken-for-grantedness of which, paradoxically, it depends. }}

At the 2016 [[South by Southwest Festival]] virtual reality entrepreneur [[Ela Darling]] asserted that patent holders were [[Patent troll|preventing]] the production of teledildonic technology.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian2016-03-18/&gt;
Many companies experimenting in the field have been hit with patent lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="950">A '''''teuctocaitl''''', ([[Nahuatl]] for "lordly name"; {{IPA-nah|teːkʷtoːˈkaːitɬ|pron}}), was a special [[title]] usually ending in the word ''teuctli'' ("lord"). It was borne by [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] [[tlatoani|tlatoani (rulers)]] in pre-Columbian central [[Mexico]]. 

Each position of rulership had its own title associated with it, although a ''teuctocaitl'' could be borne by multiple rulers.

[[Tlatoani]] is the Nahuatl term for the ruler of an [[altepetl]], a pre-Hispanic state.

{{Expand German|topic=culture|date=January 2016|Willkommens- und Anerkennungskultur}}
The German concept of '''welcoming culture''' (in German: '''''Willkommenskultur''''') designates firstly a positive attitude of politicians, businesses, educational institutions, sports clubs, persons and institutions towards foreigners, including and often especially towards migrants. Second, the term expresses the wish that all foreigners and migrant people  encountered by these institutions may be accepted and particularly not be exposed to discrimination. Third, the word ''welcoming culture'' means all the measures promoted by a positive attitude towards foreigners and migrants in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/47/muslims-islam-west-terrorism/seite-6 |title=Muslims: The Willkommenskultur is a chance for reconciliation &amp;#124; ZEIT ONLINE |website=Zeit.de |date=2015-11-24 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/willkommenskultur-in-germany-non-merci-in-france/a-18721427 |title=′Willkommenskultur′ in Germany, ′non merci′ in France &amp;#124; Germany &amp;#124; DW.COM &amp;#124; 17.09.2015 |website=DW.COM |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill |first=Jenny |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29686248 |title=Germany struggles to adapt to immigrant influx |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationsportal.de/glossar/willkommenskultur |title=Glossarartikel: Willkommenskultur &amp;#124; IQ Netzwerk Niedersachsen |language=de |website=Migrationsportal.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091107/http://www.migrationsportal.de/glossar/willkommenskultur |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wirtschaftsfoerderung-sbh.de/mcms.php?_oid=3d87e3a-c60c-b10d-545f-5b50787c7ef95&amp;_template=view |title=Gewinnung und Bindung von Neubürgern in der Region Schwarzwald-Baar-Heuberg |website=Wirtschaftsfoerderung-sbh.de |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German equivalent ''Willkommenskultur'' was elected in Austria in December 2015 as "Word of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.at/20151203/willkommenskultur-is-austrian-word-of-the-year |title='Willkommenskultur' is Austrian word of the year - The Local |website=Thelocal.at |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign perspectives==
The English daily ''[[The Guardian]]'' distinguishes two meanings of the term '''welcoming culture''':

Originally it was meant to attract people from abroad to Germany to compensate for a huge shortage of skilled workers, particularly in sparsely populated areas.
Since the beginning of the [[European migrant crisis|European refugee crisis in 2015]], the term was being used to promote assistance for millions of refugees coming to Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Doris Akrap |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/sep/06/germany-refugee-crisis-syrian |title=Germany’s response to the refugee crisis is admirable. But I fear it cannot last &amp;#124; Doris Akrap &amp;#124; Opinion |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were received by highly visible posters "refugees welcome", and by actual help of any kind, mainly on private initiative of uncountable German citizens.

[[File:Welcome differentlangs.svg|thumb|Translation of the word "welcome" are found at many places, which are visited by [[tourist]]s.]]
The French daily ''[[Libération]]'' adds that the word "welcome culture" was originally created decades ago in the [[tourism]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.liberation.fr/planete/2015/12/30/willkommenskultur_1423633 |title=Willkommenskultur - Libération |website=Liberation.fr |date=2015-12-30 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view "welcome culture" would also be a Germanisation of the technical term ''Hospitality Management''.

''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that Chancellor Angela Merkel was also laying the foundation for new "hyphenated German" groups, namely "the Syrian-Germans, Iraqi-Germans, Afghan-Germans", alluding to the phenomenon of [[hyphenated American]] identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/world/europe/as-germany-takes-in-refugees-it-also-rehabilitates-its-image.html?_r=1|title=As Germany Takes in Refugees It Also Rehabilitates Its Image|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
