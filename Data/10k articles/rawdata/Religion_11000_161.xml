      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">'''Abraham Rovigo''' (born ca. 1650 in [[Modena]], died 1713 in [[Mantua]]) was a Jewish scholar, rabbi and [[kabbalist]]. He studied in [[Venice]] in the ''[[yeshiva]]'' of [[Moses Zacuto]] and devoted himself to study the [[Kabbalah]]. He was one of the main supporters of the moderate wings of [[Sabbatai Zevi]] and gathered around him many followers of the movement, like [[Behr Perlhefter]], [[Mordechai Mokiach]] and [[Mordechai Ashkenazi]]. In 1700–1701 he spent one year in [[Fürth]], in order to proofread and manage the publishing of the manuscripts of the Zoharic commentary of his pupil Mordecai Ashkenazi. One year later, he and a group of followers settled in the Holy Land.

Rovigo came from a wealthy Modena family, and was dedicated throughout his entire life to studying, collecting, and publishing Kabbalistic manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom. "Rovigo, Abraham ben Michael." Encyclopaedia Judaica. Ed. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. 2nd ed. Vol. 17. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. 500-501. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 21 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a close friend of Benjamin ben Eliezer Ha-Kohen Vitale of Reggio with whom he had studied Kabbalah in Venice under Moses Zacuto. Scholem also mentions in several places the correspondence about Sabbatean affairs he maintained with [[Meir bar Hiyya Rofe]] between the years 1674 and 1678 as a very important source for the history of the Sabbatean movement.&lt;ref&gt;Scholem, Gershom, ''Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah: 1626–1676'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1973, p. 771. This correspondence was published by Isaiah Tishby in ''Sefunoth'', III-IV (1960), pp. 71-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13426">'''Mírzá Aḥmad Sohráb''' (March 21, 1890 – April 20, 1958) was a [[Persian people|Persian]]-[[United States|American]] author and [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] who served as [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]]'s secretary and interpreter from 1912 to 1919.  He co-founded the New History Society and the [[Caravan of East and West]] in [[New York City|New York]] and was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Bahá'í Faith in 1939 by [[Shoghi Effendi]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born a [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] in [[Isfahan Province|Sedeh, Isfahan Province, Persia]] (now [[Iran]]), Sohrab's father `Abdu'l-Baghi was a descendent of [[Muhammad]].  `Abdu'l-Baghi was the chief dyer of the town.  Both sides of Sohrab's family, his mother and his father, claimed descent from the Imam Husayn, grandson of Muhammad.  His mother died when Sohrab was a few months old, while she herself was still a teenager, and he was taken to live with his maternal grandmother in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]].

===New History Society===
[[File:Belmont Lofts.JPG|thumb|Former residence of Ahmad Sohrab in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
By 1911, he had founded an organization called the [[Persian-American Educational Society]].  Later that year he sailed to Europe "in the interests of his work".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 13, 1911, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Sohrab was secretary and interpreter to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] from 1912 to 1919.  He emigrated to the United States in 1919, sailing as a first class passenger from Port Said, Egypt to New York, on board the S/S ''Yeboshi Maru''. In the 1920's, while living in [[Los Angeles]], he helped write a scenario for a movie dealing with [[Mary Magdalene]], for the actress [[Valeska Surratt]].  In 1927 [[Cecil B. Demille]] released [[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]] which the duo claimed he had stolen from their scenario.  Suratt sued [[Cecil B. Demille]] and others in 1928, and mentioned that Sohrab had helped her write the play.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', February 28, 1928, p2&lt;/ref&gt;  The case went to trial in 1930 and was quietly settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tribstar.com/history/local_story_073225216.html{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He found it necessary to go to New York to discuss business matters with Miss Surratt and it was through her that he was introduced to [[Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler]] and his wife [[Julie Chanler|Julie]].  Together they formed the "New History Society" in 1929 as an indirect way of spreading the teachings of the Bahá'í Faith.

On Mar 10, 1930, "Mirza Ahmad Sohrab" filed a petition for naturalization in the US District Court of New York City.  The petition states that he is 39 years old and residing at 28 W 50th Street.

===Caravan of East and West===
The New History Society gave rise in 1930 to the [[Caravan of East and West]], and the Chanler's New York house was now called ''Caravan House''.  This foundation was designed to prepare children and youth to join the New History Society. This group had a quarterly magazine called ''The Caravan'', where Sohrab's partial autobiography first appeared.  (The autobiography appeared again in 1959, shortly after his death, with a few additional paragraphs which add little.)

:"The Caravan of East and West is an educational movement, the chief activity of which is international correspondence. It numbers 1,300 Chapters in 37 countries, with an aggregate membership of 100,000 children, young people and adults. Its publications, The Caravan and Pen Friends Guide, respectively appearing quarterly and monthly, keep the large circle of its readers informed as to the growth and influence of the movement.  The New History Society and the Caravan is a movement in itself for the spreading of the Bahá'í ideals and principles, independent of and unaffiliated with the Bahá'í organization."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/sohrab_ferm Bahai Library "Ferm"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sohrab had already published a few books, pamphlets and a movie scenario, when in 1933, with Julie Chanler he wrote a book that provided an overview of many of the events of the Bahá'í movement; it contained a description of the events of the [[Báb]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]] &amp;mdash; his claim in the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]]&amp;mdash; [[Táhirih]], and `Abdu'l-Bahá.  The book also contains several pictures, including some which may be unique.

===The Split===
Mrs. Chanler attempted to patch things up between Sohrab and [[Horace Holley (1887-1960)|Horace Holley]], "one of the chief men in the American Bahá'í Administration".&lt;ref&gt;[http://freebahais.com/white.htm Free Bahais "White"]&lt;/ref&gt; But Sohrab refused to allow the New York [[Spiritual Assembly]], to have oversight of the affairs of the New History Society.  Since Holley sat on the National Spiritual Assembly at this time, this led to a confrontation which resulted in Sohrab and the Chanlers being expelled from the Bahá'í community about 1939.

Sohrab's wife and daughter remained faithful to Shoghi Effendi and changed their names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm Bahai Studies "Shoghi"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515041702/http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/shoghi.htm |date=May 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit===
In 1941, Allen McDaniel and others, as members of the National Spiritual Assembly, filed suit against Sohrab to try to stop him from using the name Bahá'í.  The NSA felt this created the impression that Sohrab was "connected with and authorized to represent the Bahá'í religion..."

This suit was filed in the Supreme Court of New York County.  The judge granted a motion to dismiss, stating that "the plaintiffs have no right to a monopoly of the name of a religion.  The defendants, who purport to be members of the same religion, have an equal right to use the name of the religion..."

The judge mentioned that the complaint could be further amended &lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/sohrab_vs_us-nsa_1941 Bahai Library "Sohrab Vs NSA"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the NSA appealed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/P-T/S/sohrab/BS247.gif H-Net "Sohrab BS247"]&lt;/ref&gt; but the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the lower court.

===Collaboration with other opponents of Shoghi Effendi===

After his excommunication, Sohrab joined forces with other people who opposed [[Shoghi Effendi]]. Part of this combination was a court case raised by Qamar Bahá'í, Jalal the grandson of [[Mírzá Músá]] and others in about 1950-1, challenging Shoghi Effendi's right to carry out major construction work around the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of their key witnesses, Nayyir Afnan, died shortly before the case was due to open, and it all came to nothing. One of the culminations of this was a meeting that was held in [[Famagusta]] in the late 1950s. Representatives of all three main generations of what Baha'is call "[[Covenant-breaker]]s" were present including: Jalal Azal representing the followers of [[Subh-i-Azal|Mirza Yahya]], `Ismat and others represented the followers of [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí]], and Ahmad Sohrab represented those opposed to any form of administration. One of the aims of this conference was to build a mausoleum over the grave of Mírzá Yahyá. To this end, an amount of money was collected but it "disappeared" and nothing came of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_cyprus_exiles Bahai Library "Exiles"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moojan Momen]] notes that:
:"In theory, the second generation, who accepted Bahá'u'lláh, should have had nothing to do with the first generation followers of Azal, the enemy of Bahá'u'lláh. Similarly, the third generation, accounting themselves loyal followers of `Abdu'l-Bahá, should have had nothing to do with the second generation who were vehement opponents of `Abdu'l-Bahá; even less should they support the first generation. But in fact strong links formed between these generations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant Bahai Library "Momen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final years===
Caravan eventually severed the links with the Bahá'í Faith, but Sohrab, Mrs. Chanler, and their organizations continued claim association with the Bahá'í Faith as long as they both were living.

The Caravan existed for a time as a worldwide pen-pal club with social ideals.  In addition, there are various references to the Caravan Art Gallery at this same address.  There are also references in Mrs. Chanler's and Sohrab's writings to art showings.

Sohrab died April 20, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', April 22, 1958; p. 33 "Obituary"&lt;/ref&gt; In his obituary he is described as "leader of the Reform Bahá'í Movement in the United States and co-director of the [[Caravan of East and West]]".

The New History Society is now defunct, not outliving Sohrab, however the Caravan of East and West persisted and currently operates at the same address as Caravan Institute, an adult-education Italian language school with no connection to the Bahá'í Faith.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1681">'''Azones''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ˌ|z|oʊ|n|z}} ({{lang-el|Άζωνοι}}) in [[mythology]], was a term anciently applied to [[god]]s and [[goddess]]es that were not the private divinities of any particular country or people.

The Chapel of St Apolline, La Grande Rue, [[Saint Saviour, Guernsey]] is a protected building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digimap.protected.gov.gg/ |title=Environment : Protected Trees, Buildings &amp; Monuments Webmap}}&lt;/ref&gt; and historic monument. Constructed in the 14th century, it is still in regular use for worship. The Chapel has stood virtually unchanged for over 600 years.

==History==

Nicholas Henry, who lived in nearby La Perelle manor constructed the [[chantry]] chapel in 1392 and dedicated it to Saint Apolline.&lt;ref name="CofE"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.achurchnearyou.com/guernsey-chapel-of-st-apolline/ |title=Chapel of St Apolline, Guernsey |publisher=Church of England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria]], Apolline was a woman in Alexandria around A.D. 249 where Christians were being persecuted. After having her jaw and all her teeth destroyed, when she threw herself into a fire, becoming a martyr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museums.gov.gg/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=76706&amp;p=0 |title=St Apolline’s Chapel |publisher=Guernsey Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canonised in A.D. 300, she became the patron saint of dentists. A fourteenth century Dominican prayer appeals to her against the pain of toothache.&lt;ref name=Waco/&gt;{{rp|23}}

The first mention of a chapel  was on the 20th July, 1394 when [[Richard II of England]] issued a charter mentioning “la chapelle de Saint Marie de la Perelle”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stsavioursgg.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/stos-junejulysmall1.pdf |title=The chapel of Saint Apolline |publisher=ST Saviour Parish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time the name was used, ‘la chapelle de Notre Dame de la Perrelle, appelleye la chapelle Sainte Appolyne’ is in a title document dated 1452

The chapel changed hands a number of times until with the old Catholic order being replaced during the [[Protestant Reformation]], a Royal Commissions, set up on 25 May 1563, conveyed Ste Apolline’s Chapel to Thomas Effart, who was a leading Protestant and Jurat. The building then fell into ruin, saved from demolition by its use as a stable.&lt;ref name=Waco/&gt;{{rp|25}}

A number of objects were probably hidden or taken at this time, some of which have since been recovered including a 14th-century stone figurine, 16th century cross, a silver burette for holding wine or water, two candlesticks and a bell clapper.&lt;ref name=Waco/&gt;{{rp|26}}
[[File:The Channel Islands 1862 Ansted Latham 31.jpg|thumb|left|1862 drawing by Ansted &amp; Latham]]

The chapel appears on the 1787 Duke of Richmond’s map of Guernsey by William Gardner on a plot of three [[Vergée]] (around 1.2 acres) planted with an apple orchard.

The States of Guernsey bought the building and 12 perches of land (about 0.12 acre) in 1873 for £120 when it was being used as a cattle barn. It was the first such acquisition to preserve important buildings in Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/guernsey/ste_apollines/index.html |title=Ste Apolline’s Chapel, Guernsey |publisher=Wessex Archaeology online |date=28 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapel was restored in the 1970s. Under floor heating were added to try to solve the damp together with a replaced [[bellcote]], new roof and lighting.

The damp problem was not solved, with both roof leaks and rising damp affecting the building and paintings. In 2003 proposals were made to improve the preservation of the chapel and in particular the paintings. These further improvements, including improving ventilation have since reduced the problem.&lt;ref name=Waco/&gt;

==Chapel==
[[File:Guernsey 2012 102, St. Apolline, Last Supper.jpg|thumb|400px|St. Apolline, 14th-century painting of the Last Supper]]

With 8.2m x 4.2m interior dimensions, there is seating for 14 inside the Chapel which comprises a single room with a pointed vaulted roof.

The interior of the chapel shows evidence of the original 14th-century paintings, one on the south wall depicting the last supper.&lt;ref name=CofE/&gt; another is possibly of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles. The paintings would have been created in haste, needing to complete them as the plaster dried.&lt;ref name=Waco/&gt;{{rp|20}}

The 0.75m thick walls of the chapel indicate various sources for the stone, mainly from nearby Cobo, on the west coast, there is also local Perelle stone and stone from Icart on the south of Guernsey. Stones from the more distant [[Chausey]] islands have been identified and two blocks of Caen stone, from Normandy, are used in the north window.&lt;ref name="Waco"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/system/files/ConsPlan_53511_03_screen.pdf |title= Ste Apolline’s Chapel St Saviour’s Parish Guernsey |publisher=Wessex Archaeology |date=18 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

The Chapel is open every day to the public and is used as a place of prayer for Christian Unity. A simple place for contemplation and reflection.

==Protection==
The building the boundary walls and enclosed area were listed as a '''Protected Monument''' on 16 March 1938, reference PM204&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://planningexplorer.gov.gg/portal/servlets/LBSearchServlet?PKID=6304 |title=PM204 |publisher=States Of Guernsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyrus the Great]] (c. 600 or 576 – 530 BC) figures in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as the patron and deliverer of the [[Jew]]s. He is mentioned 23 times by name and alluded to several times more.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bible, Cyrus the Great, king of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], was the monarch under whom the [[Babylonian captivity]] ended. In the first year of his reign he was prompted by God to decree that the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] should be rebuilt and that such Jews as cared to might return to their land for this purpose. Moreover, he showed his interest in the project by sending back with them the sacred vessels which had been taken from the [[First Temple]] and a considerable sum of money with which to buy building materials. The existence of the decree has been challenged.

==Cyrus in Babylon and the Jewish connection==
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn (Dutch - Daniel and Cyrus before the Idol Bel - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|Painting of [[Cyrus the Great]] with [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]]]
Cyrus the Great is unconditionally praised in the Jewish sources. It is likely that, after the [[Nabonidus#The Persian conquest of Babylonia|Persian conquest of Babylon]], Cyrus had commenced his relationship with the Jewish leaders in exile,&lt;ref name=Briant&gt;Briant, P., ''From Cyrus to Alexander: a History of the Persian Empire'', (Trans. version), Indiana (2002), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he later was considered as anointed by God.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Isaiah|45:1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hebrew Bible states that Cyrus issued the decree of liberation to the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|1:1-2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyrus's edict]] for the rebuilding of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people. According to Ezra 4:1-6 "the enemies of Judah and Benjamin" asked to help build the temple, and when this was denied hired counselors to frustrate the people of Judah from completing the rebuilding throughout the reign of [[Cyrus]], [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] ('Ahasuerus'), and [[Artaxerxes I|Artaxerxes]], until the reign of [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]]. The work recommenced under the exhortations of the prophets, and when the authorities asked the Jews what right they had to build a temple, they referred to the decree of Cyrus. [[Darius II]], who was then reigning, caused a search for this alleged decree to be made, and it was found in the archives at [[Ecbatana]],&lt;ref&gt;''Achmetha'', {{bibleverse||Ezra|6:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Darius reaffirmed the decree and the work proceeded to its triumphant close.

A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus gives the history of the reign of [[Nabonidus]] ('Nabuna'id'), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the [[Babylonian empire]]. {{citation  needed|date=March 2017}} In 538 BC, there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at [[Opis]], and immediately afterwards [[Sippara]] opened its gates to the conqueror. [[Gobryas]] (Ugbaru), the governor of [[Medes|Media]], was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered "without fighting," and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to "all the province of Babylon," of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, [[Nabonidus]], who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, [[Cambyses II]], the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of "king of Babylon," claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple.

Speculation abounds as to the reasoning for Cyrus' release of the Jews from Babylon. One argument being that Cyrus was a follower of [[Zoroaster]], the [[monotheistic]] prophet: [[Zoroastrianism]] played a dominant religious role in [[Persia]] throughout its history until the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Islamic conquest]]. As such, he would have felt a kindred spirit with the monotheistic [[Jews]].  Another possibility is the magnanimous respect he is ascribed to have evinced for the diverse beliefs and customs of the peoples within his extended kingdom. As one example, upon the conquest of Babylon itself, it is recorded that he paid homage at the temple of the Babylonian god [[Marduk]] – thereby gaining the support of the Babylonian people and minimizing further bloodshed.  While Jewish tradition, as described previously in Ezra1:1-8, indicates "the Lord inspired King Cyrus of Persia to issue this proclamation", in the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] he pays homage to Marduk. This Babylonian document has been interpreted as referring to the return to their homelands of several displaced cultural groups, one of which could have been the Jews:

[[File:Cyrus Cylinder.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Cyrus cylinder]], which confirms that Cyrus allowed [[Babylonian captivity|captives]] in [[Babylon]] to return to their native lands, earning him an honored place in Judaism.]]

:''From [Babylon] to Aššur and (from) Susa, Agade, Ešnunna, Zamban, Me-Turnu, Der, as far as the region of Gutium, the sacred centers on the other side of the Tigris, whose sanctuaries had been abandoned for a long time, I returned the images of the gods, who had resided there, to their places and I let them dwell in eternal abodes. '''I gathered all their inhabitants and returned to them their dwellings'''. In addition, at the command of Marduk, the great lord, I settled in their habitations, in pleasing abodes, the gods of Sumer and Akkad, whom Nabonidus, to the anger of the lord of the gods, had brought into Babylon.'' (lines 30-33)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder2.html The Cyrus Cylinder]. Translation based on Cogan's, published in W.H. Hallo and K.L. Younger, The Context of Scripture. Vol. II: Monumental Inscriptions from the Biblical World (2003, Leiden and Boston).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been argued that it must be referring to people associated to the image's cult instead of deportees.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kuhrt, "The Cyrus Cylinder and Achaemenid Imperial Policy", p. 86–87, in ''[[Journal for the Study of the Old Testament]]'' 25 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Diana Edelman has pointed at the serious chronological difficulties that arise when we accept that the Jews returned during the reign of Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Edelman, ''The Origins of the Second Temple: Persian Imperial Policy and the Rebuilding of Jerusalem'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms used by the author of [[Deutero-Isaiah]] are reminiscent of certain passages in the Cyrus Cylinder:&lt;ref name=Briant/&gt; Traditionally, these passages in [[Isaiah]] were believed to predate the rule of Cyrus by about 100 years, however, most modern scholars date Isaiah 40-55 (often referred to as ''[[Deutero-Isaiah]]''), toward the end of the Babylonian exile (c. 536 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sC046IfH-I8C&amp;pg=PA126 |title=From Old Revelation to New: A Tradition-Historical and Redaction-Critical ... - Simon John De Vries - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Isaiah 1-39 (referred to as ''Proto-Isaiah'') saw the destruction of Israel as imminent, and the restoration in the future, Deutero-Isaiah speaks of the destruction in the past (Isa 42:24-25), and the restoration as imminent (Isa 42:1-9). Notice, for example, the change in temporal perspective from (Isa 39:6-7), where the Babylonian Captivity is cast far in the future, to (Isa 43:14), where the Israelites are spoken of as already in Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA414 |title=Mercer Dictionary of the Bible - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar [[R. N. Whybray]], the author of Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40-55) was mistaken for he thought that Cyrus would destroy Babylon but he did not. Cyrus made it more splendid than ever. But he did allow the Jewish exiles to return home, though not in the triumphant manner which Deutero-Isaiah expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMENImo6ISYC&amp;pg=PA10 |title=Second Isaiah, R. N. Whybray |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Who roused from the east him that victory hails at every step? Who presents him with nations, subdues kings to him? His sword makes dust of them and his bow scatters them like straw. He pursues them and advances unhindered, his feet scarcely touching the road. Who is the author of this deed if not he who calls the generations from the beginning? I, the Lord, who am the first and shall be with the last''. (Isaiah 41:2-4)

Then the alliance between Cyrus and God is made explicit:
:''Thus says the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whom he has taken by his right hand to subdue nations before him and strip the loins of kings, to force gateways before him that their gates be closed no more: I will go before you levelling the heights. I will shatter the bronze gateways, smash the iron bars. I will give you the hidden treasures, the secret hoards, that you may know that I am the Lord.'' (Isaiah 45:1-3)

Among the classical Jewish sources, besides the Bible, [[Josephus]] (1st century AD) mentions that Cyrus freed the Jews from captivity and helped rebuild the temple.  He also wrote to the rulers and governors that they should contribute to the rebuilding of the temple and assisted them in rebuilding the temple.  A letter from Cyrus to the Jews is described by Josephus.:&lt;ref&gt;The Works
of Flavius Josephus ,Translated by William Whiston [http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/JOSEPHUS.HTM]

HOW CYRUS, KING OF THE PERSIANS, DELIVERED THE JEWS OUT OF BABYLON AND SUFFERED THEM TO RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND TO BUILD THEIR TEMPLE, FOR WHICH WORK HE GAVE THEM MONEY.

1. In the first year of the reign of Cyrus (1) which was the seventieth from the day that our people were removed out of their own land into Babylon, God commiserated the captivity and calamity of these poor people, according as he had foretold to them by Jeremiah the prophet, before the destruction of the city, that after they had served Nebuchadnezzar and his posterity, and after they had undergone that servitude seventy years, he would restore them again to the land of their fathers, and they should build their temple, and enjoy their ancient prosperity. And these things God did afford them; for he stirred up the mind of Cyrus, and made him write this throughout all Asia: "Thus saith Cyrus the king: Since God Almighty hath appointed me to be king of the habitable earth, I believe that he is that God which the nation of the Israelites worship; for indeed he foretold my name by the prophets, and that I should build him a house at Jerusalem, in the country of Judea."

2. This was known to Cyrus by his reading the book which Isaiah left behind him of his prophecies; for this prophet said that God had spoken thus to him in a secret vision: "My will is, that Cyrus, whom I have appointed to be king over many and great nations, send back my people to their own land, and build my temple." This was foretold by Isaiah one hundred and forty years before the temple was demolished. Accordingly, when Cyrus read this, and admired the Divine power, an earnest desire and ambition seized upon him to fulfill what was so written; so he called for the most eminent Jews that were in Babylon, and said to them, that he gave them leave to go back to their own country, and to rebuild their city Jerusalem, (2) and the temple of God, for that he would be their assistant, and that he would write to the rulers and governors that were in the neighborhood of their country of Judea, that they should contribute to them gold and silver for the building of the temple, and besides that, beasts for their sacrifices.

3. When Cyrus had said this to the Israelites, the rulers of the two tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with the Levites and priests, went in haste to Jerusalem; yet did many of them stay at Babylon, as not willing to leave their possessions; and when they were come thither, all the king's friends assisted them, and brought in, for the building of the temple, some gold, and some silver, and some a great many cattle and horses. So they performed their vows to God, and offered the sacrifices that had been accustomed of old time; I mean this upon the rebuilding of their city, and the revival of the ancient practices relating to their worship. Cyrus also sent back to them the vessels of God which king Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged out of the temple, and had carried to Babylon. So he committed these things to Mithridates, the treasurer, to be sent away, with an order to give them to Sanabassar, that he might keep them till the temple was built; and when it was finished, he might deliver them to the priests and rulers of the multitude, in order to their being restored to the temple. Cyrus also sent an epistle to the governors that were in Syria, the contents whereof here follow: 
“KING CYRUS TO SISINNES AND SATHRABUZANES SENDETH GREETING.

"I have given leave to as many of the Jews that dwell in my country as please to return to their own country, and to rebuild their city, and to build the temple of God at Jerusalem on the same place where it was before. I have also sent my treasurer Mithridates, and Zorobabel, the governor of the Jews, that they may lay the foundations of the temple, and may build it sixty cubits high, and of the same latitude, making three edifices of polished stones, and one of the wood of the country, and the same order extends to the altar whereon they offer sacrifices to God. I require also that the expenses for these things may be given out of my revenues. Moreover, I have also sent the vessels which king Nebuchadnezzar pillaged out of the temple, and have given them to Mithridates the treasurer, and to Zorobabel the governor of the Jews, that they may have them carried to Jerusalem, and may restore them to the temple of God. Now their number is as follows: Fifty chargers of gold, and five hundred of silver; forty Thericlean cups of gold, and five hundred of silver; fifty basons of gold, and five hundred of silver; thirty vessels for pouring [the drink-offerings], and three hundred of silver; thirty vials of gold, and two thousand four hundred of silver; with a thousand other large vessels. (3) I permit them to have the same honor which they were used to have from their forefathers, as also for their small cattle, and for wine and oil, two hundred and five thousand and five hundred drachme; and for wheat flour, twenty thousand and five hundred artabae; and I give order that these expenses shall be given them out of the tributes due from Samaria. The priests shall also offer these sacrifices according to the laws of Moses in Jerusalem; and when they offer them, they shall pray to God for the preservation of the king and of his family, that the kingdom of Persia may continue. But my will is, that those who disobey these injunctions, and make them void, shall be hung upon a cross, and their substance brought into the king's treasury." And such was the import of this epistle. Now the number of those that came out of captivity to Jerusalem, were forty-two thousand four hundred and sixty-two.".&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|

===Authenticity of the decree===
The historical nature of this decree has been challenged. Professor [[Lester L. Grabbe]] has argued that there was no decree but that there was a policy that allowed exiles to return to their homelands and rebuild their temples. He also argues that the archaeology suggests that the return was a "trickle" taking place over perhaps decades, resulting in a maximum population of perhaps 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grabbe|first=Lester L.|title=A History of the Jews and Judaism in the Second Temple Period: Yehud - A History of the Persian Province of Judah v. 1|year=2004|publisher=T &amp; T Clark|isbn=978-0567089984|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-MnE5T_0RbMC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;lpg=PA355&amp;dq=gave+the+Jews+permission+to+return+to+Yehud+province+and+to+rebuild+the+#v=onepage&amp;q=gave%20the%20Jews%20permission%20to%20return%20to%20Yehud%20province%20and%20to%20rebuild%20the&amp;f=false|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10675">[[File:Darius vase Napoli Museum without background.jpg|thumb|The Darius vase in the Archaeological Museum of Naples (340-320 BCE).]]
The '''Darius Vase'''  is a famous vase painted by an anonymous [[Magna Graecia]] [[Apulia]]n [[Apulian vase painting|vase painter]], commonly called the [[Darius Painter]], the most eminent representative at the end of the "Ornate Style" in [[South Italian]] [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] vase painting. The vase was produced between 340 and 320 BCE, probably in a large [[factory]]-like workshop in the Greek city of [[Taranto]] (ancient Taras), [[Magna Graecia]], well before the fall of Taranto to the [[Romans]] in 272 BCE. It is an important part of [[Apulian vase painting]].

The "Darius Vase" was discovered in 1851 near [[Canosa di Puglia]] and is now on display at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Archaeologico Nazionale]], Naples (H3253). This work, a volute ''[[krater]]''is of large dimensions. It is 1.3 meters in height and 1.93 meters in circumference.&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

The vase contains several inscriptions, such as naming individual figures, but there are also thematical names (such as ''persai'' - Persians). To some extent these inscriptions can be seen as "titles". All available space on the vase is used for figural depictions, arranged in two or three registers. Some individual zones are structured by opulent ornamental friezes. The Darius Painter is  considered the first painter to have fully exploited the possibilities of large-format vase painting. His drawing style is reputed to be especially good, particular as regards faces, which he often depicts in a three-quarter profile. 

==Content of the vase==
===Neck of the vase: Combat scenes===
[[File:Darius Vase Fight between Greeks and Persians.jpg|thumb|Combat scene between Greeks and Persians, on the neck of the vase.]]
The neck of the vase shows combat scenes between the Greeks and the Persians. It is generally thought that these scenes represents the combats between [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III]], rather than the earlier combats of the troops of [[Darius I]] during his [[First Persian invasion of Greece]].&lt;ref name="CL"/&gt;

===Top tier: Greek gods===
[[File:The war council of Darius from the Darius vase (published 1899).jpg|thumb|upright=2|The three tiers on the body of the vase: Greeks gods, War Council of Darius, and tax collection.]]
Above Darius stands a line of Greek Gods: [[Artemis]] riding a stag, [[Apollo]] seated holding a [[swan]], [[Aphrodite]] together with [[Eros]], [[Zeus]] holding a winged [[thunderbolt]], [[Hellas]] standing, [[Athena]] holding a shield, [[Apate]] holding two torches, [[Asia]] seated on an altar, next to a pillar holding a head (possibly of [[xoanon]]).&lt;ref name="CL"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Long |first1=Charlotte R. |title=The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome |date=1987 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=9004077162 |page=350 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3dUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA350 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle tier: Darius and his court===
[[Darius I]] is shown seated, wearing a long, ornate, sleeved robe and a high Persian hat. A body guard stands behind him, as Darius is listening to an allegory of the Persian people, enjoining him not to attack the Greeks.&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TH"/&gt; Darius could also be simply listening to a messenger.&lt;ref name="JM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marincola |first1=John |title=Greek Notions of the Past in the Archaic and Classical Eras |date=2012 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748654666 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zZZvAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xerxes I]], still a Prince, is said to be represented, second from right. The scene of the audience given by an Achaemenid ruler seems to have been quite conventional, and also appears in a similar fashion in the frieze on the tomb of [[Lycia]]n ruler [[Arbinas]].&lt;ref name="JM"/&gt;

===Bottom tier: tax collection=== 
A tax collector, the Royal Treasurer, is seen receiving payments by various conquered nations, who are prostred in front on him.&lt;ref name="RK"&gt;"the Royal Treasurer is seen calculating the value of the tributes paid in by the conquered nations, whose representatives crouch before him." in {{cite book |last1=Kaplan |first1=Robert |title=The Nothing that Is: A Natural History of Zero |date=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199880898 |pages=37-38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_VZ7L24HJwC&amp;pg=PT38 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a table lays a calculating table (a "recknoning board" or [[abax]], used for complicated calcutations), with a number of small pebbles or counters in front of the [[Greek numerals]] for calculating large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gow |first1=James |title=A Short History of Greek Mathematics |date=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108009034 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KSe_ZEmHaXEC&amp;pg=PA34 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Menninger |first1=Karl |title=Number Words and Number Symbols: A Cultural History of Numbers |date=2013 |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=9780486319773 |page=315 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RXbCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA315 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol "O" appears in the calculation table, a [[Boetian]] symbol for the [[obol]], or small unit.&lt;ref name="RK"/&gt; The use of pebbles on a board to make calculations is illustrated down to modern times by the fact that ''calx'' is "pebble" in Latin, which is the ethymology for the word "calculation".&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt;

The board contains the letters M (= 10.000), Ψ (Boetian for 1.000), H (= 100), Δ (= 10) and [[File:Greek Pi archaic.svg|13px]] (=5, or possibly the unit symbol for the [[Drachma]]).&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt; Next to them appear the former symbols used to represent the Greek coins: Obol (Boetian symbol O, 1/6 of a Drachma), half an Obol (С) and a quarter of an Obol (T).&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=David E. |title=History of Mathematics |date=1958 |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=9780486204307 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTytJGnTf1kC&amp;pg=PA161 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McLean |first1=Bradley Hudson |title=An Introduction to Greek Epigraphy of the Hellenistic and Roman Periods from Alexander the Great Down to the Reign of Constantine (323 B.C.-A.D. 337) |date=2002 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0472112384 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2AD3M77TgMC&amp;pg=PA61 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symbols resemble those found in the [[Abacus|Salamis abacus]].&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt; The number here shown is probably 1741 and 4/6 Drachms.&lt;ref name="KM"/&gt; The tax collector also holds an open [[diptych]] (two-leaved wax tablet) in which can be read the letters TAΛNTA:H , presumably meaning ''tal'anta hekaton''' ("one hundred [[talent]]s").&lt;ref name="DS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schärlig |first1=Alain |title=Compter avec des cailloux: le calcul élémentaire sur l'abaque chez les anciens Grecs |date=2001 |publisher=PPUR presses polytechniques |isbn=9782880744533 |page=97 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEZi3Zx0hqgC&amp;pg=PA97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
The Darius vase may have represented a scene from a Greek drama.&lt;ref name="TH"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Thomas |title=The Great Empires of the Ancient World |date=2009 |publisher=Getty Publications |isbn=9780892369874 |page=109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MDzbX7h3h-gC&amp;pg=PA109 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of Darius on his name-vase is possibly derived in its details from the ''Persae of Phrynikos'', C. Anti concluded in 1952, and Schmidt 1960 follows him. However Oliver Taplin notes in Pots and Plays, 2007, p.235-7, the only strong indications of tragic reference are Darius himself and the old man in paidagogos outfit on the plinth inscribed ΠΕΡΣΑΙ, who might be performing the messenger role. Taplin speculates that the iconography of tragedy "could be assimilated into other contexts without danger of confusion", op. cit. p.237.

The website played a key part in exposing the blasphemy bill proposed by the Norwegian government in 2009, and the "Roma woman" feature by state broadcaster [[NRK]] in 2013.

== History and impact ==
Document.no began publishing as a blog on 14 January 2003. It moved from having the form of a blog to being a news site, as more authors as Christian Skaug and Nina Hjerpset-Østlie joined the editorial team. Today it is referred to as an online magazine.&lt;ref name="Klasskmp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="journalisten"&gt;[http://www.journalisten.no/story/54119 "Fra blogg til nettavis"]. ''Journalisten''. 3 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors includes journalist and former resistance member [[Ragnar Ulstein]].&lt;ref name="VL"&gt;http://www.vl.no/reportasjer/reportasje/du-gamle-du-frie-1.356531&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011 the website reached an audience of up to 40,000 unique visitors every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article4181274.ece|work=[[Aftenposten]]|title=- Han ville organisere det nasjonalkonservative Norge|first=Kjersti|last=Nipen|date=23 July 2011|accessdate=26 July 2011|language=Norwegian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805024048/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article4181274.ece|archivedate=5 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website reached 145,000 unique monthly visitors in December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.document.no/2015/01/red-document-hadde-145-000-unike-lesere-i-desember/&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly 270 000 unique visitors in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.document.no/2016/10/18/red-document-suksessen-fortsetter-270-000-unike-ip-adresser-september/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, blogger Hanne Tolg quit her job in North Wales and joined document.no on a full-time basis after being the target of an anonymous campaign, which included unsourced claims and harassment being posted on [[RationalWiki]], as well as in Facebook groups and forums.&lt;ref&gt;Jez Hemming: [http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/north-wales-fire-service-employee-9920328 North Wales fire service employee quits amid investigation into alleged posts on far-right website], Daily Post Aug 25., downloaded Jan 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vg.no/nyheter/meninger/i/AodzE/loenn-eller-ytringsfrihet&lt;/ref&gt; According to StortBoard.mx’s list of daily top stories, articles written by Tolg topped the list of most shared articles in social media in Norway twice in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://storyboard.mx/yearinreview/no/2016/daily Norway 2016: Daily top stories] Hanne Tolg tops the lists on Dec 24, 2016 and May 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government blasphemy bill ===
The website has been cited as the main player when for the first time in Norwegian history, in 2009 "bloggers" were credited for successfully setting the national political agenda. Document.no had criticized a government "blasphemy bill", a proposed extension of §185 with regards to "hate speech so that the provision protects the need for a criminal law protection against qualified attack on religions and belief." The proposed bill was met with nearly no exposure in the mainstream media, until close to a month later, although it had been criticizised as an attack on [[democracy]] in [[Denmark|Danish]] newspapers. Eventually the bill became criticized as attacking [[freedom of speech]], and an online petition against it was supported by numerous notable figures and organisations in Norway. The pressure caused the government to later retract the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/02/04/nyheter/blasfemi/blasfemiparagrafen/politikk/innenriks/4695299/|work=[[Dagbladet]]|first=Gunnar|last=Thorenfeldt|date=4 February 2009|language=Norwegian|title=Bloggere senket regjeringens blasfemi-forslag|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fritanke.no/index.php?page=vis_nyhet&amp;NyhetID=7279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fritanke.no/index.php?page=vis_nyhet&amp;NyhetID=7284&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NRK "Roma woman" feature ===
Nina Hjerpset-Østlie, writing for document.no was the first to break a scandal regarding an eight-minute news feature about a [[Romani people|Roma]] woman in the state broadcaster NRK in January 2013. In the NRK-feature, Roma woman Mirela Mustata was presented as a victim of Norwegian law system prejudice against Roma people, however document.no could report that the woman who was presented as a victim had actually been convicted for co-conspiring to the rape of her own 11-year-old daughter, having received payment for it. It was later found that NRK had been aware of this, but chose not to report it in the feature because it, according to them, would make the case too complicated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/i/K0dqE/derfor-unnlot-nrk-aa-fortelle-om-barnevoldtekt&lt;/ref&gt; The case was gradually rolled up by other commentators and gained widespread reporting in mainstream media, causing a major scandal for NRK.&lt;ref name="Klasskmp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aften"&gt;{{cite news|title=Går alene mot strømmen|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/debatt/Gar-alene-mot-strommen-7407957.html#.UsCEN_ndfVQ|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=2013-12-18|author=Bjørn Stærk|author-link=Bjørn Stærk|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2013/01/25/kultur/debatt/nrk/media/mediekom/25431715/ "Dagsrevyens groteske journalistikk"].

==Reception==

===Media and commentators===
The site has been described by ''[[Aftenposten]]'' as "an Islam-critical and Israel-friendly, so-called blue-blog",&lt;ref name="aftenposten-document"&gt;{{cite news| title= Dynamittgubben|language= Norwegian|last=Henmo|first=Ola|work= [[Aftenposten]], A-magasinet | date = 20 February 2009| page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''[[Dagbladet]]'' as "Islam-critical and socially conservative."&lt;ref name="db040209"/&gt; ''[[Klassekampen]]'' has described it as a "leading online magazine" and has criticized it for not being transparent about the founding,&lt;ref name="Klasskmp2"&gt;[http://www.klassekampen.no/article/20140123/ARTICLE/140129985 "– Vis kortene"]. ''Klassekampen''. 23 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and among the political right's "most important arenas for debate" around immigration and Islam.&lt;ref name="Klasskmp"/&gt; The [[Norwegian Centre Against Racism]] has described it as "the closest to an intellectual arena of debate" around the same topics for many on the political far right.&lt;ref name="antiras"/&gt;

Helge Øgrim, editor of ''Journalisten'', the journal of the [[Norwegian Union of Journalists]], in July 2011 described document.no as an "anti-immigrant forum which has evolved into a hotbed of galloping Islamophobia,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article4182006.ece |work=[[Aftenposten]]|title= Retter krass kritikk mot nettsted |date=24 July 2011|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later backtracked in a comment on document.no, stating that he might have gone too far in his criticism of Rustad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.document.no/2011/09/ikke-en-gang-asne-seierstad/#comment-303806346 |work=Document.no|title= Ikke en gang Åsne Seierstad|date=6 September 2011|language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lars Gule]] described it in ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' as "a far-right web forum" that is "dominated by Islamophobic and anti-immigration commentary",&lt;ref name="vancouver"&gt;{{cite news|title=Expert says he confronted mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik about his views |author=Peter O'Neil |url=http://www2.canada.com/nanaimodailynews/news/story.html?id=c2f1e2ba-deaf-4132-b8d7-077be54f2723 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118194627/http://www2.canada.com/nanaimodailynews/news/story.html?id=c2f1e2ba-deaf-4132-b8d7-077be54f2723 |archive-date=2013-01-18 |newspaper=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the conservative Muslim commentator [[Mohammad Usman Rana]] has called it "a right-wing populist and Muslimphobic interest group".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.klassekampen.no/55777/article/item/null|work=[[Klassekampen]]|title=– Bare Frp som vinner|first=Åse|last=Brandvold|date=13 March 2009|language=Norwegian|accessdate=31 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717135849/http://www.klassekampen.no/55777/article/item/null|archivedate=17 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer on right-wing extremism [[Øyvind Strømmen]] however rejects that the website is far-right, instead describing the authors as "socially conservative immigration-opponents".&lt;ref name="utrop"/&gt; The Swedish ''[[Expo (magazine)|Expo]]'' has described it as "right-wing radical and Islamophobic",&lt;ref name="expo.se"/&gt; but according to the Norwegian Centre Against Racism, although the website includes strong criticism of immigration and Islam, it cannot be labelled far-right or outright Islamophobic even if it on occasion has published texts considered Islamophobic.&lt;ref name="antiras"/&gt;

According to ''Klassekampen'', others have praised the site for being "a serious and fact-based website" for criticism of Islam.&lt;ref name="Klasskmp2"/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described document.no as "a popular conservative Website."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/world/europe/25breivik.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;sq=document.no&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=2|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Oslo Suspect Cultivated Parallel Life to Disguise ‘Martyrdom Operation’|date=24 July 2011|accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yvonne Rundberg Savosnick, the former chairman of the Norwegian Union of Jewish Students, mentioned the site in a 2009 feature with the student newspaper at the University of Oslo, ''[[Universitas (newspaper)|Universitas]]'', because of its "critical view of the [[Media of Norway|Norwegian press]]," although she stateed that she "rarely agreed with everything" on the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://universitas.no/kultur/52765/pensum |work=Universitas |title=Pensum |date=21 January 2009|language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and former [[Aschehoug]] editor [[Halvor Fosli]] has expressed support for many of the website's positions, and has been involved in some limited publishing cooperation.&lt;ref name="Klasskmp"/&gt; [[Elin Ørjasæter]] in 2013 wrote that the site includes "journalistic pearls and fresh revelations".&lt;ref name="Klasskmp2"/&gt; ''Aftenposten'' columnist [[Bjørn Stærk]] in 2013 described document.no as "one of Norway's most important media", and as "obligatory reading" for everyone wanting to follow the immigration-debate.&lt;ref name="aften"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klasskmp2"/&gt;

In 2011, Hans Rustad complained to the Professional Committee of the Press over an article in the local newspaper ''[[Eidsvoll Ullensaker Blad]]'', which described Rustad as a chief exponent of the "brown goo", stating that "it does not matter what the spill call themselves, this is very similar to [[Nazism]]" and concluding that "we do not want Behring Breivik, Rustad and other nutjobs to set the agenda". The committee criticized the article, emphasizing that it mostly discouraged the use of the term "Nazi" when referring to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfu.no/case.php?id%3D2535 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509101220/http://www.pfu.no/case.php?id=2535 |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anders Behring Breivik===
[[Anders Behring Breivik]], the perpetrator of the [[2011 Norway attacks]], posted numerous posts on document.no (mainly in 2009) and praised the founder Hans Rustad.&lt;ref name="dn-terrorist"&gt;{{cite web|author=NTB |url=https://www.dn.no/etterBors/2011/07/23/-tungt-a-bli-rost-av-den-terrorsiktede |title=Tungt å bli rost av den terrorsiktede |publisher=DN.no |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended an open meeting of "Documents venner" (Friends of Document), affiliated with the website, in the fall of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.no/nyheter/innenriks/--Som-en-liten-gutt-2542176.html |title=Som en liten gutt |publisher=bt.no |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breivik reportedly sought to start a Norwegian version of the [[Tea Party movement]] in cooperation with the owners of document.no, who initially expressed interest but ultimately turned down his proposal because he did not have the contacts he promised.&lt;ref name="dn-terrorist"/&gt; Breivik eventually became disaffected with the website because he found it to be too moderate for his views.&lt;ref name="Klasskmp"/&gt; When Breivik was named as the arrested, the website became unreachable due to an extreme increase in traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fvn.no/nyheter/innenriks/article885799.ece |title= Document.no nede for telling |publisher=fvn.no |date= |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rustad expressed bleakness with inevitably having to be associated with Breivik, while maintaining that Breivik had disguised his extremist views through relatively moderate, non-violent user comments (which were compiled and made available on the site).&lt;ref name="dn-terrorist"/&gt;

==Guest articles==
In 2013 [[Bjørn Stærk]], a columnist in ''[[Aftenposten]]'', said that the most controversial contents of the website&lt;blockquote&gt;"are the guest articles. [[Geert Wilders]] has had several articles. [[Julia Cæsar (pseudonym)|Julia Cæsar]] had an article about African immigrants' low intelligence. Critics use this as evidence that the editorial board of Document are racists and haters of Islam. At the same time there is nothing in the commentaries by the website's permanent writers, which indicate this".&lt;ref name="aften"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''''Double Heroides''''' are a set of six [[wiktionary:epistolary|epistolary]] poems allegedly composed by [[Ovid]] in [[Latin]] [[elegiac couplet]]s, following the fifteen poems of his ''[[Heroides]]'', and numbered 16 to 21 in modern scholarly editions. These six poems present three separate exchanges of paired epistles: one each from a heroic lover from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology]] to his absent beloved, and one from the heroine in return. Ovid's authorship is uncertain.[[Image:Boswells-Ovid.jpg|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Front matter of Boswell's copy of the 1732 edition of the ''Heroides'', edited by Peter Burmann.&lt;br&gt;Note the title ''Heroides'' '''sive''' ''Epistolae'',&lt;br&gt; &amp;#8220;The ''Heroides'' '''or''' the ''Letters''&amp;#8221;.&lt;/center&gt;]]

==The Collection==
The single ''Heroides'' (1–15) are not listed here: see the [[Heroides#The collection|relevant section of that article]] for the single epistles.  The paired epistles are written as exchanges between the following heroes and heroines:

* XVI. [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] to [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], trying to persuade her to leave her husband, [[Menelaus]], and go with him to [[Troy]]
* XVII. [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]’s reply to [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], revealing her readiness to leave [[Menelaus]] for him
* XVIII. [[Hero and Leander|Leander]] to Hero, on his love for her
* XIX. [[Hero and Leander|Hero]]’s reply to Leander, on her love for him
* XX. [[Acontius]] to [[Cydippe]], on his love for her, reminding her of her commitment to marry him
* XXI. [[Cydippe]]’s reply to [[Acontius]], agreeing to marry him

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3003">'''Dynamic meditation''' is a form of [[meditation]] in which physical actions are involved. The term appears in the early 1970s when [[Rajneesh|Osho]]'s descriptions of his "Rajneesh Dhyan Yoga," developed at meditation camps in the Indian mountains, were translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lewis F. "Charisma and Control in Rajneeshpuram: A Community without Shared Values, [[Cambridge University Press]] 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-38554-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prototypical method is still named "Dynamic Meditation."

The term has come into more general use to describe any approach to meditation that includes movement: examples are ''[[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]'' and ''[[Haḍra]]'' among the [[Sufi]] mystics, the [[Gurdjieff movements]], in the Dynamic Body Awareness ([[:fr:Conscience_Corporelle_Dynamique|Conscience corporelle dynamique]] or [[:it:Consapevolezza_corporea_dinamica|Consapevolezza corporea dinamica]]) created in France by artist and anthropologist Martino Nicoletti and other [[sacred dance]]s, ''[[Qigong]]'' and the many exercises developed in [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]], in [[India]] those found in [[Yoga]] and [[Tantra]], and the [[Latihan]] of [[Subud]].

==History==
Many cultures have traditions of meditative movement. Japan has '''[[Katsugen undō]]''' (regenerating movement exercise, 活元運動, かつげんうんどう), a '''[[Seitai]]''' exercise developed by Haruchika Noguchi in which one lets go of conscious control of the body and allows it to heal itself. In China there is also Zifagong, Re-do and Zi Ran Qigong and in Japan Seitai.

In Iran and Turkey there is Mevlevi Dervish or '''[[Sufi whirling]]'' which originally was spontaneous and impromptu. The origin of Sama is credited to [[Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī]] (Persian: جلال‌الدین محمد رومی), Sufi master and founder of the [[Mevlevi Order]]. The story is that Rumi was walking through the town marketplace one day when he heard the rhythmic hammering of the goldbeaters. It is believed that Rumi heard the [[dhikr]], "la ilaha ilallah" or in English, "no god but Allah" in the apprentices beating of the gold, and was so entranced in bliss he stretched out both of his arms and started spinning in a circle. With that the practice of Sama and the dervishes of the Mevlevi order were born.

==Practice==
Osho believed that cathartic methods were necessary, since it was difficult for modern people to just sit and enter meditation; "I never tell people to begin with just sitting. With a mad dance, you begin to be aware of a silent point within you; with sitting silently, you begin to be aware of madness."&lt;ref&gt;Osho, "Meditation, the Art of Ecstasy", Rajneesh Foundation, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; His "dialectical" methods alternate activity and passivity, adapting elements of ''[[mantra]]'' and ''[[pranayama]]'', ''[[latihan]]'', [[kirtan]] and psychotherapeutic [[catharsis]].

{{Greek myth (nymph)}}
The '''Eleionomae''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|l|iː|ˈ|ɒ|n|əm|i}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: Ἐλειονόμαι) or '''Heleionomai''' ([[Ancient Greek]]:Ἑλειονομοι "marsh dwelling" derived from ''heleios''  and ''nomos'') were the [[naiads]] of marshes and wetlands in ancient [[Greek mythology]]. Aside from living in marshy environments, the Eleionomae often misled travelers with their illusions. The illusions constituted images of a traveler's loved ones. These nymphs also lured young, virgin boys and seduced them with their beauty.

'''Fitzroy Island''' (originally ''Koba'' or ''Gabar'') is a [[continental island]] out from ''Djujbirri'' (formally known as Cape Grafton), 29&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Cairns]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It is a [[Suburbs and localities (Australia)|locality]] in the [[Cairns Region]].&lt;ref name=qpnl&gt;{{cite QPN|48635|Fitzroy Island|locality in Cairns Region|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite QPN|12563|Fitzroy Island (Goon-Gan-Jee Island)|Island in Cairns Region|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Fitzroy Island is a large tropical island, with a rainforest covering and its own fringe coral reef system.  The island has a total area of 339 hectares (838 acres).  The highest point of the island is 375&amp;nbsp;metres above sea level.

Fitzroy Island is a 45-minute ferry ride (about 30&amp;nbsp;km) from Cairns and is surrounded by a reef system that forms part of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]].  Nearly all of the continental island is protected within the [[Fitzroy Island National Park]].  It is covered in tropical rainforest.  Four walking tracks have been established.&lt;ref name="afi"/&gt;

== Climate ==
Fitzroy enjoys a typical North Queensland [[tropical climate]] but with the added advantage of the cooling effects of the prevailing southeasterly ocean breezes for the majority of the year. Temperatures range from 24 - 31 C (75 - 88 F) in summer and 19 - 25 C (66 - 77 F) in winter.
[[Image:Sunset fitzroyisland.JPG|thumb|upright|Sunset over Welcome Bay, Fitzroy Island]]

== History ==
The island separated from the mainland about 8000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age. There were Aboriginal visits, mainly for visiting hunting trips and recreation.

Lieutenant [[James Cook]] named the island in 1770 after [[Augustus Henry FitzRoy|Augustus Henry Fitzroy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="afi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/fitzroy-island/about.html |title=About Fitzroy Island |date=6 February 2013 |publisher=Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing |accessdate=25 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616004755/http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/fitzroy-island/about.html |archivedate=16 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was used for a considerable time as a significant Chinese quarantine station for the Queensland goldfields.&lt;ref name="afi" /&gt; Subsequently it was used as a mission school and during [[World War II]], as a coast watch station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ww2places.qld.gov.au/places/?id=623|title=Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) 28 Radar Station, Fitzroy Island|last=|first=|date=|website=Queensland World War II Historic Places|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506215324/https://www.ww2places.qld.gov.au/places/?id=623|archive-date=6 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=7 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The island has also been important as a significant lighthouse base, with the last permanent [[Fitzroy Island Light|lighthouse]] structures on the main island still being an important community attraction. Since its closure the marine community has been serviced with an automatic lighthouse based on the adjacent Little Fitzroy Island. There has been both a [[giant clam]] farm at Welcome Bay and now a tourist resort and day visitor centre.

==Resort==
The island is home to a 100-room resort. Property developer Doug Gamble bought and renovated the resort in 2010.&lt;ref name="nbfi"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/3008006/nudey-beach-fitzroy-island-queensland-from-nudist-favourite-to-family-friendly/?cs=34 |title=Nudey Beach, Fitzroy Island, Queensland: From nudist favourite to family friendly |author= |accessdate=25 April 2015 |date=13 April 2015 |newspaper=The Wimmera Mail-Times |publisher=Fairfax Media |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506215325/https://www.mailtimes.com.au/story/3008006/nudey-beach-fitzroy-island-queensland-from-nudist-favourite-to-family-friendly/?cs=34 |archivedate=6 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resort manages the camping area.&lt;ref name="afi"/&gt;

'''Godianism''' (also called '''Chiism''') is a [[religious movement]] which was established in 1948 in [[Nigeria]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
The founder and Supreme Spiritual Teacher of Godianism, [[Ahanyi, Kalu Onu Kama Onyioha]], stated that he intends to correct the notion that [[African traditional religion]]s are "[[pagan]]".

According to Ahanyi, K.O.K. Onyioha, “Paganism and heathenism were two of the most common words used by western colonialists and their Christian missionaries who accompanied them, when referring to the religious beliefs that existed in Africa. This was because of their ignorance of the principles and the doctrines for which this religion stood. But at least now, they know and are aware that what they once mischievously labeled as paganism and heathenism were neither pagan nor heathen but a religion and spirituality, which had stimulated the growth of great cultures and civilizations in Africa.”

Godianism has been the oldest spirituality of Africa{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. It is in the cradle of Chiism that the African people grew{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. The adherents of this religious movement believe that Godianism will help the children of Africa to rejuvenate themselves in unity and solidarity.

Godianism does not look down upon or despise another religion, nor does it use force or coercion to impose its belief on others. With its message of universal unity and its philosophy of 'biri ka'm biri' (live and let live), it serves as an eye opener to those who still peddle religion in the market place by means fair and/or foul to win the world for this 'ism' or that 'ism'.Godianism on the other hand brings harmony and unity among the people of different religions in spite of their diversities. Humanity should eventually understand that harmony is the keynote of the universe. Equality in the universe throbs with a harmonious rhythm. Any disturbance of this rhythm will spell suffering and bring disorder and chaos.

Godianism intends to bring this needed harmony first among the peoples of Africa and subsequently offer it to the world as food for thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.godianism.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion has since spread to other parts of [[West Africa]], particularly [[Ghana]]. A former [[Catholic]] priest, and former member of the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] of Ghana after the [[coup]] by [[Jerry Rawlings]] in 1982, named [[Vincent Kwabena Damuah]] wrote a booklet entitled ''Miracle at the shrine:religious and revolutionary miracle in Ghana'' under the name Osofo Okomfo Damuah, which has been very influential in helping the new faith develop in Ghana.

Godianism has, since its inception in Nigeria during the fight for independence from Great Britain, turned from one that was founded with pronounced political motives to a movement that has developed and displayed strong cultural and philosophical aspects, and is viewed as being a "philosophical reflection on African traditional religious customs".

==Principles==
The religion holds that [[Igbo mythology#Chukwu/Chineke|Chineke]] is the creator of the universe. Igbo people of Eastern Nigeria believe the [[Igbo language]] as being one of the languages used by Chineke with which to communicate with mortals, including in the faith's book, called the ''Nkomii''.

The major [[Abrahamic faith]]s, including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], are all said to be derived from the original teachings contained in this book.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of Godianism is to renovate the person spiritually to enable him/her to co-relate in harmony with the rest of humanity. But the physical bearing of a person is not only the prima facie evidence of the complexion of that person's heart, but also offers for him/her the first attraction for acceptance into a harmonious relationship with others in the society. In efforts of Godianism to promote harmony among humanity every Chiist (Godian) encourages his/her neighbor to embrace personal cleanliness, and by refraining from such repulsive habits such as smoking and excessive drinking of intoxicants.

== The Origin of God-Symbols ==
To thank God, the African ancestors would wish they could see God in person so that they could express their gratitude. But since that was not possible, it became their duty to create an artistic image of Him in the shape of a replica they fashioned from wood. This replication or God-symbol resembled their racial features—black color, woolly hair. By making this replica, they are expressing the fact that they do not know what God looks like, but that this is what they imagine him to be .&lt;ref&gt;African Godianism by Chief K.O.K. Onyioha&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Chiist (Godian) creed ==
The entire spirit, philosophy and purpose of Godianism are compressed into the following creed of the Godian Religion:
# I believe in the Almighty God, Creator of heaven and Earth, as my source of inspiration, strength and as my protector.
# I believe in the universal brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of one God; love your neighbor as you love yourself; do unto others as you would want others to do unto you;thou shall not kill; thou shall not steal; thou shall not commit adultery; thou shall not lie; and in respect and obedience to elders, just laws, and in retributive justice.
# I believe that every human being, consciously or unconsciously, looks up to something above him as his source of inspiration, and that "something" is the Almighty God.
# I believe that the Almighty God made the world a paradise of happiness for humanity but that man has made the world a hell for himself by too much quarrels with his fellow man over methods of God-worship.
# I believe that the Kingdom of Heaven on earth shall come when man learns to quarrel no more with his fellow man on the excuse of difference in methods of God-worship.
# I believe that religious concepts are inspired by man's desire to offer thanks to God for His goodness to humanity.
# I believe that every human being has his own way, organized or unorganized, systematized or unsystematized, of expressing the necessary gratitude to God, and that in this fact every human being satisfies the purpose of religion or God-worship.
# I believe that there is no sense in quarreling with my fellow man over his religious doctrine, belief or methods of God-worship that differ from my own manner of satisfying the common purpose of thanksgiving to the Almighty.
# I believe that to base association of man with man, nation with nation, on the ground of common religion and faith, is sheer folly.
# I believe that every man should have the right to worship God in the way he understands best, without bitterness.
# I believe that any attempt to force man directly or indirectly to accept any particular faith, religious doctrine or method of God-worship rumples social harmony.
# I believe that organized religious bodies as they are known in the world today, though the fundamental principles underlying their purposes are good, have, by each in its way canvassing to have all men embrace its doctrines, aroused unhealthy competition and mutual jealousy among themselves and blown the world into tumultuous asylum of warring religious factions.
# I believe that if the universal brotherhood of man under the fatherhood of God shall be a reality, if the Kingdom of God shall come, the traditional African attitude of live and let live in all matters of religion is the indispensable catalyst.
# I believe that deification of man has given source to the formation of the many religious organizations now competing and quarreling with one another, each in frantic attempts to get everybody to accept and hallow the man it has deified as the only son, holy prophet, and only medium through whom God's mercy and blessings should be invoked.
# I believe that the practice of deification of man shall continue to be the source of disharmony in matters of God-worship unless it is stopped.
# I believe that to deify any person born of woman or to accept and hallow anyone so deified is conspiracy against social harmony and sinful contempt for the very sanctity of God.
# I believe that to end deification of man and hang religion directly on God is to end proliferation of religions and religious quarrels and in return peace among men.
# I believe that the Creed of Godian Religion represents a new religious civilization which needs to be propagated to save human society from total destruction.

== Violence and non-violence ==
The religion of Godianism believes in one part that the response to a threat is usually violent and that it is part of man, by nature, on the principle of self-preservation. To say that non-violence in a violent human society, in which society is ranged against man, oppression against freedom and repression against life itself, is to Godianism a clamor which does not accord with the fact of human nature and the law of self-preservation. Godianism teaches that man should forgive offenders. But that the law of karma, which is universal, governs the world. Good comes to those who do good and bad comes to those who do bad. Sinners will definitely face the consequences of their actions except they seek forgiveness from the offended person and truly from God. A genuine repentance purifies the human soul and therefore behaviour.  Godianism believes that the human life is sacred and that it should not be destroyed under any circumstance.

According to Godianism, the only way to non-violence is to reconstruct human society in the various fronts of human interactions into systems that conduce to harmonious relationship among men—into systems that do not expose man to any sense of insecurity or social injustice to stimulate the violence which is part of his nature dormant in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;African Godianism by Chief K.O.K. Onyioha, pp.72-74&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs on appearance ==
It is a cardinal point in the aesthetics of Godianism that all Godians must at all times turn out neat. Clothings are to be well washed and clean, the hair on the head should be well-cut, and the beard should be clean-shaven. The Godian must observe proper hygiene and impeccable sanitation for his surroundings. The Godian woman must have her hair neatly plaited or set. It is believed that it would be undermining the objective of Godianism to promote harmonious relationships among men if Godians wore dirty looks.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
The '''Grand Mufti''' ({{lang-ar|مفتي عام}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|muftī ʿām&amp;#x202f;}}'', "general [[wikt:expounder|expounder]]" or {{lang|ar|كبير المفتين}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kabīr al-muftīn&amp;#x202f;}}'', "the great of expounders") is the highest official of religious [[law]] in a [[Sunni]] or [[Ibadi]] [[Muslim]] country. The Grand [[Mufti]] issues legal opinions and edicts, [[fatwas]], and interpretations of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] for private clients or to assist judges in deciding cases. The collected opinions of the Grand Mufti serve as a valuable source of information on the practical application of Islamic law as opposed to its abstract formulation. The Grand Mufti's fatāwā (plural of "fatwā") are non-binding precedents in areas of civil laws regulating marriage, divorce, and inheritance. In criminal courts, the Grand Mufti's recommendations are generally not binding either.

==History==
Muftis are Muslim religious scholars who issue influential legal opinions (fatwas) interpreting [[Sharia]] ([[Islam]]ic law).&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saudí: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004110625}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–20}} The [[Ottoman Empire]] began the practice of giving official recognition and status to a single mufti, above all others, as the Grand Mufti.&lt;ref name="Vogel"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The Grand Mufti of [[Istanbul]] had, since the late 16th century, come to be regarded as the head of the religious establishment.&lt;ref name="Faroqh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faroqhi|first1=Suraiya N.|title=The Cambridge History of Turkey.

==Types==

===State-appointed Grand Muftis===
====Ottoman Caliphate====
In the [[Ottoman Caliphate]], the Grand Mufti was a state official, and the Grand Mufti of [[Constantinople]] was the highest of these.

====Jerusalem====
Throughout the era of British colonialism, the British retained the institution of Grand Mufti in some Muslim areas under their control and accorded the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]] the highest political stature in Palestine. During [[World War I]] (1914–1918), there were two competing Grand Muftis of Jerusalem, one endorsed by the British and one by the  [[Ottoman Empire]]. When Palestine was under British rule, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was a position appointed by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] authorities. In the [[Palestinian National Authority]], the [[Public administration|administrative]] [[organization]] established to [[government|govern]] parts of the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]], the Grand Mufti is appointed by the president.

====Saudi Arabia====
The [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]], with office created in 1953, is appointed by the King.

====Brunei====
The State Mufti of [[Brunei]] is nominated by the Sultan.

====Tunisia====
According to Article 78 of the [[Constitution of Tunisia|2014 Constitution]], the General Mufti of Tunisia is appointed and can be dismissed by the [[President of Tunisia|President of the Republic]].&lt;ref name=engcon&gt;{{cite book|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TUNISIAN REPUBLIC (Unofficial english translation)|date=26 January 2014|publisher=UNDP and International IDEA|chapter=Title four, chapter one, article 78|url=http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2014.01.26_-_final_constitution_english_idea_final.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210602/http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/2014.01.26_-_final_constitution_english_idea_final.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries such as [[Australia]] where the [[Grand Mufti of Australia|office of Grand Mufti]] receives no official seal of government [[imprimatur]], clerics can be elected to the position by one segment of the Islamic community in that country and yet not be recognised by other Muslim communities in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Alexander|title=Cultural Anthropology: The Field Study of Human Beings|date=1998|publisher=Collegiate Press|location=San Diego, California|isbn=0939693488|page=389|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nations with collective Grand Muftis===
* [[Indonesia]] has a system of collective mufti, in which the position of Grand Mufti is held by the Indonesian Ulama Council ([[Majelis Ulama Indonesia]]). This assembly can make fatāwā.
* [[Malaysia]] also has a unique system of collective mufti. Nine of the fourteen Malaysian states have their own [[constitutional monarchy]]; nine are ruled by their own constitutional monarch while the country is led by a monarch elected from the nine. These nine monarchs have authority over religious matters within their own states: therefore, each of these nine states have their own mufti who usually controls the Islamic Council or Islamic Department of the state. At the national level, a National Council of Fatwa (Majlis Fatwa Kebangsaan) has been formed under the Department of Islamic Advancement of Malaysia (Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia or JAKIM). JAKIM appoints five Muftis for the five states which do not have monarchs. The muftis of the nine monarchical states, together with the five officials appointed by JAKIM in the National Council of Fatwā, collectively issue fatāwā at the national level.
*[[Sri Lanka]] has a system of collective ulama from different traditions of Islam. The [[All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama]] has a [[President]] who oversees the decisions but does not necessarily have the powers to overturn any decisions made by rest of the ulama. The concept is similar to a [[democracy|democratic]] [[coalition]] system. The current president is Ash-Sheikh Mufti M.I.M. Rizwe.

'''Iftar (or Fatoor)''' ({{lang-ar|إفطار}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA| ʾifṭār&amp;nbsp;}}'' 'break fast') is the [[Supper|evening meal]] with which [[Muslim]]s end their daily [[Ramadan]] [[Sawm|fast]] at sunset. [[Muslim]]s break their fast at the time of the [[adhan|call to prayer]] for the [[maghrib prayer|evening prayer]]. This is their second meal of the day; the daily fast during Ramadan begins immediately after the pre-dawn meal of [[Suhur]] and continues during the daylight hours, ending with sunset with the evening meal of Iftar.

== Description ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Iftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their [[Fasting|fast]] together. Iftar is taken just after the call to prayer ''[[Maghrib]]'', which is around [[sunset]]. Traditionally but not mandatory, three [[Date (fruit)|dates]] are eaten to break the fast in emulation of the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic Prophet]] [[Muhammad]], who broke his fast in this manner. Many Muslims believe that feeding someone iftar as a form of [[Sadaqah|charity]] is very rewarding and that such was practised by the Prophet Muhammad.

AH Qasmi provides this information for breaking the fast to say this prayer at the time of Iftar: {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

{{cquote|O [[Allah]]! it is for thee that I observe fast and it is with Thy blessing that I break it.}}

according to a publication of South Africa:{{cn|date=June 2018}}

{{cquote|Allahuma inni laka sumtu wa 'ala rizqika aftartu - "O Allah! for thy sake I have fasted and now I break the fast with the food that comes from thee."}}

== Around the world ==
=== Afghanistan ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In [[Afghanistan]], Iftar usually includes the traditional dates, shorwa (soup), [[kebab]]s, du piyaza (meat stewed in an onion-based sauce), [[Manti (dumpling)|manto]] (seasoned, minced meat wrapped in pasta), [[kabuli pulao|kabuli palaw]] (rice with lentils, raisins, carrots, and lamb), shorm beray, bolani (fried or baked flat bread with a vegetable filling), and rice, as well as other dishes. Afghans also have an extensive range of sweet dishes and desserts.

=== Bangladesh ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
&lt;!-- The names of these foods should probably be lowercased --&gt;
[[Image:Common Iftar Dish.jpg|thumb|Common iftar items of [[Bangladesh]]]]
[[File:Iftar beguni.JPG|thumb|Iftar food items in [[Dhaka]]]]
In [[Bangladesh]], a wide variety of foods is prepared to break the fast at Maghrib time. Some of the common iftar items from [[Bangladeshi cuisine]] include Piyajoo (made of [[lentils]] paste, chopped onions, green chilies, like [[falafel]]), [[Beguni]] (made of thin slices of eggplant dipped in a thin batter of gram flour), [[Jalebi|Jilapi]], Muri ( puffed rice similar to [[Rice krispies]]), yellow lentil grains, usually soaked in water and spiced with onion, garlic, chilli and other iftar items), [[Haleem|Halim]], dates, [[samosa]]s, Dal Puri (a type of [[lentil]] based [[savoury (small dish)|savoury]] pastry), Chola (cooked [[chickpea]]s), kebab, [[mughlai]] [[paratha]] (stuffed [[Paratha|porota]] with minced meat and spices), [[pitha]], traditional Bengali sweets and different types of fruits such as watermelon. Bengalis open their fast with all their friends and family and eat together in a banquet with their array of food however savoury items are eaten before sweet.

Drinks such as lemon [[sharbat|shorbot]] and yoghurt sharbat(made of yoghurt, water, sugar and [[Rooh_Afza|rooh afza]]) are common on iftar tables across the country. People like to have iftar at home with all family members and iftar parties are also arranged by mosques. According to the prophet Muhammed, you should first break your fast with something sweet or with a prayer. Many break their fasts in Bangladesh by eating a kajur or a date and by saying one of the surahs in the Qur'an. People often distribute iftar in mosques for the people praying to eat believing it is a good deed. After Iftar people pray [[maghrib]] and later [[Isha prayer|Isha]] then many head straight for [[Taraweeh]] prayers where 20 rakats are performed to finish one [[Juz']] of the Quran.

=== Brunei ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In [[Brunei Darussalam]], iftar is locally referred to as "sungkai". Traditionally this is held at a regional or village [[mosque]] for those who have or will be performing the evening prayers. At the mosque, a mosque [[buffet]] is prepared by the local residents at which all are welcomed to break their fast together. Before the iftar, the ''[[Bedug|beduk]]'' (a type of drum) must be heard as a signal to begin the sungkai. In the capital [[Bandar Seri Begawan]], the firing of several cannons at the central business district also marks the sungkai. The sungkai is generally a welcomed time of the day, so [[Bruneian people|Bruneians]] occasionally break their fast at restaurants along with their extended family. Additionally, only during the month of Ramadan, each district will be hosting an expansive network of ''tamu'' or Ramadan stalls with the exception of Brunei and Muara district, where freshly cooked [[Cuisine of Brunei|local delicacies]] are sold more than other time of the year.

=== India ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Different types of food items on Ifter plate.jpg|thumb|Different types of food items on Ifter plate]]
In [[India]], almost every [[Muslim]] stops to rejoice for a few minutes following the iftar sirens and ''[[adhan]]''.  Muslims break their fasts with family and friends, with most Mosques also arranging free 'iftar'. Preparations for iftar commence hours before, in homes and at roadside stalls. Iftar begins by eating dates or drinking water, but this is only the opening of a rich meal. The spread of 'iftar' can be grand, with both vegetarian to non-vegetarian dishes and a variety of juices and [[sherbet (drink)|sherbet]]s. Iftar usually is a heavy meal and is followed by a second, lighter dinner eaten before the night ([[Isha'a|isha]]) prayers and the [[taraweeh]] prayers.

In [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and nearby areas, people often break their fast with [[Hyderabadi haleem|Haleem]] because it has a rich taste and is quite filling. In other southern states ([[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), Muslims break their fast with ''nonbu kanji'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/09/21/stories/2009092150900200.htm|title=The Hindu : Tamil Nadu / Tiruchi News : &amp;#8216;Nonbu Kanji,&amp;#8217; a noble thing that paves way for communal harmony|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rich, filling rice dish of porridge consistency, cooked for hours with meat and vegetables. This is often served with [[bonda]], [[Pakora|bajji]], and [[vadai]]. Vegetarians break their fast with a dish called surkumba, which is prepared from milk, and this is particularly popular in certain parts of [[Karnataka]]. In northern states like [[Delhi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]], the fast is typically ended with fresh [[Date (fruit)|dates]], cut fresh fruits (sometimes served as [[chaat]]) and fruit juice along with fried dishes like [[samosas]], [[pakodas]] etc.

=== Indonesia ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
[[Image:JackfruitKolak.jpg|thumb|[[Jackfruit]] [[kolak]], one of various iftar desserts in Indonesia]]
In [[Indonesia]] iftar is called "buka puasa", which means "to open the fast". Markets sell various foods for iftar, including the date, which is popular, as well as unique [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesian sweet food and drink]] such as [[kolak]], [[es kelapa muda]], [[es buah]], [[es campur]], [[cendol]] or dawet, etc. Most of them are only found easily in Ramadan. Iftar is usually begun by eating these sweets, as inspired by the Prophet's [[Sunnah]] of eating dates, and this small meal is known as Takjil.

Maghrib time is traditionally marked by the [[Bedug]], a traditional big Indonesian drum. After [[salat|Asr prayers]], traditional markets will begin to open. The food stalls generally sell many kinds of items that are specifically for "iftar". Traffic jams often occur leading up to Maghrib time. Sometimes people invite groups of orphans to eat with them. After Iftar and maghrib prayer which is usually done at the homes, people go to the mosque for [[Isha'a]] and [[Tarawih]] prayer, which in Indonesia, is often accompanied by a short sermon known as "ceramah" before the Tarawih prayer commence.

[[File:Iftar Iranian 2015.JPG|thumb|An example of Iranian Iftar table. Dinner will be served later.]]
In [[Iran]], a small selection of foods is prepared to break the fast at Maghrib time (just after sunset) and is summarily followed by a proper [[Iranian cuisine|Persian meal]]. Most common iftar items are: Chai (tea, usually [[Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling]]) with [[zulbia and bamiyeh]], [[date palm|dates]], [[halva]], and other sweets, ''[[naan|Noon]]'' (bread usually [[lavash]] or [[Barbari bread|barbari]]) and ''paneer'' ([[cheese]], usually [[feta]]) with [[Leaf vegetable|greens]] and fresh herbs. Most family members will gather at one home for iftar.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}} 
[[File:Bandung Drinks.jpg|thumb|right|[[bandung (drink)|Bandung drink]], the most common drinks during Iftar in Malaysia]]
In [[Malaysia]], iftar is known as "berbuka puasa", which literally means "to open the fast". As usual, the Muslims break the fast with either dried or fresh dates. Various foodstuffs from the [[Malaysian cuisine]] tend to be readily available from ''Bazaar Ramadhan''s, which are street food markets that are open during Ramadan; local favourites include [[bandung (drink)|bandung drink]], [[sugarcane juice]], [[soybean milk]] mixed with [[grass jelly]], ''[[nasi lemak]]'', ''[[laksa]]'', ''ayam percik'', [[Hainanese chicken rice|chicken rice]], [[satay]] and [[popiah]] among others. Many high-end restaurants and hotels also provide special iftar and dinner packages for those who want to break the fast outside with families and friends. Furthermore, most mosques also provide free ''bubur lambok'' (a special type of [[rice congee]]) after Asar prayers.

Most Muslims will usually have a special supper after performing their ''[[tarawih]]'' prayers called ''moreh'' (pronounced {{IPA-may|moˈreh|}}). The light meal, taking place in mosque and prayer hall grounds, consists of local traditional snacks and hot tea.

=== Maldives ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In the [[Maldives]], iftar is known as ''roadha villun'', which means "break fast". As usual, most Muslims break the fast with either dried or fresh dates. There are many exclusive restaurants and hotels providing special iftar and dinner packages for those who want to break the fast outside with the families and friends. All the mosques in the Maldives provide free dates and juice to break fast. At local homes you will find various cold fruit juices (water melon, mango, passion fruit, pineapple) sweet (boakiba, pudding) and salty shorteats called hedhika (boakiba, bajiya, gulha, masroshi, cutlets), the latter made with mainly fish, curries, roshi and salads made with local greens, chilli, onion and lemon.

=== Nigeria ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Nigeria easily hosts the largest Muslim community in [[West Africa]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Iftar (known in the [[Yoruba language]] as ''isinu'') holds the same importance in Nigeria's [[Sunni]] population as the rest of the Islamic world. Foods include [[Jollof rice]], [[suya]], [[egusi|ọbẹ̀ ẹgúsí]], [[goat meat|ewurẹ]], [[Acarajé|àkàrà]], [[date palm|dabinu/dabino]], [[common fig|ọ̀pọ̀tọ́]], etc.

=== Pakistan ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Samosa fried.JPG|thumb|[[Samosa]]s are a common Iftari snack in Pakistan.]]
In [[Pakistan]], almost everybody stops to rejoice for a few minutes following the iftar sirens and [[adhan]] (call to prayer). Preparations for iftar commence about 3 hours before, in homes and at roadside stalls. The fast can be ended by eating dates, or simply by drinking water, if dates are not available. Many restaurants offer iftar deals, especially in the big cities like [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], and [[Islamabad]]. As a [[Pakistani cuisine|meal in Pakistan]], iftar is usually heavy, consisting mainly of sweet and savoury treats such as [[jalebi]] (pretzel-shaped, deep-fried batter, soaked in sugar syrup), [[samosas]] (minced meat and/or vegetables, wrapped in dough and deep-fried or baked), [[pakora]] (sliced vegetables, dipped in batter and deep-fried) with ketchup or chatni, and [[namak para]] (seasoned cracker), besides the staple dates and water.

Other items such as [[chicken rolls]], [[spring roll]]s, [[Shami Kebab]]s, [[fruit salads]], [[papad]] (sheets of batter that are then sun-dried, deep-fried or roasted until they have the texture of potato chips or crisps), chana chaat (chickpea salad), and dahi balay (or "dahi baray"—fried lentil dumplings served with yoghurt) are also very common. Amongst the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]], [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] and [[Muhajir people|Mohajir]] households, iftar is often followed up by a regular dinner later during the night. Those in the north and west, including [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Baloch people|Balochis]], and [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], on the other hand combine dinner and iftar. [[La mian|Laghman]] soup (noodle soup), locally called Kalli, is an iftar staple in [[Chitral]] and parts of [[Gilgit]].

After iftar, Muslims rush to the mosques to offer [[Tarawih]] (an 8 or 20 [[rakat]] Muslim prayer during the month of Ramadan). Various television channels also stop their normal telecast and broadcast special Ramadan transmissions, especially at the time of Sehar and Iftar. The whole month of Ramadan is marked in Pakistan as a festive season when people make donations to the poor and give charity. Some organizations and companies also offer free iftar meals to the common people.

=== Russia and Ukraine ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In Russia and Ukraine, Ramadan is observed mostly in Muslim-majority states: ([[Dagestan]], [[Chechnya]], [[Ingushetia]], [[Adygea]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Karachay-Cherkessia]], [[Crimea]], [[Tatarstan]] and [[Bashkortostan]]). In Moscow and Kiev, it has become a tradition to open Ramadan Tent, a public iftar event organised by [[Russia's Mufti Council]] and [[Religious Administration of Muslims of Ukraine|Ukraine's Religious Administration of Muslims]]. In Dagestan, Muslims gather in Makhachkala Central Juma Mosque to break their fast and pray [[taraweeh]] prayers. Dates and fruits are preferred to break the fast, followed by soup, bread, and different local delicacies such as [[beşbarmaq]], [[Kürze mantı|kurze]] and others. It is widely believed that Russian and Ukrainian traditional drink [[kvass]] is very good to quell the thirst.

=== Singapore ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In [[Singapore]], iftar is called "buka puasa". It is usually accompanied with dates and sweet drinks such as Bandung, Chendol and Air Sirap. Singaporean Muslims usually eat an array of dishes ranging from rice and noodles. Many buy food from bazaars that can be found in different parts of the city state such as in Bugis, Kampong Glam, Geylang Serai and even in populated towns such as Tampines, Jurong East, Jurong West, Clementi and West Coast.

=== Sri Lanka ===
[[Muslims]] in [[Sri Lanka]] make [[Cuisine of Sri Lanka|special snacks /appetisers]] at Muslim homes, such as [[samosas]], cutlets, rolls, kanjee, [[falooda]] and many more dishes. They eat iftar with the family if possible. Muslims believe that giving to the poor is very rewarding. They eat a date and drink some water to break the fast or to perform iftar. Then they have the prepared meal. Some people like to prepare foods and give to the people performing iftar in the mosques.

=== Taiwan ===
[[File:Taipei Grand Mosque - Fast Break.JPG|thumb|Iftar at [[Taipei Grand Mosque]], [[Taiwan]]]]
Islam is a growing{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} minority religion in [[Taiwan]]. During Ramadan, major mosques around Taiwan are filled with Muslims going to have their iftar followed by Tarawih prayer. Muslims in Taiwan usually break their fast with [[Date (fruit)|dates]] and water.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Trinidad and Tobago ===
In [[Trinidad and Tobago]] Muslims represent about 6% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Islam in Trinidad and Tobago]]&lt;/ref&gt; Iftar is traditionally performed in the social setting of the Masjid. Various food items showing the mixed ethnic nature of the country are usually available. Fare may include fried rice; [[roti]]; curried chicken, goat, and duck; curried channa; and alloo (potato). Depending on the persons presenting the meal, it may even include such non-traditional items as macaroni pie. The meal is usually served with persons sitting at tables with the components of the meal brought to the tables.

=== Turkey and Northern Cyprus ===
[[Image:Istanbul.Sultanahmet.BlueMosque.Ramazan.02.jpg|thumb|[[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] with the ''kandil''s lit. The lights in this example spell out holiday greetings.]]
In [[Turkey]] and [[Northern Cyprus]], the month of Ramadan is celebrated with great joy, and iftar dinners play a big part in this. In larger cities like [[Istanbul]] all of the restaurants offer special deals and set menus for iftar. Most of the set menus start with a soup or an appetiser platter called ''iftariye''. It consists of dates, olives, cheese, [[pastırma]], [[sujuk]], [[Ramazan pidesi]] (a special bread only baked during Ramadan), and various pastries called ''[[börek]]''. The main course consists of various [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish foods]], especially the [[Ottoman cuisine|Ottoman Palace Traditional Foods]]. A dessert called ''[[güllaç]]''- is served in most places. Most of the fine-dining restaurants offer live musical performances of [[Ottoman classical music]], [[Music of Turkey|Turkish music]] and [[Sufi music]].

Most of the Ramadan celebration practices in Turkey have their roots in the traditions of the former [[Ottoman Empire]]. At the [[minaret]]s of mosques, lights called ''kandil'' are switched on from sunset to dawn. As soon as the sun sets, a traditional "Ramadan Cannon" is fired from the highest hill in every city as a signal to start eating the iftar.

In [[Istanbul]], one of the more notable places to celebrate the iftar dinner is the Sultanahmet Square. Located near the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (Blue Mosque) the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Sultanahmet Square]] hosts many activities, including mini restaurants opened during the month of Ramadan, special shows, and traditional Ottoman theatrical shows.

The [[Tarawih]] prayer is mostly practised in Turkish mosques as 20 rekahs, broken into 5 groups of 4 rekahs. Between each set of 4 rekahs, a hymn composed by the Turkish musician [[Buhurizade Itri]] is sung by all people attending the prayer. The hymn is a prayer to praise the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]].

As Ramadan is also the month of [[Zakat|almsgiving]], many people organise iftar dinners for the poor, students, guests, and foreigners. People can find Turkish food available in most mosques.

During Ramadan, Turkish [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] like the Journalists and Writers Foundation have recently started to organise Interfaith Dialogue Dinners to promote dialogue between those of different religious and cultural backgrounds. These high-profile events have started a whole new era of organising large dinner parties by the NGOs in Turkey for people from different cultures and understandings even if they are not Muslims. In recent years Turkish NGOs, such as the [[Peace Islands Institute]] (former Interfaith Dialog Center), all over the world have organised iftar dinners for [[Cross-cultural communication|inter-cultural]] and [[interfaith]] dialogue, which helps promote the true understanding of the month of Ramadan.

=== United States and Canada ===

Iftar meals in the United States and Canada are often held at mosques, households, and Islamic community centres.

On 9 December 1805, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] postponed dinner at the [[White House]] until sunset to accommodate an envoy from [[Tunis]], an event considered by many to be the first White House iftar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/inbrief/2011/07/20110729153019kram0.3508199.html |title=Thomas Jefferson's Iftar |date=29 July 2011 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official iftar was held at the White House in 1996, hosted by First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]], and iftar meals were subsequently held annually at the [[White House]] and hosted by the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] and the [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] until 2016. President [[Donald Trump]] did not host an iftar dinner at the White House in 2017, his first year in office, but resumed the tradition on June 6, 2018, hosting friends and diplomatic staff of Muslim majority nations including Iraq, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Since 1996, the [[United States Department of State]] held an annual iftar dinner for local and national community leaders and faith groups as well as foreign policy officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/09/129232.htm Remarks at the Annual State Department Iftaar Dinner&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] Hillary Clinton: "Actually, we started in 1996 and held the first Ramadan Eid celebration at the White House."&lt;/ref&gt; This practice ceased in 2017, when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declined to host an iftar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torbati|first1=Yeganeh|title=Tillerson declines to host Ramadam event at State Department|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-religion-ramadan-usa-tillerson-exclsu-idUSKBN18M2IE|accessdate=10 June 2017|agency=Reuters|date=29 May 2017|ref=Tillerson Iftar Decline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pentagon continues its tradition of holding an iftar for Muslim members of the U.S. armed forces and special guests from other nations; the first iftar under the Trump Administration was held on 15 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://theintercept.com/2017/05/30/pentagon-will-be-hosting-a-ramadan-iftar-dinner-this-year-but-white-house-and-state-are-awol/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The occasion has also been marked in [[Judaism in the United States|Jewish]] [[synagogue]]s. In 2012, Iftar was recognized with events at three synagogues in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Jewish Councils on Urban Affairs |url=http://www.jcua.org/iftar-in-the-synagogue |title=Iftar in the Synagogue |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] extended an invitation to Muslim leaders to break the Ramadan Fast with him at the Prime Minister’s residence in 2015. This is the first time the Prime Minister’s office has hosted an iftar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/06/22/harper-invites-muslim-lea_n_7641480.html|title=Harper Invites Muslim Leaders To Break Fast With Him At 24 Sussex|date= 22 June 2015| accessdate= 14 December 2017|work=[[Huffington Post]]|via=[[The Canadian Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irreligion in [[Croatia]]''' refers in its narrowest sense to [[agnosticism]], [[atheism]], [[secular humanism]], and general [[secularism]]
of at least 300.000 non-religious Croatian citizens. Increase of the number of irreligious people is usually interpreted by the [[Modernization theory|modernization]] marked with tendency of secularization and the progress of science and technology that directly affect human society.

Although 2011 census showed that 4,57% of Croatian citizens considered themselves irreligious, [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] polls conducted in 2007 and 2008 found that 30.5% of respondents do not consider religion important in their lives, responding negatively to the question "Does religion has an important place in your life?"

Japanese research center [[Dentsu]] conducted survey in 2006 and concluded that 13.2% of the Croatian population declare themselves as irreligious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/~honkawa/9460.html |title=図録▽世界各国の宗教 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurobarometer]] survey conducted in 2010 questioned the religiosity in European countries on the basis of personal beliefs that "God exists", that "there is some sort of spirit or life force" and that "there is no sort of spirit, God or life force". 69% of respondents stated that they believed that God existed, 22% believed that there was some sort of spirit or life force, while 7% believed that there was none of the above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215001129/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidences suggests that irreligion is the fastest growing religious status in Croatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protagora.hr/Iz-medija-clanak/Nevjernici-u-Hrvatskoj-u-porastu/277/ |title=Nevjernici u Hrvatskoj u porastu – Protagora |publisher=Protagora.hr |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Number of agnostics and skeptics rose more than 20 times in the last ten years, while the number of atheists almost doubled. Increase of the number of agnostics in Croatia is usually explained by the fact that many public figures, such as President [[Ivo Josipović]], more often declare themselves as agnostics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-alter.org/vijesti/obrazovanje-je-glavni-neprijatelj-crkve |title=Obrazovanje je glavni neprijatelj Crkve - H-Alter - Udruga za medijsku kulturu |publisher=H-Alter |date= |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several organisations that promote irreligious or oppose religious belief, such as Protagora, David, Glas razuma - Pokret za sekularnu Hrvatsku, Nisam vjernik, were founded in the last decade. They organised several public actions such as the "Conference of reason" and campaign "Without god, without a master". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Piše: srijeda, 16.1.2013. 20:24 |url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/skup-razuma-necemo-sutke-promatrati-kako-crkva-pruza-pipke-i-odvlaci-drustvo-u-srednji-vijek/657462.aspx |title=Skup razuma: "Nećemo šutke promatrati kako Crkva pruža pipke i odvlači društvo u srednji vijek" - Vijesti |publisher=Index.hr |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography==
2011 census revealed that there were 32,518 agnostics and skeptics and 163,375 atheists in Croatia. Slightly more than 93,000 refused to answer on question about their religion. In addition, religion is unknown for 12,460 citizens. Highest percentage of irreligious people in Croatia was recorded in [[Zagreb]] (11.56%). [[Istria County|Istria]], [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County|Primorje-Gorski Kotar]] and [[Split-Dalmatia County|Split-Dalmatia]] are the only counties in which the number of irreligious people exceed 30.000. Looking at the relative share in the population by county, the highest number of irreligious people live in the northwest Croatia, namely in Istria (15.88%) and Primorje-Gorski Kotar (12.11%) counties and the City of Zagreb (11.56%). These three are the only counties where the proportion of irreligious people in the total population exceeds 10%.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/xls/Grad_03_HR.xls&lt;/ref&gt;

Locally, the largest share of irreligious people in Croatia is in [[Medulin]] municipality (23.51%), and from the cities, in [[Pula]] (23.01%). Town of [[Rovinj]] is the only town which has more than 20% of the irreligious people in addition to two Zagreb neighborhoods - [[Donji grad (Zagreb)|Donji grad]] and 
[[Gornji Grad–Medveščak]]. In the first 20 Croatian municipalities and cities with the highest proportions of irreligious population are mostly Istrian cities and municipalities of Istria and Primorje-Gorski Kotar counties, then central neighborhoods of Zagreb and the cities of [[Rijeka]] and [[Vis (town)|Vis]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Considering each county individually, it can be seen that the largest share of irreligious population generally lives in towns in several counties, often county seats. 

On the other hand, Dalmatian municipalities [[Kijevo, Croatia|Kijevo]] and [[Lokvičići]] have no irreligious residents. In 20 local administrative units with the lowest percentage of irreligious population (less than 0.33%), mostly are municipalities in southwestern and eastern Croatian counties, and the only city among them is the City of [[Otok, Vukovar-Srijem County|Otok]] in Vukovar-Srijem County with 0.28% of irreligious population.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Table==
Based on official data from the 2001 and 2011 censuses, following data on the distribution of religious and irreligious  population in Croatia can be ascertained.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H01_02_04/H01_02_04.html |title=SAS Output |publisher=Dzs.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Researches on irreligion==
Scientific researches of irreligion in Croatia are generally scarce,&lt;ref name="academia1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2416816/Vjera_u_obrazovanje_i_obrazovanje_u_vjeri._Stavovi_i_iskustva_nereligioznih_roditelja_prema_religiji_i_vjeronauku_u_javnim_%C5%A1kolama_u_Republici_Hrvatskoj |title=Vjera u obrazovanje i obrazovanje u vjeri. Stavovi i iskustva nereligioznih roditelja prema religiji i vjeronauku u javnim školama u Republici Hrvatskoj &amp;#124; Branko Ančić |publisher=Academia.edu |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is not possible to know which and what are the differences between religious and irreligious population in for example work on public projects that are important to the community, membership in voluntary associations, going to public meetings, voting in local elections, attending protest demonstrations and political rallies, donating time and money to certain purposes including secular, etc. In addition, it is not researched nor how society perceives irreligious people as one of its component parts, what is their position in society, etc.

International longitudinal research ''Aufbruch'' conducted in 1997 in ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe revealed that in Croatia, 31.5% of respondents considered themselves very religious, 42.6% somewhat religious, while the remaining 26% said either that they are not religious, or that they are somewhat or completely irreligious.&lt;ref name="academia1"/&gt; On the question which examined the image of God, 25.6% of respondents said they sometimes do not believe in God or do not believe in him at all.

International research [[International Social Survey Programme|ISSP]] that was conducted in 2008, explored the socio-demographic and religious characteristics of religious and irreligious people. Researches concluded that the level of education negatively correlated with the degree of religiosity, and that irreligious people largely live in the cities than in the countryside, while this difference is less pronounced with religious people.&lt;ref name="academia1"/&gt; 

In a research of attitudes of irreligious people towards religion and faith, it was revealed that all respondents differentiate religion and faith, and some church and religion. Attitudes toward religion vary from nothing positive to positive. Among the critics of religion, respondents usually cited control and deceive of the masses, financial interest action, fundamentalism arising from religion, aggressive intrusion into the social sphere, the separation of people and imposing one value system as the only correct one, while those who expressed a positive attitude emphasized that religion plays an important role in society and history.&lt;ref name="academia1"/&gt; 

==Irreligion in politics==
Although the connection between religious and political preferences was not examined, in five out of six [[President of Croatia|presidential elections]], Croatian voters elected presidents who declared themselves as irreligious or agnostics. [[Ivica Račan]], 7th Prime Minister, [[Zoran Milanović]], 10th Prime Minister,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pongračić/CROPIX |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/milanovic-krsten-sam-i-ozenjen-u-crkvi-ali-vjernik-nisam.-kao-i-svaki-covjek-tragam-za-smislom/2051835/ |title=Milanović: Kršten sam i oženjen u crkvi, ali vjernik nisam.

[[File:Quba-Mosque Windhoek Namibia.jpg|thumb|''Quba Mosque'' in Windhoek]]
'''Namibia''' is home to a small but growing Muslim community.

==Number of Muslims==
While in 2009 insiders estimated the number of Muslims to be between 3,000 and 5,000 people,&lt;ref name=IPS/&gt; in 2011 it was estimated to be  9,000 Muslims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/|title=Table: Muslim Population by Country|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom are Nama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=18129|title=Islam in Namibia, making an impact|publisher=Islamonline.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Islam]] along with [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and the [[Baha'i Faith]], which make up the largest minority religions in [[Namibia]], but combined account for less than 1% of the population of Namibia.

==Growth of Namibia's Muslim community==
Most of Namibia's Muslim community are members of the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] ethnic group.&lt;ref name=IOL&gt;[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2006-06/01/02.shtml IslamOnline.net- News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that this is mostly as a result of the efforts of a prominent politician among the Nama, [[Jacobs Salmaan Dhameer]], who converted to [[Islam]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="IOL"/&gt; The first [[mosque]] in the country, the ''Soweto Islamic Centre'', was established 1986 and is located in [[Katutura]]. As of May 2009, there were twelve mosques in the country, six in [[Windhoek]], two in [[Katima Mulilo]], one in [[Walvis Bay]], and three in the north of the country in the former [[Ovamboland]].&lt;ref name=IPS&gt;Nathalie Rosa Bucher (12 May 2009): [http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/05/religion-namibia-finding-sanctuary-in-islam/ Finding Sanctuary in Islam] ''[[Inter Press Service News Agency]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Namibia Islamic Judicial Council'' is based on [[Ondobe]] in the [[Ohangwena Region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijcnam.org ijcnam.org]&lt;/ref&gt; NIHA (Namibia Islamic Halaal Association) is Namibia's oldest and most well known Halaal Certifying body, recognised by the Halaal Certification body in South Africa and in many Islamic states. NIHA was established in 2001 and before known as the ''Namibia Halaal Slaughterers Association''. It certifies food outlets in the country.

'''[[Islam]]''' is a minority religion in the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. There are about 2,500 Muslims in the Islands,&lt;ref name=alukah&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alukah.net/world_muslims/0/72528/ |title=الأقلية المسلمة في منطقة البحر الكاريبي

Prince '''Ivan Sergeyevich Gagarin''' (Иван Сергеевич Гагарин; born in Moscow, 1 August 1814; died in Paris, 19 July 1882) was a [[Russia]]n [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], known also as ''Jean-Xavier'' after his [[Religious conversion|conversion]] from [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. He was of the [[Gagarin family]], which traces its origin to the medieval rulers of [[Starodub-on-the-Klyazma]]. He was the founding editor of ''[[Études (journal)|Études]]''.

==Life==
He was the son of the Russian state-councillor, Prince Sergey Gagarin, and Varvara Pushkina. He entered the service of the state at an early age, and was first named attaché to his uncle, Prince Gregory Gagarin, at Munich, on whose death, in 1837, he acted as secretary to the legation at [[Vienna]]. He was afterwards transferred to the Russian embassy at Paris, where his services were requisitioned in a similar capacity.

He frequented the salon of his near relation, Madame [[Sophie Swetchine]], and was on terms of familiar intercourse with Father de [[Ravignan]], [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire|Lacordaire's]] successor in the pulpit of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].

His [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Catholicism took place in 1842. On 19 April of that year Gagarin made his [[profession of faith]], and was received into the [[Catholic Church]] by Ravignan. According to Russian law, this put an end to his diplomatic career, and he forfeited all rights to his inheritance.

In the latter half of 1843 he entered the [[Society of Jesus]], and passed his [[novitiate]] at [[College of Saint-Acheul|Saint-Acheul]]. He was afterwards sent to [[Brugelette]] (in [[Belgium]]) where the French Jesuits in exile had a High School. He then taught church history and philosophy, at the [[College of Vaugirard]] and the school of [[Ste-Geneviève]], and at [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]]. He spent some time in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] and, in 1855, was back at Paris. From this time onwards he wrote extensively in the Catholic cause.

When the religious orders were expelled from France, Gagarin went to Switzerland, but soon returned to Paris, where he died.

==Works==
Gagarin's literary output was considerable; many of his articles which appeared in current reviews and periodicals were afterwards collected and published in book form.

As a polemist Gagarin was thorough, and his work as a religious propagandist was of importance. His main object was win over Russia to the Catholic Church. In conjunction with Fr. Daniel, Gagarin founded (1856) the journal "Etudes de théologie, de philosophie et d'histoire" (merged into "Etudes religieuses, historiques et littéraires", 1862);&lt;ref&gt;The Journal is still extant under the name of ''[http://www.revue-etudes.com/ Études]'' and is published monthly from Paris&lt;/ref&gt; he established the "Œuvre de Prop. des Sts. Cyrille et Méthode" (1858), to promote corporate union amongst the Churches; and contributed to the "Contemporain", "Univers", "Ami de la Religion", "Précis historiques", "Correspondant", "Revue des questions historiques", etc.

The "Polybiblion" (Paris, 1882), another review in which articles appeared from the pen of Gagarin, exhibits (XXXV, 166-188) a long list of his writings. These include: 
*"La question religieuse dans l'Orient" (1854);

Gagarin also spent several years in [[Constantinople]], where he founded the Society of St. Dionysius the Areopagite, which aimed at reuniting the Greek and Latin Churches. With this object, too, he published:

*"L'Eglise roumaine", etc. (1865);
*"Constitution et situation présente de toutes les Eglises de l'Orient" (Paris, 1865);
*"Les Eglises orientales unies" (1867),

studies on the Oriental Churches. Amongst works of Gagarin's later years are:

*"Les hymnes de l'Eglise russe" (1868);
*the discursive "Le Clergé Russe" (new ed. Brussels, 1871; tr. London, 1872), a collection, in book form, of a series of articles published in the "Etudes religieuses" under the title "La réforme du clergé russe", an indictment of the encroachments of civil aggression on ecclesiastical right;
*"Mémoires d'Archetti" [Paris, Brussels, 1872 - "Les Jésuites de Russie" (1783–1785)];
*and "Religion et Mœurs des Russes", edited by Gagarin (Paris, 1879).

Almost all the above were published at Paris. A portion of his works were re-issued by Brühl, in "Russische Studien zur Theologie und Geschichte" (Münster, 1857); and by Huttler, in "Katholike Studien" (Augsburg, 1865).

'''Jehovah Wanyonyi''' (1924 – 18 July 2015) was a self-proclaimed god who lived in Chemororoch village in [[Uasin Gishu County]], western [[Kenya]]. He claimed to be the Almighty God and deemed [[Jesus Christ]] to be his son. He considered [[Mount Elgon]] which is near his home to be [[Mount Zion]]. He died on July 18, 2015 at the age of 91.&lt;ref name=godjesus&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/thecounties/article/2000172273/self-proclaimed-god-jehovah-wanyonyi-is-dead|title=Self-proclaimed god Jehovah Wanyonyi is dead|publisher=''[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]''|date=August 10, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also claimed to be able to cure [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]], and had stated that he would punish [[Kenya]] if the country did not give him 3 billion [[Kenyan shilling]]s ($34.6 million). He referred to his ministry as the Lost Isralites of Kenya.

Wanyonyi had 70 wives and 95 children.&lt;ref name=godjesus/&gt; He had several grandchildren. He refused to say if his children are also sons of God. Wanyonyi is said to have approximately 1,000 followers who consider him to be God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apologeticsindex.org/news1/an011113-13.html Kenyan 'God' sent Aids as 'punishment'] Apologetics Index&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his first on-screen appearance during the episode airing on 6 May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/qtoz/JohnStape/default.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011041205/http://www.itv.com/Soaps/coronationstreet/castandcharacters/qtoz/JohnStape/default.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 October 2007 |title=Coronation Street - Cast &amp; Characters - Q-Z Cast &amp; Characters - John Stape |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |date=July 2007 |accessdate=26 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The character departed on 3 June 2011 after four years on the show.

The character has been at the centre of some major storylines such as the kidnap of local teenager [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), covering up [[Colin Fishwick]]'s ([[David Crellin]]) death from a heart attack, the manslaughter of [[Joy Fishwick]] ([[Doreen Mantle]]) and the murder of [[Charlotte Hoyle]] ([[Becky Hindley]]). The character was married to [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) with whom he has a daughter called [[Hope Stape|Hope]]. John died in October 2011 after crashing his car into the back of a lorry, during a car chase with [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]).
The actor [[Graeme Hawley]] also appeared in 1998 as a policeman who questioned [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] about [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]]'s fall off the scaffolding.

==Storylines==
John is organising a school play rehearsal, when he encounters his former girlfriend, [[Fiz Brown]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]). John and Fiz begin dating. John starts tutoring [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]) in English Literature. He meets her teenage daughter, [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), and they begin a secret affair. The pair are almost caught together on several occasions and Fiz realises something is up with John. She wrongly accuses John and Sally of having an affair. John and Rosie's relationship is revealed on Christmas Day, after John mixes up Fiz and Rosie's presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Coronation Street|title=Corrie Christmas 2007: John's Been Having An Affair With Rosie - Coronation Street|date=2014-12-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wzvsOwCwfc|accessdate=2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; John is then attacked by [[Kevin Webster]] ([[Michael Le Vell]]). John is fired from his teaching job due to his relationship with Rosie. John gets a job at Street Cars and Fiz forgives him for cheating on her. John notices Rosie outside a nightclub one night and, blaming her for his misfortune, he kidnaps her. John locks Rosie in his grandmother's house for five weeks. Fiz comes to the house and finds Rosie, John is then arrested. He is sentenced to two years in prison.

Fiz learns John has been put on suicide watch, after being diagnosed with depression and she goes to visit him. John decides to give Rosie £150,000 from his inheritance as a form of compensation. Fiz asks John to marry her and he accepts. They are married in the prison with [[Chesney Brown]] ([[Sam Aston]]) and [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) as witnesses. John is later released from prison and moves in with Fiz. John is invited to his ex-colleague, [[Colin Fishwick]]'s ([[David Crellin]]), leaving party. Colin explains that he is emigrating to Canada and is leaving the teaching profession. After being sacked from his job at an adult education centre, John decides to take Colin's identity and use it to start teaching again. Fiz agrees to go along with his plan and they keep it a secret from Chesney. [[Charlotte Hoyle]] (Becky Hindley) discovers what John is doing and she starts emotionally blackmailing him. John learns Colin is moving to Canada because he was having an affair with a married woman. The woman's husband tracks down John, thinking he is Colin, and punches him. Fiz asks John to quit teaching and he agrees, but decides to continue with the deception in secret.

Colin returns unexpectedly and confronts John and Charlotte. During an argument, Colin collapses and dies of a brain hemorrhage. John and Charlotte dispose of Colin's body in a hole in the floor of the Underworld factory. Fiz learns John is still teaching and threatens to leave him. She later tells John she is pregnant and John promises never to lie to her again. John is pursued by a stalker, who turns out to be Charlotte. She continues to blackmail him and John worries when she introduces him as her fiancé to her parents, [[Dorothy Hoyle|Dorothy]] ([[Jean Fergusson]]) and [[Alan Hoyle (Coronation Street)|Alan]](Michael McStay). Colin's elderly mother, [[Joy Fishwick|Joy]] ([[Doreen Mantle]]) comes looking for her son, but John tells her Colin has gone to Canada. John tells Charlotte that he has no intention of leaving Fiz for her. Charlotte gets angry and reaches for a hammer and swings it at John. He manages to wrestle it from her hands and as Charlotte goes to leave, John hits her. Believing her to be dead, John starts to call an ambulance, but is distracted by the sound of an explosion. He leaves the house and discovers a tram has crashed onto the street. Fiz goes into labour early and John goes to the hospital with her. She gives birth to a girl, who John and Fiz name Hope.

John moves Charlotte's body out of the house and pretends to have found her in the wreckage of the tram. The paramedics find Charlotte's pulse and she is placed on a ventilator to help her breathe. However, John and her parents are told she will not regain consciousness due to heavy brain damage. They all decide to switch off the life support machine. John and Fiz worry for Hope when they learn she has a hole in her heart, which can be treated with medication. John begins visiting Joy and helping her with her shopping. John eventually confesses everything to Joy, who has an angina attack from the shock. Someone comes to the door and John panics and puts his hand over Joy's mouth to stop her screaming. Joy then dies and John leaves her house. John suffers a breakdown and is hospitalised. On his return, he holds his daughter for the first time and gets a job at the local betting shop. John stops taking his medication, but after learning Fiz has claimed Joy's inheritance fraudulently, he freaks out and barricades himself in his office. John disappears, but later returns and tells Fiz about how Charlotte was blackmailing him.

Chesney learns the truth about John's link to the Hoyle family and Dorothy realises John is not Colin. John takes all three of them hostage at the Hoyle's house. John tells Chesney's girlfriend [[Katy Armstrong]] ([[Georgia May Foote]]) that he has run away. John learns the factory floor is being dug up and he gets a job working for the local builder, [[Owen Armstrong]] ([[Ian Puleston-Davies]]). One night, John returns to the factory and digs up Colin's body. However, Fiz follows him and is horrified when John confesses that the body is Colin. Fiz reluctantly agrees to help dispose of the body in the canal. Fiz follows John to the Hoyle's house and finds Chesney, Dorothy and Alan tied up in the basement. The police are called and John flees. When Fiz refuses to run away with him, John takes Hope. John discovers Fiz was run over while she was chasing after him. He visits her in hospital and returns Hope to her. The police arrive and John jumps off the hospital roof and disappears.

A few months later, John returns to Weatherfield and kidnaps Rosie. John tells her he wants her to go to court and help Fiz, who has been arrested for the crimes he committed. John explains his version of events to Rosie and makes her recite them to him. Kevin and [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) eventually find John and Rosie and John takes off in his car. Kevin follows and John crashes his car. He is taken to the hospital and Fiz and Hope come to visit him. Fiz forgives John and tells him she loves him. John makes a statement to the police and then dies from his injuries.

==Development==
The character of John was created as a new love interest for established character Fiz Brown who was to split from her long term love interest [[Kirk Sutherland]] around whom most of her romance storylines were centred. It was shortly revealed thereafter that the character would feature in an affair plot with the character Rosie Webster, who was just over the legal age for sexual intercourse. The characteristics of John are a caring nature and the tendency to be charming to females. The actor said his character's personality and success with the female characters of the show is because of his charm: "He's a bit of a charmer and finds it easy to relax with them and be in their company. He has this disarming charm about him. He's a good listener and talks a lot. That's what they like about him, and he has this 'everyman' quality about him."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a112221/graeme-hawley-john-stape-corrie.html|title=Coronation Street - Interview - Graeme Hawley (John Stape, Corrie)|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Kris Green|date=22 July 2008|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has revealed himself to be an atheist.

In early 2008, it was announced that a big storyline for John was coming up involving him kidnapping [[Rosie Webster]]. "Rosie is in for a shock when ex-lover John Stape forces her into a car to get her away from her new man. The tearaway teen, played by Helen Flanagan, is out on a date when the ex-teacher forces her home. John, played by Graeme Hawley, had an affair with the young temptress while he was dating The Street's Fiz. She's upset by his behaviour," a soap insider tells The Sun. "Especially as she was just getting close to her new beau."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/tv-news/269317/see-photos-spoiler-alert-coronation-street-s-rosie-webster-dragged-home-by-ex-lover/1/ SEE PHOTOS SPOILER ALERT Coronation Street's Rosie Webster dragged home by ex-lover - CelebsNow&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, it was announced that John Stape is to conceal the body of his former friend Colin Fishwick in a forthcoming plotline, a report has claimed. The sinister storyline is thought to begin when Colin returns from Canada unexpectedly, throwing John's world into chaos because he has stolen his old acquaintance's identity to continue working as a teacher following his stint in jail. According to the [[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]], Colin ends up dead after clashing with John, prompting the ex-convict to hide his corpse in Underworld, where renovation work is being carried out in the aftermath of [[Tony Gordon]]'s siege explosion. Builders working at the factory go on to pour concrete over the spot where Colin is buried, leaving John - played by 36-year-old Graeme Hawley - to think he is in the clear. However, John's friend [[Charlotte Hoyle]] (Becky Hindley) is also involved in Colin's death and panics over the situation, claiming that the truth is "bound to come out". Meanwhile, another possible stumbling block for the teacher comes when factory boss [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) spots him on the building site shortly after the concrete is spread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a223487/dark-plot-ahead-for-corries-john-stape.html Dark plot ahead for Corrie's John Stape&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, it was announced that the conclusion to John Stape's storyline would see the character commit suicide. Fearing that Colin's remains will be uncovered, John  decides to end his nightmare by taking his own life.

In August 2011, it was announced Hawley would be returning to ''Coronation Street'' in October for a short stint.&lt;ref name="KidnapHorror"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a333504/coronation-street-rosie-to-face-new-kidnap-horror.html|title='Coronation Street' Rosie 'to face new kidnap horror'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=5 August 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, John kidnaps Rosie Webster and tries to clear Fiz's name by confessing to the murders of Colin, Charlotte and Joy.&lt;ref name="KidnapHorror"/&gt; His return aired from 21 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/spoilers/a344611/amber-makes-a-move-on-sophie.html|title=Amber makes a move on Sophie|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=11 October 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
John was nominated in the category of "Villain of the Year" at the 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/british-soap-awards-2009/news/british-soap-awards-2009-nominations-revealed/5671|title=British Soap Awards 2009: Nominations revealed!|date=5 May 2009|work=[[What's on TV]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|accessdate=15 March 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011 [[British Soap Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a307476/british-soap-awards-2011-voting-opens.html|title=British Soap Awards 2011 voting opens|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=7 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=2011-03-07&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x0jSLWib?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a307476/british-soap-awards-2011-voting-opens.html|archivedate=7 March 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the viewing public became annoyed at one of the character's main storylines. Actor [[Graeme Hawley]] was blasted for his portrayal of the character stating that he gave the teaching profession a bad name. Hawley explained that: "I have bumped into a few teachers who haven't been happy with me," Graeme told the Daily Record. "They say, 'You know, we are not all like that.' And my answer to that is, 'I know at least three teachers who had affairs with their students when I was at school. You might not have done it, but don't tell me it doesn't happen.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a124260/corrie-character-stape-upsets-teachers.html|title=Soaps - News - Corrie character Stape upsets teachers|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|author=Daniel Kilkelly|date=19 August 2008|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actor was asked if he was heckled a lot in real life by the viewing public during an interview with British Entertainment and Media website [[Digitalspy]] on which Graeme had to say: "There's been a lot of friendly banter really. It happens a lot in the street wherever I go. It's all good-natured, though. People are very complimentary about the storyline and character and asking when John was returning, so that's been lovely. It was nice to hear that people wanted to see more of John Stape back on the Cobbles."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

== Biography ==
Bediako was born in [[Akropong]], [[Ghana]] and, as the son of a police inspector, grew up in a Police Training Depot in [[Accra]]. Due to this upbringing, he learned and spoke his mother tongue of [[Twi]] and the Accra language [[Ga language|Ga]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dacb.org/stories/ghana/bediako-kwame/|title=Bediako, Kwame|last=Walls|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Walls|date=2008|website=Dictionary of African Christian Biography|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926190751/https://dacb.org/stories/ghana/bediako-kwame/|archive-date=2017-09-26|dead-url=no|access-date=26 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bediako was raised in a Christian home, the grandson of a Presbyterian catechist and evangelist, and received his secondary education in the [[Mfantsipim School|Mfantsi-pim School]], [[Cape Coast]], originally founded as part of a [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|British Methodist]] mission. However, he would later become an atheist through [[Existentialism|French existentialist]] influences and pursue masters and doctoral degrees in the [[University of Bordeaux]] on African francophone literature. Yet during his time in France, he experienced a radical conversion event back to Christianity. In 1973, he would marry a fellow student of French, from England, Gillian Mary. Later, he would move on to a second doctorate in 1983 in the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Aberdeen]], under [[Andrew Walls]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Bediako would later become the first rector of the Akrofi-Christaller Institute for Theology, Mission and Culture, a university dedicated to the study and the documentation of Christian history, thought, and life in Ghana and, more broadly, in Africa. An [[Financial endowment|endowment fund]] has been established in the Institute under his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acighana.org/site/kbefund/index.php|title=Kwame Bediako Endowment Fund|last=|first=|date=|website=Akrofi-Christaller Institute of Theology, Mission and Culture|language=EN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909165612/http://www.acighana.org/site/kbefund/index.php|archive-date=2017-09-09|dead-url=no|access-date=26 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kwame Bediako died on June 10, 2008 following a serious illness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zondervan.typepad.com/zondervan/2008/06/kwame-bediako.html|title=Dr. Kwame Bediako In Memory - Zondervan Blog|last=Wright|first=Christopher J.

== Theology ==
In his latter life, Bediako was known primarily for his works in [[African theology|African Christian theology]].

His PhD at Aberdeen would be later published in 1999, which explored the influence of indigenous cultures on Christianity in the second century Greco-Roman world and in 20th century Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lKbOrK-E6nwC|title=Theology and Identity: The Impact of Culture Upon Christian Thought in the Second Century and in Modern Africa|last=Bediako|first=Kwame|publisher=OCMS|year=1999|isbn=978-1-870345-10-1|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other works have tended to emphasize questions related to the encounter between Christianity and an indigenous religious context, especially as found in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mb3YAAAAMAAJ|title=Christianity in Africa: The Renewal of a Non-Western Religion|last=Bediako|first=Kwame|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-7486-0625-2|location=Edinburgh|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, mindful of his linguistic background, Bediako was an advocate for the role of [[Vernacular|vernacular language]] on the development of Christian theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bediako|first=Kwame|date=|title=The Doctrine of Christ and the Significance of Vernacular Terminology|url=http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1998-03/1998-03-110-bediako.pdf|journal=International Bulletin of Missionary Research|publication-date=July 1998|volume=22|issue=3|pages=110–111|via=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926143943/http://www.internationalbulletin.org/issues/1998-03/1998-03-110-bediako.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Li Shaojun''' (李少君, fl. 133 BCE) was a ''[[fangshi]]'' (master of esoterica), reputed ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' (transcendent; immortal), [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Emperor Wu of Han]], and the earliest known [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemist]]. In the early history of Chinese ''[[waidan]]'' (External Alchemy), Li is the only ''fangshi'' whose role is documented by both historical (for instance, ''[[Shiji]]'') and alchemical (''[[Baopuzi]]'') sources. 

==Shiji==
The earliest record of Li Shaojun was contemporaneously written during the reign of his patron Emperor Wu (141-87 BCE): [[Sima Qian]]'s c. 94 BCE ''[[Shiji]]'' (Records of the Historian) has nearly identical versions in the "Annals of Emperor Wu" (chapter 6) and "The Treatise on the Feng and Shan Sacrifices" (28, tr. Watson 1961: 3-52). In addition, the c. 111 CE ''[[Hanshu]]'' "Book of Han" (25A) has a "closely parallel" version (Campany 2006: 325).
[[File:漢武帝.jpg|thumb|Emperor Wu of Han]]

The ''Shiji'' chronicles Li Shaojun as part of a lengthy debate on whether and how Emperor Wu should perform the ''Feng'' (封) and ''Shan'' (禪) state rituals on [[Mount Tai]] in honor of Heaven and Earth. Debaters were divided between two factions, the ''fangshi'' maintained that Wu should emulate the [[Yellow Emperor]], their main deity, who obtained immortality through performing the rituals, while the Confucianist court officials such as [[Gongsun Hong]] suggested that the emperor should only express gratitude to Heaven and Earth (Pregadio 2006: 30).

The ''Liji'' narrative about Li Shaojun begins with his intentionally obscure origins and introduction to Emperor Wu, to whom he recommends ''cizao'' (祠灶, sacrifice to the furnace/stove) and ''gudao'' (穀道, the Way of [avoiding] grains, aka ''[[bigu]]'' 辟穀, Daoist grain avoidance) as methods to attain longevity/immortality. Li does not name which furnace gods to worship, but the Stove God [[Kitchen God|Zaoshen]] is traditionally associated both with alchemy and ''bigu'', in Chinese [[The Raw and the Cooked|raw/cooked]] logic, since cereal grains were cooked on the stove.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was at this time also that Li Shaojun appeared before the emperor to expound the worship of the god of the fireplace and explain his theories on how to achieve immortality through dietary restrictions [祠灶穀道卻老方見]. The emperor treated him with great respect. Li Shaojun had formerly been a retainer of the marquis of [[Shenze County|Shenze]] and specialized in magical arts [主方]. He kept his real age and place of birth a secret, always telling people that he was seventy years old. Claiming that he could make the spirits serve him and prevent old age [能使物卻老], he travelled about to the courts of the various feudal lords, expounding his magic. He had no wife or children. When people heard of his power to command the spirits and drive away death [使物及不死] they showered him with a constant stream of presents, so that he always had more than enough food and clothing and money. Impressed that he seemed to enjoy such affluence without engaging in any business, and also not knowing where he was from, people put even greater faith in his claims and vied with each other in waiting on him. He relied wholly on his ability to work magic and was clever at making pronouncements that were later found to have been curiously apt [資好方善為巧發奇中]. (tr. Watson 1961: 25) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare alternate translations of "art of making offerings to the (spirit of the) Furnace (i.e. carrying on alchemical practices), and knew how to live without (eating) cereals and without growing old" (Needham 1976: 29), and "method of worshipping the furnace and abstaining from cereals to prevent old age" (tr. Despeux 2008:233). 
[[Burton Watson]] translates ''shiwu'' (使物) as " make the spirits serve him" and "command the spirits", interpreting ''wu'' (物, thing, matter, phenomenon) as ''guiwu'' (鬼物, ghosts; spirits; divine beings); [[Joseph Needham]] translates "using natural substances to bring about perpetual youth", interpreting ''wu'' as ''yaowu'' (藥物, medicines; drugs) (1976: 29).

Some commentators and most translators take wu here to mean ''guiwu'', ghosts and spirits, but we follow those who interpret it as ''yaowu'', chemical substances and drugs.
''wu'' (物, thing, matter, phenomenon), interpreted as ''guiwu'' (鬼物, ghosts; spirits; divine beings),

Since Li intentionally kept his birthplace and age secret, little is certain about his life, even his name is a [[pseudonym]]: Li the Youthful Lord (Campany 2009: 117). [[Li (surname 李)|Li]] (李, plum) is a very common [[Chinese surname]] and Shaojun (少君, Youthful Lord) is a [[courtesy name]]—also used by Dou Shaojun (竇少君) or Dou Guangguo (竇廣國, d. 151 BCE), the younger brother of [[Empress Dou (Wen)|Empress Dou]]. Compare the 2nd-century BCE ''fangshi'' spiritualist mentioned below, Li Shaoweng (李少翁, Li the Youthful Old Man) (Campany 2002: 225).
The ''Shiji'' context continues with two "self-authenticating" (Campany 2009: 146) stories about Li Shaojunbeing able to recall incidents of the distant past (Loewe 2000: 227). The former describes him at a party given by [[Empress Wang Zhi]]'s half-brother Tian Fen (田蚡, d. 131 BCE), who was enfeoffed as the Marquis of [[Wu'an]] in 141 BCE.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Once when he was staying with Tian Fen, the marquis of Wu'an, and was drinking with the marquis and his friends, he told one of the guests, an old man of over ninety, that he had gone with the man's grandfather to such and such a place to practise archery. The old man had in fact, when he was a child, accompanied his grandfather, and remembered visiting the place that Li Shaojun mentioned. With this the whole party was struck with amazement. (tr. Watson 1961: 25) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The latter story narrates how Li recognized a [[Chinese ritual bronzes|ritual bronze]] that belonged to [[Duke Huan of Qi]] (r. 685-643 BCE).
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Li Shaojun appeared before the emperor, the latter questioned him about an ancient bronze vessel which the emperor had in his possession. "This vessel," replied Li Shaojun, "was presented at the Cypress Chamber in the tenth year of the reign of Duke Huan of Qi (676 BC)." When the inscription on the vessel was deciphered, it was found that it had in fact belonged to Duke Huan of Qi. Everyone in the place was filled with astonishment and decided that Li Shaojun must be a spirit who had lived hundreds of years. (Watson 1961: 25-26) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Emperor Wu was convinced that Li Shaojun could prevent the onset of old age and achieve deathlessness,

Next, the ''Shiji'' relates the emperor undertaking Li's convoluted, long-term alchemical project for achieving immortality through the same method as the Yellow Emperor (Pregadio 2006: 29-30). The alchemical process began with ''cizao'' (sacrificing to the furnace) in order to summon ''wu'' (物, thing; matter; phenomenon), interpreted again as ''guiwu'' (鬼物, ghosts; spirits; divine beings), who would transmute [[cinnabar]] into gold, which would gradually extend the emperor’s life long enough to meet the ''xian'' of [[Mount Penglai|Penglai Island]], and thus learn to correctly perform the ''feng'' and ''shan'' ceremonies. Li Shaojun authenticates his plan by describing his own meeting with the legendary immortal [[Anqi Sheng]] on Penglai. Needham literally interprets ''wu'' as natural substances or phenomena and not spiritual beings, and translates ''zhiwu'' (致物)– as "natural substances can be caused to change" or "natural phenomena can be caused to happen" (1976: 29).
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Shaojun then advised the emperor, "If you sacrifice to the fireplace you can call the spirits to you, and if the spirits come you can transform cinnabar into gold [祠灶則致物致物而丹沙可化為黃金]. Using this gold, you may make drinking and eating vessels, which will prolong the years of your life. With prolonged life you may visit the immortals who live on the island of Penglai in the middle of the sea. If you visit them and perform the Feng and Shan sacrifices, you will never die. This is what the Yellow Emperor did. Once I wandered by the sea and visited Master Anqi, and he fed me jujubes as big as melons. Master Anqi is an immortal who roams about Penglai. If he takes a liking to someone he will come to meet him, but if not he will hide." As a result, the emperor for the first time began to sacrifice in person to the fireplace. He dispatched magicians to set out on the sea in search of Master Anqi and the immortals of Penglai and attempted to make gold out of cinnabar sand and various kinds of medicinal ingredients. (tr. Watson 1961: 26) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The statement that Master Anqi will sometimes hide, "accomplishes four things at once: it confirms Li’s own exalted status—for the clear implication is that Li has been deemed worthy of approach by An Qi; it portrays as restricted access to the sources of such methods as Li prescribes; it establishes a precedent for the contemporary adept’s withholding of esoterica from the unworthy; and it acts as a failsafe lest the emperor practice the method unsuccessfully." (Campany 2006: 325)

Li Shaojun’s method shows that rituals were associated with Chinese alchemy since its earliest recorded beginnings. The Daoist [[Waidan#First texts|Taiqing]] (太清, Great Clarity) tradition likewise summoned gods and other supernatural beings while making elixirs (Pregadio 2006: 32). However, in contrast to later practices of ''[[waidan]]'' External Alchemy. Li’s alchemical gold did not grant immortality, but only longevity, and his technique did not involve ingesting it but casting it into dishes and cups. This uncommon use of alchemical gold was mentioned in texts like the ''Jinye jing'' (金液經, Scripture of the Golden Fluid) (Pregadio 2006: 30). This episode represents the first instance of imperial patronage of ''[[waidan]]'' practices, which continued during the [[Six Dynasties]] and intensified in the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] period (Pregadio 2008: 643). 

The ''Shiji'' narrative concludes with Li Shaojun's reported death, or perhaps his simulated ''[[Shijie (Daoism)|shijie]]'' escape from the corpse, and the aftermath.
&lt;blockquote&gt;After some time, Li Shaojun fell ill and died [病死]. The emperor, however, believed that he was not really dead but had transformed himself into a spirit [化去不死], and he ordered Kuan Shu [寬舒], a clerk from Huangchui [黃錘], to carry on the magical arts which Li Shaojun had taught. None of the group sent out to search for Master Anqi in the island of Penglai succeeded in finding anything. After this, any number of strange and dubious magicians [怪迂之方士] from the seacoast of Yan and Qi appeared at court to speak to the emperor about supernatural affairs. (tr. Watson 1961: 26) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''Shiji'' passage about Emperor Wu and Li Shaojun, the earliest historically reliable document, is "surprisingly dense, relating as it does waidan to mythology, hagiography, ritual, and even state ceremonies." It is unclear whether Li's elaborate method represented a long but undocumented tradition before him or simply reflects his attempt at picking as many features as possible that would capture the emperor’s interest and combining them into a secret "alchemical recipe" (Pregadio 2006: 31).

==Lunheng==
The skeptical philosopher and author [[Wang Chong]]'s c. 80 CE ''[[Lunheng]]'' (Balanced Discourses) repeatedly mentions Li Shaojun in the ''Daoxu'' (道虛, Daoist Untruths) chapter to demonstrate that while some individuals have had very long lives, no one has ever become a Daoist ''xian'' immortal. Wang's narrative generally follows the ''Shiji'' biography of Li Shaojun but adds some reasons to doubt its veracity.

The ''Lunheng'' narrative of Li's introduction to Emperor Wu has some different vocabulary than the ''Shiji'', for instance, writing ''cizao'' (sacrifice to the furnace/stove) with the [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] ''zao'' (竈) in place of ''zao'' (灶) and using the common name ''bigu'' (辟穀, grain avoidance) instead of ''gudao'' (穀道, the Way of [avoiding] grains).
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the time of Han Wu Ti there lived a certain Li Shao Chün, who pretended that by sacrificing to the "Hearth" and abstaining from eating grain he could ward off old age [以祠竈辟穀卻老方見上]. He saw the emperor, who conferred high honours upon him. Li Shao Chün kept his age and the place where he was born and had grown up secret, always saying that he was seventy old, and could effect that things did not grow old. On his journeys he visited all the princes around and was not married. On hearing that he could manage that things did not age, people presented him with much richer gifts than they would otherwise have done. He had always money, gold, dresses, and food in abundance. As people believed that he did not do any business, and was yet richly provided with everything, and as nobody knew, what sort of a man he really was, there was a general competition in offering him services. (tr. Forke 1907: 343-344) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Lunheng'' makes some minor changes in the two stories indicating that Li Shaojun was hundreds of years old. First, when Li meets the nonagenarian at the Marquis of Wu'an's party, instead of "The old man had in fact, when he was a child, accompanied his grandfather, and remembered visiting the place that Li Shaojun mentioned." (''Shiji'', tr. Watson 1961: 25), it says, "Li Shao Chün indicated to him the places which his grandfather frequented, when shooting. The old man knew them, having visited them as a child with his father." (tr. Forke 1907: 344). Second, when Li recognizes the ancient bronze vessel, the ''Lunheng'' dates it from "the 15th year" (671 BCE) instead of "the tenth year" (676) of the reign of [[Duke Huan of Qi]]. 

More significantly, the ''Lunheng'' omits both the entire passage about Li Shaojun's multipart proposal for the emperor to achieve immortality and the emperor's doubts that Li actually died. The Duke Huan story concludes, "The whole Court was startled, and thought that Li Shao Chün was several hundred years old. After a long time he died of sickness." (tr. Forke 1907: 344). Wang Chong adds some reasons to doubt that Li avoided death through ''shijie'' corpse substitution. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who now-a-days are credited with the possession of ''Tao'' are men like Li Shao Chün. He died amongst men. His body was seen, and one knew, therefore, that his nature bad been longevous. Had he dwelt in mountain-forests or gone into deserts, leaving no trace behind him, he would have died a solitary death of sickness amidst high rocks. His corpse would have been food for tigers, wolves, and foxes, but the world would again have believed him to have disappeared as a real immortal. The ordinary students of ''Tao'' have not Li Shao Chün’s age. Before reaching a hundred years they die like all the others. Yet uncultured and ignorant people still hold that they are separated from their bodies, and vanish, and that, as a matter of fact, they do not die. (tr. Forke 1907: 344) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lastly, Wang Chong gives three reasons to doubt the ''Shiji'' narrative about Li Shaojun.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Grand Annalist [[Sima Qian]] was a contemporary of Li Shao Chün. Although he was not amongst those who came near to Li Shao Chün’s body, when he had expired, he was in a position to learn the truth. If he really did not die, but only parted with his body [i.e., ''shijie''], the Grand Annalist ought to have put it on record and would not have given the place of his death. The reference to the youth of the nonagenarian in the court would prove Li Shao Chün's age. Perhaps be was fourteen or fifteen years old, when the old man accompanied his grandfather as a boy. Why should Li Shao Chün not know this, if he lived 200 years? Wu Ti's time is very far from Duke Huan, when the bronze vase was cast, and Li Shao Chün cannot have seen it. Perhaps be heard once that in the palace there was an old vessel, or he examined the inscription beforehand to speak upon it, so that he was well-informed, when he saw it again. When our amateurs of to-day see an old sword or an antique crooked blade, they generally know where to place it. Does that imply that they saw, how it was wrought? … Li Shao Chün taught ''Tao'' and a method to keep off old age by means of sacrificing to the "Hearth." He determined the period of a tripod cast under Duke Huan of Ch'i, and knew the places frequented, when hunting, by the grandfather of a nonagenarian, and yet he did not really attain to ''Tao''. He was only a long-lived man, who died late. (tr. Forke 1907: 345-346) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Baopuzi==
The Daoist scholar [[Ge Hong]]'s c. 320 ''[[Baopuzi]]'' (Master who Embraces Simplicity) mentions Li Shaojun in three Inner Chapters passages. The longer one recounts his biography differently than the ''Shiji'', and two shorter ones mention him in context with the ''fangshi'' [[Luan Da]] (d. 112 BCE) who promised immortality to Emperor Wu but was executed after failing to provide it.

The ''Baopuzi'' biography of Li Shaojun cites two Han dynasty historical sources that are no longer extant, adding that Li's poverty was the reason he went to Emperor Wu, and an imperial dream foretelling his death. Ge Hong also lists three levels of ''xian'' transcendents and concludes that Li must have used the lowest ''shijie'' "liberation by means of a simulated corpse" because his exhumed coffin did not contain a corpse.
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Dong Zhongshu's ''Family [Lineage?] Records of Li Shaojun'' (李少君家錄), "Li Shaojun possessed an esoteric method for deathlessness, but since his family was poor he lacked the means to buy the ingredients. He therefore presented himself at the Han [court] in order to acquire funds. When his way was complete, he departed." Also, according to the ''Annotated Record of Activities at the Han Court'' (漢禁中起居註), '"When Li Shaojun was about to depart, Emperor Wu dreamed that he was climbing [[Mount Song|Mount Songgao]] with him. Halfway up, a messenger riding a dragon and holding a tally descended from the clouds and announced that Taiyi had invited Li Shaojun. Then the emperor awoke, and told his retainers, 'If what I dreamed is true, Li Shaojun is about to abandon us and depart.' Several days later, Li announced that he was ill, and he died. Later, the emperor had someone open Li's coffin. There was no corpse inside, only his clothing and cap." Now, according to the ''Scripture on Transcendence'' (仙經), superior practitioners who rise up in their bodies and ascend into the void (''juxing shengxu'' 舉形昇虛) are termed celestial transcendents (''tianxian'' 天仙). Middle-level practitioners who wander among noted mountains are termed earthbound transcendents (''dixian'' 地仙). Lesser practitioners who first die and then slough off are termed "escape-by-means-of-a-simulated-corpse transcendents" (''shijiexian'' 屍解仙). Li's must clearly be a case of escape by means of a simulated corpse, then. (2, tr. Campany 2002: 227, cf. Ware 1966: 47 "Corpse-freed Genii") &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Li Shaojun's contemporary [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179-104 BCE) was a Confucianist official under Emperor Wu, see the ''Shenxian zhuan'' below.

The first ''Baopuzi'' context about Li Shaojun and Luan Da (欒大 miswritten as Luan Tai 欒太) says, "The reason people of the world do not believe that transcendence may be practiced and do not grant that one's allotted life span may be lengthened is none other than that the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of the Han sought it without results and that Li Shaojun and Luan Tai [sic] practiced it ineffectively (為之無驗)." (2, tr. Campany 2002: 227, cf. Ware 1966: 42). The second one concerns Ge Hong's contemporary Gu Qiang (古強), a charlatan healer who claimed to be a 4,000-year-old ''xian'', "the wealth amassed by the recent, fraudulent practitioner Gu Qiang is said to be no less than that showered by the Han emperor on Luan Da and Li Shaojun." (20, tr. Campany 2002: 227, cf. Ware 1966: 321).

==Shenxian zhuan==
Besides the ''Baopuzi'', Ge Hong also compiled the original c. 318 ''[[Shenxian Zhuan]]'' (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) that gives a highly detailed hagiography of Li Shaojun, which Campany classifies in "Group A", the earliest-attested content from before 500 CE.

The ''Biographies of Divine Transcendents'' narrative begins with Li meeting Emperor Wu, adding information about his [[courtesy name]] "Cloud Wing" and birthplace in [[Qi (state)|Qi]] (see Duke Huan above). While the ''Shiji'' mentioned Li Shaojun meeting [[Anqi Sheng]], the ''Shenxian zhuan'' adds that he gave Li the immortality elixir formula.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Shaojun, styled Yunyi 雲翼, was a native of Qi. At the time when Han Emperor Wu had issued his call for masters of esoterica, Li had received from Master An Qi 安期 an esoteric method for making an elixir over a furnace fire. Because his family was poor, he could not obtain the necessary medicinal ingredients. He said to his disciples, "I'm about to become an old man. My capital is insufficient. Although I have worked hard behind the plow, it isn't enough to procure all the ingredients. But now the Son of Heaven loves the Dao. I would like to go and have an audience with him and ask him for the resources with which to synthesize the drug. Then I can do as I like." So he presented a method to the emperor, saying, "From natural cinnabar may be produced yellow gold; and when the gold is completed and ingested, one ascends and becomes a transcendent. I have often traveled across the seas, I have met Master An Qi, and I have eaten jujubes as big as melons." The Son of Heaven greatly venerated and honored him and bestowed untold wealth on him. (tr. Campany 2002: 222)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Shenxian zhuan'' narrative summarizes the two stories about Li remembering historical events, and also describes his youthful appearance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Li Shaojun was once drinking and dining with the Marquis of Wu'an. In the group was an elderly man over ninety. Li asked his name. He then commented that he had once traveled with the old man's grandfather, that he had one night seen a little boy following after the grandfather, and that the two of them were consequently former acquaintances. All present at the time were astonished. Also, during Li's audience with Emperor Wu, he noticed an ancient bronze vessel nearby. Recognizing it, he remarked, "Duke Huan of Qi. displayed this vessel in his chamber of repose." The emperor checked his words against the inscription carved into the bronze, and it did indeed turn out to be an ancient Qi vessel. From this he realized that Li was several hundred years old. But he looked to be around fifty. His facial complexion was excellent, his flesh smooth and radiant, and his mouth and teeth were like those of a youth. When the princes, officials, and nobles [at court] heard that he could cause people not to die, they all esteemed him highly and gave him mountains of money. (tr. Campany 2002: 222) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ge Hong adds the element of deception into the narrative. Having obtained imperial patronage to purchase the expensive alchemical ingredients, Li prepared the immortality elixir for himself, feigned illness, and performed ''shijie'' to escape from not only from death but also from his demanding patron (Campany 2002: 226).
&lt;blockquote&gt;And so Li Shaojun secretly made the divine elixir. When it was completed, he said to the emperor: "His majesty is incapable of distancing himself from luxury or of removing himself from music and sex. He cannot call a halt to killings and executions, nor can he overcome joy and anger. He cannot change the fact that for ten thousand ''li'' around there are homeless cloud-souls and in the cities and courts there are bloody punishments. Under such circumstances, the great way of the divine elixir cannot be completed." But he nevertheless gave a minor medicinal formula to the emperor. Li Shaojun then announced that he was ill. That same night [before the news had reached him] the emperor dreamed that he was climbing [[Mount Song]] with Li. When they were halfway up, a [celestial] messenger riding a dragon and holding a seal of office came through the clouds and said that the Grand Monad had invited Li [to ascend into the heavens]. Then the emperor awakened. At once he sent someone to inquire what Li was up to, and he said to his close advisers, "Last night I dreamed that Li abandoned us." When it turned out that Li was ill, the emperor went to call on him, and he also designated someone to receive Li's esoteric methods. But before this matter was concluded, Li expired. The emperor said, "Li hasn't died; he has intentionally departed by transformation, that's all." Meanwhile, the body was being shrouded when suddenly it disappeared. None of the inner and outer garments were unfastened; they were like a cicada shell. The emperor regretted that he had not sought [formulas] from Li more diligently. (tr. Campany 2002: 223) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This ''Shenxian zhuan'' hagiography gives a long account, possibly invented by Ge Heng (Campany 2002: 226), about Li Shaojun preparing a ''waidan'' alchemical elixir for his seriously ill friend Dong Zhongshu, who "often scoffed at people of the world for ingesting drugs and practicing the Dao". Li combined ''[[Polygonatum]]'' with several unidentifiable ingredients and "cooked them in a bronze vessel during the first ten days of the tenth month; young boys who had bathed and purified themselves regulated the heat of the cooking flame." When the medicine was fully transmuted, ingesting one "dose would cause one's body to become light; three doses would cause one's [old] teeth to fall out and new ones to grow in; a full five doses would cause one's allotted life span never to expire." Several months later when Dong's illness worsened, he finally took Li Shao Jun's medicine. First, he took less than half a dose and "his body grew light and strong, and his illness was suddenly healed". After taking a full dose, "his breath and strength were as they had been when he was young. Only now did he believe that there was a way of long life and deathlessness." This experience convinced Dong Zhongshu to resign from the imperial court and spend the rest of his life unsuccessfully searching for a Daoist master who could reproduce Li's immortality elixir, and he remained healthy until his death at more than eighty years. On his deathbed, Dong told his son, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was still young, I obtained Li Shaojun's esoteric medicine. At first I didn't believe in it; after I used it, I regained strength, but then I was never able to grasp [the method for making] it. I will carry this regret with me to the Yellow Springs [where the dead went]. You must go and search among people for a master of esoteric arts, someone who can explain the meaning of this method. If you persist in taking this medicine, you will certainly transcend the world." (tr. Campany 2002: 224) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Campany notes the absence of independent evidence that Dong Zhongshu ever became a believer in Daoist transcendence techniques, although Ge Hong's ''Baopuzi'' cites a text titled ''Fami[y [or lineage?] Records of Li Shaojun'' and identifies Dong Zhongshu as its author (2002: 226).

Although unattested before the [[Tang dynasty]], later ''Shenxian zhuan'' editions of Li Xiaojun's hagiography add a narrative about his disciple, Li Shaoweng (李少翁, Li the Youthful Old Man), who also escapes through ''shijie'' by replacing his body with a bamboo tube [[simulacrum]]. Both of them stage their deaths in time to avoid being compelled to reveal fully their esoteric skills (Campany 2002: 226). Li Shaojun and Li Shaoweng are commonly confused or conflated.

The ''Shiji'', which does not mention Li Shaoweng being a student of Li Xiaojun, says Emperor Wu granted the title ''Wencheng jiangjun'' to the necromancer Li Shaoweng who performed the ''[[Hun and po#History|zhaohun]]'' (招魂, summon the ''hun''-soul) ritual for Emperor Wu's beloved Consort Li (李氏, d. 150 BCE). Over time, Li Shaoweng's magical arts grew less and less effective, and he attempted to deceive the emperor by making an ox eat a message written on a piece of silk, and then announcing, "There appears to be some strange object in this ox's belly!" The ox was killed and cut open, revealing "exceedingly strange" words written on the silk, however, the emperor recognized Li's handwriting and had him secretly executed in 119 BCE (tr. Watson 1961: 28). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At this time there was the General of Civil Accomplishment (Wencheng jiangjun), who also obtained some of Li Shaojun's arts and served under Emperor Wu. Later, the emperor sent an envoy to have him killed. The general told the envoy: "Please apologize on my behalf to the emperor. I cannot bear to lessen my days here and ruin my work on the Great Task. [That is, the work of synthesizing an elixir] If the emperor loves [arts of] caring for oneself, tell him to look for me thirty years hence on [[Chengshan|Mount Cheng]]. We can work on the esoteric method together, and thus he need not resent me." [He was then executed.] When the envoy returned, he relayed the message to the emperor, who ordered [the general's] coffin opened and inspected. There was nothing inside it but a bamboo tube. The emperor suspected that his disciples had stolen and hidden his body, so he had them rounded up and questioned. He was then very remorseful. After his execution of the general, he once again issued a call to all masters of esoterica, and he performed another sacrifice to the Grand Monad at Sweetwater Springs, where he set up another altar and presented offerings to the general. The emperor was in personal attendance at the ceremonies. (tr. Campany 2002: 225) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later texts==
Numerous Daoist texts repeated and expanded the early narratives about Li Shaojun, but his image in the later tradition is not always positive. For instance, the 7th-century commentary to the Taiqing school classic ''Jiudan jing'' (九丹經, Scripture of the Nine Elixirs) refers to Li’s method, saying that the gold of vessels used for eating and drinking "affords longevity as it slowly saturates one’s stomach, permeating the system of transmutation of food into nutritional essences". However, the commentary also blames Li Shaojun because his performance gave more importance to ''cizao'' offerings to the deity of the furnace, described as ''zuǒdào'' (左道, lit. "Ways of the left"; heterodox doctrine; a term often applied to magic), but did not address the "correct" ''waidan'' methods of highest Taiqing deities such as [[Chinese theology#Taiyi|Taiyi]] Great One and the Yellow Emperor (Pregadio 2006: 32, Pregadio 2008: 643-644).

Discussed are the salient points of Jewish, patristic, medieval, and modern commentaries on the Bible. The article includes discussion of the [[Targums]], [[Mishna]], and [[Talmuds]], which are not regarded as Bible commentaries in the modern sense of the word, but which provide the foundation for later commentary. With the exception of these classical Jewish works, this article focuses on Christian Biblical commentaries; for more on Jewish Biblical commentaries, see [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]].

==Jewish commentaries==
{{Main|Jewish commentaries on the Bible}}

===Philo===
A visitor to Alexandria at the time when [[Christ]] was preaching in [[Galilee]] would find there and in its vicinity Jews using the [[Septuagint]] as their Bible, and could enter their Great Synagogue. Whoever had not seen it was not supposed to have beheld the glory of [[Israel]]. The members of their [[Sanhedrin]], according to Sukkah, were seated on seventy-one golden thrones valued at tens of thousands of talents of gold; and the building was so vast that a flag had to be waved to show the people when to respond. At the head of this assembly, on the highest throne, was seated [[Alexander the Alabarch]], the brother of Philo.

Philo himself was a man of wealth and learning, who mingled with all classes of men and frequented the theatre and the great library. Equally at home in the Septuagint and the Greek classics, he was struck and perplexed by the many beautiful and noble thoughts contained in the latter, which could bear comparison with many passages of the Bible. As this difficulty must have frequently presented itself to the minds of his coreligionists, he endeavoured to meet it by saying that all that was great in Socrates, [[Plato]], etc. originated with Moses. He set about reconciling [[Pagan]] philosophy with the [[Old Testament]], and for this purpose he made extensive use of the allegorical method of interpretation. He taught that many passages of the Pentateuch were not intended to be taken literally. In fact, he said that they were literally false, but allegorically true.

He did not make the distinction between natural and revealed religion. For example, Pagan systems may have natural religion highly developed, but, from a Judeo-Christian point of view, with much concomitant error. His exegesis served to tide over the difficulty for the time amongst the Hellenistic Jews, and had great influence on [[Origen of Alexandria]] and other Alexandrian Christian writers.

===The Targums===

Farrar, in his "Life of Christ", says that it has been suggested that when Christ visited the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], at twelve years of age, there may have been present among the doctors [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]], once thought the author of the [[Targum Jonathan|Yonathan Targum]], and the venerable teachers [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]], the handers-on of the [[Mishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04157a.htm|title=Commentaries on the Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Targums (the most famous of which is that on the Pentateuch erroneously attributed to Onkelos, a misnomer for [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], according to Abrahams) were the only approach to anything like a commentary on the Bible before the time of Christ. They were interpretative translations or paraphrases from [[Hebrew]] into [[Aramaic]] for the use of the synagogues when, after the [[Babylonian Captivity|Exile]], the people had lost the knowledge of Hebrew. It is doubtful whether any of them were committed to writing before the Christian Era. They are important as indicating the character of the Hebrew text used.

[[Rashi|Shlomo Yitzchaki]] (1040-1105), more commonly known as Rashi ('''RA'''bbi '''SH'''lomo '''I'''tzhaki), was a [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval French]] [[rabbi]] and author of a comprehensive commentary on the [[Talmud]] and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|commentary on the ''Tanakh'']].

===The Mishna and Talmuds===

Hillel and Shammai were the last "pair" of several generations of "pairs" ([[Zugot]]) of teachers. These pairs were the successors of the early scribes who lived after the Exile. These teachers are said to have handed down and expanded the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]], which, according to the uncritical view of many Jews, began with Moses. This Oral Law consists of legal and liturgical interpretations and applications of the Pentateuch. As no part of it was written down, it was preserved by constant repetition (Mishna). On the destruction of Jerusalem several rabbis, learned in this Law, settled at [[Council of Jamnia|Jamnia]], near the sea, twenty-eight miles west of Jerusalem. Jamnia became the headquarters of [[Council of Jamnia|Jewish learning until AD 135]], due to the [[Third Jewish Revolt]]. Then schools were opened at [[Sepphoris]] and [[Tiberias]] to the west of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The rabbis comforted their countrymen by teaching that the study of the Law (Oral as well as Written) took the place of the sacrifices. They devoted their energies to arranging the Unwritten Torah, or Law. One of the most successful at this was [[Rabbi Akiva|Rabbi Akiba]] who took part in the Third Jewish Revolt of [[Simon Bar-Kochba|Bar Kochba]], against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], and lost his life (135). The work of systematization was completed and probably committed to writing by the Jewish patriarch at [[Tiberias]], Rabbi [[Judah haNasi|Jehudah ha-Nasi]] "The Prince" (150-210). He was of noble birth, wealthy, learned, and is called by the Jews "Our Master the Saint" or simply Rabbi par excellence. The compilation made by this Rabbi is the [[Mishna]]. It is written in [[Hebrew Language|Mishnaic Hebrew]], and consists of six great divisions or orders, each division containing, on an average, about ten tractates, each tractate being made up of several chapters. The Mishna may be said to be a compilation of Jewish traditional moral theology, liturgy, law, etc. There were other traditions not embodied in the work of Rabbi, and these are called additional Mishna.

The discussions of later generations of rabbis all centred round the text of the Mishna. Interpreters or "speakers" laboured upon it both in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Babylonia]] (until 500), and the results are comprised in the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Jerusalem]] and Babylonian [[Talmud]]s. The word Talmud means teaching, doctrine. Each Talmud consists of two parts, the Mishna (in Hebrew), in sixty-three tractates, and an explanation of the same ([[Gemara]]), ten or twelve times as long. The explanatory portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is written in [[Western Neo-Aramaic|NeoWestern Aramaic]] and that of the Babylonian Talmud in Eastern [[Aramaic]], which is closely allied to [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. The passages in the Gemara containing additional Mishna are, however, given in New Hebrew. Only thirty-nine tractates of the Mishna have Gemara. The Talmud, then, consists of the Mishna (traditions from 450 BC till 200 AD), together with a commentary thereon, Gemara, the latter being composed about 200-500 AD. Next to the Bible the Babylonian Talmud is the great religious book of orthodox Jews, though the Palestinian Talmud is more highly prized by modern scholars. From the year 500 till the Middle Ages the rabbis (geonim) in Babylonia and elsewhere were engaged in commenting on the Talmud and reconciling it with the Bible. A list of such commentaries is given in ''The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.

===The Midrashim===

Simultaneously with the Mishna and Talmud there grew up a number of [[Midrashim]], or commentaries on the Bible. some of these were legalistic, like the [[halakhic]] sections of the Talmud but the most important were of an edifying, [[homiletics|homiletic]] character ([[Midrash Aggadah]]). These latter, although chronologically later, are important for the corroborative light which they throw on the language of the New Testament. The [[Gospel of St. John]] is seen to be steeped in early Jewish phraseology, and the words of Ps. cix [[Hebrew Bible]] 110], "The Lord said to my Lord", etc. are in one place{{Where|date=July 2011}} applied to the [[Messiah]], as they are in [[Gospel of St. Matthew 22:44]] (referenced from Psalm 110:1), though [[Rashi]] following the Rabbis interpreted the words in the sense of applying them to [[Abraham]].

===Karaite commentators===

[[Anan ben David]], a prominent Babylonian Jew in the eighth century, rejected Rabbinism for the written Old Testament and became the founder of the sect known a [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] (a word indicating their preference for the written Bible). This schism produced great energy and ability on both sides. The principal Karaite Bible commentators were [[Nahavendi]] (ninth century); [[Abu al-Faraj Harun]] (ninth century), exegete and Hebrew grammarian; [[Solomon ben Yerucham]] (tenth century); [[Sahal ben Mazliach]] (died 950), Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer; [[Joseph al-Bazir]] (died 930); [[Yefet ben Ali|Japhet ben Ali]], the greatest Karaite commentator of the tenth century; and [[Judah Hadassi]] (died 1160).

===Middle Ages===

[[Saadia Gaon|Saadiah of Fayûm]] (died 892), the most powerful writer against the Karaites, translated the Bible into Arabic and added notes. Besides commentaries on the Bible, Saadiah wrote a systematic treatise bringing revealed religion into harmony with Greek philosophy. He thus became the forerunner of Maimonides and the Catholic Schoolmen.

[[Solomon ben Isaac]], called Rashi (born 1040) wrote very popular explanations of the Talmud and the Bible.

[[Tobiah ben Eliezer]] a [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] scholar and [[paytan]] in 11th century [[Kastoria]] ([[Greece]]), wrote the ''Leḳaḥ Ṭov'' or ''Pesiḳta Zuṭarta'', a [[midrash]]ic commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] and the Five [[Megillot]].

[[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] of Toledo (died 1168) had a good knowledge of Oriental languages and wrote learned commentaries on the Old Testament. He was the first to maintain that Isaiah contains the work of two prophets.

[[Moses Maimonides]] (died 1204), the greatest Jewish scholar of the Middle Ages, of whom his coreligionists said that "from Moses to Moses there was none like Moses", wrote his "Guide to the Perplexed", which was read by [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas]]. He was a great admirer of Aristotle, who was to him the representative of natural knowledge as the Bible was of the supernatural.

There were the two Kimchis, especially David (died 1235) of Narbonne, who was a celebrated grammarian, lexicographer, and commentator inclined to the literal sense. He was followed by Nachmanides of Catalonia (died 1270), a doctor of medicine who wrote commentaries of a cabbalistic tendency; Immanuel of Rome (born 1270); and the Karaites [[Aaron ben Joseph of Constantinople|Aaron ben Joseph]] (1294), and [[Aaron ben Elias]] (fourteenth century).

===Modern===

[[Isaac Abarbanel]] (born [[Lisbon]], 1437; died [[Venice]], 1508) was a statesman and scholar. None of his predecessors came so near the modern ideal of a commentator as he did. He prefixed general introductions to each book, and was the first Jew to make extensive use of Christian commentaries. [[Elias Levita]] (died 1549) and [[Azariah dei Rossi|Azarias de Rossi]] (died 1577) have also to be mentioned.

[[Moses Mendelssohn]] of Berlin (died 1786), a friend of [[Lessing]], translated the Pentateuch into German. His commentaries (in Hebrew) are close, learned, critical, and acute. He had much influence, and was followed by [[Wessely]], [[Jarosław]], [[Herz Homberg|Homberg]], [[Euchel]], [[David Friedländer|Friedlander]], [[Hertz]], [[Herxheimer]], [[Ludwig Philippson]], etc., called "[[Biurists]]", or expositors. The modern liberal school among the Jews is represented by [[Salomon Munk]], [[Samuel David Luzzato]], [[Leopold Zunz]], Geiger, [[Julius Fürst]], etc.

[[Pesach Wolicki|Rabbi Pesach Wolicki]] (born 1970) is a biblical scholar and commentator. His book, ''Cup of Salvation'', also known as ''Cup of Salvation: A Powerful Journey Through King David's Psalms of Praise'', which was published by the [[Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation]] (CJCUC) in 2017, is a devotional biblical commentary on [[Psalms]] 113-118 otherwise known as the [[Hallel]].

==Patristic commentaries==
The history of [[Biblical hermeneutics|Christian exegesis]] may be roughly divided into three periods: the Age of the Fathers, the Age of Catenæ and Scholia (seventh to sixteenth century), and the Age of Modern Commentaries (sixteenth to twentieth century). The earliest known commentary on Christian scriptures was by a [[Gnostic]] named [[Heracleon]] in {{CE|the 170s}}. Most of the patristic commentaries are in the form of homilies, or discourses to the faithful, and range over the whole of Scripture. There are two schools of interpretation, that of Alexandria and that of Antioch.

===Alexandrian School===

The chief writers of the [[Alexandrian School]] were:
* [[Pantænus]],
* [[Clement of Alexandria]],
* [[Origen of Alexandria]],
* [[Dionysius of Alexandria]],
* [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]] the blind priest,
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]], and
* [[Pierius|St. Pierius]].
To these may be added
* [[St. Ambrose]], who, in a moderate degree, adopted their system.

Its chief characteristic was the allegorical method. This was, doubtless, founded on passages in the [[Synoptic Gospels|Gospels]] and the [[Epistles of St. Paul]], but it received a strong impulse from the writings of Alexandrian Jews, especially of Philo.

The great representative of this school was Origen (died 254). Origen was the son of [[Leonides of Alexandria]], himself a saint and martyr. Origen became the master of many great saints and scholars, one of the most celebrated being [[St. Gregory Thaumaturgus]]; he was known as the "[[Wiktionary:Adamantine|Adamantine]]" on account of his incessant application to study, writing, lecturing, and works of piety. He frequently kept seven amanuenses actively employed; it was said he became the author of 6000 works ([[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], Hær., lxiv, 63); according to [[St. Jerome]], who reduced the number to 2000 (Contra. Rufin., ii, 22), he left more writings than any man could read in a lifetime (Ep. xxxiii, ad Paulam). Besides his great labours on the [[Hexapla]] he wrote scholia, homilies, and commentaries on the Old and the New Testament. In his scholia he gave short explanations of difficult passages after the manner of his contemporaries, the annotators of the Greek classics. Most of the scholia, in which he chiefly sought the literal sense, are unfortunately lost, but it is supposed that their substance is embodied in the writings of [[St. John Chrysostom]] and other Fathers. In his other works Origen pushed the allegorical interpretation to the utmost extreme. In spite of this, however, his writings were of great value, and with the exception of St. Augustine, no writer of ancient times had such influence.

===Antiochene School===
{{main|School of Antioch}}

The writers of the Antiochene School disliked the allegorical method, and sought almost exclusively the literal, primary, or historical sense of Holy Scripture. The principal writers of this school were
* [[Lucian of Antioch|St. Lucian]],
* [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]],
* [[Maris of Chalcedon]],
* [[Eudoxius of Antioch|Eudoxius]],
* [[Theognis of Nicaea]],
* Asterius,
* [[Arius]] the heresiarch,
* [[Diodorus of Tarsus|Diodorus]] of Antioch, [[Bishop of Tarsus]], and his three great pupils,
* [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]],
* Theodore's brother [[Polychronius]], and
* St. [[John Chrysostom]]. With these may be counted

The great representatives of this school were Diodorus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and St. John Chrysostom. Diodorus, who died Bishop of Tarsus (394), followed the literal to the exclusion of the mystical or allegorical sense. Theodore was born at Antioch, in 347, became Bishop of Mopsuestia, and died in the communion of the Church, 429. He was a powerful thinker, but an obscure and prolix writer. He felt intense dislike for the mystical sense, and explained the Scriptures in an extremely literal and almost rationalistic manner.

His pupil, [[Nestorius]], became the subject of the Nestorian controversy; the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] translated his books into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and regarded Theodore as their great "Doctor". This made Catholics suspicious of his writings, which were finally condemned after the famous controversy on [[Three Chapter Controversy|The Three Chapters]]. Theodore's commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John's Gospel]], in Syriac, was published, with a Latin translation, by a Catholic scholar, Dr. Chabot.

St. John Chrysostom, priest of Antioch, became Patriarch of [[Constantinople]] in 398. He left homilies on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament.  When St. Thomas Aquinas was asked by one of his brethren whether he would not like to be the owner of [[Paris, France|Paris]], so that he could dispose of it to the [[King of France]] and with the proceeds promote the good works of his order, he answered that he would prefer to be the possessor of Chrysostom's ''Super Matthæum''. [[Isidore of Pelusium|St. Isidore of Pelusium]] said of him that if the Apostle St. Paul could have used [[Attic Greek|Attic speech]] he would have explained his own Epistles in the identical words of St. John Chrysostom.

===Intermediate School===

Other writers combined both these systems, some leaning more to the allegorical and some to the literal sense. The principal contributors were
* [[Isidore of Pelusium]],
* [[Theodoret]],
* [[St. Basil]],
* [[St. Gregory of Nazianzus]],
* [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]],
* [[St. Hilary of Poitiers]],
* [[Ambrosiaster]],
* St. [[Jerome]],
* St. [[Augustine]],
* [[St. Gregory the Great]], and
* [[Pelagius]].

Jerome, besides his translations of Scripture and other works, left many commentaries, in some of which he departed from the literal meaning of the text. At times he did not always indicate when he was quoting from different authors, which according to [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] accounts for his apparent discrepancies.

==Medieval commentaries==
The medieval writers were content to draw from the rich treasures left them by their predecessors. Their commentaries consisted, for the most part, of passages from the Church Fathers, which they connected together as in a chain, a ''[[catena (Biblical commentary)|catena]]''.

===Greek Catenists===

* [[Procopius of Gaza]] (sixth century) was one of the first to write a catena. He was followed by
* [[St. Maximus, Martyr]] (seventh),
* [[St. John Damascene]] (eighth),
* Olympiodorus (tenth),
* [[Oecumenius|Ecumenius]] (tenth),
* [[Nicetas of Constantinople]] (eleventh),
* [[Theophylact of Ohrid|Blessed Theophylactus]], Archbishop in Bulgaria (eleventh),
* [[Euthymius Zigabenus]] (twelfth), and the
* writers of anonymous catenæ edited by [[John Antony Cramer]] and [[Cardinal Mai]].

===Latin Catenists, Scholiasts, etc.===

The principal Latin commentators of this period were the Venerable Bede, Walafrid Strabo, Anselm of Laon, Hugh of Saint-Cher, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Nicholas de Lyra.

The [[Venerable Bede]] (seventh to eighth century), a good Greek and Hebrew scholar, wrote a useful commentary on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament. It is in reality a catena of passages from Greek and Latin Fathers judiciously selected and digested.

[[Walafrid Strabo]] (ninth century), a Benedictine, was credited with the "[[Glossa Ordinaria]]" on the entire Bible. It is a brief explanation of the literal and mystical sense, based on Rabanus Maurus and other Latin writers, and was one of the most popular works during the Middle Ages, being as well known as "The Sentences" of Peter Lombard.

[[Anselm of Laon]], professor at Paris (twelfth century), wrote the ''[[Glossa Interlinearis]]'', so called because the explanation was inserted between the lines of the Vulgate.

[[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] (Hugo de Sancto Caro), thirteenth century), besides his pioneer [[Biblical concordance]], composed a short commentary on the whole of the Scriptures, explaining the literal, allegorical, analogical, and moral sense of the text. His work was called ''Postillæ'', i. e. ''post illa'' (''verba textus''), because the explanation followed the words of the text.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (thirteenth century) left commentaries on Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Epistles of St. Paul, and was the author of the well-known ''Catena Aurea'' on the Gospels. This consists of quotations from over eighty [[Church Fathers]]. He throws much light on the literal sense and is most happy in illustrating difficult points by parallel passages from other parts of the Bible.

[[Nicholas de Lyra]] (thirteenth century), joined the [[Franciscans]] in 1291 and brought to the service of the Church knowledge of Hebrew and rabbinical learning. He wrote short notes or ''Postillæ'' on the entire Bible, and set forth the literal meaning with great ability, especially of the books written in Hebrew. This work was most popular, and in frequent use during the late Middle Ages, and [[Martin Luther]] was indebted to it.

A great impulse was given to exegetical studies by the [[Council of Vienne]] which decreed, in 1311, that chairs of Hebrew, Chaldean, and Arabic should be established at Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca.

Besides the major writers already mentioned the following are some of the principal exegetes, many of them Benedictines, from patristic times till the Council of Trent:

* [[Cassiodorus]] (sixth century);
* [[Isidore of Seville|Saint Isidore of Seville]] (seventh);
* [[Julian of Toledo]] (seventh);
* [[Alcuin]] (eighth);
* [[Rabanus Maurus]] (ninth);
* [[Druthmar]] (ninth);
* [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (ninth);
* [[Bruno of Würzburg]], a distinguished Greek and Hebrew scholar;
* [[Bruno of Cologne|St. Bruno]], founder of the Carthusians (eleventh);
* [[Gilbert of Poitiers]];
* [[Andrew of Saint Victor]] (twelfth);
* [[Rupert of Deutz]] (twelfth);
* [[Alexander of Hales]] (thirteenth);
* [[Albertus Magnus]] (thirteenth);
* [[Paul of Burgos]] (fourteenth to fifteenth);
* [[Alphonsus Tostatus]] of Avila (fifteenth);
* [[Ludolph of Saxony]]; and [[Dionysius the Carthusian]], who wrote a commentary on the whole of the Bible;
* [[Jacobus Faber Stapulensis]] (fifteenth to sixteenth);
* [[Gagnaeus]] (fifteenth to sixteenth).
* [[Erasmus]] and [[Cardinal Cajetan]] (sixteenth).

==Modern Catholic commentaries==

The influx of Greek scholars into Italy after the fall of Constantinople, the Christian and anti-Christian Renaissance, the invention of printing, the controversial excitement caused by the rise of Protestantism, and the publication of polyglot Bibles by Cardinal Ximenes and others, gave renewed interest in the study of the Bible among Catholic scholars. Controversy showed them the necessity of devoting more attention to the literal meaning of the text, according to the wise principle laid down by St. Thomas in the beginning of his "Summa Theologica".

It was then that the Jesuits, founded in 1534, stepped into the front rank to counter the attacks on the Catholic Church. The Ratio Studiorum of the Jesuits made it incumbent on their professors of Scripture to acquire a mastery of Greek, Hebrew, and other Oriental languages. [[Alfonso Salmeron]], one of the first companions of [[Ignatius Loyola]], and the pope's theologian at the Council of Trent, was a distinguished Hebrew scholar and voluminous commentator. [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], one of the first Christians to write a Hebrew grammar, composed a valuable commentary on the [[Psalms]], giving an exposition of the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Vulgate texts. It was published as part of [[Cornelius a Lapide]]'s commentary on the whole Bible. Cornelius a Lapide, S. J. (born 1566), was a native of the Low Countries, and was well versed in Greek and Hebrew. During forty years he devoted himself to teaching and to the composition of his great work, which has been highly praised by Protestants as well as Catholics.

[[Juan Maldonato]], a Spanish Jesuit, born 1584, wrote commentaries on Isaias, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, Psalms, Proverbs, Canticles (Song of Solomon), and Ecclesiastes. His best work, however, is his Latin commentary on the Four Gospels, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the best ever written. When Maldonato was teaching at the University of Paris the hall was filled with eager students before the lecture began, and he had frequently to speak in the open air.

Great as was the merit of the work of Maldonato, it was equalled by the commentary on the Epistles by [[Estius]] (born at Gorcum, Holland, 1542), a secular priest, and superior of the College at Douai. These two works are still of the greatest help to the student.

Many other Jesuits were the authors of valuable exegetical works, e.g.:
* [[Francis Ribera of Castile]] (born 1514);
* [[Francisco de Toledo (Cardinal)|Cardinal Toletus]] of Cordova (born 1532);
* [[Manuel de Sá]] (died 1596);
* [[Bonfrère of Dinant]] (born 1573);
* [[Mariana of Talavera]] (born 1537);
* [[Luis del Alcázar|Alcazar of Seville]] (born 1554);
* [[Barradius]] "the Apostle of Portugal";
* [[Sánchez of Alcalá]] (died 1628);
* [[Nicholas Serarius]] of Lorraine (died 1609);
* [[Lorinus of Avignon]] (born 1559);
* [[Tirinus of Antwerp]] (born 1580);
* [[Menochius of Pavia]];
* [[Pereira of Valencia]] (died 1610); and
* [[Pineda of Seville]].

The Jesuits were rivalled by
* [[Arias Montanus]] (died 1598), the editor of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible;
* [[Sixtus of Siena]], O. P. (died 1569);
* [[Johann Wild]] (Ferus), O. S. F.;
* [[Dominic Soto]], O. P. (died 1560);
* [[Andreas Masius]] (died 1573);
* [[Jansen of Ghent]] (died 1576);
* [[Génébrard of Cluny]] (died 1597);
* [[Antonio Agelli]] (died 1608);
* [[Luke of Bruges]] (died 1619);
* [[Calasius]], O. S. F. (died 1620);
* [[Malvenda]], O. P. (died 1628);
* [[Jansen of Ypres]]
* [[Simeon de Muis]] (died 1644);
* [[Jean Morin (theologian)|Jean Morin]], Oratorian (died 1659);
* [[Isaac Le Maistre]] (de Sacy);
* [[John Sylveira]], Carmelite (died 1687);
* [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (died 1704);
* [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], Oratorian (died 1712);
* [[Calmet]], Benedictine, who wrote a valuable dictionary of the Bible, of which there is an English translation, and a highly esteemed commentary on all the books of Scripture (died 1757);
* [[Louis de Carrières]], Oratorian (died 1717);
* [[Piconio]], Capuchin (died 1709);
* [[Bernard Lamy (mathematician)|Bernard Lamy]], Oratorian (died 1715);
* [[Pierre Guarin]], O. S. B. (died 1729);

*The Explanatory Bible of [[Aleksandr Lopukhin]] and successors (1904-1913) is written by professors of Russian theological seminaries and academies. It's based on Russian Synodal Translation, its authors apply to ancient sources of the text ([[Masoretic Text]], [[Septuagint]], etc.). At the present time, is the only full Russian Orthodox Bible commentary on both canonical and deuterocanonical books of the Scripture. The Lopukhin Bible was republished in 1987 by Biblical Societies of Northern Europe countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ekzeget.ru/tolk_info.php?tolk=%D2%EE%EB%EA%EE%E2%E0%FF%20%C1%E8%E1%EB%E8%FF%20%C0.%CF.%20%CB%EE%EF%F3%F5%E8%ED%E0|title=Толковая Библия А.П.

The opinions of the English rationalists were disseminated on the Continent by [[Voltaire]] and others. In Germany the ground was prepared by the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)#Philosophy|Wolff]] and the writings of his disciple [[Johann Salomo Semler|Semler]]. The posthumous writings of [[Hermann Samuel Reimarus|Reimarus]] were published by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] between 1774-78 (''The Fragments of Wolfenbüttel''). Lessing pretended that the author was unknown. According to the "Fragments", Moses, Christ, and the Apostles were impostors. Lessing was vigorously attacked, especially by Goeze. [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn|Eichhorn]], in his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (Leipzig 1780-83, 3 vols.), maintained that the Scriptures were genuine productions, but that, as the Jews saw the intervention of God in the most ordinary natural occurrences, the miracles should be explained naturally.

[[Heinrich Paulus]] (1761–1850), following the lead of Eichhorn, applied to the Gospels the naturalistic method of explaining miracles. G. L Bauer, Heyne (died 1812), and Creuzer denied the authenticity of the greater portion of the Pentateuch and compared it to the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. The greatest advocate of such views was [[Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette|de Wette]] (1780–1849), a pupil of Paulus. In his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (1806) he maintained that the miraculous narratives of the Old Testament were popular legends, which in the course of centuries, became transformed and transfused with the marvellous and the supernatural, and were finally committed to writing in perfectly good faith.

[[David Strauss]] (1808–74) applied this mythical explanation to the Gospels.&lt;ref name=Strauss&gt;{{cite book | author = David Strauss  |title = The Life of Jesus Critically Examined (translated into English by Marian Evans 1860 | publisher = Calvin Blanchard | year = 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed most clearly, that if with Paulus the Gospels are allowed to be authentic, the attempt to explain the miracles naturally breaks down completely. Strauss rejected the authenticity and regarded the miraculous accounts in the Gospels as naive legends, the productions of the pious imaginations of the early generations of Christians.

The views of Strauss were severely criticized by the Catholics, Kuhn, Mack, Hug, and Sepp, and by the Protestants Neander, Tholuck, Ullman, Lange, Ewald, Riggenbach, Weiss, and Keim.

Baur originated a theory which was for a time in great vogue, but which was afterwards abandoned by the majority of critics. He held that the New Testament contains the writings of two antagonistic parties amongst the Apostles and early Christians. His principal followers were [[Eduard Zeller|Zeller]], [[Albert Schwegler|Schwegler]], [[Gottlieb Jakob Planck|Planck]], [[Köslin (theologian)|Köslin]], [[Ritsch]], [[Adolf Bernhard Christoph Hilgenfeld|Hilgenfeld]], Volkmar, Tobler, [[Karl Theodor Keim|Keim]], [[Hosten (theologian)|Hosten]], some of whom, however, emancipated themselves from their master.

Besides the writers already mentioned, the following wrote in a rationalistic spirit:

* Wellhausen,
* Wieseler,
* Jülicher,
* Beyschlag,
* [[H. Holtzmann]], and his collaborators
* Schmiedel, von Soden
{{col-end}}

Holtzmann, while practically admitting the authenticity of the Gospels, especially of St. Mark, explains away the miracles. He believes that miracles do not happen, and that the scripture are merely echoes of Old Testament miracle stories.  Holtzmann was severely taken to task by several writers in the "International Critical Commentary". The activity of so many acute minds has thrown great light on the language and literature of the Bible.

'''''Murari''''' is a 2001 [[India]]n [[Telugu language|Telugu]]-language [[Supernatural film|supernatural]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written, and directed by [[Krishna Vamsi]]. The film features [[Mahesh Babu]] in the title role with [[Sonali Bendre]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Sukumari]], [[Kaikala Satyanarayana]] and [[Gollapudi Maruthi Rao]]. [[Mani Sharma]] composed the music while [[Bhupati]] handled the cinematography. [[Peter Hein]] debuted as choreographer of action sequences with this film. The film marked the last on screen appearance of veteran Telugu actor [[Dhulipala Seetarama Sastry]].

The film revolves around the happy-go-lucky Murari whose [[Zamindar]] ancestors have been victims of Goddess [[Durga]]'s generational curse since the mid 19th century. Every 48 years the Royal Family's heirs lose their life in their early 30s due to this curse. No matter how many religious [[ritual]]s are being performed since ages, the family loses their heirs. In this generation, Murari is the one to be succumbed by the curse. The film deals with Murari's redemption to overcome the curse through his spiritual will, and through his grand mother's self sacrifice. The film was released on 16 February 2001 to positive reviews, and became a super hit in Telugu cinema.

The film was later dubbed into Hindi as ''Rowdy Cheetah'' by Goldmines Telefilms in 2014.

==Plot==
Set up in the 18th century, during [[Amavasya]], the [[dark moon]] lunar phase, a greedy, and lavish alcoholic [[zamindar]] insults principal [[Deity]] [[Durga]] and attempts to steal the [[Panchaloha]] idol from the Royal Family's Temple in a state of [[inebriation]] so that he can repay his huge debt to the [[British people|British]] officers. Subsequently, he along with the British officer's are killed by the enraged Goddess Durga. The goddess infuses a mythical curse on the family's heirs, and every 48 years on the day of Diwali, one male heir from the Royal Family is succumbed to death. The present year 2001 denotes end of another 48 years, and Murari (Mahesh Babu), the Grandson of Sabari whose husband died 48 years back because of the curse, is expected to be the next heir to be succumbed to the curse. Murari lives with his father Sattipandu, Sister-in-law Gopi, brothers Sreenayya, Baachi and Soori and their respective wives and kids along with Sabari. Murari is named after Sabari's husband and thus is called with utmost respect by all family members except Gopi who calls him either by his name or as Kanayya. She treats him like her son and even decides to go for abortion clandestinely so that she would not neglect him once she has her own offspring. Thus since his childhood Murari considers Gopi as his mother since his mother died giving birth to him.

In another village, a beautiful city-bred Agricultural student called Vasundhara lives along with her big combined family and is the cynosure of all eyes and affection in the family. Sattipandu and Vasundhara's father Chanti are blood related and actually Gopi is Chanti's adopted daughter. These two families are separated because of a feud at Gopi's marriage because of Chanti's evil son Rambabu. Every year, Gopi is allowed to go there without any escort from her husband and when a tussle happens regarding this, Sreenayya apologizes and tries to patch up with her. At that point, Murari comes to know about Gopi's sacrifice for him when he secretly listens their conversation. For the first time, Gopi gets an escort in the form of Murari after this incident. There after few incidents, Murari falls in love with Vasundhara but leaves the house because of a land dispute with Rambabu with Gopi staying back there for few more days. Vasundhara tries to convey her love but she had no chance and returns to Hyderabad.

Back at Murari's home town, the temple priest Seshayya comes to know that Murari is going to be the victim of Devi's curse but he does not disclose the same to Sabari who goes for a pilgrimage. Meanwhile with assurance from his father, Murari goes to Hyderabad and unites with Vasundhara. They go back to Murari's house where Vasundhara lies that she came for Agricultural research. Slowly the couple gets the nod from all the members of both of the families. Meanwhile Sabari, who returns from the pilgrimage, upon being informed by Seshayya that Murari would be subjected to death by Devi this year, refuses for the marriage. Rambabu announces marriage of Vasundhara with her cousin Bullabbayi that day and when informed by Chanti, Murari tries to quit the temple to save her but is stopped by Sabari. Then she reveals the dark secret that is kept under wraps about Durga's curse to her family when they all are at the temple offering prayers for [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]]. Murari promises to Sabari that he would come alive along with Vasundhara to complete his [[Abhisheka]].

Murari goes to Vasundhara's place and saves her from Bullabbayi but once they are about to leave, Murari is fatally stabbed by Bullabbayi unintentionally and thus runs away on seeing Murari bleeding. In extreme pain, Murari realizes this as Goddess Durga's ploy and with all strength he manages to come back to the temple along with Vasundhara. He manages to convince everyone that he is safe and sound as he covered his wounds with soil and a cloth but Soori notices blood stains. Before he could say anything, Murari tells him to call an ambulance immediately and takes part in the rituals despite extreme pain and internal bleeding. By the time the rituals of Abhisheka, Yajna, and Arti end, the blood of Murari spills over the Holy Idol invoking the soul spirit, and as a result Murari loses his consciousness and is in critical condition. Seeing this, Sabari drowns herself in the holy river as a sacrifice to the Goddess, and saves Murari's life. Murari revives and marries Vasundhara.

===Development===
When [[Krishna Vamsi]] visited a temple in a village, he came to know about a very famous person there whose three sons died under suspicious circumstances at regular intervals 4 years back. When he spoke to the local people, they said that the big man killed a worker from lower cadre by hiring some goons and the wife of that killed person came to this person's house and cursed that all his three sons would be dying with in six months. After listening to them, he was intrigued by all these incidents. As a part of his research, he visited temples and observed the architectures, sculptors and also read books like Yogi's Autobiography etc. He said "I met highly qualified people like [[Sirivennela Sitaramasastri]] to enhance my knowledge in various things. I also studied the visions of our ancestors, who during their time have designed things like missiles, television, aircrafts{{sic}} etc" in an interview. He added "We always have an answer for any questions that start with 'what', 'how' and 'when'. But we do not have any reason or answer for questions starting with 'why'. I had this kind of backdrop in my mind and wanted to make a film. When a film in the combination of [[Mahesh Babu]] and Krishna Vamsi was announced, I though I should make all those mystic questions get a representation in this film." He wanted to incorporate Telugu culture and tradition with a festive mood and thus used a joint-family backdrop.&lt;ref name="Making of Murari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/interview_krishnavamsi1.html|title=Interview with Krishna Vamsi Part – II by Jeevi|publisher=[[Idlebrain.com]]|date=13 February 2003|accessdate=18 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018113418/http://www.idlebrain.com/celeb/interview/interview_krishnavamsi1.html|archivedate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]]'s 1971 film ''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'', Krishna Vamsi wanted to kill Mahesh Babu's character in this film as he felt that except ''Anand'', no other film introduced a hero who would be dying very soon. During the story discussions, when he said the same to his team, none accepted. He aimed to go in reverse trend and form the film's screenplay as story writers used to create a problem and then introduced the hero to solve it in Telugu cinema. After meeting Mahesh Babu, Krishna Vamsi decided to use the story of [[Krishna]] for the family part. He clarified that it was not a true adaptation of Lord Krishna's life but he got inspired by the characterizations in Krishna's story. According to Krishna Vamsi, the death points Murari faces in the film are inspired from the attacks of ''[[rakshasa]]'' on [[Krishna]] and the fatal attack in the climax was inspired from Lord Krishna's death in the hands of a ''[[Yadava]]'' hunter.&lt;ref name="Making of Murari"/&gt; Sri Sita Ramachandra Swamy temple at Ammapally near Shamshabad was selected for filming key scenes related to the curse part of the story and the temple gained prominence after the film's release. A strong belief in the film industry emerged that a film with scenes shot at the temple will do well at the box-office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ancient-temple-abuzz-with-film-shoots/article1555396.ece|title=Ancient temple abuzz with film shoots|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 March 2011|accessdate=18 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018121223/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ancient-temple-abuzz-with-film-shoots/article1555396.ece|archivedate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]], [[Kaikala Satyanarayana]], [[Prasad Babu]], [[Gollapudi Maruthi Rao]], Deekshitulu and [[Raghu Babu]] were a part of the film's principal cast. [[Ravi Babu]] played a negative role in the film.&lt;ref name="Making of Murari"/&gt; Actress [[Sukumari]] was selected to play the character of Sabari, Mahesh Babu's grandmother in the film which was one of her widely remembered role in Telugu cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Actress-Sukumari-passes-away/articleshow/19223827.cms|title=Actress Sukumari passes away|publisher=The Times of India|date=26 March 2013|accessdate=18 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018120234/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/Actress-Sukumari-passes-away/articleshow/19223827.cms|archivedate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran film actor and religious guru [[Dhulipala Seetarama Sastry]] made a cameo appearance which was his last film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Veteran-actor-Dhulipala-is-dead/articleshow/1907576.cms|title=Veteran actor Dhulipala is dead|publisher=The Times of India|date=14 April 2007|accessdate=18 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018120433/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/Veteran-actor-Dhulipala-is-dead/articleshow/1907576.cms|archivedate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
Regarding Mahesh's character in the film, Krishna Vamsi said "During that time, I met Mahesh Babu a couple of times. He has a 'mugdha manohara mohana roopam' meaning that Mahesh has very beautiful look which can mesmerize anyone. I was impressed to such an extent that I wanted to add 'Krishna tatvam' to that film, as 'mugdha manohara mohana roopam' is the first quality of Lord Krishna. Just like the way Krishna had herd of cows, hero in this film had an animal (elephant). I wanted to create the atmosphere of ''[[Brindavanam]]''. That's the reason why Mahesh is shown to be moving along with and surrounded by girls/women and kids". Sonali Bendre's characterization in the first half was based on [[Satyabhama]] and her characterization in the second half was based on [[Rukmini]]. Because of that, Krishna Vamsi incorporated a scene similar to ''Rukmini Kalyanam'' (Lord Krishna takes Rukhmini away from her place and marries her without the knowledge of her people) in the second half where Murari's character saves Vasundhara from her evil brother and takes away her from her village to marry her. Lakshmi character was based on [[Yasoda]] while Prasad Babu and Kaikala Satyanarayana's roles were partially inspired from [[Balarama]]'s character. According to Krishna Vamsi, the other ''Yadavas'' in the film were the brothers and family members of hero while Ravi Babu's character was a mix of characterizations of [[Sisupala]], [[Karna]] and [[Duryodhana]]. Two separated joint families like that of ''[[Pandavas]]'' and ''[[Kauravas]]'' were created though they are on good terms unlike the way portrayed in Lord Krishna's story.&lt;ref name="Making of Murari"/&gt; [[Prakash Raj]] played a cameo as the evil [[zamindar]] who was the first victim of the curse while Deekshitulu played the role of the temple's priest named Seshayya.

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews. ''idlebrain.com'' gave a review stating "The credit for the success or failure of this film should go to the Krishna Vamsi. This film is bound get a little bit of dissent from the viewers of C class areas. But, this film is classic masterpiece for the class audience and highly recommended for the Mahesh and Krishnavamsi fans. This film will be a good fare for the people if they watch this film with no expectations. Just watch this film to experience Krishna Vamsi paint the silver screen with his classic strokes" and rated the film 3.5/5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idlebrain.com/movie/archive/mr-murari.html|title=Movie review – Murari|publisher=idlebrain.com|date=17 February 2001|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''fullhyd.com'' gave a review stating "Murari starts off on a good note with the desecration of the temple by Prakash Raj for money, and builds up an interesting story as to how three members of their family cursed by Devi Maa give up their lives. But the story soon loses its steam as we know for sure the sacrificial lamb. Murari is a typical Hum Aapke Hain Kaun kind of film with all the fun and laughter and the goodness among the people. It is good family movie with best cinematography and best performance by artists and rated the film 8/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.fullhyderabad.com/murari/telugu/murari-movie-reviews-1694-2.html|title=Murari Movie Review|publisher=fullhyd.com|date=17 February 2001|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Nanyo Shrine'''|南洋神社|Nan'yō-jinja}} is a [[Shinto]] shrine located on the island of [[Koror]], in [[Palau]]. The shrine was the ''ichinomiya'' of the government of the [[South Pacific Mandate]], a [[League of Nations mandate]]d territory administered by the [[Empire of Japan]]. It was established in 1940 and designated for the veneration of [[Amaterasu Omikami]].&lt;ref name="peattie226"&gt;Peattie, Mark R. (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHxdSkoo4AMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=  ''Nanʻyō: the rise and fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885–1945,'' p. 226.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The process which led to the establishment of the shrine began mid-1930s when the regional planning agency (''Nan'yō Takushoku'') was charged with the Japanization of [[Micronesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guichard-Anguis, Sylvie ''et al.'' (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yTBsgZcsD8C&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=  ''Japanese Tourism and Travel Culture,'' p. 181.]&lt;/ref&gt;   The chief advocate for the shrine was Domoto Teiichi, who had been the Private Secretary to the [[Governor of the South Pacific Mandate]] since 1936.&lt;ref name="peattie226"/&gt;

The enshrinement ceremonies took three days, November 1–3, 1940 (''[[Showa Era|Showa]] 15, 1st–3rd day of the 11th month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc: 昭和十五年十一月一日 --&gt;. The shrine was situated at Koror because it was the Japanese colonial capital. From the outset, the Nan'yō Shrine was officially designated one of the ''Kanpei-taisha'' (官幣大社), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government-supported shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Peattie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHxdSkoo4AMC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=  pp. 225–229.]&lt;/ref&gt; The shrine was construed by the Japanese government as marking "a step forward in the sacred task of constructing a New East Asian Order."&lt;ref&gt;Peattie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHxdSkoo4AMC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq=  p. 229.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces threatened Palau in late 1944, the ''[[kami]]'' and sacred symbols of the shrine were evacuated to Japan by submarine. The shrine remained untouched by American bombing; but Japan's defeat in [[World War II]] ended this colonial administration and a sense of reverence for the shrine structures which were dismantled for use in rebuilding Koror. Only the stone steps to the upper platform and the great stone lanterns still remain as evidence of the former shrine precincts.&lt;ref name="peattie339"&gt;Peattie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHxdSkoo4AMC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=  p. 339 n61.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, plans were developed for a reconstruction of the shrine at its former site,&lt;ref name="peattie339"/&gt; and a miniature replica of the original shrine was completed with the funding of private sponsors from [[Japan]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~un3k-mn/0815-hisaizu.htm 南洋神社], [[Asahi Shimbun]], September 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Philippine Orthodox Church''' is the government-approved and registered legal name of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (Moscow Patriarchate) in the Philippines. Generally, it refers to the officially established [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] presence in the [[Philippines]] as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philippines.orthodox.ph/|title=orthodox.ph - orthodox Resources and Information.|website=philippines.orthodox.ph|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are only four Orthodox canonical missions in the Philippines:
* The [[Philippine Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)|Philippine Orthodox Church]], under the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)&lt;ref&gt;philippines.orthodox.ph&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Exarchate of the Philippines]], under the [[Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]
* The [[Antiochian Orthodox Christian Mission in the Philippines]], under the [[Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand, and All Oceania|Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines]] of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East
* The [[Philippine Mission of the Russian Orthodox Church]], under the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]] (now a semi-autonomous part of the Moscow Patriarchate)

==History==
Around the beginning of the 20th century, Greek sailors settled in [[Legazpi, Albay]] on the island of [[Luzon]]. Their descendants now number no more than 10 families, who have kept their Greek surnames and have become distinguished public figures and intellectuals, including serving in the Greek consulate in Manila.

One of the first Orthodox Christian faithful to arrive in the province of [[Albay (province)|Albay]] was Alexandros Athos Adamopoulos (later anglicised to Alexander A. Adamson), who came to Legaspi City in 1928. Together with his brother and cousin he co-founded [[Adamson University]] in 1932, which is now owned by the [[Vincentian Fathers]] of the [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Roman Catholic Church]].

During the [[American Colonial Period (Philippines)|American colonial regime]], some Russian émigrées fleeing the [[Russian Civil War]] arrived in the Philippines. In 1935, the Russian Orthodox Church established the first Orthodox parish in Manila, and the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia appointed Father Mikhail Yerokhin as [[vicar]]. The [[Episcopal Church in the Philippines|Episcopal Church]] then permitted Fr. Mikhail to use the north [[transept]] of their Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint John for worship. In 1937, the Russian Orthodox Church built the first Orthodox church in the Philippines, dedicated and named after the [[Panagia Portaitissa|Iberian Icon of the Mother of God]]. Both the Episcopal Cathedral and the Russian Orthodox church in Manila were destroyed in 1945 by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombardment during the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|city's liberation]] at the end of the [[Second World War]].

===Postwar===
In 1949, Archbishop John Maximovitch and 5,500 Russian Orthodox from China were relocated to [[Tubabao]] (now part of [[Guiuan, Eastern Samar]]) in the [[Visayas]], by the [[International Refugee Organization]], with the permission of the newly-sovereign [[History of the Philippines (1946-65)|Republic of the Philippines]]. Archbishop Maximovitch then established a wooden church, orphanage, and other buildings in Tubabao exclusively for the Russian refugees.

Tubabao, however, was and still a small, underdeveloped island which is humid, prone to typhoons, and at times inaccessible due to the [[sea state]] conditions. When a Russian commented that they feared a typhoon would destroy their camp, [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] replied that there was nothing to worry about because "your holy man blesses your camp from four directions every night." Anecdotally, there were no typhoons or floods while Archbishop Maximovitch was there.

Archbishop Maximovitch did not preach the Orthodox faith to locals, and no Filipino was baptised, [[Chrismation|chrismated]], ordained or consecrated during his stay. Through the persistent lobbying of Archbishop Maximovitch to the [[United States Congress]], the refugees were allowed to settle in the United States and Australia beginning in 1951.

===Filipino Orthodox Christians===
In 1989, Adamopoulos saw the need to establish the first Greek Orthodox church in the Philippines and thus established the Hellenic Orthodox Foundation, Inc., but he died in 1993 before the church was completed. The Annunication Orthodox Cathedral&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoc.ph/index.php?section=1|title=aoc.ph|website=www.aoc.ph|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sucat, [[Parañaque City]], [[Metro Manila]], was finished in 1996. Constructed in true Byzantine style and with interior furnishings imported from Greece, it serves hundreds of Filipino Orthodox and Orthodox expatriates in the national capital. The church was consecrated by His All-Holiness [[Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I]] on 5 March 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodox.cn/news/20000420philippines_en.htm|title=PHILIPPINES:  ORTHODOX PATRIARCH VISITS FLEDGLING LOCAL ORTHODOX CHURCH|website=www.orthodox.cn|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Metropolitans Ioakeim and Nikitas, Bishop Dionysios, and a significant number of clergy from overseas assisting. During the service, the entire congregation followed the Patriarch in circumambulating the church. The Patriarch told the people present that the only thing which can really lead man to the land of gladness is the perfect love for his fellow man and for God. The message from the Church of Constantinople is one of love for the people of Southeast Asia, one which assures people everywhere of the immeasurable love of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.ocl.org/?id=7354&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1990, a Filipino [[hieromonk]], Fr. Vincentius Escarcha (a former [[Benedictine]] Abbot and a Roman Catholic priest for more than 20 years in Bajada, [[Cataingan, Masbate]]), together with four nuns and faithful members of his community, were received into the Orthodox Church by Metropolitan Dionysios of the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of New Zealand and assisted by Bishop Sotirios of Zelon. On 19 January 1994, Metropolitan Dionysios and Bishop Sotirios received several Filipino Christians in Manila by Holy Chrismation.

In 1996, the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia was created for the needs of the faithful under the Church of Constantinople. In 2004, the Theotokos Orthodox Church in Bajada was consecrated by Metropolitan Nikitas of Hong Kong and South East Asia. {{As of|2014}} the nuns of the Theotokos Orthodox Monastery in Bajada ran a kindergarten.

===Today===
Within the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, there are currently six (6) active Filipino Orthodox priests in the Philippines (Fr. Vincentius having already retired from active service), along with a couple of nuns, and are now administratively under Metropolitan Nektarios of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. In these communities, the Divine Liturgy and other Orthodox worship services are held in English, Greek and [[Filipino language|Filipino]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omhksea.org/metropolis-of-hong-kong/clergy/|title=Clergy  : OMHKSEA|website=www.omhksea.org|accessdate=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2008, after three months from its application, Metropolitan Archbishop Paul (Saliba), Primate of Australia and New Zealand of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All of the East, accepted the congregation of the Missionary Servants and Handmaids of St. Francis of Assisi together with Pentecostal Methodist Bishop Jeptah Aniceto, who was also appointed as the Vicar of the Davao Vicariate after his ordination to the Orthodox priesthood.

From May 19 to 22, 2008 Metropolitan Archbishop Paul visited the Philippines for the second time, where he had a colloquium with twelve candidates for ordination to the diaconate and the priesthood in Cogeo, Antipolo City and visited the Antiochian Orthodox communities in Antipolo City (Cogeo Village with 500 members, Bagong Nayon 2 with 500 members, Pagrai with 500 members and Sirona with 500 members), San Jose Del Monte City (Feliciano Subdivision, Brgy. Muzon with 500 members, and Pleasant Hills Subdivision, Brgy. San Manuel with 300 members and Kalookan City (Pangarap Village with 500 members).

Archbishop Paul ordained Pascualito D. Monsanto as the first Antiochian Orthodox priest in the Philippines and elevated him to the rank of Archpriest for the Manila Vicariate.

He also ordained Carlos R. Rafanan, a former SVD priest of the Roman Catholic to the Orthodox priesthood; Carlos G. Cabubas to the diaconate; and Abundio J. Delim, Jr., Michael A. Monsanto, Divino Z. Pedraza to the sub-diaconate. He deferred the ordination of the nine (9) candidates pending completion of the required studies on Orthodoxy.

From May 23 to 26, 2008 Archbishop Paul traveled to Davao City to ordain convert Pentecostal Methodist Bishop Jeptah Aniceto as the third antiochian orthodox priest in the Philippines and elevated him to archpriest for the Davao Vicariate. This priest shortly after ordination left the Orthodox Faith. His followers left the Antiochian Church as well and scattered.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

In August 2013 Metropolitan Hilarion, First Hierarch of the Russian Church Abroad, sent Archpriest Seraphim (Bell) and the then Deacon Silouan (Thompson) to help re-establish the Russian Orthodox Church and made the first Divine Liturgy, baptism of catechumens, trained chanters &lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxnepal.org/2013/09/dn-silouan-training-cantors/]&lt;/ref&gt; and the blessing of the first ROCOR mission in the Municipality of Sta. Maria, Davao del Sur &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxnepal.org/2013/09/feast-of-the-dormition/|title=Feast of the Dormition|author=|date=1 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The chapel was dedicated to St. John Maximovitch in honor of the first Russian Orthodox saint who lived in the country. Fr. Seraphim then went to Tubabao Island where the Russian refugees camped. Before departing for Tubabao, Fr. Seraphim served Divine Liturgy in Palo, Leyte at the ROCOR mission dedicated to [[Nikolaj Velimirović|St. Nikolai Velimirovich]], another ROCOR mission in the Philippines &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orthodoxnepal.org/2013/09/divine-liturgy-in-palo/|title=Divine Liturgy in Palo|author=|date=7 September 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They performed baptism in Palo to 10 catechumens &lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxnepal.org/2013/09/holy-baptism-2/]&lt;/ref&gt;, and finally they went to Tubabao Island. On the day of the Feast of the Vladimir icon of the Theotokos, a Divine Liturgy was served in the chapel of the Theotokos on Tubabao Island.  The new chapel is located on the site of the previous chapel of the Mother of God, built by the Russian refugees who lived on the island from 1949–51; the same chapel in which St. John Maximovitch concelebrated during his stay there.  This was the first Liturgy to be served on the island in 62 years &lt;ref&gt;[http://orthodoxnepal.org/2013/09/st-john-maximovitch-and-the-russian-refugee-camp-on-tubabao-island/]&lt;/ref&gt;.

On March 2014, the five province Diocese of Sarangani Province, South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, North Cotabato and Maguindanao Province of the Philippine Independent Catholic Church (also known as Aglipayans) led by their two bishops Esteban Valmera and Rogelio Ringor together with thirteen (13) other Aglipayan clergy petitioned to His Holiness, Patriarch Kiril of Moscow and All Rus' to convert their entire diocese composed of 28 parishes to the Orthodox Church. Inspired by their moves and motives, another Aglipayan group called "Aglipayan Christian Church" under the leadership of their eight bishops and superiors, also write a petition to the Patriarch of Moscow that they also want to convert their entire group and embraced the Orthodox Faith.

The Moscow Patriarchate then reacted and sent Russian Orthodox missionaries to catechize the thousands of people embracing the Orthodox Faith. Among the missionaries who came to the Philippines are Fr. Kiril Chkarboul from Taiwan, Fr. Stanislav Rasputin and Fr. George Maximov from Russia as well as lay missionaries named Alexy (Russian), Timothy (American) and Sergey (Ukrainian). Presently, the Moscow Patriarchate is doing missions to more or less 60 visible parishes in the Philippines, making it instantly the strongest and largest Orthodox jurisdiction in the Philippines.

On September 18, 2014, the Moscow Patriarchate is registered in the government of the Philippines as the Philippine Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate). On September 26, 2014, the Philippine Orthodox Church Deanery of St. John the Baptist based in Ladol, Alabel, Sarangani Province was registered and on September 29, 2014, the Philippine Orthodox Church Deanery of the Mother of God and Ever Virgin Mary based in Aglipayan Village, Sto. Niño, Tugbok, Davao City was also registered.

There are also some independent groups in the Philippines that use the term Orthodox in their names but are not a part of the Orthodox Church neither in communion with or are recognized by any of the 15 autocephalous canonical Orthodox jurisdictions throughout the world.

[[File:TheGovernessRebeccaSolomon.jpg|thumb|''The Governess'' (1851).]]

'''Rebecca Solomon''' (London 26 September 1832 – 20 November 1886 London) was an English painter.

==Biography==

Rebecca was one of eight children born into an artistically-inclined Jewish merchant family in [[Bishopsgate]] in east London. Her father was [[Meyer Solomon|Michael (Meyer) Solomon]], the first Jew to be honoured with the Freedom of the City of London; her mother was Catherine (Kate) Levy. Rebecca was a sister to her more famous painter brothers [[Simeon Solomon]] (1840–1905) and [[Abraham Solomon]] (1824–1862). There were five other children in the family: Aaron, Betsy, Isaac, Ellen, and Sylvester.

Initially Rebecca was taught by her older brother Abraham and then took lessons at the Spitalfields School of Design. She exhibited at [[Royal Academy of Art]] between 1852 and 1868, and also at the Dudley Gallery and Gambart's French Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Gerrish-Nunn, P. 'Rebecca Solomon', in ''Geffrye Museum. Solomon, a Family of Painters: Abraham Solomon (1823–1862), Rebecca Solomon (1832–1886), Simeon Solomon (1840–1905)'' (London, 1985), 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca worked in the studio of [[John Everett Millais]], one of founders of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], and the best known example of her work is a version of Millais's ''[[Christ in the House of his Parents]]''. She also worked with the second wave Pre-Raphaelite artist, [[Edward Burne-Jones]]. As an artist in her own right, she painted works that often reflected gender and social class differences.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, Roberto C. "Rebecca Solomon, Pre-Raphaelite Sister." ''The Review of the Pre-Raphaelite Society'', 12:2 (Summer 2004): 23–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebecca was also active in contemporary social reform movements and in 1859 she joined a group of thirty-eight women artists petitioning the Royal Academy of Art to open its schools to women, which led to the first woman, [[Laura Herford]] being admitted to the Academy in 1860.&lt;ref name="Women in the Victorian Art World"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orr|first1=Clarissa Campbell|title=Women in the Victorian Art World|date=1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Rebecca died aged 54, from injuries sustained after being run over by a hansom cab on the [[Euston Road]] in central London.

==Themes==

Solomon's artistic style was typical of popular 19th-century painting at the time and falls under the category of [[genre painting]]. She used her visual images to critique ethnic, gender and class prejudice in Victorian England. When Rebecca started painting genre scenes, her work demonstrated an observant eye for class, ethnic and gender discrimination. One critic commented on the wholesome, moral and sometimes humanising sentiment in her art, not an uncommon element in Victorian painting.&lt;ref name="Jewish Women's"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirchen|first1=Anita|title=Rebecca Solomon|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/solomon-rebecca|website=Jewish Women Archive|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rebecca's Jewish background was probably instrumental in developing her critical consciousness of difference and prejudice. Over the next ten to fifteen years, her artwork explored the plight of women and minorities, and the dominance of class discrimination in English society.

In the late 1850s Rebecca made a successful transition to classical and historical painting, the most highly valued art within the powerful art academies at the time. True to her vision, she continued to include images that reflected the historical foundations of nineteenth-century social injustice.

'''Rebecca Sugar''' (born July 9, 1987), is an American animator, director, screenwriter, producer, and songwriter. She is known for creating the [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[Steven Universe]]'', which has made her the first woman to independently create a series for the network.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mfl45edfge/rebecca-sugar/|title=Rebecca Sugar – 30 Under 30: Hollywood|date=December 17, 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar was formerly a writer and storyboard artist on the animated television series ''[[Adventure Time]]'' until 2013. Her work on the two series has earned her five [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.emmys.com/bios/rebecca-sugar&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sugar was raised in the Sligo Park Hills area of [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. She simultaneously attended [[Montgomery Blair High School]] and the Visual Arts Center at [[Albert Einstein High School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= 'Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar is a Cartoon Network trailblazer |work= The Washington Post |first= Michael |last= Cavna |date= November 1, 2013 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; (where she was an arts semifinalist in the Presidential Scholar competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/press/printPress.aspx?id=1647 | title=Two Students are Named Presidential Scholars | website= montgomeryschoolsmd.org | date=May 10, 2005 | accessdate=October 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and won Montgomery County's prestigious Ida F.

While at Blair, she drew several comics (called "The Strip" for the school's newspaper, ''Silver Chips'') which won first place for comics in the Newspaper Individual Writing and Editing Contest. "The Strip" ran a comic challenging MCPS's new grading policy from 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://silverchips.mbhs.edu/story/5887|accessdate=October 19, 2017|publisher=Silver Chips Online|title=Silver Chips, Silver Chips Online, Silver Quill win in journalism competitions| author=Goldstein, Jordan|author2=Sekaran, Adith|date=November 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to attend the [[School of Visual Arts]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amidi|first1=Amid|title=Rebecca Sugar Is Cartoon Network’s First Solo Woman Show Creator|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/rebecca-sugar-is-cartoon-networks-first-solo-woman-show-creator-71157.html|publisher= CartoonBrew|accessdate=June 11, 2014|date=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sugar's father Rob, Rebecca Sugar and her younger brother Steven were raised with what he called "Jewish sensibilities". Both siblings observe the lighting of [[Hanukkah]] candles with their parents via [[Skype]].&lt;ref name=jsmicah&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.templemicah.org/newsfolder/newsitems/rebecca-sugar-takes-hollywood-by-storm-with-hit-cartoon-show-steven-universe/| title = Rebecca Sugar takes Hollywood by storm with hit cartoon show 'Steven Universe'| website = Temple Micah| access-date = March 1, 2016| date = May–June 2014| author = Moskowitz, Dan| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024914/http://www.templemicah.org/newsfolder/newsitems/rebecca-sugar-takes-hollywood-by-storm-with-hit-cartoon-show-steven-universe| archivedate = March 5, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a descendant of a Holocaust survivor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Rebecca Sugar (MoCCa 2016) |url=http://bubblebuddiespodcast.tumblr.com/post/142684758203/interview-with-rebecca-sugar-mocca-2016 |website=Bubble Buddies |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |accessdate=June 14, 2018 |date=April 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

=== Early work ===
During her time at the [[School of Visual Arts]], Sugar directed short animated films, including ''Johnny Noodleneck'' (2008).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/rebecca-sugar-before-steven-universe/|title=The Weird, Heartbreaking Pre-'Steven Universe' Work of Rebecca Sugar|date=2016-02-20|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she wrote and animated ''Singles'', in which frequent collaborator [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] acted as an assistant animator, assistant inker and voice actor on the project, while Sugar's brother Steven Sugar acted as an assistant colorist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sugar completed this film as her thesis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sugar also played an important role in the creation of ''nockFORCE'', a cartoon series created by [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] and Jim Gisriel and launched in 2007 on [[YouTube|Youtube.]] In particular, she contributed to the cartoon's backgrounds and characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ianjq/status/636312476930314244|title=ianjq on Twitter: "actually Rebecca helped a number of things in nockFORCE..."|last=|first=|date=|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Sugar published her first graphic novel, ''Pug Davis'', featuring an astronaut dog and his gay sidekick Blouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/12/09/rebecca-sugars-pug-davis/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs {{!}} The Adventure Time Blog {{!}} Rebecca Sugar’s “Pug Davis”|website=archives.frederatorblogs.com|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12673887-pug-davis|title=Pug Davis|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also known for her comic "Don't Cry for Me, I'm Already Dead", a story about two brothers whose shared love of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' takes a tragic turn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Television ===
Sugar first joined the crew of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' as a [[storyboard]] revisionist during the show's [[Adventure Time (season 1)|first season]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Pendleton (2011). "Rainy Day Daydream" [Animatic commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season One [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon Network]].&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the quality of her work, within a month of being hired she was promoted to a storyboard artist, making her debut during the production of the [[Adventure Time (season 2)|second season]].&lt;ref name="jsmicah" /&gt; Her first episode was "[[It Came from the Nightosphere]]".&lt;ref name="firstboard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seibert|first=Fred|title=Rebecca Sugar’s First Board (Nightosphere)|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/10/11/rebecca-sugars-first-board-nightosphere/|publisher=[[Frederator Studios]]|accessdate=January 19, 2013|date=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production for ''[[Steven Universe]]'' began while Sugar was still working on ''[[Adventure Time]]''. She continued working on ''[[Adventure Time]]'' until the show's [[Adventure Time (season 5)|fifth season]], whereupon she left in order to focus on ''[[Steven Universe]]''. Her last episode for ''[[Adventure Time]]'' was "[[Simon &amp; Marcy]]"; following that episode, working on both series simultaneously "became impossible to do". She had also previously encountered difficulty in the production of the ''[[Adventure Time]]'' episode "[[Bad Little Boy]]".&lt;ref name="Kohn 2013-11-01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|title=''Adventure Time'' Writer Rebecca Sugar on ''Steven Universe'', Being Cartoon Network's First Female Show Creator And Why Pop Art Is 'Offensive'|publisher=[[Indiewire]]|date=2013-11-01|accessdate=2013-11-25|last=Kohn|first=Eric|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar returned temporarily to write the song "Everything Stays" for the [[Adventure Time (season 7)|seventh season]] miniseries "[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]".&lt;ref name=stakesairdate&gt;{{cite web|title=[Olivia Olson confirms when 'Stakes' will air]|url=https://instagram.com/p/4-ChaHhw-D/?taken-by=oliviaroseolson|publisher=[[Instagram]]|date=July 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future projects ===
A teaser for a ''[[Steven Universe]]'' television movie, called ''Steven Universe: The Movie'', was released during [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in the summer of 2018. A release date for the film has yet to be announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://collider.com/steven-universe-movie-trailer/#ok-ko-crossover-special|title='Steven Universe: The Movie' Trailer Announces Cartoon Network's Feature-Length Special|date=2018-07-21|work=Collider|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Themes ===
Sugar has discussed the importance of creating [[LGBT]] representation and content, especially in children's entertainment. On [[Cameron Esposito]]'s podcast QUEERY, Sugar stated "I want to champion [[LGBT|LGBTQIA]], all of it, content...in G-Rated, family entertainment. I want to do that forever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/rebecca-sugar/|title=Rebecca Sugar, episode #13 of Queery with Cameron Esposito on Earwolf|website=www.earwolf.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also explained that the show has helped her come to terms with her own identity as a [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] woman. She believes that early and positive exposure to the [[LGBT community]] can help [[queer]] identifying children avoid experiencing shame in their own identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-rebecca-sugar-steven-universe-20180524-story.html|title=Rebecca Sugar’s commitment to LGBTQ visibility continues to drive 'Steven Universe' - Los Angeles Times|last=Brown|first=Tracy|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/13/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-lgbtq-cartoons/|title='Steven Universe' creator is doing more for LGBTQ visibility than you might know|work=EW.com|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] confirmed via [[Twitter]] that he and Sugar were in a romantic relationship; at the time of the tweet, the two had been together for eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ian jq on Twitter: "@CreeperGuy1337 yeah!

In July 2016, Sugar said at a [[San Diego Comic-Con]] panel that the [[LGBT]] themes in ''[[Steven Universe]]'' are in large part based on her own experience as a [[bisexual]] woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mey|title=Rebecca Sugar is Bisexual: "Steven Universe" Creator Comes Out at Comic-Con {{!}} Autostraddle|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/rebecca-sugar-is-bisexual-steven-universe-creator-comes-out-at-comic-con-346094/|accessdate=22 July 2016|work=[[Autostraddle]]|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2018 interview on [[NPR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Joshua |title=The Mind Behind America's Most Empathetic Cartoon |url=https://the1a.org/audio/#/shows/2018-07-09/the-mind-behind-americas-most-empathetic-cartoon/114886/ |accessdate=13 July 2018 |work=1A |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sugar said that she created the series's Gems as "[[non-binary]] women" in order to express herself, as a non-binary woman, through them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=Steven Universe's Rebecca Sugar Comes Out as Gender Nonbinary |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/steven-universes-rebecca-sugar-on-how-she-expresses-her-1827624015 |accessdate=17 July 2018 |work=io9 |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Religion]] in [[Italy]]''' is characterised by the predominance of [[Christianity in Italy|Christianity]] and an increasing diversity of religious practices, beliefs and denominations. Most Christians in Italy adhere to the [[Catholic Church]], whose headquarters are in [[Vatican City]], [[Rome]].

According to the 2012 ''Global Religious Landscape'' survey by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] (an [[United States|American]] [[think tank]]), 83.3% of [[Italy]]'s residents are Christians, 12.4% are [[irreligion|irreligious]], [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], 3.7% are [[Islam|Muslims]] and 0.6% adhere to other religions.&lt;ref name="Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2014/01/global-religion-full.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pewforum.org|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources give different accounts of Italy's Islamic population, usually around 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.arcre.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Islam-en-Italie-31975971.pdf|format=PDF|title=Islam Italiano: Prospects for Integration of Muslims in Italy’s Religious Landscape|journal=Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs|volume=28|date=April 2008|publisher=Arcre.org|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssai.interno.it/download/allegati1/instrumenta_25_09_-_spreafico_%28da_pag._1_a_40%29.pdf|format=PDF|title=La presenza islamica in Italia|first=Andrea|last=Spreafico|publisher=Ssai.interno.it|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkiesta.it/it/article/2011/08/01/quanti-sono-e-cosa-vogliono-i-musulmani/15673/|title=Quanti sono e cosa vogliono i musulmani|date=1 August 2011|publisher=Linkiesta|work=linkiesta.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to other sources, up to 10% of residents, including both Italian citizens and foreign residents, professes a faith different from Catholicism and the number of atheists and agnostics is rising. Among religious minorities, [[Islam]] is the largest, followed by [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Protestantism]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Judaism]].

The country's Catholic patron saints are [[Francis of Assisi]] and [[Catherine of Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/it/briefs/documents/hf_p-xii_brief_19390618_patroni-italia.html|title=Breve Pontificio con il quale San Francesco d'Assisi e Santa Caterina da Siena vengono proclamati Patroni Primari d'Italia (18 giugno 1939) &amp;#124; PIO XII|publisher=Vatican.va|date= |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The 2012 ''Global Religious Landscape'' survey by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] (an [[United States|American]] [[think tank]]) found that 83.3% of [[Italy]]'s residents were Christians, 12.4% were [[irreligion|irreligious]], [[atheism|atheist]] or [[agnosticism|agnostic]], 3.7% were [[Islam|Muslims]] and 0.6% adhered to other religions.&lt;ref name="Survey"/&gt;

Regarding Italian citizens in Italy, according to the 2005 [[Eurobarometer]] poll (conducted on behalf of the [[European Commission]]), 74% of Italians "believe there is a God", 16% "believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 6% "do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Social values, science and technology|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2006 survey by [[:it:Eurispes|Eurispes]] (an Italian research centre), Catholics made up 87.8% of Italian citizens, with 36.8% describing themselves as observants.&lt;ref name="Corriere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/01_Gennaio/17/cattolici.shtml|title=Corriere della Sera - Italia, quasi l'88% si proclama cattolico|publisher=Corriere della Sera|work=corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same poll in 2010, those percentages fell to 76.5% and 24.4%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cronachelaiche.globalist.it/Detail_News_Display?ID=20167|title=Cattolici maggioranza in Italia?|publisher=cronachelaiche.globalist.it|date=14 May 2012|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Eurispes found that 71.1% of Italians were Catholic, 5 points down from 2010, but their religious practice was on the rise at 25.4%.&lt;ref name="Riforma-Eurispes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riforma.it/it/articolo/2016/02/01/litalia-e-le-religioni-nel-2016|title=L’Italia e le religioni nel 2016|date=1 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[:it:Doxa (azienda)|Doxa]] (another Italian research centre) in 2014, 75% of Italians are Catholic.&lt;ref name="doxa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doxa.it/news/religiosita-e-ateismo-in-italia-nel-2014|title=Religiosità e ateismo in Italia nel 2014 - Doxa|website=www.doxa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2016 the [[Pew Research Center]] found that 81.7% of the population of Italy was affiliated with the [[Catholic Church]], out of a Christian population of 85.1%; non-religious people comprised the 11.6% of the total population and were divided in atheists (3.1%), agnostics (2.5%) and "nothing in particular" (6.0%).&lt;ref name="spring2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/dataset/spring-2016-survey-data/|title=Spring 2016 Survey Data {{!}} Pew Research Center|last=|first=|date=|website=www.pewglobal.org|pages=Questions Q109ITA and Q109ITAb|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, according to a 2017 poll by [[Ipsos]] (a [[France]]-based research centre), 74.4% of Italians are Catholic (including 27.0% engaged and/or observant), 22.6% are irreligious and 3.0% adhere to other denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.acli.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cattolici-e-politica-analisi-Ipsos-novembre-2017.pdf|title=I cattolici tra presenza nel sociale e nuove domande alla politica - novembre 2017|publisher=Ipsos MORI|date=17 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124122738/http://www.acli.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cattolici-e-politica-analisi-Ipsos-novembre-2017.pdf|archive-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are significant differences in religious beliefs by gender, age and geography. For instance, according to a 2014 Doxa poll: 80% of women defined themselves as "Catholic", while 69% of men did so; 80% of the people in the age group above 55 defined themselves as Catholic, while 8% said to be irreligious or atheist and another 7% described themselves as "without religious reference"; among people aged between 15 and 34, percentages were 68%, 13% and 12%, respectively; in Southern Italy, 85%, 6% and 5%, respectively; in the North-West, 62%, 16% and 13%, respectively.&lt;ref name="doxa"/&gt;

===The Catholic Church===
[[File:Vatican City at Large.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|300px|[[St. Peter's Basilica]], viewed from the [[Tiber]], the [[Vatican Hill]] in the back and [[Castel Sant'Angelo]] to the right, [[Rome]] (both the basilica and the hill are part of the [[United Nations General Assembly observers|sovereign state]] of [[Vatican City]], the [[Holy See]] of the [[Catholic Church]]).]]
The headquarters of the 1.2-billion strong Catholic Church, the [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]] (see also [[Holy See]]), is an enclave within the city of [[Rome]] and, thus, the Italian territory. The Church's world leader, the [[Pope]], is the [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]] of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], hence the special relationship between Italians and the Church—and the latter's entanglement with [[politics of Italy|Italian politics]] (see [[Lateran Treaty]] and the [[Religion in Italy#Religion and politics|section below]] on religion and politics).

The current Pope is [[Pope Francis|Francis]], born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who, before his [[Papal conclave, 2013|election]] in 2013, is from Argentina and was the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires|Archbishop of Buenos Aires]] from 1998 to his installation. Francis is the third non-Italian Pope in a row, after [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] (1978–2005) from Poland and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]] (2005–2013) from Germany.

Most of the leading [[Catholic religious order]]s, including the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesians]], the [[Franciscans#Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]], the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin Franciscans]], the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedectines]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], the [[Society of the Divine Word|Divine Word Missionaries]], the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorists]], the [[Order of Friars Minor Conventual|Conventual Franciscans]] and the [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate|Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], have their headquarters in Rome too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|country|xrel|Religious Orders|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian territory is divided in 225 [[List of Catholic dioceses in Italy|Catholic dioceses]] (whose [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]] have been organised, since 1952, in the politically influential&lt;ref name="Sangiorgi2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangiorgi|first=Giuseppe|title=La politica impossibile: Cattolici alla ricerca dell'ispirazione cristiana|language=it|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zBJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43|accessdate=4 August 2017|year=2014|publisher=Rubbettino Editore|isbn=978-88-498-4338-5|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9259081|title=By hook or by crook|publisher=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian Episcopal Conference]], CEI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiesacattolica.it/chiesa_cattolica_italiana/cei/00007404_Storia.html|title=Storia|work=Chiesacattolica.it|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.30giorni.it/articoli_id_13529_l3.htm|title=The Italian Episcopal Conference and its Presidents (by Gianni Cardinale)|work=30giorni.it|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Church statistics (which do not consider current active members), 96% of the country's population was [[baptism|baptised]] as Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Catholic-hierarchy|country|sc3|Statistics by Country|21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecclesial life is somewhat vibrant and, despite [[secularization]], some of the most active movements and associations are Catholic, including organisations as diverse as [[Azione Cattolica|Catholic Action]] (AC), the [[Associazione Guide e Scouts Cattolici Italiani|Italian Catholic Association of Guides and Scouts]] (AGESCI), [[Communion and Liberation]] (CL), [[Neocatechumenal Way]], the [[Focolare Movement]], the [[Christian Associations of Italian Workers]] (ACLI), the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]], etc., most of which have been involved in social activities and have frequently supplied Italian politics with their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wertman|first1=Douglas A.|title=The catholic church and Italian politics: The impact of secularisation|journal=West European Politics|date=3 December 2007|volume=5|issue=2|pages=87–107|doi=10.1080/01402388208424359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350333?eng=y|title=Church and Politics.

===Minor historical denominations===
[[File:Tempio Israelitico.JPG|thumb|200px|The [[Great Synagogue of Florence|Great Synagogue]], [[Florence]]]]
Other than that the [[Latin Church|Latin-rite]] Catholic Church, Italy has two more native churches: the [[Italo-Albanian Catholic Church]], one of the twenty-two [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] in communion with the Pope, and the [[Waldensian Evangelical Church]], a Christian movement originated from [[Lyon]] in the late 12th century and turned [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] denomination since the [[Protestant Reformation]] (see also: [[Waldensians]]). The two churches include the majority of the population in [[Piana degli Albanesi]], [[Sicily]] and [[Lungro]], [[Calabria]], and the so-called "Waldensian Valleys" ([[Val Pellice]], [[Val Chisone]] and [[Valle Germanasca]]) of western [[Piedmont]], respectively.

Most historical or, to borrow an American term, [[mainline Protestant|mainline]] [[Protestantism|Protestants]], including the Waldensians (30,000 members), the [[Baptists]] ([[Baptist Evangelical Christian Union of Italy]], 20,000), the mostly [[German diaspora|German-speaking]] [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] ([[Lutheran Evangelical Church in Italy]], 7,000), the [[Methodism|Methodists]] ([[Methodist Evangelical Church in Italy]], 5,000) and minor Calvinist and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] communities, are affiliated to the [[Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy]], along with the Italian section of [[The Salvation Army]] and some minor [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] denominations.&lt;ref name="FCEI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fedevangelica.it/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=253&amp;lang=it|title=Membri|trans-title=Members|language=it|publisher=Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Protestant context, it is also worth mentioning the [[Evangelical Christian Church of the Brethren]] (21,000) and the Italian [[Italian Union of Seventh-Day Adventist Christian Churches|section]] of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (20,000).&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"&gt;[[Massimo Introvigne]], Pierluigi Zoccatelli. "Il pluralismo religioso italiano nel contesto postmoderno". [http://www.cesnur.com/il-pluralismo-religioso-italiano-nel-contesto-postmoderno-2/ CESNUR's 2016 demographic report of minority religions in Italy].&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy is home to around 45,000 [[Jews]],&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/AJYB727.CV.pdf |format=PDF |title=World Jewish Population, 2007 |publisher=Ajarchives.org |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are one of the most ancient [[Judaism|Jewish]] communities in the world. The Jewish presence dates to the pre-Christian Roman period and has continued, despite periods of extreme persecution and expulsions from parts of the country from time to time, until the present. Native Italian Jews, who form the core of the community in Rome, practice the [[Italian rite Jews|Italian rite]], but there are also [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who have settled in the North, especially in the lands of the former [[Republic of Venice]] ([[Veneto]], [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and eastern [[Lombardy]]) and Piedmont, since the late [[Middle Ages]], and [[Sephardi Jews]], who have established themselves mostly in [[Livorno]], [[Florence]], [[Venice]] and several cities of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], after their expulsion from the [[Kingdom of Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.com/lunione-delle-comunita-ebraiche-italiane/|title=L’Unione delle Comunità Ebraiche Italiane|work=cesnur.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community of [[Milan]], the country's second largest after Rome's, is the most international in character and composition, notably including a substantial number of [[Mizrahi Jews]] originating from the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/settembre/01/Gli_ebrei_aprono_sinagoga_co_7_0009017854.shtml|title=Gli ebrei aprono la sinagoga|trans-title=Jews open a synagogue|language=it|author=Gatti Fabrizio|publisher=corriere.it|date=1 September 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003061014/http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2000/settembre/01/Gli_ebrei_aprono_sinagoga_co_7_0009017854.shtml|archivedate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twenty-one Jewish local communities are affiliated to the [[Union of Italian Jewish Communities]], which counts 25,000 members.&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pace|first=Enzo|editor-last=Pace|editor-first=Enzo|title=Le religioni nell'Italia che cambia.

===Immigration and future scenarios===
[[File:Rome Masjid.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Mosque of Rome]]]]

[[Immigration to Italy|Immigration]] has brought to Italy many religious minorities, especially Islam and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]. By the numbers, in 2015 the country was home to around 1,850,000 Muslims and virtually 1,700,000 Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"/&gt; Among the latter, it is especially relevant the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], which has a diocese of Italy, and the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] ([[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]), whose [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy|Archdiocese of Italy and Malta and Exarchate of Southern Europe]] has its [[episcopal see|see]] in Venice. [[Massimo Introvigne]], founder and director of [[CESNUR]] (an Italian think tank devoted to religious studies) and main author of ''L'enciclopedia delle religioni in Italia'', predicts that, thanks to continued immigration from [[Eastern Europe]], Orthodox Christians could soon become the country's second largest religious group, overtaking Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2013/05/13/vaticaninsider/ita/inchieste-e-interviste/immigrati-crescono-gli-ortodossi-5upq1y5HWVtFFnix5K8WjN/pagina.html|title=Immigrati, crescono gli ortodossi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also Protestantism, especially in its evangelical and Pentecostal forms, is on the rise: Introvigne recalls how [[Giorgio Bouchard]], a Waldensian pastor, told him that "when he was born, the typical Italian Protestant was a man, lived in Piedmont, had a last name like Bouchard and was a Waldensian", while "today, the typical Italian Protestant believer is a woman, lives in Campania or Sicily, is named Esposito and is a Pentecostal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/inchieste-ed-interviste/dettaglio-articolo/articolo/religioni-religion-24785/|title=Immigrati, crescono gli ortodossi|publisher=La Stampa|work=lastampa.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly the [[Assemblies of God in Italy]] (150,000 members), the [[Federation of Pentecostal Churches (Italy)|Federation of Pentecostal Churches]] (50,000) and several smaller evangelical/Pentecostal denominations have the majority of their communities in the South.&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Naso"&gt;{{cite book |last=Naso |first=Paolo |editor-last=Pace |editor-first=Enzo |title=Le religioni nell'Italia che cambia.

Among the fastest-growing new religious denominations in Italy a special place is held by the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (who count around 420,000 faithful, including both members and other people regularly attending the Congregation's meetings).&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesnur.com/i-testimoni-di-geova-e-i-loro-scismi/i-testimoni-di-geova/|title=I Testimoni di Geova|work=cesnur.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, come four faiths professed mainly by immigrants: [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (260,000),&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"/&gt; [[Hinduism|Hindus]] (180,000),&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"/&gt; [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (150,000),&lt;ref name="Bertolani"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bertolani |first=Barbara |editor-last=Pace |editor-first=Enzo |title=Le religioni nell'Italia che cambia.

==Demography==
The religious composition of the Italian population (2015 estimate: 60,795,612 people, including 55,782,575 Italian citizens and 5,014,037 foreign residents) is shown in the table below. The primary data source is the aforementioned CESNUR, which includes the data on foreign residents provided by Caritas Italiana.&lt;ref name="Cesnur-pluralismo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dossierimmigrazione.it/docnews/file/Scheda%20Dossier%202015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of a single, coherent and statistically accurate source, the figures are to be taken with a grain of salt and sums do not necessarily add up. The number of Catholics among Italian citizens is calculated using the latest Eurispes poll, released in January 2016: according to the survey 71.1% of Italians are Catholic.&lt;ref name="Riforma-Eurispes"/&gt; The numbers of Christians are consequently calculated, including that number and the data provided by CESNUR and Caritas Italiana.

Religious denominations which have a relevant presence in the country, but for which there are no data, are included in the table.

==Religious practice==
Religious practice, especially [[church attendance]], is still very high in Italy, when compared to the average [[Western Europe]]an country.

The Italian [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|National Institute of Statistics]] (ISTAT) found in 2015 that 29.0% of the population went to church, synagogue, mosque, temple or another house of worship on a weekly basis. The share of practising believers was higher in [[Southern Italy]] (33.5%) than the [[Northwest Italy|North-West]] (27.7%), the [[Northeast Italy|North-East]] (26.8%) and the [[Central Italy|Centre]] (25.0%). Religious practice was particularly high in [[Sicily]] (37.3%); in [[Campania]] (35.4%), [[Calabria]] (34.8%), [[Apulia]] (32.6%) and [[Molise]] (30.9%) in the South; in [[Veneto]] (32.4%), once dubbed "white Veneto" because of [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]'s strength there (white being the party's official colour), and [[Trentino]] (31.4%) in the North-East; in [[Marche]] (31.6%) in the Centre. It was particularly low in [[Liguria]] (18.6%), [[Aosta Valley]] (21.0%), [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] (21.9%), and [[Sardinia]] (21.9%) and the so-called "red regions" (long-time strongholds of the left-wing/centre-left, from the [[Italian Communist Party]] to the current [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]), especially [[Tuscany]] (19.4%) and [[Emilia-Romagna]] (21.6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dati.istat.it/index.aspx?lang=en&amp;SubSessionId=2da4a73f-72e4-46b4-a3dc-1b66e6c78dc7&amp;themetreeid=-200|title=Religious observances:Aspects of daily life:Regions and type of municipality|work=ISTAT|date=20 March 2016|accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion and politics==
{{further|List of Italian religious minority politicians}}
After [[Italian unification]], predominantly supported by secular and anti-clerical forces, and especially the [[capture of Rome]] in 1870, which marked the final defeat of the [[Papal States]] by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and gave start to the so-called [[Roman Question]] over the temporal power of the [[Pope]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/questione-romana/|title=Questione romana nell'Enciclopedia Treccani|website=www.treccani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics largely self-excluded themselves from active politics. As a result, all the main political parties and parliamentary groupings were secular in character until the early 20th century.

In 1905 the [[Italian Catholic Electoral Union]] was formed in order to coordinate the participation of Catholic voters in the Italian electoral contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/unione-elettorale-cattolica-italiana_(Dizionario_di_Storia)/|title=Unione elettorale cattolica italiana  in "Dizionario di Storia"|website=www.treccani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had minor but significant results and, under the so-called [[Gentiloni pact]] in 1913, it entered in alliance with the establishment [[Liberal Union (Italy)|Liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/vincenzo-ottorino-gentiloni_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=GENTILONI, Vincenzo Ottorino in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=www.treccani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], Catholics organised the [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Italian People's Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/partito-popolare-italiano_(Dizionario-di-Storia)/|title=Partito popolare italiano  in "Dizionario di Storia"|website=www.treccani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[Christian democracy]] movement.

During the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] regime, the Roman Question was settled through the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the [[Holy See]] and the Kingdom of Italy in 1929. These gave birth to the [[State of Vatican City]]. Fascism persecuted religious minorities: on 9 April 1935, [[Guido Buffarini Guidi]] outlawed the Pentecostal faith&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Peyrot, ''La circolare Buffarini Guidi e i pentecostali'', Associazione italiana per la libertà della cultura, Rome, 1955, pp. 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;, and during 1938-1939 Jews were targeted by the infamous [[Italian Racial Laws|racial laws]] and were victims of [[genocide]] in the context of [[the Holocaust]].

The [[Italian resistance movement]] saw the participation of Catholics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.storiadellachiesa.it/glossary/resistenza-e-la-chiesa-in-italia/&lt;/ref&gt; Protestants (Waldensians were especially active in the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Various authors|title=Annali della Fondazione Ugo La Malfa XXIV-2009: Storia e Politica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-9d2knvDJQC&amp;pg=PA40|date=2009|publisher=Gangemi Editore spa|isbn=978-88-492-6895-9|pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jews (through the [[Jewish Brigade]]) alike. In 1943 a group of Catholics, including several former Populars and many members of [[Azione Cattolica|Catholic Action]] (a widespread lay association), formed the aforementioned Christian Democracy party and, with [[Alcide De Gasperi]], led the Italian provisional government since 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/democrazia-cristiana_(Dizionario_di_Storia)/|title=Democrazia cristiana in "Dizionario di Storia"|website=www.treccani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], the Catholic Church, after some initial reservations ([[Pope Pius XII]] favoured a solution similar to that of the Church in [[Francoist Spain]], while some [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] wanted a plurality of Catholic parties, possibly including a communist one), actively supported De Gasperi's Christian Democracy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Magister |first=Sandro |date=1979 |title=La politica vaticana e l'Italia, 1943-1978 |url= |location=Rome |publisher=Editori Riuniti |page=39 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graziano |first=Manlio |date=2016 |title=In Rome we trust. L'ascesa dei cattolici nella vita politica degli Stati Uniti |url= |location=Bologna |publisher=il Mulino |page=106 |isbn=978-88-15-26345-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Catholic-inspired but formally non-denominational party, and the so-called "political unity of Catholics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberto Sani|title=La Civiltà cattolica e la politica italiana nel secondo dopoguerra, 1945-1958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-vhRA-UR58C&amp;pg=PA127|year=2004|publisher=Vita e Pensiero|isbn=978-88-343-1171-4|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1946 to 1992 all Prime Ministers but two were Christian Democrats and Catholics.

However, both Waldensians and the Jews have played an important role in Italian politics. While there have been several Catholic-inspired parties also after Christian Democracy's dissolution in 1994 (from [[Italian People's Party (1994)|Italian People's Party]]–1994 to [[Democracy is Freedom – Daisy|Democracy is Freedom]], from the [[Christian Democratic Centre]] to the [[Union of the Centre (2002)|Union of the Centre]], from [[Forza Italia]]–1994 to [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]]–2013, Waldensians have been usually active in "secular" parties, especially the [[Italian Socialist Party]], [[Italian Communist Party]] and, more recently, the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], which is home to former Christian Democrats too. More recently, a group of conservative Pentecostals set up the [[Extended Christian Pact]] party. Also the Jews have been active mostly in "secular" parties, but recently have been more divided between the Democrats and Forza Italia.

==Freedom of religion==
The [[Constitution of Italy]] recognises the Catholic Church and the state as "independent and sovereign, each within its own sphere" (article 7), in respect of the principle of [[separation of church and state]]. In particular, the Lateran Treaty of 1929, which gave a special status to the Church, is recognised and modifications "accepted by both parties" to such treaty are allowed without the need of [[constitutional amendment]]s. In fact, the treaty was later modified by a new agreement between the state and the Church in 1984 under which Catholicism ceased to be the state religion. [[Freedom of religion]] is also recognised, with "all religious denominations" having "the right of self-organisation according to their own statutes, provided these do not conflict with Italian law"; "[t]heir relations with the state are regulated by law, based on agreements with
their respective representatives" (article 8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senato.it/documenti/repository/istituzione/costituzione_inglese.pdf|format=PDF|title=Constitution of the Italian Republic |publisher=Senato.it|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1984, the [[Council of Ministers (Italy)|Italian government]] has signed thirteen such agreements and eleven have been approved by the [[Italian Parliament]] and signed into law, including the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/USRI/confessioni/intese_indice.html|title=Governo Italiano - Le intese con le confessioni religiose|publisher=Governo.it|date= |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Eight per thousand]] system, Italian taxpayers can choose to whom devolve a compulsory 8‰ = 0.8% (eight per thousand) from their annual income tax return between an organised religion recognised by Italy or, alternatively, to a [[Welfare|social assistance]] scheme run by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.governo.it/Presidenza/DICA/2_CONCERTAZIONE_AMMINISTRATIVA_MONITORAGGIO/Servizio_2/ottoxmille/ottopermille.html|title=Italian prime minister's office' explanation of the "otto per mille"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latest available year (2012), 15,226,291 taxpayers chose the Catholic Church, 562,313 the Union of Methodist and Waldensian Churches, 72,238 the Union of Jewish Communities in Italy, 47,859 the Lutheran Evangelical Church in Italy, 44,229 the Evangelical Christian Churches Assemblies of God in Italy, and 29,448 the Italian Union of Seventh-Day Adventist Christian Churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.finanze.gov.it/finanze2/stat_8xMille/index.php?req_anno=2012&amp;req_classe=01&amp;req_pag=1&amp;req_screen=1001|title=Dipartimento Finanze -|website=Dipartimento Finanze}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eight per thousand tax has thus disproportionately helped some minor denominations, particularly the Waldensians.

'''Saitwal''' is a [[Digambara]] [[Jain]] community of [[Jains of Maharashtra|Maharashtra]]. Swahitwal means that they work for the benefit of their inner self (Swa+hit+wal).

Saitwal community is largely concentrated in Maharashtra state, though people from Saitwal community can be found in all over India. 

The community is majority among Digambar Jains in Maharashtra. They are predominantly in profession of tailoring and have been spread in pockets of Vidarbha, Marathwada, Khandesh and in small proportion in Western Maharashtra as well. 

Mostly the financially weaker section among otherwise well to do jains. Over past few decades many of Saitwal jains have achieved socioeconomic development with education and entrepreneurship. 

Last year this community was awarded OBC status by government though it was deprived of such privileges for many years even after remaining weaker section of society due to misconception of being an integral part of elite Jain community.

==Religious organizations==

'''Sylvia Cadeski''' (July 27, 1920 &amp;ndash; May 25, 2017), known professionally as '''Saucy Sylvia''', was a Canadian-born American [[comedian]], classically trained pianist, [[singer]], and [[radio personality]].

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Saucy Sylvia was born '''Sylvia Cadeski''' in [[Owen Sound]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] in 1920, and grew up in the small village of Mount Forest.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;  At age 6, she began playing the piano, which she learned from the nuns at Sisters of St. Joseph Academy.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt; She played in a country band in high school.   Sylvia eventually graduated from the Conservatory of Music in Toronto.  She later left the university of Toronto with a teaching degree and a masters in languages and while in school, she worked at a small local radio station and hosted her own radio show while in college in Toronto.

She decided she really wanted to try show business, and went out on the road.  While she played in Indiana, a bandleader named [[Barney Rapp]] landed her audition as a staff vocalist, and before long Saucy went on the air at [[WLW]] in Cincinnati.  At the time it was [[Clear-channel station|clear channel]] and could be heard all over the country.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;

Sylvia was a staff singer; at the time two young sisters also sang at the station [[Rosemary Clooney]] and Betty Clooney.  Big names dropped by the "Sylvia Show" like [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Duke Ellington]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the same time, Sylvia played a steady gig at the La Normandie Restaurant for five years and eventually moved to Detroit, MI with her first husband Mike Stoun where she worked comedy in her act.  She toured off and on and in Arizona, a promoter billed her as "Saucy Sylvia" on the marquee, giving Sylvia her first new name.  After her husband died, she continued performing across the country.  She recorded two albums "Sex is the thing that started it all" and "0069". She eventually moved to Newport, Rhode Island where she met her second husband Mike Mureddu.&lt;ref name=magnet/&gt;

===Style===

Saucy was known to engage her audience directly, making them part of the act.  Women from all over the world (estimated over ½ million) wear "I walk for Sauce" buttons announcing their affiliation of the Saucy Sylvia fan club.  The Walk for Sauce fan club song was sung and the celebration continued through almost three hours without a break.&lt;ref name=magnet&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/2011/07/06/from-the-desk-of-don-fleming-saucy-sylvia/|title=From the Desk of Don Fleming:Saucy Sylvia|author=Fleming, Don|year=2014|publisher=Magnet Magazine|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saucy's memory was one of the things that made her so special.  Part of her act involved asking audience members for their names and where they were from.  She would then include each person's name in songs and comedy, no matter how large the audience.  What was intriguing was her ability to capture all ages from college to seniors.

===Later career===
For Saucy, work was a labor of love.  Saucy became the President of the Newport Federation of Musicians.  She retained that role for more than 20 years working to finding work for area musicians in films and large venue shows.   Saucy played the Auld Mug Lounge at the Goat Island Hotel which changed names ownership from Sheraton to the  Double Tree, and now Hyatt.  Saucy is known as an icon in Newport, Rhode Island and the Auld Mug lounge was her room for over 30 years where she entertained millions from around the work including national and international dignitaries and international celebrities.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal/&gt;  Saucy had one of the last live music radio shows "The Miss Saucy Sylvia Show" which aired on [[WADK]] every Sunday for 26 years.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newportri.com/newportdailynews/news/page_one/a-dream-comes-true/article_4a3e7aa5-09a6-5105-b9dd-c2fb1fe0c384.html|title=A dream comes true|publisher=Newport Daily News|author=Johnson, James A.|date=May 31, 2014|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was first approached by the radio station to do the show, her husband Mike was all for it and was trying to convince her to say yes.  She agreed on one condition.  He wrote the show each week.  Mike wrote, produced and directed and even became part of the act.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;  The show went on for 26 years starting in 1976.&lt;ref name=magnet/&gt;  The show featured many artist wither locally or coming in town for one of the music festivals.   Saucy was inducted in the Newport Jazz Hall of Fame in 2002 along with [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[George Wein]] for their achievements.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;

===Other endeavors===
Saucy was very active in the American federation of Musicians and was the President of the Newport, Rhode Island Federation of Musicians.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;  She started the music scholarship program for the Newport public schools.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;  She won many awards for her achievements including proclamations from both the City of Newport and the State of Rhode Island for her work.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt; In 2014, she was inducted into the Rhode Island Radio Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20140326/Entertainment/303269947|title=Tony Rizzini, Saucy Sylvia among inductees to R.I. Radio Hall of Fame|date=March 26, 2014|publisher=Providence Journal|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
After being widowed for three years, Saucy married Mike Mureddu, the father of eight children. Murredu died in May 2013.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newportri.com/obituaries/michael-mureddu/article_7bec4aba-cc6e-11e2-9339-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Michael Mureddu|date=June 3, 2013|publisher=Newport RI.com|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 21 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.

The concept of '''''Shatsthala''''' (ಷಟ್ಸ್ತಲ or ಷಟ್ ಸ್ಥಲ in [[Kannada]] language) or six Phases/States/Paths is pivotal to the [[Lingayat]] [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veerashaivism Mysticism|url=http://www.virashaiva.com/shat-sthala-veerashaivism-mysticism/|website=Shat-Sthala|publisher=www.virashaiva.com|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shatsthala'' is a conflation of ''Shat'' and ''Sthala'' which means 'six phases/states/levels' through which a person (a bhakta/seeker) advances in one's ultimate quest of realisation of the Supreme, or, simply put, enlightenment. (The word enlightenment used here refers to the Indian notion of enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=[[S. N. Balagangadhara|Balagangadhara, S.N.]]|title=On the Indian Notion of Enlightenment: reflections based on experience|url=https://www.academia.edu/7866603/On_the_Indian_Notion_of_Enlightenment_reflections_based_on_experience|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The Shatsthala comprises the ''Bhakta Sthala'', ''Maheshwara Sthala'', ''Prasadi Sthala'', ''Pranalingi Sthala'', ''Sharana Sthala'' and the ''Aikya Sthala''. The ''Aikya Sthala'' is the culmination where the soul leaves the physical body and merges with the Supreme.

# Bhakta: Bhaktasthala involves the worship of Guru, Linga and Jangama . When one understands the true meaning of this Sthala, one conceives the true meaning of the trinity of Guru, Linga and Jangama . Through this Sthala one becomes free from the desires of the body and mind and becomes a Bhakta by virtue of his/her belief in Shiva.
# Mahesha: Maheshasthala involves the actual practice of the above concept, which enables to lose the desire for material wealth, not coveting and not longing for unrighteous sensual pleasures.
# Prasadisthala: Prasaadisthala states that all things in this world are gifts of Shiva and whatever human receives as God’s gifts must be returned to him through the intermediacy of the [[Jangam]]a, who represents Shiva. 
# Pranalingi: Pranalingisthala makes one aware of the inner being. Here the seeker comes to believe that the Linga is the Jangama and all actions are transformed into prayers.
# Sharanasthala: Sharanasthala endows an individual with the feeling and knowledge of God’s presence in his/her own soul and begins a direct dialogue with Shiva.
# Aikya: Aikyasthala forms the final stage. A stage of the culmination of the sublime achievement. It is the unitary consciousness of Self and Shiva.&lt;ref name="shivayoga"&gt;[http://www.shivayoga.net/psychological-aspects-of-shiva-yoga_/ shivayoga.net, ''Psychological Aspects of Shiva-yoga'']&lt;/ref&gt;

While the origins of the ''Shatsthala'' may be traced to the ''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamas]]'', particularly the ''Parameshwaratantra'', with the evolution of [[Veerashaiva|Veerashaivism]] the evolution of concept of Shatsthala was also unavoidable. While Basava understood Shatsthala as a process with various stages to be attained in succession, the credit of refuting this and redefining ''Shatsthala'' goes to [[Channabasavanna]], Basava's nephew. Channabasavanna differed radically from his uncle and held that a soul can reach its salvation in any stage.

[[Sikhs]] first entered Nepal in the 18th century. Today, there is a small community of Sikhs living in Nepal, totaling around 7,000 people according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref name="State of neglet, the Kathmandu post"&gt;[http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/12/28/free-the-words/state-of-neglect/257527.html State of neglet, the Kathmandu post]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[Guru Nanak|Guru Nanak Dev]], the founder of Sikhism, spent more than a year meditating on a site now known as Nanak Math, located in Balaju, Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nepalitimes.com/article/Nepali-Times-Buzz/Nepali-Sikh-community-retaining-its-distinctive-religious-identity,1028 Little Punjab, Nepali Times]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Guru Nanak visited the math in 1516.&lt;ref name="sikhnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhnet.com/news/sacred-well-kathmandu-gurdwara-cleaned|title=Sacred well in Kathmandu gurdwara cleaned &amp;#124; SikhNet|publisher=sikhnet.com|accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following conflict with the British East India Company, Maharani [[Jind Kaur]], the youngest wife of Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]], managed to escape from the Punjab disguised as a servant girl and came to Nepal via Nepalgunj on 29 April, 1849. The Nepalese government gave her shelter. Later, she went to London, but those Sikhs who remained in Nepal started their livelihood there. A few Nepalgunj territories near the Indian border are still called Shikhhanpurwa, Jamunah and Bankatwa.&lt;ref name="State of neglet, the Kathmandu post"/&gt;

[[File:Cree Indian sun dancers, probably Montana, ca 1893 (LAROCHE 126).jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|Cree Indian Sun Dancers, probably Montana, {{circa|1893}}]]
The '''sun dance'''  is a ceremony practiced by some [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous people of United States of America]] and [[First Nations|Canada]], primarily those of the [[Plains Indians|Plains cultures]]. It usually involves the community gathering together to pray for healing. Individuals make personal sacrifices on behalf of the community. 

After [[European colonization of the Americas]], and with the formation of the [[Canada|Canadian]] and [[United States]] governments, both countries passed laws intended to suppress indigenous cultures and encourage assimilation to majority-European culture. They banned indigenous ceremonies and, in many schools and other areas, prohibited Indigenous people from speaking their native languages.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} In some cases they were not allowed to visit sacred sites when these had been excluded from the territory of reservations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

The sun dance was one of the prohibited ceremonies, as was the [[potlatch]] of the Pacific Northwest peoples.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;Powell, Jay; &amp; Jensen, Vickie. (1976). ''Quileute: An Introduction to the Indians of La Push.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press. (Cited in Bright 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Canada lifted its prohibition against the practice of the full ceremony in 1951. But in the United States, Indigenous peoples were not allowed to openly practice the sun dance or other sacred ceremonies until the late 1970s, after they gained renewed sovereignty and civil rights following a period of high activism, including legal challenges to the government.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Congress passed the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] (AIRFA) in 1978, which was enacted to protect basic civil liberties, and to protect and preserve the traditional religious rights and cultural practices of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Eskimo]]s, [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s, and [[Native Hawaiians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Cornell.edu|title=AIRFA act 1978.|work= |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1996-|accessdate=July 29, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060514134557/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1996-| archivedate=May 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Placing the Clan Poles.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Placing the clan poles]]
Several features are common to the ceremonies held by sundance cultures. These include dances and songs passed down through many generations, the use of a traditional drum, a sacred fire, praying with a [[ceremonial pipe]], [[fasting]] from food and water before participating in the dance, and, in some cases, the ceremonial piercing of skin and a trial of physical endurance. Certain plants are picked and prepared for use during the ceremony. 

Typically, the sun dance is a gruelling ordeal for the dancers, a physical and spiritual test that they offer in sacrifice for their people. According to the Oklahoma Historical Society, young men dance around a pole to which they are fastened by "rawhide thongs pegged through the skin of their chests."&lt;ref&gt;Young, Gloria A. "[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SU008.html Sun Dance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119163226/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/S/SU008.html |date=2012-11-19 }}." ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture.'' The Oklahoma Historical Society. Accessed 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While not all sun dance ceremonies include piercing, the object of the sun dance is to offer personal sacrifice for the benefit of one's family and community. The dancers fast for many days, in the open air and whatever weather occurs.  

At most ceremonies, family members and friends stay in the surrounding camp and pray in support of the dancers. Much time and energy by the entire community are needed to conduct the sun dance gatherings and ceremonies.  Communities plan and organize for at least a year to prepare for the ceremony. Usually, one leader or a small group of leaders are in charge of the ceremony, but many elders help out and advise. A group of helpers do many of the tasks required to prepare for the ceremony.

As this is a sacred ceremony, people are typically reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given a long history of [[cultural appropriation|cultural misappropriation]], Indigenous people are suspicious that non-Indigenous people may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and [[medicine man|medicine men]] are concerned that the ceremony should only be passed along in the right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. Not talking about this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed way in which a respected elder speaks, teaches, and explains a sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.

In 1993, responding to what they believed was a frequent desecration of the sun dance and other [[Lakota people|Lakota]] sacred ceremonies, US and Canadian Lakota, [[Sioux|Dakota]] and [[Assiniboine people|Nakota]] nations held "the Lakota Summit V". It was an international gathering of about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota. They unanimously passed the following 'Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whereas sacrilegious "sundances" for non-Indians are being conducted by charlatans and cult leaders who promote abominable and obscene imitations of our sacred Lakota sundance rites; ... We hereby and henceforth declare war against all persons who persist in exploiting, abusing, and misrepresenting the sacred traditions and spiritual practices of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people." - Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (1993)&lt;ref name="decwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality"], ''The Peoples Path''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="talisman"&gt;Taliman, Valerie (1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/warlakot.htm The 'Lakota Declaration of War' "], ''News From Indian Country,'' Indian Country Communications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, the 19th-Generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe of the Lakota asked non-Indigenous people to stop attending the sun dance (''Wi-wayang-wa-c'i-pi'' in [[Lakota language|Lakota]]); he stated that all can pray in support, but that only Indigenous people should approach the altars.&lt;ref name="LookingHorse1"&gt;Looking Horse, Chief Arvol (2003) "[http://www.newagefraud.org/olh3.html Protection of Ceremonies ''O-mini-c'i-ya-pi'']"&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was supported by keepers of sacred bundles and traditional spiritual leaders from the [[Cheyenne]], Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota nations, who issued a proclamation that non-Indigenous people would be banned from sacred altars and the Seven Sacred Rites, including and especially the sun dance, effective March 9, 2003 onward:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ''Wi-wanyang-wa-c'i-p''i (Sundance Ceremony): The only participants allowed in the centre will be Native People. The non-Native people need to understand and respect our decision. If there have been any unfinished commitments to the sundance and non-Natives have concern for this decision; they must understand that we have been guided through prayer to reach this resolution. Our purpose for the sundance is for the survival of the future generations to come, first and foremost. If the non-Natives truly understand this purpose, they will also understand this decision and know that by their departure from this ''Ho-c'o-ka'' (our sacred altar) is their sincere contribution to the survival of our future generations.&lt;ref name="LookingHorse1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In Canada ==
Though only some [[First Nations|nations]]' sun dances include the body piercings, the Canadian government outlawed that feature of the sun dance in 1895. It is unclear how often this law was actually enforced; in at least one instance, police are known to have given their permission for the ceremony to be conducted. The First Nations people simply conducted many ceremonies quietly and in secret. In 1951 Canada lifted its ban on the ceremony.&lt;ref name=AIRFA&gt;"American Indian Religions Freedom". Native American Rights Fund. ''Justice Newsletter.'' Winter 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The sun dance is practiced annually on many reserves and reservations in Canada.

Although the Government of Canada, through the Department of Indian Affairs (now [[Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada]]), persecuted sun dance practitioners and attempted to suppress the dance, the ceremony itself was never officially prohibited. But Indian agents, based on directives from their superiors, did routinely interfere with, discourage, and disallow sun dances on many Canadian plains reserves from 1882 until the 1940s. Despite this, sun dance practitioners, such as the Plains [[Cree]], [[Saulteaux]], and [[Blackfoot]], continued to hold sun dances throughout the persecution period.  Some practised the dance in secret, others with permissions from their agents, and others without the body piercing. The Cree and Saulteaux have conducted at least one Rain Dance (with similar elements) each year since 1880 somewhere on the Canadian Plains. In 1951, government officials revamped the Indian Act, dropping the prohibition against practices of flesh-sacrificing and gift-giving.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 1996: pp. 34-5; 1994 Mandelbaum, 1975, pp. 14-15; &amp; Pettipas, 1994 p. 210.

Regina: Canadian Plains Research Center. Pettipas, Katherine. (1994). ''Serving the Ties That Bind: Government Repression of Indigenous Religious Ceremonies on the Prairies.'' Winnipeg: University of Manitoba Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most sun dance cultures, it is forbidden to film ceremony or prayer. Few images exist of authentic ceremonies. Many First Nations people believe that when money or cameras enter, the spirits leave, so no photo conveys an authentic ceremony. But the [[Kainai Nation]] in Alberta permitted filming of their sun dance in the late 1950s. This was released as the documentary ''[[Circle of the Sun]]'' (1960), produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] .&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Alan |author2=John Corner |title=New Challenges for Documentary|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=90–91|isbn=0-7190-6899-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7byAre88gYC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Circle+of+the+Sun%22+low&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KNWCtjiWzD&amp;sig=8w0VGuqa3UMzUIx5_O4nRgS-6Iw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7TEZS4foKsO1ngeP9cjbAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Circle%20of%20the%20Sun%22%20low&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="curators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/circle-of-the-sun|title=Circle of the Sun|last=Low|first=Colin|author2=Gil Cardinal |work=Curator's comments|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manitoba]] archival photos show that the ceremonies have been consistently practised since at least the early 1900s.

'''''The Slugger''''' and '''''The Superstar''''' are a pair of [[religious tract]]s produced by [[Chick Publications]] and its controversial founder,  [[Jack Chick]].

The tracts are identical in plot line, but feature different characters, each aimed at a particular market.

==Plot Line==
In each tract, an athlete wins the world championship for his team, and as a result signs a multi-million dollar contract and also a multi-million dollar product endorsement.

The athlete's gardener, though, has the nerve to tell him that, without Christ, all his riches and fame are worthless.  The athlete gets angry at his gardener; however, after learning that he has terminal cancer, asks the gardener to share his faith.

The athlete accepts [[Christ]] as savior, and upon his death gives his entire estate to the gardener "because he's the only one who will use it wisely".

'''Theophilus Dunn''' (c. 1790{{spaced ndash}}October 1851) was a [[fortune teller]] from the [[Black Country]] village of [[Netherton, West Midlands|Netherton]] who achieved regional fame for his claimed abilities to tell fortunes, find lost valuables, and cast healing spells.

==Life==
Theophilus Dunn was born at the end of the 18th century and lived for many years in Netherton, near [[Dudley]]. He achieved some fame as a fortune teller and finder of lost objects, and as someone who could cast healing spells.&lt;ref name="raven"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raven |first=Jon |title=Stories, Customs, Superstitions Tales, Legends &amp; Folklore of the Black Country &amp; Staffordshire|publisher=Broadside|year=1986 |isbn=0-946757-03-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tump"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tump |first=Aristotle |title=A Memorable Medley of Great Black Country Characters |publisher=A Bugle Publication |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He supposedly was fairly well educated and could "cast a horoscope with as much facility almost as a [[Nostradamus]]".&lt;ref name="Hackwood"/&gt;

A number of stories are told of his prophesies such as warning the prizefighter, [[William Perry (boxer)|William Perry]] of his forthcoming defeat at the hands of [[Tom Sayers]].&lt;ref name="tump"/&gt;&lt;ref name="William Perry"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Perry|title=The Story behind a Statue|date=2011|publisher=Perry Beauchamp Publications|location=Dudley|isbn=9780956895004|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was known by some as the "Dudley Devil".&lt;ref name="Worcestershire Chronicle - obit"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of the " Dudley Fortune Teller." |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000350/18511015/024/0005 |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Worcestershire Chronicle |via=The British Newspaper Archive |date=15 October 1851|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An obituary in a local paper claimed that "he was the chief resource in times of difficulty or trial to half the lower classes of society in the district in which he resided". It was also stated that he was the "restorer of lost goods, the discoverer of stolen property, the healer of broken hearts" and that "apparently respectable persons" had travelled fifty to sixty miles for consultations with Dunn.&lt;ref name="Worcestershire Chronicle - obit"/&gt;

[[File:Ichthys.svg|thumb|A modern ''ΙΧΘΥΣ'' (″ichthys″) fish symbol]]
[[File:Ichthus.svg|thumb|An empty modern fish symbol]]
The '''ichthys symbol''', or ''Jesus fish'', typically used to proclaim an affiliation with or affinity for [[Christianity]], has many variations. Some of these are made by Christians in order to promote a specific doctrine or theological perspective, such as [[evolutionary creation]]. Other variations are sometimes intended for the purpose of [[satire]]. Both the traditional [[ichthys]] fish as well as its variations, are often seen adorning the [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] or [[Trunk (automobile)|trunks]] of [[automobile]]s, often in the form of adhesive badges made of [[chrome plating|chrome-colored plastic]]. While the fish symbol dates back millennia, having its origins in pre-Christian religious imagery, the many variations known today first appeared  in the 1980s.

The first appearances of fish symbols as adopted in Christian art and literature date to the 2nd century CE. Some modern fish symbol variations, called the ''Jesus fish'', contain the English word ''Jesus'' in the center, or are empty entirely.&lt;ref name=Temperman/&gt;&lt;!-- Text did go to article [[Ichtys]] : no lemma doublettes --&gt;

== Parodies ==
Jeroen Temperman states that there are "variations on this Ichthys symbol. Some variations add feet to the fish and inscribe ''Darwin'' in the body. Others make reference to sushi, sharks, the food chain, fast food, the devil or death. How are we to interpret these variations? These adaptations are themselves susceptible to multiple interpretations, ranging from humour to critique, to mocking derision, to blasphemy."&lt;ref name="Temperman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Temperman|first=Jeroen|title=The Lautsi Papers: Multidisciplinary Reflections on Religious Symbols in the Public School Classroom|date=6 September 2012|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9789004222519|page=43|quote=It stands for or represents something other than itself, that something else being Jesus Christ. It is directed primarily at some audience that knows how properly to interpret the symbol. It is on one level a reference to our invocation of Christ's invitation in Matthew to become "[[fishers of men]]". But it incorporates additional means as well. The fish symbol is a pictorial representation of the Greek word ''Ichthys'', which was itself used as an acronym for ''Iesous Christos, Theou Yios, Soter'', meaning "Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior". We also see variations on this Ichthys symbol. Some variations add feet to the fish and inscribe "Darwin" in the body. Others make reference to sushi, sharks, the food chain, fast food, the devil or death. How are we to interpret these variations? These adaptations are themselves susceptible to multiple interpretations, ranging from humour to critique, to mocking derision, to blasphemy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among such parodies are the ''Darwin fish'', often displayed by "[[Atheism|atheists]] and [[Freethought|freethinkers]]" in the United States,&lt;ref name="HooverClark2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoover|first1=Stewart M.|last2=Clark|first2=Lynn Schofield|title=Practicing Religion in the Age of the Media: Explorations in Media, Religion, and Culture|date=January 2002|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231120890|page=277|quote=Atheists and freethinkers have a visible presence in the United States.

"The Christians had the fish so we responded with the shark. If they want to portray themselves as weak fishes, OK. We are the strongest," said Emad who would only give his first name.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Darwin fish ===
[[File:Darwin Fish 01.svg|thumb|A Darwin fish with stylized legs resembling an [[Ichthyostega]]]]
The Darwin fish is a fish symbol with "evolved" legs and feet attached, and often with the word "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]" inside (like the ΙΧΘΥΣ or Jesus found in some Christian versions). It symbolizes the [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] of [[evolution]], for which Charles Darwin laid a foundation, in contrast with [[creationism]], which is a hallmark of American Christianity. The Darwin fish bears a stylized resemblance to [[Tiktaalik]] or [[Ichthyostega]], which are major examples of a [[transitional fossil]] of the first [[tetrapod]] that moved from sea to dry land during the [[Late Devonian]] period.

Closely related to the original Darwin fish symbol is a fish with legs, the word "evolve", and a hand that is holding a [[wrench]]. Another variant, the [[Darwin Awards]] fish, is a "dead fish" floating belly-up with the words "Darwin Awards" inside.

==== Responses ====
[[Image:Truth fish.jpg|thumb|200px|A Fish-hungry ichtys with the word "Truth" in it eating a Darwin fish, promoting a version of Christian [[Old Earth Creationism]] that rejects biological evolution]]
[[File:Jesus Fish variation promoting Evolutionary Creation - Theistic Evolution.jpg|thumb|200px|A Jesus fish variation promoting [[evolutionary creationism]], Ohio 2014]]
Christians, as well as the non-religious, have either responded to or made spin-offs of the Darwin fish. A design supporting a version of [[Old Earth Creationism]] that rejects biological evolution was made with a larger Jesus fish eating the Darwin fish.  Sometimes, the larger fish contains letters that spell the word "Truth".  A further development shows two fish, one with legs and labeled "I evolved", the other legless and labeled "You didn't".

Another variant has a Darwin fish with an open mouth, carrying away a smaller, dead Jesus fish by its tail. Other variants depict an "Evolution" or "Darwin" fish swallowing an "ΙΧΘΥΣ", "Jesus" or "Truth" fish; another version has a "Science" fish swallowing a "Myth" fish. Supporters of the theological concept of [[evolutionary creationism]], also known as theistic evolution, have responded with a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid variant]] of the Jesus fish in which the word "Jesus" is written inside an ichthus fish with stylized feet.

Still another variation has been offered by people who see no conflict between Christian belief and the evidence of science regarding evolution: a depiction of the Jesus fish and the Darwin fish kissing. Such images have been sold as bumper stickers and have also been improvised.&lt;ref&gt;Borgeson, Phina (2009, February 13)."Evolution and faith in dialogue." Episcopal News Service. https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/article/evolution-and-faith-dialogue&lt;/ref&gt; The writer [[Michael Dowd]], author of the book ''[[Thank God for Evolution]]'', has been among the more prominent promoters of this image.&lt;ref&gt;http://michaeldowd.org/photos/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
Rhetorical scholar Thomas Lessl conducted a survey of users of the Darwin fish emblem. Based on their responses, he interprets the symbol as scientific "[[blackface]]", a parody that is one part mockery and one part imitation.&lt;ref name="Lessl2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lessl|first1=Thomas M.|title=The Culture of Science and the Rhetoric of Scientism: From Francis Bacon to the Darwin Fish|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|volume=93|issue=2|year=2007|pages=123–149|issn=0033-5630|doi=10.1080/00335630701426785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessl suggests that the "various ideas that users plainly compress into this emblem are suggestive of [[scientism]]", and adds that the Darwin fish is an advertisement for the [[conflict thesis]], an idea, which according to Lessl, is "now thoroughly discredited by historians".&lt;ref name="Lessl2007"/&gt;

[[Jonah Goldberg]], in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticized the Darwin fish, stating that:
{{quotation|I find the Darwin fish offensive. First there's the smugness. The undeniable message: Those Jesus fish people are less evolved, less sophisticated than we Darwin fishes. The hypocrisy is even more glaring. Darwin fish are often stuck next to bumper stickers promoting tolerance or admonishing random motorists that "hate is not a family value." But the whole point of the Darwin fish is intolerance; similar mockery of a cherished symbol would rightly be condemned if aimed at blacks or women or, yes, Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-oe-goldberg1apr01-column.html|title=Evolution of religious bigotry|last=Goldberg|first=Jonah|date=1 April 2008|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the ''[[National Review]]'', Goldberg further stated that "one of the problems with the Darwin Fish is that it assumes all Jesus Fishers are Creationists. And I agree that this is one of the problems. But it is not the only one. The 'evolve' fish, I think has a double-meaning in that it suggests Christians should evolve from Christianity. I also think mucking about with the symbol of the fish is itself offensive because the symbol is sacred and has no secular counterpart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/161092/jesus-fish-agonistes-jonah-goldberg|title=Jesus Fish Agonistes|last=Goldberg|first=Jonah|date=2 April 2008|publisher=[[National Review]]|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science ===
[[File:Science Ichthys.jpg|thumb|Science fish-rocket, a parody of the ichthys symbol]]
The Science Fish is a parody of the traditional ichthys symbol that includes the addition of rocket stabilizer fins and is usually mounted or displayed at an angle as if launching into space.

=== Star Trek ===
[[File:Trekhtys.svg|thumbnail|"Trek Fish"]]
The "Trek Fish" was designed by [[Rod Roddenberry|Eugene "Rod" Roddenberry Jr.]], the son of ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]].  His motivations for doing so were as follows:{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

{{quote|Over a year ago I came up with the idea of a TREK FISH while noticing all the religious fish symbols on everyone's car.  I notice there were a number of variations that preached "Creationism" and others that supported "Darwinism".  I felt that the two were in conflict and a happy medium was needed.  TREK FISH does not preach or support one over the other.  To me, it simply says we can continue to discuss our origins but, as a [[human|species]], should focus on the future... | Eugene "Rod" Roddenberry Jr.}}

Although still fish-shaped, with the legend "TREK" inside, the "fins" parody the iconic shape of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roddenberry.com/roddenberry-trek-fish.html Image of the Roddenberry "Trek Fish"] from the Roddenberry website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flying Spaghetti Monster ===

Advocates of the [[Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster]], or Pastafarianism, which was created in 2005 to protest the [[Kansas evolution hearings|decision by the Kansas Board of Education]] to require the teaching of [[intelligent design]], have designed their own version of the fish symbol, with the Flying Spaghetti Monster's characteristic "noodly appendages" and eye stalks. Another more complicated design features the previously-mentioned "Jesus fish eating Darwin fish" with the Flying Spaghetti Monster in turn attacking the Jesus fish.

=== Cthulhu ===
[[File:Cthulhufish.jpg|thumb|[[Cthulhu]] has been depicted in a parody of the ichthys bumper ornament.]]
[[Cthulhu]] is a fictional giant creature, one of the Great Old Ones in [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]]. It is often cited for the extreme descriptions given of its appearance, size, and the abject terror that it invokes. Cthulhu is often referred to in science fiction and fantasy circles as a tongue-in-cheek shorthand for extreme horror or evil. It also has been depicted in a parody of the ichthys.

=== ''Artgemeinschaft'' ===
The German ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'' group, promoting [[racism|racist]] [[neopaganism]], uses a registered symbol showing an eagle catching an ichthys fish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asatru.de/versand/picture/aufkleber/fischadler.jpg Artgemeinschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/28153/302381058/DE Registration]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish-hungry sharks ===
In [[Egypt]], many [[Coptic Orthodox Christian]]s display the fish symbol on their vehicles as a sign of their faith, and Islamic fundamentalists responded with "fish-hungry sharks", some including the phrase "no god but Allah" within the body of the shark.&lt;ref name=Michael/&gt; One Egyptian Muslim was quoted in [[The Day (New London)|''The Day'']] as saying "The Christians had the fish so we responded with the shark. If they want to portray themselves as weak fishes, OK. We are the strongest."&lt;ref name=Michael/&gt;

=== Gefilte ===
[[File:Gefiltefish.JPG|thumb|"[[Gefilte fish|Gefilte]] fish" on an automobile]]
{{Main|Gefilte fish|Jewish humour}}
A humoristic parody of the symbol is a fish with the word "Gefilte" ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|t|ə|_|f|ɪ|ʃ}}; from {{lang-yi|געפֿילטע פֿיש}}, "filled fish") written in letters stylized to resemble [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] [[calligraphy]]. This refers to [[gefilte fish]], a common dish in [[Jewish cuisine]]; used on an automobile, it usually indicates that the driver of the car is culturally [[Jew]]ish, if not religiously.

=== Edible fish ===
A parody commonly seen in areas populated by those of Norwegian descent, is a fish containing the word "[[Lutefisk]]".

Another parody shows only the lower tail fin, and contains the words "n'Chips", a play on "[[Fish and Chips]]".

"[[Sushi]]" written inside the fish is one more variant.

'''Vegoia''' (Etruscan: ''Vecu'') is a [[nymph]] and/or [[sibyl]] within the [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] religious framework who is responsible for writing some parts of their large and complex set of sacred books, of initiating the Etruscan people to the arts, originating the rules and rituals of land marking, and presiding over the observance, respect and preservation of boundaries. Vegoia is also known as Vecu, Vecui, Vecuvia,&lt;ref&gt;''The Etruscan language: an introduction'', Giuliano Bonfante, Larissa Bonfante, 2002, 253 pages, p.210, webpage:
 [https://books.google.com/books?id=VWGN6e5Rzf8C&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;dq=-Begoe+Vecui+OR+Vecuvia Books-Google-VW].&lt;/ref&gt; Vegoe or else Begoe or even Bigois as it sometimes appears. (see: [[List of Etruscan mythological figures]]).

==In the Etruscan religious framework==
The actual Etruscan religious system remains mostly obscure. The Etruscan language is poorly understood, due to the lack of many bilingual documents comparable to the [[Rosetta stone]]. Therefore, the ancient Etruscan documents (8th, 7th, 6th centuries BCE) that would reflect their own proper conceptions do not yield much. Moreover, during the later period (5th through 1st centuries BCE) Etruscan civilization heavily incorporated elements of Greek civilization and eventually diluted itself in the Greco-Roman mixture of their powerful Roman neighbours. Lastly, while they formalized their religious concepts and practices in a series of "sacred books", most are no longer extant and known only through commentaries or quotes by Roman authors of the late 1st century:&lt;ref&gt;[[Granius Flaccus]] ("De indigitamentis", dedicated to Caesar), [[Nigidius Figulus]] (a friend of [[Cicero]] exiled by Caesar, from whom a [[brontoscopic]] calendar has been handed down through the works of a certain [[John the Lydian|Lydus]]), Herennius («De sacris Saliaribus Tiburtium», lost) , Messala («De auspiciis»), Trebatius («De religionibus»), Veranius («De libri auspiciorum», «Pontificales quaestiones», of which only fragments are known), [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] («Antiquitates rerum humanarum et divinarum», lost) and also some Etruscan-originating authors of the late 1st century BCE who tried to salvage bits and pieces of their native culture, such as Tarquitius Priscus (given as a contemporary of Cicero, originated from Tarquinia, author of «Ostentarium Tuscum», «Ostentarium arborium» known through some quotes by [[Macrobius]]), [[Aulus Caecina Severus (writer)|Aulus Caecina]] (originated from Volterra, a friend of Cicero, whose works are the basis of lengthy exposés concerning the interpretation of lightning strokes by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Plinius]] ), [[Cornelius Labeo]] (vaguely identified in-between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE), [[Martianus Capella|Marcianus Minneus Felix Capella]] even much later (5th century CE). (source: [[Georges Dumézil]], La religion romaine archaïque, Bibliothèque historique Payot, {{ISBN|2-228-89297-1}}, 1974, 2000, appendice sur la religion des Etrusques, p.670)&lt;/ref&gt;
and hence may be biased.

Two mythological figures have been set by the Etruscans as presiding over the production of their sacred books: a female figure, Vegoia, and a monstrous childlike figure gifted with the knowledge and prescience of an ancient sage, [[Tages]]. Those books are known from Latin authors under a classification pertaining to their content according to their mythological author (whether delivered through speeches or lectures, such as Tages, or inspiration).&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pallottino]], Etruscologia. Milan,Hoepli, 1942 (English ed.), The Etruscans. David Ridgway, editor. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1975, p. 154. Massimo Pallottino summarizes the known (but non-extant) scriptures as the Libri Haruspicini, stating the theory and rules of divination from animal entrails; the Libri Fulgurales, which were about[[divination]] from lightning strikes; and the Libri Rituales. The latter were composed of the Libri Fatales, which expressed the correct religious methods of founding cities and shrines, draining fields, formulating laws and ordinances, measuring space and dividing time; the Libri Acherontici, which dealt with the hereafter; and the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ostentarium|Libri Ostentaria]], which contained rules for interpreting prodigies. The revelations of the prophet Tages were given in the Libri Tagetici, which included the Libri Haruspicini and the Acherontici. Those of the prophetess Vegoia were given in the Libri Vegoici, which included the Libri Fulgurales and part of the Libri Rituales, especially the Libri Fatales.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The attributes of Vegoia==
The figure of Vegoia is almost entirely blurred in the mists of the past. Vegoia is mostly known from the traditions of the Etruscan city of Chiusi (Latin: Clusium; Etruscan: Clevsin; Umbrian: Camars) (now in the province of Siena). The revelations of the prophetess Vegoia are designated as the ''Libri Vegoici'', which included the ''Libri Fulgurales'' and part of the ''Libri Rituales'', especially the ''Libri Fatales''.

She is barely designated as a “nymph”, as the writer of the ''Libri Fulgurales'',&lt;ref&gt;Maurus Servius Honoratus, Commentarii in Virgilium, Aen, 6,72 "libri...Begoes nymphae, quae artem scripserat fulguritarum apud Tuscos"&lt;/ref&gt; which give the keys to interpreting the meaning of lightning strokes sent by the deities (using a cartography of the sky, which, as a sort of property division, was attributed to Vegoia;&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in ancient Etruria", by Jean-René Jannot, The University of Wisconsin Press,translated by Jane.K.Whitehead, 2005, p25&lt;/ref&gt; this assignment of sectors of the horizon to various deities is paralleled in the microcosm that is the liver of a sacrificed animal. The sacred divisions seem also to have a correspondence in the measurement and division of land, which since the very dawn of Etruscan history obeyed religious rules&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in ancient Etruria", by Jean-René Jannot, The University of Wisconsin Press,translated by Jane.K.Whitehead, 2005, p13&lt;/ref&gt;), as teaching the correct methods of measuring space &lt;ref&gt;She teaches a certain Arrunti Veltimno(« Die Schriften der römischer Feldmesser", by Friedrich Bluhme,edited K.Lachmann, printed by G.Reimer-Berlin,I, 1848, p350, mentioned by G.Dumézil in, La religion romaine archaïque, Bibliothèque historique Payot, {{ISBN|2-228-89297-1}}, 1974, 2000, appendice sur la religion des Etrusques, p623, or elsewhere written as Arruns Veltymnus, "Religion in ancient Etruria", by Jean-René Jannot, The University of Wisconsin Press,translated by Jane.K.Whitehead, 2005, p4&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Libri Rituales'', and as lording over their observation under threat of some dire woe or malediction,&lt;ref&gt;Jean-René Jannot, La Religion dans l'ancienne Étrurie[1]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAeKPQ8stZIC&amp;pg=PA13 on-line digitalized] {{en icon}} English version of the French original ''Devins, Dieux et Démons'' published by Picard in 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; thus establishing her as a power presiding over land property and land property rights, laws and contracts (as distinct of commercial contracts laws).

She is also indicated as having revealed the laws relative to hydraulic works,&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in ancient Etruria", by Jean-René Jannot, The University of Wisconsin Press, translated by Jane K. Whitehead, 2005, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; thus having a special relationship to "tamed" water.

Such an imposing system of "revealing" and "sacred texts" would be expected to have left some imprint on the neighboring italic peoples. Indeed, there is ample evidence of the Etruscan culture having heavily permeated their less-advanced Latin and Sabine neighbours' communities. This is for instance reflected in the Etruscan alphabet, itself derived from the Greek one, being solidly established as having inspired the Latin one. Also, the principles and architecture rules of their decimal numerals system are likewise at the origin of the Roman one, actually a simplified version (see: [[Etruscan numerals]]). Plus the symbols of supreme power (see [[Etruscan civilization]]), or the structure of the calendar in Rome (“itis” or “itus”, the Etruscan notion for the middle of the lunar month has given the Roman ''Ides'', [[Calends|''Kalendae'']], the Etruscan word for calendar, has given ''calendae'', the first day of the month; the Etruscan ''Craeci'' has given the word “Greeks” while those people named themselves ''Hellenes'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Langue étrusque (vocabulaire)|"Langue étrusque"]] (in French Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt;).

While the Roman religion has precious little written bases, they nonetheless had a kind of very abstruse set of texts known as the [[Sibylline Books]], which were under the exclusive control of special 'priests' ([[duumviri]], then [[decemviri]]) and were solely resorted to in times of ultimate crisis; the devolution of these 'books' to the Romans was, through some rocambolesque scene, attributed to [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquinius Superbus]], the last of the legendary kings of Rome, himself an Etruscan.

Likewise, one may suspect that the legend of [[Egeria (deity)|Egeria]], the nymph that inspired [[Numa Pompilius]] (the second legendary king of Rome that succeeded its founder Romulus; Latin "numen" designates "the expressed will of a deity"&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil, ''La religion romaine archaïque'', Bibliothèque historique Payot, {{ISBN|2-228-89297-1}}, 1974, 2000, ''appendice sur la religion des Etrusques'', p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;) the establishment of the original framework of laws and rituals of Rome, also associated with "sacred books". Numa is reputed to have written down the teachings of Egeria in "sacred books" that he made bury with him. When some chance accident brought them back to light some 400 years later, they were deemed by the Senate inappropriate for disclosure to the people and destroyed by their order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''The parallel lives, Numa Pompilius''.&lt;/ref&gt; What made them inappropriate was certainly of "political" nature but apparently has not been handed down by [[Valerius Antias]], the source that [[Plutarch]] was using. They were the same that interpreted for him the abstruse omens of gods (episode of the omen from [[Faunus]]&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil, ''La religion romaine archaïque'', Bibliothèque historique Payot, {{ISBN|2-228-89297-1}}, 1974, 2000, ''appendice sur la religion des Etrusques'', p.377.&lt;/ref&gt;), and also associated to beneficial water, would have some link&lt;ref&gt;Vegoia and Egeria&lt;/ref&gt; with the figure of Vegoia.

The '''Virgin of Mercy''' is a subject in [[Christian Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://panduranga-gallery.com/virgin-of-mercy.html | title=Virgin of Mercy | publisher=Panduranga Gallery | accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a group of people sheltering for protection under the outspread cloak, or [[pallium]] of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]]. It was especially popular in Italy from the 13th to 16th centuries, often as a specialised form of [[votive portrait]], and is also found in other countries and later art, especially [[Catalonia]] and Latin America. 

Usually the Virgin is standing alone, though if angels hold up the cloak, she is free to hold the infant Christ. The people sheltered normally kneel, and are of necessity shown usually at a much smaller scale. These may represent all members of Christian society, with royal crowns, [[mitre]]s and a [[papal tiara]] in the front rows, or represent the local population. The subject was often commissioned by specific groups such as families, confraternities, guilds or convents or abbeys, and then the figures represent these specific groups, as shown by their dress, or by the 15th century individual portraits. Sometimes arrows rain down from above, which the cloak prevents from reaching the people.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==
In Italian it is known as the '''Madonna della Misericordia''' (Madonna of Mercy), in German as the '''Schutzmantelmadonna''' (Sheltering-cloak Madonna), in Spanish '''Virgen de la Merced''' or '''Nuestra Señora de la Merced''' (Our Lady of Mercy), in French as the '''Vièrge au Manteau''' or '''Vierge de Miséricorde''' (Virgin with a cloak or Virgin of Mercy) in Catalan as the '''Mare de Déu de la Mercè''' and in Greek Orthodox Catholicism as '''Panagia tou Eleous''' or '''Merketta''' (Μερκέττα).

== Pictorial tradition in Christian art ==
[[File:Ravensburger Schutzmantelmadonna.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Ravensburger Schutzmantelmadonna'', c. 1480, attributed to [[Michel Erhart]]&lt;br&gt;Painted limewood. [[Bode Museum]], Berlin.]]
Probably the oldest version known is a small panel by [[Duccio]] of c. 1280, with three [[Franciscan]] friars under the cloak, in the Pinacoteca in [[Siena]]. Here the Virgin sits, only one side of the cloak is extended, and the Virgin holds her child on her knee with her other hand. 

A miniature of c. 1274 from the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] also shows a variant of the motif, as do 13th century paintings in [[Cyprus]], such as an icon in the Byzantine Museum in the [[Archbishop's Palace, Nicosia]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, pp. 60-61 (with illustration), 461; ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=q4hb_948o1AC&amp;pg=PT180&amp;dq=%22Virgin+of+Mercy%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U0wVh4mVeQJ2E4AGc5mSvK3E77srA#PPT180,M1 Miniature Painting in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia from the Twelfth to the Fourteenth Century]'', Sirarpie Der Nersessian, Sylvia Agémian, Annemarie Weyl Carr, Dumbarton Oaks, p. 159, 1993, {{ISBN|0-88402-202-1}}. A South German chalice may also be older, see Vasilake, 307, note 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The common factor between all these is the influence and presence of Western [[mendicant]] orders, especially the Franciscans, who appear to have been important in spreading this form of [[iconography]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 460.&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate inspiration of the iconography comes from a vision reported in the ''Dialogus Miraculorum'' of the [[Cistercian]] [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] which circulated widely from about 1230.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TI8O9C60s-EC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=%22Madonna+della+Misericordia%22++painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U0z0DiQobYZOmVERoXCJWVK8QQpsA ''Imagining Childhood: Themes in the Imagery of Childhood''], Erika Langmuir, p.237, note 56, Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-10131-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond that, the origins of the image may relate to rituals and a vision or miracle connected with a famous icon in the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Blachernae Church]] in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Vasilake, 308.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This gave rise in the [[Byzantine Rite]] ([[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]) to the [[The Protection of the Mother of God|Pokrov]] icons, although the image is not found in [[Byzantine art]]. In the Pokrov icons the thought is similar, but the image is usually less literal — the veil with which the Virgin protects mankind is small and held either in her hands or by two angels,&lt;ref&gt;Neil K. Moran; [https://books.google.com/books?id=3dcUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=pokrov+icon&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U1N6OmsFbF6o5ogi4_a8vX4AJEBCA#PPA126,M1 ''Singers in Late Byzantine and Slavonic Painting''], p.126ff, BRILL, 1986, {{ISBN|90-04-07809-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the Western version with a larger cloak is found in some Eastern Orthodox icons, one of a number of Western iconographic features that infiltrated Orthodox art, whether in [[Cyprus]] under the [[Crusade]]rs&lt;ref&gt;Vasilake, 307ff; [[:File:Icon 03050 Pokrova Bogorodicy. Seredina XVII v. Ukraina.jpg|17th century Ukrainian example]]&lt;/ref&gt; or 16th-century Eastern Europe. 

The image also fits well with the words of the ancient hymn ''[[Sub tuum praesidium]]'', probably composed in the 3rd century, and used in most pre-Reformation churches of both the Western and Eastern churches.

Usually the image, whether in sculpture or painting, stands by itself. Nevertheless, in the most famous example, the [[Madonna della Misericordia (Piero della Francesca)|Madonna della Misericordia altarpiece]] (1445-1462) in [[Sansepolcro]] by [[Piero della Francesca]], the subject is the central panel of a large [[altarpiece]], with a smaller Crucifixion above it, and many other panels. 

The image came in for special derision from [[Martin Luther]], who compared it to "a hen with her chicks".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spanish ''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'' of the 1530s, where those sheltered are a group connected with the Spanish voyages to the [[New World]], including American indigenous peoples, the group is shown over a panorama of ships at rest in a harbour.

In Germany during the Middle Ages, an almost identical image was used featuring [[Saint Ursula]], usually holding her [[Emblem|attribute]] of an arrow to avoid confusion.&lt;ref&gt;See the Commons category note for three examples&lt;/ref&gt;

In this pictorial tradition, also the iconography of the [[Works of mercy]] alludes sometimes to the Virgin of Mercy, such as [[Caravaggio]] in his huge [[The Seven Works of Mercy (Caravaggio)|painting in Naples]], because in 1606/07 it was commissioned for the church of the Confraternita del Pio Monte della Misericordia.&lt;ref&gt; Bühren 2017, pp. 67 and 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veneration ==
The [[liturgical feast day]] of Our Lady of Mercy is celebrated annually in the Latin Catholic calendar on September 24.

Our Lady of Mercy is the co-patroness, along with [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]], of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Venice in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dioceseofvenice.org/about-dov/our-diocesan-crest/ "Our diocesan crest", Roman Catholic Diocese of Venice in Florida]&lt;/ref&gt;

Churches dedicated to her include the cathedral of [[Guasdualito]] in [[Venezuela]] and the National Shrine of La Virgen de las Mercedes, also known as "El Santo Cerro" in [[La Vega, Dominican Republic]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.conectate.com.do/articulo/santo-cerro-la-vega-republica-dominicana/|title=Santo Cerro {{!}} La Vega, República Dominicana|website=www.conectate.com.do|language=es-ES|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other contexts ==
The term "Virgin of Mercy" is found in a number of other contexts not directly related to the image. It is a common translation of the [[Eleusa]] type of icon of the Virgin and Child. 

The Virgin of Mercy is patron saint of Barcelona, celebrated in the week-long [[La Mercè]] festival each year, but in this role is not especially associated with this type of image. The [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy]], founded, also in Barcelona, in 1218 by Saint [[Peter Nolasco]], has used the image but is not particularly associated with it.

In [[Santería]], the Virgin of Mercy is [[syncretism|syncretized]] with [[Obatala]].

'''Wen Zhong''' ({{zh|s=闻仲|p=Wén Zhòng}}) is a character in the classic Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]''. Wen Zhong had been the top ranked official under King [[Di Yi|Da Yi]] since the times of old. Following the death of Da Yi, Wen Zhong would crown [[King Zhou of Shang|Zi Shou]] as the new king of the [[Shang Dynasty]]. In short time, Wen Zhong would head out on his great dragon to subdue rebelling demons within the North Sea (an action that would take over fifteen years). 

Throughout Wen Zhong's fifteen years of battle, he would be destined to play a very large role in the schemes of Heaven. By decree of the [[Jade Emperor]] himself, Wen Zhong would attain a third eye atop his forehead. This third eye could see through any level of disillusion and falsehood. Upon Wen Zhong's arrival at the Noon Gate, he would greet his colleagues and see the absurdness of the situation; immediately Wen Zhong would order the king to come before him. After listening to the king's bickering, and easily seeing through to his true deluded idiocy, Wen Zhong would invite his allies to attend to the situation.

Wen Zhong was appointed as the [[deity]] of Puhua Tianzun (普化天尊) in the end.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' Chapter 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle''''' is a monthly [[Jewish]] [[newspaper]], published in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. It was established in 1921 by a pair of [[German Jew]]s, Nathan J. Gould and Irving G. Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mki.wisc.edu/Resources/Online_Papers/proceedings/byers.html ''Chronicling a Community: Milwaukee's Jews and the Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle'', Steve Byers, UW-Milwaukee]&lt;/ref&gt; The editor is Rob Golub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jewishchronicle.org/about/|title=About|date=2016-02-16|work=Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Golub won two 2016 Milwaukee Press Club awards for Excellence in Journalism, for an editorial and a critical review in the Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://milwaukeepressclub.org/2016-excellence-in-journalism-awardees/|title=2016 Excellence In Journalism Awardees {{!}} Milwaukee Press Club|website=milwaukeepressclub.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former editor was Andrew Muchin who resigned after running an editorial calling for the resignation of then-[[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Binyamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish paper's editor resigns, Chronicle's chief had written editorial calling for Netanyahu to quit|work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=December 27, 1997|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BH8kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jkUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5970%2C798609|page=1B|author=Margo Huston}}&lt;/ref&gt;
