'''Fr. Acacio Valbuena Rodríguez''' (8 May 1922&amp;nbsp;– 4 May 2011) was the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Prefect]] for [[Roman Catholicism in Western Sahara|Western Sahara]]. He was ordained as priest in the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]] on 17 March 1945, and on July 10, 1994, [[John Paul II]] installed him in the Apostolic Prefecture of Western Sahara.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bvalbr.html Father Acacio Valbuena Rodríguez, O.M.I. †] Catholic-hierarchy.org&lt;/ref&gt; Rodríguez had an audience with [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in Rome on 8 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africamission-mafr.org/cerna.htm African Mission Website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105231147/http://www.africamission-mafr.org/cerna.htm |date=2009-01-05 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fr.

'''Alhurra''' ({{lang-ar|الحرة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ḥurrah}}'' {{IPA-ar|alˈħurra|}},&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The pronunciation differs depending on the [[variety of Arabic]], for example, {{IPA-arz|elˈħoɾɾɑ|lang}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "the Free One")  is a [[United States]]-based public Arabic-language [[satellite TV]] channel that broadcasts news and current affairs programming to audiences in the [[Middle East and North Africa]]. Alhurra is operated by the Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN), which also operates [[Radio Sawa]].

Its stated mission is to provide "objective, accurate and relevant news and information" to its audience while seeking to "support democratic values" and "expand the spectrum of ideas, opinions, and perspectives" available in the region's media.&lt;ref name="TheChannel-2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conniff|first=Brian|title=Alhurra x3|journal=The Channel|year=2007|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network has also tried to distinguish itself from its numerous regional competitors by providing access to more in-depth coverage of U.S. issues and policies and coverage of a broader range of opinions and perspectives than normally heard on other Arab television networks.&lt;ref name="TheChannel-2007" /&gt;

Alhurra began broadcasting on 14 February 2004 to 22 countries across the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. It has established itself as the third highest-rated pan-Arab news channel, surpassing viewership ratings for the [[BBC]] (English and Arabic), [[France 24]] Arabic, RTV Arabic, [[CGTN Arabic|CCTV]], [[CNN International|CNNi]], and [[Sky News Arabia|Sky Arabia]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In April 2004, an additional channel called Alhurra-Iraq was launched, featuring most of the Alhurra content, with additional programming specifically directed at the [[Iraq]]i audience. It is also broadcast on [[satellite television|satellite]] and is available on terrestrial antennas throughout Iraq, including in [[Basra]], and [[Baghdad]]. [[Alhurra-Iraq]] consistently achieves higher ratings in Iraq than both [[Al Jazeera]] and [[Al Arabiya]].

==Organization and funding==

The MBN is a non-profit organization financed through a grant from the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), an independent federal agency funded by the [[U.S. Congress]].  The BBG oversees all U.S. [[public broadcasting]] outlets and is intended to act as a firewall to protect the editorial independence and professional integrity of the broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), About|url=http://www.bbg.gov/about/|accessdate=30 August 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723180946/http://www.bbg.gov/about/|archivedate= 23 July 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhurra’s headquarters are in [[Springfield, Virginia]].  The network also maintains bureaus in [[Baghdad]] and [[Dubai]], production centers in [[Beirut]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Cairo]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], as well as correspondents throughout the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], the [[United States]] and [[Europe]].

==History==
[[File:Alhurra's first broadcast -- February 14, 2004.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Alhurra's studio during their first live broadcast, 14 February 2004]]

The decision to launch Alhurra was prompted by frustration among U.S. government officials over perceived anti-American bias among the leading Arab television networks and the effect these channels were having on Arab public opinion regarding the U.S. Alhurra was intended to serve as an alternative to these channels by presenting the news in a more "balanced and objective" manner in an effort to improve the image of the United States in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="60_Minutes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leung|first=Rebecca|title=The Image War |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/14/60minutes/main617617.shtml|accessdate=2011-08-30|publisher=CBS News|date=14 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alhurra logo.svg|thumb|right|150px|Alhurra logo between February 2004 – November 2009]]

The driving force behind the launch of Alhurra was [[Norman Pattiz]], a media executive and founder and chairman of broadcast industry giant [[Westwood One (1976–2011)|Westwood One]]. While serving as a member of the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), the U.S. federal agency that controls all foreign non-military radio and TV broadcasts, Pattiz advocated strongly for the creation of a U.S.-funded television network specifically directed at Arab audiences. Pattiz had also previously been responsible for the creation of [[Radio Sawa]], a BBG-administered Arabic-language radio network which broadcast a mix of music, entertainment, and news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Norman J. Pattiz, Forbes.com Profile|url=https://people.forbes.com/profile/norman-j-pattiz/86314|accessdate=30 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720223228/http://people.forbes.com/profile/norman-j-pattiz/86314|archivedate=20 July 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea to launch Alhurra stemmed from the success that Radio Sawa had exhibited in reaching young audiences in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Broadcasting Board of Governors: Finding The Right Media For The Message In The Middle East (PDF)|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/108hrg/95841.pdf|author=U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, April 29, 2004|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pattiz believed that Arab audiences' views of the United States were being negatively influenced by existing Arab news networks' focus on coverage of the wars in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]]. He argued that by presenting a wider range of perspectives on these conflicts and other U.S. policies, as well as a coverage of a broader variety of regional and global issues of interest to Arab audiences, a U.S.-funded [[satellite TV]] channel could help improve America's image in the region.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|last=Inskeep|first=Steve|title=Profile: New Arabic language network the Bush administration is launching called Al Hurra |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-90905480.html|accessdate=27 August 2011|publisher=NPR|date=7 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appearance on CBS's ''[[60 Minutes]]'' in May 2004, Pattiz described a powerful promotional video he helped produce which led to the successful launch of Alhurra:

:"We showed the negative images that people get of the United States on Middle Eastern television," says Pattiz. "There was lots of anti-U.S. demonstrations—burning the president in effigy, stomping on the American flag. We then said, 'And this is what you see from America.' And we had about 4 seconds of black screen."&lt;ref name="60_Minutes" /&gt;

As a result of Pattiz's efforts, the Bush administration requested funding for the channel from Congress, and obtained $62 million in funding for its first year of operation (including start-up costs). In the fall of 2003, construction began to renovate an old TV channel building in Springfield, VA into a modern broadcast facility for the new channel. Construction was completed less than six months later, and Alhurra's first broadcast aired 14 February 2004.&lt;ref name="60_Minutes" /&gt;

==Awards==
In 2016, Alhurra Television’s documentary series "Delusional Paradise" won the Silver Award at the Cannes Corporate Media &amp; TV Awards.&lt;ref name="bbg.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbg.gov/networks/mbn/|title=BBG|website=BBG|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the promotional video for the "Delusional Paradise" won a Bronze medal at the New York Festivals International Television &amp; Film Awards.&lt;ref name="bbg.gov"/&gt;

In 2014, three Alhurra shows won the Special Jury Award at the ''[[CINE]]'' Golden Eagle Awards.&lt;ref name="CINE fall 2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cine.org/fall-2013-cine-golden-eagle-recipients/ |title=Fall 2013 CINE Golden Eagle Recipients|publisher=CINE|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alhurra prizes 2014"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alhurra.com/content/alhurra-win-prizes-documentary-reality-tv-promotion/242196.html |title=Three Worldwide Prizes to 'Alhurra Channel' for Creative Televised Works|publisher=Alhurra|accessdate=26 January 2014}}{{link language|Arabic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBG 2014"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbg.gov/blog/2014/05/21/alhurras-street-pulse-wins-cine-special-jury-award/ |title=Alhurra’s Street Pulse Wins CINE Special Jury Award |publisher=[[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] | accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Street Pulse'' ({{lang-ar|نبض الشارع}}), ''Where are We Going'' ({{lang|arz|رايحين على فين}}) and a promotional clip for the project ''Syrian Stories'', have won prizes in 2014.

''Street Pulse'' won the prize of the best documentary in the Middle East for the year 2013, especially for the episode ''the Tragedy of Quarry Workers in [[Minya Governorate|Minya]]'' ({{lang|ar|مأساة عمال المحاجر في المنيا}}).

Alhurra broadcasts 24 hours a day and, like other BBG-run broadcasters, is [[television advertisement|commercial]]-free. In addition to reporting regional and international news, the channel provides information on a variety of subjects, including the rights of women, human rights, religious freedom, freedom of expression, health, entertainment news, sports, and science and technology.  The network supplements its original programming with broadcasts of Arabic-[[subtitled]] versions of English-language programs familiar to U.S. (and global) audiences, such as [[PBS]]’s ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' and ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'', [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]]’s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' and ''[[Modern Marvels]]''.  In addition, the network reversions and repackages prominent American news and news magazine series, such as the [[PBS]] ''[[Newshour]]'' and [[CBS]]’ ''[[60 Minutes]]'' into its own Arabic-language feature news programs.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Alhurra's studio -- February 2011.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Alhurra's current broadcast studio, February 2011]]

== Viewership ==

Alhurra competes with more than 550 Arabic-language satellite TV channels for its audience in the [[Middle East]], and as a result Alhurra initially struggled after its launch in 2004 to attract viewers in the already-crowded Arab media market.  Annual surveys commissioned by the BBG showed that Alhurra's weekly audience grew by 28% between 2004 and 2008, surpassing 25 million.&lt;ref name=WP-2008&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitlock|first=Craig|title=U.S. Network Falters in Middle East Mission|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/22/AR2008062201228_2.html?sid=ST2008062302295/|accessdate=2011-08-28|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent surveys by international research organizations including [[ACNielsen]] show that Alhurra has consistently averaged approximately 26 million weekly viewers in its broadcast region from 2009–2011. While this number is dwarfed by the overall viewership of [[Qatar]]-funded channel [[Al-Jazeera]] and [[Saudi Arabia]]-funded [[Al-Arabiya]], it is nevertheless greater than the viewership of all other non-indigenous Arabic-language news networks (including [[CNN Arabic]],  [[BBC Arabic Television|BBC Arabic]] and [[France24]]’s Arabic-language channel) combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott|first=Kim Andrew|title=In BBC Radio 4 documentary, Alhurra is described as 1) funded by the US Defense Department and 2) a failure (updated: MBN response)|url=http://kimelli.nfshost.com/?id=11640|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{More citations needed|date=April 2015}}
A BBG-commissioned poll in February 2011 found that 25% of Egyptians living in [[Cairo]] and [[Alexandria]] tuned into Alhurra during the protests in that country in January 2011, surpassing [[al-Jazeera]]’s 22% viewership during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quarter of Egyptians Tune to Alhurra During Recent Crisis|url=http://www.bbg.gov/pressroom/press-releases/Quarter_of_Egyptians_Tune_to_Alhurra_During_Recent_Crisis.html|publisher=BBG|accessdate=2011-08-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928141211/http://www.bbg.gov/pressroom/press-releases/Quarter_of_Egyptians_Tune_to_Alhurra_During_Recent_Crisis.html|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a traditional viewership survey, [[University of Maryland]]/[[Zogby International|Zogby]] polls of several Arab nations ([[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[UAE]]) asked which channels viewers tuned into most often. Just 2% overall stated that Alhurra was the channel they turned to most often in 2008, and that number dropped to 1% in 2009 (this poll added Egyptian respondents).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Annual Arab Public Opinion Survey (PDF) |url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/events/2009/0519_arab_opinion/2009_arab_public_opinion_poll.pdf |publisher=University of Maryland/Zogby International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924012351/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/events/2009/0519_arab_opinion/2009_arab_public_opinion_poll.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the channel’s popularity has shown some signs of improvement in recent years, particularly in [[Iraq]], which has proven to be Alhurra's most successful market in the Arab world. A 2005 [[Ipsos]] poll found that just 14% of Iraqi respondents tuned into Alhurra (ranking 11th place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Snyder|first=Alvin|title=Al-Hurra: Struggle for Legitimacy|url=http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=74004&amp;d=1&amp;m=12&amp;y=2005&amp;pix=opinion.jpg&amp;category=Opinion|accessdate=2011-08-30|newspaper=Arab News|date=1 December 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811002856/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=7&amp;section=0&amp;article=74004&amp;d=1&amp;m=12&amp;y=2005&amp;pix=opinion.jpg&amp;category=Opinion|archivedate=11 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2008 [[Ipsos]] poll of Iraqi viewers found the network’s popularity had increased to 18%, overtaking Al Jazeera (15%). This improvement could be due to Alhurra’s launch of Alhurra-Iraq, an Iraq-focused channel with programming tailored especially to the Iraqi audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snyder|first=Alvin|title=Alhurra Locates the "Arab Street" (Jan 7, 2009)|url=http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/index.php/newswire/cpdblog_detail/alhurra_locates_the_arab_street/|publisher=USC Center on Public Diplomacy|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its FY2010 budget submission, the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG) noted that the channel’s viewership had improved to 5th place in the Iraqi market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Board of Governors Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Request (PDF)|url=http://media.voanews.com/documents/bbg_fy10_budget_request.pdf|publisher=BBG|accessdate=2011-08-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015052852/http://media.voanews.com/documents/bbg_fy10_budget_request.pdf|archivedate=15 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats to journalists==
Alhurra journalists and correspondents have frequently faced threats, intimidation, and violence from both government and non-state actors opposed to their coverage.

Some notable incidents include:
* In August 2012, Syrian authorities reportedly injured and detained Alhurra reporter, Bashar Fahmy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alhurra correspondent injured and seized in aleppo|url=http://www.alhurra.com/content/alhurra-correspondent-injured-and-seized-aleppo/210048.html|accessdate=2012-08-25|newspaper=Alhurra website|date=25 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2011, Yemeni authorities attacked an Alhurra reporter and photographer who were covering a sit-in taking place in front of the Vice President's house in [[Sana'a]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attempt to kidnap Abdul Karim Al Khaiwani and Al Hurra channel reporters attacked|url=http://www.anhri.net/en/?p=2685|accessdate=2011-08-29|newspaper=Arabic Network for Human Rights Information|date=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2011, Alhurra reporter Abdel Karim Al-Shaibani was assaulted and beaten by unknown assailants on a street in [[Sana'a]], [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Authorities in Yemen begin to target foreign journalists, six deported|url=http://www.newswatch.in/newsblog/9088|accessdate=2011-08-28|newspaper=Newswatch.in|date=15 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928211520/http://www.newswatch.in/newsblog/9088|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2011, Alhurra's [[Cairo]] bureau was targeted during the unrest in [[Egypt]]. Unknown armed men stormed its offices and "threatened to kill Al-Hurra's two on-air journalists—Akram Khuzam and Tarek El Shamy—if they didn't leave the building."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cairo attacks continue; reporter dies from earlier shooting|url=http://www.cpj.org/2011/02/press-attacks-cairo-reporter-dies.php|accessdate=28 August 2011|work=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=4 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726035150/http://www.cpj.org/2011/02/press-attacks-cairo-reporter-dies.php|archivedate=26 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Beginning 2 February 2011, Alhurra's [[satellite]] signal was jammed for nearly a month by Libyan authorities in response to coverage of anti-government protests in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Journalists detained and broadcasts jammed in Libya|url=http://www.cpj.org/2011/03/journalists-detained-and-broadcasts-jammed-in-liby.php|accessdate=28 August 2011|work=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=1 March 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726041312/http://www.cpj.org/2011/03/journalists-detained-and-broadcasts-jammed-in-liby.php|archivedate=26 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2010, Tahrir Kadhim Jawad, a [[freelance journalist]] and contributor to Alhurra, was killed when a bomb attached to his car exploded in [[Al-Karmah|Garma]], [[Iraq]], west of [[Baghdad]] in [[Anbar province]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Freelance cameraman slain in Iraq|url=http://www.cpj.org/2010/10/freelance-cameraman-slain-in-iraq.php|accessdate=2011-08-28|newspaper=Committee to Protect Journalists|date=4 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726070423/http://www.cpj.org/2010/10/freelance-cameraman-slain-in-iraq.php|archivedate=26 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2010, Mauritanian police beat several journalists and briefly detained Hachem Sidi Salem, a local correspondent for the satellite television channel Alhurra, for covering a strike by members of the National Bar Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of the Press 2010 – Mauritania|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=7874&amp;year=2010&amp;pf|publisher=Freedom House|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2008, Alhurra TV correspondent Saad Qusay was forced to request around-the-clock police protection at his home in [[Basra]] after being threatened by a militant group. The authorities subsequently advised Qusay to leave the country temporarily as an additional safety measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another interior ministry initiative to protect journalists|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,RSF,,IRQ,,4900267c1e,0.html|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=2011-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical controversies==

=== Allegations of pro-American bias ===
The fact that Alhurra is funded by the U.S. Congress through the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG) has led some critics to claim that the channel is "state [[propaganda]]" and presents its news with a pro-American bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lieven|first1=Anatol|last2=Chambers|first2=David|title=The limits of propaganda (op-ed)|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/13/opinion/oe-lieven13|accessdate=2011-08-28|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhurra has openly tried to distinguish itself from the perceived anti-American tone of its competition. Executives in the channel's early days instructed broadcasters to avoid the use of "loaded" terms (such as "martyr," "resistance fighters," or "occupation forces") used frequently on networks such as [[al-Jazeera]] in reporting about the U.S. military operation in [[Iraq]], opting for terms like "armed groups" and "U.S. and coalition forces."&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt;

Alhurra is observed by Arab journalists as complying too scrupulously with embargoes on military information when Western media outlets frequently disregard these same requests. Steve Tatham, a [[British Royal Navy]] officer, recorded an instance in which a British officer briefed Arab and Western media that a humanitarian aid ship was being held back pending operations against Iraqi insurgents in the area. According to Tatham's account, when the officer asked the media to delay reporting this information for security reasons, [[Fox News]] disregarded the request whereas Alhurra complied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sakr|first=Naomi|authorlink=Naomi Sakr|title=Arab Television Today|year=2007|publisher=I.B. Tauris|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mouafac Harb, Alhurra's first news director who resigned from the organization in 2006, claimed that he left in part because he "sensed the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] wanted Alhurra to promote [[U.S. foreign policy]] instead of just reporting the news." Harb claimed that at Alhurra there had been a "tendency to please Washington and not the [Arab] audience."&lt;ref name=WP-2008 /&gt;

=== Allegations of anti-American bias ===
Alhurra has also faced criticism from American conservative pundits who claimed that the organization had been broadcasting "anti-American" content. In 2007, conservative columnist [[Joel Mowbray]] wrote a series of harshly critical op-eds in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', claiming that Alhurra had become a "platform for [[terrorists]]." Mowbray noted that Alhurra had broadcast live, unedited speeches by [[Hezbollah]] leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] and [[Hamas]] leader [[Ismail Haniyeh]], an interview with an alleged [[al-Qaeda]] operative who expressed joy at the [[9/11 attacks]], and a panel whose members offered conspiracy theories about alleged Israeli plans to destroy the [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mowbray |first=Joel |title=Television Takeover |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009801 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=2014-04-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323081540/http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009801 |archivedate=23 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mowbray also cited unnamed Alhurra staffers who accused news director Larry Register of "trying to pander to Arab sympathies" to make the channel more like [[Al Jazeera]]. Register – a veteran [[CNN]] producer who had been appointed as Mouafac Harb's successor with a charge to overhaul the channel's operations and increase viewership – was forced to resign as a result of the public uproar created by Mowbray's articles.&lt;ref name=WP-2008 /&gt;

A 2008 U.S. [[Inspector General]]'s office report noted that Alhurra has taken significant steps to tighten its procedures and policies in order to protect the credibility that is critical to fulfilling its mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of Inspection: Alhurra's Programming Policies and Procedures (PDF)|url=http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/106057.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors Office of Inspector General|accessdate=2011-08-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728040631/http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/106057.pdf|archivedate=28 July 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of administration and oversight ===
A critical ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and ''[[ProPublica]]'' report in 2008 stated that "there appeared to be little oversight of the daily operations" of Alhurra. The report criticized Alhurra's top executives and directors for either lacking Arabic-language proficiency or possessing a media background to ensure that the broadcasts met basic journalistic standards.&lt;ref name=propublica&gt;{{cite news|last=Linzer|first=Dafna|title=Lost in Translation: Alhurra – America's Troubled Effort to Win Middle East Hearts and Minds|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/19/60minutes/main4196477.shtml/|accessdate=2011-08-27|newspaper=CBS News and ProPublica|date=22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 report from the U.S. [[Inspector General]]'s office noted that inspectors "heard consistent reports of poor communication in the news operation." The inspector's main criticism was of the channel's news director Daniel Nassif, who was highlighted in reports of "newsroom management issues that were reported to the inspectors to have arisen during his tenure or remain unsettled from an earlier time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of Inspection: Broadcasting Board of Governors' Operations in Afghanistan |url=http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/139264.pdf|publisher=United States Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors Office of Inspector General|accessdate=2011-08-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110728040541/http://oig.state.gov/documents/organization/139264.pdf| archivedate= 28 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hiring of several employee's relatives also led to accusations of [[nepotism]].  However, the same report also determined that MBN exercised tighter editorial controls over its programming and maintained the editorial principles for balance and comprehensiveness found in the [[International Broadcasting Act]] of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Linzer|first=Dafna|title=Inspectors Keep Up Pressure on Alhurra, Say Effectiveness Still in Question|url=https://www.propublica.org/feature/inspectors-keep-up-pressure-on-alhurra-say-effectiveness-still-in-question/|accessdate=2011-08-28|newspaper=ProPublica|date=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Apollo Musagetes Pio-Clementino Inv310.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Apollo Citharoedus (Vatican)|Apollo Citharoedus]]'', showing a [[cithara]] with box tail-pieces (Museo Pio-Clementino).]]

An '''Apollo Citharoedus''', or '''Apollo Citharede''', is a statue or other image of [[Apollo]] with a [[kithara|cithara]] (lyre). Among the best-known examples is the ''Apollo Citharoedus'' of the [[Vatican Museums]], a 2nd-century AD colossal marble statue by an unknown Roman sculptor. Apollo is shown crowned with [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] and wearing the long, flowing robe of the Ionic bard. The statue was found in 1774, with seven statues of the [[Muses]], in the ruins of [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]' villa  near [[Tivoli, Italy]]. The sculptures are preserved in the Hall of the Muses, in the Museo Pio-Clementino of the  [[Vatican Museums]].

A marble sculpture now identified as ''[[Pothos (sculpture)|Pothos]]'' following a lost Greek 4th-century BC original by [[Skopas]] was restored as an ''Apollo Citharoedus''; it is conserved in the Great Hall of the Palazzo Nuovo, [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome. Another marble ''Apollo Citharoedus'' (2.29m), from a Hellenistic original attributed to [[Timarchides]], of the 2nd century BC,  also stands in the Great Hall of the Palazzo Nuovo.

[[Image:Fresco Apollo kitharoidos Palatino Inv379982 n2.jpg|thumb|left|''Apollo Citharoedus'', a wall-painting from the [[Palatine Hill|Palatine Antiquarium]]]]

Other examples include the ''[[Apollo of Mantua]]'' and the ''[[Apollo Barberini]]'', possibly a copy of the cult statue of the [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus]]; it is conserved in the [[Glyptothek]], Munich.

The '''Armoured Battalion''' ({{lang-no|Panserbataljonen}}) is an [[infantry]] unit of the [[Norwegian Army]]. Although it is categorised as an [[Armoured cavalry|armoured]] unit, the battalion (strictly a [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]]) primarily serves in the [[mechanised infantry]] role. As with the [[Telemark Battalion|Telemark Bataljon]] it also has a tank squadron equipped with the [[Leopard 2]] main battle tank. It was formed in 1987 and has participated in several international operations in the [[Balkans]] ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) and in [[Afghanistan]] ([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]). The battalion is a recognised as a cavalry unit for ceremonial purposes, so its enlisted soldiers are referred to as [[dragoons]] as opposed to privates, as is the case in most of the Norwegian Army.

==Organization==
*'''Kavalerieskadronen''' – The first squadron, known as ESK1, KavEsk or Kavalerieskadronen (The Cavalry Squadron) is a reconnaissance unit. Its roles also include artillery observation and sharpshooters. It also uses the [[CV90]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]]. The unit colour is blue. The Armoured Reconnaissance platoon in ESK1 has the motto "Primus Intrat, Exit Novissimus" meaning "First in, last out".
*'''Stridsvogneskadronen''' – The second squadron, known as ESK2, Strv esk 2 or Stridsvogneskadronen (The Armoured Squadron) is the battalion's main strike weapon. The squadron operates with the [[Leopard 2]] [[main battle tank]]. The unit colour is red.
*'''Stormeskadron 3''' – The third squadron, known as ESK3 or Stormeskadron 3 (Assault Squadron 3). The squadron's role is to support ESK2 with mechanised infantry support. The squadron is based on quick and aggressive assaults with infantry squads supported by their [[CV90]] infantry fighting vehicles. The unit colour is yellow. The Motto of the Esquadron is "Semper Paratus", which means always ready.
*'''Stormeskadron 4''' – The fourth squadron, known as ESK4 or Stormeskadron 4 (Assault Squadron 4). The squadron has the same role as that of ESK3. The unit colour is green, and their motto " Gulo ad arma, Plus Ultra" meaning "Wolverines to battle, continue forward" is in reference to their ability to push forward in combat.
*'''Kampstøtteeskadronen''' – The fifth squadron, known as ESK6 or Kampstøtte Eskadron 6 (Combat Support Squadron 6). The largest and most complex of the battalion's units, its capabilities include logistics support, repair and recovery, signals, medevac and mortar support. The unit is also responsible for the protection and operation of the battalion's base of operations. The unit colour is black. The squadron motto is "Volens et Potens" which means willing and able.
*'''Minkebataljonen''' – During operations the battalion is usually supported by elements of the Combat Service support battalion, Engineer battalion, Intelligence battalion, Artillery battalion and Medical Battalion as well as Military police and other elements that may be attached depending on the mission. This combat group is known as Minkebataljonen.

ESK5 is no longer operational. Its role as supporting the battalion's base of operations was transferred to ESK6.

The motto of the battalion is ''[[Bitit fyrst]]'' (Old Norse for "Strike First"), referring to the offensive role of the battalion.

==History==

At the end of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century Russian troupes began to actively perform in Baku. The most famous of these troupes was the theater group led by Polonsky. This troupe performed at the Tagiyev Theater for more than twenty years. The theatre, with its fixed repertoire, props and clothing stores, and many decorative designs, were performing five days a week. With the consent and permission of Polonsky, the building of the Tagiyev Theater was rented to various Azerbaijani theater groups on Fridays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rusdrama-az.com/history1.html Official website: Азербайджанскому Государственному Русскому Драматическому] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1756">'''Boeremusiek''' ([[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]: ‘[[Boer]] music’) is a type of [[South Africa]]n instrumental [[folk music]].  Its original intent was to be an accompaniment to social dancing at parties and festivals.

==History==
Boeremusiek is originally European, but once it was brought to South Africa and Namibia, it gradually changed and became its own style.

==Style==
A [[concertina]] is similar to an [[accordion]] and is the lead instrument in most Boeremusiek bands. There are many different types of concertinas, which is why Boeremusiek has so many unique sounds and styles, and the construction the concertina is what makes the different sounds in the Boeremusiek band; it depends on where the slots and holes are put makes the difference on the sound that the concertina makes.

A Boeremusiek band may include [[piano accordion]]s, button [[harmonica]]s, accordions, [[piano]]s, [[Pump organ|harmonium]]s and the [[guitar]], and sometimes, a [[cello]] or [[bass guitar]] may be seen.

The sound of a Boeremusiek band may depend on what region the band is from, seeing that Boermusiek’s intent is to be informal, instrumental dance music.

Today, there are many successful Boeremusiek bands that have recorded albums. Some famous bands and individual artists today include Klipwerf Boereorkes, Danie Grey, Nico Carstens, Taffie Kikkilus, Brian Nieuwoudt, Samuel Petzer, Worsie Visser and Die Ghitaar Man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeremusiek.org.za/EWhatIsBoerMusic.htm What is Boermusic?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeremusiek.org.za/ South African Traditional Boer Music Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="906">The '''real''' (plural ''réis'') was the currency of [[Portuguese Cape Verde]] until 1914. It was equal to the [[Portuguese real]]. Portuguese coins were used but banknotes were issued by the [[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]] specifically for Cape Verde starting in 1865. The real was replaced by the [[Cape Verde escudo|escudo]], at a rate of 1000 réis = 1 escudo.

==Banknotes==
In 1865, Portuguese notes were overstamped for use in Cape Verde. In 1897, notes specifically designed for Cape Verde were introduced, in denominations of 1000, 2500 and 5000 réis. Notes for 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 réis followed in 1909.

'''Decoupling and re-coupling''' during financial crises is typified by the decoupling hypothesis that, in 2007, held that Latin American and Asian economies, especially emerging ones, had broadened and deepened to the point that they no longer depended on the United States economy for growth, leaving them insulated from a slowdown there, even a fully fledged [[recession]]. Faith in the concept had generated strong outperformance for stocks outside the United States.
However, over the course of 2008, as fears of recession mounted in the United States, worldwide stock markets declined heavily. Contrary to the decoupling hypothesis, the losses were greater outside the United States, with the worst experienced in [[emerging markets]] and developed economies like [[Germany]] and [[Japan]]. Exports make up especially large portions of economic activity in those places, but that fact was not supposed to matter anymore in a decoupled world because domestic activity was thought to be so robust.&lt;ref&gt;"Decoupling: Theory vs. reality." International Herald Tribune. January 27, 2008. http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/01/27/business/26delink.php&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, after the slump the emerging countries experienced a strong recovery, much stronger than that in advanced economies.&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;{{cite news

The phenomenon of decoupling and re-coupling has been explained by observing that global demand for factors such as capital and raw material declines when one part of the world economy suffers a crisis, which benefits the remaining healthy parts of the world economy through lower interest rates and lower commodity prices.  However, once the crisis reaches the stage where global lenders suffer significant losses, they will cut back on their loan supply and interest rates for everybody will rise.&lt;ref name="krv"&gt;{{citation

== Organization theory ==
{{main|Decoupling (organizational studies)}}
In [[organizational theory]], ''decoupling'' refers to the creation and maintenance of gaps between formal, symbolic policies and actual organizational practices on the ground.&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;Meyer, John W., and Brian Rowan. 1977. "Institutionalized Organizations: Formal Structure as Myth and Ceremony," ''American Journal of Sociology'', 83: 340-63.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''recoupling'' is a process by which previously decoupled policies and practices become coupled, leading to substantive, rather than symbolic, compliance.&lt;ref name="www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca"&gt;[http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/amj.pdf Tilcsik, András. “From Ritual to Reality: Demography, Ideology, and Decoupling in a Post- Communist Government Agency,” ''Academy of Management Journal'', 53:6 (December 2010): 1474-1498.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hallett, Tim. 2010. “The Myth Incarnate: Recoupling Processes, Turmoil, and Inhabited Institutions in an Urban Elementary School.” "American Sociological Review." 75, 1: 52-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Espeland, Wendy. 1998. "The Struggle for Water: Politics, Rationality, and Identity in the American Southwest."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2068">The '''Estonian National Symphony Orchestra''' ({{lang-et|'''Eesti Riiklik Sümfooniaorkester'''}}) is the leading [[orchestra]] in [[Estonia]] and is based in the capital [[Tallinn]]. Founded as the '''Estonian Radio Symphony Orchestra''', it gave its first concert in a broadcast by [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling|Tallinn Radio]] on December 18, 1926. During the Soviet regime, in the 1950s, the orchestra became the first in the [[Soviet Union]] to perform the work of [[modernism (music)|modernist]] composers such as [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], and [[Carl Orff]], previously suppressed by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s regime.  Following the collapse of Soviet rule, the lifting of emigration restrictions, and the [[History_of_Estonia#Regaining_independence|rebirth of independent Estonia]] in 1991, almost half of the Orchestra's players migrated to [[First World|the West]] in search of better career opportunities. This exodus of talent plunged the Orchestra's fortunes into a depression. After the nadir of 1993, the Orchestra enjoyed a strong recovery under the leadership of conductor [[Arvo Volmer]].
[[Estonian National Opera]] concert hall has been the home of Estonian National Symphony Orchestra for two decades.

"'''Everybody'''" was the winner of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001]], performed in [[English Language|English]] by [[Tanel Padar]], [[Dave Benton]] and [[Soul Militia|2XL]], representing [[Estonia]]. The song was performed twentieth on the night, following [[Germany]]'s [[Michelle (German singer)|Michelle]] with "[[Wer Liebe lebt]]" and preceding [[Malta]]'s [[Fabrizio Faniello]] with "[[Another Summer Night]]". At the close of voting, it had received 198 points, with the win coming at the head of a 23-song field.

Estonia was the first Former Soviet Union country to win the Contest, with the second and third following shortly thereafter. Tanel had previously provided backing vocals for Estonia's [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]] [[Once in a Lifetime (Ines song)|entry]], sung by [[Eda-Ines Etti]], his then girlfriend.

Tanel and Dave were supported by a backing group of four, [[Soul Militia|2XL]], [[Lauri Pihlap]], [[Kaido Põldma]], [[Sergei Morgun]] and [[Indrek Soom]].

The song was followed as Estonian representative at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2002|2002 contest]], held in the Estonian capital of [[Tallinn]], by [[Sahlene]] with "[[Runaway (Sahlene song)|Runaway]]".

==Content==
Lyrically, the song is simply an invitation to party, with the duo singing that "every night's a Friday night". The song is famous for two major reasons. The first of these is that Benton is the oldest contestant to win the grand prize. The second is that he is the first black contestant to do so. [[Maarja-Liis Ilus]] has recorded a cover version.

==Central Agency for German Schools Abroad==
The Central Agency for German Schools Abroad (''Zentralstelle für das Auslandsschulwesen'', ZfA) is a part of this office.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bva.bund.de/EN/Topics/Central_Agency_for_schools_abroad/node.html Central Agency for Schools Abroad]." Federal Office of Administration. Retrieved on 23 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools that are a part of the ZfA network serve children of expatriates working for offices of German multinational companies and/or who live in major centres of economic and/or political operations. Schools in some locations emphasise ties to Germany and/or Germanness while others emphasize international connections and education and promote their instruction of the English language. Many German schools in the Middle East and the Far East emphasize international education, and many schools in developing countries have German-speaking groups as the minority in their student bodies.&lt;ref name=MoorePT90&gt;Moore, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f5Sa31fBsocC&amp;pg=PT90 PT90] (actual page number unstated).&lt;/ref&gt; Schools attracting English-speaking and local students have websites and materials in other languages. In other parts of the world German schools are catered to local German communities.&lt;ref name=MoorePT91&gt;Moore, [[Google Books]] [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=f5Sa31fBsocC&amp;pg=PT91 PT91] (actual page number unstated).&lt;/ref&gt; Within North America many schools emphasise ties to Germany, and there are some Saturday-only programs in operation on that continent.&lt;ref name=MoorePT90/&gt;

The '''Flag of Mercosur''' is the official vexilological symbol of [[Mercosur]].
==History==
[[File:Mão do Mercosul.JPG|thumb|left|Hand made wood [[handicrafts]].]]
The emblem was chosen in a contest promoted by the Communications Directorates of the Presidencies of the Member States, in which 1,412 works were presented, with the winner being the argentine designer Carlos Varau. The approval of the winning design took place at the XI Meeting of the Common Market Council (CMC), held on December 16 and 17, 1996, in the city of [[Fortaleza]], [[Ceará]], Brazil. In 2002, the Common Market Council regulated the use of the Common Market of the South, the acronym MERCOSUR and the Emblem / Logo of MERCOSUR, through the approval of Decision No. 17/02.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7341">The year 2006 was declared the '''International Year of Deserts and Desertification''' by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].&lt;ref name="UN_ARES58211_page2"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-58-211 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=58 |resolution_number=211 |highlight=rect_187,117_812,174 |page=2 |accessdate=2007-11-19|date=23 December 2003|title=International Year of Deserts and Desertification, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--The Year aims to raise $20 million from industry and governments and will spend half on co-funding research, and half on "outreach" activities.  It will be the biggest ever international effort to promote the Earth sciences.
Apart from researchers, who are expected to benefit under the Year's Science Programme, the principal target groups for the Year's broader messages are:

* '''Decision makers''' and politicians who need to be better informed about the how Earth scientific knowledge can be used for sustainable development     
* '''The voting public''', which needs to know how Earth scientific knowledge can contribute to a better society     
* '''Geoscientists''', who are very knowledgeable about various aspects of the Earth but who need help in using their knowledge for the benefit of the world’s population.
  
The research themes of the year, set out in 10 science prospectuses were chosen for their societal relevance, multidisciplinarity and outreach potential. The Year has 12 Founding Partners 23 Associate Partners and is backed politically by 97 countries representing 87% of the world’s population.  The Year was promoted politically at [[UNESCO]] and at the United Nations in New York by the People’s Republic of [[Tanzania]].

The Year is open to '''Expressions of Interest''' from researchers within each of its 10 themes.  The Outreach programme of the year is also now open to expressions of interest, and will work in a similar way by receiving and responding to bids for support from individuals and organisations worldwide.

The Year's '''Project Leader''' is former [[IUGS]] President Professor Eduardo F J de Mulder. The Year's '''Science Committee''' is chaired by Prof. Edward Derbyshire (Royal Holloway) and its '''Outreach Committee''' by Dr Ted Nield ([[Geological Society of London]]).

The International Year of Planet Earth project was initiated jointly by the '''[[International Union of Geological Sciences]]''' (IUGS)[http://www.iugs.org/] and the '''United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation''' ([[UNESCO]]) [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=29008&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html]. The 

'''UN press release''' reads: "By a draft on the International Year of Planet Earth, 2008, which the Committee approved without a vote on 11 November, the Assembly would declare 2008 the International Year of Planet Earth.  It would also designate the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) to organize activities to be undertaken during the Year, in collaboration with [[UNEP]] [http://www.unep.org/] and other relevant United Nations bodies, the International Union of Geological Sciences and other Earth sciences societies and groups throughout the world.  Also by that draft, the Assembly would encourage Member States, the United Nations system and other actors to use the Year to increase awareness of the importance of Earth sciences in achieving sustainable development and promoting local, national, regional and international action"     

The Year’s '''research themes''' are listed below.

'''The Project is backed''' by the following '''Founding Partners''': International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ([[IUGG]])[http://www.iugg.org/]; the International Geographical Union ([[IGU]]) [http://www.igu-net.org/]; the International Union of Soil Sciences ([[IUSS]]) [http://www.iuss.org/]; the International Lithosphere Programme ([[ILP]]) [http://www.sclilp.org/]; the National Geological Survey of the Netherlands ([[NITG-TNO]]) [http://www.nitg.tno.nl/ned/]; The Geological Society of London ([[GSL]])[http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/template.cfm?name=geohome]; the International Soil Reference and Information Centre ([[ISRIC]]) [http://www.isric.org/]; A consortium of the International Association of Engineering Geologists and the Environment ([[IAEG]]) [http://www.civil.ntua.gr/IAEG.html], the International Society of Rock Mechanics ([[ISRM]]) [http://www.civil.ntua.gr/IAEG.html] and the International Society of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering ([[ISSMGE]]) [http://www.issmge.org/home/index.asp?sid=296&amp;mid=1]; the International Union for Quaternary Research ([[INQUA]]) [http://www.inqua.tcd.ie/]; the American Geological Institute ([[AGI]]); the American Association of Petroleum Geologists ([[AAPG]]) [http://www.aapg.org/]; the American Institute of Professional Geologists ([[AIPG]]) [http://www.aapg.org/].

The '''National Intelligence Grid''' or '''NATGRID''' is the integrated intelligence grid connecting databases of core security agencies of the [[Government of India]] to collect comprehensive patterns of intelligence that can be readily accessed by intelligence agencies. It was first proposed in the aftermath of the [[26/11|terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008]].The government of India in July 2016 appointed Ashok Patnaik as the Chief Executive Officer of the National Intelligence Grid. The appointment is being seen as the government's effort to revive the project.

== Reason for establishment ==
The 26/11 attacks on Mumbai led to the exposure of several weaknesses in India's intelligence gathering and action networks. NATGRID is part of the radical overhaul of the security and intelligence apparatuses of India that was mooted by the then [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Home Minister]] [[P. Chidambaram]]. The [[National Investigation Agency]] and the [[Nctc india|National Counter Terrorism Centre]] are two organisations established in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home minister proposes radical restructuring of security architecture|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=56395|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of india}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the attacks, the American [[Lashkar-e-Taiba|Lashkar]] operative [[David Coleman Headley]] had visited India several times and done a recce of the places that came under attack on 26/11. Despite having travelled to India several times and having returned to the US through [[Pakistan]] or [[West Asia]], his trips failed to raise the suspicion of Indian agencies as they lacked a system that could reveal a pattern in his unusual travel itineraries and trips to the country. It is argued that had a system like the NATGRID been in place, Headley would have been apprehended well before the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Govt gives go-ahead for NATGRID|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-07/india/29628932_1_home-ministry-natgrid-ccs|newspaper=The Times of India|date=Jun 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and functions ==
NATGRID is an intelligence sharing network that collates data from the standalone databases of the various agencies and ministries of the Indian government. It is a counter terrorism measure that collects and collates a host of information from government databases including tax and bank account details, credit card transactions, visa and immigration records and itineraries of rail and air travel. This combined data will be made available to 11 central agencies, which are: [[Research and Analysis Wing]], the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], [[Financial intelligence unit]], [[Central Board of Direct Taxes]], [[Directorate of Revenue Intelligence]], [[Enforcement Directorate]], [[Narcotics Control Bureau]], [[Central Board of Excise and Customs|Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs]] and the [[Directorate General of Anti-Evasion|Directorate General of GST Intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rs. 1,100 crore for NATGRID|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3529461.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Natgrid CEO P Raghu Raman: New face of Intelligence|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-06-12/news/29647514_1_natgrid-warsaw-data|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATGRID is being implemented in four phases, the first two of which will be operationalised by 2014 at a cost of {{INR}}1,200 crores and the first data sets will be retrievable by early 2013. The [[Cabinet Committee on Security]] approved the first two phases in 2011. The same year, P. Raghu Raman was appointed the Secretary and CEO of NATGRID and tasked with the establishment of the grid. The implementation of the third and fourth phases are expected to require amendments to several laws to allow for the sharing and transfer of data on items such as property and bank transaction details and internet usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NATGRID to show its first result in 18 months|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-08/india/29633448_1_phases-natgrid-data|newspaper=The Times of India|date=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike the NCTC and the NIA which are central organisations, the NATGRID is essentially a tool that enables security agencies to locate and obtain relevant information on terror suspects from pooled data of various organisations and services in the country. It will help identify, capture and prosecute terrorists and help preempt terrorist plots.&lt;ref name="blogs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: NATGRID Chief Raghu Raman|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/06/29/qa-natgrid-chief-raghu-raman/|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal India|date=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opposition ==
NATGRID faced opposition on charges of possible violations of privacy and leakage of confidential personal information. Its efficacy in preventing terror have also been questioned given that no state agency or police force has access to its database thus reducing chances of immediate, effective action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NATGRID will prove to be a security nightmare|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/analysis/natgrid-will-prove-to-be-a-security-nightmare|newspaper=The Sunday Guardian|date=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATGRID claims to be protected by several structural and procedural safeguards and oversight mechanisms including that of external audits and technology safeguards.&lt;ref name="blogs" /&gt;

Accessibility of government databases may be controlled by various means, such as requirement of a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]], [[subpoena]], or simple request from another branch of government.  Commercial databases are generally established for profit.  Data breaches may occur as a result of a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] or publication in error.

This is a survey of the '''[[postage stamp]]s and [[postal history]] of [[Tasmania]]''' (originally known as [[Van Diemen's Land]]), a former British colony that is now part of Australia.

==First stamps==
The first stamps of Van Diemen's Land were issued on 1 November 1853.&lt;ref name=sg&gt;''Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue: Commonwealth and British Empire Stamps 1840-1970''. 110th edition. London: [[Stanley Gibbons]], 2008, p. 27. {{ISBN|0-85259-653-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first stamps inscribed Tasmania were issued in January 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandafayre.com/atlas/oz.htm Tasmania.] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66WUvD1eh?url=http://www.sandafayre.com/atlas/oz.htm |date=2012-03-29 }} Sandafayre Stamp Atlas. Retrieved 24 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Until 1896, all postage stamps portrayed Queen Victoria. In 1899, a pictorial set was issued and was reprinted several times until 1912. Tasmania's last issue was in 1913.

This model is based on a painting of [[Russell Falls]] by [[Haughton Forrest]].

==Postal fiscals==
Between 1882 and 1900, revenue stamps of 1863 to 1900 were valid for postage. These [[postal fiscal]]s remained in use unofficially until 1903.

The '''Royal Swazi Sun Hotel''' is a major entertainment complex in the [[Ezulwini Valley]] of [[Swaziland]]. Founded in 1965, the complex is located 4 hours from [[Johannesburg]] by road. It is home to a casino, a par-72 golf course, and a spa. The hotel features 149 rooms and is known for its luxurious accommodation. Business Insights called the Royal Swazi Sun Hotel the flagship of Sun International's four hotels in the area.&lt;ref&gt;"The making of Africa's Eden." African Business Jan. 1999: 24. Business Insights: Essentials. Web. 20 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

It opened in 1965, three years prior to Swaziland's independence. It was the first casino-hotel in the region.&lt;ref name="Lea2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lea|first=John|title=Tourism and Development in the Third World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQWKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24|accessdate=20 November 2016|date=2006-12-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134986750|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was important as a major resort in the area that did not adhere to the 
[[Apartheid]] policies of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Comment on integration at Royal Swazi Hotel and Casino|publisher=New York Times|date=28 September 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casino is considered an important part of the country's foreign exchange and serves 250,000 people a year, primarily from neighboring South Africa and Mozambique as well as Italy, Switzerland and France.&lt;ref name="Cyr2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cyr|first=Ruth|title=Twentieth Century Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlhwTte8pbkC&amp;pg=PA485|accessdate=20 November 2016|year=2001|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595189823|pages=485–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The golf course has hosted many professional tournaments, and is the venue for two current [[Sunshine Tour]] events, the [[Royal Swazi Sun Open]] and the [[Lombard Insurance Classic]].

'''SABC 2''' is a [[South African]] television channel owned by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC). SABC 2 broadcasts programming in [[English language|English]], [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], [[Venda language|Venda]], and [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]].

==History==
n 1 January 1982, two services were introduced, TV2 broadcasting in [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and TV3 broadcasting in [[Sotho language|Sotho]] and [[Tswana language|Tswana]], both targeted at a Black urban audience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rJ-uCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;ots=Sln_AqxOpB&amp;dq=TV2%20broadcasting%20in%20Zulu%20and%20Xhosa%20and%20TV3%20broadcasting%20in%20Sotho%20and%20Tswana%2C&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q=TV2%20broadcasting%20in%20Zulu%20and%20Xhosa%20and%20TV3%20broadcasting%20in%20Sotho%20and%20Tswana,&amp;f=true ''The Press and Apartheid: Repression and Propaganda in South Africa''], William A. Hachten, C.Anthony Giffard
Springer, 1984, page 222&lt;/ref&gt; The main channel, now called TV1, was divided evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. In 1985, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, using the channel shared by TV2 and TV3, which stopped broadcasting at 9:30pm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NcQZ1D366t8C&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=1YrdQsOkYU&amp;dq=%22Topsport%20Surplus%22%20sabc&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q=%22TV4%22%20%20&amp;f=true ''Communication and Democratic Reform in South Africa''], Robert B. Horwitz, Cambridge University Press, 2001, page 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were combined into a new service called CCV (Contemporary Community Values).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RxB1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22contemporary+community+values%22+sabc&amp;dq=%22contemporary+community+values%22+sabc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-5_PD3fjKAhUkJJoKHbH-Dw8Q6AEILDAC ''South Africa: Official Yearbook of the Republic of South Africa''], Department of Information, 1992, page 131&lt;/ref&gt; A third channel was introduced known as TSS, or TopSport Surplus, TopSport being the brand name for the SABC's sport coverage, but this was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational, non-commercial channel, in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22nntv%22+sabc&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22february+11%22++ ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 127&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1996, the SABC reorganised it's three TV channels with the aim of making them more representative of the various language groups. These new channels were called SABC 1, SABC 2 and SABC 3.

After the SABC restructured its television channels, taking the place of the old TV1 channel. The reduced prominence of Afrikaans angered many speakers of the language, although the channel still features a significant amount of Afrikaans programming, including a news broadcast every week night at 19:00 and weekends at 18:00.

[[M-Net]] seeing the market need, launched the [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] subscription channel [[KykNet]] in 1999 and followed in 2005 with the music channel [[MK (channel)|MK]] (originally known as MK89.) In 2009, Mnet launched Koowwe, a kids channel broadcasting in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]].

'''Sky Betting &amp; Gaming''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-based [[gambling]] company, owned by [[The Stars Group]], with headquarters in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]] and offices in [[Sheffield]], [[London]], [[Guernsey]], [[Rome]] and [[Germany]]. Sky Betting &amp; Gaming consists of five core brands: Sky Bet, Sky Vegas, Sky Casino, Sky Poker and Sky Bingo. It also owns online betting odds comparison site Oddschecker. Sky Betting &amp; Gaming also operates popular, free-to-enter football prediction game Soccer Saturday Super 6 and Sky Sports Fantasy Football.

In 2015, [[Sky plc]] sold an 80 percent stake in the company to [[CVC Capital Partners]] for £600 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/full?dockey=1323-12287879-5KT9JSBCOOQH7S7CFVUK55G1KA |title=Sky completes sale of Sky Bet to CVC Capital Partners |publisher=Sky plc |date=19 March 2015 |accessdate=2018-04-21|via=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Sky retaining a 20% stake in the company and agreeing to a long-term licence of the Sky brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30324770 |title=Sky sells majority stake in Sky Bet |publisher=BBC News |date=4 December 2014 |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, CVC and Sky agreed to sell Sky Betting &amp; Gaming to [[The Stars Group]] for £3.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sky Bet snapped up by Canadian betting giant Stars Group in £3.4bn mega deal|newspaper=Racing Post|author=Lee Mottershead|date=21 April 2018|url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/news/sky-bet-snapped-up-by-stars-group-in-2-8bn-mega-deal/328453|accessdate=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sky Bet==
[[File:Sky Bet.png|right|thumb|Sky Bet logo used since October 2017.]]
'''Sky Bet''' is the [[sports betting]] division of Sky Betting &amp; Gaming, with the majority of its operations run from Leeds. The company allows betting via its website, telephone, mobile apps and interactive television through [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]]. In August 2011 Sky Bet launched its Apple iPhone and iPad app and all markets are also available via Android devices. It remains one of the few sports betting companies in the UK not to operate traditional high street shops. The company was formerly known for the slogan 'It matters more when there's money on it'. In October 2011, a major new Sky Bet advertising campaign introduced the slogan ‘Nothing’s certain, that’s why it’s exciting’ and the concept of ‘What if?’, used by Sky Bet to advertise topical, sports betting special markets.

Sky Bet is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) ([[Gaming Control Board|GCB]]).

Sky Bet had a dedicated TV channel of the same name on Sky channel 864, which closed on 13 February 2012.

===History===
Sky Bet's origins lie in BSkyB's acquisition of Sports Internet Group in July 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/a1c7f52fecb345a9b575250b02b0e193/395361917bb945168154d53c63d3afce/introduction_to_sky_bet.pdf|title=An introduction to Sky Bet|accessdate=2009-01-22|archivedate=2014-03-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328160422/http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/a1c7f52fecb345a9b575250b02b0e193/395361917bb945168154d53c63d3afce/introduction_to_sky_bet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included the small telephone and [[Online gambling#Online sports betting|online sports betting]] based company Surrey Sports alongside two other companies; Planet Football and Opta Index. Surrey Sports was rebranded in July 2002 to create Sky Bet. The company grew in December 2006 when established online betting companies totalbet and ukbetting were consolidated into Sky Bet after BSkyB's purchase of [[365 Media Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2171146/sky-gambles-365-media-group|title=VNUNet: Sky gambles on 365 Media Group|accessdate=2009-01-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217083257/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2171146/sky-gambles-365-media-group|archivedate=2007-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky Bet features heavily (through advertising and shared content) on the former 365 Media Group sites, as well as skysports.com thanks to their common ownership and proximity (they are based in nearby [[Leeds]]). Sky Bet's success has prompted Sky to branch out within the betting and gaming industry. Former professional footballer and Sky sports pundit Jamie Redknapp is the face of Sky Bet's football betting product.

===Fast Withdrawal™===
In October 2017, Sky Bet became the first online bookmaker in the world to offer instant withdrawals from its online platform into customers‘ bank accounts. The technology was built in-house and is called Fast Withdrawal. Withdrawals reach the customers’ accounts within two hours, but the process can also take as little as a few seconds.  Upon rollout, the service was only available to Sky Bet customers with a Barclays bank account, although it will be compatible with other banking providers and payment processors in the near future.

=== Sky Bet Group Betting ===
In 2018, Sky Bet unveiled a new option that allows friends to create an [[accumulator bet]] together. This is one of the first online options to offer accumulators between people who know each other. In the past, friends have typically done group bets in person or through social media platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.skybet.com/s/article/Sky-Bet-Group-Betting|title=Sky Bet Introduces New 'Group Betting' Option|last=Butler|first=Megan|date=August 3, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sky Vegas==
[[File:Sky Vegas.png|right|thumb|Sky Vegas logo used since February 2018.]]
'''Sky Vegas''' is the company's primary [[online casino]] division. It currently offers an [[online casino]] website. The company's online casino offering is distinguished from the majority of its competitors in that it now plays in-browser rather than requiring a software download (currently being flash based, formerly distributed on CD). The company uses the slogan 'All the best games, all in one place'.

Sky Vegas is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) ([[Gaming Control Board|GCB]]).

Until 12 April 2011, Sky Vegas had a dedicated TV channel of the same name on Sky channel 864 (which was formerly called 'Sky Vegas Live'), when it was rebranded Sky Bet.

===History===
'Sky Bet Vegas' was created in March 2003, initially with only 3 fixed odds casino-style games called 'Juicy Jackpot', 'Top Spin' and 'Super Keno'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media247.co.uk/skydigital/newsarchive/2005/08/gambling_law_ch.php|title=Media247: New interactive Sky betting service|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name indicated, it was then part of Sky Bet but has since been made separate and rebranded to simply 'Sky Vegas'. When limitations on broadcasting Casino games through IDTV were lifted, the company began to offer games through its interactive facility alongside the Sky Vegas Live channel, which showed betting opportunities such as Virtual Horse and Greyhound races. Both the online casino and the television channel re-branded as Sky Vegas in January 2008, with the television channel later being renamed the Sky Bet channel in April 2011.

==Sky Casino==
[[File:Sky Casino.png|right|thumb|Sky Casino logo used since February 2018.]]
'''Sky Casino''' is the company's premium [[online casino]] site, with a focus on live table games.

==Sky Poker==
[[File:Sky Poker.png|right|thumb|Sky Poker logo used since February 2018.]]
'''Sky Poker''' is the company's [[online poker]] division, which allows users to play poker on their website using a browser, or via their download client. Like Sky Vegas, the company offers its service in browser as well as through the downloadable software. Sky Poker also has a mobile app, enabling users on the IOS platform to play poker on the go. Compatible with both iPhone and iPads, the tablet app was launched in May 2014, with the phone version following a few weeks later.

The company uses the slogan 'Up Your Game,' which tries to encourage players to increase their poker skills and knowledge through providing them with strategy articles and videos, alongside regular content from their Ambassador Neil Channing. Since 2007 Sky Poker had its very own TV channel which broadcast live coverage of hands that had been played at the Sky Poker tables. A presenter would talk through the show with a Poker Analyst present, who would give feedback and tips to help players improve their skills. The latest channel that Sky Poker TV broadcast on was Sky channel 861, although this ceased activity in March 2015. Due to Sky Betting &amp; Gaming becoming an independent company, Sky Poker since had to review its options going forward. Sky Poker TV still remains, broadcasting a live show every Tuesday on Sky Sports. The channel will still continue to produce popular content such as the Sky Poker Cash Games and the UK Poker Championships coverage.

In 2014, Sky Poker announced that poker professional Neil Channing would be their new brand Ambassador. Neil will support Sky Poker by appearing on Sky Poker TV, writing blogs and strategy articles and appearing at their very popular live event, the UK Poker Championships (UKPC) held at Nottingham based casino, Dusk Till Dawn.

Sky Poker is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) ([[Gaming Control Board|GCB]]).

===Tournaments===
*Live: Sky Poker used to run the Sky Poker Tour, although these have been put on hold until further notice.
*Live: Sky Poker is the official sponsor of the UK Poker Championships, in partnership with Nottingham-based casino Dusk Till Dawn. The £1,000 buy in event has attracted some extremely well known faces within the poker industry including November Niner James Akenhead, Barny Boatman and Dave 'Devilfish' Ulliott. The UKPC are held bi-annually, with a full ring event in February, and a 6-max version in August. In February 2015 Sky Poker managed to successfully meet their biggest live guarantee of £1,000,000, with the winner, Fraser Bellamy taking away £200,000.
*The Super Roller - Sky Poker's biggest weekly tournament held on Sundays. 
*Bounty Hunters - Sky Poker's most popular form of tournament, whereby players can win money for eliminating opponents.

*Sky Sports Bounty Hunter - A £33 buy-in tournament, which is also shown on [[Sky Sports]]. The action is action-packed and some of the guests who have featured in the studio to cover the tournament include [[Luke Schwartz]], [[Neil Channing]], [[Ian Frazer (poker player)]] and WPT champion McLean Karr.

Players can also "satellite" into a tournament, which means qualifying through a series of smaller tournaments, for a small amount of money. Prize pools are subject to change. Sky Poker also offers Cash Poker, Sit &amp; Go's and Omaha games.

===Sky Poker TV===
Channel 861 concluded in March 2015, although live shows still take place every Tuesday 10pm-midnight on Sky Sports 3.

*Top of the Pots - A countdown of the 10 biggest hands in cash poker that week.

==Sky Bingo==
[[File:Sky Bingo.png|right|thumb|Sky Bingo logo used since February 2018.]]
'''Sky Bingo''' is the company's [[online bingo]] division. The company uses the slogan 'Believe in Better Bingo', echoing Sky's 'Believe in Better'.

Sky Bingo is licensed and regulated by the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) ([[Gaming Control Board|GCB]]).

==Oddschecker==
'''Oddschecker''' is an [[odds]] [[Price comparison website|comparison website]], which compares the odds offered by the most popular betting companies that cater to British and Australian customers, including Sky Bet. It forms part of the betting content of some other sites, such as Bettingzone. The company also offers reviews and comparison of online gambling websites through its 'Casinochecker', 'Pokerchecker' and 'Bingochecker' sections.

Oddschecker was established in 2001 and acquired by Sky in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Week, http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/analysis/data-strategy/people-are-requesting-a-much-more-personalised-experience/4006185.article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer Saturday Super 6==
'''Soccer Saturday Super 6''' launched in 2008, is a free-to-enter online prediction game, whereby players must correctly predict the score lines of 6 selected matches in order to win the weekly jackpot of £250,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://super6.skysports.com/&lt;/ref&gt; There is a £5,000 consolation prize for the week's best performer if the jackpot is not won.

Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling is the face of Sky Sports Fantasy Football.

==Acquisition of GoldBet==
In April 2004, 365mediagroup or ukbetting as it was known at the time, the UK’s leading sports content and online gaming business, announced the acquisition of GoldBet SportWetten GmbH ("GoldBet"), the European online sports betting company, for a maximum consideration of €4.5 million, dependent on the achievement of certain performance criteria. For the year ended December 2003, GoldBet had recorded EBITDA of €260,000 on revenues of €8.5 million, with a net asset value of €246,415, and no bank debt.

Trevor Beaumont, ukbetting’s Managing Director of Gaming, believed Europe represented a significant growth opportunity for ukbetting and sought to leverage the European market, a market that he was familiar with as former Racing and Trading Director of Coral and Managing Director of Eurobet.

BSkyB then owned GoldBet in December 2006 after the purchase of 365 Media Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econsultancy.com/press-releases/088-press-release-acquisition-of-goldbet-moves-ukbetting-into-europe acquisition-of-goldbet]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">'''The Stiglitz Report: Reforming the International Monetary and Financial Systems in the Wake of the Global Crisis''' is a book on economics written by Nobel Laureate economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]], documenting the necessary changes and reforms of the international financial institutions in the wake of the [[Financial Crisis of 2008]], and the subsequent [[Great Recession]] arisen from it.

In October 2008, the President of the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]], [[Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann]], established the "Commission of Experts of the President of the UN General Assembly on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System" chaired by author and Nobel Laureate economist [[Joseph E. Stiglitz]]. This commission had the aim of proposing necessary reforms in the world financial system that would prevent another event like the [[late-2000s financial crisis]]. The report frames the crisis as part of a series of simultaneous crisis, those of [[Energy crisis|energy]], [[Food crisis|food]], [[Water scarcity|water]], and sustainability.

Besides Stiglitz, members of the commission included [[Andrei Bougrov]], [[Yousef Boutros-Ghali]], [[Jean-Paul Fitoussi]], [[Charles Goodhart]], [[Robert Johnson]], [[Jomo Kwame Sundaram]], [[Benno Ndulo]], [[José Antonio Ocampo]], [[Pedro Páez]], [[Avinash Persaud]], [[Yaga Venugopal Reddy]], [[Rubens Ricupero]], [[Eisuke Sakakibara]], [[Chukwuma Soludo]], [[Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul]], [[Yu Yongding]] and [[Zeti Akhtar Aziz]]. [[Jan Kregel]] acted as rapporteur.

The report goes through four main topics:

# Macroeconomic Issues and Perspectives
# Reforming Global Regulation to Enhance Global Economic Stability
# International Institutions
# International Financial Innovations
The concluding comments of the report blame flawed policies as well as unsound economic philosophies for the crisis. The report advocates for the global community to "work for a robust and sustainable recovery" and for changes that support "long-term, democratic, equitable, stable, and sustainable growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Stiglitz Report|last = |first = |publisher = The New Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1595585202|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Sweet Mother'''" is a [[highlife]] song by the [[Nigeria]]n and [[Cameroon]]ian singer [[Prince Nico Mbarga]] and his band [[Rocafil Jazz]]. Released in 1976, it remains one of the most popular songs in Africa.

The demo-tape of "Sweet Mother" was turned down by [[EMI]] in 1974, citing the song's "childish appeal." "Sweet Mother" was later also rejected by [[Decca Records]] and [[Philips Records]], before it was eventually released in December, 1976, by [[Rogers All Stars]], a Nigerian recording company based in [[Onitsha]].&lt;ref name=nicombarga&gt;[http://www.ngex.com/entertainment/pages/nicombarga.htm Prince Nico Mbarga: Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernghana.com/news2/1975/4/tribute-to-nico-mbarga-of-sweet-mother.html Tribute to Nico Mbarga of Sweet Mother], ''ModernGhana.com'' 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  

The song is a celebration of motherhood, sung in [[Nigerian Pidgin|Nigerian Pidgin English]]. The music is West African [[highlife]], with Congolese [[Soukous]]-style guitar [[fingerstyle guitar|finger-picking]]. 

"Sweet Mother" went on to become one of the most popular hits in Africa, selling over 13 million copies.&lt;ref name=nicombarga/&gt; Sometimes called ''Africa's anthem'', it was voted Africa's favourite song by [[BBC]] readers and listeners in 2004, coming before [[Brenda Fassie]]'s "Vuli Ndlela", [[Fela Kuti]]'s "Lady", [[Francois Luambo Makiadi|Franco]]'s "Mario" and [[Miriam Makeba]]'s version of "[[Malaika]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4137879.stm Sweet Mother is Africa's anthem], ''BBC'', 31 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
